{{History_of_Australia/Chronological}}
The '''federation of Australia''' was the process by which the six separate [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Crown colony|colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed a [[federation]]. By force of the [[Constitution of Australia]] on [[1 January]] [[1901]], the Australian colonies became the [[Commonwealth of Australia]], of which they became component states. 

Early efforts to bring about federation in the [[1850s]] and [[1860s]] were dogged by the lack of popular support for the movement. A number of conventions were held during the [[1890s]] to develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. Sir [[Henry Parkes]], Premier of [[New South Wales]], was instrumental in this process. [[Fiji]] and [[New Zealand]] were originally part of this process, but decided to opt out. 

== The federal idea ==



=== Federal Council ===

A serious movement for federation of the colonies arose in the late [[1880]]s, at a time when there was increasing [[nationalism]] amongst Australians, the great majority of whom were native born. The idea of being "Australian" began to be celebrated in songs and poems. This was fostered by improvements in transport and communications, such as the establishment of a [[telegraph]] between the colonies in [[1872]]. The Australian colonies were also influenced by other federations which had emerged around the world, notably the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Switzerland]]. 

[[Henry Parkes]], then the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, first proposed a Federal Council body in [[1867]]. After it was rejected by the Secretary of the State for the Colonies, the [[Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Duke of Buckingham]], Parkes brought up the issue again at a conference in [[1880]], this time the [[Premier of New South Wales]]. At the conference, representatives from Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia considered a number of issues including federation, communication, Chinese immigration, vine diseases and uniform [[tariff]] rates. Federation had the potential to ensure that throughout the continent, trade and commerce would be unaffected by [[protectionism]] and measurement and transport would be standardised. 

The final and successful push for the Federal Council came at an intercolonial conference in [[1883]], called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the [[German Empire|German]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] in [[New Guinea]] and [[New Caledonia]]. [[Samuel Griffith]], the [[Premier of Queensland]], drafted a Bill to constitute the Federal Council. The conference successfully petitioned the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Imperial Parliament]] to enact the bill as the ''Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885''.<ref>note 2, at 18-21.</ref>

As a result, a [[Federal Council of Australasia]] was formed, to represent the affairs of the colonies in their relations with the [[South Pacific]] islands. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join. The self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, as well as the [[crown colony|Crown Colonies]] of Western Australia and [[Fiji]], became involved. South Australia was briefly a member between [[1888]] and [[1890]]. The Federal Council had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to [[extradition]], regulation of fisheries etc., but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers or revenue of its own. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value.

Nevertheless, it was the first major form of intercolonial cooperation. It provided an opportunity for [[federalist]]s from around the country to meet and exchange ideas. The means by which the Council was established endorsed the continuing role that the Imperial Parliament would have in the development of Australia's constitutional landscape. In terms of the ''Federal Council of Australia Act'', the Australian drafters established a number of powers dealing with their "common interest" which would later be replicated in the Australian Constitution, especially [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|section 51]].

=== Opposition ===

The individual colonies were somewhat wary of federation. Smaller colonies in particular were wary of delegating power to a national government which they feared would be dominated by the more populous New South Wales and Victoria. Queensland feared the advent of national legislation (see [[White Australia Policy]]), which would restrict the importation of [[kanaka]] labourers and jeopardise its [[sugar cane]] industry. 

Smaller colonies also worried about the abolition of [[tariff]]s, which would deprive them of a large proportion of their revenue, and leave their commerce at the mercy of the larger states. New South Wales wanted to be satisfied that the federation's tariff policy would not be protectionist. Victorian Premier [[James Service]] described fiscal union as "the lion in the way" of federation. A further fundamental issue was how to distribute the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies there was the possibility that they could be required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. 

Furthermore, there was debate about the form of government that a federation would take. Experience of other federations was less than inspiring. In particular, the [[United States]] had experienced the traumatic [[American Civil War]]. The [[trade union]] movement and its political representatives, the forerunners of the modern [[Australian Labor Party]], were intensely suspicious of Federation. In particular, labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming the Senate as proposed was much too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist Colonial upper houses. They feared federation would distract attention from the need of [[reform movement|social]] and [[Labor relations|industrial]] reform, and further entrench the power of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] forces.

== Early constitutional conventions ==

In the early [[1890]]s two meetings established the need for federation and set the framework for this to occur. An informal meeting attended by official representatives from the Australasian colonies was held in 1890. This led to the first [[National Australasian Convention]], meeting in [[Sydney]] in 1891. [[New Zealand]] was represented at both the conference and the Convention, although there was no great likelihood that it would want to enter into the proposed federation. 

=== The 1890 conference ===

The 1890 conference was organised at the instigation of Sir [[Henry Parkes]]. The account of the calling of the 1890 conference usually begins with [[Robert Wynn Carrington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], the [[Governor of New South Wales]], goading the ageing Henry Parkes at a luncheon on [[15 June]] [[1889]]. Parkes reportedly boasted that he "could confederate these colonies in twelve months". Carrington retorted, "Then why don't you do it? It would be a glorious finish to your life."<ref>Martin, ''Henry Parkes'', at 383.</ref> Parkes the next day wrote to the [[Premier of Victoria|Victorian Premier]], [[Duncan Gillies]] offering to advance the cause of federation. Gillies's response was predictably cool given the reluctance of Parkes to bring New South Wales into the Federal Council. In October Parkes travelled north to Brisbane and met with Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] and Sir [[Thomas McIlwraith]]. On the return journey, he stopped just south of the colonial border and delivered the historic [[Tenterfield Oration]] on [[24 October]] 1889, stating that the time had come for the colonies to consider Australian federation.

Through the latter part of 1889 the premiers and governors corresponded and agreed for an informal meeting to be called. The membership was: New South Wales, Sir Henry Parkes (Premier) and [[William McMillan]] (Colonial Treasurer); Victoria, Duncan Gillies (Premier) and [[Alfred Deakin]] (Chief Secretary); Queensland, Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] (Leader of the Opposition) and [[John Macrossan]] (Colonial Secretary); South Australia, Dr [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] (Premier) and [[Thomas Playford II|Thomas Playford]] (Leader of the Opposition); Tasmania, [[Andrew Inglis Clark]] (Attorney-General) and [[Bolton Bird]] (Treasurer); Western Australia, Sir [[James Lee Steere]] (Speaker); New Zealand, Captain [[William Russell]] (Colonial Secretary) and Sir [[John Hall (New Zealand)|John Hall]].

When the conference met at the Victorian Parliament in Melbourne on [[6 February]], the delegates were confronted with a scorching summer temperature of 39.7<U+00B0>C in the shade. The Conference debated whether or not the time was ripe to proceed with federation. Whilst some delegates agreed it was, the smaller states were not as enthusiastic. Thomas Playford from South Australia indicated the tariff question and lack of popular support as hurdles. Similarly, Sir James Lee Steere from Western Australia and the New Zealand delegates suggested there was lukewarm support for federation in their respective colonies.

A basic question at this early assembly was how to structure the federation within the [[Westminster system|Westminster]] tradition of government. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' [[1867]], which had confederated the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], provided a model with respect to the relations between the federation and the Crown. There was less enthusiasm, however, for the [[centralization|centralism]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian Constitution]], especially from the smaller states. From the 1890 conference the Canadian federal model was no longer considered appropriate for the Australian situation.<ref>Williams J, "'With Eyes Open': Andrew Inglis Clark and our Republican Tradition" (1995) 23(2) ''Federal Law Review'' 149 at 165.</ref>

Although the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] provided another example, it was inevitable that the delegates should look to the Constitution of the United States as the other major model of a federation within the English-speaking world. It gave just a few powers to the federal government and left the majority of matters within the legislative competence of the States. It also provided that the Senate should consist of an equal number of members from each State while the Lower House should reflect the national distribution. Andrew Inglis Clark, a long-time admirer of American federal institutions, introduced the [[United States Constitution]] as an example of the protection of States' rights. He presented it as an alternative to the Canadian model, arguing that Canada was "an instance of amalgamation rather than federation."<ref>''Debates of the Australian Federation Conference'', at 25.</ref> The introduction by Deakin of [[James Bryce]]'s ''The American Commonwealth'' also had far-reaching influence.<ref>La Nauze, ''The Making of the Australian Constitution'' at 273.</ref>

The Melbourne conference ended with an agreement by the delegates that the time for federation had arrived.

=== The 1891 convention ===

The [[bicameral]] [[Parliament]] proposed at the 1891 Convention was to adopt the nomenclature of the [[United States Congress]]. This proposal provided the broad outline of federal government. The lower House was to be elected by districts drawn up on the basis of population, while in the Senate there was to be equal representation for each "province". This American model was mixed with the [[Westminster system]] by which the [[Prime Minister]] and other [[Minister]]s would be appointed by the representative of the Crown from among the members of the [[political party]] holding a majority in the lower House.

Sir [[Samuel Griffith]] identified with great clarity at the Sydney Convention perhaps the greatest problem of all: how to structure the relationship between the lower and upper houses within the federal Parliament. The main division of opinion centred around the contention of [[Alfred Deakin]], that the Lower House must be supreme, as against the views of [[Edmund Barton]], [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]] and others, that a strong Senate with co-ordinate powers was essential. Griffith himself recommended that the doctrine of responsible government should be left open, or substantially modified to accord with the federal structure.

Under the guidance of Griffith, a draft Constitution was produced. The document enumerated a substantial list of powers which would be given to the federal government, some derived from the ''British North America Act'' 1867, some from the US Constitution, some from the powers of the Federal Council of Australasia, among others. The importance of the 1891 draft Constitution was recognised by La Nauze when he declared that "The draft of 1891 is the Constitution of 1900, not its father or grandfather."<ref>La Nauze, note 11 at 78.</ref> The draft constitution was submitted to colonial parliaments but lapsed in New South Wales, after which the other colonies were unwilling to proceed.

== Later constitutional conventions ==

The revival of the federal movement stemmed from the growth of federal leagues and nationalist organisations that were committed to federation, like the [[Australian Natives' Association]]. There were two so-called People's Conventions held in [[Corowa]] and [[Bathurst]].

In [[1895]] a proposal was accept by the premiers of the Australian colonies to establish a new Convention by popular vote, with the resulting draft of the constitution being submitted to the electors in each colony in a [[referendum]]. The Convention held meetings over the course of a year, beginning first in [[Adelaide]] in [[1897]], later meeting in Sydney and culminating in Melbourne in March 1898. After the Adelaide meeting, the colonial Parliaments took the opportunity to debate the emerging Bill and to suggest changes. The basic principles discussed in 1891 were adopted, with the addition of the principle of [[responsible government]]. There was also a consensus for more [[democracy]] in the constitutional structure. It was agreed that the Senate should be chosen by popular vote with the voters in each State acting as one electorate.

A draft bill was drawn up in [[1898]] and sent to each colony to be ratified by the electorate. The Bill as accepted by the colonies went to Britain for ratification by the British Parliament.

== The Federal Constitution ==

The ''Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (UK)'' passed on [[5 July]] [[1900]] and received royal assent on [[9 July]] [[1900]]. On [[1 January]] [[1901]] the Proclamation of the Commonwealth of Australia was held in [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], Sydney. Sir Edmund Barton was sworn in as the interim [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], leading an interim Federal ministry of nine members.

The new constitution established a [[bicameral]] [[Parliament]], containing a [[Australian Senate|Senate]] and a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The office of [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] was established as the Queen's representative; initially, this person was considered a representative of the British government. The Constitution also established a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]], and divided the powers of government between the states and the new Commonwealth government.

The site of a federal capital was disputed heavily between the two arch-rivals [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]]; the compromise was that a separate territory (the [[Australian Capital Territory]]) would be established within New South Wales to hold a new capital, while Melbourne would be the capital until the new city was constructed. The site eventually chosen for the city would become [[Canberra]].

Today Federation is still an important event in Australian culture, and is taught in both Primary and Secondary schools throughout the country.
