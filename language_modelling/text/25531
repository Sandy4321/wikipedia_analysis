There are over 670 [[scheduled monument]]s in the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of [[Somerset]] in [[South West England]]. The county consists of a [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|non-metropolitan county]], administered by Somerset County Council, which is divided into five [[Districts of England|districts]], and two [[Unitary authority|unitary authorities]]. The districts of Somerset are [[West Somerset]], [[South Somerset]], [[Taunton Deane]], [[Mendip]] and [[Sedgemoor]]. The two administratively independent unitary authorities, which were established on 1 April 1996 following the breakup of the [[county of Avon]], are [[North Somerset]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset]]. These unitary authorities include areas that were once part of Somerset before the creation of Avon in 1974.<ref name=avon>{{cite web |url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950493_en_1.htm |title=The Avon (Structural Change) Order 1995 |accessdate=9 December 2007 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO)  }}</ref>

A [[scheduled monument]] is a nationally important archaeological site or monument which is given legal protection by being placed on a list (or "schedule") by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]]; English Heritage takes the leading role in identifying such sites.  The current legislation supporting this is the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]].  The term "monument" can apply to the whole range of archaeological sites, and they are not always visible above ground. Such sites have to have been deliberately constructed by human activity.  They range from [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] standing stones and burial sites, through [[Roman Empire|Roman]] remains and medieval structures such as castles and monasteries, to later structures such as industrial sites and buildings constructed for the World Wars or the [[Cold War]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/scheduled-monuments/ | title = Scheduled Monuments | accessdate = 9 September 2014 | publisher = English Heritage }}</ref>

There are 202 scheduled monuments in West Somerset. Some of the oldest, particularly on [[Exmoor]] and the [[Quantock Hills]] are Neolithic, Bronze Age or Iron Age including hill forts, [[cairn]]s, bowl barrows and other tumuli. More recent sites include several motte-and-bailey castles. [[Dunster Castle]] has been fortified since the late [[Anglo-Saxon]] period. After the [[Norman conquest of England]] in the 11th century, William de Mohun constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone [[shell keep]] was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of [[the Anarchy]]. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the [[Earl of Carhampton|Luttrell family]], who expanded it several times during the 17th and 18th centuries. The medieval castle walls were mostly destroyed following the siege of Dunster Castle at the end of the [[English Civil War]]. In the 1860s and 1870s, the architect [[Anthony Salvin]] was employed to remodel the castle to fit Victorian tastes; this work extensively changed the appearance of Dunster to make it appear more [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Picturesque]].<ref>Garnett, Oliver.

The mining history of the area is also represented by several sections of the [[West Somerset Mineral Railway]] and associated ruins of mine buildings which are now scheduled. The most recent monuments are World War II pillboxes. The village of [[Dunster]] provides the highest concentration of monuments ranging from Iron Age forts to the castle and [[Yarn Market, Dunster|Yarn Market]] which was built around 1600.<ref>{{cite web | title=Yarn Market   | work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=264694 | accessdate=28 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Yarn Market|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1173428|website=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunstertithebarn.org.uk/history-dunster.htm|title=Brief History of Dunster |publisher=Dunster Tithe Barn|accessdate=26 May 2009}}</ref>
