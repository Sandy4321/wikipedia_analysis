'''Benjamin Spooner Briggs''' ([[24 April]] [[1835]] - 1872?) was an experienced [[seaman]] and [[sailer]] of the [[United States]]. He is most famous today for having been the [[captain (nautical)|Captain]] of the [[merchant ship]] ''[[Mary Celeste]]'' when she was discovered, apparently abandoned, drifting in the calm waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the [[Straits of Gibraltar]], on [[4 December]] [[1872]]. The lifeboat was missing yet the ''Mary Celeste'' herself was not anchored and still under full sail, in perfect condition, and there were still signs of very recent habitation on the ship and sudden and unexplained abandonment. Benjamin Briggs, his wife Sarah and two-year-old daughter Sophia Matilda, along with the crew of the ''Mary Celeste'', and the lifeboat, were never found and presumed lost. It is generally considered the greatest maritime mystery of all time.

==Maritime career==
The Briggs family of [[Massachusetts]] had a long [[maritime]] history and Benjamin Briggs himself had spent most of his life at sea, and knew the perils therein well and by all accounts was an experienced, hardy and able seaman. Briggs was also a man who was well respected and admired by those who served under him due to his fairness and ability. He worked his way up the ranks to eventually becoming captain of his own ship, and also captain of numerous ships afterwards. Briggs had previously captained the [[brigantine]] ''Sea Foam'', and in 1862 became captain of the three-masted [[schooner]] ''Forest King''. In 1865, when he took command of the [[Barque|bark]] ''Arthur'', Benjamin gave command of the ''Forest King'' to his brother, Oliver Briggs. Oliver was a frequent buisness partner and sailer with his brother.

==Family==
Benjamin Briggs was a man of outstanding moral character, devoutly religious, and was also a [[Teetotalism|believer in abstinence]]. This caught the attention of his peers in his local community. In 1862, Benjamin Briggs married Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, the daughter of the [[Reverend]] Leander Cobb. Benjamin and Sarah took their [[honeymoon]] in Europe and sailed there in Benjamin's three-masted [[schooner]] ''Forest King''. At some point in 1865 they had a son, Arthur S. Briggs, who was born in the family home at Rose Cottage, [[Marion, Massachusetts]], a town known for its many local sea captains and sailors whose homes were in town, and shipbuilding. The next year, the family travelled to [[Marseilles]], [[France]], and returned in time for their daughter, Sophia Matilda Briggs, to be born on [[31 October]] [[1870]] at Rose Cottage.

==Mary Celeste==
{{main|Mary Celeste}}
In 1871 Benjamin and his brother were considering giving up the sea and buying a [[hardware store]] in [[New Bedford]], but apparently decided against this. In 1872 Benjamin bought a share in the [[brigantine]] ''[[Mary Celeste]]'' owned by James Winchester, formally the ''Amazon'', and made modifications to the cabin to house his family. In late 1872, two-year-old Sarah and his wife Sophia accompanied him on a voyage from [[Staten Island]], [[New York]], to [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], while 7-year-old Arthur was left with his grandmother at Rose Cottage, [[Marion, Massachusetts]], to attend school.

A month later the ship was found famously and inexplicably abandoned in the calm waters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the [[Straits of Gibraltar]]. Briggs, Sophia and Sarah, along with the rest of the crew of the ''Marie Celeste'', were never discovered and their fate remains a mystery. 

==Legacy==
Through his young son Arthur who was left a home with his grandmother at the time of the voyage, Benjamin Briggs has a number of living descendants. <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/netw/200811/programs/ZY8693A001D13112008T203500.htm</ref>

Benjamin Briggs has been mentioned numerous times in [[conspiracy theories]] and fiction regarding the disappearance of the ''Mary Celeste''. One classic example of this is the [[1935 in film|1935]] [[Hammer Film Productions]] ''[[The Mystery of the Marie Celeste]]'', starring [[Bela Lugosi]]. A fictionalized version of Cpt. Benjamin Briggs was also seen in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[Flight Through Eternity]]'' in 1965.

In 1884, only twelve years after the real incident, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the creator of [[Sherlock Holmes]], wrote a fictionalized account of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'' entitled ''[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]].'' One reviewer sought to attribute the story to [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], while critics compared it to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Doyle changed the spelling of the ship from Mary to Marie Celeste. Doyle's fictional story drew heavily on the original incident. Much of this story's fictional content, and the incorrect name, have come to dominate popular accounts of the incident. These include especially numerous things found onboard the vessel which were not. Doyle also put forward the theory that the crew were all murdered by African-American cutthroats bound on a [[racist]] ''[[jihad]]'' against all white men; however there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest this was the case. In fact, the facts of the incident would suggest anything otherwise is more likely.

A cenotaph memorializing the family is found in [[Evergreen Cemetery]], [[Marion, Massachusetts]]. The inscription reads, "Capt. Benj S. Briggs born Apr 24, 1835, Sarah E Cobb his wife born Apr 20 1841, Sophia M, their daughter, then 10 mos, born Oct 31, 1870. Lost in Brig Mary Celeste Nov 1872" <ref>http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSvcid=398&GRid=9731187&</ref>
