The '''thyristor''' is a solid-state [[semiconductor device]] with four layers of alternating [[N-type semiconductor|N]] and [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material. They act as a switch, conducting when their gate receives a current pulse, and continue to conduct for as long as they are forward biased.

Some sources define [[silicon controlled rectifier]]s and thyristors as  synonymous<ref>Christiansen, Donald; Alexander, Charles K. (2005); ''Standard Handbook of Electrical Engineering (5th ed.)''. McGraw-Hill, ISBN 0-07-138421-9</ref>; others define SCRs as a subset of thyristors. Among the latter, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] 60747-6 standard stands out.

Non-SCR thyristors include devices with more than four layers, such as [[triac]]s and [[Distributed Buffer - Gate Turn-off Thyristor (DB-GTO)|DB-GTO]]s<ref> Dorf, Richard C., editor (1997), ''Electrical Engineering Handbook (2nd ed.)''.

==Function==
<center>[[image:thyristor.svg]]</center>

The thyristor is a four-layer semiconducting device, with each layer consisting of an alternately [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labeled anode and cathode, are across the full four layers, and the control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near to the cathode. The operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled [[Bipolar Junction Transistor]]s, arranged to cause the self-latching action.

Thyristors have three states:
# Reverse blocking mode -- Voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode
# Forward blocking mode -- Voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not yet been triggered into conduction
# Forward conducting mode -- The thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the "holding current"

===Function of the gate terminal===
The thyristor has three [[p-n junction]]s (serially named J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub>, J<sub>3</sub> from the anode).
[[Image:Thyristor layers.svg|thumb|230px|right|Layer Diagram of Thyristor]]
When the anode is at a positive potential V<sub>AK</sub> with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J<sub>1</sub> and J<sub>3</sub> are forward biased, while junction J<sub>2</sub> is reverse biased. As J<sub>2</sub> is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if V<sub>AK</sub> is increased beyond the breakdown voltage V<sub>BO</sub> of the thyristor, [[avalanche breakdown]] of J<sub>2</sub> takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).
 
If a positive potential V<sub>G</sub> is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J<sub>2</sub> occurs at a lower value of V<sub>AK</sub>. By selecting an appropriate value of V<sub>G</sub>, the thyristor can be switched into the on state immediately.

It must be noted that V<sub>G</sub> need not be applied after the avalanche breakdown has occurred. Hence V<sub>G</sub> can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a [[UJT]] [[relaxation oscillator]].

These gate pulses are characterized in terms of '''gate trigger voltage''' (V<sub>GT</sub>) and '''gate trigger current''' (I<sub>GT</sub>).  Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate [[electric charge|charge]] required to trigger the thyristor.

===Switching characteristics===
In a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. do not need a '''''continuous''''' supply of gate current to conduct), providing the anode current has exceeded the '''latching current''' (I<sub>L</sub>).  As long as the anode remains '''positively biased''', it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the '''holding current''' (I<sub>H</sub>).
[[Image:Thyristor_char.JPG|thumb|200px|right|V - I Characteristics ]]
A thyristor can be '''switched off''' if the external circuit causes the anode to become '''negatively biased'''.  In some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor.  This method is called '''forced commutation'''.

After a thyristor has been switched off by forced commutation, a finite time delay must have elapsed before  the anode can be positively biased in the off-state.  This minimum delay is called the '''circuit commutated turn off time''' (t<sub>Q</sub>).  Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the thyristor to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers ([[Electron hole|hole]]s and [[electron]]s) that have not yet [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombined]].

For applications with frequencies higher than the domestic AC mains supply (e.g. 50Hz or 60Hz), thyristors with lower values of t<sub>Q</sub> are required.  Such '''fast thyristors''' are made by diffusing into the silicon [[heavy metal]] [[ion]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]] which act as charge combination centres.  Alternatively, fast thyristors may be made by [[neutron]] [[irradiation]] of the silicon.

== History ==
[[1956]] The Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) or Thyristor proposed by [[William Shockley]] in [[1950]] and championed by Moll and others at [[Bell Labs]] was developed first by power engineers at [[General Electric]] (G.E.) led by Gordon Hall and commercialised by G.E.'s Frank W. "Bill" Gutzwiller.

==Applications==

Thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved, and are often used to control [[alternating current]]s, where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to automatically switch off; referred to as [[zero cross circuit|Zero Cross]] operation. The device can be said to operate ''synchronously'' as, once the device is open, it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required to replicate; the device is biased ''fully on''. This is not to be confused with symmetrical operation, as the output is unidirectional, flowing only from cathode to anode, and so is asymmetrical in nature.

Thyristors can be used as the control elements for phase angle triggered controllers, also known as [[phase fired controllers]].

Thyristors can also be found in power supplies for digital circuits, where they can be used as a sort of "circuit breaker" or "crowbar" to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components.  The thyristor is used in conjunction with a zener diode attached to its gate, and when the output voltage of the supply rises above the zener voltage, the thyristor opens, shorting the power supply output to ground (and in general blowing an upstream fuse).

The first large scale application of thyristors, with associated triggering [[diac]], in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color television receivers in the early 1970's. The stabilized high voltage d.c supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the a.c supply input. The precise switching point was determined by the load on the output d.c supply as well fluctuations on the input a.c supply. They proved to be unpopular with the a.c grid power supplier companies because the simultaneous switching of many television receivers, all at approximately the same point in time, introduced asymmetry into the supply waveform and as a consequence injected d.c back into the grid with a tendency towards saturation of transformer cores and overheating. They were largely phased out in this kind of application by the end of the decade. 

===Snubber circuits===
Because thyristors can be triggered on by a high rate of rise of off-state voltage, in many applications this is prevented by connecting a [[resistor]]-[[capacitor]] (RC) [[snubber|snubber circuit]] between the anode and cathode terminals in order to limit the dV/dt.

==Comparisons to other devices==
[[Image:SCR1369.jpg|thumb|200px|right|SCR rated about 100 amperes, 1200 volts]]
The functional drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, called a [[TRIAC]], is able to work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, [[reactance|reactive]] loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the [[Alternating current|ac]] power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily-[[inductance|inductive]] motor loads usually requires the use of a "[[snubber]]" circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. [[Antiparallel|Inverse parallel]] SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off.

An earlier [[gas filled tube]] device called a [[Thyratron]] provided a similar electronic switching capability, where a small control voltage could switch a large current. It is from a combination of "thyratron" and "[[transistor]]" that the term "thyristor" is derived.

Modern thyristors can switch large amounts of power (up to megawatts). In the realm of [[HVDC|very high power applications]], they are still the primary choice. However, in low and medium power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) they have almost been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like [[Power MOSFET|MOSFET]]s or [[IGBT]]s. One major problem associated with SCRs is that they are not fully controllable switches. The [[GTO (Thyristor)|GTO]] '''(Gate Turn-off Thyristor)''' and [[IGCT|IGCT]] are two related devices which address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to large switching times arising from '''bipolar conduction'''. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their '''unipolar conduction''' (only [[majority carriers]] carry the current).

==Failure modes==
As well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage, current or power ratings, thyristors have their own particular modes of failure, including:
* '''Turn on di/dt''' &mdash; in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area (SCRs & triacs).
* '''Forced commutation''' &mdash; in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction (SCRs only).

== Silicon carbide thyristors ==
In recent years, some manufacturers<ref>Example: [http://powerelectronics.com/news/silicon-carbide-inverter/ ''Silicon Carbide Inverter Demonstrates Higher Power Output''] in Power Electronics Technology (2006-02-01)</ref> have developed thyristors using [[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) as the semiconductor material.  These have applications in high temperature environments, being capable of operating at temperatures up to 350 <U+00B0>C.
