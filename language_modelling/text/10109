{{nihongo|'''''Sonic X'''''|<U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X|Sonikku Ekkusu}} is a Japanese [[anime]] series created by [[TMS Entertainment]], based on the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' video game series published by [[Sega]]. It initially ran for fifty-two episodes, which were broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004; however, a further twenty-six were aired elsewhere from 2005 to 2006. The show's American localization and broadcasting was handled by [[4Kids]] until 2012, when [[Saban Brands]] got the rights to the series.

The plot follows a group of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animal friends originating in the games<U+2014>such as [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose]], and [[Cream the Rabbit]]<U+2014>and a human boy named Christopher Thorndyke whom they meet after warping from their home planet to Earth. While on Earth, they repeatedly scuffle with antagonist [[Doctor Eggman]] and his robots over control of the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]], while also adjusting to their recognition as celebrities. The final story arc sees the friends return to their world with Chris, where they<U+2014>along with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo<U+2014>enter outer space and fight an army of giant robots called the Metarex.

''Sonic X'' has received mixed reviews. Generally, writers have criticized its English-language localization and incorporation of some of the characters, while being more generous toward various other aspects. However, it was very popular in the United States, though less so in Japan. The series was merchandised into an [[edutainment]] video game for the [[Leapster]], a [[trading card game]], a [[comic book]] series, and various toys and other items. The phrase "gotta go fast"<U+2014>a reference to the show's North American theme song<U+2014>has survived as a ''Sonic'' catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Sonic X episodes|List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|Sonic Adventure|Sonic Adventure 2|Sonic Battle}}
While [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] attempts to destroy the base of [[Doctor Eggman]] and retrieve the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]], one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the "Chaos Control" technique and warps Sonic, Eggman, and some of Sonic's other [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animal friends<U+2014>[[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Amy Rose]], [[Cream the Rabbit]] (with Cheese the [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]]), Cream's mother [[Vanilla the Rabbit|Vanilla]], [[Big the Cat]] (with Froggy), [[Rouge the Bat]], and [[Knuckles the Echidna]]<U+2014>to [[Earth]], the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel-universe]] version of their world. Police officers see him and chase him until he escapes, but he falls into a mansion's swimming pool and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there. Chris lives with his movie star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka, and tries to hide the animal characters from them for some time; however, Cream accidentally reveals them all, and they build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.

Despite their warm relationships with the humans, the animals want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Eggman, his robot assistants<U+2014>the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe<U+2014>and his larger, armed robots. Eggman makes plans to take over the world, which catches the attention of the unnamed nation's President. At first only Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop Eggman, but the other animals soon join the crusade, and when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes. However, this does not stop Eggman, with whom they continue to scuffle for Emeralds.

Eggman awakens a mutated Chao named Chaos, who shatters the Master Emerald, a large gemstone that Knuckles' tribe guarded for millennia. Knuckles recollects shards of the Master Emerald while the other animals fight an extended losing battle against Chaos to get the Chaos Emeralds back. When it absorbs all seven, it reaches a form called Perfect Chaos and discards the Emeralds, which are now useless to it. With the help of a girl from the past named [[Tikal the Echidna|Tikal]], Sonic makes use of the Emeralds to attain his [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|Super Sonic]] form and defeat Chaos, who becomes placid and returns to sleep.

Shortly, Eggman finds his grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]'s diary and finds Gerald's old project [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]] in a military base. He releases Shadow from his cryogenic capsule; Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald and is mistaken for Sonic, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues Sonic, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the space colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if the planet does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the [[Moon]] to prove his power. Eggman collects all seven Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program set up many years ago by Gerald, which will destroy Earth in hours. Everyone works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic to humanity. However, Chris convinces Shadow to save the Earth, so Shadow and Sonic power up using the Emeralds, defeat a long-dormant creature called the Biolizard, and reroute the ARK away from Earth. This seemingly kills Shadow, and he is mourned.

The Moon remains wrecked and Eggman rebuilds it, citing remorse for his misdeeds. However, its position shifts, creating a [[solar eclipse]], and Eggman manufactures "Sunshine Balls" to replicate sunlight and sells them. Sonic sees through his motivations and deactivates the Balls, and Eggman is arrested. Bokkun activates a robot named [[Sonic Battle|Emerl]], who quickly allies with the animals, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous characters of both alignments, but it goes berserk and begins to destroy the city. Cream and Cheese destroy Emerl, tearing up at the loss of their friend.

Later, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that the animals' world and Earth were once a single world split into two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly. Chris blames Eggman, so he finds him and accuses him, but Eggman claims he is innocent and also wants to revert the process. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport the animals back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris realizes he does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all of the animals but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide. Sonic is understanding, and Chris is eventually found by his parents, who promise to spend more time on him; with Chris' approval, Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds.

Six months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but Sonic scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile on Earth, where [[time dilation|six ''years'' have passed]] and Chris is now 18, Chris builds another device to return to the animals' world and regroup with his friends; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them. They board Tails' new airship, the Blue Typhoon, scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and "Planet Eggs" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy), and fight the Metarex at every turn. Eggman joins the Metarex shortly after. Along the way, the animals meet their old friends the [[Chaotix]], and Tails and Cosmo fall in love. Later, Rouge finds Shadow alive but hibernating in a capsule on Eggman's ship; she releases him and at one point he saves Chris from the Metarex before disappearing.

Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo for an unknown reason, so Tails protects her. Shadow knocks him aside and is about to do it when Dark Oak, the leader of the Metarex, appears. He reveals that they are related to Cosmo and that Cosmo has been an unwitting spy for them ever since they subversively implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of her species; this was Shadow's rationale, but Shadow is banished from the ship. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that the device is connected to the area of her brain responsible for sight and hearing and that removing it will likely void those senses forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway, but Tails refuses, and they all continue their ongoing battle.

The Chaotix and Shadow meet up and, with the other animals, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet made of water and containing a Planet Egg. Sonic is catapulted into it, where he drowns until Amy and Chris rescue him. The planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that they know they have lost the battle for the Emeralds, so they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. Cosmo sees a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] from her mother Galaxina, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She accepts this role, fusing with the giant seed and instructing Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed and destroy them. Eggman pressures Tails to do it, so he does, in tears the whole time. The Metarex are annihilated, but Tails grieves for Cosmo. Back on the animals' world, Sonic and Shadow reappear and solemnly inform Tails that they could not revive Cosmo and only found one of her seeds, but Cream and Amy try to cheer him up. With an ephemeral change of heart, Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, but promptly reverts to his old ways after Chris leaves. The series ends by showing Cosmo's seed sprouting.

===Creation and development===
[[File:Sonic X scene.png|thumb|left|This scene shows (clockwise from top left) Sonic, Tails, and two original major characters<U+2014>Cosmo and Chris<U+2014>in the typical outer-space setting.]]
The show was created by [[TMS Entertainment]].<ref name="credits"/> Most of the series consists of original content with numerous original characters in addition to established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of ''[[Sonic Adventure]] 1'' and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2|2]]''. While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined [[CGI animation|CGI]] elements for things such as Sonic's homing attack.<ref name="them"/> [[Yuji Naka]], then the head of [[Sonic Team]], filled in as executive producer, and [[Yuji Uekawa]] created all of the original characters.<ref name="credits"/>

===Airing and localization===
The episodes were [[Editing of anime in American distribution|heavily edited for content and length]], as [[4Kids]] is infamous among anime fans for doing. 4Kids removed all instances of alcohol consumption and coarse language, instances of breaking the [[fourth wall]], and numerous romantic scenes.<ref name="negativity"/> However, unlike in some other series 4Kids translated around the early- to mid-2000s, such as ''[[Kirby: Right Back at Ya!]]'', no full episodes were cut from ''Sonic X''. Producer Michael Haigney personally disliked realistic violence in children's programs, but had not intended to make massive changes himself. Instead, he was bound by [[Fox Broadcasting Corporation]]'s strict guidelines, which forbid content such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and strong violence. In 2006, near the end of the show's American production, Haigney stated in an interview that he had never played a ''Sonic'' game, read the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comics]], or watched any of the previous ''Sonic'' animated series.<ref name="producer">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070217075303/http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-articles/80|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-articles/80|publisher=Anime Boredom|title=mr. michael haigney interview (4kids)|date=February 12, 2006|last=Rasmussen|first=David|accessdate=April 30, 2014|archivedate=February 17, 2007}}</ref>

[[Archie Comics]], publisher of the main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics, started a ''Sonic X'' series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released in December 2008, and it kicked off the ''[[Sonic Universe]]'' arc of the comics. The comics were written by [[Ian Flynn]], who also authors the main ''Sonic'' comics.<ref name="last">{{cite comic|title=Sonic X|publisher=[[Archie Comics]]|issue=40|date=December 2008|page=p. 26}}</ref>

===Video games===
In 2003, [[McDonald's]] packaged five different single-button [[dedicated console]] games, mostly based on various sports, with [[Happy Meal]]s to promote ''Sonic X'': two featuring Sonic and one each for Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow. Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesasylum.com/2013/04/17/gaming-happy-meals-a-grease-covered-history/|publisher=Games Asylum|last=Gander|first=Matt (of [[Retro Gamer]])|date=April 17, 2013|title=The history of fast-food freebies|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

[[LeapFrog Enterprises]] released a ''Sonic X'' [[edutainment|educational]] math game for its [[Leapster]] handheld game console; it was released in 2005 in North America<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, North American) boxart.</ref> and 2007 in Europe.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster, European) boxart.</ref> The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced [[platform game|platform]]/[[action game|action]] game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction).<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 2<U+2013>3.</ref> There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.<ref>''Sonic X'' (Leapster) instruction manual, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref>

===Trading card game===
[[Score Entertainment]] created a ''Sonic X'' [[collectible card game]] for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with ''Sonic'' characters than like a wholly ''Sonic''-based product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/6039-sonic-x-card-game-review|publisher=KidzWorld|title=Sonic X Card Game Review|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

==Reception and popularity==
''Sonic X'' has had a middling reception; Conrad Zimmerman of [[Destructoid]] cited its "horrible localization" as a main reason for negativity.<ref name="negativity">{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/watch-sonic-x-on-hulu-this-easter-169872.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=April 4, 2010|accessdate=April 6, 2014|title=Watch Sonic X on Hulu This Easter|last=Zimmerman|first=Conrad}}</ref> [[Famitsu]] offered a uniformly positive review before the first episode broadcast in 2003, commending the skillful transition of the games' speed and style to animation, as well as the deep story, and expected the series to continue to grow more interesting.<ref name="famguy1">{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1139336_1124.html|publisher=[[Famitsu]]|title=<U+30A2><U+30CB><U+30E1><U+300E><U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X<U+300F><U+306E><U+5236><U+4F5C><U+767A><U+8868><U+4F1A><U+304C><U+958B><U+50AC><U+FF01>|date=March 18, 2003|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Another Famitsu review from later in the year called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1140433_1124.html|publisher=Famitsu|title=<U+300E><U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF> X<U+300F><U+30A2><U+30D5><U+30EC><U+30B3><U+73FE><U+5834><U+3092><U+6F5C><U+5165><U+53D6><U+6750><U+FF01>|date=June 19, 2003|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> In contrast, Tim Jones of ''THEM Anime'' gave ''Sonic X'' a mostly negative two-star review, calling it "mediocre". He praised the show's music, backgrounds, and first episode in general, but derided the use of "annoying" characters like Chris and Amy, Sonic's bland characterization, the use of CGI for Sonic's homing attack, and the English voice acting.<ref name="them">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=355|publisher=''ThemAnime''|last=Jones|first=Tim|title=Sonic X|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]] praised its closeness to the formula of the ''Sonic'' games and the theme song, but criticized its characters, in particular the addition of humans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-absolute-worst-sonic-moments/?page=2|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|author=GamesRadar_US|date=June 23, 2012|title=The absolute worst Sonic moments|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}</ref> While giving no further comments, [[Allgame]] gave the Game Boy Advance Videos of episodes 1<U+2013>2 and 3<U+2013>4 each two and a half stars of five.<ref name="game1">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=45249&tab=overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|author=All Game Guide|title=Game Boy Advance Video: Sonic X, Vol. 1|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref><ref name="game2"/> [[Common Sense Media]] gave it three stars for quality, also assessing its appropriateness for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/sonic-x|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|title=Common Sense Media says: Hedgehog and human join together to battle evil.|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

They allowed Christer to write it himself but did not send it until he badgered them further, and the king responded that he could not approve the change because Christer was not 18 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/six-year-old-boy-asks-king-to-change-his-name-to-sonic-x-129705.phtml|publisher=Destructoid|date=April 23, 2009|last=Sterling|first=Jim|title=Six-year-old boy asks King to change his name to Sonic X|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5227434/king-denies-little-boys-wish-to-be-named-sonic-x|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|last=Good|first=Owen|title=King Denies Little Boy's Wish to Be Named 'Sonic X'|date=April 25, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref> Extending over a decade past the show's initial release, the phrase "gotta go fast" has been used in the titles of video game periodical articles to represent the ''Sonic'' series<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/sonic-s-gotta-go-fast-in-these-smash-4-screens-262785.phtml|publisher=Destructoid|title=Sonic's gotta go fast in these Smash 4 screens|last=Ponce|first=Tony|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/04/26/sonic-the-hedgehogs-gotta-go-fast-on-oculus-rift/|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|last=Prell|first=Sam|title=Sonic The Hedgehog's gotta go fast on Oculus Rift|accessdate=June 22, 2014|date=April 26, 2014}}</ref> and [[speedrun]]ning in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegamingdaily.com/2013/02/19/gotta-go-fast-speedrunnings-incredible-growth-in-popularity/|publisher=InsideGamingDaily|date=February 19, 2013|last=Sonntag|first=Lawrence|accessdate=June 22, 2014|title=Gotta Go Fast: Speedrunning<U+2019>s Incredible Growth in Popularity}}</ref>
