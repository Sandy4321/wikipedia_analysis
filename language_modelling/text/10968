==World War I==
Craig transferred to the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and was posted to [[No. 204 Squadron RAF|4 Naval Squadron]] as a [[Sopwith Camel]] pilot in May 1918. He scored his first aerial victories over German fighter planes on 15 August 1918, and in just over a month, ran his total to eight, all against fighters. On 26 September 1918, two days after his final victory, he was [[killed in action]] off-shore of [[Blankenberge]], Belgium. He was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] on 5 October 1918,<ref>''Above the Trenches'', p. 124.</ref> though it would not be [[gazetted]] until 1 November 1918, ten days before war's end:<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 1 November 1918, pp. 12961, 12964. http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30989/supplements/12961; http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30989/supplements/12964 Retrieved 2 December 2011.</ref>

:Whilst acting temporarily as flight leader on one day last month he personally destroyed three enemy machines, and the remainder of his flight accounted for three more. Lt. Craig has been engaged in numerous air battles, and always displays fine spirit, ability and determination in carrying out his duties. He has personally brought down two enemy machines completely out of control, in addition to those referred to above.<ref>''Supplement to the London Gazette'', 1 November 1918, pp. 12961, 12964. http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30989/supplements/12961; http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/30989/supplements/12964 Retrieved 2 December 2011.</ref>
