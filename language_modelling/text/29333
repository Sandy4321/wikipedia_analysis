'''Mary Jane Rathbun''' (December 22, 1922 - April 10, 1999), popularly known as '''Brownie Mary''', was a notable member of the American [[medical cannabis]] movement.  Rathbun was a [[hospital volunteer]] in the [[AIDS]] ward of [[San Francisco General Hospital]] who became known for illegally baking and distributing chocolate [[Cannabis foods|cannabis]] [[brownies]] to AIDS patients.<ref>Gumbel 1999</ref>  Along with [[Dennis Peron]], Rathbun was active in efforts to legalize cannabis use for people with AIDS, [[cancer]], [[glaucoma]], and other diseases.<ref name="Goldberg">Goldberg 1996.</ref>

Brownie Mary was arrested for baking cannabis brownies on three separate occasions, with each arrest bringing increased local, national and international media attention to her cause.<ref name="Saxon">Saxon 1999.</ref>  Her grandmotherly appearance brought her public sympathy and worked against attempts by the district attorney's office to prosecute her for possession.  The City of San Francisco eventually gave her permission to distribute cannabis brownies to people with AIDS.<ref>Goldberg 1993.</ref>

She worked on Proposition P and [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|California Proposition 215]] and helped contribute to the establishment of the San Francisco [[Cannabis Buyers Club]], a medical cannabis dispensary.  When the Club moved from its original location on Church Street to a five-story building on Market Street in the mid 1990s, the new location became known as the "Brownie Mary Building."  The publicity Brownie Mary generated for the medical cannabis movement  motivated medical researchers to pursue new human studies into the therapeutic use of cannabis for the first time in decades and contributed to renewed interest in using [[cannabinoid]]s to treat anorexia and weight loss in HIV-infected patients.<ref>Werner 2001, pp. 26-28; Abrams 2002; See "[http://jcp.sagepub.com/content/42/11_suppl/82S.short Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial]" (2002). ''J Clin Pharmacol''; Russell 2003: "Abrams' own scientific studies of medical marijuana were inspired by Mary Jane Rathburn, better known as "Brownie Mary," who supplied patients at the hospital and in the daytime clinic with pot-laced sweets."</ref>

==Early life==
Brownie Mary was born Mary Jane Rathbun in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] on 
December 22, 1921.<ref name="Pimsleur">Pimsleur 1999, p. A19.</ref> She was named "Mary Jane" by her mother, a conservative Irish Catholic.  "Given my background and reputation and my adopted name, my poor old mother is surely turning cartwheels in her grave", Rathbun later recalled.<ref name="Hatfield99">Hatfield 1999.</ref>

Rathbun attended Catholic school, and at the age of 13 she was involved in an altercation with a nun who caned her; Rathbun fought back.<ref name="Goldberg"/>  She moved out of her home and found a job as a waitress.  As a teenager, she traveled from Chicago to Wisconsin with a group that fought for miners rights to unionize.  Back in Minneapolis in the late 1940s, she worked as an activist on abortion rights for women.<ref name="Hatfield99"/>

==San Francisco==
[[File:Cafe Flore Christmas 2009.jpg|thumb|Cafe Flore.  Rathbun and Peron first met here in the early 1970s.]]
During World War II, she moved to San Francisco, California, and met a man at a USO dance; they married but soon divorced.  Rathbun had a daughter, Peggy, in 1955, and worked as a waitress for most of her adult life.  She moved out to Reno, Nevada, but after Peggy died in a car accident in the early 1970s, she moved back to San Francisco.

In 1974, Rathbun first met Dennis Peron in the Castro district at [[Caf<U+00E9> Flore]] where they shared a [[Joint (cannabis)|cannabis cigarette]] together.  During that time, Rathbun was working as a waitress at the [[International House of Pancakes]].  For extra money, she would sell cannabis-laced brownies, and she became known in the Castro for selling "magical brownies" out of a basket for several dollars each.<ref name="Woo"/>  Peron would also sell Rathbun's brownies on Castro Street at his Big Top pot supermarket.<ref>Rathbun & Peron 1996.</ref>  Police raided Peron's business in 1977 and shot him in the leg.<ref>Zane 1996, p. A13.</ref>

==Arrests==
Rathbun was arrested for baking cannabis brownies three times, in 1981, 1982, and in 1992.  [[Associated Press]], [[United Press International]], [[Reuters]], and [[CNN]] distributed stories about her arrests around the world, and brought her campaign to a wide audience, turning her grandmotherly visage into the public face of the medical cannabis movement in the early 1990s and winning the movement a great deal of support and sympathy.  Her publicized arrests contributed to the momentum behind public support for Proposition P and California Proposition 215.<ref name="Warren99">Warren 1999; Reuters 1999.</ref>

In the early 1980s, Rathbun advertised "original recipe brownies" on San Francisco bulletin boards that were "magically delicious".  On the night of January 14, 1981, the police raided Rathbun's home and found more than 18  pounds of cannabis, 54 dozen cannabis brownies, and an assortment of other drugs.  When Rathbun opened the door, she reportedly told the police, "I thought you guys were coming."  She was 57 years old when she was first arrested.<ref>Associated Press, United Press International</ref>

She was arrested in [[Sonoma County]] on July 21, 1992, while pouring two pounds of cannabis into brownie batter at the home of a grower.  She was charged with possession of 2.5 pounds of cannabis and released on bail.  The Sonoma County district attorney's office attempted to prosecute her, bringing her case media coverage.

In 1984, Brownie Mary began volunteering each Thursday in the AIDS ward (Ward 86) at [[San Francisco General Hospital]].<ref name="Gorman93">Gorman 1993; Woo 1999.</ref>

==ACT-UP==
In New York in the early 1990s, cannabis activist Dennis Peron spoke at a meeting of the [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT-UP) about the alleged benefits of cannabis for the relief of AIDS symptoms.  Few believed or wanted to listen to him.  Nevertheless, Peron persisted, and several years later he introduced the group to Rathbun.  She spoke to the group about her first-hand experience distributing cannabis-laced brownies to people with AIDS.  [[Peter Gorman]] reported that this time, "the reception was warmer, but still skeptical".<ref>Gorman 1994</ref>

In September 1992, Rathbun joined  ACT UP/DC in Washington, D.C. for a protest against the medical cannabis policies of the U.S. government.  They delivered a letter to [[James O. Mason]], then director of the [[United States Public Health Service]], requesting that people with AIDS receive immediate access to cannabis.  In 1991, Mason had been responsible for cancelling the compassionate use program that allowed patients to use cannabis.  He had also expressed controversial comments about the program, claiming, among other things, that people with AIDS who used cannabis "might be less likely to practice safe...sexual behavior."  In response, ACT UP/DC asked Mason to resign his post if he failed to meet their demands to restore access to cannabis.<ref name="AW92">AIDS Weekly 1992, p. 9.</ref>

Brownies were served at the protest in honor of Rathbun, who had been previously arrested in March 1992 and was now facing felony possession charges for distributing cannabis brownies to AIDS patients.  Outside the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]], Rathbun invited Mason to "follow me around for two days as I visit my kids in the wards, and then see where he stands on this".<ref name="AW92"/>

==Personal life==
Brownie Mary worked as a waitress for much of her life.   She used cannabis to ease the arthritis pain in her knees.<ref name="Hatfield99"/>  Philosophically, she considered herself an anarchist and an [[atheist]].  She did not have any grandchildren.

==Death==
Brownie Mary had been suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis for some time before her death.<ref name="Goldberg"/> She also had artificial knees and she was a survivor of colon cancer.<ref name="Woo">Woo 1999.</ref>  By the spring of 1996, she was experiencing extreme pain and was no longer able to bake, and began losing weight.  She told Dennis Peron that she was considering traveling to Michigan for [[physician-assisted suicide]] at the hands of [[Jack Kevorkian]].<ref name="Goldberg"/>  

In August 1998, she fell at her house and was admitted to Mount Zion Hospital for surgery on her neck and spine.<ref name="Pimsleur"/>  She spent time at [[Davies Medical Center]] recovering from the operation with few visitors.<ref name="Ostler">Ostler 1998, p. A3.</ref>  Later, she was confined to a bed at Laguna Honda Hospital, a nursing home for the poor.<ref name="Pimsleur"/>  Brownie Mary died of a heart attack at age 77 on April 10, 1999.<!--The cause of death was listed as bronchopneumonia. NOT VERIFIED-->  On April 17, a candlelight vigil was held in her honor in the Castro, with 300 people in attendance, including her friend, district attorney [[Terence Hallinan]].<ref>Costantinou 1999.</ref>

Brownie Mary's ashes were reportedly stolen from a private home in 2004.<ref>Garchik 2004, p. E-22.</ref>

==Awards==
In 1986,  SFGH's Ward 86 honored Brownie Mary with a "Volunteer of The Year" award.  In 1992, the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] declared August 25 "Brownie Mary Day":  
<blockquote>
Resolution declaring August 25, 1992 "Brownie Mary Day" in San Francisco honoring Mary Rathbun for her long and compassionate services at San Francisco General Hospital Ward 86. (Supervisors Hallinan, Alioto)<ref>Board of Supervisors, City and County of San Francisco, p. 869.  See also: Goldberg 1996; Werner 2001.</ref>
</blockquote>

She was named a "Living Saint" in 1994 at the San Francisco Saints Alive Benefit.  In 1996, she was Grand Marshal of the [[San Francisco Gay Pride Parade]].  The [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] named her a saint in 1997. Mary was also included in the Sisters' [[Nuns of the Above]] [[NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt|AIDS Memorial Quilt]] for her work with and advocating for [[people with AIDS]].
