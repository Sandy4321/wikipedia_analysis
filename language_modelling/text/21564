'''Operation Windsor''' was a Canadian offensive launched as part of the [[operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] during [[World War II]]. Taking place between 4&ndash;5 July 1944, the attack was undertaken by the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]] in an attempt to capture the Norman town of [[Carpiquet]] and the adjacent airfield from German forces. The attack was originally intended to take place during the later stages of [[Operation Epsom]], as a means of protecting the eastern flank of the main assault.<ref name="Stacey150">Stacey, p. 150</ref> It was postponed and launched the following week.

On 4 July 1944, four battalions of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked Carpiquet in conjunction with flanking attacks by armoured regiments of the [[2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade]]. Although the [[8th Canadian Infantry Brigade]] succeeded in capturing Carpiquet by mid-afternoon, heavy resistance to the south prevented the airfield from being captured&mdash;despite significant Allied armour and air support. The following day, Canadian forces defeated multiple German counterattacks and succeeded in holding Carpiquet in preparation for British attacks on Caen as part of [[Operation Charnwood]].

==Background==
The historic Norman town of [[Caen]] was a major [[Operation Overlord]] goal for the [[British Second Army]] [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]], having landed forces on two [[Normandy]] beaches on 6 June 1944 in order to capture the city and Carpiquet area.<ref name=vandervat112>Van Der Vat, p. 112</ref><ref>Ellis, pp. 170&mdash;171</ref> Although Caen was the initial objective of British forces landing on [[Sword Beach]], heavy German resistance prevented the town from being captured on 6 June 1944;<ref>Van Der Vat, p. 114</ref> an outcome that had been considered a possibility by Second Army's commanding officer.<ref>Buckley (2004), p. 23</ref> Throughout the next three weeks, positional warfare ensued&mdash;with both sides attacking and counterattacking for minor tactical advantage across the Anglo-Canadian front.<ref>Roy, pp. 42&ndash;43</ref>

From 26&ndash;30 June the Second Army launched [[Operation Epsom]], utilising the newly arrived [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] and was designed to outflank Caen and seize the high ground near [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]], south of the town.<ref name="Clark3132">Clark, pp. 31&ndash;32</ref> By the end of the action VIII Corps had succeeded in advancing six miles through strongly entrenched positions,<ref name="Jackson57">Jackson, p. 57</ref> however the Germans were able to contain the offensive, after committing their last available reserves.<ref name="Hart108">Hart, p. 108</ref> Depending on the success of VIII Corps, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by the [[2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade]], was to capture the village and airfield of Carpiquet in an attack codenamed Operation Ottawa;<ref name="Stacey150"/> however the operation was postponed.<ref>Jackson, p. 60</ref>

Despite the penetrations to the west of Caen, forces of the [[I SS Panzer Corps]] still held positions north and west of Caen. Strong fortifications on the [[River Orne]] and near Carpiquet prevented any further advance toward Caen from the north.<ref name=roy45>Roy, p. 45</ref> Carpiquet, {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} northwest of the centre of Caen, became a major objective of the [[3rd Canadian Infantry Division]], under the command of Major-General [[Rod Keller]]. The need for additional airfields on the Normandy mainland ensured Carpiquet was a valuable prize for the Allies and a heavily-defended position for the Germans.<ref name=roy45/>

==Plan==
===German defences===
The German defences in and around Carpiquet were formidable, as the position was considered "strategically vital" by both sides.<ref name=roy46>Roy, p. 46</ref> The defences at Carpiquet airfield relied on a {{convert|1.2|mi|km}} expanse of level ground, which offered the perfect "killing field" for the defenders.<ref name=roy46/> The airfield had been converted into a defensive fortress,<ref>Van Der Vat, p. 139</ref> employing [[minefield]]s, [[field gun]] and [[machine-gun]] emplacements manned by the I Battalion, SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 26, a flak battery and supported by 15 tanks.<ref name=roy46/><ref>{{cite web|title=history.com|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-12th-ss-hitlerjugend-panzer-division-fought-in-normandy.htm|accessdate=2009-02-10}}</ref>

===Allied forces===
For the attack on Carpiquet, Keller selected the three Infantry Battalions of the [[8th Canadian Infantry Brigade]]&mdash; [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]] (QRC), [[Le R<U+00E9>giment de la Chaudi<U+00E8>re]], and [[The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment]]. Also included were [[The Royal Winnipeg Rifles]] (RWR) from the [[7th Canadian Infantry Brigade]], who would lead the assault.<ref name=roy46/> Armoured and machine-gun support was to be provided by [[The Fort Garry Horse|10th Canadian Armoured Regiment (The Fort Gary Horse)]], [[Sherbrooke Hussars|The Sherbrooke Fusiliers]] and the [[The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada|Cameron Highlanders Support Battalion]]. Additional support was later made available in the form of two squadrons of anti-tank [[Hawker Typhoon]] aircraft and three squadrons of [[Hobart's Funnies|specialized tanks]] from the [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 79th Armoured Division]].<ref name=roy46/> As a means of adding heavy-calibre firepower to the initial bombardment, the 16&nbsp;inch (41&nbsp;cm) guns of the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}} would bombard German positions around Carpiquet, some {{convert|15|mi|km}} inland.

Operation Windsor was designed to commence at 05:00 on 4 July&mdash;following a bombardment by 21 artillery regiments<ref name=copp98>Copp, p. 98</ref>&mdash; with Le R<U+00E9>giment de la Chaudi<U+00E8>re and The North Shore Regiment attacking Carpiquet while the Sherbrooke Fusiliers protected their northern flank.<ref name=roy46/> To the south, The RWR would advance and seize the hangars of Carpiquet airfield.<ref name=copp99>Copp, p. 99</ref> Once the two regiments had captured Carpiquet, the QWR would push through and take control of the airfield's control buildings.<ref name=roy46/> Its capture would enable further Anglo-Canadian attacks against Caen itself.<ref name=vandervat150>Van Der Vat, p. 150</ref>

==Battle==
===Canadian assault on Carpiquet, 4 July===
As dawn broke on 4 July 1944, 21 artillery regiments opened fire on German positions in and around Carpiquet, laying down a creeping barrage {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|400|yards|m}} deep.<ref name=roy47>Roy, p. 47</ref> At 05:00, two Canadian infantry regiments advanced on Carpiquet, while the Sherbrooke Fusiliers attacked to the north.<ref name=copp98/> The Sherbooke Fusiliers attack succeeded in breaking through the German minefields, but the defensive positions of the SS Panzergrenadier Regiment 26 remained intact and continued to fire on advancing infantry of The North Shore Regiment.<ref name=copp98/> In the centre, the Chaudi<U+00E8>res avoided much of the fire directed at The North Shore Regiment as they advanced on Carpiquet.<ref name=copp100>Copp, p. 100</ref> By 06:32, both regiments had reached the outskirts of the town, coming into contact with elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division.<ref name=roy47/> As fighting in Carpiquet degenerated into a house-to-house battle of attrition, tanks of the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment assisted the infantry in gradually overcoming  German opposition.<ref name=roy48>Roy, p. 48</ref>

To the south, the RWR advanced slowly towards the airfield, with German mortar fire inflicting heavy casualties on advancing infantry and armour alike.<ref name=copp100/> It would take the RWR 90 minutes to advance the {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} between Marcelet and the airfield hangars.<ref name=roy48/> Only with eventual indirect fire support from an available squadron of the 10th Armoured Regiment was the RWR able to advance to the airfield.<ref name=roy48/><ref name=copp100/> Several Sherman tanks were knocked out; by midday the RWR were forced to withdraw halfway toward their original positions.<ref name=roy48/>

Unaware that the RWR had failed to gain control of the airfield, Keller elected to commit the QRC to the second phase of the assault plan. The regiment moved forward into Carpiquet&mdash;now controlled by the Chaudi<U+00E8>res and The North Shore who attacked German strongpoints bypassed by the initial assault.<ref name=roy49>Roy, p. 49</ref> It took a combination of infantry attacks, flame-throwers, petard-tanks (Churchill tanks mounted with a 290mm Spigot Mortar), and the immolation of one strongpoint to force the remaining 12 defenders to surrender, with the remainder surrendering after vicious fighting.<ref name=roy49/> The QRC reached the edge of Carpiquet as the RWR was withdrawing, and was ordered to hold their positions until the RWR could reorganize for a second attack.<ref name=copp100/>

For the second attack on the airfield, Keller secured the assistance of two squadrons of Hawker Typhoon antitank fighter-bombers to support the attacks against 12th SS positions.<ref name=roy49/> The survivors of the RWR were ordered to "execute a sweeping attack by the lower ground around the enemy's left flank",<ref name=copp100/> with full armour and artillery support. In the late afternoon, the RWR resumed the attack on the airfield. Although they reached the hangars, they were unable to dislodge the German defenders.<ref name=roy49/> Facing strong counter-attacks by Panzer units,<ref name=copp100/> the RWR was ordered to withdraw to their start-line under the cover of darkness.<ref name=roy49/> In Carpiquet, three battalions of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade rapidly fortified their positions. Following their seizure of the town, the 8th Brigade was now positioned closer to Caen than any other Anglo-Canadian unit.<ref name=roy50>Roy, p. 50</ref> Although the Canadians had firm control of Carpiquet and the northern hangars, the southern hangars and control buildings remained in German hands.<ref name=roy50/>

===German counterattacks, 5 July===
Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} away from the outskirts of Caen, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade posed a significant threat to German positions in the town.<ref name=roy50/> With most of the defence concentrated north of Caen and by the River Odon, it was feared that Anglo-Canadian forces could attack from Carpiquet and bypass the majority of the defences.<ref name=roy50/> Despite growing misgivings about the success of a counterattack, [[Kurt Meyer (soldier)|Kurt Meyer]], the German commander, ordered the soldiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division to retake Carpiquet from the Canadians.<ref name=copp100/> SS forces prepared to counterattack at Carpiquet from Francqueville with armour, artillery, mortars and infantry.<ref name=roy50/>

Shortly after midnight, the first of the SS counterattacks began, throwing itself against the Canadian defences. Although 13 tanks had been lost the previous day,<ref name=roy50/> the remainder of the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment, supported by mortars from the Cameron Highlanders, prevented German panzers from penetrating the ruins of Carpiquet.<ref name=roy50/> Strong Canadian defensive positions and machine-gun fire caused heavy German casualties. By dawn, almost no ground had been gained by the attackers. By midday, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade and 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment had defeated three counterattacks with artillery and Hawker Typhoon assistance, ensuring that German forces could not breach the Canadian positions.<ref name=copp100/> The town remained under Canadian control, even though German [[Nebelwerfer|Nebelwerfer Rocket-Artillery]] and mortars continued to bombard Carpiquet.<ref name=roy50/>

==Aftermath==
Three days after Operation Windsor ended, full-scale attacks on Caen were renewed, with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division taking part in [[Operation Charnwood]]. On 9 July, the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade succeeded in capturing Carpiquet airfield,<ref name=vandervat150/> as 450 aircraft of the [[Royal Air Force]] bombed the town in preparation for a full assault. By 11 July, the northern half of Caen had been seized by British forces, the remainder of the town had been leveled.<ref>Van Der Vat, p. 151</ref> On 18 July British and Canadian forces launched operations [[Operation Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Operation Goodwood|Goodwood]]; the Canadians launched the former operation liberating the remainder of Caen while British forces secured the terrain to the east and south of the city.<ref>Stacey, p. 169</ref><ref>Trew, p. 48</ref> Canadian forces then attacked German positions on [[Battle of Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge|Verri<U+00E8>res Ridge]].<ref>Van Der Vat, p. 157</ref>

Canadian casualties for the operation totaled 377,<ref name=copp100/> of which 127 were fatal.<ref name=copp100/> The majority of these losses occurred on 4 July&mdash; the RWR and The North Shore Regiment took approximately 130 casualties each on the first day.<ref name=roy50/>  In total, 17 tanks were lost by the 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment, with an unknown number of losses by the Sherbrooke Fusiliers.<ref>Copp, p. 98&ndash;100</ref> Casualty statistics for the German defenders indicate 155 total losses,<ref name=copp100/> the majority of which occurred during the counter-attacks on 5 July.<ref name=copp101>Copp, p. 101</ref>
