The first storm, Tropical Depression One, developed on June&nbsp;15, and dissipated two days later without effects on land. Later that month, [[Tropical Storm Allison (1989)|Tropical Storm Allison]] caused severe flooding, especially in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Tropical Storm Barry, Tropical Depressions Six, Nine, and Thirteen, and Hurricanes Erin and Felix caused negligible impact. [[Hurricane Gabrielle (1989)|Hurricane Gabrielle]] and Tropical Storm Iris caused light effects on land, with the former resulting in nine fatalities from rip currents offshore the [[East Coast of the United States]] and [[Atlantic Canada]], while the latter produced minor flooding in the [[United States Virgin Islands]].

The most notable storm of the season was [[Hurricane Hugo]], a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane that caused at least $10&nbsp;billion (1989&nbsp;USD){{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1989 [[United States dollar|USD]], unless otherwise noted|group="nb"}} in damage and 88&nbsp;fatalities as it ravaged the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[United States]], especially the state of [[South Carolina]].

[[Hurricane Dean (1989)|Hurricane Dean]] also caused light damage in [[Bermuda]] and the Canadian [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Tropical Storm Karen, the final storm of the season, brought heavy rainfall and a tornado to Cuba, before dissipating on December&nbsp;4.

Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as [[William M. Gray|Dr. William M. Gray]] and his associates at [[Colorado State University]] (CSU). A normal season as defined by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), has eleven named storms, of which six reach hurricane strength and two of those become major hurricanes.{{#tag:ref|A major hurricane is a storm that ranks as Category&nbsp;3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale]].<ref name="ACE"/>|group="nb"}}<ref name="background">{{cite report|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|url=http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml|title=Background information: the North Atlantic Hurricane Season|date=May 27, 2010|work=[[Climate Prediction Center]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510081844/http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/background_information.shtml| archivedate= 10 May 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no|accessdate=May 10, 2014|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> On May 31, 1989, the CSU forecast that there would be seven named storms, four of which would intensify into a hurricane; there was no prediction of the number of major hurricanes.<ref name="CSU">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Lb8sAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lxQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4610,13531&dq=1989+atlantic+hurricane+season&hl=en|title=4 hurricane for the Atlantic predicted in 1989|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=June 1, 1989|newspaper=[[Star-News]]|accessdate=May 10, 2014|location=Bal Harbour, Florida}}</ref> Prior to the season, the Weather Research Center (WRC) in [[Houston, Texas]] also issued a forecast, which called for ten named storms and six hurricanes.<ref name="wrc">{{cite report|url=http://www.wxresearch.com/outlook/2008wrcvsco.pdf|title=Comparison of Weather Research Center<U+2019>s OCSI Atlantic Annual Seasonal Hurricane Forecasts with Colorado State Professor Bill Gray<U+2019>s Seasonal Forecast|author=Jill F.

===Season activity===
The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1989.<ref name="CSU"/> It was an above average season in which 15 tropical depressions formed. Eleven depressions attained tropical storm status, and seven of these attained hurricane status. Two hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes. The season was above average most likely because of relatively small amounts of dust within the [[Saharan Air Layer]]. Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season<ref name="AHS1989">{{cite report|author=Robert A. Case and B.

[[Tropical cyclogenesis]] in the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season began with a tropical depression developing on June 16. Later that month, another tropical depression developed, and intensified, eventually becoming Tropical Storm Allison. After June, the month of July was slightly more active with three tropical depressions developing; however, the latter two (Hurricane Chantal and Hurricane Dean) did not form until extremely late in the month. August was the most active month of the season, with a total of seven tropical cyclones either existing or developing in that period.<ref name="AHS1989"/> Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season,<ref name="season"/> only two tropical cyclones developed in that month, which later become Hurricane Hugo and Tropical Storm Iris. Two tropical cyclones also developed in October, and the latter one in that month eventually became Hurricane Jerry. Finally, one tropical cyclone developed in November; it eventually became Tropical Storm Karen and lasted until December&nbsp;4.<ref name="AHS1989"/>

The season's activity was reflected with a cumulative [[accumulated cyclone energy]] (ACE) rating of 135,<ref name="ACE">{{cite report|work=Hurricane Research Division|publisher=Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 2011|title=Atlantic basin Comparison of Original and Revised HURDAT|accessdate=May 10, 2014|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Comparison_of_Original_and_Revised_HURDAT_mar11.html|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref> which is classified as "above normal".<ref name="background"/> ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39&nbsp;mph (63&nbsp;km/h), which is tropical storm intensity.<ref>{{cite report|author=David Levinson|date=August 20, 2008|title=2005 Atlantic Ocean Tropical Cyclones|work=National Climatic Data Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=July 23, 2011|location=Asheville, North Carolina|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2005/2005-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629015634/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2005/2005-atlantic-trop-cyclones.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Oceam from the west coast of Africa on July&nbsp;7. The wave quickly developed a low-level circulation by July&nbsp;9 and was designated Tropical Depression Three at 1800&nbsp;UTC, while located about midway between Africa and the [[Lesser Antilles]].

In late July, a tropical disturbance within the [[intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ) was first observed near [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. The disturbance later reached the Gulf of Mexico and developed into a tropical depression on July&nbsp;30. While heading north-northwestward, the depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day. Thereafter, Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August&nbsp;1. After intensifying slightly further, it made landfall near [[High Island, Texas]] later that day. The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall. Early on August 2, Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August 4.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/chantal/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Chantal 30 July to 3 August 1989|page=1|author=Harold P.

A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five on July&nbsp;31, while situated about half way between [[Cape Verde]] and the [[Lesser Antilles]]. The following day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dean. Heading generally west-northwestward, Dean intensified into a hurricane on August&nbsp;2. The storm remained a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane as it curved northward, bypassing the Lesser Antilles. Tracking northward, Dean accelerated and intensified into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane while bypassing Bermuda late on August&nbsp;6. Thereafter, Dean turned northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm, before making landfall in southern Newfoundland on August&nbsp;8.

As Dean approached the Lesser Antilles, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported in [[Antigua]] and [[Barbuda]]. However, no damage was reported. In Bermuda, winds gusted up to 113&nbsp;mph (182&nbsp;km/h) and 3<U+2013>5&nbsp;inches (76.2<U+2013>127&nbsp;mm) of precipitation fell. Although Dean caused no fatalities, 16&nbsp;people were injured. According to insurance claims, the storm damaged 648&nbsp;buildings, 72&nbsp;boats, 36&nbsp;vehicles, and one pier.

An organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August&nbsp;16. Convection diminished due to cooler sea surface temperatures, but a small, well-defined low-level circulation remained. The convection later redeveloped, and the system became a tropical depression early on August&nbsp;18, while located just southeast of Cape Verde. Thereafter, the [[Fujiwhara effect|interaction]] between the tropical depression, a tropical wave, and a subtropical system caused it to move north-northwestward. The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Erin at 1800&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;19.<ref name="etcr"/>

Erin continued to move north-northwestward, until curving northward on August&nbsp;21. The storm intensified into a hurricane on August&nbsp;22, after being in the northeastern quadrant of an upper-level low, which caused the flow aloft to become more divergent. It slowed and began to move northwestward while northeast of the upper-level low. However, shortly thereafter, a wave moving westward forced Erin to move north and eventually north-northeastward. Early on August&nbsp;24, the storm strengthened into a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane. Later that day, Erin peaked with sustained winds of 105&nbsp;mph (165&nbsp;km/h). The storm then began to weaken and degenerated into a tropical storm on August&nbsp;27. Shortly thereafter, Erin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far northern Atlantic.<ref name="etcr">{{cite report|author=Jim Gross|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Erin (18 - 27 August, 1989)|date=December 4, 1989|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=March 1, 2014|url= http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/erin/prelim01.gif|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>

A tropical wave was observed over northwestern Africa on August&nbsp;24. By the following day, the system moved into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. It immediately began organized and became Tropical Depression Eight at 0000&nbsp;UTC on August&nbsp;26. The depression initially headed west-northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Shortly thereafter, the storm grazed Cape Verde, with some islands reporting sustained winds near 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h). Between August&nbsp;27 and August&nbsp;29, Felix drifted north-northwestward in response to a persistent upper-level trough. Southwesterly winds sheared away much of the deep convection, causing Felix to weaken back to a tropical depression on August&nbsp;29.<ref name="felixtcr">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/felix/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Felix 25 August &ndash; 10 September 1989|date=November 17, 1989|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|work=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=May 9, 2014|location=Miami, Florida}}</ref>

The storm then headed northwestward, until a weak frontal trough turned Felix northward on September&nbsp;1. Wind shear decreased, allowing Felix to become a tropical storm again on September&nbsp;3. The storm continued to strengthen while moving west-northwestward and by early on September&nbsp;5, it became a hurricane. Later that day, Felix peaked with winds of 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h). Drifting north-northeastward, the storm eventually began to accelerate, after weakening back to a tropical storm on September&nbsp;7, due to colder sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear.

A westward moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on September&nbsp;10, while located southeast of Cape Verde. It headed generally westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hugo on September&nbsp;11. Hugo became a hurricane by September&nbsp;13. After becoming a major hurricane early on September&nbsp;15, rapid intensification commenced, and less than 24&nbsp;hours later, Hugo peaked as a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane as winds of 160&nbsp;mph (260&nbsp;km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of {{convert|918|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}. Six hours later, Hugo weakened back to a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane. After weakening on September&nbsp;17, Hugo entered the Caribbean Sea after passing between [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Montserrat]] with winds near 140&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) and later made landfall on [[St. Croix]] at the same intensity. Hugo was further downgraded to a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane, before landfall on eastern [[Puerto Rico]]. The storm weakened to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane on September&nbsp;18, after re-emerging into the Atlantic. As Hugo accelerated to the northwest, re-intensification occurred, and it eventually reached a secondary peak intensity as a low-end Category&nbsp;4 hurricane. Early on September&nbsp;22, Hugo made landfall near [[Charleston, South Carolina]] with winds of 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h). After landfall, Hugo rapidly weakened as it turned to the northeast, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in northwestern [[Pennsylvania]] on September&nbsp;23.

{{Main|Hurricane Jerry (1989)}}
A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September&nbsp;23. Only minimal development occurred as the wave crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. However, after crossing the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula and emerging into the [[Bay of Campeche]] on October&nbsp;12, it developed into a tropical depression. The system quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Jerry on the following day. Jerry tracked generally northward while intensifying and reached hurricane status on October&nbsp;15.<ref name="Jprelim1">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/jerry/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Jerry 12 &ndash; 16 October 1989|author=B.

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on November&nbsp;13 and failed to organize until reaching the western Caribbean Sea. Favorable conditions allowed convection to concentrate around a developing low-level circulation. On November&nbsp;28, satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the development of a tropical depression just north of Honduras. The depression moved northwestward then northeastward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Karen on November&nbsp;30, while located southwest of [[Isla de la Juventud]], Cuba. Within 12&nbsp;hours of reaching tropical storm intensity, Karen peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h). Around that time, a building ridge in the Gulf of Mexico forced the storm southeastward.<ref name="page1">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1989-prelim/karen/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report Tropical Storm Karen 28 November &ndash; 4 December 1989|author=Lixion A.

== Storm names ==
{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
The following names were used for named storms that formed in the north Atlantic in 1989. The names not retired from this list were used again in the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]]. This is the same list used for the [[1983 Atlantic hurricane season|1983 season]] except for Allison, which replaced [[Hurricane Alicia|Alicia]].<ref name="CSU"/> Storms were named Allison, Erin, Felix, Gabrielle, Hugo, Iris, Jerry, and Karen for the first time in 1989. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] retired one name in the spring of 1990: Hugo. It was replaced in the [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995 season]] by Humberto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml|title=Retired Hurricane Names Since 1954|author=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=March 16, 2011|accessdate=July 14, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110628193705/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/retirednames.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Names that were not assigned are marked in {{tcname unused}}.
