'''Jack Chrisman''' (1928 &mdash; [[August 17]] [[1989]]) was an American [[drag racing|drag racer]]. He was a dragracing pioneer and 1961 champion. He was influential in the formation of the [[Funny Car]] class, as he introduced the first [[supercharger|blown]], injected, [[nitrous oxide|nitro-burning]] Funny Car.<ref name=NationalDragsterDeathAnnouncement>[http://www.nhraonline.com/50th/news/index.html?story=107 Drag racing pioneer Chrisman passes away], ''[[National Dragster]]''; [[September 8]] [[1989]], Retrieved [[March 7]] [[2008]]</ref> The [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) ranked Chrisman 23rd on their Top 50 drivers in 2001.<ref name=NHRATop50>[http://nhra.com/50th/top50/J_Chrisman23.html No. 23: Jack Chrisman], [[National Hot Rod Association]]; written in 2001, Retrieved [[March 4]] [[2008]]</ref>

==Background==
Chrisman was born the youngest of 13 children in [[Grove, Oklahoma]]. The family moved to Southern [[California]] to escape the [[Dust Bowl]].<ref name=NHRATop50 />

==Racing career==
Chrisman began drag racing in 1953 when he raced a 1929 [[Model A]].<ref name=NationalDragsterDeathAnnouncement /> He switched to a [[Chrysler]] car, continuing to race at Southern California such as Lions, [[Infineon Raceway|Ponoma]], San Fernando, Santa Ana, and [[Saugus Speedway|Saugus]].<ref name=NHRATop50 /> He purchased the Purple Car from Ed Lusinski, and used the car to win drag races at many of these tracks.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> He started racing [[Top Fuel]] for [[Pat Akins]]. Masters & Richter flew Chrisman to the Bay area to race in their Top Fuel dragster.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> 

In 1959 he started racing in Chuck Jones Sidewinder dragster. The car, wrenched by Joe Maillard, had its motor mounded sideways. It was shorter than the 100 inch standard that was common at that time. The car consistently had 9.0 second elapsed times (e.t.) at {{convert|160|mph}}, which typically defeated local competition.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> 

In late 1960, he moved to Howard Johansen's team. He raced the Howard Cam "Twin Bears" gas dragster, which featured two side-mounted engines. He used the car for the first 8 second run in NHRA national event history, when his 8.99 second run beat [[Dick Rea]] at the first (1961) [[Winternationals]] [[Top Eliminator]] (Top Gas) finals.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> That summer he drove to a 8.78 e.t. at [[Caddo Mills, Texas]], which was the lowest e.t. of the year.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> Chrisman won the 1961 World Championship after winning in national, regional, and divisional meets thoughout the United States.<ref>[http://www.nhra.net/50th/news/index.html?story=3 Jack Chrisman ends season with 550 points], ''[[National Dragster]]''; [[September 8]] [[1961]], Retrieved [[March 7]] [[2008]]</ref>

Chrisman changed to [[Mickey Thompson]]'s team in 1962. The [[Tommy Ivo]]-built machine raced with either gasoline and [[nitrous oxide]]. He set a new top speed of {{convert|176.60|mph|km/h}} at [[York, Pennsylvania]] and a new e.t. A/GD record with a 8.34 second run.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> The team debuted a new [[Pontiac]] [[Hemi engine]] a few weeks before the [[U.S. Nationals]] and won the Indy Top Eliminator crown.<ref name=NHRATop50 />

During a regular afternoon event at [[Infineon Raceway|Ponoma]] in May 1963, the dragster's rear end broke. Chrisman spent 42 days in the hospital recovering.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> After he had recovered, he started working advertising for ''National Dragster''. Chrisman intended to drive Thompson's dragster to defend his title at Indianapolis, but Thompson's hauler tipped over while transporting the vehicle to the dragstrip.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> 

===Funnycar pioneer===
Chrisman was working for the NHRA in late 1963 or early 1964 when [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] Fran Hernandez gave a [[Mercury Comet]] to Chrisman. After Chrisman didn't race the vehicle, Hernandez asked, "What's going to get you to race that car?"<ref name=NHRATop50 /> Chrisman responded that he wanted a [[Supercharger|blower]] to be installed in the car. Chrisman went to a dealer, picked up the racecar, and brought it to [[Bill Stroppe]]'s shop. The pair and their crew assembled the car.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> The car was debuted at the 1964 U.S. Nationals with Chrisman doing a burnout to half track. Chrisman toured the eastern half of the United States with the car though the end of the 1965 season. In 1966, he added a flip-up fiberglass body on the car, following a trend started by [[Don Nicholson]] and [[Eddie Schartman]].<ref name=NHRATop50 /> Chrisman won his first race, at the Hot Rod Magazine Championships at Riverside Race, in the Exhibition Stock category. It is generally considered to be the first Funny Car to exceed 180 miles per hour.<ref name=NationalDragsterDeathAnnouncement /> The car ran the quarter mile in 8.72 seconds (184 miles per hour), beating [[Jim Liberman|Jungle Jim Liberman]] in the finals.<ref name=NHRATop50 /> On [[July 10]] [[1966]] he set a class record at {{convert|188|mph|km/h}}, only to have the engine blow up two weeks later at the Super Stock Magazine Nationals. The car burned to the ground.

Chrisman came back with another Comet to race the rest of the 1966 season through 1970. Chrisman didn't race in 1971. He built a "sidewinder" Mustang funny car for 1972, but didn't race it. He sold it to Ray Maheu, and the car later became [[John Force]]'s first ride called "Nightstalker".<ref name=NationalDragsterDeathAnnouncement />

==Chrisman Driveline Components==
During that time, he started Chrisman Driveline Components at his hometown [[Long Beach, California]]. The company builds car rear ends and driveline components for dragracers. It has supplied components to [[Kenny Bernstein]], [[Frank Bradley]], [[Darrell Gwynn]], [[Eddie Hill]], and [[Joe Pisano]].<ref name=NationalDragsterDeathAnnouncement /> He continued running the company until his death in 1989.<ref name=NHRATop50 />
