'''Maya Ying Lin''' (born October 5, 1959) is an American artist who is known for her work in [[sculpture]] and [[landscape art]]. She is the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington, D.C.<ref name="NYTimesPeople">{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/maya_lin/index.html|title=Maya Lin|work=The New York Times |accessdate=January 2, 2009 | first=Edward | last=Rothstein}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Maya Lin, a [[Chinese American]], was born in [[Athens, Ohio]]. Her parents immigrated to the United States from People's Republic of China in 1949 and settled in Ohio in 1958, one year before Maya Lin was born.<ref name="NYTimes2006">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/nyregion/thecity/05maya.html|author=Paul Berger|title=Ancient Echoes in a Modern Space|work=The New York Times |date=November 5, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref>  Her father, Henry Huan Lin, was a [[ceramist]] and former dean of the [[Ohio University]] College of Fine Arts.<ref name="NYTimesPeople" />  She is the niece of [[Lin Huiyin]], who is said to be the first female architect in China.<ref name="RoweAndSeng">{{cite book|authors=Peter G.

She has also been awarded honorary doctorate degrees from Yale University, [[Harvard University]], [[Williams College]], and [[Smith College]].<ref name="FAMSF">{{cite web|url=http://72.5.117.194/content.asp?key=139|title=Maya Lin: Systematic Landscapes|publisher=[[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]]|accessdate=January 2, 2009}}</ref> She was among the youngest in Yale University when she received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts in 1987.<ref name="Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110480/|title=Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>  She is married to Daniel Wolf, a New York photography dealer. They have two daughters, India and Rachel.<ref name="NYTimesPeople" /


Lin is the youngest and has an older brother who is an English professor and [[poet]]. Growing up, she did not have many friends and stayed home a lot. She loved school and loved to study. When she was not studying, she took independent courses from [[Ohio University]] and spent her free time casting bronzes in the school foundry.<ref name="Seeing the World Differently">http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/lin0int-1</ref> Lin, having grown up as an asian minority, has said that she "didn't even realize" she was [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] until later in life, and that it was not until her 30s that she had a desire to understand her cultural background.<ref name="AAM">{{cite web|url=http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/mayalin.cfm|title=Between Art and Architecture: The Memory Works of Maya Lin|publisher=[[American Association of Museums]]|month=July/August|year=2008|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>  Commenting on her design of a new home for the [[Museum of Chinese in America]] near New York City's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], Lin attached a personal significance to the project being a Chinese-related project because she wanted her two daughters to "know that part of their heritage."<ref name="NYTimes2006" />

==Vietnam Veterans Memorial==
[[Image:MayaLinsubmission.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Vietnam War Memorial original design submission by Maya Lin]]
In 1981, at age 21 and while still an undergraduate, Lin won a public design competition for the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], beating out 1,441 other competition submissions.<ref name="LOC">{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trm022.html|title=Vietnam Veterans Memorial|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref>  The black cut-stone masonry wall, with the names of 58,261 fallen soldiers carved into its face,<ref name="VVMFFacts">{{cite web|url=http://www.vvmf.org/index.cfm?sectionID=539|title= Facts and Figures|publisher=Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> was completed in late October 1982 and dedicated on November 13, 1982.<ref name="VVMFHistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.vvmf.org/index.cfm?SectionID=76|title=History|publisher=Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> The wall is granite and V-shaped, with one side pointing to the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the other to the [[Washington Monument]].<ref name="VVMFFacts" />

Lin's conception was to create an opening or a wound in the earth to symbolize the gravity of the loss of the soldiers.  The design was initially controversial for what was an unconventional and non-traditional design for a war memorial. Opponents of the design also voiced objection because of Lin's Asian heritage.<ref name="AAM" /><ref name="GreenMuseum">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/lin.php|author=Marla Hochman|title=Maya Lin, Vietnam Memorial|publisher=greenmuseum.org|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref><ref name="JackMagazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.jackmagazine.com/issue9/essayksands.html|title=Maya Lin's Wall: A Tribute to Americans|publisher=Jack Magazine|author=Kristal Sands|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref> However, the memorial has since become an important pilgrimage site for relatives and friends of the American military casualties in Vietnam, and personal tokens and mementos are left at the wall daily in their memory.<ref>[http://www.gale.com/free_resources/whm/bio/lin_m.htm Gale - Free Resources - Women's History - Biographies - Maya Lin<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Maya_Lin.html Maya Lin - Great Buildings Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Lin believes that if the competition had not been "blind", with designs submitted by number instead of name, she "never would have won". She received harassment after her ethnicity was revealed - prominent businessman and later 3rd party presidential candidate [[Ross Perot]] was known to have called her an "egg roll" after it was revealed that she was Asian.<ref name="Wu">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ybl1AAAAMAAJ|title=Yellow: Race In America Beyond Black and White|pages=95|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2002|author=Frank H. Wu|isbn=0465006396}}</ref> Lin defended her design in front of the [[United States Congress]], and eventually a compromise was reached. [[The Three Soldiers|A bronze statue of a group of soldiers and an American flag]] was placed off to one side of the monument as a result.

==Work after the Vietnam Veterans Memorial==
[[File:Maya Lin sculpture.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Sculpture of 2x4 on display at the [[De Young Museum]] in San Francisco, 2009]]

Lin, who now owns and operates Maya Lin Studio in New York City, went on to design other structures, including the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] (1989) and the Wave Field at the [[University of Michigan]] (1995).<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/lin/card2.html Art:21 . Maya Lin's "Wave Field" PBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 1994, she was the subject of the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning documentary ''[[Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision]]''. The title comes from an address she gave at Yale in which she spoke of the monument design process. Talking about the origin of her work, Lin says "My work originates from a simple desire to make people aware of their surroundings and this can include not just the physical but the psychological world that we live in".<ref name="Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110480/}}</ref>

According to Maya Lin, art should be an act of every individual willing to say something new and that which is not quite familiar.<ref name="Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110480/}}</ref> When a project comes her way, she tries to "understand the definition (of the site) in a verbal before finding the form. To understand what a piece is conceptually and what its nature should be even before visiting the site".<ref name="Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110480/}}</ref>

In 2000, Lin re-emerged in the public life with a book entitled ''Boundaries''.<ref>[http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/maya.shtml Maya Lin emerges from the shadows]</ref> Also in 2000, she agreed to act as the artist and architect for the [[Confluence Project]], a series of outdoor installations at historical points along the [[Columbia River]] and [[Snake River]] in the states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. This is the largest and longest project that she has undertaken so far.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Meeting Of Minds|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/pacificnw06122005/coverstory.html|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=June 12, 2005|accessdate=September 7, 2006}}</ref>

In 2002, Lin was elected Alumni Fellow of the [[Yale Corporation]], the governing body of [[Yale University]] (upon whose campus sits another of Lin's designs: the Women's Table - designed to commemorate the role of women at Yale University), in an unusually public contest. Her opponent was W. David Lee, a local New Haven minister and graduate of the [[Yale Divinity School]] who was running on a platform to build ties to the community with the support of Yale's unionized employees. Lin was supported by Yale's President [[Richard Levin]], other members of the Yale Corporation, and was the officially endorsed candidate of the Association of Yale Alumni.

In 2003, Lin served on the selection jury of the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]]. A trend toward [[minimalism]] and [[abstract art|abstraction]] was noted among the entrants, finalists, and current [[World Trade Center Memorial]].

In 2005, Lin was elected to [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]], as well as the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls]], New York.

Lin was commissioned by [[Ohio University]] to design what is known as punch card park, a landscape literally designed to resemble a [[punched card]], supposedly based on Lin's memories of their early use in universities. The park is a large open space with rectangular mounds and voids on the ground.<sup>[http://www.ohiou.edu/Athens/bldgifs/bicentennial2.jpg photo]</sup> At first the park was criticized for being relatively uninviting (with punched card pits promoting mosquito infestation and preventing safe active recreation) and lacked trees or structures to shade students from the sun. In addition, from the ground level, it is difficult to tell what the park is supposed to look like, though from an aerial view it does resemble a punched card. Although the university since planted trees around the park's perimeter in an attempt to make it a more popular place for students to gather, this has been unsuccessful.<ref>[http://www.athensnews.com/letters/money-spent-on-new-ou-park-could-have-been-better-spent?Itemid=0 The Athens NEWS | Money spent on new OU park could have been better spent<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.mayalin.org Maya Lin's Bicentennial Park at Ohio University in Athens Ohio - IBM Punch Card Art is no Vietnam Veterans Memorial<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2007, Lin installed "[[Above and Below]]", an outdoor sculpture at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] in Indiana. "[[Above and Below]]" is made of aluminum tubing that has been electrolytically colored during the anodization process.

In 2008, Lin completed a 30-ton sculpture called "2 x 4 Landscape," which is on exhibit at the [[M.H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/10/24/DD3713HMF1.DTL Maya Lin looks at nature - from the inside]</ref> Her current projects include an installation at the [[Storm King Art Center]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Carol|last= Kino|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Once Inspired by a War, Now by the Land  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/arts/design/09kino.html |quote=On a gray, unusually muggy October day the artist and architect Maya Lin was showing a visitor around <U+201C>Wave Field,<U+201D> her new earthwork project at the Storm King Art Center here.

In 2009, Lin completed "Silver River," her first work of art in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], which is part of a public fine art collection at [[MGM Mirage|MGM Mirage's]] [[CityCenter]], which opened December 2009. Lin created an {{convert|84|ft|m|adj=on}} cast of the [[Colorado River]] made entirely of reclaimed silver. With the sculpture, Lin wanted to make a statement about water conservation and the importance of the Colorado River to Nevada in terms of energy and water.<ref>{{cite news|title=Artist Maya Lin Provides 'Silver River' for Vegas' CityCenter Megaresort |first=Steve|last=Friess|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=Jan 1, 2010|work=[[Sphere News]]|url=http://www.sphere.com/nation/article/artist-maya-lin-provides-silver-river-for-vegas-citycenter-megaresort/19283624}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The sculpture is displayed behind the front desk of the [[Aria Resort & Casino]].

In 2009, Maya Lin was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>[http://www.nea.gov/news/news10/Medals.html White House Announces 2009 National Medal of Arts Recipients]</ref>

Maya Lin is represented by The [[Pace Gallery]] in New York.

==Chronological order of Works==
[[File:SMLwithMayaLinWomenatYale.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Maya Lin's 'Women's Table' in front of the [[Sterling Memorial Library]] commemorating the role of women at [[Yale University]]]]
Maya Lin is one of the most prominent architects in the 21st century. Although she started out in the 20th century, her vision and focus was always on how the space needed to be in the future and what it meant to the people. She tried to focus less on how politics influenced design but more on what emotions the space would create and what it would symbolize to the user. Her belief in a space being connected and the transition from inside to outside being fluid, coupled with what a space means, has led her to create some very memorable designs. Along with architectural projects, Maya Lin also worked on several sculptures.
