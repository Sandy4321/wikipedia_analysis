'''Hampton Court Bridge''' crosses the [[River Thames]] in England approximately north<U+2013>south between [[Hampton, London]] and [[East Molesey]], Surrey. It is the upper of two road bridges on the reach above [[Teddington Lock]] and downstream of [[Molesey Lock]].

The bridge is the most upstream crossing of all of the Thames bridges of [[Greater London]]; uniquely one bank is within the county.

==Historic crossings==
;Ferry
The location of the bridge had been a ferry crossing point since at least the [[Tudor period]].

;First bridge
The first bridge was built from 1752 until 1753 and opened in December that year, after a 1750 parliamentary bill agreed on the construction of a privately owned bridge by James Clarke. It had seven wooden arches and was built in the [[Chinoiserie]] design of the Willow pattern that was popular at the time, attested by two prints made in the year of its opening and the year after.<ref name=page>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22204 |title=Spelthorne Hundred: Hampton: introduction |author=William Page (Editor) |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |date=1911 |work=A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2: General; Ashford, East Bedfont with Hatton, Feltham, Hampton with Hampton Wick, Hanworth, Laleham, Littleton |accessdate=9 August 2013}} </ref>

;Second bridge
This bridge was replaced by a more sturdy eleven-arch wooden bridge in 1778.<ref name=page/> By 1840 this bridge had become dilapidated and the owner appealed to the [[Corporation of London]] to support reconstruction. Among their arguments were that since the bridge was built, the City had created [[Molesey Lock|Molesey Lock and Weir]] and as a consequence navigation through the bridge was dangerous. The bridge was described at about this time as "crazy, hog-backed, inconvenient and obstructive of the navigation".<ref>Fred. S. Thacker ''The Thames Highway: Volume II Locks and Weirs'' 1920 <U+2013> republished 1968 [[David & Charles]]</ref>

;Third Bridge
From 1864 to 1865 construction of the first stone bridge took place, designed by E. T. Murray, the third bridge in all. It consisted of [[wrought iron]] lattice girders resting on four [[cast iron]] columns, described simply in 1911 by one Historic Gazetteer, the [[Victoria County Histories]] as "inartistic".<ref name=page/> The road approach was between [[battlement]]ed brick walls. An illustrative fragment of these approach walls remains on the south bank immediately west of the bridge.

==The modern bridge==
The modern bridge is the fourth on the site. The bridge has three wide arches, is designed to be able to carry quite heavy motorised road traffic and is constructed of [[reinforced concrete]], faced with red bricks and white [[portland stone]] (namely its the pontoons, dressings and balustrades).<ref name=eh/>

The bridge was opened by the Prince of Wales (who became [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]) on 3 July 1933, on the same day as the opening of [[Chiswick Bridge|Chiswick]] and [[Twickenham Bridge]]s, which carry the [[A316 road|A316]] (and between those sections is still occasionally nicknamed the 'Richmond bypass'). The bridge was [[Listed buildings|Grade II listed]] in 1952 for its architecture.<ref name=eh>Grade II listings {{NHLE|num=1358100}} and {{NHLE|num=1030182}} accessed 9 August 2013 </ref><ref>{{IoE|205353}} accessed 27 November 2008</ref>

It was designed by W. P. Robinson and Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] to reflect the style of the portions of [[Hampton Court Palace]] designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]] <U+2014> whose architectural style has another legacy by the bridge as his well-conserved blue-plaqued house in which he lived his final years faces the roundabout by the two north bank roads which meet just north of the bridge and palace front gate.<ref name=wren>Wren's latter-life home, the Old Court House, Grade II* listing {{NHLE|num=1080796}}</ref>

Construction began in 1930. The work required the demolition of a small hotel (''The Old Castle'') and, to the south, diversion of the flow of the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]] into the [[River Ember]], formerly the secondary [[distributary]] of the Mole.

===Surroundings===
;Immediate environs
Aside from two parallel lines of architecturally rich buildings and riverside homes <U+2013> approximately half of which are listed on the north bank<ref name=wren/> are [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court Palace and Gardens]], [[Hampton Court Park]] and [[Bushy Park]], [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Parks]].

On the south bank is a one-way street of restaurants, boutiques and bars surrounded by apartments immediately then homes with gardens west of [[Hampton Court railway station]]. On the Thames itself, a few hundred metres to either side are Molesey Lock on the Thames and the mouth of the [[River Mole, Surrey|River Mole]], on the south side.

===Roads===
;Hampton Court Way
The bridge construction was taken as the opportunity for [[Surrey County Council]] to construct a new road, which starts as the same road as before with its roundabout with the [[A308]] ([[Staines upon Thames|Staines]]<U+2013>[[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] road) (then running south between the palace's entrance driveway and a short row of a hotel/restaurant, a restaurant and shop), before becoming being considerably straighter than the existing old roads as a route south. This connects directly with the [[A307 road|A307]] (Old London<U+2013>Portsmouth road) and more recently with the [[A3(M) motorway]] deeper into Surrey than the old route.

;A3050
The A3050 commences immediately southwest of the bridge and passes through three riverside settlements: the rest of [[Molesey]] and the towns of [[Walton-on-Thames]] and [[Weybridge]] also in [[Elmbridge]], Surrey.

;Neighbouring bridges
The next bridge downstream is {{convert|1.5|mi}} and upstream is exactly {{convert|4|mi}}.<ref>[http://gridreferencefinder.com/ Grid Reference Finder] distance tools</ref>

The next downstream bridge has considerably older predecessors going back to the early medieval period and is the only other of the reach, [[Kingston Bridge, London]] <U+2014> it is pale brick and stone only and of taller design with two extra arches.

The next bridge upstream was replaced in 2013 with a the first single-span bridge heading up the Thames, a [[tied arch bridge]], [[Walton Bridge]].
