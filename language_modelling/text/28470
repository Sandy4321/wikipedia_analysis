'''Frank Blaichman''' (1922-) (occasionally spelled '''Frank Bleichman''', and in Polish '''Franek''' or '''Franciszek Blajchman''') was a Polish Jewish member of an armed organization during World War II.

==World War 2==
Frank Blaichman was born in [[Kamionka, Lubart<U+00F3>w County|Kamionka, Poland]] on December 11, 1922.<ref name="museum">{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007223 |title=Frank Bleichman |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10007223 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}</ref> His grandmother owned a grocery story and his father was a grain merchant. He was 16 years old at the time of the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939.<ref name="museum"/>

Although German officials issued decrees that limited Jewish travel outside of Kamionka and required Jews to identify themselves by wearing armbands, Blaichman took a number of risks in order to help his parents and six brothers and sisters.<ref name="museum"/> He rode his bicycle from the neighboring farms and villages to [[Lubart<U+00F3>w]] (six miles east) and [[Lublin]] (12 miles south) where he bought and sold goods such as honey, chickens, butters, grains, meat, tobacco, yarns, and sugar.<ref name="museum"/> Blaichman was able to travel among the population without being recognized as a [[Jew]] (he refused to wear the [[Star of David]] armband and traveled without the necessary permits).<ref name="museum"/> He was assigned to work two days a week on a nearby estate with crops, but instead he paid someone to fill his place and continued to engage in underground trading.<ref name="museum"/>

In October 1942, the Kamionka Jewish council ([[Judenrat]]) informed the Jewish residents that they would be resettled in the Lubart<U+00F3>w ghetto.<ref name="museum"/> Blaichman slipped out of Kamionka and went to a [[gentile]] farmer in the village of [[Kierzk<U+00F3>wka]] who offered him assistance (the family of [[Aleksander and Staisn<U+0142>awa G<U+0142>os]], which would later be listed among the [[Polish Righteous Among the Nations]]).<ref name="museum"/><ref name="GutmanLazare2004">{{cite book|author1=Israel Gutman|author2=Lucien Lazare|author3=Sara Bender|title=The Encyclopedia of the Righteous Among the Nations: Poland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OvQhAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 April 2011|year=2004|publisher=Yad Vashem|page=238}}</ref> He later learned that the Jews of Kamionka had not been relocated to the Lubart<U+00F3>w ghetto but rather were deported on trains to an unknown destination.<ref name="museum"/> Blaichman heard that a group of Jews was hiding in the forest, so after two days with the farmer, he made his way to the forest and found more than one hundred Jews living in an encampment of small bunkers in the forest.<ref name="museum"/> He realized that the group was in constant danger. Blaichman encouraged the group to form a defense unit to guard the camp even though they had no firearms.<ref name="museum"/> In December 1942 the group managed to acquire firearms from a local Polish farmer.<ref name="museum"/> (However, according to another biography, it was only in summer of 1943 that Blaichman left the G<U+0142>os family and joined the resistance).<ref name="GutmanLazare2004"/>

Over time, Blaichman's unit increased in size.<ref name="museum"/> They were joined by refugees from [[Markuszow]] and expanded to sixty fighters. In the spring of 1943, Blaichman encountered [[Samuel Gruber (partisan)|Samuel Gruber]].<ref name="museum"/> Gruber's group consisted of men who had fought with the [[Polish Army]] and knew how to use explosives and mines.<ref name="museum"/> The two groups joined together and became a more effective fighting force.<ref name="museum"/> By September 1943, the [[Polish People's Army]] realized that the Blaichman and Gruber groups could be a dependable ally in the fight against the Germans and provided them with supplies that had been parachuted in by the Soviet air force.<ref name="museum"/> Now equipped with hand grenades, explosives, land mines, machine guns, and ammunition, the group could be even more successful in fighting the Germans.<ref name="museum"/>

In 1944, Blaichman's group received an order from the People's Army to move east and join forces with another Jewish partisan unit in the [[Parczew]] area commanded by [[Yechiel Grynszpan]].<ref name="museum"/> Gruber was appointed deputy commander and Blaichman, at the age of 21, became the unit's youngest [[platoon]] commander.<ref name="museum"/> In July 1944, the Soviet [[Red Army]] advanced from the east and entered the Parczew forest.<ref name="museum"/> Also that month, [[Lublin]] was taken from the Germans by the Soviets, and Blaichman's partisan group entered the city.<ref name="GutmanLazare2004"/>

After the war, Blaichman married Cesia Pomeranc, who had also lived in the Parczew area, and six years later they settled in the [[United States]].<ref name="museum"/>

Near the end of the war and Immediately afterward (April to 19 July 1945) he has worked for the Polish communist [[secret police]] ([[Office of Public Security]]), as the temporary head of the Department of Prisons and Camps (''Wydzia<U+0142> Wi<U+0119>zie<U+0144> i Oboz<U+00F3>w'') in the [[Kielce]]'s Voivode Office of Public Security (''Wew<U+00F3>dzki Urz<U+0105>d Bezpiecze<U+0144>stwa Pa<U+0144>stwowego'', WUBP).<ref name=ipn>{{pl icon}} [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/ftp/twarze_kieleckiej_bezpieki/plansze/pdf/plansza_24.pdf Franciszek Blajchman] at the [http://www.ipn.gov.pl/ftp/twarze_kieleckiej_bezpieki/index.html "Twarze kieleckiej bezpieki"] exhibition.

The book has been criticized in Poland for controversial, [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] claims, such as the accusation of widespread [[antisemitism]] in [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK, or Home Army).<ref name=rp1/><ref name=newsweek/><ref name=tvn/> [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Aronson]], a former Polish-Jewish officer of the AK, called the charges made in the book against the Home Army "absurd",<ref name=rp1/> as did Polish historians such as [[Jan <U+017B>aryn]] and [[Waldemar Paruch]] (see also [[Armia_Krajowa#Interaction_with_the_Jewish_community_and_Jewish_resistance|Armia Krajowa and the Jews]]).<ref name=tvn/><ref name=rp1/> Blaichman portrayal of his activities in Jewish resistance has been questioned, and it has been alleged that he was a member of a criminal gang (associated with communist [[Gwardia Ludowa]] resistance) which focused on forcefully obtaining provisions from the local populace and clashed with the Polish resistance.<ref name=rp1/><ref name=rp3/> Blaichman also mentions that at one point he shot dead two AK soldiers, which has led to demands for this case to be investigated as a murder.<ref name=rp1/><ref name=rp2/><ref name=newsweek/> Spokesman for the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] has declared that Blaichman's book will be investigated to determine whether he is guilty of what Polish legal system describes as "[[communist crime]]s".<ref name=rp3/>
