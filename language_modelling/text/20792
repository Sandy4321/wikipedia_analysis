'''Fred Neil''' (March 16, 1936 <U+2013> July 7, 2001)<ref name="Dead">[http://thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2001.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed July 2010</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] [[singer]] and [[songwriter]], whose career developed in the 1960s and early 1970s, after which he left the [[music industry]]. He wrote the [[hit record|hits]] "Candy Man" (the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]") and "[[Everybody's Talkin']]" ([[Harry Nilsson]]),<ref name="Dead"/> as well as the ballad "A Little Bit Of Rain" and the rock standard "The Other Side of This Life", most famously recorded by [[Jefferson Airplane]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] and raised in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], Neil was exposed to music at an early age, travelling around the US with his father who was a representative for [[Wurlitzer]] jukeboxes.<ref name="Brend">Brend, Mark (2001) "Fred Neil", ''[[Record Collector]]'', No. 265, September 2001, p. 11</ref> Neil was one of the singer-songwriters who worked out of [[New York City]]'s [[Brill Building]], a center for music industry offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/realestate/03scapes.html?_r=1 |title=Streetscapes | The Brill Building - Built With a Broken Heart - NYTimes.com |publisher=www.nytimes.com |accessdate=2010-12-04 }}</ref>  While composing at the Brill Building for other artists, Neil also recorded six mostly rockabilly-pop oriented singles for different labels as a solo artist.<ref name="Brend" /> 

His first LP, ''Tear Down The Walls'' (1965) was recorded with [[Vince Martin (singer)|Vince Martin]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> During 1965 and 1966 Neil was joined on many live sets by the Seventh Sons, a trio trio led by [[Buzzy Linhart]] on guitar and vibes. 

Neil released ''[[Bleecker & MacDougal]]'' on [[Elektra Records]] in 1965, reissued in 1970 as ''A Little Bit of Rain''. ''Fred Neil'' (released in 1966, relaunched in 1969 as ''Everybody's Talkin''') was recorded during his residences in [[Greenwich Village]] and [[Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida|Coconut Grove]], [[Florida]], respectively (although for the latter, one session took place in Los Angeles).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

After "Everybody's Talkin'", Neil's best-known song is "The Dolphins", which was later recorded by several artists including [[Tim Buckley]], for whom Neil was a major influence.<ref name="Brend" /> Interested in dolphins since the mid 1960s, when he had begun visiting the Miami Seaquarium, with Ric O<U+2019>Barry in 1970 Neil founded The Dolphin Research Project, an organization dedicated (according to Neil himself) to stopping the capture, trafficking and exploitation of dolphins worldwide.<ref name="Brend" /> Increasingly involved in that pursuit, Neil progressively disappeared from the recording studio and live performance, with only occasional performances in the rest of the 1970s.<ref name="Brend" />

==Later life and death==
Neil left Woodstock in the mid 1970s and spent his remaining decades on the shores of southern Florida, involved in The Dolphin Project. After playing with Stephen Stills at New York City's [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1970, Neil began a long retirement, performing in public mostly at gigs for the Dolphin Project Revue in Coconut Grove, although in 1977 he played a benefit show for the Revue in Tokyo. A live date occurred in July 1975 at The Montreux Jazz Festival,<ref>[http://www.montreuxsounds.com/detail2006.php?fiche=299 Setlist from Montreux Jazz Festival database]</ref> when Neil played with his core group of [[John Sebastian]] on harp,<!--check the ref, hca isn't autoharp--> [[Harvey Brooks]] on bass, and Pete Childs on guitar. [[Michael Lang (producer)|Michael Lang]], one of the organizers of the 1969 [[Woodstock]] Festival and a 1970s Coconut Grove scene habitu<U+00E9>e, tried unsuccessfully to release this as a live LP.  His last public performances was in 1981 at an outdoor concert at the Old Grove Pub in Coconut Grove, where he joined Buzzy Linhart for one song and stayed onstage for the rest of the set.

Many of Neil's 1970s recordings remain unissued, including a 1973 session with [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] guitarist [[John Cipollina]]. Ric O'Barry claimed in an interview for the unofficial online website fredneil.com that two albums recorded between 1977 and 1978 - each including approximately 10 covers, not originals - were buried by Columbia Records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fredneil.com/ric-obarry/ |title=Fred Neil <U+00BB> Ric O<U+2019>Barry |publisher=www.fredneil.com |accessdate=2010-12-04 }}</ref> On the first of those purported recordings, the sessions produced in Miami by O'Barry himself, Neil was joined by Pete Childs on guitar, [[John Sebastian]] on harp, and [[Harvey Brooks]] on bass. The second album was more fully arranged, with Neil accompanied by the New York session band [[Stuff (band)|Stuff]] and some old friends like Slick Aguilar. The songs on these albums were written by [[Bobby Charles]], "[[Hey Joe]]"'s writer Billy Roberts, John Braheny and Bobby Ingram.

He died of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]] in 2001.<ref name="Dead"/>

==Legacy==
Widely known and admired in folk music circles,{{fact}}{{weasel-inline}} he gained wider recognition in 1969, when Nilsson's recording of "Everybody's Talkin'" was featured in the film ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', became a hit and won a [[Grammy Award]]. 
He is often called a pioneer of the [[folk rock]] and [[singer-songwriter]] [[musical genre]]s,{{fact}}{{weasel-inline}} his most prominent musical descendants being [[Tim Buckley]], [[Stephen Stills]], [[David Crosby]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].{{fact}} His most frequently cited disciples are [[Karen Dalton]], [[Tim Hardin]], [[Dino Valenti]], [[Vince Martin (singer)|Vince Martin]], [[Peter Stampfel]] of the avant-folk ensemble [[The Holy Modal Rounders]], [[John Sebastian]] ([[The Lovin' Spoonful]]), [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and [[Paul Kantner]] ([[Jefferson Airplane]]).{{fact}} Some of Neil's early compositions were recorded by [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Roy Orbison]]. He was a session guitarist on [[Bobby Darin]]'s 1958 hit "Dream Lover," and a demo singer on a late-1950s Elvis Presley movie soundtrack session.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

In Fred Neil's ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' obituary Anthony DeCurtis wrote, "So why is Neil a hero to David Crosby? Because back when Crosby was an aspiring folkie who just arrived in New York, Neil bothered to take an interest in him, just as he did for the young Bob Dylan, who backed Neil on harmonica at the [[Cafe Wha?]] in Greenwich Village. 'He taught me that everything was music,' Crosby says."

In his memoir, Richie Havens recalled Neil and then-partner [[Vince Martin (singer)|Vince Martin]]'s ability to make an entrance through the audience, sans microphones, and get the audience up and clapping by relying only on their harmonious vocals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
