'''Etang Discher'''  (1908<ref>Per IMDB</ref> - 1981?<ref>no known date of death, last known film was ''Karma'' in 1981. See [http://www.vilmasantos.net/html/karma_review.htm ''Fine Film'', Bob Castillo, People's Journal, 12 December 1981] </ref>) (also known as  '''Nena Discher''')  was a prominent [[Philippines|Filipina]] character film actress frequently cast in villainous roles. Her stern, gaunt Castillan face loomed in many post-war Filipino films, especially [[soap opera]]-type dramas. She was the woman Filipino movie audiences loved to hate, often playing a villainous aunt, mother-in-law or even a witch. While her roles were hardly predisposed to have made her a star, she nonetheless was one of the more famous (or infamous) and durable stars of Filipino films. Many of her films were produced by [[Sampaguita Pictures]], the studio under which she was under contract for a significant part of her career. 

Her son, [[Panchito Alba|Panchito]], became a famous film comedian in his own right, usually cast as the comedic foil to [[Dolphy]].
