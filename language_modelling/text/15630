The '''Broiler industry''' is the process by which [[broiler]] chickens are reared and prepared for meat consumption.

==Broiler industry structure==
The broiler production process is very much an industrial one. There are several distinct components of the broiler supply chain.<ref name="Canada Broiler and Hatching Egg">{{cite web | url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/poultry-volaille/prindc3_eng.htm | title=Poultry Marketplace Profile of The Canadian Chicken Industry (2006) Chapter 3: Broiler and Hatching Egg Segment of the Industry | publisher=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada | year=2006 | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

===Primary breeding sector===
The "primary breeding sector" consists of companies that breed pedigree stock. Pedigree stock ("pure line") is kept on high level biosecure farms. Their eggs are hatched in a special pedigree hatchery and their progeny then goes on to the great grandparent (GGP) and grandparent (GP) generations. These eggs would then go to a special GP hatchery to produce Parent Stock (PS) which passes to the production sector.<ref name="Canada Broiler and Hatching Egg" />

In 2006, out of an estimated world population of 18 billion poultry, about 3% are breeding stock.<ref name="Canada Broiler and Hatching Egg" /> The US supplied about 1/4 of world GP stock.<ref name="Canada Broiler and Hatching Egg" />

Worldwide, the primary sector produced 417 million parent stock (PS) per year.<ref name="Brief History Broiler Selection">{{cite web | url=http://cn.aviagen.com/assets/Sustainability/50-Years-of-Selection-Article-final.pdf | title=A Brief History of Broiler Selection:  How Chicken Became a Global Food Phenomenon in 50 Years | publisher=Aviagen International | accessdate=July 1, 2012 | author=Dominic Elfick}}</ref>

A single pedigree-level hen might have 25000 parent stock bird descendents, which in turn might produce 3 million broilers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cobb-vantress.com/about-cobb/about-cobb | title=About Cobb | publisher=Cobb |accessdate=31 December 2013 | pages=video, about minute 6:30}}</ref>

Numerous techniques are used to assess the pedigree stock. For example, birds might be examined with ultrasound or x-rays to study the shape of muscles and bones. The blood oxygen level is measured to determine cardiovascular health. The walking ability of pedigree candidates is observed and scored.<ref name="90 years">{{cite web | url=http://www.cobb-vantress.com/publications/documents/PubArt_90years.pdf | title=How 90 years of poultry breeding has shaped today<U+2019>s industry | publisher=Poultry International | date=May 2007 | accessdate=July 1, 2012 | author=Hardiman, Dr John}}</ref>

The need for high levels of R&D spending prompted consolidation within the primary breeder industry. By the late 2000s only three sizable breeding groups<ref name="Brief History Broiler Selection" /> remained:

*Aviagen (with the Ross, Arbor Acres, Indian River and Peterson brands)
*Cobb-Vantress (with the Cobb, Avian, Sasso and Hybro brands), and
*Groupe Grimaud (with the Hubbard and Grimaud Frere brands).

In the UK, 2 international firms supply about 90% of the parent stock.<ref name="Structure UK">{{cite web | url=http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/vetsurveillance/documents/commercial-poultry-ind.pdf | title=The Structure of the United Kingdom Poultry Industry | date=June 2006 | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

Due to the high levels of variation in the chicken genome, the industry has not yet reached biological limits to improved performance.<ref name="Brief History Broiler Selection" />

The full chicken [[genome]] was published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], in December 2004. Today, all primary breeding groups are investing heavily in [[genomics]] research. This research mostly focuses on understanding the function and effect of [[genes]] already present in the breeding population. Research into transgenics <U+2014> removing genes or artificially moving genes from one individual or species to another <U+2014> has fewer prospects of gaining favor among consumers.<ref name="Brief History Broiler Selection" />

===Broiler breeder (Parent Stock) farms===
Broiler breeder farms raise parent stock which produce fertilized eggs. A broiler hatching egg is never sold at stores and is not meant for human consumption.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chep-poic.ca/index.html | title=CHEP Wlecome | publisher=Canadian Hatching Egg Producers | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> The males and females are separate genetic lines or breeds.<ref name="Structure UK" /> The chicks they produce will therefore be [[Hybrid (biology)|
hybrids]] or 'crosses'. Since the birds are bred mainly for efficient meat production, producing eggs can be a challenge.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpoultry.net/chickens/breeding/breeders/broiler-breeders-managing-the-paradox-between-reproduction-and-growth-9434.html | title=Broiler breeders: Managing the paradox between reproduction and growth | publisher=WorldPoultry.net | date=11 Oct 2011 | accessdate=June 25, 2012 | author=Meijerhof, Dr. Ron}}</ref> In Canada, the average producer houses 15,000 birds that begin laying hatching eggs at 26 weeks of age. Each bird will lay about 150 hatching eggs for the next 34 to 36 weeks. This cycle is then repeated when the producer puts another flock of 26 week-old birds into his barns to begin the process again. As a general rule, each farmer produces enough broiler hatching eggs to supply chicks for 8 chicken producers.<ref name="About CHEP">{{cite web | url=http://www.chep-poic.ca/about.html | title=About CHEP | publisher=Canadian Hatching Egg Producers | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> (Other sources indicate a parent hen will lay about 180 eggs in 40 week production period.)<ref name="The Only Good Egg">{{cite web | url=http://www.poultry.msstate.edu/extension/pdf/broiler_breeder.pdf | title=The Only Good Broiler Breeder Egg is a Fertilized Egg | publisher=Mississippi State University | accessdate=June 24, 2012 | author=McDaniel, Dr Chris}}</ref>

Generally, parent flocks are either owned by integrated broiler companies or hatcheries or are contracted to them on a long-term basis.<ref name="Structure UK" />

Broiler breeder growing is typically a two-stage process. Parent stock purchased from a primary breeder is delivered as day old. Most are first placed with on specialist ''rearing houses'' or starter farms until approximately 18 weeks of
age.<ref name="Structure UK" /> The starter farm has the specialized brooding equipment to raise the chicks.

====Rearing house====
[[File:Florida chicken house.jpg|right|thumb|Florida chicken house.]]

A typical rearing house (also called a shed or barn) design for Alabama-like climate ({{convert|100|F|C}} in summer and {{convert|20|F|C}} in winter):<ref>{{cite web | url=http://en.aviagen.com/assets/Uploads/Env-MgtRearing.pdf | title=Environmental Management in the Broiler Breeder Rearing House | publisher=Aviagen | year=2005 | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>
*{{convert|40|x|400|ft|m}} size, single [[storey]].
*11,000 bird capacity (about {{convert|1.4|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} per bird)
*Ceiling is insulated
*Exterior curtain side walls.
*A "minimum ventilation" system is required for the heating period to provide a certain amount of fresh air.
*A separate "tunnel ventilation" system with [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative pad cooling]] is desired (minimum wind speed is 400 fpm) for hot weather in the later stage of the bird's growth.
*Air inlets may be automatically adjusted.
*A negative ventilation system helps keep dirt and dust out of egg storage areas.
*The entire house may be heated, or individual "brooders" may be used.
*The floor is flat. There are no "slats" or "pits" for manure. There are no cages, and no nests. "Litter" (shavings or straw) covers the floor. When the chicks are introduced temporary barriers are used to keep them close to the heated areas.
*"Black-out" design to keep out external light, so the day-night cycle can be controlled.
*An automatic timer-controlled lighting system. [[Dimmer]]s allow light intensity to be adjusted.
*Automatic feeders to distribute feed. Typically this consists of an endless chain in a trough<ref>http://www.bigdutchmanusa.com/breederproduction/championchain.html</ref> or with individual pans.<ref>http://www.bigdutchmanusa.com/breederproduction/fluxxbreederpan.html</ref>  A [[silo]] or bin outside provides storage.
*Automatic drinkers provide water. There are several different designs, with "nipples" or "round" drinkers being popular.<ref>http://www.bigdutchmanusa.com/broilerproduction/broilerdrinking.html</ref>
*Feeders and drinkers are height adjusted as the birds grow, and can be raised on chains or wires to allow cleanout of the barn.

Chicks require warm air temperatures, which is reduced as the birds mature:

|}
Chicks might be [[debeaking|debeaked]] at 7<U+2013>10 days age.<ref name="Hubbard Classic PS Mgt" /> During rearing, bird weight is carefully monitored, as an over-weight bird will be a poor egg producer. The feed mix will be adjusted to meet nutritional needs at each stage. Feed might be restricted to control body weight, for example with "skip a day" feeding, or feeding 5 days out of 7. A vaccination program is carried out, which ensures the longevity of the parent stock, and the immunity may be passed to the broiler progeny. Males (cockerels) and females (pullets), are usually raised separately.

====Laying house====
The birds are then moved to broiler breeder ''laying houses'' or production barns. The birds are typically placed into crates,<ref>http://www.strombergschickens.com/prod_detail_list/transportation-coops</ref> and transported by truck to a separate facility. Males and females are raised together at this point. Outwardly the laying house will resemble the rearing house. Inside, about one-half of the floor might consist of raised 'slats.'<ref name="Hubbard Classic PS Mgt" /><ref>http://www.swapinc.com/pdfs/thomas.pdf</ref> During the production run, manure will drop through the slats and accumulate in the pit underneath the slats.  The birds are not generally caged, especially since the [[rooster]]s must mate with the hens to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the eggs. Nests are provided for laying hens. Both automatic and manual [http://www.val-co.com/pdfs/sell_sheets/nesting-containment/12-002_Conventional_Nest.pdf?ValcoPDF=1 (example)] nesting systems exist. Manual nests are usually stuffed with straw or shavings and eggs are hand-collected. Automatic systems usually have a plastic carpet lining, with an belt for egg collection.<ref name="Hubbard Classic PS Mgt" /> Careful layout and attention to bird behavior is required to avoid 'floor eggs'.

Depending on breed, egg production starts at 24<U+2013>26 weeks of age. Production percentage (daily eggs per hen) climbs rapidly to a peak of 80<U+2013>85% at 29<U+2013>32 weeks, and then gradually declines with age. Hatchability tends to peak (at perhaps 90%) somewhat later than production at 34<U+2013>36 weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hubbardbreeders.com/managementguides/index.php?id=14 | title=Classic Parent Stock Performance Summary | publisher=Hubbard LLC | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> Overall flock production will decline as mortality reduces the size of the flock.

When the rooster mates with the hen, sperm enter the hen's oviduct and are stored within sperm storage glands. These glands can store more than half a million sperm, and sperm can remain viable for up to 3 weeks. However, a hen will have maximum fertility for only about 3 to 4 days after one mating. Therefore, the male-to-female ratio in a flock must be enough to ensure mating of every hen every 3 days or so.<ref name="The Only Good Egg" /> To maintain fertility, younger roosters may be introduced as the flock ages.

Eggs are collected a minimum of twice a day, and usually more frequently. Cracked or dirty eggs are separated, as they are not suitable for hatching. Undersized, over-sized or double-yolk eggs are also unsuitable. The eggs might be disinfected by [[fumigation]], are packed in 'flats' or trays, placed in wheeled trolleys, and stored in a cool (15-18C) climate-controlled area. The egg packing room and storage rooms are kept segrated to reduce contamination. The trolleys are delivered by truck to a hatchery perhaps twice a week.

At the end of the production cycle, the birds are called "spent fowl". Disposal of spent fowl may be a problem as consumer demand for them is poor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20061122/NEWS/611220399?p=1&tc=pg | title=Recyling Chickens: Farmers turn to composting amid collapsed spent-hen market | publisher=Press Democrat | date=November 22, 2006 | accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>

===Hatcheries===
[[File:Cornish Rock broiler chicks.JPG|right|thumb|Five day old broiler strain Cornish-Rock chicks.]]
[[Hatchery#Poultry hatcheries|Hatcheries]] take the fertilized eggs, [[Egg incubation|incubate]] them, and produce day old broiler chicks.

Incubation takes about 21 days, and is often a two-step process. Initial incubation is done in [[incubator (egg)|machines]] known as ''setters''. A modern setter is the size of a large room, with a central corridor and racks on either side. Eggs are held relatively tightly (large end up) in trays, which are stored in the racks. Inside the setter, temperature and humidity are closely maintained. Blowers or fans circulate air to ensure uniform temperature, and heating or cooling is applied as needed by automated controls. The racks pivot or tilt from side to side, usually on an hourly basis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dominc.net/Products.htm | title=Dominion Incubators | accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> As an example, one commercial machine can hold up to 124,416 eggs and measures about 4.7 metres wide by 7.2 metres deep.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pasreform.com/products/incubators/315-smartpro-incubation-system.html | title=Pas Reform SmartPro incubation system | publisher=PasReform | accessdate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> Setters often hold more than one hatch, on a staggered hatch-day basis, and operate continuously. The setter phase lasts about 18 days.<ref name="Surehatch">{{cite web | url=http://www.surehatch.co.za/Products-Egg-Incubators-Commercial-Options.htm | title=Surehatch Commercial Egg Incubators <U+2013> An Overview for Entrepreneurs | accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>

On or about day 18, the eggs are removed from the setters and transferred to ''hatchers''. These machines are similar to setters, but have larger flat-bottom trays, so the eggs can rest on their sides, and newly hatched chicks can walk. Having a separate machine helps keep hatching debris out of the setter. The environmental conditions in the hatcher are optimized to help the chicks hatch. As a commercial example, a large hatcher has capacity for 15,840 eggs, and measures about 3.3 metres by 1.8 metres.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chickmaster.com/cm_products_hatchers_CVH.html | title=Chickmaster Classic Hatcher | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

Some incubators are single-stage (combining setter and hatcher funcations), and entire trolleys of eggs can be rolled in at one time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chickmaster.com/cm_products_singlestage_set_sys.html | title=Chickmaster Avida Series Single-Stage Setters | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> One advantage of single-stage machines is that they are thoroughly cleaned after each hatch, whereas a setter is rarely shutdown for cleaning. The single-stage environment can be adjusted for eggs from different producing flocks, and for each step of the hatch cycle. The setter environment is often a compromise as different egg batches are in the machine at one time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

On hatch day (day 21), the trays are removed ("pulled") from the hatchers, and then the chicks are removed from the trays. Chicks are inspected, with the sickly ones being disposed of. Chicks may be by [[Vaccination|vaccinated]], sorted by sex, counted, and placed in chick boxes.[http://www.poultryplast.com/index.asp?site=2&ln=en&p=3&codpro=chickbox1comp (Example1)] [https://www.flickr.com/photos/pasreform/9042855124/in/set-72157644117139594 (Example2)]  Stacks of chick boxes are loaded into trucks for transport, and arrive at the broiler farm on the same day. Specialized climate-controlled trucks are typically used, depending on climate and transport distance.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cobb-vantress.com/publications/documents/CobbTransportationSpotlight_20091012.pdf | title=Cobb Spotlight Transportation | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref>

[[Chick sexing]] is optionally done to improve uniformity <U+2013> since males grow faster, the weights are more uniform if males and females are raised separately. The birds are bred so that males and females have unique feather patterns or color differences. Unlike egg-laying poultry, males are not [[Chick culling|culled]].

Typical hatchability rate in Canada in 2011 was 82.2%.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chep-poic.ca/pdf/Annual_Reports/2011/CHEP_2011AR_e.pdf | title=Canadian Hatching Egg Producers 25 th ANNUAL REPORT 2011 | publisher=Canadian Hatching Egg Producers | accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> (i.e. 82.2% of eggs set for incubation produced a saleable chick). A UK source estimates 90% hatchability.

===Broiler farms===
The chicks are delivered to the actual broiler ''Grow-Out'' farms.
{{expand section|date=June 2012}}
In the US, houses may be up to 60' x 600' (36000 sq.ft.).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mountaire.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=trees.pageDetails&p=121-17-229 | title=Poultry House Construction: The Big House | publisher=Mountaire | accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> One 2006 magazine survey reported a desired 67 foot wide house, with the average 'standard' new house being 45' x 493', with largest being 60' x 504'.<ref name="Watt 2006 Survey">{{cite web | url=http://www.wattpoultryusa-digital.com/wattpoultryusa/200606?pg=30#pg30 | title=2006 Live Production Survey: Housing Expansion Plans | publisher=Watt Poultry USA | date=June 2006 | accessdate=September 3, 2012 | author=O'Keefe, Terrence; Thorton, Gary | pages=26<U+2013>30}}</ref> One farm complex may have several houses.

In Mississippi, typical farms now have four to six houses with 25,000 birds per house. One full-time worker might manage three houses. On average, a new broiler house is about 500 feet long by 44 feet wide and costs about $200,000 equipped.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://old.thepoultrysite.com/articles/2495/the-mississippi-poultry-industry-and-its-economic-impact | title=The Mississippi Poultry Industry and its Economic Impact | publisher=The Poultry Site | date=May 2012 | accessdate=September 3, 2012}}</ref>

When the birds are full-grown, they are caught (perhaps with a [[Chicken harvester]]) placed in crates, and transported by truck to a processing plant.

[[File:Broiler Chicken kept outside of a Chicken Shop in India.jpg|thumb|Broiler chickens kept outside near a chicken shop in India]]
Because of their efficient meat conversion, broiler chickens are also popular in small [[family farms]] in rural communities, where a family will raise a small flock of broilers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Processing plants===
When the birds are large enough, they are shipped to processing plants for slaughter. When chickens arrive at the processor they go through the following sequence:<ref name="Meat chicken farm sequence">{{cite web | url=http://www.poultryhub.org/anatomy-and-physiology/meat-chicken-farm-sequence/ | title=Meat chicken farm sequence (processing) | publisher=Poultry Hub | date=20 August 2010 | accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref>
* Removed from transport cages
* Hung by the legs on a shackle, mounted on a conveyor chain.
* Stunned using an electrically charged water bath
* Killed by cutting the blood vessels in the neck
* Bled so that most blood has left the carcass
* Scalded to soften the attachment of the feathers
* Plucked to remove the feathers
* Head removed
* Hock cutting to remove the feet
* Rehung in the evisceration room
* Gutted or eviscerated to remove the internal organs
* Washed to remove blood and soiling from the carcass
* Chilled to prevent bacterial spoiling (They go through a chiller which takes approximately 2 hours to go through. The chiller generally holds thousands of gallons of water  kept below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.) 
* Drained to allow excess water to drip off the carcass
* Weighing
* Cut selection to divide the carcass into desired portion (breast, drumsticks etc.)
* Packed (for example in plastic bags) to protect carcasses or cuts
* Chilled or frozen for preservation

Further Processing plants carry out operations such as cutting and deboning.
Previously the conveyor belts carrying live chickens generally ran at a maximum of 140 chickens per minute, but the maximum speed has been increased to 175 birds/minute.  Once the dead birds arrive in the evisceration room (usually dropped down a chute after the feet are removed), they are hung again on shackles much the same way as they were when they were alive.

===Feed Mills===
{{expand section|date=June 2012}}

===Integrators===
Today, in the U.S. an individual company called an "integrator" performs all or most production aspects. Integrators generally own breeder flocks, hatcheries, feed mills, and processing plants. The integrators provide the chicks, feed, medication, part of the fuel for brooding, and technical advisers to supervise farm production. Integration reduces costs by coordinating each stage of production.<ref name="Contract Broiler Prod Q&A" />

===US industry history===
In the 1920s<U+2013>1930s, broiler production was initiated in locations such as the [[Delmarva Peninsula]], Georgia, Arkansas, and New England. [[First Broiler House|Mrs. Wilmer Steele]] of Sussex County, Delaware, is often cited as the pioneer of the commercial broiler industry. In 1923, she raised a flock of 500 chicks intended to be sold for meat. Her business was so profitable that by 1926 she was able to build a 10,000 bird broiler house.

In 1945, [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company|A&P]] organized the first of its <U+201C>Chicken of Tomorrow<U+201D> contests. Qualifying trials were conducted in 1946 and 1947 with the national finals held in 1948. Breeders submitted a case of 30 dozen hatching eggs to a hatchery, the eggs were hatched, the offspring raised until they reached market weight and were then slaughtered. Broilers were judged on several factors, including growth rate, feed conversion efficiency, and the amount of meat on breasts and drumsticks. Though held only three times, the contests enabled breeders such as Peterson, Vantress, Cobb, Hubbard, Pilch and Arbor Acres to become established market brands.<ref name="Brief History Broiler Selection" />

During the 1940s <U+2013> 1960s, [[compound feed|feed mills]], [[hatchery|hatcheries]], farms, and [[meat packing industry|processors]] were all separate entities. Hatcheries were driven to co-ordinate activities to protect their market share and production. Later, feed mills extended credit to farmers to purchase feed to produce the live chickens. Eventually entrepreneurs consolidated feed mill, hatchery and processing operations, resulting in the beginnings of the integrated industry.

Chickens were typically sold <U+201C>New York dressed,<U+201D> with only the blood and feathers removed. In 1942, an Illinois plant was the first to win government approval of <U+201C>on-line<U+201D> evisceration. Evisceration and ice-packing of ready-to-cook whole carcasses became the norm. In 1949, [[united States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] launched a voluntary program of grading. Federal inspection of broilers became mandatory in 1959.

By 1952, <U+201C>broilers<U+201D> surpassed farm chickens as the number one source of chicken meat in the United States.

By the mid-1960s, ninety percent of broilers produced came from [[vertical integration|vertical integrated operations]], which combined production, processing and marketing.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, major companies used television and print media to market chickens under [[brand]] names. Today, 95 percent of broilers sold at retail grocery stores carry a brand name.

By the early 1980s, consumers preferred cut-up and further-processed chickens to the traditional whole bird.

Chicken passed pork consumption in 1985. Chicken consumption surpassed beef consumption in 1992.<ref name="NCC About The Industry">{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/history/ | title=National Chicken Council: History | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>

====Breeders====
'''Cobb''' claims to be world's oldest poultry breeding company. Founded 1916 when Robert C. Cobb Senior purchased a farm in [[Littleton, Massachusetts]], forming Cobb<U+2019>s Pedigreed Chicks. Purchased by [[Upjohn]] in 1974. Sold to [[Tyson Foods]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cobb-vantress.com/about-cobb/our-history | title=Our History | publisher=Cobb | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

'''Hubbard''' was founded by Oliver Hubbard in 1921 in [[Walpole, New Hampshire]]. Acquired by [[Merck & Co.|Merck]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hubbardbreeders.com/ | title=Hubbard Home Page | publisher=Hubbard | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> In 1997 Hubbard was spun off and merged with the ISA-group from France as part of [[Merial]].

'''Arbor Acres''' was originally a family farm, started by Italian immigrant Frank Saglio who purchased a [[Glastonbury, Connecticut]] farm in 1917. He started raising chickens in abandoned piano crates. His third son Henry Saglio took over the poultry while in grade eight. Henry began trying to breed a white bird, because black pinfeathers were difficult to pluck. In 1948, and again in 1951, Arbor Acres White Rocks won in the purebred category of the Chicken of Tomorrow competition. The white feathered Arbor Acres birds were preferred to the higher performing dark feathered Red Cornish crosses. In 1964, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] purchased Arbor Acres making it part of International Basic Economy Corporation (IBEC). Joint ventures were formed in Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, and Japan. In 1980, IBEC merged with Booker McConnell Limited of Great Britain. Booker owned all of "AA" by 1991. At this time Arbor Acres had grown to become the world's largest broiler breeding company, with customers in over 70 countries. AA was divested in 2000, eventually acquired by Avigen.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/21/us/henry-saglio-92-father-of-poultry-industry.html | title=Henry Saglio, 92, 'Father' of Poultry Industry | publisher=New York Times | date=December 21, 2003 | accessdate=31 December 2013 |author=O'Connor, Anahad}}</ref><ref name="COTCOW">{{cite web | url=http://www.iatp.org/blog/201303/how-the-chicken-of-tomorrow-became-the-chicken-of-the-world |title=How the Chicken of Tomorrow became the Chicken of the World | publisher=Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy | date=March 26, 2013 | accessdate=31 December 2013 | author=Wiehoff, Dale}}</ref><ref name="Saglio HSGCT">{{cite web | url=http://www.hsgct.org/industry.htm | title=Early Glastonbury Industry: The Father of the Modern Poultry Industry | publisher=The Historical Society of Glastonbury | year=2006 | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19820914&id=bDFJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uAYNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1221,2685248 | title=Arbor Acres Farms Counts Chicks Before They Hatch | publisher=The Hour - Norwalk CT | date=Sep 14, 1982 | accessdate=31 December 2013 | author=Johnson Maria}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/6053/poultry-industry-pioneer-henry-saglio-dies-at-age-92 | title=Poultry industry pioneer Henry Saglio dies at age 92 | publisher=The Poultry Site | date=15 December 2003 | accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.answers.com/topic/booker-cash-carry-ltd-2 | title=Booker Group PLC | publisher=Answers.com | date=March 2013 | accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref>

'''Shaver''' started with 2 hens in 1932 by [[Donald Shaver]]. Mainly focused on laying hens, Shaver launched a broiler product in 1958. [[Cargill]] purchased part of Shaver in 1964, which helped give Shaver a toehold in the US market. In early 1970<U+2019>s the market share in the US was around 8-10%. Cargill bought all of Shaver in 1985. Shaver was acquired by ISA in 1988, and then made part of Merial. The layer business kept the Shaver name, and was sold as Natexis Industrie in 2003, and then to Hendrix in 2005.<ref name="Hendrix Shaver">{{cite web | url=http://www.hendrix-genetics.com/en/about-us/history/institut-selection-animal-bv-isa/shaver/~/media/Files/ISA/History/History%20of%20Shaver%20Breeding%20Farms%20Ltd%20Canada.ashx | title=The History of Shaver Breeding Farms | publisher=Hendrix Genetics | year=2010 | accessdate=31 December 2013 | author=Smith, Kingsley}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FIAQiup2oz4J:en.engormix.com/MA-poultry-industry/news/france-hendrix-genetics-acquires-t8270/p0.htm+&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca | title=France - Hendrix Genetics Acquires Compagnie Internationale de Volailles/Institut de S<U+00E9>lection Animale | publisher=Hendrix Poultry Breeders | date=2005-12-16 | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

===Canada===
Canada has a supply management system where [[marketing board]]s govern the broiler and broiler hatching egg industries. For broilers, prices are negotiated at the provincial level. In each province, the minimum price per kg that processors will pay to producers is set periodically through negotiations between processors and the provincial marketing board.  From 1992 to 2003, negotiated prices in Ontario are generally used as a benchmark when conducting price negotiations in other provinces. In Ontario, Chicken Farmers of Ontario (CFO) has price-negotiating authority. It negotiates the base price paid by primary processors for live chicken with primary processors. Since 2003, the live chicken price is determined by a <U+201C>live price formula<U+201D> established by the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs Appeals Tribunal that includes the price of chicks, feed and producer margin.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" />

Broiler hatching egg production consists of 270 producers generating about $188.3 million in 2005. Canada produced about 675 million hatching eggs, and imported about 121 million.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" />

There were 66 hatcheries in Canada, of which 20 were mixed, producing both broiler and layer chicks.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" /> The main companies involved in broiler hatching eggs and chicks are:
*[[Maple Leaf Foods]] Incorporated,
*Lilydale Hatchery,
*Maple Lodge,
*Couvoir Boire & Fr<U+00E8>res Inc
*Western Hatchery Limited.
The average price per chick was about $0.35. Canada imported about 13 million broiler chicks.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" />

There were 2786 regulated chicken producers, generating farm cash receipts of $1.6 billion in 2005. Compared to other livestock sectors (i.e. beef, dairy, and pork), the poultry and egg industry was the healthiest with regards to total income for the average operator.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" />

In 2005, total chicken slaughters were 973.9 million kilograms. Of this, 35.2 million kg were mature (non-broiler)slaughters, meaning about 96% of chicken consumption was broilers. By revenue, chicken processing is about 1/4 of the meat packing business. The top 8 processors account 66% of the market.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" />

In 2005 there were 175 primary poultry processing plants.<ref name="Profile of the Canadian Chicken Industry 2006" /> The five largest firms are, in order:
# la Coop<U+00E9>rative f<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>e de Qu<U+00E9>bec (three plants in Qu<U+00E9>bec),
# Lilydale Poultry Co-operative (one plant in British Columbia, three in Alberta and one in Saskatchewan),
# [[Maple Leaf Foods|Maple Leaf Poultry]] (two plants in Ontario, one in Alberta and one in Nova Scotia),
# Exceldor (two plants in Qu<U+00E9>bec) and
# Maple Lodge Farms (one plant in Ontario).
There are 376 plants that do further processing, involving canning, boning and cutting.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), is a branch of [[Health Canada]] whose role is to enforce the [[food safety]], to ensure animal health, to set standards and carry out enforcement and inspection. Activities range from the inspection of federally registered meat processing facilities to border inspections for foreign pests and diseases, to the enforcement of practices related to fraudulent labelling. The CFIA also verifies the humane transportation of animals, conducts food investigations and recalls, and performs laboratory testing and environmental feeds.<ref name="Ag Canada Poultry Marketplace FAQ">{{cite web | url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/poultry-volaille/faq_eng.htm | title=Poultry Marketplace FAQ | publisher=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada | accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>

The Canadian On-Farm Food Safety Program (COFFSP) is directed by producers. It is a science-based, credible program consistent with the [[Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points]] (HACCP, "hass ap") standards, managed by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture.<ref name="Ag Canada Poultry Marketplace FAQ" />
