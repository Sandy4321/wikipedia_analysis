'''North Carolina Highway 162''' ('''NC&nbsp;162''') is a primary [[state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[North Carolina]].  The highway serves as an alternate route to [[North Carolina Highway 59]], by bypassing downtown [[Hope Mills, North Carolina|Hope Mills]].

==Route description==
NC&nbsp;162 is a short road being only 7.5 miles. It is intended to be a bypass for NC&nbsp;59.  The road begins at [[U.S. Route 401 in North Carolina|US&nbsp;401]], near the Lafayette Shopping Center.  After crossing NC&nbsp;59, it bypasses [[Hope Mills, North Carolina|Hope Mills]] to its north, ending at [[Interstate 95 Business (Fayetteville, North Carolina)|I-95 Bus]] and [[U.S. Route 301 in North Carolina|US&nbsp;301]]. 

==History==
The second and current NC&nbsp;162 was established in 2007 as a new primary routing that was signed on George Owen Road, between Fisher Road and Camden Road, crossing NC&nbsp;59.  In 2009, it was extended to its current western terminus with US&nbsp;401 (Raeford Road), via Bingham Drive and Bunce Road.  In 2011, it was extended east, from Camden Road to Legion Road.  In 2013, after widening and other improvements on Elk Road, NC&nbsp;162 was extended west, along Elk Road, to its current terminus with I-95 Bus/US&nbsp;301, completing the Hope Mills bypass.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] |url= https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Route%20Changes/2009_02_11.pdf |format= PDF |title= NC Route Changes (2009-02-11)|date= February 11, 2009 |accessdate= November 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation |url= https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Route%20Changes/2011_10_04.pdf |format= PDF |title= NC Route Changes (2011-10-04)|date= October 4, 2011 |accessdate= November 23, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |publisher= North Carolina Department of Transportation |url= https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Route%20Changes/2013_03_28.pdf |format= PDF |title= NC Route Changes (2013-03-28)|date= March 28, 2013 |accessdate= November 23, 2013}}</ref>

The first NC&nbsp;162 was established in 1937, as a renumbering of [[North Carolina Highway 161|NC&nbsp;161]].  It traversed from [[North Carolina Highway 16|NC&nbsp;16]], in [[Warrensville, North Carolina|Warrensville]], to Rugby Road, at the [[Virginia]] state line.  In 1953, the entire route was renumbered as part of [[North Carolina Highway 194|NC&nbsp;194]].
