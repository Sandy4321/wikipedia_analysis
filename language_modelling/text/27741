'''Waymarking''' is an activity in which people can locate and log interesting locations around the world, usually with a [[GPS]] receiver and a [[digital camera]]. Waymarking differs from [[geocaching]] in that there is no physical container to locate at the given coordinates. Waymarking identifies points of interest for GPS users. There are many categories of waymarks, from pay phones through various restaurant chains, covered bridges, churches, places where one can take a factory tour and places of geologic significance, to name only a few.  {{As of|2010|4|15|df=US}}, there were over a 1000 different categories.

Participation in waymarking leads some to become more knowledgeable of their own areas and to become interested in local history.  Others have developed games (such as "What's in a Name?") that require the assistance of other players in remote areas.<ref>[http://dwb.thenewstribune.com/soundlife/story/6447193p-5744266c.html Craig Hill, "Waymarking: The latest GPS game: Who are those people scoping out your neighborhood?"

Waymarking is also used as a term to describe creating a walking, cycling, or other route which is traveled by following a specific symbol ('waymark', sometimes 'way-mark' or 'way mark') along the route. These waymarks sometimes follow the route in one direction, or in other cases allow a route to be followed in both directions.  One example is the standardized sign posted along the [[49-Mile Scenic Drive]] in [[San Francisco, California]], which can be started at any point along the route.

Retailers sometimes also use waymarkers to draw motorists to the location of their store or car park. A similar process is also used by local fairs, fates or even firework nights. The signs are typically posters strapped to railings or lampposts but sometimes the standard symbol is used.
