'''Libertarianism in the United Kingdom''' is a political movement concerned with the pursuit of [[libertarian]] ideals in the United Kingdom. While not as prominent as in the [[United States]], after the 1980s and the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] the libertarian movement became more prominent in British politics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/jason_walsh/2006/04/libertarianism_left_behind.html |title=Libertarianism limited |accessdate=2008-02-26 |last=Walsh |first=Jason |date=7 April 2006 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] }}</ref>

==Political parties==
Most prominent libertarian politicians are in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], where libertarianism has formed a significant part, particularly since [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s premiership.  Under [[Iain Duncan Smith]]'s leadership of the party, dissatisfaction with the direction of the party led to talk of a split, with the secession of the libertarian faction - including as many as 50 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] - and the creation of a separate libertarian party.<ref>{{cite news |first=Benedict |last=Brogan |title=Young Tories talk of split unless party is reformed |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1404283/Young-Tories-talk-of-split-unless-party-is-reformed.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 August 2002 |accessdate=2008-07-15 }}</ref> However, this did not materialise.

Nonetheless, smaller parties have attempted to attract libertarians.  The [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP) has attempted to break out of its image as a [[single-issue party]] by developing into a more rounded libertarian party, with it being construed as an attempt to outflank the Conservatives on economic issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/torydiary/2006/01/ukip_prepare_to.html |title=UKIP prepare to attack Tories from libertarian right |accessdate=2008-02-26 |last=Montgomerie |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Montgomerie |date=15 January 2006 |publisher=[[ConservativeHome]] }}</ref>

The Libertarian Party is a political party in the United Kingdom that promotes libertarian policies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpuk.org/ |title=The UK Libertarian Party - Welcome |accessdate=2008-06-15 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=}}</ref>.  It was founded on 1 January 2008 under the leadership of Patrick Vessey who registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 21 November 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&frmPartyID=804&frmType=partydetail |title=Register of Political Parties Libertarian Party |accessdate=2008-07-15 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=}}</ref>.  The party has attracted particular interest in the [[blogosphere]]. The party's first policy announcement, to abolish [[Income tax in the United Kingdom|income tax]], came on 3 March 2008.

The Libertarian Party intended to run a candidate, blogger and management consultant Ian Parker-Joseph, in the [[Henley by-election, 2008|Henley by-election]] on 26 June 2008, marking the party's electoral debut.<ref name="ThameNewsElection">{{cite news |title= New party for fight Henley seat  |publisher=Thame News |url=http://www.thamenews.net/readmore.asp?Content_ID=3399& |accessdate=2008-06-06 }}</ref>, but he did not in fact stand<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ianpj4mp.blogspot.com/2008/06/henley-on-thames-by-election-withdrawal.html |title=Henley-on-Thames by-election withdrawal |accessdate=2008-06-12 |last=Parker-Joseph |first=Ian |date=2008-06-11 |publisher=}}</ref>. [[Alex Singleton]] has criticized the Libertarian Party on the grounds that minor parties can't win, and accuses the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|U. S. Libertarian Party]] of "undermining liberty."<ref>
{{cite web |last=Singleton |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Singleton |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/politics/threelinewhip/may/how-libertarians-undermine-liberty.html |title=How Libertarians undermine liberty |publisher=''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' |accessdate=2008-06-09 }} </ref>

Among other activities, the party began an awareness campaign, organizing to give a copy of [[George Orwell]]'s dystopian novel, ''[[Nineteen-Eighty Four]]'' to every sitting member of the [[House of Commons]] to highlight the party's concern about the erosion of [[civil liberties]] within the United Kingdom.

On 17 September 2008 Patrick Vessey resigned as party leader and was replaced by Ian Parker-Joseph<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lpuk.blogspot.com/2008/09/libertarian-party-leadership.html |title=Libertarian Party Leadership |accessdate=2008-09-20 |date=2008-09-17 |publisher=}}</ref>.<br>

The party fielded candidate Andrew Hunt, for the Wisbech South division of Cambridgeshire County Council in the town of [[Wisbech]]<ref>http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/council/democracy/elections/elections2009/candidatesandresults/</ref>. He received 140 votes (6.98%).

===Accounts===

Annual accounts held by the Electoral Commission <ref>[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/_media/statement-of-accounts/2009/Libertarian-Party-SOA-2008.pdf Libertarian Party Accounts]</ref> show that they had 314 members at the end of 2008, and a net annual income of <U+00A3>3,395.

==Libertarian think tanks==
There are a number of think tanks that are explicitly libertarian or espouse libertarian views.  The [[Libertarian Alliance]] works to promote libertarianism generally, and holds no corporate view beyond that, allying together [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[minarchism|minarchists]], [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] and even [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]].  The [[Society for Individual Freedom]], from which the Libertarian Alliance originally split, works as a broader alliance, incorporating both libertarians less radical free-market conservatives.

The [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] (IEA) is the oldest free-market think tank in the United Kingdom, and a progenitor of a large network of libertarian think tanks around the world, as well as greatly shaping the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] government's economic policies.  The [[Centre for Policy Studies]] was set up by Thatcher and [[Keith Joseph]] for the purpose of advancing [[classical liberalism]].  The [[Adam Smith Institute]] promotes the work of [[Adam Smith]] in explaining the working of the free market from a libertarian viewpoint.

There are a few libertarian student societies at British universities, including  [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], [[Imperial College London]], [[London School of Economics]] (the [[Hayek Society]]), [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University College London]], and [[University of Warwick|Warwick]].
