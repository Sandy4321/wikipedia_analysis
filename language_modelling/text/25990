'''Benjamin Scott "Ben" Folds''' (born September 12, 1966) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], record producer, and television personality. From 1995-2000, Folds was the [[frontman]] and [[pianist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Ben Folds Five]]. Since the group disbanded, Folds has performed as a solo artist and has toured all over the world. He has also collaborated with musicians such as [[William Shatner]], [[Regina Spektor]] and [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] and undertaken experimental songwriting projects with authors such as [[Nick Hornby]] and [[Neil Gaiman]]. In addition to contributing music to the soundtracks of the animated films ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]],'' and ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'', Folds produced [[Amanda Palmer]]'s first solo album and has been a judge on the [[NBC]] [[a cappella]] singing contest ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sing Off|url=http://www.nbc.com/sing-off/exclusives/ben-folds/|work=About the Show|publisher=NBC|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}</ref> 

==Early life and career==
Folds became interested in piano at age nine.  His father, a carpenter, brought one home through a barter trade with a customer who was unable to pay.<ref>According to Ben Folds on his iTunes Originals interview titled "My Inner White Man Came Out In Full Bloom"</ref> During this time, Folds listened to songs by [[Elton John]] and [[Billy Joel]] on [[AM radio]], and learned them by ear. During his years at [[R.J. Reynolds High School]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], Folds played in several bands as the pianist, [[bassist]], or [[drummer]].

In the late 1980s, Folds (as a bassist) and longtime friend [[Millard Powers]] formed the band [[Majosha]]. The group released several locally produced records. They played their first gig at [[Duke University]]'s [[Battle of the Bands]] in 1988, and won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.duke.edu/node/149129 |title=Ben Folds headlines annual LDOC festivities &#124; The Chronicle |publisher=Chronicle.duke.edu |date=2009-04-15 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> They played at bars and [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] parties, and eventually put out a self-produced [[Extended play|EP]], which was sold at a few local stores called ''Party Night: Five Songs About Jesus'' (1988). The record featured only four songs, with none of them actually being about [[Jesus]].  They recorded ''[[Shut Up and Listen to Majosha]]'' in 1989. It contains, among other tracks, the four songs from ''Party Night'' (remixed and/or re-recorded) and what Folds would later record with his own band ("Emaline" and "Video"). At about the same time, they did a dance mix of "Get That Bug" that was released in [[Japan]].

Majosha broke up in early 1990, and Folds formed ''Pots and Pans'' with [[Evan Olson]] (bass) and [[Snuzz|Britt "Snuzz" Uzzell]] (guitar and vocals), where Folds played drums.  The newly formed band lasted only about a month, after which Olson and Uzzell went on to form Bus Stop<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.8notes.com/biographies/ben_folds.asp |title=Ben Folds biography |publisher=8notes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> with Folds' brother, Chuck Folds, on bass, and Eddie Walker on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshrubbery.com/0798/music2.html |title=Bus Stop - Self Titled |publisher=Theshrubbery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

Folds eventually got a music publishing deal with Nashville music executive [[Scott Siman]] who saw Folds open for musician Marc Silvey (as well as playing bass for Silvey's band Mass Confusion), and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue it in 1990. He played drums for a short stint in Jody's Power Bill, headed by [[Millard Powers]], [[Owsley (musician)|Will Owsley]], and [[Jody Spence]]. Jody's Power Bill was later renamed [[The Semantics]]. Folds did not take a creative role in the band. He, again, attracted interest from major labels. He ended up playing drums there as a [[session musician]].<ref name="Winston-Salem">[http://fmaynard.com/bff/reviews/winston_salem.html Ben Folds Five - Winston-Salem Journal review]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

"In Nashville, I was running eight miles a day, hanging out with my friends, walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums, which I enjoyed. Life was easy. I was never frustrated <U+2013> even though I wasn't fulfilling my contract obligations. If you are failing in Nashville, at least your standard of living is nice. Nashville is a nice way to fail."<ref name="Winston-Salem"/>

Folds attended the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Frost School of Music]] on a percussion scholarship, but dropped out with one credit to go before graduating. He devoted a lot of time to working on piano technique. "I spent maybe six months just running scales with a metronome like a freak," Folds said. "I suppose that did something."<ref>{{cite web

Folds tells audiences about a jury recital when he was a student at the University of Miami<U+2019>s music school. A jury recital consists of playing a prepared repertoire (and sometimes unprepared pieces from prior years of training) before faculty members who apply a grade for the entire semester. Folds, a drummer, showed up with a broken hand from defending his room mate from bullies the night before, but was required to play anyway.  He ended up losing his scholarship and in desperation threw his drum kit into the campus' Lake Osceola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www99.epinions.com/content_77450677892 |title=Ben Folds Bares All Live - Ben Folds Live [PA&#93; - Ben Folds - Epinions.com |publisher=9.epinions.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

After leaving Miami, Folds moved to Montclair, New Jersey and  began to act in theater troupes in New York City.  He enjoyed it in 1993 to the point where he didn't want to keep pursuing a musical career.<ref name="Winston-Salem"/>  He also played weekly gigs at [[Sin-<U+00E9>]], famous for being the cafe which had helped start [[Jeff Buckley]]'s career.

Soon after, Folds moved back to [[North Carolina]]. The [[Trio (music)|trio]] of Folds, bassist [[Robert Sledge]], and drummer [[Darren Jessee]] formed [[Ben Folds Five]] in 1994<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/folds_ben/bio.jhtml VH1 Bio]</ref> in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]]. As Folds put it, <U+201C>[[Jeff Buckley]] was being signed at that time by [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and I was talking to Steve, his [[A&R]] guy, and somehow we knew the same people or something."

==Ben Folds Five==
In 1995, [[Ben Folds Five]] released their self-titled [[Ben Folds Five (album)|debut album]]. The debut was followed by ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]]'' in 1997, and the odds-and-ends compilation ''[[Naked Baby Photos]]'' was released in early 1998. ''Whatever and Ever Amen'' spawned many singles such as "[[Brick (song)|Brick]]", "Song for the Dumped", and "Battle of Who Could Care Less". In 1999, the band released their final album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]'', which included the hit, "[[Army (song)|Army]]".

Folds has described his former band as "[[punk rock]] for sissies",<ref>{{cite news|last = Thomas |first = Sarah |title = Ben Folds with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra |publisher = Sydney Morning Herald |date = 2006-08-25 |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/ben-folds-with-the-sydney-symphony/2006/08/25/1156012707758.html |accessdate = 2006-09-23 }}</ref> and his oddball lyrics often contain nuances of melancholy, self conflict, and humorous sarcasm, often punctuated by profanity.

Despite its presence on multiple ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' genre charts, no Ben Folds Five singles reached the US [[Hot 100]], although they did show well on both adult contemporary and modern [[rock music|rock]] charts. However they gained a strong following in the United Kingdom and [[Australia]] early in their career, and like many other 'alternative' American acts this was largely thanks to consistent support from national broadcasters in those countries, the [[BBC]] in Britain and the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC's]] [[Triple J]] youth radio network in Australia (and ABC-TV's music video show ''[[Rage (TV program)|Rage]]'').

The group's first chart breakthrough came in the UK, when "Underground" made the lower reaches of the Top 40, peaking at #37. Britain was the Five's strongest territory in terms of chart success, with five singles making the national Top 40 there <U+2013> "Underground", "Battle of Who Could Care Less", "Kate", "Brick" and "Army" <U+2013> although none managed to crack the UK Top 20.

In Australia "Underground" likewise broke the band locally and while it did not make the ARIA chart, it came in at #3 the 1998 Triple J Hottest 100 poll. The 1998 single "Brick" became the group's only major chart placing in Australia, reaching #13; it also came in at #53 in the [[Australian Record Industry Association|ARIA]] Australian Top 100 for that year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-end-of-year-charts-top-100-singles-1998.htm |title=ARIA Charts - End Of Year Charts - Top 100 Singles 1998 |publisher=Aria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> and earned a Gold Record award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-singles-1998.htm |title=ARIA Charts - Accreditations - 1998 Singles |publisher=Aria.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref> while its parent album ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]]'' peaked at #9 and charted for 32 weeks.

Folds and his bandmates have moved many albums since 2001. He said, "The songs have been getting a great reaction, it makes me look forward to having a new [[album]] out there because it<U+2019>s been a while. This feels like a really free period in my life and I<U+2019>m really enjoying it.<U+201D><ref>http://www.benfolds.com/biography{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>
Ben Folds Five reunited to perform its first concert appearance in nearly 10 years on September 18, 2008 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]'s Memorial Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A263732 |title=Ben Folds Five to perform in Chapel Hill |accessdate=2008-09-02 |last=Currin |first=Grayson |date=2008-09-02 |publisher=Independent Weekly }}</ref> The one-off gig was part of the [[MySpace]] "Front to Back" series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its final album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]''. The concert aired during October and can be viewed at Nowwhat.com.<ref>The Suburbs.co.uk: [http://www.thesuburbs.org.uk/news/Did_You_Just_Shit_Your_Pants__Cause_I_Sure_Did_Ben_Folds_Five_Reunion/ "Did You Just Shit Your Pants?

==Solo career==
[[File:Ben Folds, Knoxville, 1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Folds performing in Knoxville, Tennessee (2006)]]
As of 2008, Folds had released six [[Solo album|solo]] [[LP album|LPs]], including an experimental side project called ''[[Fear of Pop]]'', which was released while [[Ben Folds Five]] was still together.

Folds's first solo release after the breakup of the band was ''[[Rockin' the Suburbs]]'' in 2001.  He played nearly all the instruments, notably [[guitar]] (an instrument seldom used during the Ben Folds Five days). ''The Luckiest'' was written for the Amy Heckerling movie ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'', but the scene it was meant for was deleted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=9403 |title=Song Facts: "The Luckiest" |author=Song Facts |date=8/23/2010 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}</ref>  [[Millard Powers]], [[Snuzz|Britt "Snuzz" Uzzell]], and [[Jim Bogios]] joined him on the promotional tour of the album.  [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] directed and appeared in Folds' video for "[[Rockin' the Suburbs]]".  Folds' friend and fellow musician [[John McCrea (musician)|John McCrea]], lead singer of the band [[Cake (band)|Cake]], contributed vocals to Folds' song "Fred Jones, Part 2".

A year later, he released ''[[Ben Folds Live]]'', a collection of live solo recordings. In late 2003, two solo [[Extended play|EPs]], ''[[Speed Graphic (EP)|Speed Graphic]]'' and ''[[Sunny 16 (EP)|Sunny 16]]'', were released.  The last EP, ''[[Super D]]'', was released in mid-2004.

''[[Songs for Silverman]]'' was released in the United States on April 26, 2005. The album featured Jared Reynolds on [[Bass guitar|bass]] and Lindsay Jamieson on [[Drum kit|drums]], thus returning to the trio format. This album includes the track "Late", a tribute to the late singer-songwriter [[Elliott Smith]], and also features [[backup vocals]] from [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] on "Time" (Folds had played piano for Yankovic's song "Why Does This Always Happen to Me?" on his ''[[Poodle Hat]]'' album).

Folds contributed to [[William Shatner]]'s album, ''[[Has Been]]'', as [[Record producer|producer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], musician, and [[backup vocalist]].  Shatner was also involved in Folds' ''Fear of Pop'' project, and contributed vocals to a number of songs on the album.

The [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack]] for the 2006 [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' featured "Red is Blue," performed by Ben Folds.

In May 2006, Folds contributed three original songs to the soundtrack of ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', dubbed "Heist," "Family of Me," and "Still."  Included with them was a cover of [[The Clash]] song "Lost in the Supermarket" and a remix of "Rockin' The Suburbs."  "Rockin' the Suburbs" featured new lyrics written to complement the script of the film.

On October 24, 2006, Folds released ''[[Supersunnyspeedgraphic|Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the LP]]'', a compilation of songs that were originally released on the EPs ''Sunny 16'', ''Speed Graphic'', and ''Super D''. He announced on his [[MySpace]] blog that he planned to work on his next [[studio album]] in October 2006 (although recording did not actually start until 2007).  On that same day, Folds became the first person to broadcast a live concert over [[MySpace]]. The concert was complete with pranks staged ahead of time by Folds, including a drunk man falling over the balcony during "Jesusland" and a suicide attempt at the end. The concert is also notable for featuring a "guitorchestra", a group of acoustic guitarists from Nashville who accompanied Folds on some songs, as well as an impromptu ringtone orchestra made up of audience memebers playing their cellphone's ringtones in unison.

Folds produced [[The Dresden Dolls]]' [[Amanda Palmer]]'s first solo album, ''[[Who Killed Amanda Palmer]]'' which was released September 16, 2008. He also performs on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/04/070425_apalmer |title=Dresden Doll Preps Solo Debut &#124; Spin Magazine Online |publisher=Spin.com |date=2007-04-25 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshadowbox.net/ddbb/viewtopic.php?p=356594&highlight=#356594 |title=View topic - Speculation: Solo Album Title |publisher=Theshadowbox.Net |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

During a concert at the National in Richmond, Virginia on April 11, 2008, Folds announced that he had completed his newest album, and played four new tracks from this album. He played the first track, "Hiroshima", at the same show in Richmond on April 11. He also debuted new music at an impromptu gig at the [[Exit/In]] on December 19, 2007 and at the Ann Arbor Folk Festival on January 25, 2008. Other new songs include "Errant Dog", "Effington", "Bitch Went Nuts", "Free Coffee", and "Kylie From Connecticut". Folds played The 6th annual Langerado on March 8, 2008 and was a part of the lineup for the 2008 [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]].

On July 16, 2008, an anonymous user posted what they claimed was a "leak" of Ben's latest album on a fan site (eventually called ''[[Way to Normal (Fake)]]''). The file contained nine tracks along with a [[PDF]] of supposed cover art, and was a mix of what appeared to be legitimate songs from ''Way to Normal'', pastiches of dry humor and melodramatic pop interwoven with bright, energetic melodies. Folds explained on Triple J radio a few weeks later that in one overnight session in Dublin he and the band had recorded 'fake' versions of songs from the new album. His sources had then leaked them to the public as a light-hearted joke on his fans.<ref name=Buell>Buell, Gromt. [http://benfolds.org/forum/59155 "Way to Normal Leak"]. ''BenFolds.org''. 2008-07-16.</ref>

''[[Way to Normal]]'' was released on September 30, 2008 in the United States and on September 29, 2008 in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesuburbs.org.uk/news/_Way_To_Normal__UK_Release_Date_29th_September |title=the original Ben Folds website - 'Way To Normal' UK Release Date: 29th September |publisher=theSuburbs.org.uk |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref><ref>http://www.benfolds.com/info.html{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imeem.com/benfolds |title=Hitlijsten, muziek top 100 &#124; Myspace Music |publisher=Imeem.com |date=2011-02-03 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>  It became Folds' highest-charting album ever in the US, debuting at #11 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Up for Discussion Jump to Forums |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003871707 |title=T.I.

Soon before ''Way to Normal'' was released, Folds announced that he planned to record an album with English author [[Nick Hornby]], with Hornby writing the lyrics and Folds writing the music. The idea of the collaboration came out of the 'fake' leak of the album ''Way to Normal'' released in July 2008. "(We will) write and record it in about three days, just like we did in Dublin with the fake record," Folds said.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,24353510-7484,00.html | title=Ben Folds and Nick Hornby plan album | date=September 16, 2008 | work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>

In August 2008, Folds played piano for friend and Japanese singer-songwriter [[Angela Aki]]'s song "Black Glasses" on her new album ''[[Answer (album)|Answer]]''.

On April 28, 2009, Folds released ''Ben Folds Presents University A Cappella'', an album consisting of college student's a cappella arrangements of his music performed by some of the country's best college a cappella groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103468160 |title=Ben Folds Goes A Cappella, With Help - NPR Music |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-04-26 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

Folds' song "[[Rockin' the Suburbs (song)|Rockin' the Suburbs]]" has been featured as part of the music for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s sitcom ''[[Surviving Suburbia]]''.

Folds was also an inaugural member of the [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards']] judging panel to support independent artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |title=Past Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

From December 14 through 21, 2009, Folds was featured as a judge on [[NBC]]'s [[a cappella]] competition  [[The Sing Off]] alongside [[Nicole Scherzinger]] and [[Shawn Stockman]] and offered insightful, constructive comments and criticisms to the contestants. On the final show, in a departure from his a cappella purism, showcased his talents and played the roaring, riffing piano background on "[[Why Can't We Be Friends?]]" sung by the two finalist groups, [[Beelzebubs|The Beelzebubs]] from [[Tufts University]] near Boston and [[Nota (group)|Nota]], from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He again returned for the show's second season, and has been confirmed to return for the third season in September 2011 alongside Stockman and [[Sara Bareilles]].

In March 2010, Folds became a YouTube phenomenon in a video titled "Ode To Merton". In the video, Folds improvises several songs about people that he sees on the popular social networking site [[Chatroulette]], in the style of "[[Merton (YouTube)|Merton]]" another YouTube phenomenon who many thought was Folds himself.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/21/ben-folds-performs-tribut_n_507362.html "Ben Folds performs tribute"], Huffington Post</ref><ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/03/23/2010-03-23_ben_folds_plays_a_game_of_chatroulette_at_north_carolina_concert_as_ode_to_youtu.html "Ben Folds plays a game of Chatroulette at North Carolina concert as ode to YouTube's Merton"], NY Daily News</ref>

Folds' newest album, a collaboration with English author [[Nick Hornby]], is entitled ''[[Lonely Avenue (album)|Lonely Avenue]]'' and was released on September 28, 2010. On June 14, Folds released the official album art via his Twitter account. "From Above", the first single from the album, premiered on Richard Kingsmill's new music show ''2010'' on [[Triple J]] in Australia on July 18, 2010. "From Above" features Australian singer Kate Miller Heidke on backing vocals.

Folds has recently recorded a video song with Nick Hornby and Pomplamoose. As well, English [[List of YouTube personalities|YouTuber]] [[Charlie McDonnell]] was commissioned to create the music video for Folds' song "Saskia Hamilton", which was uploaded on October 1, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | last = McDonnell | first = Charlie | title = Saskia Hamilton (Music Video)] | publisher = YouTube | date = 10-01-10 | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JP5lUN_4Eo | accessdate = 10-02-10}}</ref>

{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2010}}

After Ben Folds Five split, Folds' first tour with a full band was to support the album ''Rockin' The Suburbs''. He was accompanied by [[Snuzz|Britt "Sn<U+00FC>zz" Uzzell]] on guitar and electronic keyboard, [[Millard Powers]] on bass and keys, and [[Jim Bogios]] on drums. Powers and Bogios later went on to join [[Counting Crows]].

On a tour of Australia, Folds joined with solo artists [[Ben Kweller]] and [[Ben Lee]] to travel the country as [[The Bens]], at the suggestion of a fan on Kweller's official website. The trio also went on to record a [[The Bens (EP)|four-track EP]] together.

In the summer of 2004, Folds co-headlined an American tour with fellow singer-songwriters [[Rufus Wainwright]] and [[Guster]]. Folds again performed with Wainwright and Lee in the summer of 2005 as part of the "Odd Men Out" tour. In addition, Folds has performed with many other notable musical names, including [[Weezer]] and [[Tori Amos]]. After seeing [[The Fray]] perform with Weezer, Folds asked the band to join him for twelve performances in 2005.

Folds also performed with the [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]] (WASO) in March 2005, the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]] (BSO) in November 2005, the [[North Carolina Symphony]] in March 2010, and the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra]] in July 2010.  A [[DVD]] of Folds playing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra was released in December 2005.

On May 9, 2007, Folds performed with the [[Boston Pops]] Orchestra. The orchestra's performance was marred when a fight broke out between two audience members in the balcony, though Folds had not yet taken the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18583296/ |title=Fight breaks out at Boston Pops - MUSIC - MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

Folds performed with symphony orchestras again in August 2006 during a tour of Australia, which included performances with the [[Sydney Symphony]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], [[Western Australian Symphony Orchestra]], [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], and [[The Queensland Orchestra]].

After his [[MySpace]] performance on October 24, 2006, Folds's tour performances began to feature a [[synthesizer]], which he uses in many of the songs when played live. The synthesizer is a red [[Clavia Nord Lead 2|Nord Lead II synthesizer]]. During his concerts, Folds performs two of his concert traditions: palm-smashing and throwing his stool at the piano.

Folds toured with [[John Mayer]] as an opening act (though his set typically lasted an hour) in the summer of 2007. During this tour, Mayer sometimes joined Folds on the song "Narcolepsy", playing synth. At various concerts throughout the tour, parents of young children going to see Mayer would file complaints about Folds' lyrics. Folds responded by posting on his website, "We have kids too, but we don't take them out to rock shows that last until 11pm."{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}
