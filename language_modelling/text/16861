'''Hurricane Ismael''' was a minimal hurricane that killed hundreds of people in northern [[Mexico]] in September of the [[1995 Pacific hurricane season]]. It developed from a persistant area of deep convection on [[September 12]], and steadily strengthened as it moved to the north-northwest. Ismael attained hurricane status on [[September 14]] while located 210 miles (340 km) off the coast of Mexico. It continued to the north, and after passing a short distance east of [[Baja California Sur|Baja California]] it made landfall on [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Ismael rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated on [[September 16]] over northwestern Mexico. The remnants entered the [[United States]] and extended eastward into the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].

Offshore, Ismael produced waves of up to 30 feet (9 m) in height. Hundreds of fishermen were unprepared by the hurricane, which was expected to move more slowly, and as a result 52 ships were wrecked, killing 57 fishermen. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000 people homeless. On land, Ismael caused 59 casualties in mainland [[Mexico]] and resulted in $26 million in damage (1995 USD, $34.4 million 2006 USD). Moisture from the storm extended into the [[United States]], causing heavy rainfall and localized moderate damage in southeastern [[New Mexico]].

==Storm History==
{{Storm path|Ismael 1995 track.png}}
A poorly-organized area of convection persisted about 170 miles off the southern coast of [[Guatemala]] on [[September 9]]. It moved west-northwestward, and after three days without further organization a circulation developed off the southwest coast of [[Mexico]]. The system quickly organized, with [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] beginning later that day. Convective [[rainbands|banding]] became better organized, and late on [[September 12]] it developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located about 350 miles south-southwest of [[Manzanillo]]. The depression moved to the northwest, and following an increase in deep convection it intensified into Tropical Storm Ismael early on [[September 13]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1995|title=Hurricane Ismael Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2006-11-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1995ismael.html}}</ref>

Upon attaining tropical storm status, Ismael was located in an area of warm water temperatures with well-established [[Tropical cyclone#Mechanics of tropical cyclones|upper-level outflow]].<ref name="mayfield2">{{Cite web|author=Max Mayfield|year=1995|title=Tropical Storm Ismael Discussion Two|publisher=NHC|accessdate=2006-11-04|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1995/ismael/tropdisc/nep1095.002}}</ref> Initially the storm moved to the northwest, though in response to the interaction with an upper-level low over [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja California]] Ismael gradually turned to the north.<ref name="tcr"/> Such a change in motion was not operationally predicted by forecasters, though they noted uncertainty in Ismael's track due to the low.<ref name="mayfield2"/> Ismael steadily strengthened as it moved northward, though it failed to organize significantly; early on [[September 14]] the center remained poorly defined despite winds of 70 mph.

Ismael quickly developed a poorly-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], and six hours after becoming a hurricane it reached a peak intensity of 80 mph. Steered between a mid- to upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to its west and a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its east, Ismael accellerated as it moved just west of due north. Late on September 14 Ismael passed 65 miles (100 km) east of [[Cabo San Lucas]]. The hurricane maintained its strength as it continued northward, and made landfall on [[Topolobampo]] in the state of [[Sinaloa]] on [[September 15]]. Ismael rapidly weakened as the circulation crossed the high terrain of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], and it dissipated early on [[September 16]] about 55 miles (95 km) south of the Mexico/[[United States]] border. The remnants of Ismael continued northward, and moisture from the storm extended over the southwestern United States eastward through the [[Mid-Atlantic States]].<ref name="tcr"/>

==Preparations==
Initially, Hurricane Ismael was predicted to remain over the open waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. However, when a northward motion became apparent, the government of [[Mexico]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] from [[Manzanillo]] to [[Cabo Corrientes]] and for the [[Islas Marias]]. Shortly thereafter, the warning was extended to [[Los Mochis]] and issued for the eastern coast of [[Baja California Sur]] south of 25<U+00BA> N. Ten hours before Ismael made its final landfall, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from [[Mazatlan]] to [[Los Mochis]].<ref name="tcr"/> Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, 1,572 people evacuated to five emergency shelters.<ref name="cndh">{{Cite web|author=El Presidente de la Comisi<U+00F3>n Nacional|year=1996|title=La Recomendaci<U+00F3>n 64/96, del 30 de julio de 1996 por Huracan Ismael|publisher=Comisi<U+00F3>n Nacional de los Derechos Humanos|language=Spanish|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.cndh.org.mx/recomen/1996/064.htm}}</ref>

==Impact==

Hurricane Ismael produced 30 foot (9 m) waves over the [[Gulf of California]] and coastal waters off of [[Mexico]]. The hurricane, which was forecasted to move more slowly, left hundreds of fisherman unprepared<ref name="ap1">{{Cite web|author=Associated Press|year=1995|title=Hurricane kills 91 in Mexico|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/epacific/ep1995/ismael/news/ss0920p1.gif}}</ref> due to deficient communications between the boats and harbor authorities.<ref name="cndh"/> As a result 52 boats were wrecked, of which 20 sank. 57 fishermen died offshore,<ref name="ismaelsp">{{cite web|author=Daniel Bitr<U+00E1>n Bitr<U+00E1>n|year=2001|title=Caracter<U+00E1>sticas del Impacto Socioecon<U+00F3>mico de los Principales Desastres Ocurridos en M<U+00E9>xico en el Per<U+00ED>odo 1980-99|publisher=Centro Nacional de Prevenci<U+00F3>n de Desastres|language=Spanish|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.proteccioncivil.gob.mx/upLoad/Publicaciones/ised_80_89.pdf}}</ref> with dozens washing ashore as the high tides receded.

While moving through northwestern [[Mexico]], Hurricane Ismael dropped moderate to heavy rainfall including a state maximum of 7.76 inches in [[Sinaloa]], resulting in the flooding of four [[Municipalities of Sinaloa|municipalities]]. In one municipality, the passage of the hurricane destroyed 373 cardboard houses and damaged 4,790 others. The passage of the hurricane left 177 houses without drinking water and left four municipalities without power.<ref name="ismaelsp"/> 
Damage was heaviest where the hurricane made landfall. In [[Los Mochis]], the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles, though no deaths were reported.<Ref name="ap1"/> 59 people were killed in Sinaloa.<ref name="cndh"/>

Ismael produced heavy rainfall further to the north, peaking at 10.9 inches (276 mm) in [[Sonora]]. Severe flooding was reported in [[Huatabampo]]. The hurricane directly affected 24,111 people in 8 [[Municipalities of Sonora|municipalities]]. Throughout Sonora, the strong winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs of 6,827 homes. The hurricane also destroyed 107 schools and 2 health centers in the state. The passage of Hurricane Ismael damaged high-tension power lines and cable lines, causing interruptions to the communication system. The hurricane also weakened 2,163 miles (3,481 km) of gravel roads and damaged about 100 miles (165 km) of paved highways. 250 people lost their jobs in Sonora due to sunken or damaged fishing boats. In addition, about 83 sq. miles (215 sq. km) of crop lands were impacted. Damage in Sonora amounted to $8.6 million (1995 USD, $50 million 1995 [[Mexican peso|MXN]], $11.4 million 2006 USD).<ref name="ismaelsp"/> 

Throughout Mexico the hurricane left 30,000 people homeless.<ref name="ss1"/> Including offshore casualties, Ismael caused at least 116 deaths and damage totaling to $26 million (1995 USD, $197 million 1995 [[MXN]], $34.4 million 2006 USD).<ref name="cancun">{{cite web|author=Centro Nacional de Prevenci<U+00F3>n de Desastres|year=2006|title=Impacto Socioecon<U+00F3>mico de los Ciclones Tropicales 2005|language=Spanish|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.ine.gob.mx/dgicurg/cclimatico/download/cancun_analisis_costos.pdf}}</ref>

Moisture from the remnants of Ismael extended into southwestern [[Arizona]] and southern [[New Mexico]]. The storm dropped heavy precipitation near the New Mexico/[[Texas]] border, including a peak total of 8.53 inches in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]].<ref name="rain">{{cite web|author=David Roth|year=2005|title=Rainfall Summary for Hurricane Ismael|publisher=Hydrometerological Prediction Center|accessdate=2006-11-05|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/ismael1995.html}}</ref> In addition, there were unofficial estimates of over 10 inches. The rainfall led to flooding of roads and buildings. Multiple highways and railroads were closed due to washed outs.

==Aftermath==
Following the passage of the hurricane, reinforcement workers quickly repaired the communication network, and other workers distributed aid to victims in [[Sonora]]. The Mexican government allocated about $4.5 million (1995 USD, $34 million 1995 [[MXN]], $5.9 million 2006 USD) in funds for the restoration of houses and the overall infrastructure.<ref name="ismaelsp"/> Officials distributed 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to hurricane victims. All sunken ships and drowned bodies were ultimately recovered by divers.

Due to the damage and deaths, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ismael with '''Israel''', another Spanish name beginning with the letter "I" set to be used in the [[2001 Pacific hurricane season]]. During the 2001 season, a reporter stationed in [[Israel]] felt offense from the name choice, and the president of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] felt it was insensitive. Hundreds of people sent e-mails or called the [[National Hurricane Center]], and as a result [[Max Mayfield]] called the members of the World Meteorological Organization.<ref name="wpo">{{cite web|author=Hanna Rosin|year=2004|title=Hurricane Names|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50952-2004Aug8_2.html}}</ref> The name Israel was replaced with '''Ivo''' during the season, and is on the naming list for the [[2007 Pacific hurricane season]].<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization|year=2006|title=Regional Association IV (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) Hurricane Operational Plan 2006 Edition|accessdate=2006-11-09|url=http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/TCP/OperationPlans/TCP30-2006%20EN.pdf}}</ref>
