It was released for [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] video game console in 2006 in Japan and North America, and 2007 in Europe and Australia. Despite the closure of Clover Studio a few months after the game's initial release, a version for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] console was developed and produced by [[Ready at Dawn]] and Capcom, which was released in North America in April 2008, in Europe in June 2008, and in Japan in October 2009.

Set sometime in [[History of Japan#Ancient and classical Japan|classical Japanese history]], ''<U+014C>kami'' combines several [[Japanese mythology|Japanese myths, legends]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]] to tell the story of how the land was saved from darkness by the [[Shinto]] [[Solar deity|sun goddess]], named [[Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu]], who took the form of a white [[Gray Wolf|wolf]]. It features a distinct [[Ink and wash painting|sumi-e]]-inspired [[cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] visual style and the [[#Celestial Brush|Celestial Brush]], a [[mouse gesture|gesture-system]] to perform miracles.

''<U+014C>kami'' was one of the last PlayStation 2 games selected for release prior to the release of the [[PlayStation 3]]. Although it suffered from poor sales, ''<U+014C>kami'' earned high acclaim from reviewers and earned, among other awards, the title of [[IGN]]'s 2006 [[Game of the Year]].<ref name="ign goty"/> The Wii version has earned similar praise though the motion control scheme has received mixed reviews from both critics and gamers. A sequel, {{nihongo|''[[<U+014C>kamiden: Chiisaki Taiy<U+014D>]]''|<U+5927><U+795E><U+4F1D><U+FF5E><U+5C0F><U+3055><U+304D><U+592A><U+967D><U+FF5E>||lit. "<U+014C>kami Chronicles: Tiny Sun"}}, has been announced by Capcom for release in 2010 on the [[Nintendo DS]].

==Gameplay==
''<U+014C>kami'' has the player controlling the main character, [[Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu]], in a woodcut, watercolor style, cel-shaded environment, which looks like an animated Japanese ink-illustration (known as [[sumi-e]]) with other styles of art. The gameplay style is a mix of action, platform, and puzzle gaming genres, and has been noted by many reviewers to have numerous similarities in overall gameplay style to [[The Legend of Zelda (series)|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1542741/20070131/index.jhtml | title = GameFile: '<U+014C>kami' Goes Green; Official Wii Word; 'Idol' Launch And More | publisher = MTV | date = 2006-10-10 | last = Totilo | first = Stephen | accessdate = 2007-08-10 }}</ref> an inspiration that director Hideki Kamiya, a self-proclaimed Zelda-fan, has admitted has influenced his general game design.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152880 | title = The Kamiya Touch: An Interview with Clover's Hideki Kamiya | publisher = 1up | last = Mielke | first = James | date = 2006-08-18 | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref> The main story is primarily linear, directed through by Amaterasu's guide Issun, though numerous side quests and optional activities allow for players to explore the game world and take the story at their own pace.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | pages=13<U+2013>14 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref> By completing quests, side quests and small additional activities (such as making trees bloom into life or feeding wild animals), Amaterasu earns Praise, which can then be spent to increase various statistics of the character, such as the amount of health and number of ink wells for Celestial Brush techniques.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | pages=25<U+2013>26 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref>

Combat is staged in a ghostly virtual arena, and Amaterasu can fight enemies using a combination of weapons, fighting techniques and Brush methods to dispatch the foes.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | pages=19<U+2013>20 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref> At the end of combat, money (as [[Japanese yen|yen]]) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and without taking damage. The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests. The money can also be used to buy new combat techniques at [[dojo]]s throughout the land.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=30}}</ref> Additionally, rare Demon Fangs can be earned through combat which can be traded for additional, unique items that are beneficial in gameplay but not required to complete the game.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=31}}</ref> Weapons inspired by the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]], the [[Yata no Kagami|Reflector]], the [[Magatama#Yasakani no Magatama|Rosaries]] and the [[Kusanagi|Glaive]] can be equipped on Amaterasu as either a main or sub-weapon, and used in addition to other melee attacks that the player can have Amaterasu learn through the course of the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/723/723168p1.html | title = The Weapons of <U+014C>kami | date = 2006-08-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | work = IGN PS2 | publisher = IGN Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=22}}</ref>
[[Image:Okami-brush.jpg|left|thumb|The player uses the ''Celestial Brush'' to rejuvenate wilted plants (as shown), repair bridges, slash foes or create elemental effects.]]

===Celestial Brush===
Unique to ''<U+014C>kami'' is the ''Celestial Brush''. Players can bring the game to a pause and call up a [[Washi|canvas]], where the player can draw onto the screen, either using the left analog stick on the PlayStation 2's [[DualShock]] controller or pointing with the [[Wii Remote]].<ref name="ign handson wii"/> This feature is used in combat, puzzles and as general gameplay.<ref>{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | pages=16<U+2013>18 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref> For example, the player can create strong wind by drawing a loop, cut enemies by drawing a line through them or create bridges by painting one, amongst many other abilities. These techniques are learned through the course of the game by completing [[constellation]]s to release the Celestial Brush gods (inspired by the [[Chinese zodiac]]) from their hiding spots.<ref name="ign-review"/> It is also possible to upgrade or modify certain Brush powers later in the game. For example, the Celestial Brush power Inferno can gain a new power called Fireburst, which has a different drawing pattern, and allows players to create flames without relying on torches or other related items. The player's ink for drawing is limited by the amount available in special ink wells, preventing the player from solely using Brush techniques to defeat enemies; ink is restored in the wells over time when the Brush is not used.<ref name="ign-review"/>

==Plot==
''(Note: Most character names below are the shortened names of the U.S. version.)''

===Story===
[[Image:Okami-issun.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu]], the game's protagonist, with Issun, her inch-high guide, atop her snout]]
The game is set in Nippon based on Japanese classic history, and begins with a flashback to events 100 years prior to the game's present, and describes how Shiranui, a pure white wolf, and [[Izanagi|Nagi]], a swordsman, together fought the eight-headed demon [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]] to save Kamiki Village and the maiden [[Izanami-no-Mikoto|Nami]], Nagi's beloved. Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi but manage to seal the demon away. In the game's present, [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susano]], a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend, and Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. [[Konohanasakuya-hime|Sakuya]], the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist [[Issun-b<U+014D>shi|Issun]] (an inch-high Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.<ref name="playtm-review">{{cite web | url = http://play.tm/story/9446 | title = <U+014C>kami - Review | publisher = Play.tm | date = 2007-02-27 | last = Smith | first = Steve | accessdate = 2007-08-10}}</ref> Throughout the journey, Amaterasu is hounded by [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune|Waka]], a strange but powerful individual that seems to have the gift of foresight, and further teases Amaterasu and Issun to his own mysterious ends. Additionally, Amaterasu locates several Celestial Gods who have hidden in the constellations that bestow upon the goddess powers of the Celestial Brush to aid in her quest.

Soon, Amaterasu, along with Susano, must battle Orochi to protect Kamiki Village and rescue Susano's beloved, [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto#Myths|Kushi]], recreating events from 100 years prior. This time, the duo are able to fully conquer the demon, causing a black, evil spirit to float northward. Amaterasu and Issun then embark on a journey across Nippon and continue to remove Orochi's curse on the land through defeating other demons that release similar dark presences floating northward. As Amaterasu travels to find the source of these evil spirits, she is brought to the wreckage of a ship able to travel through the stars: the "Ark of Yamato". Waka appears and reveals himself as a member of the Moon Tribe, a race that had supplied the Ark of Yamato to the Celestial Beings, who used it to escape from Orochi's assault on the Celestial Plain and sail the heavens, unaware of the evil spirits imprisoned on the Ark which attacked and killed all but himself, resulting in the Ark crashing to earth. Amaterasu defeats Yami, the demon controlling all the evil spirits, and rids both the Ark and Nippon of these evil beings forever. With her mission done, Amaterasu departs with Waka on the Ark to sail back to the Celestial Plain together.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file/920500/48479 | title = <U+014C>kami Story Guide | author = ahojed | date = 2007-05-21 | accessdate = 2007-08-11 | publisher = GameFAQs}}</ref>

===Characters===
<!--If you want to work on the redirected character article, please use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:PiccoloNamek/Okamibox. If a copy of the article no longer exists there, please remove this message -->
The player controls <U+014C>kami [[Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu]], the goddess of the sun, in the form of a white wolf.<ref name="manual-characters"/> While Amaterasu is referred to in the Japanese and European version of the game as a female, the North American version never states Amaterasu as a specific sex.<ref name="manual-characters"/><ref name="1up localization"/> Some characters, however, will refer to Amaterasu in either a feminine or masculine method, but neither are shown to be correct nor incorrect. While Amaterasu, when endowed with ink power, is seen by the player with red markings, cloud-like fur on her shoulders, and weapons on her back, most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the [[reincarnation]] of Shiranui (the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present), and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes their power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. [[Issun-b<U+014D>shi|Issun]], an arrogant, inch-tall "wandering artist" seeking out the 13 Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu (whom he calls "Ammy" or "furball") and serves as a guide, dialog [[wikt:proxy|proxy]], and as [[comic relief]].<ref name="manual-characters">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | publisher=Capcom | page=6}}</ref>

While there is not a main singular antagonist within the game, two characters reappear several times within the quest. [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune|Waka]] appears as a young [[Fue|flute]]-playing man to Amaterasu several times in the game, aware of the goddess's form of the white wolf and foretelling of her future and at times battling with her; his dialogue, dropping [[French language|French]] affectionate terms at times, conveys a sense of familiarity with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/764/764454p1.html | title = <U+014C>kami AU Review | last = Shea | first = Cam | date = 2007-02-13 | accessdate =2007-08-11 | work = IGN PS2 | publisher = IGN Entertainment}}</ref> The other is [[Yamata no Orochi|Orochi]], the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of [[sake]] available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor.<ref name="playtm-review"/>

Throughout the game, the player encounters several other characters that are inspired from Japanese folklore.<ref name="Folklore">{{cite book | year=2006 | editor=Capcom Entertainment, Inc. | title=<U+014C>kami instruction manual | pages=34<U+2013>35 | publisher=Capcom }}</ref>

==Development==
''<U+014C>kami'' resulted from the combined ideas of Clover Studio.<ref name="gamespy-inaba"/> The game was originally built around "depict[ing] a lot of nature", but had no central concept or theme, according to lead designer [[Hideki Kamiya]].<ref name="okami prototype">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3176767 | title = Platinum Games' Kamiya Reflects on Bayonetta, Okami | first = Kevin | last = Grifford | date = 2009-11-04 | accessdate = 2009-11-05 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] }}</ref> Kamiya eventually created a minute-long demonstration movie showing a wolf running about a forest, with flowers blossoming in its wake, but still lacked any gameplay. Kamiya and other members of the team introduced ideas around the nature aspect and eventually led to the game's initial prototype, which Kamiya admitted was "incredibly boring to play".<ref name="okami prototype"/> Kamiya suggested that he allowed so many ideas from the team that resulted in the development moving off-target, including creating more of a [[Simulation video game|simulation]]. Eventually, they settled onto the gameplay found in the final product.<ref name="okami prototype"/>

[[Image:Okami-compare.jpg|thumb|right|Side-by-side comparison of the original realistic (left) and the final [[Ink and wash painting|sumi-e]] (right) style used in ''<U+014C>kami'']]
The art in ''<U+014C>kami'' is highly inspired by [[Japanese painting|Japanese]] [[watercolor painting|watercolor]] and [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood carving]] art of the [[Ukiyo-e]] style, such as the work of [[Hokusai]]. ''<U+014C>kami'' was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/5057 | title = <U+014C>kami old/new comparison | date = 2006-08-14 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | publisher = Gamevideos.com}}</ref> However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful [[Ink and wash painting|sumi-e]] style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it.<ref name="1up-inaba">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152846 | title = All the King's Men | publisher = 1up | date = 2006-08-16 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | last = Mielke | first = James }}</ref> The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics.<ref name="ign-art">{{cite web | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/759/759997p1.html | title = Okami Interview AU | work = IGN PS2 | publisher = IGN Entertainment | last = Shea | first = Cam | date = 2007-01-30 | accessdate = 2007-08-09}}</ref> As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about.<ref name="gamespy-inaba">{{cite web | url = http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/okami/690940p1.html | title = Running with the Wolves: Atsushi Inaba talks <U+014C>kami | publisher = Gamespy | date = 2006-02-23 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | last = McGarvey | first = Sterling}}</ref> [[Atsushi Inaba]], CEO of Clover, noted that "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of [[dinosaur]]s, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.<ref>{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 |pages=158<U+2013>159}}</ref>

Amaterasu's initial designs were aimed to avoid having the character look like "your pet wearing clothing".<ref>{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 | page = 109}}</ref> The developers had considered having Amaterasu change into a [[dolphin]] when in the water and a [[falcon]] when jumping off a cliff, but dropped these ideas.<ref>{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 | page = 112}}</ref> Sakuya, designed around a [[peach]] motif, was envisioned with what were called "level 2" and "level 3" designs where the character would wear less clothing as the story progressed, but the "level 3" appearance, effectively naked, was vetoed by Inaba.<ref>{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 |page=115}}</ref> Waka's character was aimed to be a [[Tatsunoko Production|Tatsunoko]]-like character, with the hood designed to be reminiscent of those worn by the [[Science Ninja Team Gatchaman|Gatchaman]].<ref name="waka design">{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 |page=123}}</ref> Orochi in Japanese mythology is a gigantic creature, so lead character designer Takeyasu Sawaki designed the back of the demon to include a garden and palace; this inspired the game designers to include a bell in those structures that would be Orochi's fatal weakness in the game.<ref>{{cite book | title = <U+014C>kami: Official Complete Works | publisher = Udon | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-897376-02-7 |page=174}}</ref>

The localization team had to translate 1500 pages of text to make sure it made sense in a "native check", due to lack of plurals in the [[Japanese language]] and the large number of characters and conditional conversations that the player could interact with.<ref name="1up localization"/> The team recognized that certain elements of the game would not be recognized by Western audiences, but left enough text and details to allow the players to look up the information for themselves.<ref name="1up localization"/> Only one puzzle in the game had to be changed as it required knowledge of the steps in drawing a [[kanji]] character which would be readily known for Japanese audiences; for the Western release, these steps were demonstrated in the game.<ref name="1up localization"/> The team noted that personalities of characters could be easily conveyed in Japanese text simply by the way sentences were constructed or slurred, a feature that could not directly be applied to localization. Instead, working with Kamiya, the team scripted the localization to either recreate the personality to match the Japanese version, or to create a whole new set of mannerisms for the characters as appropriate.<ref name="1up localization"/>

''<U+014C>kami'' was shown at the 2005 [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] Convention, approximately 30% complete, with a planned release in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/okami/preview_6125972.html | title = <U+014C>kami E3 2005 Hands-On | publisher = Gamespot | last = Kasavin | first = Greg | date = 2005-05-19 | accessdate = 2007-08-09}}</ref> At this point, the game had much of the core gameplay, including the Celestial Brush and the combat system in place. The game was released a year later in 2006. However, just a few weeks following its release in North America to strong critical reception, Capcom announced the closure of Clover Studio.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6159721.html | title = Capcom to dissolve Clover Studio | date = 2006-10-12 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | last = Boyes | first = Emma | publisher = Gamespot }}</ref>

===Naming and allusions===
The title of the game is a [[pun]]; the word ''<U+014D>kami'' (<U+72FC>) in Japanese means "wolf". However, the [[kanji|kanji characters]] used as the title of this game (<U+5927><U+795E>), pronounced identically, mean "great [[deity]]", so the main character is a great wolf deity. The same characters (<U+5927><U+795E>) are also used to write the full name of the [[Solar deity|sun goddess]] [[Amaterasu Omikami|Amaterasu <U+014C>mikami]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.idlethumbs.net/display.php?id=262 | title = <U+014C>kami | publisher = Idle Thumbs | date =2007-02-15 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | last = Bishop | first = Lawrence}}</ref> <!--''<U+014C>kami'' can also be read to mean "big paper", hinting at the game's sumi-e-inspired visual style.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}--> The localization team opted to use shorter versions of Japanese names (for example, a boy named "Mushikai" was localized as "Mushi") instead of replacing the names with Western-style ones.<ref name="1up localization">{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3152879 | title = The Wolf Whisperer | publisher = [[1UP]] | first = James | last = Mielke | date = 2006-08-17 | accessdate = 2008-04-22}}</ref> Issun's informal name for Amaterasu in the Western translation, "Ammy", was inspired by Kamiya, and is similar in tone with the Japanese informal name, "Ammako".<ref name="1up localization"/>

Throughout the game, ''<U+014C>kami'' includes several references (in visual effects, animation, or dialogue) to other Capcom titles such as ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', which Clover Studios also developed.<ref name="1up localization"/> For example, Mrs. Orange's technique for making cherry cake parodies ''[[Street Fighter (series)|Street Fighter]]''{{'}}s [[Akuma (Street Fighter)|Akuma's]] Shun Goku Satsu, complete with a kanji word displayed on screen with her back facing the screen.<ref name="1up localization"/> <!--There are also in-jokes regarding the Clover staff. For example, an [[non-player character|NPC]] aptly named "Animal Lover" lost his rabbit named "Inaba", also the last name of the head producer Atsushi Inaba. Also, to further convey the joke, Inaba the rabbit can be seen falling out of a tree directly underneath Atsushi Inaba's name during the closing credits.{{Fact|date=May 2009}}-->

[[Suleputer]] has also published another album, a piano arrangement, entitled ''<U+014C>kami Piano Arrange''. It was released on 30 March 2007. [[Mika Mats<U+016B>ra]] both arranged the 10 songs, and performed it on the piano.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/gaming/music/okami-the-music-cd-244046.php | title = <U+014C>kami the Music CD | date = 2007-03-14 | accessdate = 2007-08-10 | last = Ashcraft | first = Brian | publisher = Kotaku }}</ref>

The characters' speech in the game is actually created by scrambling samples of voice actors' speech, with more emotional lines being created from voice work given in that emotion.<ref name="1up localization"/>

===Wii version===
[[Image:Okami-wii.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the North American Wii version of ''<U+014C>kami''. A [[watermark]] from [[IGN]] can be seen by Amaterasu's mouth.<ref name="ign watermark"/>]]
The gameplay function of "drawing" or "painting" strokes on the screen led several journalists and gamers alike to believe that ''<U+014C>kami'' would be well-suited for the [[Nintendo DS]] or [[Wii]], both of which feature controls capable of creating drawing motions freely. After the game's release, industry rumors of the game being ported to either console persisted, despite Atsushi Inaba of Clover Studio feeling that ''<U+014C>kami'''s action-based gameplay would not translate well to the console<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3154407 | title = Clover Studio's Final Interview? | date = 2006-10-13 | accessdate = 2007-08-09 | last = Kennedy | first = Sam | publisher = 1up}}</ref> and statements from Capcom that there were "no plans for ''<U+014C>kami'' on Wii".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/764/764007p1.html | title = <U+014C>kami Leaping Onto Wii? | work = IGN Wii | publisher = IGN Entertainment | last = Burman | first = Rob | date = 2007-02-13 | accessdate = 2007-08-09}}</ref>

However, at the 2007 UK Gamers Day, Capcom announced that [[Ready at Dawn]] would oversee porting and development of a Wii version of ''<U+014C>kami'' originally scheduled for release in March 2008<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.spong.com/article/14055 | title = Okami For Wii - Confirmed | publisher = SPOnG | accessdate = 2007-10-18 | date = 2007-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85578 | title = <U+014C>kami confirmed for Wii | first = Tom | last = Bramwell | publisher = Eurogamer | date = 2007-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-10-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.readyatdawn.com/news.php?offset=0&news_toc=0&pr_toc=0 | title = <U+014C>kami for the Wii.

{{cquote|...we're getting the game up and running first. The game is enormous.

On 15 November 2007, Svensson noted that the engine had been ported to the Wii, writing that "There are still several systems getting set up properly but there's most definitely a Wii-driven Amaterasu running around Wii-rendered environments as we speak."<ref name="svensson blog"/> <!--He also confirmed that unlike in the PlayStation 2 version, all of the text will be skipable.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.capcom.com/BBS/showpost.php?p=465383&postcount=12 | title = <U+014C>kami Wii - 25 March? and other questions! | date = 2008-01-19 | accessdate = 2008-01-22 | last = Svensson | first = Christian | publisher = Capcom BBS}}</ref>--> A listing posted at Capcom's website for the game on 15 February 2008 revealed that the Wii version would support [[480p]] and [[widescreen]] output,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=8292 | title = <U+014C>kami for Wii to support 480p and widescreens | publisher = Gaming Target | first = Kris | last = Rosado | date = 2008-02-15 | accessdate = 2008-02-15}}</ref> and [[IGN]] confirmed that the motion sensing of the Wii Remote would be used to perform the Celestial Brush features within the game.<ref name="ign handson wii">{{cite web | url = http://wii.ign.com/articles/852/852530p1.html | title = Hands-on <U+014C>kami | date = 2008-02-15 | accessdate = 2008-02-18 | work = IGN Wii | publisher = IGN Entertainment }}</ref> IGN's hands-on also cited small changes to the game such as additional motion-sensing controls using both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment, and the ability to skip cutscenes, but reported no other changes in content of the game.<ref name="ign handson wii"/>

Svennson noted that Capcom would not use television advertising for ''<U+014C>kami'' on the Wii, but would use online marketing, including art contests and a new website with "all sorts of things for fans to use to make stuff".<ref name="ign second chance"/> This site was made live on 3 April 2008, featuring wallpapers, character artwork and fan-created art for the game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52064 | title= Capcom Releases Metric Ton of <U+014C>kami Artwork | date = 2008-04-03 | accessdate =2008-04-03 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Aaron | last = Linde}}</ref> Svennson further noted that "If <nowiki>[</nowiki>''<U+014C>kami'' for the Wii<nowiki>]</nowiki> did the numbers that we did on the PS2, I'd be very happy.

A "paper parchment" filter applied to all on-screen elements that was readily apparent in the PlayStation 2 version was still included in the Wii port, but the effect was made much less significant.<ref name="ign wii review"/><ref name="gamespot wii review"/><ref name="gt ps2 wii compare">{{cite web | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/player/32960.html | title = <U+014C>kami - PS2/Wii Comparison | date = 2008-04-17 | accessdate = 2008-04-17 | publisher = [[Game Trailers]]}}</ref> To help with drawing with the Celestial Brush, two different buttons on the Wii controllers were given brush functionality; one button was assigned to provide free-form strokes, while the other was set to draw a straight line from the starting point.<ref name="xplay wii review"/>

The final credits movie that was in the PlayStation 2 version of the game was removed from the Wii version, much to Kamiya's regret as it removed the ''omoi''<U+2014>"a combination of thoughts, emotions, and messages" <U+2014> from the game: "<nowiki>[The staff roll was]</nowiki> the ''omoi'' of everyone who worked on the project, put together in a moment of bliss held out just for those who completed the journey.

Sales of ''<U+014C>kami'' were considered poor for justifying a sequel; in July 2008, in response to users' questions on the possibility of a sequel, Svensson stated that "I think we need a lot more people buying the current version before we seriously consider a sequel".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=202539 | title = <U+014C>kami needs to sell or no sequel | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date= 2008-07-29 | accessdate = 2008-07-29 | first = Tom | last = Bramwell }}</ref> However, after the appearance of a Japanese trademark by Capcom on the word "<U+014C>kamiden" a few months before the Wii version of ''<U+014C>kami'' in Japan, many speculated that a sequel was pending.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/08/25/okami-2-rumored-mysterious-trademark-discovered/ | title = 'Okami 2' Rumored, Mysterious Trademark Discovered | publisher = [[MTV]] | first = John | last = Constantine | date = 2009-08-25 | accessdate=  2009-08-25 }}</ref> The September 2009 issue of ''[[Famitsu]]'' announced that {{nihongo|''<U+014C>kamiden: Ch<U+012B>saki Taiy<U+014D>''|<U+5927><U+795E><U+4F1D><U+FF5E><U+5C0F><U+3055><U+304D><U+592A><U+967D><U+FF5E>||lit.
