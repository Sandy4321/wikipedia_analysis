The '''N3 class''' was a [[dreadnought battleship]] class designed for the [[Royal Navy]] after [[World War I]], incorporating all the lessons learned from that conflict. They were very similar in design to the {{sclass|G3|battlecruiser}}s, but had larger guns and thicker armour. They were never ordered due to signing of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] in 1922, which limited the size and armament of battleships to {{convert|35000|LT|t|lk=in}} tons and no gun bigger than {{convert|16|in|0}}.

==Background==
In 1916 the US had declared its intention to create a Navy "second to none"; Congress had authorized the building of a large number of battleships and battlecruisers. In response, the Japanese government also began a large programme of warship building ([[Eight-eight fleet|the 8-8 fleet]]). Two improved ''Revenge''-class hulls were rebuilt into the two {{sclass|Renown|battlecruiser|1}}s by the Royal Navy during the war. The only new capital ships [[Keel|laid down]] during the war were the {{sclass2|Admiral|battlecruiser|1}}s. Their design had been called into question after the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916 and three ships of this class were cancelled, leaving only {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} to be completed to an modified design.<ref name=c4>Campbell, Part 1, p. 4</ref>

The US plan had been delayed by the wartime need to build smaller vessels. Nevertheless, estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships.<ref name=c4/> By the beginning of 1920, the Americans had completed one battleship since the end of World War I and and had five more building. Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920<U+2013>21, six of these were the very large and powerful {{sclass|South Dakota|battleship|4|1920}}, armed with twelve 16-inch guns.<ref>Friedman, pp. 420, 446</ref> The Japanese had finished one battleship since the end of the war and had three more under construction. To correct this state of affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in Fiscal Year (FY) 1921<U+2013>22 and again in FY 1922<U+2013>23, but this was changed to four {{sclass2|G3|battlecruiser}}s to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year.<ref name=c4/>

A pair of designs were prepared in June 1920, derived from the ''U-4'' design of 1914, of ships with displacements of about {{convert|50000|LT|t}} and armed with eight or nine guns, in four twin or three triple [[gun turret]]s mounting a new {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} gun then under development. The only limitation of the design was the inability to use British dockyards and pass through the [[Suez Canal]]. The most unusual feature of these designs was that none of the turrets were [[Superfire|superfiring]], presumably to keep the [[centre of gravity]] as low as possible<ref>Brown, pp. 172<U+2013>73</ref> and avoid the extra weight required for tall, superfiring [[barbette]]s.<ref>Campbell, Part 2, p. 13</ref>  

The designs were revised in October and split into separate battleship and battlecruiser designs. The battleship designs were given letters of the alphabet from L through N, with the use of triple or double gun turrets shown by 3 or 2 respectively. Both 'L2' and 'L3' had superfiring guns and the armour was reduced to a {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}} inclined [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] while the main armoured deck was {{convert|8|in|0}} thick ({{convert|9|in|0}} where it sloped to meet the belt). They both had a designed speed of {{convert|25|kn|lk=in}} and had [[transom stern]]s. 'L2' displaced {{convert|52100|LT|t}}, but 'L3' was a thousand tons lighter. 'M2' and 'M3' followed in November and December and were very different from the earlier designs.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 102</ref>

'M2' and 'M3' sacrificed fire directly astern by moving the rear turret(s) amidships in order to save weight by shortening the length of the armoured citadel. Compared to the earlier, more conventional, designs, 'M2' saved {{convert|1540|LT}} and 'M3' {{convert|1740|LT}}.<ref>Brown, p. 174</ref> More weight was saved by reducing the designed speed to {{convert|23|-|23.5|kn}} and using only two propeller shafts, although it was thought that this would improve manoeuvering power over four smaller propellers. These changes saved {{convert|4350|LT}} for 'M2' and {{convert|5000|LT}} for 'M3' over their predecessors. A lengthened version of 'M3' was chosen for further development as N3 and approved in November 1921.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 102, 105</ref> 

==Description==
[[Image:HMS Nelson off Spithead for the Fleet Review.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|alt=Photo showing a battleship in the foreground and more battleships and cruisers in the background|Many of the aspects of the N3 design were incorporated into HMS ''Nelson'', shown here.]] 
Most noticeable of the N3 design was the concentration of the main battery forward of the bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 127</ref>

The N3 battleships were significantly larger than their predecessors of the {{sclass|Revenge|battleship|4}}. They had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|820|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|106|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. They would have displaced about {{convert|48500|LT|t}}, nearly double the displacement of the older ships. They had a complete [[double bottom]] {{convert|7|ft|1}} deep.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 101, 105</ref>

The ships would have had two geared [[steam turbine]] sets, each of which drove one propeller shaft, in two engine rooms forward of the boiler rooms. This allowed the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] to be placed further aft and increased the ability of the rear turret to fire to the rear. The turbines would have been powered by [[water-tube boiler|small-tube boilers]] intended to produce a total of {{convert|56000|shp|lk=in}}. The ships' maximum speed would have been about 23 knots.<ref>Brown, pp. 174<U+2013>75</ref>

Housing the main armament in triple turrets was new to the Royal Navy though British companies had been involved in the production of triple gun turret designs for other navies.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 9</ref> The choice of a high muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15-inch Mark I]] gun of 42-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.<ref>Campbell, Part 1, p. 7</ref>

===Armament===
The N3 design mounted nine 45-calibre [[List_of_British_ordnance_terms#BL|BL]] 18-inch guns in three triple gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', and 'X' from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of 40<U+00B0>.<ref>Raven and Roberts, pp. 105<U+2013>06</ref> As none of these guns was ever completed as test fired sources differ on their exact specifications. Naval historian John Campbell quotes the projectile weight as {{convert|2916|lb|kg}} fired at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2650|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}},<ref>Campbell, Part 1, pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref> but Alan Raven and John Roberts cite a {{convert|2837|lb|kg}} fired at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2700|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.<ref name=r6>Raven and Roberts, p. 106</ref> The N3s carried a secondary armament of sixteen [[BL 6 inch Mk XXII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mk XXII guns]] in [[Superfire|superfiring]] twin turrets. Four turrets were sited around the forward superstructure and four at the stern.<ref name="rr68">Raven and Roberts, p. 100</ref> The guns could elevate between <U+2013>5<U+00B0> and +60<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2945|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|25800|yd|m|abbr=on}} at 45<U+00B0> elevation. Their rate of fire was five rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_6-50_mk22.htm|title=British 6"/50 (15.2 cm) BL Mark XXII|date=7 January 2007|publisher=Navweaps.com|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref>

An [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] battery of six [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mk VIII guns]] was included.<ref name="c442">Campbell, Part 3, p. 42</ref> They had a maximum depression of -5<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 90<U+00B0>. They fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High_explosives|high explosive]] shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_47-40_mk8.htm|title=British 4.7"/43 (12 cm) QF Mark VII 4.7"/40 (12 cm) QF Mark VIII 4.7"/40 (12 cm) QF Mark X|date=31 December 2006|publisher=Navweaps.com|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref> The ships were intended to carry four 10-barreled mountings for the {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk VIII gun]] (commonly known as a ''pom-pom''), two [[wikt:abaft|abaft]] the funnels and two at the stern. Each barrel was provided with 1300 rounds of ammunition.<ref name="c442"/> The gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} {{convert|.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96<U+2013>98 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_2pounder_m8.htm|title=Britain 2-pdr [4 cm/39 (1.575")] Mark VIII|date=20 February 2008|publisher=Navweaps.com|accessdate=7 June 2010}}</ref>

Like previous classes of British battlecruisers, a pair of submerged, broadside-firing [[torpedo tube]]s were planned for these ships. Their compartment was located just forward of the 'A' shell room on the platform deck.<ref name="rr68"/> Six {{convert|24.5|in|adj=on}} torpedoes per tube were to be carried in peace-time, but this would increase to eight in wartime.<ref name="c442"/> These Mark I torpedoes had a warhead of {{convert|743|lb|0}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and were powered by oxygen-enriched air. They had two speed settings which governed their range: either {{convert|15000|yd|0}} at {{convert|35|kn}}, or {{convert|20000|yd|0}} at {{convert|30|kn}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PreWWII.htm|title=British Torpedoes Pre-World War II: 24.5" (62.2 cm) Mark I|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=7 March 2010|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref>

===Fire-control===
The main guns of the battleships could be controlled from any of the two [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]]s (DCT). The primary DCT was mounted at the top of the forward superstructure. Another was mounted on the roof of the [[conning tower]] in an armoured hood.<ref name=rr6>Raven and Roberts, pp. 100, 106</ref> Each main gun turret was provided with a {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on|1}} [[coincidence rangefinder]] in an armoured housing on the turret roof.<ref name="c442"/> The secondary armament was primarily controlled by two DCTs mounted on each side of the bridge. The anti-aircraft guns were controlled by a high-angle control system mounted on the [[mizzenmast]].<ref name="rr6"/> Each ''pom-pom'' mount had its own director and there was also a height-finder aft. Two {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on|1}} torpedo rangefinders were located on the sides of the funnels.<ref name="c442"/>

===Armour===
A first for any British [[dreadnought]] was the use of the [[All or Nothing (Battleship armour)|all or nothing]] protection scheme in the N3s and G3s. Medium-thickness armour had proven to be useless in stopping heavy-calibre shells during World War I so the vital areas of the ship were protected by the thickest possible armour and the rest of the ship was left unarmoured. Use of this system was pioneered by contemporary [[U.S. Navy]] battleship designs starting with the {{sclass|Nevada|battleship}}. However, this system of protection required that the [[armoured citadel]] should have enough [[reserve buoyancy]] to keep the ship stable even if the rest of the hull was riddled by gunfire.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 92</ref>

The waterline belt of the N3 had a maximum thickness of {{convert|15|in|0}} thick with the top of the armour angled outwards. This angle increased the armor's relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire, albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. It ran some {{convert|463|ft|1}}, from {{convert|9|ft|1}} forward of 'A' barbette to the rear of the after 6-inch [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]. For about {{convert|115|ft|1}}, it reduced to {{convert|13.5|in|0}} over the engine and boiler rooms. The belt had a height of {{convert|14|ft|3|in|m|1}}, of which {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. The lower edge of the belt abreast the magazines was continued down another {{convert|3|ft|1}} by a {{convert|4|in|0}} thickness of high-tensile steel inclined at 36<U+00B0> to prevent a shell from reaching the magazines via a wave trough at high speed. The ends of the belt terminated in {{convert|14|in|0|adj=on}} tranverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.<ref name=c3>Campbell, Part 3, p. 43 and Part 4, p. 37</ref> The {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} armoured deck matched the length of the waterline belt and sloped down to meet the upper edge of the belt. It extended forward over the torpedo compartment which had a separate transverse bulkhead protecting it that was {{convert|9|in|0}} thick. The steering gear was protected by a deck and bulkhead {{convert|6|in|0}} thick.<ref name=r6/>

The turret faces were {{convert|18|in|0}} thick while their sides were probably {{convert|14|in|0}} in thickness, and the roof was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The armour of the barbettes and the [[conning tower]] was 15&nbsp;inches thick and the conning tower's communications tube to the upper deck was 8&nbsp;inches thick. The fire-control director atop the conning tower was protected by an armoured hood 4 to 6&nbsp;inches thick.<ref name=r6/>

The [[anti-torpedo bulge]]s of the N3 were internal to the hull and were intended to withstand the explosion of a {{convert|750|lb|adj=on}} torpedo [[warhead]]. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the {{convert|2|in|0}} thick [[torpedo bulkhead]]. The bulkhead was situated about {{convert|16|ft|1}} inboard from the side of the ship.<ref name=c3/> Postwar tests done on a replica of this system showed that filling the buoyancy space with water rather than the sealed steel crushing tubes as used in {{HMS|Hood|51|2}} was just as effective and weighed less.<ref>Raven and Roberts, p. 93</ref>

==Cancellation==
The four N3 battleships were never ordered because the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], an [[Arms control|arms limitation]] treaty under negotiation at the time, forbade construction of any ship larger than 35,000 tons. Many of the aspects of their design ultimately were incorporated into the two {{sclass|Nelson|battleship}}s, and they are often described as being a cut-down N3. Indeed, the ''Nelsons'' received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence, although they used the guns intended for the G3 battlecruisers for cost reasons and to comply with the Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament.<ref>Campbell, Part 4, pp. 37<U+2013>38</ref>
