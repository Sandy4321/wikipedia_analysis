==Reception and roles==

Moore has been described in the media as one of the most talented and accomplished actresses of her generation.<ref name="skin"/><ref name="hidden"/><ref name="safe"/> As a woman in her 50s, she is unusual in being an older actress who continues to work regularly and in good roles.<ref>{{cite news|author=Lipworth, Elaine|title=Julianne Moore: marriage is really hard|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/julianne-moore-marriage-is-really-hard-20110919-1kgwb.html#ixzz2MtUk6w6r|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=March 10, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120124041708/http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/julianne-moore-marriage-is-really-hard-20110919-1kgwb.html#ixzz2MtUk6w6r|archivedate=January 24, 2012}}</ref> She enjoys the variety of appearing in both low-budget independent films and large-scale Hollywood productions.<ref name="arts desk"/><ref name="less"/> In 2004, an [[IGN]] journalist wrote of this "rare ability to bounce between commercially viable projects like ''Nine Months'' to [[art house]] masterpieces like ''Safe'' unscathed", adding, "She is respected in art houses and [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplexes]] alike."<ref name="ign">{{cite web|last=Otto|first=Jeff|title=Interview: Julianne Moore|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2004/04/29/interview-julianne-moore-2|publisher=IGN|accessdate=August 26, 2013|date=April 29, 2004|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6JASJwl3a|archivedate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> She is noted for playing in a range of material,<ref name="hidden"/><ref name="less"/> and the director Ridley Scott, who worked with Moore on ''Hannibal'', has praised her versatility.<ref name="hello"/>

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|quote="I never care that [my characters] are "strong". I never care that they're even affirmative. I look for that thing that's human and recognizable and emotional. You know, we're not perfect, we're not heroic, we're not in control. We're our own worst enemies sometimes, we cause our own tragedies&nbsp;... that's the stuff that I think is really compelling." <ref name="actors"/>|source=<U+2014>Moore explaining why she is drawn to playing troubled women}}

Moore is particularly known for playing troubled women,<ref name="savage"/> and specializes in "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions".<ref name="skin"/> Oliver Burkeman of ''The Guardian'' writes that her characters are typically "struggling to maintain a purchase on normality in the face of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure".<ref name="unravel"/> Suzie Mackenzie, also of ''The Guardian'', has identified a theme of "characters in a state of alienation&nbsp;... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question."<ref name="hidden"/> Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks.<ref name="cry"/><ref name="unravel"/><ref name="brantley3"/> The journalist [[Kira Cochrane]] has identified this as a "trademark moment" in many of her best films,<ref name="cry"/> while it has led Burkeman to call her the "queen of the big-screen breakdown".<ref name="unravel"/> "When she does finally crack," writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore."<ref name="talk"/> Ben Brantley of ''The New York Times'' has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is "peerless" in her "portraits of troubled womanhood."<ref name="brantley3">{{cite news|author=Brantley, Ben|title=OSCAR FILMS: The Housewife and the Butcher; In the Art of Julianne Moore, Serenity Masks the Panic|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/movies/oscar-films-housewife-butcher-art-julianne-moore-serenity-masks-panic.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 9, 2003|accessdate=August 26, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/movies/oscar-films-housewife-butcher-art-julianne-moore-serenity-masks-panic.html|archivedate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is "a bit of a bore".<ref name="brantley3"/> "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," he says, "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of."<ref name="brantley"/>

An interest in portraying "actual human drama" has led Moore to these roles.<ref name="arts desk"/><ref name="actors"/> She is particularly moved by the concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity.<ref name="skin"/> Roles where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because "we're just not very often in that position in our lives."<ref name="unravel"/> Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries,<ref name="cry"/> and she continues to be praised for her "fearless" performances and for taking on difficult roles.<ref name="arts desk"/><ref name="savage"/><ref name="red alert">{{cite news|last=Iley|first=Chrissy|title=Red Alert|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/06/features.culture|newspaper=The Observer|date=July 6, 2008|accessdate=July 15, 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130216115547/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/jul/06/features.culture|archivedate=February 16, 2013}}</ref> When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, "Nothing within the realm of human behaviour".<ref name="cry"/> She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes,<ref name="talk"/><ref name="spirits"/> although Moore has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role.<ref name="arts desk"/><ref name="red alert"/>

Regarding her approach to acting, Moore said in a 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: "I want to have a sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera." The aim, she said, is to "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [happen] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it&nbsp;... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding."<ref name="actors"/>

Alongside her acting work, Moore has established a career as a [[Children's literature|children's author]].

She was reminded of her own childhood, when she was teased for having freckles and called "Freckleface Strawberry" by other children. Expanding on this experience and the moral of the book, Moore says, "for the next 20 years or so, you can be obsessed by your big feet or your big teeth or your crazy hair<U+2014>before you come out on the other end and say, 'I may not like parts of how I look, but there's not a whole lot I can do about it.'"<ref name="freckles">{{cite web|last=Hammel|first=Sara|title=Julianne Moore's Old Nickname: Freckleface Strawberry|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20152772,00.html|accessdate=July 15, 2013|work=People|date=October 21, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130117024154/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20152772,00.html|archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref> The book was a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Freckleface Strawberry, Musical|url=http://www.josef-weinberger.com/musicals/musical/freckleface-strawberry.html|publisher=Joseph Weinberger Ltd|accessdate=April 2, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6FaUEuXQ0|archivedate=April 2, 2013}}</ref>
