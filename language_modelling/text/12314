The film was another Yash Raj big-budget film and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production overseas, with revenues of Rs&nbsp;430&nbsp;million internationally.<ref name="Overseas market"/> The film tells the story of a contemporary [[cohabitation|cohabiting]] Indian couple. Zinta played the female protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in [[Australia]]. The film was well received by critics, and Zinta's performance earned her nominations for ''Best Actress'' at a number of award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh wrote, "After ''Kya Kehna'', Preity Zinta accepts the challenge of portraying an unwed mother yet again in ''Salaam Namaste''. The actor is terrific, delivering her most accomplished performance to date.

Zinta received further success in 2006, starring in Karan Johar's drama ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' with an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, [[Abhishek Bachchan]], [[Rani Mukerji]] and [[Kirron Kher]]. The film became one of the biggest box office hits in India, earning Rs&nbsp;464&nbsp;million, and grossed over Rs&nbsp;445&nbsp;million overseas, the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years.<ref name="Overseas market"/> The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in [[New York]], and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, a fashion magazine editor; her performance was appreciated by critics. According to ''indiaFM'', "Preity not only looks gorgeous, but the dedication to her role shows at vital points. Her penultimate scene with Rani Mukerji, when she confronts her at the marriage reception, is fabulous."<ref>{{cite web|author=Adarsh, Taran|title=Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna Review|date=[[August 9]], [[2006]]|url=http://www.indiafm.com/movies/review/12514/index.html|publisher=indiaFM|accessdate=2007-05-07}}</ref>

She then starred in [[Shirish Kunder]]'s romantic musical ''[[Jaan-E-Mann]]'', a story set in the United States about two men, played by [[Salman Khan]] and [[Akshay Kumar]], who love the same woman.

[[Tabloid]]s have often linked Zinta romantically with other Bollywood stars, but she has strongly denied these rumours.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gangadhar, V|title=Preity Magic|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040724/saturday/main1.htm|publisher=''[[The Tribune]]''|date=[[July 24]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> In 2000, Zinta began dating model [[Marc Robinson]]. They separated one year later, and according to Zinta remained on good terms. Asked in [[Filmfare]] about their break-up, she spoke of "very, very fond memories of the times we were together and I'd like to keep it to that".<ref>{{cite web|author=Pillai, Jitesh|title=Freedom at midnight...Preity Zinta|date=April 2001|url=http://downloads.movies.indiatimes.com/site/april2001/sp3.html|publisher=[[indiatimes]]|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> Zinta has dated the [[Bombay Dyeing]] heir, businessman [[Ness Wadia]] since February 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shaikh, Jamal|title=Preity woman's man|date=[[February 3]], [[2005]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1010644.cms|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> Their relationship is discussed frequently by reporters, who often speculate about their engagement.<ref>{{cite web|author=K Jha, Subhash|title=Preity all set to marry Ness Wadia|date=[[April 11]], [[2007]]|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1892482.cms|publisher=[[indiatimes]]|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Lalwani, Vickey; Shah, Kunal|title=Ness & I are fine:Preity Zinta|date=[[January 25]], [[2008]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ness__I_are_finePreity_Zinta/rssarticleshow/2726680.cms|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2008-02-14}}</ref> In December 2006, another controversy featured Zinta when Ness Wadia was reported to have attacked construction workers at her residence in [[Bandra]].

She challenged the press to deliver proof, and offered Rs&nbsp;1&nbsp;[[crore]] (Rs&nbsp;10&nbsp;million) if an injured woman was found. No evidence was found and the rumour has subsequently been regarded as false.<ref name="1 crore"/>

In March 2007, Zinta was involved in a scandal when actress and singer [[Suchitra Krishnamurthy]] cited her as the cause of her divorce from [[Shekhar Kapur]], alleging that Zinta was having an affair with him.<ref name="Alleged affair">{{cite web|author=TNN|title='Suchitra is unstable'|date=[[March 30]], [[2007]]|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1835376.cms|publisher=''[[The Times of India]]''|accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> Although initially silent on the issue,<ref name="Alleged affair"/> after another accusation by Krishnamurthy, Zinta replied, "It is unfortunate that I am bearing the brunt of someone else<U+2019>s paranoia.

==In the media==
Zinta is particularly known in the Indian media for her straightforwardness and for honestly expressing her outspoken views and forthright opinions in public, be it about her on-screen or off-screen life or raising a voice against any social injustice.<ref name=brave2/><ref name=brave3/> These features were noted during the ''Bharat Shah Case'', when she testified against the underworld. Following this incident she was described by journalists as "The only man in Bollywood".<ref name=charities/> Her characteristic dimple has been cited by the media as her trademark. She is often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she has confessed to disliking.<ref name="bubbly image"/>

On [[July 15]], [[2005]], Zinta filed a defamation suit against leading Mumbai tabloid ''[[MiD DAY|Mid-Day]]'' after tapes emerged alleging that Salman Khan had made derogatory comments about her. The tabloid published transcripts indicating that she had a sexual relationship with Khan, and she was [[Cross-examination|cross-examined]] as a chief witness in January 2007.<ref name="cross-examined">{{cite web|author=Kagalwala, Gautam|publisher=Indiatimes.com|title=Preity Zinta cross-examined in her defamation case against tabloid|date=[[March 23]], [[2007]]|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/News__Gossip/News/Preity_Zinta_cross-examined_in_her_defamation_case_against_tabloid/articleshow/msid-1809241,curpg-2.cms|accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> She said about the case, "I felt humiliated as it spoiled my reputation and character in public."

The tape was examined by the [[Government of India|Government's]] Forensic laboratory in [[Chandigarh]] which concluded that it was a fake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/09/17/int6.htm|title=Salman cleared in Aishwarya tape case|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=[[September 17]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>

Between 2004 and 2007, Zinta made three appearances on the Indian talk show ''[[Koffee with Karan]]'', hosted by [[Karan Johar]], appearing with [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Abhishek Bachchan]] and [[Bobby Deol]], respectively. In 2006, she was a guest judge in the singing talent contest ''[[Indian Idol 2]]''. She returned briefly to her occupation as a model when she walked the ramp for [[Manish Malhotra]]'s display ''Fashion Week 2006'', along with actress [[Kajol]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Diniz, Merril|title=Malhotra gets his 'Freedom'!|url=http://specials.rediff.com/getahead/2006/mar/28fwmalhotra.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Later that year, Zinta and filmmaker Karan Johar represented Bollywood at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] to promote Johar's forthcoming ''Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna'', which featured Zinta in a leading role.<ref>{{cite web|author=AP|title=Bollywood Actress Heads To Cannes|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/12/entertainment/cannes/main1614686.shtml|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|date=[[May 12]], [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>
