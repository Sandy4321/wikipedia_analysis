'''''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''''' is a [[2009 in film|2009]] [[film]] based on a twelve-issue [[comic book]] [[limited series]] [[Watchmen|of same name]] created by writer [[Alan Moore]], artist [[Dave Gibbons]], and [[colorist]] [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]], published by [[DC Comics]] between 1986 and 1987. The [[graphic novel]]'s [[film rights]] were acquired by [[film producer|producer]] [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] in 1986. Many problems [[Development hell|halted the adaptation's development]], with four different studios and various directors and screenwriters being attached to the project through twenty years. In 2006, [[Zack Snyder]], who at the time was filming another comic book adaptation, ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', was hired by [[Warner Bros.]] to helm ''Watchmen''. Filming started in 2007, and following deals with two of the previous companies involved in the development<U+2014>[[Paramount Pictures]], responsible for international distribution rights, and [[20th Century Fox]], which received the right to part of the gross<U+2014>the ''Watchmen'' adaptation was finally released on March 2009.

==Pre-production==
===Failed projects===
In August 1986, producer [[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Lawrence Gordon]] acquired the film rights to ''[[Watchmen]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]], with producer [[Joel Silver]] working on the film.<ref name="thomson">{{cite news|author=[[Anne Thompson|Thompson, Anne]]|title=Filmmakers intent on producing new comic-book movies|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=1986-08-26}}</ref> Fox asked author [[Alan Moore]] to write a screenplay based on his story, but when Moore declined the studio enlisted screenwriter [[Sam Hamm]]. On September 9, 1988, Hamm turned in his first draft, but said that condensing a 338-page, nine-panel-a-page comic book into a 128-page script was arduous. He took the liberty of re-writing ''Watchmen'''s complicated ending into a "more manageable" conclusion involving an assassination and a time paradox.<ref name=hughes147/> Fox put the film into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] in 1991, and Gordon set up the project at a new company, Largo International, with Fox distributing the film. Although Largo closed three years later, Fox was promised that they would be involved if the project was revived.<ref name=turnaround>{{cite news|author=Cieply, Michael|title=Battle Over 'Watchmen' Surrounds a Producer|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-09-20|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/movies/20watc.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-09-20}}</ref>

Gordon and Silver moved the project to [[Warner Bros.]], where [[Terry Gilliam]] was attached to direct. Unsatisfied with how Hamm's script fleshed out the characters, Gilliam brought in [[Charles McKeown]] to rewrite it. The second draft, which was credited to Gilliam, [[Warren Skaaren]], and Hamm rather than McKeown, used the character [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]]'s diary as a [[voice-over]], and restored scenes from the comic book that Hamm had removed.<ref name=hughes147>{{harv|Hughes|2008|p=147}}</ref> According to ''Watchmen'' artist [[Dave Gibbons]], Silver wanted to cast [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as Dr. Manhattan.<ref name="history">{{cite news|author=Jensen, Jeff|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854,00.html|title=''Watchmen'': An Oral History|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2005-10-25|accessdate=2007-02-02}}</ref> Filming was to take place at [[Pinewood Studios]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Rebello, Stephen|title=Sam Hamm <U+2013> Screenwriter|work=[[Cinefantastique]]|pages=34<U+2013>41|date=November 1989|accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> Because both Gilliam and Silver's previous films, ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'' and ''[[Die Hard 2]]'' respectively, went over budget, they were only able to raise $25 million for the film<U+2014>a quarter of the necessary budget.<ref name=hughes147/> As a result, Gilliam abandoned the project, and ultimately decided that ''Watchmen'' was unfilmable. Gilliam explained, "Reducing [the story] to a two or two-and-a-half hour film [...] seemed to me to take away the essence of what ''Watchmen'' is about."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.empireonline.com/News/story.asp?nid=13532|title=Python Won<U+2019>t Bite For ''Watchmen''|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire Online]]|date=2000-11-13|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> When Warner Bros. dropped the project, Gordon invited Gilliam back to helm the film independently.

===Successful development===
After Warner Bros. officially became involved, the studio claimed that because Paramount had not fully reimbursed Universal for its development costs, Paramount had no legal claim over the film rights.

Composer [[Tyler Bates]] began scoring ''Watchmen'' in November 2007. He planned to visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view assembly cuts of scenes to begin rough composing.<ref>{{cite news|author=Edward Douglas|title=Exclusive: Tyler Bates Interview!|publisher=ShockTillYouDrop|date=2007-08-17|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=1103|accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', ''[[Blade Runner]]'', and ''[[To Live and Die in L.A.

===Editing===
Snyder's first cut of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself "the gatekeeper" of the comic's easter eggs, "while [the studio] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost perspective on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? How will people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me."<ref>{{cite news|author=Cindy White|title=Snyder Cutting Watchmen|publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]]|date=2008-06-26|archivedate=2008-06-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080627071530/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=56712|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=56712&type=0|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized there was a way to further trim the film:<ref name=journal/> the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which "was easy without destroying the movie".<ref name=murder>{{cite news|author=Bill Desowitz|title=Snyder Discusses Extended Versions of Watchmen|work=VFXWorld|date=2009-02-18|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=3631a5a1&atype=news&id=26500|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>

===Moore and Gibbons' involvement===
{{see also|Watchmen#Publication_and_reception|l1=Watchmen's publication and ownership}}
When 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to ''Watchmen'', the comic's writer [[Alan Moore]] was initially excited about the film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of ''Comics Interview'', he revealed [[Sam Hamm]], who was attached to write, visited him in [[Northampton]] for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt<!--He is not referred to as Ozymandias in the Hamm script--> die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported to the real world created as a result of time travel.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniel Manu|title=Alan Moore endorsed ''Watchmen'' Movie... in 1987|publisher=[[Television Without Pity]]|date=2008-10-16|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/mwop/moviefile/2008/10/alan-moore-endorsed-watchmen-m.php|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'''s Danny Graydon, during [[Warner Bros.]]'s first possession of feature film rights for ''[[Watchmen]]'', Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others<U+2019> opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he "didn't think it was filmable". Moore clarified for Graydon, "I didn't design it to show off the similarities between cinema and comics, which ''are'' there, but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn't."<ref>{{harv|Hughes|2008|p=146}}</ref>

In December 2001, Moore further explained his opposition, citing how a reader can take the time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brian Hiatt|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,187633-2-2_1%7c%7c233612%7c1_,00.html|title=Watching the Detectives|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2001-12-10|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from ''Watchmen'' to the comic's artist, [[Dave Gibbons]].<ref name="history"/> In Moore<U+2019>s opinion, [[David Hayter|Hayter]]<U+2019>s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added that he would not be going to see the film when completed. Moore said, "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee."<ref name="history"/>

In November 2006, Zack Snyder said that he hoped to speak to Moore before filming, though the writer had sworn off involvement with film or television productions after his disagreement over the ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' film adaptation.<ref name="update"/> Moore signed a deal to go uncredited on the film, and for his share of the income be given to Gibbons, as he had done on ''V for Vendetta''.<ref name=gibbonschat>{{cite news|title=Talking With Dave Gibbons|date=2008-10-16|publisher=WatchmenComicMovie.com|url=http://www.watchmencomicmovie.com/101608-watchmen-comic-dave-gibbons-interview.php|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> Before filming began, Snyder said, "[I] totally respect his wishes to not be involved in the movie."<ref name=prepare>{{cite news|author=Kiel Phegley|title=Zack Snyder prepares for Watchmen|work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]|date=2007-08-21|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080210171237/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/082107wmen.html|archivedate=2008-02-10|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/082107wmen.html|accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Moore expressed discontent over the choice of the director, saying that he "had a lot of problems" with the comic book ''[[300 (comics)|300]]'' and that, while he had not seen it, he had heard that Snyder's film adaptation was racist, homophobic, and "sublimely stupid".<ref>{{cite journal|first=Nisha|last=Gopalan|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20213067_20213068_20213004,00.html|title=Alan Moore Still Knows the Score!|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2008-07-22}}</ref> 

In an early interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'''s Ken Tucker, ''Watchmen'' artist Dave Gibbons said that he thought the time had passed to make a ''Watchmen'' movie. Gibbons felt that the window to make a ''Watchmen'' movie was during the success of the 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film. When that time passed, Gibbons also told ''[[Neon (magazine)|Neon]]'' magazine that he was "[<U+2026>] glad because it wouldn't have been up to the book".<ref>{{harv|Hughes|2008|p=147}}</ref> Gibbons felt it would probably be better adapted as a television series like ''[[The Prisoner]]''.<ref name=prisoner>{{cite web|url=http://watchmencomicmovie.com/021209-watchmen-dave-gibbons-video-interview.php|title=Dave Gibbons Interview|publisher=WatchmenComicMovie.com|format=Video|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-02-12}}</ref> When given the opportunity, Gibbons enjoyed the script by Alex Tse.<ref name="snydercon07">{{cite news|author=Douglas, Edward|title=Zack Snyder Talks ''Watchmen''!|publisher=Comingsoon.net|date=2007-07-27|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/watchmennews.php?id=6086|accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> Gibbons gave Snyder some script advice, which the director accepted.<ref name=prepare/> He drew licensing art for the film, consulted on merchandise and the webcomics, publicizing the film with Snyder, and wrote a tie-in book about the creation of the comic, entitled ''Watching the Watchmen''. Moore did not mind Gibbons' involvement and felt it did not have any impact on their friendship.<ref name=gibbonschat/> Snyder asked Gibbons to draw up a storyboard for the film's altered ending, which the comics' colorist [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]] also returned to work on.<ref name=skulk/> Gibbons believed watching the film on DVD would emulate flipping through the book, with viewers pausing or rewinding the film to catch details.<ref name=prisoner/>

===Litigation===
On February 14, 2008, 20th Century Fox brought a lawsuit against Warner Bros. that alleged copyright infringement on the ''Watchmen'' film property. The studio believed it held the rights to produce the film, or at least distribute it, no matter how many studios ''Watchmen'' passed through, and sought to block its release. Warner Bros. said that Fox repeatedly failed to exercise its rights over various incarnations of the production.<ref name="horn">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-ca-watchmen16-2008nov16,0,4972856,full.story|title=A super battle over 'Watchmen'|author=John Horn|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2008-11-16|accessdate=2008-11-17}}</ref> Through producer Lawrence Gordon, Fox had bought the rights to the comic book in 1986.<ref name="thomson"/> Fox alleges that when it put the project into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] in 1994, a separate 1991 deal that transferred some of the rights to Gordon still gave them the option of distribution, sequel rights, and a share of the profits should it be made by any other studio. Fox's interpretation of the 1994 turnaround deal also meant that Gordon would not fully control the rights until the studio's development costs<U+2014>estimated by Fox at $1 million<U+2014>had been reimbursed. Despite originally passing on the project, Fox also alleged that its agreement with Gordon contained a "changed elements" clause, meaning that if Gordon changed any of the key creative personnel on the film, Fox would have first option on participation, claiming that Gordon did not inform them of Snyder's joining the production in 2005.<ref name="horn"/>

Fox alleged that it contacted Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, and told the studio that it had violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay that formed the basis of the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge.<ref name="horn"/>

On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's claim to a copyright interest in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/business/media/25fox.html|title=Judge Says Fox Owns Rights to a Warner Movie|author=MICHAEL CIEPLY|work=[[New York Times]]|date=2008-12-25|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref> An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of ''Watchmen''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i2f608e22d68972d4c6a6b7e72b2048cf|title=Fox will fight for 'Watchmen' delay|journal=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-12-29|accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered the chance to make ''Watchmen''.
