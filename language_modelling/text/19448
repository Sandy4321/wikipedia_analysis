The '''Chicago 2016 Olympic bid''' is the attempt by the city of [[Chicago]] and the [[United States]]<U+2014>with the support of municipalities in the [[Tri-state region]] of [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Wisconsin]]<U+2014>to be selected by the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) as the host city for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. 

On April 14, 2007, Chicago was selected as the United States Bid city, and on June 4, 2008, the IOC named Chicago as one of four finalists to host the 2016 Olympic games. The final selection will be made on [[October 2]] [[2009]], in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. 
Currently, Chicago's rival cities for the hosting of the Games are [[Madrid 2016 Olympic bid|Madrid]], [[Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic bid|Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]; and [[Tokyo 2016 Olympic bid|Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. If Chicago is chosen, the games would be held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and August 28.

The bid plan emphasizes use of [[Chicago Park District]] parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as [[Soldier Field]] and [[McCormick Place]] will host events.  The bid includes a plan for North side, downtown [[Loop (Chicago)|Loop]] and [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] celebration locations that will have [[JumboTron]]s for unticketed visitors.  The bid notes that there is a very high concentration of event locations and training facilities in very close proximity to each other and that the majority of event sites are clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes will be close to their competitions.

==USOC city selection==
Initially, five United States cities expressed interest in bidding for the 2016 Olympics: [[Chicago]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and [[San Francisco]]. The USOC's chairman at the time and Chicago native, [[Peter Ueberroth]], visited potential host cities during April and May 2006. He visited Chicago on May 10. On July 26, 2006, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) narrowed its list of applicant cities to three: Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.<ref name="USOC shortlist">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1153946761 |title=Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco On USOC 2016 Olympic Bid Short List |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |date=[[2006-07-26]] |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref> San Francisco withdrew its application on November 13, 2006.<ref name="San Francisco quits">{{cite news |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1163447302 |title=San Francisco Reluctantly Withdraws 2016 Olympic Bid |publisher=GamesBids |date=[[2006-11-13]] |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

Both have been registered by entrepreneur Stephen Frayne, Jr., an [[MBA]] student at the [[Kellogg School of Management]], who claimed the domains in 2004, as well as up to 40 other domain names with a similar city/year format which mimics the way Olympic Games are marketed.<ref name=ObtvfWs>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12348C81577EC928&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Olympic bid team vying for Web site - NU graduate student defends right to own Chicago2016.com|accessdate=2009-03-27|date=2008-09-18|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Bergen, Kathy}}</ref> Frayne's stated intent for the site is a "comprehensive, balanced discussion" of the benefits and pitfalls of holding the Olympics in Chicago; the Chicago 2016 committee contends that his real intent is to profit from [[cybersquatting]].<ref name="reader080925">{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/chicago2016site/|title=Chicago 2016: Who Owns the Conversation?| author=Buitrago, Katie | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | date = 2008-09-25 | accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> The Chicago Olympic bid organization, which has been using Chicago2016.org as its official web site, sought control of Chicago2016.com through a complaint filed with an international arbitration organization.<ref name=ObtvfWs/> Attempts by the USOC to have the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) release the names have failed.<ref name=Dot-Com-troversy/>  Frayne brought suit in U.S. District Court in Chicago, seeking an injunction against the arbitration proceedings.<ref name=ObtvfWs/>  On September 25, 2008, the WIPO arbitration panel granted Frayne's [[Motion (legal)|motion]] to suspend and terminate proceedings setting up a battle in the federal court in the Northern District of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=12372B4A114FAFB8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=NU grad student wins round in fight to keep Olympic site|accessdate=2009-03-27|date=2008-09-26|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Thomas, Mike}}</ref>

The Olympic bid candidature documentation published by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) states that each bid must "...provide documentation indicating that appropriate measures have been taken to register domain names that are of value to your candidature such as '[City] 2016' followed by extensions .com .net .org as well as the country code concerned."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rudern.de/uploads/media/2016_CANDIDATURE_PROCEDURE_AND_QUESTIONNAIRE.pdf|title=2016 Candidature Procedure and Questionnaire|accessdate=2009-03-27|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|date=June 2008}}</ref>

==Outlook==
As expected, Chicago made the Candidate city shortlist in June 2008 as one of four finalists to host the 2016 Olympic games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-chicago-2016-olympics-finalist,0,6779343.story|accessdate=2008-06-04|date=2008-06-04|title=Chicago one of four finalists for 2016 Olympics|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Its technical ranking by the IOC was 7.0; generally beyond the 6.0 minimum threshold, but trailing behind Tokyo and Madrid's bids.

USOC head Peter Ueberroth has contended that Chicago is in "third or fourth place", with a need to focus more on the international relations rather than just having a strong technical bid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1191523107|title=USOC Head Says Chicago 2016 Needs To Change Emphasis|accessdate=2009-04-22|date=2007-10-04|publisher=Games Bids Inc.}}</ref>  Nevertheless, with Chicago's strong hosting of the [[2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships|AIBA Boxing Championships]]<ref name=Style/> which exposed the city to many IOC members, the city was cited as a current favorite, and one member claims the Games are "theirs to lose."<ref name=Interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?category=1&id=1199568691|title=IOC Member Assesses Olympic Bids|accessdate=2009-04-22|date=2008-01-05|publisher=Games Bids Inc.}}</ref> Chicago also successfully hosted the [[Gay Games VII|2006 Gay Games]], another multinational sporting event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1130D4A4C9E49BA8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Shaky start, strong finish - Despite early glitches, organizers, athletes found their stride in a welcoming host city |accessdate=2009-03-27|date=2006-07-23|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Noel, Josh and Ray Quintanilla}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1130D981DA3EE710&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Over and out: Gay Games end: Chicago emerges with enhanced reputation as progressive, many say |accessdate=2009-03-27|date=2006-07-23|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|author=Hussain, Rummana}}</ref> Both events were planned with short lead times.

Although there is no official IOC rotation policy, the Americas have an edge to host since previous games will have been held in Asia, Europe, and Australia: [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]], [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], and [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney]]. Besides Chicago, candidate city [[Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic bid|Rio]] also has the advantage of being located in the Americas, as well as the additional factor of being in [[South America]], a region which has never hosted an Olympics.  Although not as strong in infrastructure, Rio is identified as a "dark horse" that may surprise its competitors.<ref name=Interview/>

Chicago may also have hurdles in overcoming animosity in a long standing dispute with the IOC, some [[List of IOC members|IOC members]] also resent the large share of revenue taken by the United States Olympic Committee;<ref>Phillip Hersh, ''Chicago Tribune'', "Chicago in 8-City Race for Olympics", Sept 13, 2007</ref> the USOC has recently made headway in negotiating progress for a viable solution.  Additionally, the [[Controversies at the 2006 World Baseball Classic#Conflict_with_the_United_States_government|controversy]] over the participation of [[Cuba national baseball team|Team Cuba]] in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]] is seen to hurt America's chances.
