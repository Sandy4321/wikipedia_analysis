Before becoming a professional wrestler, Henry was a weightlifter, and competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, where he placed tenth in the super heavyweight division. Three years later, at the [[1995 Pan American Games]], Henry won a silver medal in the super heavyweight division. The following year, he became a North America, Central America, Caribbean Islands (NACACI) champion. Also in 1996, Henry signed a ten-year contract with the WWF.

Henry was trained by former Canadian professional wrestlers [[Stu Hart|Stu]] and [[Bret Hart]] and [[Leo Burke]]. He made his television wrestling debut in September 1996. In January 1998, Henry joined the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] [[Nation of Domination]]. After the disbanding of the group, he acquired the moniker "Sexual Chocolate", which led him to participate in controversial angles. In 2000, Henry was sent to the company's developmental territory [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW) in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] to improve his wrestling skills. That same year, he left wrestling and began focusing on weightlifting. Henry won a strongman competition, during the [[Arnold Classic]] in 2002.

In 2003, Henry returned to WWE, where he took part of the group "Thuggin' And Buggin' Enterprises", a group compiled of African Americans who worked a race angle in which they felt they were victims of racism and were being held down by the "white man". The following year, Henry tore his [[quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps muscle]], and was unable to compete for over a year. Upon his return, he was briefly involved in feuds with [[Kurt Angle]] and [[The Undertaker]], before suffering a knee injury. After it healed, he continued to feud with The Undertaker, before being moved to the ECW brand in June 2008, where he gained [[Tony Atlas]] as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]]. In June 2008, he won the ECW Championship and he held it for three months. In 2011, Henry had a resurgence on SmackDown, which led to him winning his first World Heavyweight Championship in September 2011.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE===
====Early career (1996<U+2013>1997)====
