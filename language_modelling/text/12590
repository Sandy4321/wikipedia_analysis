Her father is from the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]] and belongs to [[Thathal|Thothal]]-[[Rajput]] [[Caste]], while her mother is a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] from Afghanistan belonging to the [[Durrani]] tribe.
At the time of her pregnancy, Deeyah's mother was only 18-years old and could not speak the [[Norwegian language]]. She found a nurse in an elderly [[India]]n woman(nanny) who helped her through her pregnancy and labour. The elderly lady picked the name Deepika for the child.

Proud of his familial tribal ancestry and heritage, Deeyah's father dropped his last name [[Hussain]] for Thathaal in his mid-20s when he migrated to Norway. Towards the end of 1970s, he established an organisation called the ''R<U+0101>ga Music Society'' celebrating [[R<U+0101>ga]], the most basic arrangement of notes in [[Hindustani classical music|Pakistani classical music]], and to introduce [[Demographics of Pakistan|Pakistani]] artists and music styles to the [[Norway|Norwegian]] musical and cultural sphere.

===Deeyah's music training===
Deeyah's father was a music enthusiast. Through his musical organisation, he invited classical musical maestros from [[Pakistan]] to teach music to young people. He ensured that music became an essential part of both of his children's upbringing and in 1984 entrusted his seven year old daughter under the supervision of [[Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan]]. Deeyah studied [[Music of Pakistan|Pakistani]] and [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical]] forms of music under the grand maestro who would later declare her amongst his favourites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Khan was aware of the talent the little girl held in herself and urged her to openly sing in public. The following year, at the age of eight, Deeyah made her first performance on national television appearing on the [[primetime]] show ''Halv Sju''. She would later perform at various festivals and celebrated as the youngest performer at major music festivals. [[Ustad Bade Fateh Ali Khan]] taught her the intricacies of the instruments used under the ''[[Patiala gharana]]'' and ''[[Ghazal]]'', ''[[Thumri]]'' and ''[[Khyal]]'' forms of classical music. She would usually accompany other maestros on the ''[[tanpura]]'', among them [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], Pandit [[Shivkumar Sharma]], Ustad Shaukat Hussain Khan. Deeyah was also the member of [[NRK]] girls choir as well receiving some music lessons with the late African American soprano [[Anne Brown]]. Deeyah also spent some years receiving further musical training from Ustad [[Sultan Khan (musician)|Sultan Khan]].<ref>

==Music career==
===Early Music Career===
From the beginning of her career Deeyah has been called a limitless and ground-breaking artist.
<ref>1991 Newspaper article about Deeyah breaking down boundaries of musical genres and cultural and societal barriers of perceptions placed on a young Muslim girl born in Norway-tipping her for great things in her career http://www.deeyahpoint.co.uk/nor/no/boundaryxa8.jpg By Dagbladet</ref>
She has been singing on national television since childhood. At the age of 12 she was invitied by [[Polygram Records]] producers to sing a duet with artist [[Anders Wyller]], this collaboration becoming Deeyah's first studio recording experience. She was signed at the age of 13. Her talent was recognised nationally in 1992 when she sang at the opening ceremony for [[Norway]]s
[[TV 2 (Norway)|TV2]] channel in front of an audience that included [[<U+00C5>se Kleveland]] then minister of culture and Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. At the age of 15 Deeyah's debut solo album ''I Alt Slags Lys'' was released under the Norway-based independent recording giant [[Kirkelig Kulturverksted]]. The album was a fusion of Pakistani classical sounds with modern influences
<ref>[http://www.deeyahpoint.co.uk/nor/no/spreeiz8.jpg mixed various Pakistani musical styles with jazz and western folk music]</ref>
and featured many a prominent ''ustads'' including her mentors. She also collaborated with [[Knut Reiersrud]], Reidar Sk<U+00E5>r, [[Paolo Vinaccia]], Audun Erlien, [[Sultan Khan (musician)|Ustad Sultan Khan]] and Ustad [[Shaukat Hussain Khan]] from Pakistan

''I Alt Slags Lys'' received broad critical acclaim. [[Talvin Singh]] accompanied Deeyah on [[Tabla]] on her national tour as a stand in for Ustad shaukat Hussain Khan who's health did not allow him to tour. It was at this point during Deeyah's early success that Norwegian-Pakistani community criticized her family encouragement of her musical career. The community felt it was inappropriate for a young Muslim woman to perform music.

===Deepika (album)===
Deeyah's second solo album came out in September 1995 under contract with [[BMG]]/[[Arista Records|Arista]].<ref>[http://www.deeyahpoint.co.uk/nor/no/overdh4.jpg 2nd album]</ref> This album was released under her birth name and was titled Deepika. The album was produced by Norwegian [[Tor Erik Hermansen]], [[Tommy Tee]] and English producer Nick Sillitoe.

The album received critical acclaim and produced chart success for Deeyah, giving her music video high rotation making her a prominent name in Norwegian mainstream music scene. One of the  [[music videos]] from this album caused uproar among conservative Muslims who claimed Deeyah was misleading Muslim women by showing her uncovered back.

Her family continued to support her despite increased pressure and violent threats due to her growing presence in the media because of her music. Eventually, Deeyah faced these threats directly when several men tried to abduct her from school grounds to "talk to her". Intervention by several male students saved her from being taken away. A year later Deeyah was attacked on stage and sprayed with pepper gas during a live performance. At age of 16, after continued harassment and fearing for her family and personal safety, Deeyah left [[Norway]] for [[United Kingdom]].

Two year later, Deeyah was given a recording contract by the [[Chairman]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[Rob Dickens]]. Few year later, when Rob Dickens has to leave the job, his  recent signings (including Deeyah) were released from their contracts. A year after that Deeyah's manager, Steven Fargnoli, passed away from [[colon cancer]]. Deeyah was left on her own again.

===Deeyah collaborations and being sampled===
During her time in [[London]], Deeyah has collaborated with artists, musicians and producers across musical genres from Pakistani folk to North Indian Classical, to Western [[Jazz]], [[Electronica]] and chart [[Pop music|Pop]] music. Deeyah has been sampled by several artists on their album projects including [[Nils Petter Molv<U+00E6>r]], [[Seb Taylor]], [[Novel (musician)|Novel]], [[Bone Crusher (rapper)|Bonecrusher]], [[Janet Jackson]] (remix), [[Liquid Stranger]], [[Masaladosa]], [[Mark Smith (musician <U+2013> producer)|Mark Smith]], Futility Orchestra, [[Guy Chambers]] and Kaya Project.

===Plan of My Own===
Two year following the passing of her manager, Deeyah managed to finish an album in her own home studio. Her first single "Plan of My Own" went to number one on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]], receiving high rotation on several music channels as well as the Asian music channels [[B4U Music]] and [[Zee Tv]].<ref>[http://designermagazine.tripod.com/DeeyahINT1.html Interview with Designer Magazine]</ref> Controversy, reminiscent of her problems in Norway, immediately ensued

small parts of the local [[Muslim]] community expressed outrage and put pressure on the channels to remove the video. Fearing similar violence she faced in Norawy, and after receiving threars, deeyah stopped plans for the release of her album.

The organisation that called for the banning of the [[Salman Rushdie]] [[satanic verses]] in the UK, [[Muslim Council of Britain]] questioned Deeyah's account of her threats and later accuse Deeyah of being a [[Hindu]] because of her birth name of Deepika",

This was dispelled in a [[CNN]] interview where Deeyah explained that she was named by a woman who had helped her mother during childbirth as well as deeyah's heritage being public in Norwegian media since she was eight year old.

===What Will It Be?===
With growing frustration and anger towards the orthodox segments of the Muslim community, Deeyah responded with the song and music video [[What Will It Be]]. The music video for What Will It Be was filmed in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. In what was to become the infamous [[burkah]] to [[bikini]] scene, the video spurred more outrage in the already sensitive Muslim community. Her video was banned by [[B4U Music|B4U]] in [[England]] after the network offices were threatened with violence.<ref>

In the video, Deeyah depicts two seemingly opposing images of morality and femininity: the burkah and the bikini.

Deeyah explained her personal stance to be that of <U+201C>non-judgment<U+201D>. She does not endorse either end of the spectrum, but rather points out the right of each woman to choose. Deeyah did not allow "What Will It Be" to be released, but after many requests from fans, made it available for limited digital download in the UK only.
