'''Jan Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Forman''' (born [[February 18]], [[1932]]), better known as '''Milo<U+0161> Forman''', is a [[film director]], [[actor]] and script writer.

Forman was born in [[<U+010C><U+00E1>slav]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (now [[<U+010C><U+00E1>slav]], [[Czech Republic]]) to a [[Jewish]] father and a [[Protestant]] mother. He was orphaned at a very young age when his parents died at the [[concentration camp]] in [[Auschwitz]]; his father was imprisoned due to membership in a [[Occupation of Czechoslovakia#Czech Resistance|Czech Resistance]] group, his mother imprisoned for  dealing in illegal grocery trade. Forman writes in his autobiography that both death sentences were issued by a German who had worked for them, and Forman believes he wanted revenge for having been subservient to what he thought were racially-lower Czechs.

After the war, Milo<U+0161> attended King George College public school in the spa town [[Podebrady|Pod<U+011B>brady]], where his fellow students were [[V<U+00E1>clav Havel]] and the [[Masin|Ma<U+0161><U+00ED>n brothers]]. Later on he studied film direction at the [[Academy of Performing Arts in Prague]]. He directed several [[Czech language|Czech]] comedies in [[Czechoslovakia]].  However, in [[1968]] when the [[USSR]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies invaded the country to end the [[Prague Spring]], he was in [[Paris]] negotiating for the production of his first American film. 

The Czech studio that he worked for fired him, claiming that he was out of the country illegally. He moved to [[New York]], where he later became a professor of film at [[Columbia University]] and co-chair (with [[Frantisek Daniel]]) of Columbia's film division. One of his proteges was future director [[James Mangold]], who had advised the young filmmaker about scriptwriting.

In spite of initial difficulties, he started directing in his new home country, and achieved success in 1975 with the adaptation of [[Ken Kesey]]'s novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', which won five [[Academy Awards]] including one for direction. In 1977, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]]. Another notable success was ''[[Amadeus]]'', which won eight [[Academy Awards]]. His later movies haven't enjoyed as much success.  

Forman's early movies are still very popular among [[Czechs]]. Many of the situations and phrases made it into common use: for example, the Czech term ''zhasnout'' (''to switch lights off'') from ''[[The Firemen's Ball]]'', associated with petty theft in the movie, has been used to describe the large-scale asset stripping happening in the country during the 1990s.

In 1997 he received the [[Crystal Globe]] award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]].

Forman co-starred alongside [[Edward Norton]] in the actor's directorial debut ''[[Keeping the Faith]]'' (2000) as the wise friend to Norton's young, conflicted [[priest]].

Forman's two sons [[Petr Forman]] and [[Mat<U+011B>j Forman]] are also movie and theatre actors.
