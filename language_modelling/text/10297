'''Cassidy International Airport''' {{airport codes|CXI|PLCH}} is an [[airport]] located north of [[Banana, Kiribati|Banana]], [[Kiritimati]], [[Kiribati]]. It's the second international [[list of airports in Kiribati|airport of Kiribati]], the only one with a [[North America]]n destination and the only airport in the Kiribatian part of the [[Line Islands]] with [[IATA airport code|IATA]] and/or [[ICAO airport code|ICAO code]]. Since [[Air Kiribati]] doesn't own aircraft capable to fly between the [[Gilbert Islands]] (where all other operational airports in Kiribati are located) and the remote other islands, there are no domestic flights to and from Kiritimati.
