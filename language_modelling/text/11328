'''Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase''', most commonly known by the shorter name '''RuBisCO''', is an [[enzyme]] ({{EC number|4.1.1.39}}) that is used in the [[Calvin cycle]] to catalyze the first major step of [[carbon fixation]], a process by which the [[atom]]s of atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] are made available to [[organism]]s in the form of [[fuel|energy-rich]] [[molecule]]s such as [[sucrose]]. RuBisCO catalyzes either the [[carboxylation]] or [[oxygenation]] of [[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate]] (also known as ''RuBP'') with carbon dioxide or [[oxygen]].

RuBisCO is very important in terms of [[biology|biological]] impact because it catalyzes the most commonly used [[chemical reaction]] by which [[inorganic]] [[carbon]] enters the [[biosphere]]. RuBisCO is apparently the most abundant protein in [[leaf|leaves]], and it may be the most abundant [[protein]] on Earth{{ref|abundant}}. Given its important role in the biosphere, there are currently efforts to "improve on [[nature]]" and [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineer]] crop plants so as to contain more efficient RuBisCO (see [[#Genetic engineering|below]]).

==Structure==
In plants, [[algae]], [[cyanobacteria]], and [[phototropic]] and [[Chemotroph|chemoautotropic]] [[proteobacteria]] the enzyme usually consists of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain ('''L''', about 55,000 [[Atomic mass unit|Da]]) and the small chain ('''S''', about 13,000 Da){{ref|genes}}. The enzymatically active [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] ([[ribulose]] 1,5-bisphosphate) [[active site|binding site]]s are located in the large [[polymer|chain]]s that form [[dimer]]s as shown in Figure 1 (above, right) in which [[amino acid]]s from each large chain contribute to the binding sites. A total of four large chain dimers and eight small chains assemble into a larger complex of about 540,000 Da{{ref|biochemistry}}. In some proteobacteria and dinofagellates, enzymes consisting of only large subunits have been found {{ref|bacterial}}.

[[Magnesium]] [[ion]]s (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) are needed for enzymatic activity. Correct positioning of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the [[active site]] of the enzyme involves addition of an "activating" carbon dioxide molecule ([[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]) to a [[lysine]] in the active site (forming a [[carbamate]]){{ref|magnesium}}. Formation of the carbamate is favored by an [[alkalinity|alkaline]] [[pH]]. The pH and the [[concentration]] of magnesium ions in the fluid compartment (in plants, the [[Chloroplast|stroma of the chloroplast]]{{ref|location}}) increases in the light. The role of changing pH and magnesium ion levels in the regulation of RuBisCO enzyme activity is discussed [[#Regulation of its Enzymatic Activity|below]].

==Enzymatic Activity==
[[Image:calvin-cycle3.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Figure 2'''. Overview of the [[Calvin cycle]] and carbon fixation]]
As shown in Figure 2 (left), RuBisCO is one of many enzymes in the [[Calvin cycle]].<BR>
'''Substrates'''. During carbon fixation, the substrate molecules for RuBisCO are [[Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate|ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]], [[carbon dioxide]] (distinct from the "activating" carbon dioxide) and [[Water (molecule)|water]] {{ref|reaction}}. RuBisCO can also allow a reaction to occur with [[oxygen|molecular oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) instead of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). <BR>
'''Products'''. When carbon dioxide is the substrate, the product of the carboxylase reaction is 3-phosphoglycerate. The 3-phosphoglycerate can be used to produce larger molecules such as [[glucose]]. When molecular oxygen is the substrate, the products of the oxygenase reaction are phosphoglycolate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Phosphoglycolate initiates a sequence of reactions called [[photorespiration]] which involves enzymes located in the [[mitochondria]] and [[peroxisomes]].  In this process, two molecules of phosphoglycolate are converted to one molecule of carbon dioxide and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate, which can reenter the Calvin cycle. Some of the phosphoglycolate entering this pathway can be retained by plants to produce other molecules such as [[glycine]]. At air levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, the ratio of the reactions is about 4 to 1, which results in a net carbon dioxide fixation of only 3.5. Thus the inability of the enzyme to prevent the reaction with oxygen greatly reduces the photosynthetic potential of many plants. Some plants and many algae and photosynthetic bacteria have overcome this limitation by devising means to increase the concentration of carbon dioxide around the enzyme, including [[C4 carbon fixation]], [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] and using [[pyrenoid]].

'''Rate of enzymatic activity'''. Some enzymes can carry out thousands of chemical reactions each second. RuBisCO is slow, being able to "fix" only a few carbon dioxide molecules each second. Under most conditions and when light is not otherwise limiting photosynthesis, RuBisCO is the primary rate-limiting enzyme of the Calvin cycle.

===Regulation of its Enzymatic Activity===

RuBisCO is usually only active during the day because ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is not being produced in the dark due to the regulation of several other enzymes in the Calvin cycle. In addition, the activity of Rubisco is coordinated with that of the other enzymes of the Calvin cycle in several ways:

#'''Regulation by ions'''. Upon illumination of the chloroplasts, the [[pH]] of the [[stroma]] rises from 7.0 to 8.0 because of the proton (hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>) gradient created across the [[thylakoid]] membrane{{ref|ions}}. At the same time, magnesium ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) move out of the thylakoids, increasing the concentration of magnesium in the stroma of the chloroplasts. RuBisCO has a high optimal pH (can be >9.0, depending on the magnesium ion concentration) and thus becomes "activated" by the addition of carbon dioxide and magnesioum to the active sites as described above.  
#'''Regulation by activase'''. In plants and some algae, another enzyme, [[RuBisCO activase]]{{ref|activase1}} is required to allow the rapid formation of the critical carbamate in the active site of RuBisCO{{ref|activase2}}. Activase is required because the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate binds more strongly to the active sites lacking the carbamate and markedly slows down the "activation" process. In the light, RuBisCO activase promotes the release of the inhibitory ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate from the catalytic sites. Activase is also required in some plants (e.g. tobacco and many beans) because in darkness, RuBisCO is inhibited by a competitive inhibitor synthesized by these plants, a substrate analog 2-Carboxy-D-arabitinol 1-phosphate (CA1P){{ref|CA1P}}. CA1P binds tightly to the active site of carbamylated RuBisCO and inhibits catalytic activity. In the light, RuBisCO activase also promotes the release of CA1P from the catalytic sites. After the CA1P is released from RuBisCO, it is rapidly converted to a non-inhibitory form by a light-activated [[CA1P-phosphatase]]. Finally, once every several hundred reactions, the normal reactions with carbon dioxide or oxygen are not completed and other inhibitory substrate analogs are formed in the active site.  Once again, RuBisCO activase can promote the release of these analogs from the catalytic sites and maintain the enzyme in a catalytically active form. The properties of activase limit the photosynthetic potential of plants at high temperatures {{ref|heat}}. CA1P has also been shown to keep Rubisco in a [[Chemical conformation|conformation]] that is protected from [[protease|proteolysis]]{{ref|protease}}. 
#'''Regulation by ATP/ADP and stromal reduction/oxidation state through the activase'''. The removal of the inhibitory RuBP, CA1P, and the other inhibitory substrate analogs by activase requires the consumption of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. This reaction is inhibited by the presence of [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and thus activase activity depends on the ratio of these compounds in the chloroplast stroma. Furthermore in most plants, the sensitivity of activase to the ratio of ATP/ADP is modified by the stromal reduction/oxidation ([[redox]]) state through another small regulatory protein, [[thioredoxin]]. In this manner, the activity of activase and the activation state of Rubisco can be modulated in response to light intensity and thus the rate of formation of the ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate substrate{{ref|redox}}. 
#'''Regulation by phosphate'''. Inorganic [[phosphate]] (P<sub>i</sub>) participates in the co-ordinated regulation of photosynthesis. P<sub>i</sub> binds to the RuBisCO active site and to another site on the large chain where it can influence transitions between activated and less active conformations of the enzyme. Activation of bacterial RuBisCO might be particularly sensitive to P<sub>i</sub> levels{{ref|phosphate}}.
#'''Regulation by carbon dioxide'''. Since carbon dioxide and oxygen [[Enzyme inhibitor|compete]] at the active site of RuBisCO, carbon fixation by RuBisCO can be enhanced by increasing the carbon dioxide level in the compartment containing RuBisCO (chloroplast stroma). Several times during the evolution of plants, mechanisms have evolved for increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the stroma (see [[C4 carbon fixation]]). The use of oxygen as a substrate is an apparently-puzzling process, since it seems to throw away captured energy. However it may be a mechanism for preventing overload during periods of high light flux. C<sub>4</sub> plants use the enzyme [[C4 carbon fixation|PEP carboxylase]] initially, which has a higher affinity for CO<sub>2</sub>. The process first makes a 4-carbon intermediate compound; hence the name C<sub>4</sub> plants.

[[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) plants keep their stomata (on the underside of the leaf) closed during the day, which conserves water but prevents photosynthesis, which requires CO<sub>2</sub> to pass by gas exchange through these openings. Evaporation through the upper side of a leaf is prevented by a layer of wax.

===Genetic engineering===
Since RuBisCO is often rate limiting for photosynthesis in plants, it may be possible to improve photosynthetic efficiency by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase its catalytic activity and/or decrease the rate of the oxygenation activity{{ref|engineer2}}. Approaches that have begun to be investigated include expressing RuBisCO genes from one organism in another organism, increasing the level of expression of RuBisCO subunits, expressing RuBisCO small chains from the chloroplast DNA, and altering RuBisCO genes so as to try to increase specificity for carbon dioxide or otherwise increase the rate of carbon fixation{{ref|engineer}}.

One particularly interesting avenue is to introduce rubiscos with naturally high specificity values such as the ones from the red algae ''Galdieria partita'' into plants. This would be expected to improve the photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants {{ref|engineer3}}. Important advances in this area include the replacement of the tobacco enzyme with that of the purple photosynthetic bacterium ''Rhodospirillum rubrum'' {{ref|engineer4}}.
