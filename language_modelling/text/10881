The new ''Pennsylvania Cut-off'' diverged from the line (now today's [[Northeast Corridor]]) at Waverly Yard, crossed the [[Newark Ironbound]] and the Passaic to the [[Kearny Meadows]] and then crossed the [[Hackensack River]] on the Harsimus Branch Lift Bridge. It rejoined the main line at the [[Bergen Hill Cut]], but diverged again using the [[Harsimus Stem Embankment]] to reach its freight yards on the [[Hudson Waterfront|Hudson River waterfront]] north of its passenger terminal at [[Exchange Place (PRR station)|Exchange Place]]. The PRR also used the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge]] to reach its [[car float]] operations at [[Greenville Yard]] on the [[Upper New York Bay]].<ref name = extensions/>
