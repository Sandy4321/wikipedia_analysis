'''''Curse of Enchantia''''' is a [[comedy]]-[[fantasy]] [[graphic adventure game]] developed and released by the British video game company [[Core Design]] for the PC [[DOS]] and [[Amiga]] in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]]. The game tells the story of Brad, a young teenager who has been summoned from modern Earth to the magical world of Enchantia, where he needs to find a way to break the titular [[curse]] and get back home. 

''Curse of Enchantia'' was the first attempt by Core Design in the adventure genre. It uses some highly unconventional and controversial game mechanics for an [[adventure game]] title from that era, featuring many simple [[action game]] style sequences and lacking in-game text. 

The game was generally well received upon its release, especially by the Amiga magazines. Its successor, ''[[Universe (1994 video game)|Universe]]'', was released by Core Design in 1994.

== Gameplay ==
''Curse of Enchantia'' uses a [[point and click]] [[user interface]], similar to the ''[[King's Quest]]'' series.<ref name=cua/> The [[player character]] is commanded with an [[computer icon|icon]] based control bar that is accessible by pressing the right mouse button, which also pauses the game. The control bar features seven main actions: inventory, pick up/take, manipulate/use (opening up a sub-menu with eight further actions: unlock, insert, push/pull, eat, wear, throw, give and combine), look, talk (only either "Help!" or "Hi!"), attack and jump. Usually, the protagonist has to stand in the immediate vicinity to the game's objects and characters, which then appear as icons in a separate bar, in order to interact with them. A [[joystick]] or [[computer keyboard]] input can also be used.<ref name=man>''Curse of Enchantia'' game manual by Robert Toone and Kevin Norburn</ref>

The game does not feature text-based object descriptions or conversations, and its few short scenes of dialogue use a minimalist system of [[pictogram]]s in comic book-style [[speech balloon]]s. Core Design's Ian Sabine stated that the lack of text "speeds up gameplay".<ref name=over>''Computer Gaming World'' 99, page 84: "Over There: enCore! enCore!"</ref> Instead, the game has several [[action game|action]]-style sequences, like dodging hazards or timing the use of items. However, the character is never at risk of dying and thus every "dangerous" task can be repeated until successfully completed, risking only losing a few points from the [[Score (game)|score]].<ref name=cua/> Designer Rob Toone said that the idea behind this concept was to make these parts of the game "interesting without being difficult."<ref name=one/> Objects such as jewels and coins can be collected throughout the game for a higher score.<ref name=man/>

== Plot ==
[[File:Curse of Enchantia gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A screenshot of the PC version of ''Curse of Enchantia'' (final battle). Several [[Amiga]] magazines praised the game's "wonderful graphics",<ref name=ac/> "splendid visual style"<ref name=one/> and "beautifully drawn world of magic and adventure."<ref name=cua/>]]

The game takes place in the [[fairy tale]] realm of Enchantia, under the cruel and depraved rule of a [[coven]] of wicked [[witchcraft|witches]]. The worst and most powerful of them seeks a male child from another dimension as the major ingredient of her desired [[Elixir of life|spell of eternal youth]]. For this purpose, she has acquired the sorcery of all the other witches and created a [[Portals in fiction|portal]] connecting to Earth in order to catch a boy there. One day in 20th century<ref name=over/> Earth, Brad, the game's teenage hero, suddenly vanishes during a [[baseball]] practice with his sister Jenny. He is transported through time and space to Enchantia and imprisoned in the dungeons underneath the witch's castle, where he is to be held until she is ready for the rejuvenation spell. However, Brad, not giving up, escapes and then sets out on a journey to return home safely. In the course of his surreal adventure, he braves various dangers and meets a host of friendly and hostile characters - including [[talking animal]]s, monsters and other creatures - and rises to become an unlikely hero who can end the witches' reign.<ref name=cua/><ref name=man/>

The game begins with Brad hanging upside down in manacles while dressed in medieval clothing. Escaping from the cell, he falls into a moat before coming to a halt in a maze of an underground cavern. Reaching the surface, he arrives at a village, which is then sealed-off by guards. This location is repeatedly revisited throughout the game, as Brad returns here after traveling to the various corners of Enchantia: including a mountain cliff, a labyrinth-like palace of the ice witch, and a volcanic junkyard island, all the while searching for items - a [[vacuum cleaner]], a [[fire extinguisher]] and a [[mechanical fan]] - to use in the final showdown predicted by a fortune-telling seal. In the end, a friendly wizard [[Teleportation|teleports]] him into a grave of a haunted cemetery just outside his ultimate destination: the castle of the queen of witches. Inside, Brad needs to confront and defeat the witch by countering her attacks in a battle of [[black magic]] against modern technology. Once the bane of Enchantia is destroyed, the boy accomplishes his quest and he is instantly transported back to the baseball field where it all started.<ref>Keith Grabban, "Giving the game away: Curse of Enchantia", ''Amiga Action'' 41 (February 1993), pages 78-81</ref><ref name=walk>Tim Tucker, ''Amiga Power'' 21-23 (the game walthrough in three parts)</ref><ref>R.

''Curse of Enchantia'' was described as "a funny version of ''[[Lure of the Temptress]]'' with a different plot."<ref name=app>Stuart Campbell, "Things to come: Curse of Enchantia", ''Amiga Power'' 17 (September 1992), page 20</ref> Its story was partially inspired by ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]'',<ref name=cua>Tony Gill, [http://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/curseofe.htm "Braving wicked witches and shark infested waters"], ''CU Amiga'', November 1992, pages 72-73</ref> and relies heavily on [[absurd humor]]. It contains several [[Easter egg]] references, including the shop called "[[Mr. Ben|Benn's Costume Shop]]"<ref name=cua/> (complete with a costume of [[Batman]]), a band named "[[The Beatles|The Slugs]]" (formed of four humanoid slugs), getting into a frozen land [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|through a wardrobe]], and the wreck of ''[[J.

Versions of the game for both the PC and the Amiga were developed separately and simultaneously, in order to make the best possible product for each platform, rather than a quick [[Game port|port]] from one system to another.<ref name=one/> The original idea for the game was an [[action-adventure game|action adventure]] similar to ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]''.<ref name=cup>"First impressions: Curse of Enchantia", ''CU Amiga'', July 1992, page 43</ref> Its original working title was ''Zeloria'',<ref name=cup/> which later caused some confusion as several magazines continued to use "Zeloria" as the name of the land in the game;<ref name=ac>Jonathan Maddock, "Let's do the time warp...", ''Amiga Computing'' 55 (December 1992), pages 129-130</ref><ref name=af/><ref name=theone>David Upchurch, "Review: Curse of Enchantia", ''The One Amiga'' 50 (November 1992), pages 68-70</ref><ref name=onep>''The One Amiga'' 46 (July 1992), page 119</ref> at least one magazine also incorrectly took Enchantia to be the name of the antagonist.<ref>''G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ration 4'' 52 ([http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero052/Page%2006-07.jpg page]) {{fr icon}}</ref> It took a month for the project to be completely [[storyboard]]ed before any programming work started on it.<ref name=one/> While the game's design evolved over time, its original plot remained largely intact.<ref name=cup/>

The game mixes backgrounds hand-drawn with [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]] and then [[Digitizing|digitized]] by the concept artist Rolf Mohr,<ref name=one/><ref name=rm>[http://www.rolfmohr.com/VideoGames_3.html ROLF MOHR: Illustrator &amp; Concept Artist]</ref> and sprite [[bitmap]] graphics made in [[Deluxe Paint]] and [[Brilliance (graphics editor)|Brilliance]] on the Amiga with some [[rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animations.<ref name=rolf/> There were "huge" DPaint-made character animation sequences but they had to be put in game in more efficient way.<ref name=app/> Regarding the decision to keep the onscreen text to a minimum, the game's co-designer Amiga version's chief coder Rob Toone said that "too much reading can slow the game or kill it, like ''[[The Adventures of Willy Beamish]]''," with Mohr adding that "hopefully, a picture will say a thousand words and make this system easy to use."<ref name=one>"Work in progress: We need a hero!

There were also several other late changes that resulted in some of the already made graphics and other content being cut from the game. The game was officially revealed by Core at the [[European Computer Trade Show|ECTS]] in April 1992, along with ''[[Darkmere]]'',<ref>[http://www.syntax2000.co.uk/issues/21/ects.asc.txt The Autumn E.C.T.S Report By Richard Hewison]</ref> and was originally planned to be released in September 1992.<ref name=onep/><ref>Brian Sharp, "Blue Print: Curse of Enchantia", ''Amiga Action'' 36 (September 1992), page 56</ref>

Critical reception of ''Curse of Enchantia'' was mixed but mostly positive, especially in regards of its graphics and animation, even as the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers thought was a lack of quality humor, attributing it to the absence of text and dialogue.

British reviewers in particular have often praised the Amiga version of the game. ''[[Amiga Action]]'' gave this "well-made and cleverly constructed package" the Amiga Action Accolade award, calling it "flawless" and "easily the best adventure game on the Amiga to date". It hinted that using a joystick for control may make certain sections of the game "less annoying to play."<ref name=aa/> ''[[Amiga Computing]]'' gave it the Gamer Gold award, calling the game "excellent", "down-right bloody enchanting" and Core Design's "easily...greatest and most impressive game yet," and even advising to "buy it today because if you don't you will more than likely commit suicide, it's that good."<ref name=ac/> ''[[CU Amiga]]'' gave the game the CU Gold Screen award and said that while "some of the puzzles are a bit illogical," "the further into the game you get the more luxurious it becomes. Around each bend the graphics get better and better."<ref name=cua/> ''[[Amiga Power]]'' called it "a classic adventure, which with a few tweaks could have easily beaten the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' [series] and the like. A worthy addition to any collection and will stand as a challenge to any adventurer."<ref name=ap/>

However, ''[[Amiga Format]]'' calling ''Curse of Enchantia'' "light years behind" ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island|Monkey Island]]'' with "no comparison" to ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge|Monkey Island 2]]'', as "the textless interface just doesn't work - despite the designers' belief, you do need words" and there is "no humour to speak of, no genuinely amusing humour, anyway."<ref name=af>Ed Ricketts, "Game Review: Curse of Enchantia", ''Amiga Format'' 41 (December 1992), pages 136-137</ref> ''[[The One Amiga]]'' said that "the game lacks real humour and atmosphere. This may be partly due to the lack of text in the game - it's hard to relate to the characters you meet," and "althrough entertaining, ''Curse of Enchantia'' is to ''Monkey Island 2'' what [[Smash (instant mashed potato)|Smash]] is to [[mashed potato]]," that is "just a weaker substitute."<ref name=theone/>

Giving ''Curse of Enchantia'' a score of 83%, the "absolutely enchanted" reviewer of Australia's ''ACAR'' said the game's "delightful" graphics and animation "are among the most tastefully executed I have ever seen," but noted the problems with its interface system and difficulty.<ref>Ken Simpson, "Curse of Enchantia", ''The Australian Commodore & Amiga Review'' Volume 10 Issue 4 (April 1993), page 73</ref> Australia's ''OZ Amiga'' called it "a light-hearted and funny adventure that appeals to almost everyone" and "one of the better releases of 1993."<ref>Bill Holder, ''OZ Amiga'' Vol 1 No 6 (April - May 1993), page 32</ref> One preview in North American magazine ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' called it a "a pretty looking product" of "a ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]'' / ''[[King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!|KQV]]'' / ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia|Legend of Kyrandia]]'' approach,"<ref>''Computer Gaming World'' 101, page 108: "Over There: Foreign Correspondence"</ref> but another called it "actually more of a multi-screen [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] than a traditional animated adventure," adding that "gamers with a strong penchant for puzzle should find it entertaining" despite its "a bit clumsy" interface.<ref>''Computer Gaming World'' 113, page 266: "Sneak Peak"</ref>

In France, ''Curse of Enchantia'' was given the high ratings of 84% in ''Gen4'' and 91% in ''Joystick''.<ref>''G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ration 4'' 48 (10/92) page 74 {{fr icon}}</ref><ref>''Joystick'' 32 (11/92) page 244 {{fr icon}}</ref> The game also received a score of 79% from Sweden's ''Datormagazin''.<ref>G<U+00F6>ran Fr<U+00F6>jdh, ''Datormagazin'' 1/93 (January 1993), pages 42-43 {{sv icon}}</ref> On the other hand, German magazine ''PC Player'' gave it only 38%, saying that the game may make the players "nostalgic for [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]] titles."<ref>''PC Player'' 1/93 {{de icon}}</ref> It received some relatively low scores from other German magazines, including 79% in ''Amiga Joker'' and 70% (DOS) and 71% (Amiga) in ''Power Play''.<ref>Monika Stoschek, [http://www.amigareviews.leveluphost.com/curseofe.htm "Bunter Hexenkessel: Curse of Enchantia"], ''Amiga Joker'' 12/92 {{de icon}}</ref><ref>Volker Weitz, "Hexensabbat im Computer: Curse of Enchantia", ''Power Play'' 11/92 {{de icon}}</ref> In Poland, it was positively reviewed in ''C&A'' (95%) and ''Secret Service'' (76%),<ref>Bartek "VOYAGER" Dramczyk, ''Commodore & Amiga'' 8/93, pages 14-17 {{pl icon}}</ref><ref>Piotr "micz" Ma<U+0144>kowski, ''Secret Service'' 5/94, pages 44-45 {{pl icon}}</ref> and featured among "the best adventure games" of 1992 (alongside ''[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis|Indiana Jones IV]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Kyrandia]]'') in an adventure issue of ''Computer Studio''.<ref>Mariusz Czarnecki, ''Computer Studio'' 1/93, pages 18-21 {{pl icon}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{main|Universe (1994 video game)}}

A direct [[sequel]] for the game was planned but never released, in part because of Robert Toone's departure from the company. Instead, Core Design released ''Universe'' in 1994 (its working name being ''Curse of Enchantia II''<ref>''Joystick'' 39 (June 1993), [http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joystick/joystick_numero039/page%20096.jpg page 96] {{fr icon}}</ref>), a science fiction adventure game which had a similar user interface, but included in-game text and dialogue. ''Universe'' had a  similar premise, featuring a young man (his name was changed to Boris, but he still had a sister named Jenny<ref>Dave Cusick, "Universe". ''Amiga Computing'' 78, October 1994</ref>) who is transported to another world and has to rid it of an evil overlord. ''Universe'' was the second and last point-and-click adventure developed by Core Design, who then instead concentrated on 3D games for the PC and [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth-generation consoles]], including what would become ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]''. 

''Curse of Enchantia'' also inspired the name of the Polish [[reggae]] band, Enchantia. The band chose the name because they thought it "feels warm".<ref>[http://muzyka.dlastudenta.pl/artykul/Enchantia_czyli_reggae_z_Gdyni,46739.html Enchantia czyli reggae z Gdyni], dlastudenta.pl, 2009-12-29 {{pl icon}}</ref>
