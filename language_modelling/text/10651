The '''Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence''' (also '''Inter-Services Intelligence''' or '''ISI''') is the largest and most powerful intelligence service in Pakistan. It is one of the three main branches of [[Pakistan]]'s [[intelligence agencies]].  

After the poor performance of [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Pakistan's Military Intelligence]] during [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] the need for a separate intelligence body was keenly felt. Inter-Services Intelligence was therefore created as an independent unit in 1948 from the [[Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), which handled intelligence sharing between the different branches of the military as well as external intelligence gathering. Its headquarters was initially located in [[Rawalpindi]] but later it was moved to the newly built capital, [[Islamabad]]. The current director of the organization is Lieutenant General Ashfaq Pervez Kiani. Often alleged to be an invisible force in Pakistani politics and countless incidents around the world, it is one of the most significant and secretive intelligence agencies that exist today. In August 2007, [[Pakistan]]'s Supreme Court, hearing a case of a Pakistan-born German national said the agency is not a law-enforcement agency or a customs authority.<ref>{{cite news

==History==

After independence in 1947, two new intelligence agencies were created in Pakistan called the [[Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB) and [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Military Intelligence]] (MI). However, the weak performance of the MI in sharing intelligence between the Army, Navy and Air Force during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]] led to the creation of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in 1948. The ISI was structured to be manned by officers from the three main military services, and to specialize in the collection, analysis and assessment of external intelligence, either military or non-military. The ISI was the [[brainchild]] of Australian-born British Army officer, Major General R. Cawthome, then Deputy Chief of Staff in the Pakistan Army. Initially, the ISI had no role in the collection of internal intelligence, with the exception of the [[North-West Frontier Province]] and [[Azad Kashmir]]. This however changed in the late 1950s when [[Ayub Khan]] became the President of Pakistan.

Ayub Khan expanded the role of ISI in safeguarding Pakistan<U+2019>s interests, monitoring opposition politicians, and sustaining military rule in Pakistan. The ISI was reorganised in 1966 after intelligence failures in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], and expanded in 1969. Ayub Khan suspected the loyalty of the [[East Pakistan]] based officers in the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau or the Internal Bureau (IB) branch in [[Dacca]], the capital of then East Pakistan. He entrusted the ISI with the responsibility for the collection of internal political intelligence in East Pakistan. Later on, during the Baloch nationalist revolt in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] in the mid 1970s, the ISI was tasked with performing a similar intelligence gathering operation.

The ISI lost its importance during the regime of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], who was very critical of its role during the 1970 general elections, which triggered off the events leading to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|partition of Pakistan]] and emergence of [[Bangladesh]].

The ISI regained its lost glory after Gen. [[Zia ul-Haq]] seized power in July 1977. Under his reign, the ISI was expanded by making it responsible for the collection of intelligence about the [[Sindh]] based [[Communist]] party and monitoring the [[Shia]] organization after the [[Iranian revolution]] of 1979, as well as monitoring various political parties such as the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP). During the [[Soviet-Afghan war]] of the 1980s saw the enhancement of the covert action capabilities of the ISI by the [[CIA]]. A special Afghan Section was created under the command of colonel [[Mohammed Yousaf]] to oversee the coordination of the war. A number of officers from the ISI's Covert Action Division received training in the US and many covert action experts of the CIA were attached to the ISI to guide it in its operations against the Soviet troops by using the Afghan [[Mujahideen]], specifically the fighters loyal to [[Ahmed Shah Masoud]].The United States of America provided technical assistance and financial support to Islamic fundamentalists of Pakistan and [[Arab]] volunteers through ISI.  

In 1988, Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq initiated [[Operation Tupac]] which was designation of a three part action plan for the liberation of Kashmir, initiated after the failure of [[Operation Gibraltar]]. The name of the operation came from [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru II]], the 18th century prince who led the war of liberation in [[Peru]] against Spanish rule. By May 1996, at least six major militant organizations, and several smaller ones, operated in Kashmir. Their forces are variously estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000 armed men and were mostly of Pakistani Punjabis and Pashtuns.They were roughly divided between those who support independence and those who support accession to Pakistan. The ISI is believed to have played a key role in masterminding the [[Kargil War]].

During 1998-1999 the ISI Director General was sidelined due to his relationship with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and General [[Muhammad Aziz Khan]] was in operation control and directly answerable only to General Pervez Musharraf. During this time the ISI was contributing greatly to the Taliban.

After the 9/11 attacks, Pakistan joined the American led Global War on Terror and turned against the Taliban. Some men in the ISI whose loyalty was suspect were removed and currently, the ISI have been heavily
engaged in [[counterterrorism]] against both [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] militants as well as tribal/sectarian terrorists in Pakistan.

==Objectives==
The objectives of ISI are:<ref>http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html</ref>

# Safeguard Pakistani interests and national security inside and outside the country.
# Monitor the political and military developments in adjoining countries, which have direct bearing on Pakistan's [[national security]] and in the formulation of its [[foreign policy]] and to collect foreign and domestic intelligence in such cases.
# Co-ordination of intelligence functions of the three military services.
# Keep vigilant surveillance over its cadre, foreigners, the media, politically active segments of Pakistani society, diplomats of other countries accredited to Pakistan and Pakistani diplomats serving outside the country.
# Interception and monitoring of communications.
# Conducting covert offensive and wartime operations.
# Security of Pakistan's nuclear program, and the security of top Pakistani army generals.

==Functions==
'''Collection of information:''' ISI obtains information critical to Indian strategic interests.  Both overt and covert means are adopted.

'''Classification of information:''' Data is sifted through, classified as appropriate, and filed with the assistance of the computer network in ISI's headquarters in Islamabad.

'''Aggressive intelligence:''' The primary mission of ISI includes aggressive intelligence which is comprised of [[espionage]], [[psychological warfare]], [[subversion (politics)|subversion]], [[sabotage]], and promoting [[insurgency]] in enemy locations.

'''Counter intelligence:''' ISI has a dedicated section which spies against enemy's intelligence collection oganizations. With unscrupulous enemy agencies abounding in Pakistani neighbourhood, this is among the most important function of ISI.

==Modus operandi==

}}
'''[[Diplomatic mission]]s:''' Diplomatic missions provide an ideal cover and ISI centers in a target country are generally located on the embassy premises.

'''[[multinational corporation|Multinationals]]:''' ISI operatives find good covers in multinational organizations. [[Non-governmental organization]]s and cultural programmes are also popular screens to shield ISI activities.

'''Media:''' International media centers can easily absorb ISI operatives and provide freedom of movement.

'''Collaboration with other agencies:''' ISI maintains active collaboration with other secret services in various countries.  Its contacts with Saudi Arabian Intelligence Services, Chinese Intelligence, [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] (when PLO weapons were transferred to Afghanistan via Pakistan), the [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] have been well-known.

'''Third Country Technique:''' ISI has been active in obtaining information and operating through third countries like [[Afghanistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and [[China]]. 

'''Spotting and Recruitment:''' ISI operatives actively search for local recruits and operatives. Separatist tendencies and ethnic or sectarian sensitivities are also allegedly used as grounds for manipulation (such as the alleged involvement of ISI with the [[Khalistan Commando Force]]). [[Armed force]]s and [[Paramilitary]] personnels remain a primary target for enrollment.

==Organizational structure==

ISI's headquarters are located in Islamabad and currently the head of the ISI is called the Director General who has to be a serving Lieutenant General in the Pakistan Army.  Under the Director General, three Deputy Director Generals report directly to him and are in charge in three separate fields of the ISI which are Political, External and General.  

The general staff of the ISI mainly come from police, Paramilitary Forces and some specialized units from the Pakistan Army such as the SSG commandos.  The total work force of the ISI has never been made public but experts estimate the size to be around 25,000. In addition to this ISI has over 30,000 informants and assets.<ref>http://www.politicsbharat.com/pakistan.php</ref>  

ISI is divided into several departments who are each tasked with various duties with the over all aim to safe guard Pakistan's interests.

===Departments===
*'''Joint Intelligence X''': JIX is the coordinator of all the other departments in the ISI.  Intelligence and information gathered from the other departments are sent to JIX which prepares and processes the information and from which prepares reports which are presented.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Intelligence Bureau''': JIB is the largest part of the ISI and was perhaps the most powerful component of the ISI in the late 1980s.  It's main area of work is to gather intelligence on political parties.  It also has three sub-sections which include operations in India, conducting anti-terrorism operations and providing security to VIPs.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Counter Intelligence Bureau''': JCIB is Pakistan's version of the NOC's of the CIA.  Pakistani diplomats who conduct intelligence gathering operations report directly to this department.  The area in which most of this kind of operations are conducted are in the Middle East, South Asia, China, Afghanistan and the Central Asian republics.  It is alleged that the ISI has expanded the range of the diplomats to conduct intelligence gathering operations in Europe, Africa and South America as well.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Intelligence North''': JIN is exclusively responsible for the Jammu and Kashmir region and in particular the Indian troop movement along the LOC (Line of Control).  However, due to recent peace overtures between India and Pakistan, the size of this department is being reduced.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Intelligence Miscellaneous''': JIM is responsible for conducting espionage, offensive spy missions, surveillance and any other activities during war time.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Signal Intelligence Bureau''': JSIB has three Deputy Directors who are each charged with wireless communication intercepts, Monitoring enemy agents and other assets and conducting reconnaissance operations such as photographs.  Most of the work force in this department are recruited from the Military College of Signals Academy and others come from the Army Signal Corps.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

*'''Joint Intelligence Technical''': JIT is responsible for developing gadgets, monitoring equipment, explosives and even has known to have a chemical warfare section.  Other than that, not much is known about this department.<ref name="ISI Departments">{{cite web| url=http://www.pakistanidefence.com/Info/Intelligence.html| title= Overview Of Intelligence Services| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=Pakistan | last=Defense}}</ref>

==Recruitment of ISI agents==
Both [[civilian]]s and members of the [[armed forces]] can join the ISI. 
However for civilians, recruitment is advertised and is jointly handled by the Federal Public Services Commission (FPSC) and civilian ISI agents are considered employees of the Ministry of Defense. The FPSC conducts various examinations testing the candidate's knowledge of current affairs, English and various analytical abilities. Based on the results, the candidates are shortlisted by FPSC and the shortlist is sent to the ISI which conducts the initial background checks. The selected candidates are then invited for an interview which is conducted by a committee comprising FPSC and ISI officials.

Those candidates who passed the interview then have to go through rigorous fitness, medical and psychological evaluations. Once the candidate clears these evaluations, the ISI performs a very thorough background check on the candidate before being offered to join the ISI. Security clearance is granted once the candidate accepts the offer. Recruited agents then go to the Inter-Services Intelligence School for basic training following which they are employed on an initial one year probationary period. However, civilian operatives are not allowed to rise above the equivalent of the rank of Major and are mostly assigned to JIX, JIB and JCIB departments and the rest of the departments are solely headed by the armed forces but there have been rare cases in which civilians have been assigned to those departments.

For the armed forces, officers have to apply for admission into the Inter-Services Intelligence School. After finishing the intelligence course, they can apply to be posted in Field Intelligence Units or in the directorate of Military/Air/Naval intelligence. Then they wait and hope that their performance is good enough to be invited to the ISI for a temporary posting. Based on their performance in the military and the temporary posting with ISI, they are then offered a more permanent position.

Senior ISI officers with ranks of Major and above are only assigned to the ISI for no more than 2-3 years to curtail the attempt to abuse their power. Almost all of the Director-Generals of the ISI have never served in the organization before being appointed by the Military commanders to lead it. ISI also monitors former, current and retired military officers who at one point or another held sensitive positions and had access to classified data.

==Training of ISI agents==
[[Image:Pak-army-commandos.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Pakistan's SSG Commandos. Many members of the ISI come from the SSG commandos and as such are well versed in the arts of warfare and combat.]]
Basic training commences with 'pep talks' to boost the morale of the new recruit using patriotism, religion and sense of honor and duty. In this early phase, the inductee is familiarized with the real world of intelligence and [[espionage]], as opposed to the spies of fiction.  Common usages, technical jargon and classification of information are taught. Case studies of other agencies like [[CIA]], [[KGB]], Chinese Secret Agency and [[Research and Analysis Wing|R&AW]] are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organizations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does.

After the initial phase, the recruit is send to the Inter-Services Intelligence School where training can last up to six months to a year. The recruit is given firsthand experience of what it was to be out in the figurative cold, conducting clandestine operations.  During night exercises under realistic conditions, he is taught [[infiltration]] and [[exfiltration]].  He is instructed to avoid capture and, if caught, how to face [[interrogation]].  He learns the art of reconnoiter, making contacts, and, the numerous skills of operating an intelligence mission.  At the end of the field training, the new recruit is brought back to the school for final polishing. Before his deployment in the field, he is given exhaustive training in the art of [[self-defense]], an introduction to [[martial arts]] and the use of technical espionage devices. He is also drilled in various administrative disciplines so that he could take his place in the foreign missions without arousing suspicion. He is now ready to operate under the cover of an Embassy to gather information, set up his own network of informers, [[mole (espionage)|mole]]s or operatives as the task may require.

*In the 1950s, the ISI's Covert Action Division was used in assisting the insurgents in India's North-East and its role was expanded in the late 1960s to assist the [[Sikh]] Home Rule Movement of London-based [[Charan Singh Panchi]], which was subsequently transformed into the [[Khalistan]] Movement, headed by [[Jagjit Singh Chauhan]] in which many other members of the Sikh diaspora in Europe, [[USA]] and [[Canada]] joined and then demanded the separate country of [[Khalistan]].  [[CIA]] and ISI worked in tandem during the [[Nixon]] Administration in assisting the [[Khalistan]] movement in Punjab.<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B| last=Raman}}</ref> 

*ISI decided to spy on the residence of Colonel Hussain Imam Mabruk who was a Military Attach<U+00E9> to the Embassy of [[Libya]] in [[Islamabad]] as he had made some inflammatory statements towards the military regime of Zia-ul-Haq. The spying paid off as he was seen talking with two Pakistani gentlemen who entered and left the compound suspiciously.  The ISI monitored the two men and were later identified as Pakistani exiles that hated the current military regime and were Bhutto loyalists. They had received terrorist training in Libya and were ready to embark on a terrorist campaign in Pakistan to force the Army to step down from power. All members of the conspiracy were apprehended before any damage could be done.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*ISI foiled an attempt by the French Ambassador to Pakistan, Le Gourrierce and his First Secretary, Jean Forlot who were on a surveillance mission to Kahuta nuclear complex on [[June 26]], [[1979]]. Both were intercepted and their cameras and other sensitive equipment were confiscated. Intercepted documents later on showed that the two were recruited by the CIA.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*After the failure of [[Operation Eagle Claw]], the U.S. media outlets such as Newsweek and Time reported that CIA agents stationed in Tehran had obtained information in regards to the location of the hostages, in-house information from a Pakistani cook who used to work for the U.S. Embassy. ISI successfully gathered evidence, and intercepted communication documents and showed it to the Iranian Chief of [[J-2]] which cleared the cook. The Iranian chief of intelligence said, <U+201C>We know, the Big Satan is a big liar.<U+201D><ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*ISI successfully intercepted two American private weapons dealers during the Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980<U+2019>s. One American diplomat (his name has not been de-classified) who lived in the F-7/4 sector of Islamabad was spotted by an ISI agent in a seedy part of Rawalpindi by his Car's diplomatic plates. He was bugged and trailed and was found to be in contact with various tribal groups supplying them with weapons for their fight with the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. Another was Eugene Clegg, a teacher in the American International School who also indulged in weapons trade. All of them were put out of business.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I. Tirmazi | title=Profiles of Intelligence | publisher=Combined Printers | year=1985 | id=Library of Congress Catalogue No. 95-930455}}</ref>

*ISI had placed a mole in the Soviet Embassy in Islamabad. The mole reported that the Third Secretary in the Soviet Embassy was after information in regards to the Karakurum Highway and was obtaining it from a middle level employee, Mr. Ejaz, of the [[Northern Areas Transport Corporation|Northern Motor Transport Company]]. ISI contacted Mr. Ejaz who then confessed that a few months ago the Soviet diplomat approached him and threatened his family unless he divulged sensitive information in regards to the highway such as alignment of the road, location of bridges, the number of Chinese personnel working on the Highway, etc. The ISI instead of confronting the Soviet diplomat chose to feed him with false information. This continued until the Soviet diplomat was satisfied that Mr. Ejaz had been bled white of all the information and then dropped him as a source.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I. Tirmazi | title=Profiles of Intelligence | publisher=Combined Printers | year=1985 | id=Library of Congress Catalogue No. 95-930455}}</ref>

*Worrying that among the large influx of Afghan refugees that come into Pakistan due to the Soviet-Afghan war were members of [[KHAD]] (Afghan Intelligence), the ISI successfully convinced Mansoor Ahmed who was the Charge-de-Affairs of the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad to turn his back on the Soviet backed Afghan government. He and his family were secretly escorted out of their residence and were given safe passage on a London bound British Airways flight in exchange for classified information in regards to Afghan agents in Pakistan. The Soviet and Afghan diplomats tried their best to find the family but were unsuccessful.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*A routine background checks on various staff members working for the Indian embassy raised suspicions on an Indian woman who worked as a school teacher in an Indian School in Islamabad. Her enthusiastic and too friendly attitude gave her up. She was in reality was an agent working for [[Research and Analysis Wing|RAW]]. ISI monitored her movements to a hotel in Islamabad where she rendezvoused with a local Pakistani man who worked as an engineer for Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. ISI then confronted her and were then able to turn her into a [[double agent]] spying on the Indian Embassy in Islamabad.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I. Tirmazi | title=Profiles of Intelligence | publisher=Combined Printers | year=1985 | id=Library of Congress Catalogue No. 95-930455}}</ref>

*ISI became aware of a plot to assassinate the President of Pakistan, Zia-ul-Haq and then launch a bloody coup to depose the current government and install an extreme Islamic government in its place. The attempted assassination and coup was to occur on [[March 23]], [[1980]] during the annual [[March 23]] Pakistan day parade. The masterminds behind the coup were high ranking Military and Intelligence officers and were led by Major General Tajammal Hussain Malik, his son, Captain Naveed and his nephew Major Riaz, a former Military Intelligence officer. ISI decided against arresting these men outright because they did not know how deep this conspiracy went and kept these men under strict surveillance. As the date of the annual parade approached, ISI was satisfied that it had identified the major players in this conspiracy and then arrested these men along with quite a few high ranking military officers.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A.

*Ilam Din also known as Ilmo was an infamous Indian spy working from Pakistan. He had eluded being captured many times but on [[March 23]] at 3 A.M., Ilmo and two other Indian spies were apprehended by Pakistani Rangers as they were illegally crossing into Pakistan from India. Their mission was to spy and report back on the new military equipment that Pakistan will be showing in their annual [[March 23]] Pakistan day parade. Ilmo after being thoroughly interrogated was then forced by the ISI to send false information to his RAW handlers in India. This process continued and many more Indian spies in Pakistan were flushed out such as Roop Lal.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*ISI uncovered a secret deal in which naval base facilities were granted by Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] to the [[USSR]] in Vizag and the Andaman & Nicobar Island and the alleged attachment of [[KGB]] advisers to the then Lieutenant General Sunderji who was the commander of [[Operation Bluestar]] in the Golden Temple in [[Amritsar]] in June 1984.<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B| last=Raman}}</ref>

*ISI, CIA and [[Mossad]] carried out a covert transfer of Soviet made [[PLO]] and Lebanese weapons captured by the Israelis during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982 and their subsequent transfer to Pakistan and then into [[Afghanistan]]. All knowledge of this weapon transfer was kept secret and was only made public recently.
[[Image:General Akhtar abdur rahman.jpg|px200|right|thumb|ISI Director, Akhtar Abdur Rahman who was the architect of the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union.]]
*ISI played a central role in the U.S.-backed guerrilla war to oust the Soviet Army from Afghanistan in the 1980s. That Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-backed effort flooded Pakistan with weapons and with Afghan, Pakistani and Arab "mujahideen", who were motivated to fight as a united force protecting fellow Muslims in Soviet occupied Afghanistan. The CIA relied on the ISI to train fighters, distribute arms, and channel money. The ISI trained about 83,000 Afghan mujahideen between 1983 and 1997, and dispatched them to Afghanistan.

*CIA through the ISI promoted the smuggling of heroin into Afghanistan in order to turn the Soviet troops into heroin addicts and thus greatly reducing their fighting potential.<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B| last=Raman}}</ref> (different material from the reference)

*Major General Sultan Habib who was an operative of the ISI's Joint Intelligence Miscellaneous department successfully procured nuclear material while being posted as the Defense Attach<U+00E9> in the Pakistani Embassy in [[Moscow]] from 1991 to 1993 and concurrently obtaining other materials from Central Asian Republics, [[Poland]] and the former [[Czechoslovakia]].  After Moscow, Major General Habib then coordinated shipping of missiles from [[North Korea]] and the training of Pakistani experts in the missile production.  These two acts greatly enhanced Pakistan's Nuclear weapons program and their missile delivery systems.<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B.| last=Raman}}</ref>

*ISI engineered the takeover of Afghanistan by the hard-line Islamic [[Taliban]] regime after the fall of the Communist government in Kabul in 1992.

*The ISI has been said to have tried to infiltrate the [[Indian Armed Forces]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6078212.stm| title=India launches intelligence probe| accessdate=2006-10-23}}</ref>

== Major failures of the ISI==
*The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war]] in Kashmir provoked a major crisis in intelligence. When the war started, there was a complete collapse of the operations of all the intelligence agencies, which had been largely devoted to domestic investigative work such as tapping telephone conversations and chasing political suspects. The covert infiltration plan, codenamed [[Operation Gibraltar]] was essentially an intelligence fiasco, partly due to ISI, after having overestimated so called "local support" to infiltrators in Kashmir and having underestimated the Indian response to the plan. The ISI, after the commencement of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, was apparently unable to locate an Indian armored division due to its preoccupation with political affairs. Ayub Khan set up a committee headed by General [[Yahya Khan]] to examine the working of the agencies.

*ISI failed to suppress the political parties in East Pakistan in the 1970s as well as stop Indian infiltration which led to the creation of Bangladesh.

*In 1981, a Libyan Security company called Al Murtaza Associates sends recruiters to Pakistan to entice former soldiers and servicemen for high paying security jobs in [[Libya]]. In reality, Libya was recruiting mercenaries to fight with [[Chad]] and [[Egypt]] as it had border disputes with both nations. Only later did the ISI become aware of the plot and the whole scheme was stopped, but nearly 2,700 Pakistanis had already left for those jobs.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A.

*The PAF Field Intelligence Unit at their base in [[Karachi]] in July 1980 captured an Indian agent. He was interrogated and revealed that a large network of Indian spies were functioning in Karachi. The agent claimed that these spies, in addition to espionage, had also assassinated a few armed personnel. He also said the leader of the spy ring was being headed by the food and beverages manager at the [[Intercontinental]] Hotel in Karachi and a number of serving Air Force officers and ratings were on his payroll. The ISI decided to survey the manager to see who he was in contact with, but then [[President of Pakistan]] Zia-ul Haq superseded and wanted the manager and anyone else involved in the case arrested immediately. It was later proven that the manager was completely innocent.<ref name="Profiles of Intelligence">{{cite book | author=Brigadier Syed A. I.

*ISI failed to perform a proper background check on the [[United Kingdom|British]] company which supplied the Pakistan Army with its [[Arctic]]-weather gear. When Pakistan attempted to secure the top of the [[Siachen Glacier]] in 1984, it placed a large order for Arctic-weather gear with the same company that also supplied the [[Indian Army]] with its gear. Indians were easily alerted to the large Pakistani purchase and deduced that this large purchase could be used to equip troops to capture the [[glacier]]. India then mounted an operation ([[Operation Meghdoot]]) and secured the top of the glacier before Pakistan.

*ISI failed to calculate the international reaction to the [[Kargil War|Kargil operation]] in summer of 1999. Subsequent heavy pressure by foreign countries such as [[USA]] forced the Pakistani-backed forces to withdraw from Kargil.

==Controversies==
Critics of the ISI say that it has become a state within a state, answerable neither to the leadership of the army, nor to the President or the Prime Minister.<ref name= "BBC News">{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1750265.stm | title= Profile: Pakistan's military intelligence agency | accessdate=2006-05-05| first=David| last= Chazan }}</ref> The ISI has been deeply involved in domestic politics of Pakistan since the late 1950s. The 1990 elections for example were widely believed to have been rigged by the ISI in favor of the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) party, a [[wiktionary:Conglomerate|conglomerate]] of nine mainly [[right-wing|rightist]] parties by the ISI under [[Lt. General Hameed Gul]], to ensure the defeat of Bhutto's [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP) in the polls.<ref name= "FAS">{{cite web| url= http://www.fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/isi/| title= Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI]| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=John| last= Pike }}</ref> Gul has denied that the vote was rigged. In September-October 1989, two ISI officers launched Operation Midnight Jackals in a bid to sway PPP members of the National Assembly to back a [[vote of no confidence]] against the Bhutto government. In early 1990's [[ISI]] became involved in politics of [[Karachi]], it launched operation against [[MQM]] seeing its growing popularity and political strength in the province of [[Sindh]]. It is alleged that [[ISI]] was involved in dividing [[MQM]]. This led to the creation of MQM-A and MQM-H, the former being the party of [[Altaf Hussain]] and latter Haqiqi group. MQM-Haqiqi group was made by [[ISI]] to target MQM-A and to stop its growing popularity. It even bribed several journalists and newspapers to agitate against MQM-A.<ref name= "Defence Journal">{{cite web| url= http://www.defencejournal.com/july98/civilmilitary2.htm | title= The Military and the Intelligence Agencies | accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref>
[[Image:Dawood ibrahim.jpg|thumb|150px|Indian Gangster [[Dawood Ibrahim]] whom India blames [[12 March]] [[1993]] Bombay Bombings|1993 Bombay bombings]]
ISI's Internal Political Division has been accused by various members of the Pakistan People's Party in assassinating [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], one of the two brothers of Benazir Bhutto, through poisoning in the [[French Riviera]] in the middle of 1985 in an attempt to intimidate her into not returning to Pakistan for directing the movement against Zia's Military government, but no proof has been found implicating the ISI.<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B| last=Raman}}</ref>

The ISI was also involved in a massive corruption scandal dubbed "Mehrangate", in which top ISI and Army brass were given large sums of money by Yunus Habib (the owner of Mehran Bank) to deposit ISI<U+2019>s foreign exchange reserves in Mehran Bank.<ref name="Ghazali">{{cite web| url= http://www.ghazali.net/book1/Chapter11a/body_page_4.html | title= ISLAMIC PAKISTAN: ILLUSIONS & REALITY | accessdate=2006-05-05| first= Abdus Sattar | last= Ghazali }}</ref> This was against government policy, as such banking which involves government institutions can only be done through state-owned financial institutions and not private banks. When the new director of the ISI was appointed and then proceeded to withdraw the money from Mehran Bank and back into state-owned financial institutions, the money had been used up in financing Habib's <U+201C>extra-curricular<U+201D> activities. On [[April 20]], [[1994]], Habib was arrested and the scandal became public.

India has blamed the ISI for training, arming and giving logistics to the militants who are fighting the Indian security forces in Indian occupied [[Kashmir]].<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group ">{{cite web| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/kashmir/Story/0,2763,722049,00.html| title= Dangerous game of state-sponsored terror that threatens nuclear conflict| accessdate=2006-05-05| first= Rory | last= McCarthy}}</ref> [[Federation of American Scientists|FAS]] reports that the Inter-Service Intelligence, is the main supplier of funds and arms to the militant groups.<ref name="FAS">{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/pakistan/isi/|title="Directorate for ISI" article on FAS, Intelligence Resource Program}}</ref> The British Government had stated there is a 'clear link' between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence and three major militant outfits<ref name="ISI">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/jun/11war4.htm |title=Information regarding links between ISI and militants}}</ref> [[The Guardian]] newspaper had uncovered evidence that Pakistani militants were openly raising funds and training new recruits and that the ISI's Kashmir cell was instrumental in funding and controlling these outfits.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/kashmir/Story/0,2763,722049,00.html |title=Dangerous game of state-sponsored terror...}} - [[The Guardian]]</ref>India also accused ISI of masterminding the 1993 Mumbai bombings, with backing from Dawood Ibrahim's [[D-Company]].<ref name="South Asia Analysis Group">{{cite web| url=http://www.saag.org/papers3/paper287.html| title=PAKISTAN'S INTER-SERVICES INTELLIGENCE (ISI)| accessdate=2006-05-05| first=B| last=Raman}}</ref> Aside from Kashmir, India accuses the ISI of running training camps near the border of [[Bangladesh]] in late 1990s where India claims the ISI trains members of various [[separatist]] groups from the northeastern Indian states. The ISI has denied these accusations.

In January 1993, the United States placed Pakistan on the watch list of such countries which were suspected of [[State sponsored terrorism|sponsoring international terrorism]]. This decision was made in part because the current head of the ISI in 1993, Lt. Gen. Nasir, had become a stumbling block in American efforts to buy back hundreds of shoulder-fired, [[surface-to-air]] [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles from the Afghan Mujahideen and was assisting organizations such as [[Harkat ul-Ansar]], which had been branded as a terrorist organization by the US. Once Nasir's tenure as ISI chief ended, the US removed Pakistan from the terrorism watch list. The ISI is also suspected to have been involved with the hijackers of the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]], having paid the ringleader [[Mohammad Atta]].<ref>[http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/CHO206A.html Centre for Research on Globalisation]</ref> After 9/11, ISI was purged of members who did not support President [[Pervez Musharraf]]'s stance towards the [[Taliban]] and [[Al Qaeda]].

In the [[BBC]] Newsnight Programme on [[27 September]] [[2006]], a research paper prepared for the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]], was quoted linking the ISI with support for the Taliban and other terrorist acts in the west.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5387168.stm Iraq war 'recruiting extremists'] - [[BBC]]</ref> The report states, "The US/UK cannot begin to turn the tide until they identify the real enemies from attacking ideas tactically - and seek to put in place a more just vision. This will require Pakistan to move away from Army rule and for the ISI to be dismantled and more significantly something to be put in its place."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/5388426.stm ISI linked with attacks in the West] - [[BBC]]</ref> This was denied by President Musharraf, "I totally, 200% reject it. I reject it from anybody - MoD or anyone who tells me to dismantle ISI."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5387344.stm Musharraf defends his spy service] - [[BBC]]</ref> The [[Council on Foreign Relations]], a [[United States|US]] [[foreign policy]] [[think tank]] published an article casting doubt on some of the accusations, 'Though Pakistan does offer safe haven to Kashmiri groups, and perhaps some Taliban fighters, the suggestion that the ISI is responsible for the 7/7 bombings of London<U+2019>s mass transit system is <U+201C>a real stretch,<U+201D> [Kathy] Gannon says'.<ref>[http://www.cfr.org/publication/11644/isi_and_terrorism.html The ISI and Terrorism: Behind the Accusations] - [[Council on Foreign Relations|CFR]]</ref> However, a later report by the same think tank, The Council on Foreign Relations, stated there was probably support for terrorism from rogue elements of the ISI [http://www.cfr.org/issue/135].

[[Image:AQ00107.jpg|thumb|150px|Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was one of the biggest Al Qaeda terrorists captured by the ISI.]]
[[Amnesty International]] publish a report on [[29 September]] [[2006]] accusing Pakistan of detaining hundreds of alleged terror suspects without legal process. The group says some were tortured or otherwise ill-treated, others were sold to the US military, and others have vanished without trace. "Journalists and human rights activists have told Amnesty International that most terror suspects deemed important by Pakistani intelligence were held in "safe houses" run by "the agencies" <U+2013> Pakistan<U+2019>s intelligence agencies including the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Military Intelligence (MI)."<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA330352006 Pakistan - Human rights ignored in the <U+2018>war on terror<U+2019>] - [[Amnesty International]]</ref> 'In many cases, U.S. agents paid a bounty of $5,000 (2,667 UK pounds) to those, usually intelligence agents, who simply declared people terrorists, seized them and handed them over for interrogation with no legal process, Amnesty said. "Enforced disappearances were almost unheard of in Pakistan before the start of the U.S-led war on terror -- now they are a growing phenomenon, spreading beyond terror suspects", Amnesty researcher Angelika Pathak said.'<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/29092006/325/pakistan-accused-terror-abductions.html Pakistan accused of terror abductions]- [[Reuters]]</ref> Gen Musharraf strongly denied the allegations that some alleged terror suspects had vanished without trace, "I don't want even to reply to that, it is a nonsense, I don't believe it, I don't trust it".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5394278.stm West 'will fail' without Pakistan] - [[BBC]]</ref> 'Gen Musharraf has boasted of the arrests as proof of his commitment to the fight against al-Qaida.

Some members of the American media and political establishment have questioned Pakistan's commitment in combating the Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants in border areas. In response, Pakistan has pointed to the deployment of nearly 80,000 troops in the border areas and the arrests of more than 700 Al Qaeda members carried out by mostly ISI members, the most high profile ones including 9/11 mastermind [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], as proof that the ISI was serious in its commitment to fighting the [[War on Terrorism]].<ref name="BBC ">{{cite web| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2812181.stm| title= Al-Qaeda suspect 'under interrogation'| accessdate=2006-05-05}}</ref> However, the recent [[Waziristan Accord|deal with the rebels]] to end the [[Waziristan War]] has been seen by many observers as a defeat for Pakistan,<ref>A battle lost By Tony Blankley [[The Washington Times]] [[September 27]], [[2006]]</ref> that has strengthened Taliban powerbase in [[Waziristan]].<ref>[http://inbrief.threatswatch.org/2006/09/pakistan-cedes-north-wazirista/ Pakistan Cedes North Waziristan to Taliban] - Threats Watch</ref> Moreover, [[NATO]]'s top commanders have criticized ISI's continued role in supplying weapons and providing sanctuary to the terrorists<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/10/06/wafghan06.xml  Nato's top brass accuse Pakistan over Taliban aid] - [[The Daily Telegraph]], 06/10/2006 </ref> but have approved the deal.<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061011/wl_sthasia_afp/pakistanafghanistan_061011193221 NATO wants to copy Pakistan's militant peace deal]</ref>

==Media Portrayal==
[[Image:Ek1.jpg|thumb|right|The film ''Ek'' revolves around a R&AW agent, an [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] agent, and a [[CIA]] agent who don<U+2019>t trust each other. The film is about how they learn to work together towards to stop a disaster from happening.]]
The ISI has rarely been portrayed on the silver screen and on Television by the Pakistani Media as they are shy to explore such a sensitive institution of Pakistan. 

However foreign media such as [[Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]] are now starting to portray ISI in movies and television programming given the current nature on the fight with global terrorism and Pakistan being the forefront of this fight.

Some of the Media Portrayal of ISI are:
*''Ek'', a Hindi movie in which [[CIA]], ISI and [[R&AW]] agents work together to stop terrorists from detonating a [[nuclear weapon]] in [[Mumbai]].
*''[[Charlie Wilson's War]]'', a Hollywood movie which shows how USA armed and trained the Afghan [[Mujahideen]] with the help of Pakistan's ISI.
*''[[Path to 9/11]]'', an [[American television]] [[mini-series]] which shows how events lead up to [[9/11]] and highlights the ISI's assistance in capturing the terrorist [[Ramzi Yousef]].
*''[[Black Friday]]'', a [[Bollywood movie]] which cronicles the events the [[1993 Mumbai bombings]] and the ISI's role in instigating and supporting the chain of events.
*''Qayamat'', a Hindi movie showing [[ISI]] helping terrorists in India to bomb lakes and rivers in [[Mumbai]] with poisonous substance.
