The '''Confederate government of Kentucky''' was a [[shadow government]] established for the [[Commonwealth (United States)|Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]] by a self-constituted group of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers during the [[American Civil War]]. The shadow government never replaced the elected government in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]], which had strong [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sympathies. Neither was it able to gain the whole support of Kentucky's citizens; its jurisdiction extended only as far as Confederate battle lines in the Commonwealth. Nevertheless, the provisional government was recognized by the Confederate States of America, and Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861. Kentucky was represented by the central star on the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Battle Flag|Confederate battle flag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngeorgia.com/history/flagsofga.html |title=A Concise History of the Flags of the Confederate States of America and the Sovereign State of Georgia |accessdate=2006-11-29 |last=Irby, Jr. |first=Richard E. |work=About North Georgia |publisher=Golden Ink}}</ref>

[[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] was designated the Confederate capital of Kentucky. Due to the military situation in the state, the provisional government was exiled and traveled with the [[Army of Tennessee]] for most of its existence. For a short time in the autumn of 1862, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General [[Braxton Bragg]] attempted to install the provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]] ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved at the end of the war.

The provisional government elected two governors. [[George W. Johnson (governor)|George W. Johnson]] was elected at the Russellville Convention and served until his death at the [[Battle of Shiloh]]. [[Richard Hawes]] was elected to replace Johnson and served through the remainder of the war.

==Background==
Kentucky's citizens were split regarding the issues central to the Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with [[Ohio River]] cities such as [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] while at the same time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] was within the Union. 

The [[United States presidential election, 1860|presidential election of 1860]] showed Kentucky's mixed sentiments when the state gave [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] 45% of the popular vote, [[John C. Breckinridge]] 36%, [[Stephen Douglas]] 18%, and [[Abraham Lincoln]] less than 1%. Historian Allan Nevins interpreted the election results to mean that Kentuckians strongly opposed both [[Ordinance of Secession|secession]] and coercion against the secessionists. The majority coalition of Bell and Douglas supporters was seen as a solid moderate Unionist position that opposed precipitate action by extremists on either side.<ref name=nevins>Nevins, pp. 129&ndash;130</ref>

[[Image:John C Breckinridge-04775-restored.jpg|thumb|right|<center>1860 Presidential candidate John Breckinridge represented the [[states' rights]] position.]]
The majority of Kentucky's citizens believed the state should be a mediator between the North and South. On December 9, 1860, [[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky Governor]] [[Beriah Magoffin]] sent a letter to the other slave state governors, suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a division of common territories at the 37th parallel, a guarantee of free use of the [[Mississippi River]], and a Southern [[veto]] over slave legislation. Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure the concessions. Because of the escalating pace of events, neither conference was held.<ref name=cwky67>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', pp. 6&ndash;7</ref>

Governor Magoffin called a special session of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] on December 27, 1860, to ask the legislators for a convention to decide the Commonwealth's course in the sectional conflict.<ref name=cwky7>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 7</ref> The ''Louisville Morning Courier'' on January 25, 1861 articulated the position that the secessionists faced in the legislature, "Too much time has already been wasted. The historic moment once past, never returns. For us and for Kentucky, the time to act is NOW OR NEVER."<ref>Shortridge, p. 290</ref> The Unionists, on the other hand, were unwilling to surrender the fate of the state to a convention that might "in a moment of excitement, adopt the extreme remedy of secession."<ref>Heck, p. 333</ref> The Unionist position carried after many of the states rights' legislators, opposing the idea of immediate secession, voted against the convention.<ref>Shortridge, pp. 290&ndash;291</ref> The assembly did, however, send six delegates to a February 4 [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the [[Crittenden Compromise]], proposed by Kentuckian [[John J. Crittenden]].<ref name=cwky8>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 8</ref>

As a result of the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], President Lincoln sent a [[telegram]] to Governor Magoffin requesting that the Commonwealth supply four regiments as its share of the overall request of 75,000 troops for the war.<ref name=harrison>Harrison in ''Kentucky Governors'', pp. 82&ndash;84</ref> Magoffin, a Confederate sympathizer, replied, "President Lincoln, [[Washington, D.C.]] I will send not a man nor a dollar for the wicked purpose of subduing my sister [[Southern United States|Southern states]]. B. Magoffin"<ref name=powell52>Powell, p. 52</ref> Both houses of the General Assembly met on May 7 and passed [[Kentucky Declaration of Neutrality|declarations of neutrality]] in the war, a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20.<ref name=cwky9>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 9</ref>

In a special congressional election held June 20, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats.<ref name=rose>Rose, pp. 63&ndash;65</ref> Confederate sympathizers won only the [[Jackson Purchase]] region,<ref name=rose /> which was economically linked to Tennessee by the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]]s.<ref name=kleber193>Kleber, p. 193</ref> Believing defeat at the polls was certain, many Southern Rightists had [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]; of the 125,000 votes cast, Unionists captured close to 90,000.<ref name=cwky11>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 11</ref> Confederate sympathizers were dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in [[veto]]-proof Unionist majorities of 76&ndash;24 in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House]] and 27&ndash;11 in the [[Kentucky Senate|Senate]].<ref name=rose /> From then on, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.<ref name=rose />

Historian Wilson Porter Shortridge made the following analysis: 
{{cquote|These elections demonstrated that a majority of the people of Kentucky were opposed to secession, but they could not be interpreted as an approval of the war policy of the Lincoln administration, as was quite generally done at the north at that time. Perhaps the best explanation at that time was that the people of Kentucky desired peace and thought that the election of the union candidates was the best way to get it.<ref>Shortridge, p. 297</ref>}}

With secession no longer considered a viable option, the pro-Confederate forces became the strongest supporters for neutrality. Unionists dismissed this as a front for a secessionist agenda. Unionists, on the other hand, struggled to find a way to move the large, moderate middle to a <U+201C>definite and unqualified stand with the Washington government.<U+201D> The maneuvering between the two reached a decisive point on September 3 when Confederate forces were ordered from Tennessee to the Kentucky towns of [[Hickman, Kentucky|Hickman]] and [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]]. Union forces responded by occupying [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]].<ref>Shortridge, pp. 298&ndash;300</ref>

On September 11, the legislature passed a resolution instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor vetoed the resolution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested the assistance of the Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request. Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.<ref>Shortridge, p. 300</ref>

==Formation==
{{Wikisource|Confederate Constitution of Kentucky}}
A pro-Confederate peace meeting, with Breckinridge as a speaker, was scheduled for September 21. Unionists feared the meeting would lead to actual military resistance, and dispatched troops from [[Camp Dick Robinson]] to disband the meeting and arrest Breckinridge.<ref>Heck, p. 343</ref> Breckinridge, as well as many other state leaders identified with the secessionists, fled the state. These leaders eventually served as the nucleus for a group that would create a shadow government for Kentucky. In his October 8 "Address to the People of Kentucky," Breckinridge declared, "The [[United States]] no longer exists. The Union is dissolved."<ref>Brown, p. 80</ref>

On October 29, 1861, 63 delegates representing 34 [[List of counties in Kentucky|counties]] met at [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] to discuss the formation of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth.<ref name=brown83>Brown, p. 83</ref> Despite its defeats at the polls, this group believed that the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky's citizens.<ref name=harrison /> [[Trigg County, Kentucky|Trigg County]]'s [[Henry Cornelius Burnett|Henry Burnett]] was elected chairman of the proceedings.<ref name=brown83 /> [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] farmer George W. Johnson chaired the committee that wrote the convention's final report and introduced some of its key resolutions.<ref name=harrison /> The report called for a sovereignty convention to sever ties with the Federal government.<ref name=harrison /> Both Breckinridge and Johnson served on the Committee of Ten that arranged the convention.<ref name=brown83 />

The first item was ratification of an [[ordinance of secession]], which proceeded in short order.<ref name=register13 /> Next, being unable to flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that "the [[Kentucky Constitution|Constitution]] and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, and the establishment of this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state."<ref name=register14>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 14</ref> The delegates proposed a provisional government to consist of a legislative council of ten members (one from each Kentucky congressional district); a governor, who had the power to appoint judicial and other officials; a treasurer and an auditor.<ref name=brown84>Brown, p. 84</ref> The delegates designated Bowling Green (then under the control of Confederate general [[Albert Sidney Johnston]]) as the Confederate State capital, but had the foresight to provide for the government to meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the council and governor.<ref name=register14 /> The convention adopted a new [[Seals of the U.S. states|state seal]], an arm wearing [[mail (armour)|mail]] with a star, extended from a circle of twelve other stars.<ref name=kye-gov />

The convention unanimously elected Johnson as governor.<ref name=kye-gov /> [[Horatio F. Simrall]] was elected [[lieutenant governor]] but soon fled to [[Mississippi]] to escape Federal authorities.<ref name=powell116>Powell, p. 116</ref> Robert McKee, who had served as secretary of both conventions, was appointed secretary of state.<ref name=brown85>Brown, p. 85</ref> [[Theodore Legrand Burnett]] was elected treasurer but resigned on December 17 to accept a position in the [[Confederate Congress]].<ref name=brown85 /> He was replaced by [[Warren County, Kentucky|Warren County]] native John Quincy Burnham.<ref name=brown85 /> The position of auditor was first offered to former Congressman [[Richard Hawes]], but Hawes declined to continue his military service under [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]].<ref name=kye-hawes>Kleber, pp. 418&ndash;419</ref> In his stead, the convention elected Josiah Pillsbury, also of Warren County.<ref name=brown85 /> The legislative council elected [[Willis Benson Machen]] as its president.<ref name=brown85 />

On November 21, the day following the convention, Johnson wrote Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]] to request Kentucky's admission to the Confederacy.<ref name=rose /> Burnett, [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]], and [[William E. Simms]] were chosen as the state's commissioners to the Confederacy.<ref name=register15>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 15</ref> For reasons unexplained by the delegates, Dr. [[Luke P. Blackburn]], a native Kentuckian living in [[Mississippi]], was invited to accompany the commissioners to [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name=brown85 /> Though Davis had reservations about circumvention of the elected [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] in forming the Confederate government, he concluded that Johnson's request had merit, and on November 25, recommended Kentucky for admission to the Confederacy.<ref name=brown87>Brown, p. 87</ref> Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861.<ref name=harrison />

==Activity==
On November 26, 1861, Governor Johnson issued an address to the citizens of the Commonwealth blaming [[abolitionism|abolitionist]]s for the breakup of the United States.<ref name=rose /> He asserted his belief that the Union and Confederacy were forces of equal strength, and that the only solution to the war was a free trade agreement between the two sovereign nations.<ref name=rose /> He further announced his willingness to resign as provisional governor if the Kentucky General Assembly would agree to cooperate with Governor Magoffin.<ref name=rose /> Magoffin himself denounced the Russellville Convention and the provisional government, stressing the need to abide by the will of the majority of the Commonwealth's citizens.<ref name=register16>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 16</ref>

[[Image:Gwjohnson ky.jpg|thumb|left|<center>[[George W. Johnson (Civil War)|George W. Johnson]], the first Confederate governor of Kentucky]]
During the winter of 1861, Johnson tried to assert the legitimacy of the fledgling government but its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army.<ref name=rose /> Johnson came short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress.<ref name=rose /> Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful.<ref name=rose /> On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3 million (${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|3000000|1862|r=-6}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses.<ref name=register20>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 20</ref> The Congress instead approved a sum of $2 million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War [[Judah P. Benjamin]] and President Davis.<ref name=register20 /> Much of the provisional government's operating capital was probably provided by Kentucky congressman [[Eli Metcalfe Bruce]], who made a fortune from varied economic activities throughout the war.<ref name=register20 />

The council met on December 14 to appoint representatives to the Confederacy's [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] provisional congress.<ref name=brown88>Brown, p. 88</ref> Those appointed would serve for only two months, as the provisional congress was replaced with a permanent [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature on February 17, 1862.<ref name=brown88 /> Kentucky was entitled to two senators and 12 representatives in the permanent Confederate Congress.<ref name=register22>Harrison in ''Register'', p. 22</ref> The usual day for general elections being passed, Governor Johnson and the legislative council set election day for Confederate Kentucky on January 22.<ref name=register22 /> Voters were allowed to vote in whichever county they occupied on election day, and could cast a general ballot for all positions.<ref name=register22 /> In an election that saw military votes outnumber civilian ones, only four of the provisional legislators were elected to seats in the Confederate House of Representatives.<ref name=register22 /> One provisional legislator, Henry Burnett, was elected to the Confederate Senate.<ref name=register22 />

The provisional government took other minor actions during the winter of 1861. An act was passed to rename [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Wayne County]] to Zollicoffer County in honor of [[Felix Zollicoffer]], who died at the [[Battle of Mill Springs]].<ref name=brown89>Brown, p. 89</ref> Local officials were appointed in areas controlled by Confederate forces, including many [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]].<ref name=rose /> When the Confederate government eventually disbanded, the legality of marriages performed by these justices was questioned, but eventually upheld.<ref name=rose />

===Withdrawal from Kentucky and death of Governor Johnson===
Following [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Fort Henry]], General Johnston withdrew from Bowling Green into [[Tennessee]] on February 7, 1862. A week later, Governor Johnson and the provisional government followed. On March 12, the ''[[The Times-Picayune|New Orleans Picayune]]'' reported that "the capital of Kentucky [is] now being located in a Sibley tent."<ref name=rose />

Governor Johnson, despite his presumptive official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm,<ref name=kye-johnson>Kleber, p. 473</ref> volunteered to serve under General [[John C. Breckinridge]] and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the [[Battle of Shiloh]].<ref name=harrison /> On April 7, Johnson was severely wounded in the thigh and abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson was recognized by acquaintance and fellow [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], [[Alexander McDowell McCook]], a Union general.<ref name=harrison /> Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship ''Hannibal'',<ref name=rose /> and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.

===Richard Hawes as governor===
[[Image:Richard-Hawes.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Richard Hawes]], the second Confederate governor of Kentucky]]
Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson requested that Richard Hawes come to the city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with [[typhoid fever]].<ref name=rose-hawes>Rose, pp. 90&ndash;91</ref> Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor.<ref name=harrison-hawes>Harrison in ''Kentucky Governors'', pp. 85&ndash;88</ref> Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in [[Corinth, Mississippi]], and took the oath of office on May 31.<ref name=brown93>Brown, p. 93</ref>

During the summer of 1862, word began to spread through the Army of Tennessee that Generals Bragg and [[Edmund Kirby Smith]] were planning an invasion of Kentucky.<ref name=brown93 /> The legislative council voted to endorse the invasion plan, and on August 27, Governor Hawes was dispatched to Richmond to favorably recommend it to President Davis.<ref name=harrison /> Davis was non-committal, but Bragg and Smith proceeded, nonetheless.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> 

On August 30, Smith commanded one of the most complete Confederate victories of the war against an inexperienced Union force at the [[Battle of Richmond]].<ref name=kleber-bor>Kleber, pp. 772&ndash;773</ref> Bragg also won a decisive victory at the September 13 [[Battle of Munfordville]], but the delay there cost him the larger prize of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], which Don Carlos Buell moved to occupy on September 25.<ref name=cwky46>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 46</ref> Having lost Louisville, Bragg spread his troops into defensive postures in the central Kentucky cities of [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Shelbyville, Kentucky|Shelbyville]] and [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] and waited for something to happen, a move that historian Kenneth Noe called a "stupendously illogical decision."<ref name=cwky48>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 48</ref><ref name=noe>Noe, p. 124</ref>

Meanwhile, the leaders of Kentucky's Confederate government had remained in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], awaiting Governor Hawes' return.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> They finally departed on September 18,<ref name=harrison-hawes /> and caught up with Bragg and Smith in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] on October 2.<ref name="rose-hawes" /> Bragg had been disappointed with the number of soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued.<ref name=cwky47>Harrison in ''The Civil War in Kentucky'', p. 47</ref><ref name=ea407>''Encyclopedia Americana'', p. 407</ref> Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently-captured state capital of [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]].<ref name="rose-hawes" /> On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council.<ref name=powell115 /> In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.<ref name=ea407 /><ref name=powell115>Powell, p. 115</ref><ref name=ea707>''Encyclopedia Americana, p. 707</ref>

==Decline and dissolution==
Following the [[Battle of Perryville]], the provisional government left Kentucky for the final time.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> Displaced from their home state, members of the legislative council dispersed to places where they could make a living or be supported by relatives until Governor Hawes called them into session.<ref name=brown96>Brown, p. 96</ref> Scant records show that on December 30, 1862, Hawes summoned the council, auditor, and treasurer to his location at [[Athens, Tennessee]] for a meeting on January 15, 1863.<ref name=brown96 /> Hawes himself unsuccessfully lobbied President Davis to remove Hawes' former superior, Humphrey Marshall, from command.<ref>Brown, pp. 96&ndash;97</ref> On March 4, Hawes told Davis by letter that "our cause is steadily on the increase" and assured him that another foray into the Commonwealth would produce better results than the first had.<ref name=brown97>Brown, p. 97</ref>

The government's financial woes also continued. Hawes was embarrassed to admit that neither he nor anyone else seemed to know what became of approximately $45,000 that had been sent from [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] during the Confederate occupation of Kentucky.<ref name=brown97 /> Another major blow was Davis' 1864 decision not to allow Hawes to spend $1 million that had been secretly appropriated in August 1861 to help Kentucky maintain its neutrality.<ref name=harrison-hawes /> Davis reasoned that the money could not be spent for its intended purpose, since Kentucky had already been admitted to the Confederacy.<ref name=harrison-hawes />

Late in the war, the provisional government existed mostly on paper. However, in the summer of 1864, Colonel R. A. Alston of the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry requested Governor Hawes' assistance in investigating crimes allegedly committed by Brigadier General [[John Hunt Morgan]] during his latest raid into Kentucky. Hawes never had to act on the request, however, as Morgan was suspended from command on August 10 and killed by Union troops on September 4, 1864.<ref name="rose-hawes" />

There is no documentation detailing exactly when Kentucky's provisional government ceased operation. It is assumed to have dissolved upon the conclusion of the Civil War.<ref name="rose-hawes" />
