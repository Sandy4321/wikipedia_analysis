'''Flossie Wong-Staal''' (<U+9EC3><U+4EE5><U+975C> [[pinyin]]: Hu<U+00E1>ng Y<U+01D0> j<U+00EC>ng, born August 27, 1947), born Yee Ching Wong, is a Chinese-American [[virologist]] and  [[molecular biologist]]. She was the first scientist to clone [[HIV]] and determine the function of its genes, a major step in proving that HIV is the cause of [[AIDS]]. From 1990 to 2002, she held the Florence Riford Chair in AIDS Research at the [[University of California at San Diego]] (UCSD).  She was co-founder and, after retiring from UCSD, Chief Scientific Officer of [[Immusol]], which was renamed iTherX Pharmaceuticals in 2007 when it transitioned to a drug development company focused on [[hepatitis C]], and where she remains Chief Scientific Officer.<ref name="PRN">{{cite news | title = Immusol Chief Scientific Officer, Flossie Wong-Staal, Ph.D., Named One of Top 50 Women Scientists | publisher = PR Newswire | date = October 15, 2002}}</ref>

==Professional career==
In 1972, following the receipt of her PhD, Wong-Staal undertook postdoctoral research at UCSD.  Her postdoctoral work continued under 1974, when she left to work for [[Robert Gallo]] at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI).  At the institute, Wong-Staal began her research into [[retroviruses]].<ref name="NAA">{{cite book | title = Notable Asian Americans | publisher = Gale Research | year = 1995}}</ref>

In 1983, Wong-Staal, Gallo and her team of NCI scientists identified HIV as the cause of [[AIDS]], simultaneously with [[Luc Montagnier]].  Two years later, Wong-Staal cloned HIV and then completed genetic mapping of the virus.  The genetic mapping made it possible to develop HIV tests.<ref name="WOH">{{cite book | title = World of Health | publisher = Gale Group | year = 2000}}</ref> 

In 1990, Wong-Staal moved from NCI to UCSD. Wong-Staal continued her research into HIV and AIDS at UCSD. In 1994 she was named as chairman of UCSD's newly created Center for AIDS Research.<ref name="WOMI">{{cite book | title = World of Microbiology and Immunology | publisher = Gale | year = 2003}}</ref> In that same year, Wong-Staal was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academies.

In the 1990s, Wong-Staal's research focused on [[gene therapy]], using a [[ribozyme]] "molecular knife" to repress HIV in [[stem cells]].  The protocol she developed was the second to be funded by the United States government.  

In 2002, Wong-Staal retired from UCSD and now holds the title of Professor Emerita. She then joined Immusol, a [[biopharmaceutical]] company that she co-founded while she was at UCSD, as Chief Scientific Officer. Recognizing the need for improved drugs for hepatitis C (HCV), she transitioned Immusol to an HCV therapeutics focus and renamed it iTherX Pharmaceuticals to reflect this.  That same year, [[Discover Magazine|Discover]] named Wong-Staal one of the fifty most extraordinary women scientists.<ref name="PRN"/>  Wong-Staal remains as a Research Professor of Medicine at UCSD.<ref>[http://www.immusol.com/company.php?id=2 Immusol. <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In 2007, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' heralded Dr. Wong-Staal  as #32 of the "Top 100 Living Geniuses."<ref>{{cite news|Robert Simon Jr. url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1567544/Top-100-living-geniuses.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Top 100 living geniuses | date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>
