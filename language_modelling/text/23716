{{Nihongo|'''''Strawberry Panic!'''''|<U+30B9><U+30C8><U+30ED><U+30D9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30FB><U+30D1><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>!|Sutorober<U+012B> Panikku!}} is the title of illustrated [[Japan]]ese fictional short stories and related media works written by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] author [[Sakurako Kimino]] which focus on a group of [[Adolescence|teenage girls]] attending three affiliated all-girl schools atop Astrea Hill. A common theme throughout the stories is the [[Intimate relationship|intimate]] [[lesbian]] relationships between the characters. The original artist was [[Chitose Maki]] who was succeeded by [[Namuchi Takumi]] when production of the [[manga]] and [[light novel]]s began.

When ''Strawberry Panic!'' first ran in ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', it took six months into the process before results started to appear that the series was a success and that fans of the series were growing in number. The manga and light novels that followed were the effect of this popularity.  The series became popular enough that [[Los Angeles]]-based company [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the manga series and light novels for [[English language]] distribution. ''Strawberry Panic!'' is one of the debut titles on the company's Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) production lines.

There is a slight difference in the title of the series between media and national affiliation. The original short stories, manga, light novels, and video game used the [[exclamation mark]] in the title; the anime excluded it. When the manga and light novel series were licensed for [[English language]] distribution, [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] did not use the exclamation mark in the title. The appearance of the logo for ''Strawberry Panic!'' has changed four times. The subtitle "Girls' School in Fullbloom" was added during the short stories stage which later appeared on the video game version, but was excluded from other adaptations including the manga, light novels, and anime.

==History==
''Strawberry Panic!'' began as a collection of thirty short stories serialized in the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[bish<U+014D>jo]] magazine ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'', published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. The first three short stories were printed in the February 2004 issue of the magazine.<ref name="Feb04">{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2004|pages=135|accessdate=2007-03-07|language=Japanese}}</ref> Following the printing of the short stories, a [[manga]] adaptation began on [[September 30]] [[2005]], serialized in the same magazine as with the short stories. A [[light novel]] series started production on MediaWorks' ''[[Dengeki Bunko]]'' publishing label; the first volume was released on [[March 10]] [[2006]]. Unlike the manga, the light novels were never serialized in a magazine before being printed in bound volumes. An anime retelling first aired on [[April 3]] [[2006]] in Japan, produced by the Japanese animation studio, [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]. Three [[drama CD]]s based on the anime version were released in Japan, the first on [[July 26]] [[2006]]. A [[PlayStation 2]] video game, published by the same company as the manga and novel, was released in Japan on [[August 24]] [[2006]].

The manga, as of 2007, continues to be released in Japan while the short stories have been discontinued. The anime series ended on [[September 25]] [[2006]], containing twenty-six episodes, and the last light novel was released on [[December 10]] [[2006]].

==Plot==
The plot of ''Strawberry Panic!'' is about the lives of [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls who each attend one of three affiliated all-girl [[Strawberry Panic!#Schools|schools]] which share a campus and dormitories, which include: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute and St. Lulim's Girls' School. Students who reside on campus live in dormitories that are referred to as the ''[[Strawberry Panic!#Strawberry Dorms|Strawberry Dorms]]'', though the proper name is ''[[Astrea]] Dormitory'', named after Astrea Hill where the institutions are located.<ref name="ANN">{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6176|title=Strawberry Panic! (TV)|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref>

The main heroine of the story is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her [[Strawberry Panic!#Schools|fourth year]] at St. Miator after being transferred from a different school. Upon first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to figure out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student by the name of Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astrea Hill's [[Strawberry Panic!#Etoile system|Etoile]], a very important person who acts as a representative among the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill.<ref name="ANN"/> Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty and finds that she cannot move. After Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. Next to her bed is a different girl the same age as Nagisa named Tamao Suzumi who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.

In the story that follows, Nagisa is introduced to other students from each of the three schools, those of which include students she admires, is intimidated by, or are merely friends that she meets while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the [[Intimate relationship|relationships]] the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating.<ref name="ANN"/>

==Themes==
The central theme in ''Strawberry Panic!'' is the [[lesbian]]ism related to the relationships between the girls from the three schools. Depending on the media type, the way the relationships between the girls is presented varies, such as there being more explicit [[fan service]], or appealing visuals including the girls in provocative situations, in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. Such fan service includes graphical representations or the lesbian acts, such as light nudity and hard groping. There is a wide range of [[intimate relationship]]s presented in the series and depending on the media type, a given character may not be shown to be in a direct relationship; such examples in the anime include Chikaru Minamoto and Shion T<U+014D>mori. These relationships range from simple conversations and meetings, escalating to minor make out sessions and having [[sexual intercourse]] in the extreme cases.<ref name="anime26"/>

Another theme that appears throughout the story is a focus on [[Astronomical object|astronomical]] [[star]]s. The main [[plot device]] is the [[#Etoile system|Etoile election]]; ''Etoile'' is a [[French language|French]] word meaning ''star''.  The three schools are atop Astrea Hill; ''[[Astraea (mythology)|Astrea]]'' means ''star-maiden'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] and is a figure in [[Greek mythology]] who later became the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. [[Spica]] is actually a star in the same constellation and each of the school emblems have stars in them. [[Catholic]] religion undertones are present in the series, including a [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|St. Mary]] statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astrea Hill.

{{main|List of Strawberry Panic! characters}}
At each of the three schools, there are four main characters whom were the original twelve characters created for the short stories when the series began. Only these twelve appear in the later adapted visual novel version.<ref name="MWcharacterpage">{{citeweb||url=http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/users_s/gs/strawberry/game/character.php|title=Characters of Strawberry Panic!|publisher=MediaWorks|accessdate=2006-06-29|language=Japanese}}</ref> Other characters were later introduced in the manga and light novel versions in order to create plotlines and conflict.

;St. Miator's Girls' Academy
Nagisa Aoi is the main character of the story and the main love interest for the other three main characters attending Miator who each have crushes on her.<ref name="Nagisa">{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenfo.com/anime/character/display.php?id=7854&n=fzpjpe&t=aoi_nagisa|title=Nagisa Aoi's bio at Animenfo.com|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> She is a cheerful girl who finds enjoyment in making new friends which she can easily do due to her free personality and sociable attitude in life. The first person she meets at Miator is Shizuma Hanazono, a mysterious upperclassman who is the current Etoile.<ref name="Shizuma">{{citeweb|url=http://www.animenfo.com/anime/character/display.php?id=7855&n=isennj&t=hanazono_shizum|title=Shizuma Hanazono's bio at Animenfo.com|accessdate=2006-06-30}}</ref> Nagisa at first finds that she is strangly affected when in the presence of Shizuma. The next girl she meets is Tamao Suzumi, who becomes Nagisa's close friend and roommate.<ref name="Nagisa"/> Tamao is well-regarded among her fellow Miator students; among the first-years, she is seen as a viable Etoile candidate. The last main character from Miator is Chiyo Tsukidate, a timid first year student who is employed as the [[Maid|room temp]] for Nagisa and Tamao.

;St. Spica's Girls' Institute
Hikari Konohana, a shy and quiet girl, is the main focus among the main characters who attend Spica, much like Nagisa at Miator; she too has three girls wanting to get close with her. The first of these girls is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl whom is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. Both she and Hikari are members of the St. Spica Choir, though Hikari is the more skilled and diligent of the two.<ref name="SP8">{{cite video|people=Tsubomi Okuwaka|title=Strawberry Panic! episode 8|medium=Anime|publisher=[[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]|date=[[May 22]] [[2006]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story whom is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale due to often riding a horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by much of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, though she does not enjoy so much attention.<ref name="spmanga1"/> The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts mature for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir though her main reason for joining was for Hikari.{{-}}

;St. Lulim's Girls' School
Out of the three schools, St. Lulim has the least emphasis on romance between characters, though the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice or simply a shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hy<U+016B>ga, a very outgoing and hyper girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to a new person. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, whom is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. When it comes to the two of them, Kizuna is more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, the youngest of the group whom is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear, {{Nihongo|Percival|<U+30D1><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30D0><U+30EB>|P<U+0101>shibaru}} which she often talks to as if it were alive. While she does not talk or express her own emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are deeply distraught or in emotional pain.

==Setting==
[[Image:Astrea Hill.png|thumb|200px|right|Aerial view of Astrea Hill. Locations include: Strawberry Dorms (top), Lulim (left), Miator (bottom), church and library (center), and Spica (right).]]
===Astrea Hill===
The setting of ''Strawberry Panic!'' is {{Nihongo|Astrea Hill|<U+30A2><U+30B9><U+30C8><U+30E9><U+30A8><U+30A2><U+306E><U+4E18>|Asutoraea no Oka}}, a very large hilltop where the three affiliated schools of Miator, Spica and Lulim, are located.<ref name="sevenseas"/> The hill is known as a sacred area where no men are allowed to enter.<ref name="ncsx"/> The students residing on campus stay in a dormitory often referred to as the Strawberry Dorms. A prominent feature on Astrea Hill is a very large [[Catholic]] church in the center of the hill near a small lake; the church can be seen from a vast distance away.

Other places that are frequented by the characters include the library on the lake's shore, and the horse ranch which is located at Spica. Astrea Hill was originally designed having the three schools in a triangle formation with the Strawberry Dorms in the center. The church was placed nearest to Miator's dormitory.<ref name="Jan04"/>

===Schools===
There are three all-girl schools that are located nearby each other on Astrea Hill. Each school has its own student council that governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically, the three student councils, including the Etoiles, will meet in what is referred to as the Astrea Joint Student Council. Topics discussed at the joint meetings include communal matters that affect the three schools equally such as the Etoile Election. The school system employs a different system in the numbering of the grades; at Astrea Hill, students are ranged from grades one through six:

;St. Miator's Girls' Academy
[[Image:St. Miator school seal.png|thumb|80px|left|St. Miator's school emblem.]]
:{{Nihongo|St. Miator's Girls' Academy|<U+8056><U+30DF><U+30A2><U+30C8><U+30EB><U+5973><U+5B66><U+5712>|Sei Miatoru Jogakuen}} is the oldest of the three schools and holds the longest legacy; St. Miator's school is known for holding old traditions. It was founded on a monastery and is seen as the school for "brides", reinforced by the existence of extracurricular classes including [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], [[Ikebana|flower arrangement]], and Japanese dancing.<ref name="Jan04">{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=January 2004|pages=134-136|language=Japanese}}</ref> It is not unusual for students to be engaged before graduation.<ref name="Jan04"/> School rules include number seven, do not show your teeth when laughing at a public place, and number nine, bowing should be done at a thirty degree bend from the waist.<ref name="Jan04"/> The school has long black dresses for its uniforms, created in the [[Gothic Lolita]] fashion. In the spring, the uniforms are mostly green and have short sleeves. These uniforms appear to be traditional in nature, continuing the theme of Miator's long standing history at Astrea Hill. At Miator, the [[Class (education)|class]] names are associated with objects from nature, such as {{Nihongo|moon|<U+6708>|tsuki}}, {{Nihongo|flower|<U+82B1>|hana}} and {{Nihongo|snow|<U+96EA>|yuki}}.<ref name="MWcharacterpage"/>

:In the Strawberry Dorms, there is a concept called the room temp system that only occurs for students from Miator. Every underclassman entering these dorms, if they are chosen to serve the upperclassman as room temps, will be given an important chance to show their affection to them. Room temps perform maid duties, which includes cleaning the room of the students they were assigned to serve. They must bring suggestions to their upperclassmen first before making decisions on their own regarding the decoration of the upperclassman's room. When the story begins, the current Etoile, Shizuma, is attending Miator, which gives the school a lot of power.
<span id="Spica"></span>
;St. Spica's Girls' Institute
[[Image:St. Spica school seal.png|thumb|80px|right|St. Spica's school emblem.]]
:{{Nihongo|St. Spica's Girls' Institute|<U+8056><U+30B9><U+30D4><U+30AB><U+5973><U+5B66><U+9662>|Sei Supika Jogakuin}} is the school that has the white colored buildings and uniforms, which makes the students of St. Spica look professional; it was built after Miator. The school prizes itself in advancing the independence of women who play a role in improving society.<ref name="Jan04"/> They are well known for their culture and how accomplished their sports program is compared to the other two schools. Spica has what is known as the St. Spica Choir, or the "Saintly Chorus", which consists of students from Spica that perform at special events and even concerts for students at Astrea Hill. At Spica, the class names are numbers in French, such as ''un'' (one), ''deux'' (two), and ''trois'' (three).<ref name="MWcharacterpage"/>

:School rules include number thirteen, relations outside of campus must first have the approval of the school and guardians, and number twenty-six, underwear and gloves must be white; other colors are prohibited.<ref name="Jan04"/> In the spring their uniforms carry blue trim and have shorter sleeves, though otherwise it is almost the same as the autumn uniforms. Spica and Miator both oppose each other quite strongly, which often ends in them having disputes when students from these two schools get together.
<span id="Lulim"></span>
;St. Lulim's Girls' School
[[Image:St. Lulim school seal.png|thumb|80px|left|St. Lulim's school emblem.]]
:{{Nihongo|St. Lulim's Girls' School|<U+8056><U+30EB><U+30FB><U+30EA><U+30E0><U+5973><U+5B66><U+6821>|Sei Ru Rimu Jogakk<U+014D>}} is the newest of the three schools which has pink colored buildings and uniforms. Their uniform is modeled after a traditional [[Japanese school uniform]] style which in effect makes them look immature compared to the other schools' students. In the spring their uniforms do not change very much other than having shorter sleeves for the shirt and a necktie. At Lulim, the class names are the letters from the [[Latin alphabet]]: A, B, C, etc.<ref name="MWcharacterpage"/> Lulim was originally named Le Lim.<ref name="Jul04"/>

:Students at St. Lulim's have a tradition to be free and laid back, and are rarely seen fighting. The students at the school enjoy a lot of freedom in terms of activities, like the clubs they are allowed to form. In effect, there are a wide range of clubs at St. Lulim's ranging from dancing, to cooking, to anything else a group of at least three people can think up. School rules include number five, always wear the uniform of the school properly when going out, and number eight, a senior must always protect a lower grade student, teaching and leading her.<ref name="Jan04"/>

====Etoile system====
{{Nihongo|'''Etoile'''|<U+30A8><U+30C8><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30EB>|Etow<U+0101>ru}} is a [[French language|French]] word meaning ''[[star]]''. The Etoile system of Astrea Hill is employed as the internal politics between the schools and governs school operations. The system is designed for two Etoiles to be instated at the same time in order to work as a team. In the anime, Shizuma Hanazono is the sole Etoile, which is explained in the latter part of the story. The two Etoiles are seen as [[figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]]s for Astrea Hill. While Astrea has three schools, both Etoiles must come from the same school. The Etoiles have certain specific duties, such as greeting new students coming to Astrea Hill, participating in important school events, and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, among other duties. They are given a private greenhouse to grow flowers in for use during school events.  

The Etoiles are elected after going through what is known as {{Nihongo|''The Etoile Election''|<U+30A8><U+30C8><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+9078>|Etow<U+0101>ru-sen}}, which consists of three specific competitions for the participants to take. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. For instance, in the manga, the first part of the election is called the "Cadette Selection" and is referred to in [[French language|French]] as ''La Brillante Ouverture'' meaning ''The Brilliant Opening''.<ref name="spmanga1">{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 1|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=2006}}</ref> During this event, the younger of the two in each pair have to answer general questions about Astrea to make sure that they have at least a minimal level of knowledge about the schools. In the anime, the election began with the previous Etoile handing a [[bouquet]] of flowers to each of the candidates that have been there the longest at Astrea and saying "Good luck".<ref name="anime26">{{cite video|title=Strawberry Panic!, episode 26|medium=Anime|publisher=[[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]|date=[[September 25]] [[2006]]}}</ref> A ballroom dance is an important aspect later in the election. The dance serves as an expression of gracefulness between the candidates, proving they are able to interact and work well together.<ref name="spmanga1"/>

Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election. During this time, the student council president from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for colors of the [[pendant]]s: one is red, the other blue. The [[Senpai|older student]] receives the blue pendant while the younger of the two receives the red pendant.<ref name="anime26"/>

===Strawberry Dorms===
[[Image:Strawberry Dorms2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Strawberry Dorms.]]
Students living on campus reside in a [[dormitory]] referred to as the {{Nihongo|''Strawberry Dorms''|<U+3044><U+3061><U+3054><U+820E>|Ichigo Sha|lit. ''Strawberry House''}}. The building is a triangular shape for the purpose of separating students from the three schools so that each section is roughly the same size. It was built about 100 years before the beginning of the story, around the same time that Miator was established. Though originally planned for students whose homes are far away, it has come to house the children of distinguished families who are able to experience group life in its embraces.<ref name="Jan04"/> At first, the dormitory was not a single building but three separate dormitories arranged in a triangle formation around a central courtyard.<ref name="Jan04"/>

Upon entering housing, each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. This helps the students form special relationships with their roommate which can evolve into [[intimate relationship]]s. When there are not enough students entering in a given year for everyone to have a roommate, a student in such a situation must live alone until a student transfers into their respective school. Transfers must be in the same year as their roommate. The building name is based on the resemblance from an above cross-section of a strawberry. One of the dormitory's rules is number twenty-one, lights out by 10 p.m., and further activities are forbidden.<ref name="Jan04"/>

Traditionally, students in the Dorms can take an optional three days and two nights of "summer school"; this is misleading since [[Academia|academics]] are not involved. The students take a trip to a local beach and have fun with their friends, making it an opportunity to strengthen friendships while outside the campus. It is said that an interesting event occurs every year which excites the students about the prospect of going.<ref name="SP11">{{cite video|people=Tamao Suzumi|title=Strawberry Panic! episode 11|medium=Anime|publisher=[[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]|date=[[June 12]] [[2006]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>[[Image:SP! library.png|thumb|168px|right|The Astrea Library.]]

===Astrea Library===
The students may go and study for their classes at a library on Astrea Hill. Students in the Library Club volunteer librarian services at the library.  Their tasks generally consist of lending out library items such as books, umbrellas, and other items to students and keeping the library organized. Chiyo Tsukidate and Mizuho Kan<U+014D>, one of Shizuma's good friends, are two of the librarians.

The library has an additional purpose besides reading and studying. Though only implied in the anime, the manga explains that the library building has another name - "The Secret Garden". It is a well-known place on campus to have a secret lovers' [[rendezvous]], or meeting.<ref name="spmanga2">{{cite book|last=Kimino|first=Sakurako|title=Strawberry Panic! manga volume 2|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=2006}}</ref>

==Adaptations==
===Short stories===
{{main|Strawberry Panic! (short stories)}}
''Strawberry Panic!'''s origin was in the October 2003 issue of the Japanese [[bish<U+014D>jo]] magazine ''[[Dengeki G's Magazine]]'' where it was announced after the ending of [[Sakurako Kimino]]'s previous work ''[[Sister Princess]]'' that a new reader participation project would start the following month.<ref name="Oct03">{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=October 2003|language=Japanese}}</ref> In the November 2003 issue, the first batch of characters from St. Miator were introduced and it was revealed how readers could participate in the project. The initial system had the three main girls of Nagisa, Hikari, and Kizuna (given without surnames) who were sisters and at the same time younger sisters of the readers of the magazine, effectively putting the reader in the position of the elder brother. Each girl entered her respective school and became the protagonist of that school. It was explained that the coupling of the main characters could be to an upperclassman, a classmate, or an underclassman, but had to stay within the school they attended. The readers had the ability to influence the coupling formations.

In December, the characters from Spica and Lulim were introduced and in the January issue the first illustrations of the three schools and the Strawberry Dorms were published, drawn by [[Chitose Maki]]; the reader participation game began in that issue. Polls were posted in the January 2004 issue where the readers could vote on how the story would start and progress in the following months. Before the votes were counted, the first three short stories were written and published in the February 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''. Each story featured an illustration of the two girls who were the couple paired in each respective story.<ref name="Feb04"/>

The reader participation ended after nine rounds of voting in the February 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' where it was announced that the series would be continued in other forms, such as the light novels and manga that followed.<ref name="Feb05">{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=February 2005|pages=163-174|language=Japanese}}</ref> The original short stories and the poll results of the reader participation game were used as a basis for subsequent releases of ''Strawberry Panic!''. Between May and September 2005, a revision of the series was produced, publishing five more supplementary short stories once a month over the period. After the ending of the short complition in September 2005, it was decided that the original illustrator, [[Chitose Maki]], would no longer be illustrating the series and it was decided that [[Namuchi Takumi]] would continue as the main artist.

===Internet radio show===
Between November 2005 and December 2006, [[Lantis (company)|Lantis Web Radio]] hosted a radio show entitled {{Nihongo|''[[List of Strawberry Panic! albums#Web radio CDs|Mai & Ai no Dengeki G's Radio Strawberry Panic! ~Oneesama to Ichigo S<U+014D>d<U+014D>~]]''|<U+9EBB><U+8863>&<U+611B><U+306E><U+96FB><U+6483>G<U+2019>s<U+30E9><U+30B8><U+30AA> <U+30B9><U+30C8><U+30ED><U+30D9><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30FB><U+30D1><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>!~<U+304A><U+59C9><U+69D8><U+3068><U+3044><U+3061><U+3054><U+305D><U+3046><U+3069><U+3046>~}}. The show was hosted by [[Mai Nakahara]], who voiced Nagisa Aoi in the anime edition, and [[Ai Shimizu]], who voiced both Tamao Suzumi and Kizuna Hy<U+016B>ga in the anime. The show contained sixty-one episodes which were divided between three CDs; the first went on sale on [[March 8]] [[2006]]. The other two releases came out on [[July 5]] [[2006]] and [[January 11]] [[2007]] in Japan. The radio show was frequented by nine guests who had done other [[seiy<U+016B>|voice acting]] roles from the anime version and one other guest, [[CooRie|Rino]], who had sung the opening theme of "Sweetest" to the PlayStation 2 game version.

===Manga===
The ''Strawberry Panic!'' manga, written by [[Sakurako Kimino]] and illustrated by [[Namuchi Takumi]], was first produced in ''Dengeki G's Magazine'' on [[September 30]] [[2005]]; a new chapter is released once a month. As of March 2007, two [[Tank<U+014D>bon|bound volumes]] have been released. The first went on sale on [[March 27]] [[2006]] featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on [[October 27]] [[2006]] featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. A third volume is set to be released, though a date has not yet been specified. Major differences between the anime and manga centers around the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion T<U+014D>mori and Kaname Kenj<U+014D>. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until the latter part of the series for dramatic effect.

===Light novel===
The announcement that a ''Strawberry Panic!'' [[light novel]] series was to be written based on the original short stories was in the April 2005 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine''. The following month in May, the novels started to be written and illustrated by the same two people who worked on the manga. The announcement that the writing of the novels was finished was in the September 2005 issue of the same magazine, though the first novel was published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] on their publishing label ''[[Dengeki Bunko]]'' on [[March 10]] [[2006]]. The first volume had Shizuma and Nagisa on the cover and the second volume, released on [[August 9]] [[2006]], had Amane and Hikari on the cover. The third and last volume, released on [[December 10]] [[2006]], had Chikaru and Kizuna on the cover.

[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] announced on [[September 13]] [[2006]] that they had licensed the right to release the [[English language|English]] translations of the ''Strawberry Panic!'' light novels and the manga series. Due to delays, Seven Seas Entertainment has not set a date for the release of the light novels, but the first volume of the manga will be released in November 2007.<ref name="sevenseas">{{citeweb|url=http://www.gomanga.com/manga/strawberrypanic.php|title=Seven Seas Entertainment website on Strawberry Panic!|accessdate=2007-01-14}}</ref>{{-}}

The anime series of ''Strawberry Panic!'', which started airing in [[Japan]] on [[April 3]] [[2006]], and concluded [[September 25]] [[2006]], has a central [[Yuri (animation)|yuri]] theme. The anime series contains twenty-six episodes, most of which are based on the short stories and manga that preceded it. The anime focuses mainly on Nagisa Aoi and Hikari Konohana and the three love interests they each have that are vying for their affections. [[Fan service]], or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only for brief intervals.

The anime has been released in Japan periodically; the first [[boxset]], "Strawberry Panic DVD Box I" (in regular and special editions), was released on [[June 23]] [[2006]]. The boxset contained the first and second episodes of the series, "Cherry Blossom Hill" and "Etoile". The second boxset, titled "Strawberry Panic DVD Box II" (in regular and special editions), was released on [[July 25]] [[2006]], featuring the third episode "Attic", the fourth episode, "You on the White Horse", and the fifth episode, "Younger Sisters". The regular and special editions of the boxset are similar in content, but the special editions are packaged in jacket sleeve, and contain an original booklet which includes other merchandise, such as portable plates and straps. The special edition includes different versions of the opening and closing themes, and deleted scenes.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.strawberrypanic.com/product/index.html|title=List of Strawberry Panic! products at Strawberrypanic.com|accessdate=2006-06-30|language=Japanese}}</ref>

The game is played over the course of a school semester; the first day of school is on [[April 1]]. Each day concludes with a [[super deformed]] image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an email message from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the [[Computer display|monitor]]. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a [[Speech balloon#Thought bubbles|thought bubble]] above her head. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The games uses an angel/devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters.<ref name="ncsx"/>

==Reception==
When voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of ''Dengeki G's Magazine'', they were to determine who would be the subjects in the couplings between the characters of each respective school.

The three couples that had the highest number of votes were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes.<ref name="Mar04">{{cite book|title=Dengeki G's Magazine|publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]|date=March 2004|pages=127-137|language=Japanese}}</ref> The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls.

The ''Strawberry Panic!'' short stories were initially panned by Erica Friedman as being "distinctly derivative of ''[[Maria-sama ga Miteru]]''."<ref name="okazu">{{citeweb|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date=[[April 11]] [[2006]]|url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic.html|title=Okazu: Yuri Anime: Strawberry Panic|accessdate=2007-02-03}}</ref> Friedman is the president of [[Yuricon]], an [[anime convention]] geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of anything else to support it."<ref name="okazustories">{{citeweb|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date=[[June 16]] [[2004]]|url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2004/07/yuri-reviews-strawberry-panic.html|title=Okazu: Yuri Reviews: Strawberry Panic!|accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref> After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version,<ref name="okazu"/> Friedman later changes her opinion slightly, writing that "[the anime] turned out pretty good."<ref name="okazufinal">{{citeweb|first=Erica|last=Friedman|date=[[September 28]] [[2006]]|url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/09/yuri-anime-strawberry-panic.html|title=Okazu: Yuri Anime: Strawberry Panic|accessdate=2007-03-03}}</ref> She goes on to say, "There<U+2019>s no denying that ''Strawberry Panic!'' wasn<U+2019>t brilliant, but considering that it was meant to be trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap."<ref name="okazufinal"/>

''Strawberry Panic!'' was one of the premier titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for [[Yuri (animation)|yuri manga]]) production lines when it was licensed for [[English language]] distribution by [[Seven Seas Entertainment]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/manga-articles/101/|title=Interview with Adam Arnold from Seven Seas Entertainment|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, "How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?" His response was, "We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like ''[[Pita-Ten]]'', ''[[Shinigami no Ballad]]'' or ''Strawberry Panic!''....In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may not have heard of the property otherwise."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/features_gomanga_012.php|title=Interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref>
