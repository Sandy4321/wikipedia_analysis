'''Omanis in the United Arab Emirates''' consist of expatriates and residents in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (U.A.E.) who hail from [[Oman]]. Being a bordering country and sharing cultural links, there are thousands of [[Omani people]] who live in the U.A.E. They are predominately Arabs and belong to the Muslim [[Ibadi]] sect. 

Omanis make a large percentage of the UAE's office corps and also dominate the police forces.<ref>[http://www.jepeterson.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/Future_of_Federalism_in_UAE.pdf J.E. Peterson. The Future of Federalism in the United Arab Emirates], pp. 18</ref>
Many are originally students pursuing higher education in various institutions across the country. In 2003, their number was estimated at over 9,000.<ref name="V"/> According to the ''Times of Oman'', the United Arab Emirates is the most popular destination for Omani students who choose to study abroad; its close location and sharing of the language and culture makes them more comfortable at places like [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Sharjah]] and the border town of [[Al Ain]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofoman.com/innercat.asp?detail=39494|title=More Omanis opting to study overseas|first=Aftab H.|last=Kola|work=Times of Oman|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref>

Both countries have signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at providing benefits to Omani nationals and citizens in the UAE as well as treating Omani labour and work force at par with the country's nationals.<ref name="MOU">{{cite news|url=http://www.oeronline.com/php/2006_july/inthe_news.php|title=Omani workers to get same status as UAE nationals|date=July 2006|work=Oman Economic Review}}</ref> Being a member of the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)]] (like the UAE) enables Omani nationals to move and work freely within the country and enjoy contrasting residential benefits as compared to expatriates in the UAE from non-GCC states.  

In 2003, Omanis in the UAE were allowed to vote for council members in the elections of the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman|Omani Majlis al-Shura]]. It was the first-ever overseas [[suffrage]] in Oman's history.<ref name="V">{{cite news|url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press6/162S25.htm|title=Omanis in UAE allowed to vote in Shura council polls|first=Barbara|last=Bibbo|work=[[Gulf News]]|date=September 28, 2003|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref>
