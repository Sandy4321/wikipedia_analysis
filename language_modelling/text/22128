| quote       = During the scorched-earth policy of the invading American militia during the War of 1812, all mills along the Erie shore as far as the Grand River were burned to the ground.  All, that is, except the mill belonging to John Backhouse, and Tisdale's mill in Vittoria.  Speculation has it that he was to related to key people in the United States.

During the [[War of 1812]] [[United States|American]] soldiers burned all the mills on Lake Erie`s north shore, from the [[St Clair River]] to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], except for the Backhouse mill, and one other.
According to Ron Brown, in <U+2033>The Lake Erie Shore: Ontario's Forgotten South Coast<U+2033>, Backhouse`s mill was skipped due to powerful connections within the USA.

The [[South Norfolk Railway]] reached Port Rowan in 1886.<ref name=ForgottenSouthCoast/>
It was acquired by the [[Canadian National Railway]], which operated it until 1965.

In 1970 [[Ontario New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] MPP [[Morton Shulman]] asserted that Port Rowan was the destination of secret meetings of [[mafia]] leaders.<ref name=WindsorStar1970-10-08>

==Economy==

During the 18th century fishing, milling, and timber processing were the main industries, exploiting the water power of nearby watercourses.<ref name=ForgottenSouthCoast/>
In 1850 the town processed {{convert|4000000|m|ft|disp=or}} of timber.  1850 marked the beginning of shipbuilding in Port Rowan.

With the decline of the fishing, lumber and milling industries, tourism is the main economic activity in the region.
Local sports include [[angling]] and [[boating]] in the Long Point Inner Bay and golfing at Stark's Golf Course at the edge of town. [[Bird Studies Canada]]  is based at Port Rowan. Port Rowan's future growth is currently at capacity with its water treatment system, which threatens future growth in the town and its burgeoning retirement community.

Its proximity to [[Long Point, Ontario|Long Point]], a major bird flight-path, and World Biosphere Reserve, makes Port Rowan a popular destination for [[bird-watcher]]s.<ref name=CalgaryHerald2012-08-26>
