== Personal life ==
Kipyego went to Moi Kapcherop Girls High School in [[Kapcherop]], [[Marakwet District]]. Her elder brothers, [[Mike Kipyego]] and Christopher Kipyego, are also runners.<ref>Daily Nation, July 17, 2011: [http://www.nation.co.ke/Features/Guess+whos+chasing+the++Kenyan+dream/-/960656/1202800/-/ce12a8/-/index.html Track queen and scholar rolled into one]</ref>

When Kipyego was four years old, her father died, leaving her mother alone to raise seven children. The family was poor and her mother was often sick. When Kipyego was eleven, her brother's friend suffered an injury in a bicycle accident. Kipyego ran seven miles to the nearest clinic but the doctor was intoxicated and kicked her out. These events gave Kipyego the desire to become a nurse so she could help provide better healthcare in her native country.<ref name=Nursing>{{cite news|url=http://www.redraiders.com/stories/060307/tra_060307034.shtml|title=Texas Tech's Kipyego has one last task before starting next phase of her life|work=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]|date=2007-06-03|accessdate=2007-06-30}}</ref>

Kipyego first enrolled at [[South Plains College]] in [[Levelland, Texas]]. After transferring to [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]], she applied to the [[nursing]] program in February 2007. Kipyego received an acceptance letter and began her first nursing class on July 5, 2007.<ref name=Nursing />  Kipyego earned her nursing degree May 2009.
