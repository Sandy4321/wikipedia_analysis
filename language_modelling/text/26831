'''Helga Lekamens Gr<U+00E4>nd''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "Alley of the Holy Body") is an [[alley]] in [[Gamla stan]], the old town in central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Connecting [[V<U+00E4>sterl<U+00E5>nggatan]] to [[Stora Nygatan]], it forms a parallel street to [[Stora Gr<U+00E5>munkegr<U+00E4>nd]] and [[G<U+00F6>ran H<U+00E4>lsinges Gr<U+00E4>nd]].

The alley is mentioned as ''Helge lycama grendh'' in 1505, named after ''Helga Lekamens gille'', "[[Guild]] of the Holy [[Body of Christ]]", during the Middle Ages the biggest guild in Sweden, appearing in historical records in the 14th century and known to count royalties among its members.  The accounts of the guild from the 15th and 16th centuries is still an important historical source offering glimpses of the Medieval era.  While many such charity alliances were named after the Body of Christ, the guild in question apparently fell into oblivion following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], as the name of the alley was shortened to ''Lekamegr<U+00E4>nden'' in the early 17th century, to be renamed ''Lilla Gr<U+00E5>munkegr<U+00E4>nd'' ("Smaller [[Greyfriar]]s Alley") in 1722.  To avoid confusion the old historical name was however resumed in 1922.<ref name="gatunamn">{{cite book
