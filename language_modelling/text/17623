According to Kinnaman, he also was close to getting the lead role in the films ''[[Thor (2011 film)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Mad Max 4]]''. He told the newspaper ''<U+00D6>stran'' that "it was really close that I got the lead role in ''Mad Max 4''. It stood between me and two others, and the one who got the role was [[Tom Hardy]] who plays the lead role in the film ''[[Bronson]]''. [...] [The director] was very pleased <U+2014> but they needed someone who gave an older impression."<ref name="Helmerson"/> Although he admits that he is eager to work and become recognized in America, he says that "I absolutely don't feel that I have to take any role that I can get just because it is the United States. I'm looking for something interesting, I'm still young in my artistry, and I must dare to do things even when there's a risk for failure."<ref name="Helmerson"/> 

Kinnaman has both a Swedish and an American citizenship, because his father comes from the United States.<ref name="Helmerson"/> [[Melinda Kinnaman]], a Swedish actress, is Joel's sister.
