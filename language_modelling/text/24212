'''Roland Meredith Starr''' ([[December 29]], [[1890]] - [[December 13]], [[1971]]), whose birth name was '''Herbert Close''', was born in Prestbury House, Hampton, at [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] in the County of [[Middlesex]], [[England]] to well-to-do land owning parents (''"[[Landed property|landed proprietor]]s"'') William Brooks Close and Mary Baker Brooks Close. When Starr was one year old his parents separated and he was raised by his mother. He received his education at [[Winchester College]] in [[Hampshire]]. Starr was a [[psychologist]], [[homeopath]], [[Occult|occultist]] and an editorial writer. He was also the principle player in bringing the Indian guru [[Meher Baba]] to the west (England and the [[United States]]) for the first time in the start of the [[1930s]], although he himself did not remain a follower of Meher Baba's for very long. 

In the early 20th century, Starr wrote for ''[[The Occult Review]]'', an illustrated monthly magazine containing articles & correspondence by many notable occultists of the day, including [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], W.L. Wilmhurst, [[Franz Hartmann]], [[Florence Farr]], and Herbert Stanley Redgrove. He probably changed his name to Meredith Starr when he was twenty in relation to his work as a reviewer and contributor for ''The Occult Review''. He also wrote for Aleister Crowley's publication ''[[The Equinox]]'', publishing ''Memory of Love'' (under the name "Herbert Close"), VII, 291 - Vol 7, in [[1911]]. 

Meredith Starr met [[Meher Baba]] in Toka, [[India]] on June 30, [[1928]]. In [[1931]] Starr established a retreat center at East Challacombe, North [[Devon]], where he invited Meher Baba to come and meet westerners. It was at the Devon retreat that many of Meher Baba's lasting followers from Europe and the United States first met Baba. Meredith was famously lacking in a sense of humor and had a particular sense of how spiritual conduct should be, thus enforcing strong codes of serious contemplative conduct that made even Meher Baba uncomfortable. Yet he is considered to have played a central role in introducing Meher Baba to the western world. 

Later, Starr grew irritated with Meher Baba, writing him a letter commanding, "Give me either the 400 pounds you owe me or illumination; otherwise, I will leave you and expose you as a fraud!" He then did leave Meher Baba.

He was married first to Lady Mary Stamford and then to Margarget Starr (or Margarita Alison Starr), to whom he was married in London in 1917. He is buried in Municipal Cemetery, Krikley, Suffolk. He was survived by two children, Gordon Mettreyya and Meredith John Grey.

:''O DREAD Desire of Love! O lips and eyes!''<br>
:''O image of the love that never dies,''<br>
:''But, fed by furtive fire, rages most''<br>
:''When Hope and Faith have been for ever lost!''<br>
:''O oft-kissed lips and soul-remembered eyes,''<br>
:''O stricken heart -- the old love never dies!''<br>

:''O Passion of dead lips that used to cling''<br>
:''To warm red living ones that breathed no pain!''<br>
:''O Passion of dead hours that daily bring''<br>
:''To life some phantom pale that died in vain! ...''<br>
:''Some echo tuned to Memory's dying strain,''<br>
:''Some witness of the immemorial spring!''<br>
