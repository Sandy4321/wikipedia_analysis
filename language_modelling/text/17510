Despite a few [[rebellion]]s, Assyria functioned as an important part of the Achaemenid Empire.

==Fall of the Assyrian Empire==
[[Image:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Assyrians lay waste to [[Susa]], [[Elam]], 647 BC. In less than 40&nbsp;years the same fate would befall [[Assur]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Harran]].]]
Between the 9th and 7th centuries BC, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] dominated the Middle East militarily and politically,<ref>Healy, Mark. The Ancient Assyrians. New York: Osprey, 1991. (various pages) ISBN 1855321637</ref> and at one point, the Persians and their neighbors the [[Medes]] were vassals of Assyria and paid tribute. In the late 7th century BC, however, the Assyrians suffered a number of calamities that led to the sacking of the old capital [[Assur]] by the Medes, who then combined forces with [[Babylon]] and sacked the new capital [[Nineveh]] in 612 BC. The [[Battle of Nineveh]] eventually left Assyria destroyed for years to come. The Assyrians continued to fight on, with the aid of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] who feared the rise of the Babylonians. Harran, the new Assyrian capital, was eventually taken in 608 BC.<ref>"Wisdom of Egypt and the Old Testament" By W. O. E. Oesterley. Page 31.</ref> Despite this, the Egyptians later sent another force to assist the Assyrians in 605 BC.<ref name="Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat">{{cite news |first=R.G. |last=Grant |title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat |publisher=London: Dorling Kindersley |page=19 |date=2005 |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref>

A costly but victorious  [[Battle of Megiddo (609 BC)|battle at Megiddo]] against the forces of [[Judah]] allowed the Egyptians to advance to the rescue, only to be defeated by the Babylonian-Median alliance. Assyria was conquered by Babylonia.<ref name="Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat"/> Babylonian rule was unpopular, but did not last long. When the Babylonian King [[Nabonidus]] made war with Persia, he was defeated by an outnumbered [[Cyrus the Great]] at the [[Battle of Sardis]] in 546 BC. Cyrus's armies took Babylon and made it, along with Assyria, into provinces of the Persian Empire.<ref name="Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat"/>

==Athura as part of the Achaemenid Empire==
Inhabitance at the former major Assyrian capitals was sparse during the Achaemenid rule. Assyrian settlement were mostly in small villages at plain level or on mounds such as Tell ed-Darim. Despite most of the Assyrian land was left in ruins from the battles that led to the fall of its empire in the [[7th century BC|previous century]], rural Assyria was prosperous according to the Greek scholar [[Xenophon]].<ref>Arrian, [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], III.7.3.</ref> After passing Nimrud and Nineveh (which he described in ruins), Xenophon and the Greeks turned north-west, following the east bank of the [[Tigris River]], he described rural Assyria as:
{{cquote| 
..there was an abundance of corn in the villages, and found a palace, with many villages round about it...In these villages they remained for three days, not only for the sake of the wounded, but likewise because they had provisions in abundance <U+2013> flour, wine, and great stores of barley that had been collected for horses, all these supplies having been gathered together by the acting satrap of the district.<ref>[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], book III.IV. pages 18, 24-32).</ref>}} 

The testimony is an example of the rich agricultural resources of Athura's region and the existence of a satrap<U+2019>s palace.
It is not known exactly where this palace was located, but Layard suggest it may have been near [[Zakho]].<ref>Layard, A.H., 1853. Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, p. 61 and 686</ref>

Prior to the Persian rule of Assyria, The Achaemenids were greatly Assyrianized,<ref>"The 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project", Muhammad Dandamayev, R. M. Whiting. 41-48.</ref> and Aramaic continued as the [[lingua franca]] of the Empire in the region, with the [[Assyrian script]] being the everyday writing system. Local religion within the empire were tolerated, and the judicial system, [[Assyrian calender|calendar]] and imperial standards imposed by the Assyrians remained in force everywhere.<ref>"Syria-Palestine under Achemenid Rule", by Israel Eph'Al. in: The Cambridge Ancient History 2nd Edition, Vol. 4. Page 147-161.</ref> 

The Assyrians, like all other tributary peoples of the Persian Empire, were obliged to pay taxes to the King of Persia and, whenever the King campaigned, supply troops as well. Reliefs of Assyrian tribute bearers carved on the east and north sides of the Apadana, consist of seven bearded men: one carrying [[leather|animal skins]], one carrying a length of cloth, two carrying bowls, and two leading [[Mouflons]].<ref>Briant, P., 2002. From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire, Winona Lake, Indiana. Page 175.</ref>

===Rise of Aramaic===
The Assyrian Empire resorted to a policy of deporting conquered peoples into the lands of Mesopotamia and, in turn, settling Assyrian colonists in newly conquered lands. In this way it was hoped that a multi-cultural society would form. While this allowed some integration, it may have also led to the various rebellions within the Empire in the 7th century. By the 6th century, the many peoples in Mesopotamia spoke many languages, most of which were a derivative of Aramaic. Consequently, during the Persian rule of Assyria, Aramaic gradually became the main language spoken by the Assyrians.<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today">{{cite journal

Even before the Empire fell, many could speak Aramaic, and the ruling elite of Assyria needed to have been bilingual, capable of speaking both [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and Aramaic.<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today"/> The conquest of Assyria and the violent destruction of the cities meant that these bilingual skilled individuals died with their language and the Aramaic script was incorporated into the Assyrian culture by around the late 6th century BC.<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrian Identity in Ancient Times and Today"/>

Following the Achaemenid conquest of Assyria under Darius I, the [[Aramaic language]] was adopted as the "vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages." <ref name="Iranica">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic<!-- pp:250-261 --><!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp:251/252-->|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250<U+2013>261}} p. 251</ref> The use of a single [[official language]], which modern scholarship has dubbed "Official Aramaic" or "Imperial Aramaic", and be assumed to have greatly contributed to the success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.<ref name="Iranica"/> Imperial Aramaic was highly standardized; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of Persian gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. In 1955, [[Richard Frye]] questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an "official language", noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Frye|first=Richard N.|title=Review of G. R. Driver's "Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C."|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=18|issue=3/4|year=1955|pages=456-461}} p. 457.</ref> Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the "''[[lingua franca]]''" of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought. 

For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenids, Imperial Aramaic <U+2013> or near enough for it to be recognizable <U+2013> remained an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and <U+2013> as ideograms <U+2013> Aramaic vocabulary survived as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi|Pahlavi writing system]].<ref>{{citation|author1-link=Wilhelm Geiger|first1=Wilhelm|last1=Geiger|first2=Ernst|last2=Kuhn|year=2002|title=Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1|location=Boston|publisher=Adamant|pages=249ff}}.</ref>

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the [[Persepolis]] fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.<ref>{{citation|first=John A. Matthew|last=Stolper|title=What are the Persepolis Forti<U+FB01>cation Tablets?|journal=The Oriental Studies News & Notes|issue=winter|year=2007|pages=pp. 6<U+2013>9|url=http://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html|accessdate=2007-02-13}}</ref> Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], and [[Elephantine]] in particular. Of them, the best known is the ''Wisdom of Ahiqar'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[book of Proverbs]]. Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

A group of thirty Imperial Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] were recently discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BCE Achaemenid provinces of Bactria and [[Sogdiana]].<ref>{{citation|title=Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria|series=Studies in the Khalili Collection|last1=Naveh|first1=Joseph|last2=Shaked|first2=Shaul|isbn=1-874-78074-9|publisher=Khalili Collections|location=Oxford|year=2006}}</ref>

===Revolt of Assyria, 520 BC===
In 520 BC the two Assyrian Provinces of Mada and Athura revolted against the Persian Empire.<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrians after Assyria">{{cite web |first=Simo |last=Parpola |title=Assyrians after Assyria |url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |format=HTML |publisher=University of Helsinki |page= |date=1999-09-04 |accessdate= |language=English |quote= }}</ref></blockquote> Though the revolt was quickly suppressed, it illustrated that the two regions acted in unison, suggesting perhaps a cultural link. Having said this a rebellion could occur in several different parts of an Empire for geographical reasons and it may have been that the whole of the Mesopotamia region became swept with rebellion.

===Campaigns===
Although the effectiveness of the Assyrian army was shown to be poor in its collapse, the soldiers of Assyria continued to be brave and fierce warriors. Most soldiers at the time would not wear heavy armor, but rather than act as [[melee]] troops, would serve as [[skirmishers]]. The Assyrian troops were different however, since they fought as archers, cavalry and heavy infantry and were useful as front line troops.  The Assyrian infantry was specifically trained to engage in hand-to-hand.<ref>Shadows in the Desert: Ancient Persia at War By Kaveh Farrokh, Page 76.</ref> A massive army was assembled by Xerxes  in the early 5th century BC. Contemporary estimates place the numbers between 100,000 to over a million. Whatever the number, it was enormous and the Persians summoned troops from all across their realm. Herodotus remarks that Assyrian soldiers were employed in [[Persian Wars#Xerxes' Invasion|Xerxes' expedition to Greece]].<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrians after Assyria"/>
{{cquotetxt|The Assyrian contingent wore on their heads either bronze helmets or plaited helmets of a peculiarly foreign design which is hard to describe. Their shields, spears, and daggers, resembled Egyptian ones, and they also carried wooden clubs with iron studs, and wore.''|Herodotus|<ref>Herodotus, The Histories, transl. Harry Carter, Book Seven (New York: The Heritage Press, 1958), p 431.</ref>}}

===Influence of Assyrian art on Achaemenid sculpture===
[[Image:Sphinx Darius Louvre.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Assyrians of Athura were responsible for the glazing of the Palace and have influenced Persian art to some extent.]]
The Assyrians continued to serve the Persians under King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] who was at his time considered the greatest ruler, often styling himself as "King of Kings." He ruled as a king over many other powerful subordinates and, as such, it was believed that a great palace should be built at the Persian city of Susa. The Assyrians were employed in the construction of this building, albeit with many other tributary peoples as well as Persians themselves. The Western Assyrians of Athura were closer to Mount Lebanon, where fine trees could be found and timber processed for Darius' grand Palace. The Eastern Assyrians of Mada were charged with excavating gold.<ref name="Simo Parpola Assyrians after Assyria"/>

Assyrian influence over Achaemenid art and sculpture can be seen in various areas of the empire. Examples include the doorway relief of the palaces in [[Pasargadae]],<ref name="John Curtis"/>  and in the [[Bukan]] area (near [[Urmia]]) where various tiles are decorated with human-headed winged figures, lions, and [[ibex]]es.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=a0IF9IdkdYEC&pg=PA5&dq=%22influence%22+achaemenid&sig=4jyZJO5qSPqTbhZ8ScDxcVFKvpA Birth of the Persian Empire] By Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis, Sarah Stewart.

Dandamaev, Vladimir G. Lukonin. p 342.</ref>
But perhaps the best example of Assyrian influence can be observed in the "Gate of all Nations" in [[Persepolis]], with two [[Lamassu]]s (human-headed winged bull) in the entrance.<ref name="John Curtis">[http://books.google.com/books?id=kJnaKu9DdNEC&pg=PA54&dq=Gate+of+All+Nations&sig=LevZnCErFnmwAmeAo369h62YZEc#PPA54,M1 Forgotten empire: the world of Ancient Persia] By John Curtis, Nigel Tallis, B<U+00E9>atrice Andr<U+00E9>-Salvini. Page 54.</ref> The Assyrian lamassu, however, was used to protect the palace from evil spirits, while those of Persepolis expressed meditative calm and humanity. [[Iranologist]] and [[Assyriologist]] have tried to answer the question of how was the influence transmitted. Possibilities include contacts between Athura and Persia were frequent and Achaemenid architects visited the Assyrian palaces. Other suggest Assyrian slaves were brought back to Persia to have them work on the new palaces.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Curtis |first=John |year=2003 |month=November | location =Paris, France |title=The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq |journal=L<U+2019>arch<U+00E9>ologie de l<U+2019>empire ach<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>nide |pages= various pages|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf}}</ref>

===Economy===
[[Image:Northern Iraq landscape.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Athura became one of the wealthiest provinces, due to its fertile land.]]
As with many other countries, the primary occupation was farming.<ref name= "Bertman 244"/> The large output of Mesopotamian farms resulted in highly populated civilizations.<ref name= "Bertman 244"/> The chief crop that fueled the ever-growing civilizations in the region was the grain barley and enumer wheat though sesame seeds also provided a source of nourishment.<ref name= "Bertman 244"/> Like much of the rest of the world at the time, the economy of Athura relied heavily upon the produce of the farms and the rivers, including fish and what fruit and meat could be raised in the Euphrates' fertile soils. The agricultural year began with sowing after summer. Flooding posed a serious risk to farmers, whilst rodents were supposedly driven off by prayers to the rodent god.<ref name= "Bertman 245">Bertman, Stephe. p. 245.</ref> To ensure that such prayers were answered, tall silos were built to house the grain and keep out the mice.

Trees were grown for their fruit. To prevent the hot winds of the region from destroying the crops, tall palm trees were planted around the smaller trees, thus breaking the wind and shading the plants from the heat of the sun, the intensity of which provided plenty for the plants, even when shaded.<ref name= "Bertman 245"/> Following the Persian conquest, peaches were added to the original Assyrian mix of apples, cherries, figs, pears, plums and [[pomegranates]].<ref name= "Bertman 245"/> Tree growing was an art mastered with tree-cutting and even "artificial mating" in order to have the Palm trees yield fruit.<ref name= "Bertman 245"/> In the north, rainfall in Athura met the demands of farming but in the more southernly parts (covering Mada) [[Shaduf]]s were used to assist in irrigation.<ref>Bertman, Stephen. p. 264. </ref>

Oxen, donkeys, cattle and sheep were raised, the latter for their milk (which could be turned into butter) and the former as draught animals. Pigs, ducks, geese and chickens were all raised for their meat. Hunting supplemented the food supply with birds and fish.<ref>Bertman, Stephen. p. 265.</ref>

The down-time resulting from farming and the seasons allows men and women to master other skills in life such as the arts, philosophy and leisure. Without the fertile soils of the [[Euphrates]] river valley, civilization would not have come to be.<ref name= "Bertman 244">{{cite book|last=Bertman|first=Stephen|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=New York|publisher=Oxford UP|year=2005|pages=p. 244}}</ref>

===Archaeological findings===
====Nimrud====
[[Nimrud]]'s buildings were dramatically destroyed during the sacking of 614<U+2013>612 BC. However, evidence of reoccupation during the "post-Assyrian period" (612<U+2013>539 BC) is noted in various areas, including the Palace of [[Adad-nirari III]], the North-West Palace, the Burnt Palace and Nabu Temple complex, Fort Shalmaneser, and the Town-Wall Houses.<ref>Curtis, John. (2004) "The Assyrian heartland in the period 612-539 BC."</ref>

[[Xenephon]] passed by the Nimrud (which he called Larissa) in 401 BC along with 10,000 Greek soldiers and described the city as 
{{cquote| a large deserted city<U+2026> Its wall was twenty-five feet in breadth and a hundred in height, and the whole circuit of the wall was two parasangs. It was built of clay bricks, and rested upon a stone foundation twenty feet high<U+2026> Near by this city was a pyramid of stone, a plethrum in breadth and two plethra in height; and upon this pyramid were many barbarians (Assyians) who had fled away from the neighbouring villages.<ref>[http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/x/xenophon/x5an/book3.html Anabasis book III] by Xenophon.</ref>
}}

Despite Xenephon<U+2019>s description of the city as being abandoned, archaeological evidence seems to show that there was some Achaemenid-period occupation. Phase 3 or H in the Nabu Temple complex and Burnt Palace is described as Achaemenid occupation.<ref>Mallowan, M.E.L., (1966.) "Nimrud and its Remains." London.</ref> They include traces of kilns on the south side of Room 47 in the Burnt Palace, together with red glass ingots and slag, which after a radiocarbon analysis yielded a date of 425 +/- 50 BC.<ref>Barag, D., 1985. "Catalogue of Western Asiatic Glass in the British Museum I", p. 108<U+2013>9. London.</ref> In the Nabu Temple, a pipe lamp and a group of seven pottery vessels are considered to be "ascribed to the Achaemenid period."<ref>Oates, D. and J., 1958. "Nimrud 1957: the Hellenistic settlement", Iraq 20: 114-157.</ref> There was also some Achaemenid occupation in the South-East Palace: a deep footed bowl, a hemispherical bowl (which is compared with pottery from the Achaemenid village at Susa)<ref>Ghirshman, R., 1954. Village Perse-Ach<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>nide, p.25</ref>, and three pottery vessels.<ref>Oates, D. and J., 1958. "Nimrud 1957: the Hellenistic settlement", p. 12<U+2013>14</ref> Also in the South-East Palace were two "eye of Horus" amulets, often regarded as hallmarks of Achaemenid period material culture. Another eye of Horus amulet has been found in the Town Hall Houses. In the palace of Adad-nirari III, three bronze kohl sticks with castellated heads having been identified as Achaemenid period.

====Assur====
Like other Assyrian capitals, [[Assur]] was greatly destroyed during the battles of the century before. The importance of the city thereafter is not clear, but much evidence indicate it was a flourishing city during the Achaemenid rule. After the Babylonian conquest by [[Cyrus the Great]], the "[[Cyrus Cylinder]]" mentions Assur as one of the cities of which cult statues were returned.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Curtis |first=John |year=2003 |month=November | location =Paris, France |title=The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq |journal=L<U+2019>arch<U+00E9>ologie de l<U+2019>empire ach<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>nide |pages=12 |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf}}</ref>
In 401 BC, Xenephon describes the city as 
{{cquote|A large and prosperous city named "Caenae" (Assur<ref>Andrae, W., 1977. Das wiedererstandene Assur, new impression edited by B.Hrouda, M<U+00FC>nchen.</ref><ref>Oates, D., 1968.

IV. 28</ref> From this city, the barbarians (Assyrians) brought over loaves, cheeses and wine, crossing upon rafts made of skins.}}
At the Assur Temple, two shrines have been identified as being built during 5th to 3rd century BC.<Ref>Roaf, M.D., 1983. "Sculptures and Sculptors at Persepolis."</ref> A few graves at the site also may have been belonged to the Achaemenid period. From the grave site, a pair of circular earrings with globules has clearly been identified as Achaemenid.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Curtis |first=John |year=2003 |month=November | location =Paris, France |title=The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq |journal=L<U+2019>arch<U+00E9>ologie de l<U+2019>empire ach<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>nide |pages=12<U+2013>3 |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf}}</ref> These earrings are similar to the silver earring found at [[Khorsabad]], near Nineveh. In another grave, Haller dates grave number 811 as Achaemenid period.<Ref name="Haller">Haller, A., 1954. Die Gr<U+00E4>ber und Gr<U+00FC>fte von Assur, WVDO-G 65, Berlin.</ref> The grave contained three bodies, a stamp-seal showing the goddess, Ishtar, standing on the back of a lion. This might indicate that [[Ashurism]] was still being practiced within the Assyrian population during the Achaemenid rule. Other objects from the grave 811 include a bronze fibula; another earring, but gold rather than the earlier described silver; different kinds of beads of silver, agate, frit and glass; an alabastron; a bowl made of copper; and two pottery bottles.<Ref name="Haller"/> It is not clear, however, if all the items are Achaemenid in date.

====Tel ed-Daim====
To the northeast of [[Kirkuk]], the site of Tel ed-Daim shows significant evidence of Achaemenid rule.<ref>al-Tekriti, A.Q., 1960. "The excavations at Tell ed-Daim (Dokan)", Sumer XVI: 93-109</ref> A small fortified palace (most probably for a local governor) includes a bronze wall-plaques, a bronze snaffle-bit of a type well-known from Achaemenid contexts at Persepolis, kohl tubes with ribbed decoration tapering, and pottery.<ref>Forgotten empire: the world of Ancient Persia By John Curtis, Nigel Tallis, B<U+00E9>atrice Andr<U+00E9>-Salvini.

====Eski Mosul Dam Salvage Project====
In Eski Mosul Dam Salvage Project, a few items have been identified as Achaemenid period. The project was located to the northwest of [[Mosul]], in the upper Tigirs valley, and within the Assyrian heartland. In the Kharabeh Shattani site, various amounts of pottery have been dated Achaemenid. These include, four bowls of which have similarities of Achaemenid bowls in Susa and Pasargadae.<ref>Simpson, St.J., 1990. <U+2018>Iron Age crop storage and ceramic manufacture in rural Mesopotamia: a review of the British Museum excavations at Qasrij Cliff and Khirbet Qasrij in Northern Iraq<U+2019>, 119-140.</ref> Other times include clay spindle whorls, two iron sickle blades, and a bronze plate optimistically identified as a horse<U+2019>s forehead plaque. A bronze finger-ring with a crouching animal engraved on the bezel was also found in the site and is considered to be widespread in the Achaemenid empire.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Curtis |first=John |year=2003 |month=November | location =Paris, France |title=The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq |journal=L<U+2019>arch<U+00E9>ologie de l<U+2019>empire ach<U+00E9>m<U+00E9>nide |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf}}</ref> Also in the project, a grave site excavated found bodies that included a conical kohl pot and a bronze pin with a castellated top. These objects are considered to be distinctive Achaemenid type.<ref>[http://www.aina.org/articles/curtis.pdf The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq], by [[John Curtis]].

==Assyria after the Achaemenid Period==

[[Image:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Coin of Alexander bearing an Aramaic inscription reflect the continuous impact of the Assyrian language after the Achaemenid period.]]

In the late 4th century BC [[Alexander the Great]] led his Greco-Macedonian army to conquer the Achaemenid Empire. The empire's vast territory and numerous tributary peoples ensured that rebellion would be a constant problem. This new Greek Empire relied upon the administrative system put in place by the Persians to govern these new lands; consequently, the Assyrian lands of Athura and Mada were administrated as such by their own Satraps. When Alexander the Great died, the Greek successor state of the Seleucid Empire retained control of much of the Persian Empire.

Whilst Greek rule beyond the Euphrates was subject to constant and eventually successful Persian incursions, Assyria was forced to take the role of a frontier province in the later Persian dynasties against the expansions of the Selucids and later on the Romans. Greek rule in the East did not last long even though the cultural impacts did - by the mid-3rd century BC the [[Satraps]], administrators of the various provinces in the Seleucid Empire began revolting against the Seleucid Empire in [[Persia]] and [[Bactria]] establishing their own domains. A temporary revival of Seleucid Power re-established Imperial authority in these regions in the late 3rd and early 2nd century BC but after which the Parthians soon came to incorporate the lands known as Assyria once again by the mid-2nd century BC. 

Parthian rule aimed to emulate that of their Persian predecessors, the Achaemenids with a similar system of administration involving Satraps and smaller provinces. Indeed the main rebel behind the rise of Parthia from Seleucia was a Satrap himself.<ref name="Bentley">{{cite book|last=Bentley|first= Jerry H.|aocauthors=Herb F. Ziegler|title=Traditions & Encounters a Global Perspective on the Past|volume=1|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill|years=2006}}.</ref> On top of this, the Parthian Empire was more decentralized and power was shared amongst clan leaders,<ref name="Bentley"/> hinting at the possibility of the retention of the provinces. [[Mesopotamia]] became the Heartland of the [[Seleucid Empire]] with a new capital, [[Seleucia on the Tigris]] founded. As a result, much culture and knowledge was exchanged between the Greeks and the Assyrians. The invasions of Alexander the Great consisted not only of soldiers but scientists and Historians.<ref name="Parker">Parker, Geoffrey. Compact History of the World. 4th ed. London: Times Books, 2005 pg 33 ISBN 0760725756</ref>

Beginning in the 1st century BC, the Romans began expanding their Empire at the cost of the [[Parthians]]. Initially the Nomadic military tactic of circling and shooting worked to deadly effect against the slow heavy moving infantry of the Romans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first=R.G.|title=Battle a Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location=London|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2005|pages=p. 43}}, "Carrhae was a disaster for the Roman empire in the east."</ref> In time however, superior technology and strategy drove the Parthians out of the [[Mediterranean]] and most of [[Asia Minor]]. The Parthians continued to resist Roman rule, invading and in turn being invaded by the Romans many times, with their capital [[Ctesiphon]] being sacked three times.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=Geoffrey|title=Compact History ofthe World|location=London|publisher= Times Books|year=2005|pages=p. 37}} map shows temporary acquisitions of "Assyria" and "Mesopotamia" provinces</ref> The consequence of these bloody and inconclusive wars meant that the Assyrian provinces bore the brunt of the fighting, with Assyrian troops fighting for one side and then, at the change of the governing of the lands of Mada and Athura, fighting for the other side. Naturally such events served to undermine the Assyrians.

By the 2nd century AD under the [[Emperor Trajan]], the Romans began to achieve the upper hand against the Parthians and established the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]] along the Euphrates and Tigris.
