Wetherall played in the game when against arch-rivals [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1997 when [[Roy Keane]] badly injured his knee. Keane later took revenge on [[Alf Inge Haaland]] during a Manchester derby and said to him as he lay on the ground: "And don't ever stand over me again sneering about fake injuries, and tell your pal (David) Wetherall there's some for him as well."<ref>{{cite news

===Bradford City===
After more than 200 league games in eight seasons at Leeds United, Wetherall left on [[30 June]] [[1999]] to join West Yorkshire rivals [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], who paid a club record [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1.4 million.
