{{otherships|HMS Monmouth}}

'''HMS ''Monmouth''''' was the [[lead ship]] of [[Monmouth-class cruiser|her class]] of 10 [[armoured cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the first decade of the 20th century. She was assigned to the [[1st Cruiser Squadron]] of the [[Channel Fleet]] upon completion in 1903. She was transferred to the [[China Station]] in 1906, and remained there until she returned home in 1913 and was assigned to the [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] Third Fleet. When [[World War I]] began in August 1914, the ship was [[Ship commissioning|recommissioned]] and assigned to the [[5th Cruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|5th Cruiser Squadron]] in the Central Atlantic to search for German [[commerce raider]]s and protect [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] shipping. She was detached upon arrival to patrol the Brazilian coast for German ships, and was later ordered to the South Atlantic to join [[Rear Admiral]] [[Christopher Cradock]]'s squadron in their search for the [[German East Asia Squadron]]. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock's force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock's two armoured cruisers in the [[Battle of Coronel]]. ''Monmouth'' was lost with all hands. 

==Design and description==
''Monmouth'' was designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|9800|LT|t}}. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|463|ft|6|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|66|ft|m|1}} and a deep [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|25|ft|m|1}}. She was powered by two 4-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of {{convert|22000|ihp|lk=in}} designed to give a maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn|lk=in}}. ''Monmouth'', however, was one of three of the ''Monmouth''s that failed to meet her designed speed. The engines were powered by 31 [[Belleville boiler]]s.<ref name=ck8>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 70</ref> She carried a maximum of {{convert|1600|LT|t}} of coal and her complement consisted of 678 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=f6>Friedman 2012, p. 336</ref>

Her main armament consisted of fourteen [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading (BL)]] [[BL 6-inch Mk VII naval gun|6-inch Mk VII guns]].<ref>Friedman 2011, p. 81</ref> Four of these guns were mounted in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft of the superstructure and the others positioned in [[casemate]]s amidships. Six of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.<ref>Friedman 2012, pp. 251<U+2013>52, 260<U+2013>61</ref> They had a maximum range of approximately {{convert|12200|yd}} with their {{convert|100|lb|adj=on}} shells.<ref>Friedman 2011, pp. 80<U+2013>81</ref> Ten [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder 12 cwt guns]] were fitted for defence against [[torpedo boat]]s.<ref name=f6/> ''Monmouth'' also carried three [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss|3-pounder]] [[Hotchkiss gun]]s and two submerged [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch]] [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=ck8/>
 
The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|armour belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|4|in|0|spell=in}} and was closed off by {{convert|5|in|adj=on|0|spell=in}} transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was four inches thick while the casemate armour was five inches thick. The protective [[deck (ship)|deck]] armour ranged in thickness from {{convert|.75|-|2|in|mm|0}} and the [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|10|in|0|spell=in}} of armour.<ref name=ck8/>

==Construction and service==
''Monmouth'', named for the [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Welsh county]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 252</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[London and Glasgow Shipbuilding Company|London and Glasgow Shipbuilding]] at their [[shipyard]] in [[Govan]] on 29 August 1899,<ref name=ck8/> and [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 November 1901.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval & Military Intelligence |day_of_week=Thursday |date=14 November 1901 |page_number=9 |issue=36612| }}</ref> She was completed on 2 December 1903<ref name=ck8/> and was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. She was briefly placed in reserve in [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] at the end of January 1906, before being recommissioned in April for service on the China Station.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 12</ref> ''Monmouth'' remained there until 1913, when she returned home and was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet.<ref>Friedman 2012, p. 249</ref>

She was mobilised on 4 August with a crew that mostly consisted of reservists,<ref>Massie, p. 203</ref> and sent to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of Rear Admiral [[Archibald Stoddart]] on the [[Cape Verde]] <U+2013> [[Canary Islands]] station. Upon her arrival on 13 August, Stoddart detached her to the Brazilian coast to search for the German light cruisers known to be in the area. She came under Cradock's command in mid-September.<ref>Corbett, Vol. I, pp. 41, 43, 258, 309</ref> At the end of September, Cradock made his first fruitless search of the [[Tierra del Fuego]] area and later detached ''Monmouth'' and two other ships to search up the Chilean coast, reaching [[Valparaiso]] on 15 October, while his flagship, {{HMS|Good Hope|1901|2}} returned to [[Port Stanley]], in the [[Falkland Islands]], to recoal and to reestablish communications with the [[Admiralty]]. He received word on 7 October that German Vice Admiral [[Graf Maximilian von Spee|Spee]]'s ships were definitely bound for the Cape Horn region and waited for the elderly [[predreadnought battleship]] {{HMS|Canopus|1897|2}} to reinforce his squadron. She was in poor mechanical condition when she arrived at Port Stanley and required time to make repairs. ''Good Hope'' sailed on 22 October without her, going around [[Cape Horn]], while ''Canopus'' and three [[collier (ship type)|collier]]s departed the following day, taking the shorter route through the Strait of Magellan.<ref>Massie, pp. 210<U+2013>19</ref>
 
===Battle of Coronel===
{{main|Battle of Coronel}}

''Good Hope'' rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron at Vallenar Roads, in the remote [[Chonos Archipelago]] of Chile on 27 October to recoal. They departed two days later, just as ''Canopus'' arrived, Cradock ordering the battleship to follow as soon as possible. He sent the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Glasgow|1909|2}} to scout ahead and to enter [[Coronel, Chile]] to pick up any messages from the Admiralty and acquire intelligence regarding German activities. The cruiser began to pick up German [[radio]] signals from the light cruiser {{SMS|Leipzig}} on the afternoon of 29 October, and delayed entering Coronel for two days with Cradock's permission to avoid being trapped by the fast German ships. A German supply ship was already there and radioed Spee that ''Glasgow'' had entered the harbour around twilight. The cruiser departed on the morning of 1 November, but Spee had already made plans to catch her when informed of her presence the previous evening.<ref>Massie, pp. 221<U+2013>24</ref>

''Glasgow'' departed Coronel at 09:15 after having picked up the squadron's mail, and rendezvoused with the rest of the squadron four hours later. Cradock ordered his ships to form line abreast with a distance of {{convert|15|nmi}} between ships to maximize visibility at 13:50 and steered north at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. At 16:17 ''Leipzig'' spotted ''Glasgow'', the easternmost British ship, to its west and she spotted ''Leipzig''{{'}}s [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] smoke three minutes later. At 17:10 Cradock ordered his ships to head for ''Glasglow'', the closest ship to the Germans. Once gathered together, he formed them into line astern, with ''Good Hope'' in the lead, steering southeasterly at {{convert|16|kn}} at 18:18. As the sixteen {{convert|21|cm|adj=on}} guns aboard the armoured cruisers [[SMS Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}} were only matched by the two 9.2-inch guns on his flagship, he needed to close the range to bring his more numerous 6-inch guns to bear. The [[Beaufort scale|Force 7 winds]] and high seas, however, prevented the use of half of those guns as they were too close to the water. He also wanted to use the setting sun to his advantage so that its light would blind the German gunner. Spee was well aware of the British advantages and refused to allow Cradock to close the range. His ships were faster than the British, slowed by the 16-knot maximum speed of the [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{HMS|Otranto||2}}, and he opened up the range to {{convert|18000|yd}} until conditions changed to suit him. The sun set at 18:50, which silhouetted the British ships against the light sky while the German ships became indistinguishable from the shoreline behind them.<ref>Massie, pp. 223<U+2013>28</ref>

Spee immediately turned to close and signaled his ships to open fire at 19:04, when the range closed to {{convert|12300|yd}}. Spee's flagship, ''Scharnhorst'', engaged ''Good Hope'' while ''Gneisenau'' fired at ''Monmouth''. The German shooting was very accurate, with both armoured cruisers quickly scoring hits on their British counterparts while still outside of six-inch gun range, starting fires on both ships. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee's ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half of that when the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. One shell from ''Gneisenau'' blew the roof off ''Monmouth''{{'}}s forward turret and started a fire, causing an ammunition explosion that completely blew the turret off the ship.
Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only {{convert|5500|yd}} away at 19:35. Severely damaged, ''Monmouth'' began to slow and veered out of [[line of battle|line]].<ref>Massie, pp. 228<U+2013>30</ref>

''Glasgow'' fought almost an entirely separate battle as the German armoured cruisers ignored her almost completely and she inconclusively dueled the light cruisers {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and {{SMS|Dresden||2}}. ''Glasgow'' broke contact with the German squadron at 20:05 and discovered ''Monmouth'', [[list (watercraft)|listing]] and down by the bow, having extinguished her fires, 10 minutes later. She was trying to turn north to put her stern to the heavy northerly swell and was taking water at the bow. There was little that ''Glasgow'' could do to assist the larger ship as the moonlight illuminated both ships and the Germans were searching for them.<ref>Massie, pp. 232<U+2013>33</ref> 

The light cruiser [[SMS N<U+00FC>rnberg (1906)|''N<U+00FC>rnberg'']] had been trailing the German squadron and spotted the plume of smoke from ''Glasgow'' at 20:35, and then saw ''Monmouth'' with a 10-degree list to port shortly afterwards. As ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' closed the range, ''Monmouth''{{'}}s list increased so that none of the guns on her port side could be used. The German cruiser closed to within {{convert|600|yd}} and illuminated her flag with its spotlight in the hopes that she would [[Striking the colors|strike her colours]] and surrender. There was no response from the British ship and ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'' opened fire at 21:20, aiming high, but there was still no response. The German ship then fired a torpedo which missed and turned off its searchlight. ''Monmouth'' then increased speed and turned towards ''N<U+00FC>rnberg'', which caused her to open fire again. ''Monmouth'' [[capsized]] at 21:58, taking her entire crew of 735 men with her as the seas were too rough to attempt any rescue effort.<ref>Massie, pp. 233<U+2013>34; Silverstone, p. 252</ref>
