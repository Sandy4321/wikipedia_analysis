She lives in [[Berlin]]. 

Bronsky's debut novel ''Broken Glass Park'' ([[Europa Editions|Europa]], 2010)<ref>http://www.europaeditions.com/book.php?Id=85</ref> was described by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' as "a vivid description of contemporary adolescence under pressure." ''Broken Glass Park'' was nominated for the prestigious [[Festival of German-Language Literature|Ingeborg Bachmann Award]] in 2008 <ref>http://bachmannpreis.eu/de/archiv/830</ref> and  for the German Young Adult Literary Prize in 2009. The novel was adapted into a movie starring Jansa Fritzi Bauer with a planned US release in 2015.  

Following the success of ''Broken Glass Park'', Bronsky's ''The Hottest Dishes of the Tartar Cuisine'' (Europa, 2011)<ref>http://www.europaeditions.com/book.php?Id=114</ref> was long-listed for the [[German Book Prize]] in 2010, named a favorite read of 2011 by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and was selected as one of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'''s Ten Best Books of the Year.
