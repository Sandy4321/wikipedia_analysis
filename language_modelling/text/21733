== Biography ==
B<U+00E9>la B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was born in 1919 in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary. The oldest of four sons, his father Peter was a minister of the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher.<ref name=jenink> {{cite journal|title=A Biography of B<U+00E9>la H.

===Youth spent in Hungary===
When B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was about six years old, their family informally adopted Tamas Feri. Tamas was about 13 years old and from a poor gardener family. Tamas took B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy on his first overnight camp out with his patrol to a small forest near [[Gyula]]. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's father then became the Scoutmaster of the "small scouts" troop (similar to American [[Cub Scouts]]).<ref name=pinebhb /> 

When B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was nine years old, he became the troop leader and during one national holiday, led the troop in a parade. About that time, the entire troop spent two weeks camping at a church camp at [[Le<U+00E1>nyfalu]], north of [[Budapest]]. The church groups lived in wooden barracks, but B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's troop stayed in tents, "as Scouts are supposed to do."<ref name=pinebhb />

The family moved about {{convert|84|km|mi}} from Banathy's birthplace of Gyula, to [[Mako]], Hungary, about {{convert|202|km|mi}} southeast of [[Budapest]]. He joined the regular scout program of the Hungarian Scout Association and "Csanad Vezer" Troop 92. The troop had over 50 Scouts and 30 "small scouts" during the 1930s. They held their monthly troop meetings on Sunday in a large [[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazium]] (secondary school) and met weekly every Saturday as a patrol. B<U+00E9>la reported, "Our weekly patrol meetings focused on scoutcraft and Scout spirit and guiding us to move through the various stages of advancement in rank."<ref name=pinebhb />

The Hungarian Scout program had four stages. During the first three years, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy advanced three stages. The last stage required B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called [[Turul]], after the mythical bird of Hungary.<ref name=pinebhb /> From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp.<ref name=pinebhb />

Members of B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's troop attended the [[4th World Scout Jamboree|1933 World Jamboree]] where he would make a life-changing decision. Up to this time, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy had decided to follow his father into the ministry. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy wrote,

{{quote|
The highlight of the Jamboree for me was meeting [[Baden Powell]], the Chief Scout of the World. One day, he visited our camp with the Chief Scout of Hungary, [[Count]] [[P<U+00E1>l Teleki]] (who later became our Prime Minister), and the chief of the camp staff, [[Vitez]] Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army. A few years later he became the commander of the Royal Ludovika Akademia (when I was a student there). In the 1940s, he became the Chief Scout of Hungary. (I was serving on his staff as head of national junior leadership training.)

For me the Jamboree became a crucial  career decision point. I resolved to choose the military  as a life work... There were two sources of this decision. One was my admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, and his life-example as a hero of the British Army and the founder and guide of scouting. The other was the influence of Captain Varkonyi, a staff officer of the Jamboree, who was assigned to our Subcamp. We spent hours in conversation about scouting and the military as a career, as a major service in the character development  of young Hungarian adults. After the Jamboree we corresponded for a while. By the end of the year I shared my decision with my parents. <ref name=pinebhb>{{cite web | title=B<U+00E9>la's Story: Scouting in Hungary, 1925-1937 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| author=Lew Orans| accessdate=2008-08-15| date=1996-12-14}}</ref>}} 

While at the Jamboree, he briefly met Joseph Szentkiralyi, another Scout from Hungary. Hungarian Sea Scout Paul Ferenc Sujan and American Maurice Tripp also attended, and all three men would more than 20 years later play a key role in helping B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy build a leadership program for youth in the United States.

Also in 1933, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy attended the regional patrol leader training week. Later in  1934, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy and six other members of his troop traveled to the National Jamboree in Poland. They camped in a large pine forest and visited [[Krakow]] and [[Warsaw]]. The Polish government hosted a banquet for all of the Scouts in the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]].<ref name=pinebhb />  In 1934, he was awarded the best notebook prize of the national spring leadership camp and in 1935, he was invited to serve on the junior staff of the same camp at [[List of districts in Budapest|Harshegy]], [[Budapest]].<ref name=pinebhb />

In 1935, the troop traveled to the [[B<U+00FC>kk Mountains]] in northeastern Hungary for their summer camp. As a Senior Patrol leader, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy and two others took a bicycle tour in advance of the summer camp to preview the camping site.<ref name=pinebhb />

===Military service during World War II===
The two military men that B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy had met, and from whom he developed a desire to serve in the military, soon played roles on the national stage that would affect B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy. 

In 1940, General Farkas, the commanding officer of Ludovika Akad<U+00E9>mia<ref>[http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovika_Akad%C3%A9mia Ludovika Akad<U+00E9>mia]</ref> (officer training school), whom B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy had met at the 1933 Jamboree, invited B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy to teach junior leader training at the academy. He also asked B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy to organize a Scout Troop for the young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy found a passion in training the young men in officer's leadership skills and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the [[Magyar Cserk<U+00E9>szsz<U+00F6>vets<U+00E9>g|Hungarian Scout Association]]. He was commissioned in the [[Mechanized infantry |armored infantry]] later that year and met his future wife Eva Balazs during this time.  

Hungary was generally an [[Hungary during World War II|unwilling member of the Axis]], and Germany continually pressured it to play a greater role. [[P<U+00E1>l Teleki]], whom B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy had met at the [[4th World Scout Jamboree|1933 World Jamboree]], was [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary |Prime Minister of Hungary]]. He and [[Regent]] [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]] tried to keep Hungary out of the war, though their national pride prompted them to seek a reversal of the geographic injustice of the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]. This Germany promised them. Through the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Agreement of 1938]] they gained part of Czechoslovakia, and via the [[Vienna Award]]s they gained additional territory.

In Yugoslavia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Lazar Markovi<U+0107> secretly traveled to Vienna and signed the [[Tripartite Pact]]. On his return, the military, who had not supported joining with Germany, were led by Air Force General Richard Simovic in a bloodless ''[[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]]''. Simovic immediately refuted his country's signature on the alliance. This threatened Germany's planned invasion of Russia, potentially exposing its southern flank. Germany responded with a plan to invade and compel [[Belgrade]]'s support for the Axis and suggested that Hungary should also attack. Teleki refused, and the Germans asked permission to transport their troops across Hungary. 

The British, with whom Teleki had had a long relationship, sent word via the Hungarian Minister in London that they would declare war if he assented. Teleki heard soon afterwards that Regent Horthy and Chief of Staff of the Hungarian Army, General Henrik Werth, had permitted the Germans to cross Hungary's borders. On 3 April 1941, he took his own life. [[Winston Churchill]] later wrote, "His suicide was a sacrifice to absolve himself and his people from the guilt in the German attack on Yugoslavia<U+2026>"<ref>{{Cite book | author=Churchill, Winston; Keegan, John | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The Second World War  Volume 3, "The Grand Alliance"|date=| publisher=Mariner Books | location= | isbn=978-0-395-41685-3 | pages=148}}</ref> Parts of Yugoslavia were annexed to Hungary, in response, the United Kingdom broke off diplomatic relations on December 1 that year.

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy served two tours on the [[Eastern front|Russian front]] in [[World War II]] as an armored infantry officer. In 1941, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's unit advanced during a severe November ice storm within {{convert|140|km|mi}} of Moscow. Wounded, he returned from the front to Budapest and married his fianc<U+00E9>, Eva Balazs, with his arm in a sling. In 1942, he returned to the Russian front with the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Magyar Honved]]. Having grown the peace-time Hungarian Army very quickly from an initial force of 80,000, the rank-and-file of the Hungarian Army had undergone only eight weeks of training.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Mollo, Andrew; McGregor, Malcolm; Turner, Pierre | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=The armed forces of World War II: uniforms, insignia, and organization | date=1981 | publisher=[[Crown Publishers]] | location=[[New York, N.Y.]]  | isbn=0-517-54478-4 | pages=207}}</ref>

They rapidly  destroyed the Hungarian Second Army near [[Svoboda]] on the [[Don River]]. During its 12 months of activity on the Russian front, the Second Hungarian Army's losses were enormous.

In July 1944 B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's mentor General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps which had been garrisoned at [[Debrecen]]. He replaced General Beregfy, loyal to the [[Arrow Cross Party]].

</ref> As an Hungarian officer, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy knew he would likely be executed if captured. He was able to get his wife Eva, one year old son B<U+00E9>la and two-week old son L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> out of Budapest. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's family, along with General Farkas and other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches. 

Unable to replace the equipment and personnel lost in the [[Battle of Debrecen]], the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944. The remaining units of the Second Army, including the unit in which B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy served, were transferred to the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Hungarian Third Army]]. The [[Siege of Budapest]] began when the city was first encircled on 29 December 1944 by the [[Red Army]]. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy continued to fight with the remainder of his unit against the Russians after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945. The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around [[Lake Balaton]]. However, by late March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna.<ref>Dollinger, Hans. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.'' p 199. ISBN 978-0517123997</ref> The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the Transdanubian Mountains towards Austria.

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's family with the other family members of the remainder of his military unit made their way west, along with tens of thousands of other refugees, about {{convert|250|km|mi}} into Austria, trying to stay ahead of Russian advances. Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near {{convert|0|C|F}}.

===Life in displaced persons camp===
B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy reunited with his family in Austria, and as the war ended and Austria was occupied in April 1945 by the Austrian, British, Soviet and US governments, they were placed in an Allied [[displaced persons camp]]. They were housed in an single {{convert|6|by|10|ft|m}} room in a wooden barrack which served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and place for firewood storage. Food was extremely scarce and they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day for five years.<ref>{{cite news | first=Authur A. | last=Noyes | coauthors= | title=Austrian Food Must Be Cut, UNRRA Says | date=March 7, 1946 | publisher= | url =http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm#article9 | work =Stars and Stripes | pages = | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | language = }}</ref> They were among 1.4M displaced persons in Austria at the time<ref>{{cite web |title= The  Early Occupation Period| url=http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|date=2001-09-23

With extremely little food available in the camps, in early 1947 Eva's twin sister came from Hungary and took the two older sons back to live with her older sister. The Pallendal family was well-educated and  relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps, and they intended to return the boys after a year. In 1948, when the [[Cold War]] ensued, the two boys were trapped behind the [[Iron Curtain]].<ref name=jenink />  

Shortly after their third son Tibor was born, the family was moved to another camp, near a [[Marshall Plan]] warehouse, where B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy began unloading sacks of wheat from railroad cars. In 1948 their fourth son Robert was born.

Seven year old B<U+00E9>la and six year old L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>, along with their grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent towards Russia. As was the practice, the train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off. The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary, and an uncle was able to locate them and hide them from authorities in a small village in eastern Hungary.<ref name=belabio />

===Emigrates to the United States===
In January, 1951, the student body of the [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in Chicago<ref name="herald"/> sponsored B<U+00E9>la, Eva, Tibor and Robert as [[immigrants]] to the United States. B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's family lived in the Seminary, and B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy labored nights 60 hours a week in the cellar of the Seminary, shoveling coal to fire the furnace, while studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. Eva found work in a paper factory and Tibor, their third son, entered American public school.<ref name=wshistory />

===Begins teaching Hungarian language===
Unknown to B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy, his former commanding officer General [[Vit<U+00E9>z]] Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas visited the United States and his former adversaries, the [[United States Army]], during early 1951. He recommended B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy as a [[Hungarian language]] instructor, and B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was invited to teach at the [[U.S. government]]'s [[Defense Language Institute| Army Language School]] in [[Monterey]], [[California]].<ref name=wshistory>{{cite web | title=White Stag History Since 1933 |url= http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html#2565| author=Brian Phelps| accessdate=2008-08-15| date=2000-06-14}}</ref> B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy accepted the job at the Army Language School, moving to Monterey in June 1951.

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy at the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] [[Indaba]] held at [[Fort Ord]], California, during November, 1962. These four men along with Paul Sujan played instrumental roles in developing new [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] and [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] programs that for the first time focused on leadership skills, not [[Scoutcraft]] skills.]] 
Following on his interest in leadership development for youth that he had nurtured in Hungary, in 1957 B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy began experimenting with a concept for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the [[Monterey Bay Area Council]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], he proposed the idea to the Council Executive and Board and received broad support. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (later Anglicized as St. Clair) and Paul Sujan; Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (also a member of the National Council and a research scientist). B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy, St. Clair, Sujan and Tripp had all attended the 4th World Jamboree in Hungary, where B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy and St. Clair had briefly met.<ref name=wshistory /> "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received," B<U+00E9>la said.<ref name=herald>{{cite article | title=Special Leadership Camps Held at Pico Blanco | author = Helene H. Parsons | publisher = Monterey Peninsula Herald | date = 1977-09-04}}</ref> 

As part of his master's degree program in counseling psychology at [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]], he wrote a thesis titled "A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting"<ref name="a_design">{{cite book |title = A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting |author = B<U+00E9>la B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy |publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council |date = 1963 }}</ref>. This book described the founding principles of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program| White Stag program]], which was later adapted by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America.<ref name="woodbadge">{{cite book

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy |date =  1964 |Publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council, Boy Scouts of America }}</ref>  Prior to B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy's work, adult [[Wood Badge]] and the [[National Youth Leadership Training | junior leader training]] programs had focused on teaching [[Scoutcraft]] skills. His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs, shifting their focus to leadership skills. The leadership competencies he articulated became the ''de facto'' method for Scout adult and junior leader training.<ref>{{cite book|title=Troop Leader Development Staff Guide |publisher=Boy Scouts of America|date=1974|pages=94-95}}</ref> (In 2008, the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary.) 

In the 1970s, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and participated in three Interamerican Train the Trainer events in Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], and [[Venezuela]]. He guided their national training teams in designing leadership development by design programs. B<U+00E9>la also taught in [[Sunday School]] and was on the Board of the [http://www.churchofthewayfarer.com/ Church of the Wayfarer] in [[Carmel, California]].

=== Systems science===
In the 1960s B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy began teaching courses in applied linguistics and systems science at [[San Jos<U+00E9> State University]]. In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master degree in [[psychology]] at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a doctorate in [[education]] for a trans-disciplinary program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was named Chair of Western Division of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]]. He published his first book, ''Instructional Systems,'' in 1968.

=== Large complex systems===
During the 1960s and 1970s, B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley and continued teaching San Jose State University. In 1969, he left the re-named Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director, and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director at the Far West Laboratory for Research and Development (now WestEd<ref>[http://www.wested.org WestEd]</ref>) in Berkeley (later moved to San Francisco). He "directed over fifty research and development programs, designed many curriculum projects and several large scale complex systems, including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]."<ref name=belabio /> Due to the success of his leadership development program, the Scout programs of Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela invited him to introduce it to their countries.<ref name=jenink />

In the 1970s and 1980s, he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems. In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in  humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the [[Saybrook Graduate School]].

=== International Systems Institute ===
In 1981, he founded the International Systems Institute<ref name="ISI"/> (ISI), a non-profit, public benefit scientific and educational corporation in [[Carmel, California]], USA. He organized its first meeting at Fuschl Am See, Austria in 1982.<ref name=isistory />

What was truly revolutionary about the International Systems Institute was Banathy's method for organizing conferences. Banathy observed that in traditional conferences, a few usually well-respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present "pre-packaged new ideas" to others. In typical conferences, presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening; the few present and share their wisdom with the many. This one-to-many or "hierarchical knowledge distribution system" slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about which many people cared deeply if not passionately, as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants. This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule in the form of informal, spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed. <ref name=isistory>{{cite web | title=The ISI Story |url=http://www.systemsinstitute.com/dnn/AboutISI/TheISIStory/tabid/159/Default.aspx|date=1995|accessdate=2008-09-15|author=Tad Frantz}}</ref>

The notion that presenting is more important than listening aroused life-long antipathy in B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy. When he formulated the leadership competencies of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] in the 1960s, he described the passing of knowledge from one to another as "Manager of Learning." He wrote extensively about how the focus should be on the learner, not the teacher.<ref name="a_report">{{cite book

|date = 1964
}}</ref>

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy advanced a different vision for conferences, one that would allow everyone to fully engage. He proposed that everyone be given the opportunity to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference. And instead of listening to speeches, conference attendees took part in extended, non-hierarchical conversations about the conference papers. The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations.  B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations so they might put their expertise "actively into the service of humanity worldwide." <ref name=isistory />

B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy wrote, "We aspire to reap the 'reflecting and creating power' of groups that emerge in the course of disciplined and focused conversations on issues that are important to us and to our society." Participants at International Systems Institute gatherings have since the original meeting organized by B<U+00E1>n<U+00E1>thy in 1982 organized them around this principle and referred to them as "conversations."<ref name=isistory />

=== General Evolutionary Research Group===
In 1984, he was co-founder with general evolution  theorist [[Ervin L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>]] and others of the initially secret  General Evolutionary Research Group<ref name="GERG" /><ref name=belabio>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedarwinproject.com/gerg/gerg.html | title=The General Evolution Research Group|accessdate=2009-09-09}}</ref>  A member of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society of General Systems Research]] since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president.<ref name=isistory /> He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the '80s, he served on the Executive Committee of the [[International Federation of Systems Research]].<ref name=belabio /> In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual International Systems Institute international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.<ref name=jenink />

He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries, including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design<ref>[http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 Fuschl Conversation on Systems Design]</ref> conversation held at Fuschl Am See, Austria, sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research. He was also honorary editor of three international systems journals: [[Systems Research and Behavioral Science]], the Journal of Applied Systems Studies<ref>[http://www.unipi.gr/jass/  Journal of Applied Systems Studies]</ref>, and [[Systems]]. He was on the Board of Editors of World Futures<ref>[http://www.wfsf.org/ World Futures]</ref>, and served as a contributing editor of [[Educational Technology]].
