'''People's Republic of China-Israel relations''' refers to bilateral relations between the State of [[Israel]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Ties were formally established in 1992.

==Background==
Ties between the People's Republic of China and Israel were virtually non-existent owing to China's support for the nations of the [[Muslim world]] who opposed the creation of Israel and the [[partition of Palestine]] in 1948; it chose to recognize the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|State of Palestine]] as proclaimed by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO). Until the 1980s, China refused to grant [[visa (document)|visa]]s to Israelis unless they held [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] and carried a passport of a country other than Israel.<ref name="E">{{cite web |title=Israel and China quietly form trade bonds |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&res=9B02E4DF1339F931A15754C0A963948260&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss |date=1985-07-22 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>

China and Israel secretly began building ties, especially military cooperation in the 1980s.<ref name="E"/> In the 1980s, China and Israel began exchanging visits of delegations of academicians, experts and businessmen and industrialists.<ref name="E"/> China eased travel restrictions while Israel reopened its [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] in [[Hong Kong]] (then under British administration), which would serve as the main point for diplomatic and economic contacts between the two nations.<ref name="E"/> In the early 1990s, China joined a number of nations who established ties with Israel after the initiation of a peace process between Israel and the PLO in the early 1990s; it also desired to play a role in the peace process.

==Development of bilateral relations==
In November 1991, the [[Defense Minister of Israel]] [[Moshe Arens]] was reported to have paid a secret visit to China and believed to have negotiated the establishment of ties and expansion of military cooperation. On January 23, 1992 the [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|Foreign Minister of Israel]] [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]] paid a four-day visit to [[Beijing]], preceding the formal establishment of ties. Both nations had maintained some trade links, which stood at [[United States dollar|USD]] 30 million in 1992. Since then, the annual growth in trade has averaged 40%.<ref name="D">{{cite web |title=China No 1 in Israeli Asian Trade |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-11/09/content_729027.htm |date=2000-11-09 |publisher=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Bilateral trade rose to USD 3 billion in 2005 and is projected to rise to USD 5 billion by 2008 and USD 10 billion by 2010.<ref name="D"/><ref name="J">{{cite web |title=Scandals follow Olmert to China |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1167467702533 |date=2007-01-10 |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> China is Israel's largest Asian trading partner<ref name="D"/> and has sought Israel's expertise in solar energy, manufacturing robotics, irrigation, construction, agricultural and water management and [[desalination]] technologies to combat [[drought]] and water shortages.<ref name="E"/><ref name="C">{{cite web |title=Israel-China "water-trade" to rise significantly |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1192380707655 |date=2000-11-01 |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> In turn, Israel has imported high-tech products and manufactured goods from China.
