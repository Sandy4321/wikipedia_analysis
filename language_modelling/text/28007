'''Michael Haneke''' (born March 23, 1942) is an Austrian [[film director|filmmaker]] and [[screenwriter|writer]] best known for his bleak and disturbing style. His films often document problems and failures in modern society. Haneke has worked in [[television]]<U+201A> [[theatre]] and [[Film|cinema]]. He is also known for raising social issues in his work.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Minister of Fear. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/magazine/23haneke-t.html |quote=Making waves, however, is what Haneke has become famous for. Over the last two decades, the director has developed a reputation for stark, often brutal films that place the viewer <U+2014> sometimes subtly, sometimes explicitly <U+2014> in the uncomfortable role of accomplice to the crimes playing out on-screen. This approach has made Haneke one of contemporary cinema<U+2019>s most reviled and revered figures, earning him everything from accusations of obscenity to a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. ''Funny Games'', the movie Haneke was shooting in New York and Long Island, is the American remake of a highly controversial film by the same name that he directed in 1997. |publisher=[[New York Times Magazine]] |date=September 23, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-21 }}</ref> Besides working as filmmaker he also teaches directing at the [[Filmacademy Vienna]]. 

At the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], his film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] for best film.

He has made films in French, German and English.

==Life and career==
Haneke was born in [[Munich]], Germany, the son of actor and director [[Fritz Haneke]] and actress [[Beatrix von Degenschild]]. Haneke was raised in the city [[Wiener Neustadt]]. He attended the [[University of Vienna]] to study [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[drama]] after failing to achieve success in his early attempts in acting and music. After graduating, he became a film critic and from 1967 to 1970 he worked as editor and dramaturg at the southwestern German television station [[S<U+00FC>dwestfunk]].  He made his debut as a television director in 1974. 

Haneke's feature film debut was 1989's ''[[The Seventh Continent]]'', which served to trace out the violent and bold style that would bloom in later years. Three years later, the controversial ''[[Benny's Video]]'' put Haneke's name on the map. Haneke's greatest success came in 2001 with his most critically successful film, the French ''[[The Piano Teacher]]''. It won the prestigious [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prize]] at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]] and also won its stars, [[Beno<U+00EE>t Magimel]] and [[Isabelle Huppert]], the Best Actor and Actress awards. He has worked with [[Juliette Binoche]] (''[[Code Unknown]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Cach<U+00E9> (film)|Cach<U+00E9>]]'' in 2005), after she expressed interest in working with him.<ref>http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/review/2097/</ref> Another actress Haneke frequently enjoys working with is [[Susanne Lothar]].

His latest film, ''[[The White Ribbon]]'', premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The movie is set in 1913 and deals with strange incidents in a small town in Northern Germany, depicting an authoritarian, fascist-like atmosphere, where children are subjected to rigid rules and suffer harsh punishments, and where strange deaths occur. The Cannes jury presided by Isabelle Huppert and including [[Asia Argento]], [[Hanif Kureishi]] and [[Robin Wright Penn]] awarded Haneke's film the Palme d'Or for the best feature film.

===Stage work===
As a playwright, he directed a number of stage productions in German, which included works by [[Strindberg]], [[Goethe]], and [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in Berlin, [[Munich]] and [[Vienna]]. In 2006, Haneke gave his debut as an opera director, staging [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' for the [[Op<U+00E9>ra National de Paris]] at [[Palais Garnier]], when the theater's general manager was [[G<U+00E9>rard Mortier]]. In 2012 he was to direct ''[[Cos<U+00EC> fan tutte]]'' for the [[New York City Opera]].<ref>[http://www.metoperafamily.org/operanews/news/pressrelease.aspx?id=1508 Opera News > The Met Opera Guild<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This production had originally been commissioned by [[J<U+00FC>rgen Flimm]] for the [[Salzburg Festival]] 2009, but Haneke had to resign due to an illness preventing him from preparing the work. Haneke is now scheduled to realize the production at [[Madrid]]'s [[Teatro Real]] in 2012, which then will be managed by Mortier.<ref>http://oe1.orf.at/inforadio/105557.html?filter=5</ref>

== Quotes ==
:"My films are intended as polemical statements against the American 'barrel down' cinema and its dis-empowerment of the spectator. They are an appeal for a cinema of insistent questions instead of false (because too quick) answers, for clarifying distance in place of violating closeness, for provocation and dialogue instead of consumption and consensus."
::-- From "Film as catharsis''".<ref>Haneke, Michael - ''Film als Katharsis'': in ''Austria (in)felix: zum <U+00F6>sterreichischem Film der 80er Jahre'' - Bono, Francesco (ed.), 1992. ISBN 3901272003</ref>

:"Pornography, it seems to me, is no different from war films or propaganda films in that it tries to make the visceral, horrific, or transgressive elements of life consumable."<ref>http://www.kinoeye.org/04/01/interview01.php</ref>

:"Film is 24 lies per second at the service of truth, or at the service of the attempt to find the truth."
: "My favourite film-maker of the decade is [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. He achieves a simplicity that<U+2019>s so difficult to attain." <ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6905956.ece]</ref>
