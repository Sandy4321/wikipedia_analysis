'''Julien Michel Leiris''' ([[April 20]] [[1901]] in [[Paris]] &ndash; [[September 30]] [[1990]] in Saint-Hilaire, [[Essonne]]) was a [[France|French]] [[surrealist]] writer and [[ethnographer]].

==Biography==
Michel Leiris obtained his ''baccalaur<U+00E9>at'' in philosophy in 1918 and after a brief attempt at studying chemistry, he developed a strong interest in jazz and poetry. Between 1921 and 1924, Leiris met a number of important figures such as [[Max Jacob]], [[Georges Henri Rivi<U+00E8>re]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Robert Desnos]], [[Georges Bataille]] and the artist [[Andr<U+00E9> Masson]], who soon became his mentor. Through Masson, Leiris became a member of the [[Surrealist]] movement, contributed to ''[[La R<U+00E9>volution surr<U+00E9>aliste]]'' and published ''Simulacre'' (1925), and ''Le Point Cardinal'' (1927). In 1926, he married Louise Godon, the step-daughter of [[Picasso]]<U+2019>s dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] and traveled to Egypt and Greece.

Following a fall out with [[Andr<U+00E9> Breton]] in 1929, he joined Bataille<U+2019>s team as a sub-editor for ''[[Documents (journal)|Documents]]'', to which he also regularly contributed articles such as <U+201C>Notes on Two Microcosmic Figures of the 14th and 15th Centuries<U+201D> (1929, issue 1), <U+201C>In Connection with the <U+2018>Mus<U+00E9>e des Sorciers" (1929, issue 2), "Civilisation"  (1929, issue 4), <U+201C>The <U+2018>Caput Mortuum<U+2019> or the Alchemist<U+2019>s Wife<U+201D> (1930, issue 8),  and on artists such as [[Giacometti]], [[Mir<U+00F3>]], [[Picasso]], and the 16th Century painter, [[Antoine Caron]]. He also  wrote an article on <U+201C>The  Ethnographer<U+2019>s Eye (concerning the [[Dakar-Djibouti mission]])<U+201D> before setting off in 1930 as the secretary-archivist in [[Marcel Griaule|Marcel Griaule's]] ambitious ethnographic expedition. From this experience, Leiris published his first important book in 1934, ''L<U+2019>Afrique fant<U+00F4>me'', combining both an ethnographic study and an autobiographical project, which broke with the traditional ethnographic writing style of Griaule. Upon his return, he started his practice as an ethnographer at the [[Mus<U+00E9>e de l<U+2019>Homme]], a position he kept until 1971.

In 1937, Leiris teamed up with Bataille and [[Roger Caillois]] to found the [[College of Sociology|Coll<U+00E8>ge de sociologie]] in response to the current international situation. Increasingly involved in politics, he took part  in an important mission to the Ivory Coast in 1945, whose report led to the suppression of slavery in [[French colonies]]. As a member of [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Jean-Paul Sartre's]] editorial committee for ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', Leiris was involved in a series of political struggles, including the [[Algerian War]], and was one of the first to sign the [[<U+2018>D<U+00E9>claration sur le droit <U+00E0> l<U+2019>insoumission dans la guerre d<U+2019>Alg<U+00E9>rie<U+2019>]], the 1960 manifesto supporting the  fight against the colonial powers in Algeria.

In 1961, Leiris was made head of research in ethnography at the C.N.R.S. ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]) and published numerous critical texts on artists he admired, including [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], with whom he had become close friends. Considered a  leading figure in 20th century French literature, Michel Leiris left a considerable amount of works, as diverse as they are numerous, from autobiographical works such as ''L<U+2019>Age  d<U+2019>homme'' (1939), ''La R<U+00E8>gle du jeu'' (1948-1976) and his ''Journal 1922-1989'' (published postmortem in 1992); art criticism such as ''Au verso des images'' (1980) or ''Francis Bacon face et profil'' (1983); music criticism such as ''Operratiques'' (1992 ); and scientific contributions such as ''La Langue secr<U+00E8>te des Dogons de Saga'' (1948) and ''Race et civilisation'' (1951). (His fields of interest in anthropology ranged from [[bullfighting]] to [[possession]] in [[Gondar]], [[Ethiopia]].)

Leiris was also a talented poet, and poetry was important in his approach to the world. In the preface to *''Haut Mal, suivi de Autres Lancers'' (Gallimard 1969) he is quoted as saying that "the practice of poetry enables us to posit the Other as an equal" and that poetic inspiration is, "a very rare thing, a fleeting gift from Heaven, to which the poet needs to be, at the price of an absolute purity, receptive - and to pay with his unhappiness for the benefits derived from this blessing."
