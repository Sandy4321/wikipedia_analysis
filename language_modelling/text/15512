'''Alvin D. Kersh''' is a [[fictional character]] on the American [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]'', portrayed by [[James Pickens, Jr.]]. He serves as a figure of authority within the series, first introduced as an [[Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation#Organization_and_rank_structure|assistant director]] of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and is later promoted to the post of [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|deputy director]]. Kersh acts as an antagonist who bureaucratically prevents special agents [[Fox Mulder]], [[Dana Scully]], [[John Doggett]] and [[Monica Reyes]] from investigating cases dealing with the paranormal, dubbed [[X-File]]s.

Kersh first appeared as a guest role in several episodes of the series' [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]], returning as a recurring character in the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth]] and [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth]] seasons. Kersh's creation was driven by a need to place pressure on the character of [[Walter Skinner]]. The character has been met with mixed to negative critical responses, initially received positively before coming to be considered a "one-note" role as the series progressed. Pickens, as part of the series' ensemble cast, earned [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] nomination for his work.

== Character arc ==

Kersh's first appearance in the series was during the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] opening episode "[[The Beginning (The X-Files)|The Beginning]]". As an Assistant Director, he temporarily became supervisor to Agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) when they were assigned away from the X-Files division.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Beginning (The X-Files) | title=The Beginning | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) |airdate= November 8, 1998 | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 6  | number = 1}}</ref> During this time  [[The Smoking Man]] could be seen in his office, reminiscent of his silent presence in [[Walter Skinner]]'s office in early seasons.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Triangle (The X-Files) | title=Triangle | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer & director) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 6  | number = 3 |airdate=November 22, 1998}}</ref> Kersh assigned Mulder and Scully mostly to menial tasks, such as terrorist details and Federal background checks. When they did investigate an X-File behind his back, Kersh would charge them for expenses they incurred on the case, forcing them to pay out of their own pocket.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Drive (The X-Files) | title=Drive | series=[[The X-Files]] |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] (writer) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 6  | number = 2 |airdate=November 15, 1998}}</ref> He also attempted to separate Mulder and Scully, believing that Mulder threw away a promising career as a [[Offender profiling|criminal profiler]], but that Scully's career could still be saved.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink= Tithonus (The X-Files) | title=Tithonus | series=The X-Files | serieslink= The X-Files |credits =[[Michael Watkins]] (director); [[Vince Gilligan]] (writer) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 6  | number = 10 |airdate=January 24, 1999}}</ref>

When Mulder and Scully were reassigned to the X-Files office, Kersh continued to climb the ladder, culminating in an assignment as [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. It was not long after his promotion that Mulder was [[Abduction phenomenon|abducted by aliens]]. At the beginning of the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]], Kersh assigned [[John Doggett]] ([[Robert Patrick]]) to run the [[Manhunt (military)|manhunt]] for Mulder.<ref name="Within"/> When the manhunt failed, Doggett was assigned to the X-files with Scully, until Mulder was found in "[[This Is Not Happening]]". When Mulder returned, Kersh refused to assign him to the X-Files, keeping Doggett in that position.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Deadalive | title=Deadalive | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Tony Wharmby]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] (writers) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 8  | number = 15 |airdate=April 1, 2001}}</ref> When Mulder and Doggett pursued an unauthorized case, Kersh was prepared to fire them both, but Mulder accepted full responsibility and was dismissed from the FBI.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Vienen | title=Vienen | series=[[The X-Files]] |credits =Rod Hardy (director); [[Steven Maeda]] (writer) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 8  | number = 18 |airdate=April 29, 2001}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, Mulder disappeared again. After Doggett saw Kersh in a late night meeting with two conspirators, Knowle Rohrer and Gene Crane, Doggett brought in [[Monica Reyes]] ([[Annabeth Gish]]) to help him investigate Kersh's involvement in Mulder's disappearance. The investigation turned up nothing. Although Doggett seemed convinced that Kersh was involved in the conspiracy, Kersh insisted that he was actually protecting Mulder.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Existence (The X-Files) | title=Existence | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer); [[Kim Manners]] (director) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 8 | number = 21 |airdate=May 20, 2001}}</ref>

During the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], the [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Toothpick Man|Toothpick Man]] ([[Alan Dale]]), a key conspirator, could be seen in the company of Kersh, much like The Smoking Man before. In the end, Kersh showed a heroic side during the series finale "[[The Truth (The X-Files)|The Truth]]", when he helped Doggett and Skinner free Mulder from a military prison. Following this, Kersh had to permanently close the X-Files to appease his irate superiors.<ref name="The_Truth">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Truth (The X-Files) | title=The Truth | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 9  | number = 19 & 20|airdate=May 12, 2002}}</ref>

== Conceptual history ==

The character was named after Dr. Kersh and Anton Kersh, characters from ''[[Vampire Circus]]''<U+2014>a favourite film of series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. According to writer and producer [[Frank Spotnitz]], the creation of the Kersh character was due to the writers desiring to create another of the several characters in the series who put pressure on Walter Skinner.<ref name="Deadalivecomm"/>

When reflecting on the casting of [[James Pickens, Jr.]], Spotnitz called him "another great find", adding that "so many times over the course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with [[William B. Davis]] as the [[Cigarette-Smoking Man]] and with [[Nicholas Lea|Nick Lea]] as Krycek, and with [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part".<ref name="Deadalivecomm">{{cite video |people=[[Frank Spotnitz]] |date=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for "Deadalive" |medium= DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=[[The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 <U+2013> Super Soldiers]]}}</ref> Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly been watching ''[[The X-Files]]''{{'}} sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when<U+2014>in the final moments of "[[One Son]]"<U+2014>Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Frank Spotnitz]] |date=2005 |title=Audio Commentary for "One Son" |medium= DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=[[The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 <U+2013> Colonization]]}}</ref>

Pickens prepared for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was that most of the people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason.<ref>Meisler, pp. 10<U+2013>18.</ref> Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were "both military men <U+2013> Air Force, Marines".<ref name="withincomm"/> Kersh was depicted as a [[United States Navy]] [[A-6 Intruder]] weapons officer during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name="Within">{{cite episode| episodelink= Within (The X-Files) | title=Within | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] (director); [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (writer) | network = Fox Broadcasting Company | season = 8 | number = 1 |airdate=November 5, 2000}}</ref> Both Patrick and director [[Kim Manners]] thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would "come in each week and just nail his stuff" regardless of what else was going on.<ref name="withincomm">{{cite video |people=[[Kim Manners]]; [[Robert Patrick]] |date=2003 |title=Audio Commentary for "Within" |medium= DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox Home Entertainment |location=[[The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 <U+2013> Colonization]]}}</ref> Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show."<ref name="Deadalivecomm"/>

== Reception ==

Michael Avalos, writing for the ''[[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder Tribune]]'', felt positively about the introduction of Kersh, saying he harbored "almost fond memories" of the former recurring character, Section Chief [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Scott Blevins|Scott Blevins]], played by [[Charles Cioffi]].<ref>{{cite news | title=X-Cursions: This episode gave everyone a headache. | author = Avalos, Michael | work=[[Knight Ridder|Knight Ridder Tribune]] | date= November 19, 1998 | accessdate=October 23, 2009 }}</ref> George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' reacted positive towards James Pickens, Jr.'s performance in the eighth season's "[[Via Negativa (The X-Files)|Via Negativa]]", saying the story "clicked" thanks to Kersh and Walter Skinner.<ref>{{cite news | title=Movie Review: ''The X-Files'' Will Satisfy Series fans / Movie Version of TV Series Packed With Paranoia, Plot Twists, Romantic Tension |author=Andersen, Soren |date=June 19, 1998 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |work=[[Contra Costa Times]]}}</ref> ''[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]]'' writer Aaron Kinner when writing a review for the ninth season, noted that he was the first black character since [[X (The X-Files)|X]]'s introduction in [[The X-Files (season 4)|season four]], while not positive towards the character's development during the ninth season and the season overall.<ref>{{cite news | author=Kinney, Aaron | url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/tv/feature/2002/05/17/x_files/index.html | title=The truth is, um, where, exactly? | publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|''Salon'']] | date=May 17, 2002 | accessdate=October 23, 2009 }}</ref> 

Writing for ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' about the character's introduction, Paul Vitaris called Pickens "a fine addition to the cast" of the series, describing his portrayal of Kersh as "a strong presence".<ref name="cine1">{{cite journal |last=Vitaris |first=Paula |year=1999 |month=October |title=Series creator Chris Carter on tying up the loose ends for the show's final season |journal=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=31  |issue=8 |page=26 }}</ref> However, during a review of the eighth season two years later, Vitaris described Kersh as "one of the most one-note characters yet" on the series.<ref name="cine1">{{cite journal |last=Vitaris |first=Paula |year= 2002 |month=April  |title=Series creator Chris Carter on tying up the loose ends for the show's final season |journal=[[Cinefantastique]] |volume=34  |issue=2 |page=42 }}</ref> [[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen'', describe Kersh's return in the eighth season as "contrived but forgivable".<ref>Shearman and Pearson, p. 229</ref> Shearman and Pearson noted that the character is "an effective obstruction to any number of X-Files cases, but he can hardly be considered a lead villain".<ref>Shearman and Pearson, p. 260</ref>

In 1999, Pickens was nominated for a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series|Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]] for his work as Kersh, alongside Gillian Anderson, William B.
