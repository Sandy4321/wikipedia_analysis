'''Trailblazer''' is a [[Family roller coaster|family]] [[roller coaster]] at the famous [[Hersheypark]] [[amusement park]] in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania|Hershey]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The ride is notable for being the second-oldest operating coaster in the park, after the [[Comet (Hersheypark)|Comet]], and for it's family-friendly height requirement of 36 inches and above with an adult.

The coaster reaches speeds of up to 45 mph, and features a helix that circles 4 times. The mid-course brake zone is nearly level with [[Storm Runner (Hersheypark)|Storm Runner]], and the queue for that ride extends inside Trailblazer's first drop.

==Trivia==
{{Trivia}}
* According to a 1974 Souvenir book printed before the coaster was finalized, the ride was supposed to feature two lifts. <ref>Hershey's Guidebook, Western Publishing Company, 1974.</ref>
* The ride received two new trains in [[2003]] built by [[Premier Rides]]. The main difference is the new cars had individual lap bars for each seat, rather than the single "t-bar" lap bars for each pair of seats.
