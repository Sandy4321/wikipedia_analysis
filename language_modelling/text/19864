'''Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo''' (4 March 1901 or 1903&nbsp;<U+2013> 22 June 1937), born '''Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo''', is widely considered to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of [[Madagascar]]. Part of the first generation raised under [[French Madagascar|French colonization]], Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and [[ohabolana|traditional Malagasy poetry]] prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary revues, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]], as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.

Rabearivelo's early period of [[modernist poetry|modernist]]-inspired poetry showed skill and attracted critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The [[surrealism|surrealist]] poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry revues, Rabearivelo was never afforded access to the elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including the death of his daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Universal Exposition]] in [[Paris]], and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.

The death of Rabearivelo occurred just prior to the emergence of the ''[[N<U+00E9>gritude]]'' movement, by which time the Malagasy poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as [[L<U+00E9>opold S<U+00E9>dar Senghor]] as Africa's first modern poet. The Government of Madagascar declared Rabearivelo its national poet upon independence in 1960. The legacy and influence of his works continue to be felt and his works are a focus of ongoing academic study. Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including [[Elie Rajaonarison]] have cited him as a major inspiration. A street and a high school in [[Antananarivo]] have been named after him, as well as a dedicated room in the [[National Library of Madagascar]].

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, born Joseph-Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in [[Ambatofotsy]] (north of [[Antananarivo]]), [[Madagascar]], was the only child of an unwed mother descended from the ''Zanadralambo'' ("sons of [[Ralambo]]") caste of the [[Merina people|Merina]] ''[[andriana]]'' (nobles).<ref name = CUNY/><ref name = Bellepierre/> When the French [[French Madagascar|colonized Madagascar]] in 1897, Merina nobles including Rabearivelo's mother lost the privileges, prestige, and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy, the [[Kingdom of Imerina]].<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born, situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the [[French colonial empire|colonial system]].<ref name = Bellepierre/> He first studied at the Fr<U+00E8>res des <U+00C9>coles Chr<U+00E9>tiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo,<ref name = CUNY/> then transferred to the prestigious Coll<U+00E8>ge Saint-Michel, where he was expelled for lack of discipline, poor academic performance,<ref name = Bellepierre/> and his reluctance to become religiously observant.{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=ix}} He ended his studies at <U+00C9>cole Flacourt in 1915.<ref name = CUNY/> He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review ''Vakio Ity'' under the [[pen name]] K. Verbal.<ref name = Bellepierre/>

After leaving school, he worked a variety of low-skilled jobs, including as a lace designer,<ref name = CUNY/> an errand boy, and a secretary and interpreter to a district administrator.<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> During this period he developed a passion for [[19th-century French literature|French 19th]] and [[20th-century French literature|20th century literature]] and refined his fluency in the French language; he also began teaching himself English, Spanish, and Hebrew.<ref name = CUNY/> He changed his name to Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo to have the same initials as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], while continuing to occasionally use pseudonyms, including "Amance Valmond" and "Jean Osm<U+00E9>".<ref name = Bellepierre/> He was particularly attracted to poets and writers who were outcasts in their own society, including [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]].<ref name = JeuneAfrique/>

===Early period===
In 1920, Rabearivelo was hired as an assistant librarian<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> at the ''Cercle de l'Union'' [[Social clubs|social club]].<ref name = CUNY/> That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the [[Malagasy language]].<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> He began to correspond with a wide range of writers around the world, including [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]], [[Paul Val<U+00E9>ry]], [[Jean Amrouche]],<ref name = Bellepierre/> [[Paul Claudel]], and [[Valery Larbaud]],<ref name = francophonie/> and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar.<ref name = CUNY/> By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a [[proofreading|proofreader]] at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life.<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine ''18<U+00B0> Latitude Sud''.<ref name = Bellepierre/>

He published his first collection of poems, ''La coupe de cendres'' ("The Cup of Ashes") in 1924; the same year he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including ''18<U+00B0> Latitude Sud'' in Antananarivo and ''La Vie'' in Paris.<ref name = CUNY/> This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society, where he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.<ref name = Bellepierre/>

In 1925 he published a [[historical novel]] called ''L'Aube Rouge'' ("The Red Dawn") about the last years of the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he honored Rainandriamampandry, the governor of [[Toamasina]] who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the [[Menalamba rebellion]]. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, ''Sylves'' ("Woodlands") and ''Volumes'', in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, ''L'interf<U+00E9>rence'' ("Interference"), which depicts the life of a noble family from the last years of the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, [[Jules Laforgue|Laforgue]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], and [[Luis de G<U+00F3>ngora|G<U+00F3>ngora]]; he also translated traditional Malagasy ''[[hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]'' (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.<ref name = CUNY/>

In 1926, Rabearivelo married Mary Razafitrimo, the daughter of a local photographer,{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=ix}} and together they had five children.<ref name = CUNY/> He was also a womanizer and abused [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[opium addiction|opium]],<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> growing increasingly dependent on the substances after the death of his daughter.{{sfn|Fox|1990|p=71}} Rabearivelo constantly struggled with debt, and despite his growing fame and artistic success, he was unable to escape from poverty.<ref name = Bellepierre/>

===Late period===
Throughout the 1930s, Rabearivelo joined with other Malagasy poets and writers in an emerging literary movement termed ''"Hitady ny Very"'' ("The Search for Lost Values"), which sought to promote the traditional literary and oral arts of Madagascar. Together with fellow artists Charles Rajoelisolo and Ny Avana Ramanantoanina, in August 1931 he founded a literary journal called ''Ny Fandrosoam-baovao'' ("New Progress") to promote Malagasy-language poetry.<ref name = Bellepierre/> He published two more anthologies of thirty poems each: ''Presque-Songes'' ("Dream Images") (1931) and ''Traduit de la nuit'' ("Translated from the Night") (1932). As an experiment, he wrote Malagasy and French versions of each poem in these two books; the French versions were published in 1934 and 1935 respectively. For the remainder of his life he focused primarily on the translation of ''[[hainteny]]'' (traditional Malagasy poetry) into French, work which was published posthumously.<ref name = CUNY/> He also wrote Madagascar's first and only opera, ''Imaitsoanala'' (1935), named for the legendary heroine mother of King [[Ralambo]]; it was set to music composed by [[Andrianary Ratianarivo]] and was performed by Ratianarivo's Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo.{{sfn|Ranaivoson|2004|p=67}}

In 1933, his three-year-old daughter Voahangy became ill and died.{{sfn|Fox|1990|p=71}} Rabearivelo was deeply affected by this loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered. His last daughter, who was born in 1936, he named Velomboahangy ("Voahangy Alive"). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.<ref name = Bellepierre/>

The colonial high society of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo's work as evidence of the success of the [[Assimilation (French colonial)|French assimilation policy]] and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt "used" by the French authorities in Madagascar.<ref name = Bellepierre/> Governor Montagn<U+00E9> awarded him an affiliation (''membre correspondant'') with the ''[[Acad<U+00E9>mie Malgache]]'' in 1932. But in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo's colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration.<ref name = CUNY/> He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 Universal Exposition]] in [[Paris]], but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island's delegation.<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture.<ref name = CUNY/>

Rabearivelo was deeply troubled by these disappointments and his worsening chronic financial troubles,<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> in addition to the continuing grief he felt for the death of his daughter.<ref name = Bellepierre/> On 19 June 1937, a French friend informed him that his hope to eventually earn a higher official role within the administrative authority could never materialize as he was largely self-taught and lacked the required diplomas. Having staked his future on a government career, Rabearivelo began to muse about his own death in his journal, writing "Perhaps one needs to die to be found sincere."<ref name = JeuneAfrique/>

===Death===
Rabearivelo committed suicide by [[cyanide poisoning]] on the afternoon of 22 June 1937.<ref name = CUNY/> He may have been seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] at the time.{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=x}} The morning of his suicide, Rabearivelo completed several unfinished works; he then took fourteen 250-milligram [[quinine]] capsules with water at 1:53 pm, followed at 2:37 pm by ten grams of [[potassium cyanide]].<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> Before dying he wrote a final poem and burned the first five volumes of his personal journal,<ref name = Bellepierre/> the ''Calepins Bleus'' ("Blue Notebooks", 1924<U+2013>1937), leaving four volumes of approximately 1,800 pages that document his life after 4 January 1933.<ref name = CUNY/> In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide, concluding with his final entry at 3:02 pm.<ref name = JeuneAfrique/> At the time of his death, only half of his twenty literary works had been published; the remainder were printed posthumously.{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=ix}}

==Style and influences==
{{Quote box | quote  = With remarkable originality, [Rabearivelo] synthesized Europe's prevailing urban surrealism with his own comparatively bucolic surroundings. In Rabearivelo we are offered&nbsp;... the wildly innovative imagery of modern realism, permeated with the essence of traditional oral poetry. When reading Rabearivelo, unlike many other Surrealist-influenced modern poets, we never feel that we've been given a superfluous display of linguistic dexterity devoid of meaning&nbsp;... Here, we know, there is something of relevance being poetically manifested by a man isolated on an island, who wishes to communicate his thoughts to the rest of the world. His poems are often deceptively simple, uniquely surreal yet logical, both sensual and abstract&nbsp;<U+2014> yet they always bear the distinction of being infused with undeniable sincerity. | source = <U+2014> Robert Ziller, ''Translated from the Night''{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=x}} | width  = 40em | align = right}}
Rabearivelo's first poetic work, ''La coupe de cendres'' (1924), demonstrates the evident mastery of [[meter (poetry)|meter]] and [[rhythm]] in his earliest works, despite an absence of innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses. The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases,<ref name = CUNY/> the first being highly influenced by the [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]{{sfn|Rabearivelo|2007|p=x}} and [[romantic poetry|romantic]] schools of poetry, and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression, and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a "mythic past" with an "alienating modernity".<ref name = CUNY/>

In the romantic period, typified by ''Sylves'' (1927) and ''Volumes'' (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of traditional models. He identified himself and his work as post-symbolist in the early part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor [[Jacques Rabemananjara]] acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.<ref name = CUNY/>

Beginning in 1931, his works begin to change in tone<ref name = CUNY/> and show the influences of [[surrealism]]<ref name = Bellepierre/> and [[modernist poetry|modernism]].<ref name = CUNY/> His poems become more daring, free, and complex,<ref name = Bellepierre/> while also reflecting greater doubt.<ref name = CUNY/> According to academic Arnaud Sabatier, this change reflects "the rediscovery and embrace of the sound and images of traditional Malagasy poetry, from which he had previously distanced himself or which he had subjected to the colonial language and culture."<ref name = Bellepierre/> These later works are described by academic Claire Riffard as "his strangest, evoking rural and commonplace images alongside unexpected dreamlike visions, superimposing the new and the forgotten&nbsp;..." His break from convention in this period offered greater freedom to reconcile his conflicted identity, such as through his bilingual creations, ''Presque-Songes'' (1931) and ''Traduit de la nuit'' (1932).<ref name = CUNY/>
