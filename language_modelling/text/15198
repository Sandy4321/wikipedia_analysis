'''Sino-Soviet relations''' refers to the relationship between [[China]] and the various forms of [[Petrograd Soviet|Soviet Power]] which emerged from the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917 to 1991, when the [[Soviet Union]] ceased to exist.

==Russian Civil War and Mongolia==
The [[Beiyang government]] in north China joined the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]].  They sent forces in [[Siberian Intervention|Siberia]] and [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia]] beginning in 1918.

[[Mongolia]] and [[Tuva]] became contested territories. After being [[Occupation of Mongolia|occupied]] by the Chinese General [[Xu Shuzheng]] in 1919, and then by the [[White movement|Russian White Guard]] General turned independent warlord, [[Roman Ungern von Sternberg|Ungern von Sternberg]] in 1920, [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] with support of [[Mongols|Mongolian]] [[Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party|guerrillas]] led by [[Damdin S<U+00FC>khbaatar]], defeated the White warlord and established a new pro-Soviet Mongolian [[client state]], which by 1924 became the [[Mongolian People's Republic]].

==KMT, CCP, the Chinese Civil War and the establishment of diplomatic relations==
In 1921, the Soviet Union began supporting the [[Kuomintang]], and in 1923, the [[Comintern]] instructed the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] (commonly abbreviated as CCP) to sign a military treaty with the KMT. On May 31, 1924, the two governments signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations, while the Soviet government renounced in that agreement all privileges granted to the Tsarist government in China.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 37, pp. 176-191.</ref> But in 1926, KMT leader, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, after the [[Northern Expedition (1926<U+2013>1927)|Northern Expedition]] was concluded, Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the [[Chinese Civil War]] which was to last until 1950, a few months after the [[People's Republic of China]], led by [[Mao Zedong]], was proclaimed. During the war, some Soviet support was given to the CCP, who in 1934 were dealt a crushing blow when the KMT brought an end to the [[Jiangxi Soviet|Chinese Soviet Republic]], beginning the CCP's [[Long March]] from [[Shaanxi]].

==Sino-Soviet conflict, 1929==
{{main|Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)}}
The Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929 was a minor armed conflict between the Soviet Union and the Republic of China over the [[Manchuria]]n [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. The Chinese seized the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, swift Soviet military intervention quickly put an end to the crisis and forced the Chinese to accept restoration of joint Soviet-Chinese administration of the railway.

==Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang==
{{main|Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang}}
The Soviet Union [[Red Army]] and their White Russian allies were severely mauled by the Republic of China [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)]] which was composed of Muslims, when the Soviets attempted to seize Xinjiang.

==Xinjiang War (1937)==
{{main|Xinjiang War (1937)}}
The Soviet Union intervened again in Xinjiang in 1937.

==Second-Sino Japanese War and World War II==
[[Image:Wuhan-Soviet-Aviators-Tomb-0175.jpg|thumb|Monument to the [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet Volunteer Airmen]] who died in defense of China from Japanese invaders. The unit was based in Wuhan in 1938]]
In 1931, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] invaded [[Manchuria]] and created the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] (1932), which signaled the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In 1937, a month after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], the Soviet Union established a [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]] with the Republic of China. During the [[World War II]] period, the two countries suffered more losses than any other country, with China (in the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]]) losing over 30 million people and the Soviet Union 20 million.

==Joint victory over Imperial Japan==
On August 8, 1945, three months after [[Nazi Germany]] surrendered, and on the week of the [[United States|American]] [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], the Soviet Union launched the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], a massive military operation mobilizing 1.5 million soldiers against one million [[Kantogun|Kwantung Army]] troops, the last remaining [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] presence. Soviet forces won a decisive victory while the Kwantung suffered massive casualties, with 700,000 having surrendered. The Soviet Union distributed some of the weapons of the captured Kwantung Army to the CCP, who were still battling the KMT in the Chinese Civil War.

==Ili Rebellion==
{{main|Ili Rebellion}}
While the [[Republic of China]] was concentrating on the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], The [[USSR]] supported [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] nationalists in their uprise in [[Xinjiang]] and set up [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] against [[Kuomintang]]. Until [[Chinese Communist Party]] defeated Kuomintang in [[1949]], USSR terminated to support Second East Turkestan Republic.

The Soviets tried to spread anti Chinese propaganda among minorities in Xinjiang, but this backfired right back at them when Uyghur mobs attacked White Russians, and called for white Russians to be expelled from Xinjiang.<ref name="attempts">[http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1947v07/reference/frus.frus1947v07.i0008.pdf UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO RESEOLVE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN SINKIANG; EXTENT OF SOVIET AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO REBEL GROUPS IN SINKIANG; BORDER INCIDENT AT PEITASHAN]</ref>

==Pei-ta-shan Incident==
{{main|Pei-ta-shan Incident}}
Chinese Muslim forces fought against Soviet and Mongol troops in this incident.

==War of Liberation and the People's Republic of China==
Between 1946 and 1950, the CCP was increasingly enjoying massive support from the Chinese people in the "War of Liberation", effectively implementing a [[People's war]], while the KMT became increasingly isolated, only belatedly attempting to stem corruption and introduce popular reforms. On October 1, 1949 the People's Republic of China was proclaimed by Mao Zedong, and by May 1950 the Civil War was brought to an end in the [[Battle of Kuningtou]], which saw the KMT expelled from [[Mainland China]] but in control of [[Taiwan]]. With the creation of the People's Republic of China, the supreme political authority in the two countries became centred in two communist parties, both espousing revolutionary, [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology: the Communist Party of China and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a sensitive issue which influenced the Sino-Soviet relationship emeraged. As the condition of fighting with the  [[Kwantung Army]] in the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union got the use right of the [[China Far East Railway]], the [[South Manchuria Railway]], [[Lushun]] (also called as Port Arthur) and [[Dalian]]. These privileges were significantly important as the Asian strategies of the Soviet Union because the Port Arthur and Dalian were appropriate ice-free ports for the Soviet Navy, and the China Far East Railway and the South Manchuria Railway were the essential arterial communications which connected Siberia to the Port Arthur and Dalian. As [[Mao Zedong]] thought that the use right of China Far East Railway, the South Manchuria Railway, the Port Arthur and Dalian refers to Chinese state sovereignty, he required the Soviet Union to return these interests to China, and this was a crucial part of the  [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]]. [[Joseph Stalin]] initially refused this treaty, but finally made a great concession, and argeed with this treaty under the various stresses <ref name="ReferenceA">Text in Shen Zhihua, ''<U+4E2D><U+82CF><U+5173><U+7CFB><U+53F2><U+7EB2>'', <U+65B0><U+534E><U+51FA><U+7248><U+793E><U+FF0C>2007<U+5E74><U+FF0C><U+5317><U+4EAC></ref>. As this treaty, China acquired its state soverignty, but the interests of the Soviet Union suffered a heavy loss, so the signing of the  [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]] marked the moment that the relationship between China and the Soviet Union came to the worst. 

Since the  [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship]], the Soviet Union lost its naval bases in the Port Arthur and Dalian, the issue that Stalin had to face was to find a new ice-free port as the Soviet naval base. This issue ultimately became the reason that Stalin supported [[Kim Il-Sung]] to launch the [[Korean War]] <ref name="ReferenceA"/>. However, both [[Kim Il-Sung]] and Stalin did not consider that the United States would intervene into this war immediately, if at all. Kim Il-Sung could not sustain the attack from the US Army. When [[Kim Il-Sung]] required military assist from the Soviet Union and China, Mao did agree with sending Chinese troops, but asked Soviet Air Force to provide air cover. As the 2 leaders distrusted each other, Stalin agreed with sending Chinese troops to Korea, but refused to provide air cover<ref name="Shen Zhihua pp.211-230">Text in Shen Zhihua, ''China and the Dispatch of the Soviet Air Force: The Formation of the Chinese-Soviet-Korean Alliance in the Early Stage of the Korean War''The Journal of Strategic Studies, vol.33, no.2, pp.211-230</ref>. Since without the air cover from the Soviet Union, Mao once considered that China did not send troops into Korea, and Stalin at one time decided to give up the Korea Peninsula <ref name="Shen Zhihua pp.211-230"/>. After much cogitation, Mao solely sent Chinese troops into Korea on the 19th of October, 1950 under an extremely hard Chinese economical and military situation. This activity ultimately changed the Sino-Soviet relationship. After 12 days of Chinese troops entering the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aids to China <ref name="Shen Zhihua pp.211-230"/>. Mao sending Chinese troops to take part in the [[Korean War]] was followed by large-scale economical and military cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and from this, the friendly relationship of the two countries changed from titular to virtual.

In one less known example of the Sino-Soviet military cooperation, in April<U+2013>June 1952 a group of Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-4]] aircraft were based in Beijing to perform reconnaissance missions on American fusion bomb tests <ref>{{cite web| title = Pages from the diary of the retired Colonel Peter Vladimirovich Strunov | publisher = Airforce.ru. | url = http://www.airforce.ru/history/cold_war/strunov/index.htm }} {{ru icon}}</ref>.

==Sino-Soviet split==

{{main|Sino-Soviet split}}

Thus, in the immediate years after the PRC was proclaimed, the Soviet Union became its closest ally. Soviet design, equipment and skilled labour was set out to help [[Industrialisation|industrialize]] and [[Modernization|modernize]] the PRC. But the extent of actual support, while not insignificant, fell well below Chinese expectations. In the 1960s, relations became deeply strained following the [[Sino-Soviet Split]], culminating in the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969. Increasingly, the PRC began to consider the Soviet Union, which it viewed as [[Social-imperialism|Social imperialist]], as the greatest threat it faced. In turn, overtures were made between the PRC and the US, such as in the [[Ping Pong Diplomacy]] and the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]].

==Post-Mao era and stabilizing relations==
In 1976, Mao died, and in 1978, the [[Gang of Four]] were overthrown by [[Deng Xiaoping]], who was to soon implement pro-market [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]]. With the PRC no longer espousing the [[anti-revisionist]] notion of the [[antagonistic contradiction]] between classes, relations between the two countries became gradually normalized. In 1979, however, the PRC launched the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], a failed invasion of [[Vietnam]] (which had, after a period of ambivalence, sided with the Soviet Union) in response to Vietnam's invasion of [[Cambodia]] which overthrew the China-backed [[Khmer Rouge]] from power. Even though Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] went on to criticize the post-Maoist CCP when it allowed for PRC millionaires as having lost the [[socialism|socialist]] path, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 90s, the Soviet Union itself turned to [[privatization]].

==Dissolution of the Soviet Union==
But unlike in the PRC, this was a much more extreme, highly unregulated form of privatization which resulted in massive losses to foreign speculators, near-anarchical conditions and economic collapse.  Thus, in the post-[[Cold War]] period, while the Soviet Union remained vastly more developed (economically and militarily), in a systemic and deep way (''i.e.'', the PRC in 1949 was less industrialized than Russia in 1914), the PRC emerged in a far more favourable and stable financial position. But whereas the severe Soviet shortage of capital was new, Chinese economic and military underdevelopment was not. Nor was the PRC's desperate and ever-growing need for mineral resources, especially [[petroleum]] [[fuel]], which the Soviet Union held in abundance in such Asiatic regions as western [[Siberia]].
