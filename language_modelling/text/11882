'''Kamala Khan''' is a fictional character appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by editor [[Sana Amanat]], writer [[G. Willow Wilson]], and artist [[Adrian Alphona]], Khan is Marvel's first [[Muslim]] character to headline her own comic book. Khan made her first appearance in ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #14 (August 2013) before headlining the ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' comic book series in February 2014.

Within the [[Marvel Universe]], Khan is a teenage [[Pakistani American]] from [[New Jersey]] with [[shapeshifting]] abilities, who discovers that she has [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] genes in the aftermath of the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline and assumes the codename '''Ms. Marvel''' from her [[Teen idol|idol]] [[Carol Danvers]]. Marvel's announcement that a Muslim character would headline a comic book was met with widespread online reactions and the first issue of ''Ms. Marvel'' received favorable reviews from critics.

== Publication history ==
In  November 2013, Marvel Comics announced that Kamala Khan, a teenage [[Islam in the United States|Muslim American]] from [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], would take over the comic book series ''[[Ms. Marvel]]'' beginning in February 2014. The series, written by [[G. Willow Wilson]] and drawn by [[Adrian Alphona]], marks the first time a Muslim character has headlined a book at Marvel Comics.<ref name="Marvel">{{cite web |last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |date=November 6, 2013|title=All-New Marvel NOW!

Amanat said, "I was telling him [Wacker] some crazy anecdote about my childhood, growing up as a Muslim-American. He found it hilarious." The pair then told Wilson about the concept and Wilson became eager to jump aboard the project.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |last=Gustines |first=George |date=November 5, 2013|title=Marvel Comics Introducing a Muslim Girl Superhero |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/books/marvel-comics-introducing-a-muslim-girl-superhero.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Amanat said that the series came from a "desire to explore the Muslim-American diaspora from an authentic perspective."<ref name="AP">{{cite news |last=More |first=Matt |date=November 5, 2013 |title=In Marvel Comics, Ms Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/marvel-comics-ms-marvel-returns-muslim-teen |work=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

The series not only explores Khan's conflicts with supervillains but also explores conflicts with Khan's home and religious duties. Wilson, a convert to Islam, said "This is not evangelism. It was really important for me to portray Kamala as someone who is struggling with her faith." Wilson continued, "Her brother is extremely conservative, her mom is paranoid that she's going to touch a boy and get pregnant, and her father wants her to concentrate on her studies and become a doctor."<ref name="NYTimes" /> Amanat added, <blockquote>As much as Islam is a part of Kamala<U+2019>s identity, this book isn't preaching about religion or the Islamic faith in particular. It's about what happens when you struggle with the labels imposed on you, and how that forms your sense of self. It's a struggle we've all faced in one form or another, and isn't just particular to Kamala because she's Muslim. Her religion is just one aspect of the many ways she defines herself.<ref name="Marvel" /></blockquote>

In the series, Khan takes the name Ms. Marvel from [[Carol Danvers]], who now goes by the alias [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]. ''Captain Marvel'' writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] revealed that Khan actually made a brief appearance in ''Captain Marvel'' #14 (August 2013) saying, "Kamala is in the background of a scene in ''Captain Marvel'' 14... She is very deliberately placed in a position where she sees Carol protecting civilians from [[Yon-Rogg]]."<ref>{{cite AV media |last=Thompson |first=Kelly |date=2013-11-18 |title=3 Chicks Review Comics <U+2013> Episode 064 | medium=[[Podcast]] |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/11/18/3-chicks-review-comics-episode-064/ |accessdate=2013-12-06 |format=[[MP3]] |time =1:37:40 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]}}</ref> About Khan's relationship with Danvers, Wilson said, <blockquote>She looks up to Carol because she's saved worlds with her bare hands <U+2013> literally. She really idolizes Carol, and is an ideal she looks up to. So when she gets powers of her own, it makes sense for her to take that younger Captain Marvel role up.<ref name="Newsarama">{{cite web |last=Arrant |first=Chris |date=November 6, 2013 |title=G.

She's strong, beautiful and doesn't have any of the baggage of being Pakistani and 'different'".<ref name="NYTimes" /> "Khan is a big comic book fan and after she discovers her superhuman power &ndash; being a polymorph and able to lengthen her arms and legs and change her shape &ndash; she takes on the name of Ms. Marvel," Amanat elaborated.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reaney |first=Patricia |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Pow!

Regarding the effect that Jersey City has on Kamala Khan, Wilson said:
<blockquote>She's very much the kind of girl who grew up staring wistfully at [[Manhattan]], thinking 'If only I could make it to the big city.' Jersey City is not just the backdrop of the series, but very much a part of Kamala's own journey. She becomes kind of defiant and defensive; Jersey is her turf, it's where she grew up and she's not an apologist about it. Jersey City oftentimes seems to play second fiddle to New York City, with all of the action taking place across in NYC and Jersey City being where people go to dump stuff or discard things. A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel is a "second string hero" in the "second string city" and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person.<ref name="Newsarama" /></blockquote>

=== Initial reaction ===
Marvel's announcement was met with widespread reactions online. Fatemeh Fakhraie, founder of ''Muslimah Media Watch'', a diversity [[advocacy group]], told [[Al Jazeera America]] that "She is going to be a window into the American Muslim experience" and that she "normalizes this idea of the American experience as Muslim."<ref>{{cite news |last=De Bode |first=Lisa |date=November 5, 2013 |title=Ms. Marvel returns as Muslim teen |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/11/5/ms-marvel-returnsasmuslimteen.html |work=[[Al Jazeera America]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Brett White of [[Comic Book Resources]] said, "With Kamala Khan, the daughter of Pakistani immigrants living in Jersey City, Marvel Comics has shown yet again that it wants to include groups of the American population that have yet to be personally inspired by their heroes."<ref>{{cite web |last=White |first=Brett |date=November 6, 2013 |title=In Your Face Jam: Ms. Marvel Is Important |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48963 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Hussein Rashid writing for [[CNN]] said, "The character of Kamala Khan has the opportunity to offer something new to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims.

=== Critical reaction ===
Meagan Damore of ''Comic Book Resources'' said, "There is nothing not to love about ''Ms. Marvel'' #1: every character is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and <U+2014> at times <U+2014> downright funny."<ref>{{cite web |last=Damore |first=Meagan |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=6953 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> Jen Aprahamian of ''[[Comic Vine]]'' said "''Ms. Marvel'' makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart even before she puts on a mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor in a way that doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world <U+2014> a universe, even <U+2014> of story possibilities."<ref>{{cite web |last=Aprahamian |first=Jen |date=February 4, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.comicvine.com/reviews/ms-marvel-1/1900-2673/ |publisher=[[Comic Vine]] |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref> Joshua Yehl of ''[[IGN]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love."<ref>{{cite web |last=Yehl |first=Joshua |date=February 5, 2014 |title=Ms. Marvel #1 Review |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/05/ms-marvel-1-review-2 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> George Marston of ''[[Newsarama]]'' said, "''Ms. Marvel'' is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G.

It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Marston |first=George |date=February 3, 2014 |title=Best Shots Advance Reviews: MS.
