'''David William Donald Cameron''' (born 9 October 1966) is the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] in the United Kingdom. He has occupied both positions since December 2005.

He read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], gaining a [[first class honours]] degree.<ref name="David Cameron MP - About David">{{cite web|url=http://www.davidcameronmp.com|title= David Cameron MP - About David|accessdate=2009-07-20|publisher=the conservative party}}</ref> He then joined the [[Conservative Research Department]] and became [[Special Adviser]] to [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]], and then to [[Michael Howard]]. He was Director of Corporate Affairs at [[Carlton Communications]] for seven years.

A first  candidacy for Parliament at [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]] in 1997 ended in defeat but Cameron was elected in [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]] as [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Oxfordshire]] constituency of [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]]. Promoted to the [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|Opposition]] [[Frontbencher|front bench]] two years after entering Parliament, he rose rapidly to be head of policy co-ordination during the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election campaign]].<ref name="BBC News Cameron Story">Brian Wheeler, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4502656.stm "The David Cameron Story"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 6 December 2005, accessed 27 March 2007.</ref><ref name="BBC Contender">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4651553.stm "Contender: David Cameron"], ''BBC News Online'', 29 September 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref>

==Background==
===Family===
David Cameron was born in [[London]], brought up at [[Peasemore]] (near [[Newbury, Berkshire]]),<ref name="Rise">{{cite book | last = Elliott | first = Francis | coauthors = Hanning, James | title = Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative | publisher = HarperPress | year = 2007}}</ref> but spent much of his early life in [[Totley]], near [[Sheffield]], the son of [[stockbroker]] Ian Donald Cameron and his wife, Mary Fleur Mount, the second daughter of [[Sir William Mount, 2nd Baronet]].<ref name="thePeerage.com">[http://www.thepeerage.com/p17890.htm#i178897 "Person Page 17890"], ''thePeerage.com: A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the [[Royal family|royal families]] of Europe'', accessed 25 November 2006</ref> He has a brother, Alec and two sisters, Tania and Clare.<ref name="BBC News Cameron Story"/>

His father was born at [[Blairmore House]], near [[Huntly, Scotland|Huntly]] in Scotland,<ref name="Slains Castle">Aberdeen Civic Society, [http://beehive.thisisnorthscotland.co.uk/default.asp?WCI=SiteHome&ID=2311&PageID=55325 "David Cameron and Slains Castle"], 2 March 2006, accessed 4 September 2007</ref> which was built by Cameron's grandfather Ewen Donald Cameron's maternal grandfather, Alexander Geddes<ref name="Geddes marriage">''[[The Times]]'', "[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1905-07-24-01&articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1905-07-24-01-002 Marriages]", 24 July 1905</ref> who had made a fortune in the [[grain]] business in [[Chicago]] and had returned to Scotland in the 1880s.<ref name="Highlands">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Content/displayPrintable.jhtml?xml=/property/2002/01/26/pblair26.xml&site=16&page=0 "Highlands for the high life"], ''[[telegraph.co.uk]]'', 26 March 2002, accessed 4 September 2007</ref> The [[Clan Cameron|Cameron]] family were originally from the [[Inverness]] area of the [[Scottish Highlands]].<ref name="Clan Cameron">Robert Cameron, [http://www.clan-cameron.org.au/getperson.php?personID=I34514&tree=cameron1 "Ewen Cameron"], Cameron Genealogies, accessed 9 March 2007</ref>

His father's family had a very long history in the world of finance: David Cameron's great-grandfather Arthur Francis Levita (brother of Sir [[Cecil Levita]])<ref name="Levita">[http://www.thepeerage.com/p17891.htm "Enid Agnes Maud Levita and others"] ''thePeerage.com: A genealogical survey of the peerage of Britain as well as the royal families of Europe'', accessed 9 March 2007</ref> of Panmure Gordon stockbrokers and his great-great-grandfather Sir [[Ewen Cameron (banker)|Ewen Cameron]],<ref name="Clan Cameron" /> London head of the [[The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation|Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank]], played key roles in discussions led by the [[Rothschilds]] with the Japanese central banker (later [[Prime Minister]]) [[Takahashi Korekiyo]] concerning the selling of [[war bonds]] during the [[Russo-Japanese war]].<ref name="Rothschild archive">Richard Smethurst, [http://www.rothschildarchive.org/ib/articles/AR2006Japan.pdf "Takahasi Korekiyo, the Rothschilds and the Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1907"], accessed 4 September 2007</ref>
[[Image:William.IV.of.Great.Britain.JPG|thumb|Cameron's ancestor, King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (1765-1837), uncle of [[Queen Victoria]]]]
His great-grandfather Ewen Allan Cameron, a senior partner with [[Panmure Gordon]] stockbrokers, was also a notable figure in the financial world serving on the [[Council for Foreign Bondholders]]<ref name="Foreign Bondholders">''[[The Times]]'', "Council of Foreign Bondholders", 24 July 1936</ref> and the Committee for Chinese Bondholders set up by the then-[[Governor of the Bank of England]] [[Montagu Norman]] in November, 1935.<ref>''[[The Times]]'', "Committee for Bondholders", 2 November 1935</ref> His father and  grandfather, Ian Donald and Ewen Donald, also worked for Panmure Gordon stockbrokers; Ian Donald also served as a director of the [[estate agent|estate agency]] John D. Wood.<ref name="BBC News Cameron Story"/>

Cameron is a direct descendant of [[Queen Victoria]]'s uncle and predecessor on the throne, King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] (4th great-grandfather) and his mistress [[Dorothea Jordan]] (and thus 5th cousin, twice removed of Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]) through his father's maternal grandmother Stephanie Levita, daughter of the society surgeon Sir [[Alfred Cooper]], who was also father of the statesman and author [[Duff Cooper]], grandfather of the publisher and [[Intellectual|man of letters]] [[Rupert Hart-Davis]] and historian [[John Julius Norwich]], and great-grandfather of the [[Presenter|TV presenter]] [[Adam Hart-Davis]] and journalist/writer [[Duff Hart-Davis]] (David Cameron's second cousins [[Cousin chart|once removed]]). His mother is first cousin of the writer and [[Pundit (politics)|political commentator]] [[Ferdinand Mount]].<ref name="Relations"> Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007) discuss Cameron's family on pp. 1-9</ref>

===Education===
====Heatherdown Preparatory School====
At the age of seven, Cameron attended the independent [[Heatherdown Preparatory School]] at [[Winkfield]] in [[Berkshire]], which counted [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]] among its alumni. The school closed in the early 1980s, and the grounds are now occupied by the [[Licensed Victuallers' School]].

====Eton College====
Cameron was educated at [[Eton College]], often described as the most famous [[independent school]] in the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jun/26/monarchy.publicschools |title= Eton waits for verdict in Harry 'cheating' case in [[The Observer]]|accessdate=2005-07-26 |format= |work= }}</ref> and traditionally referred to as "the chief nurse of England's statesmen".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/162402.stm Eton - the establishment's choice] in [[BBC News]], September 2, 1998</ref> He followed his elder brother Alex, who was three years above him;<ref name="Brother">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 26.</ref> his early interest was in art.<ref name="Brother"/> Cameron is alleged to have faced trouble as a teenager in May 1983, six weeks before taking his [[General Certificate of Education#O-level|O-levels]], when he had allegedly smoked [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Because he admitted the offence and had not been involved in selling drugs, he was not expelled, but he was fined, prevented from leaving school grounds, and given a "[[Georgic]]" (a punishment which involved copying 500 lines of [[Latin language|Latin]] text).<ref name="Cannabis punishment">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 32.</ref>

Cameron recovered from this episode and passed 12 O-levels, and then studied three [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-Levels]] in [[History of Art]], History and Economics with Politics. He obtained three 'A' grades and a '1' grade in the [[Scholarship Level]] exam in Economics and Politics.<ref name="A levels">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 45-6.</ref> He then stayed on to sit the entrance exam for the [[University of Oxford]], which was sat the following autumn. He passed, did well at interview, and was given a place at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]], his first choice.<ref name="Oxford entrance">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 46.</ref>

After finally leaving Eton just before Christmas 1984, Cameron had nine months of a [[gap year]] before going up to Oxford. In January he began work as a researcher for [[Tim Rathbone]], Conservative MP for [[Lewes (UK Parliament constituency)|Lewes]] and his godfather, in his Parliamentary office. He was there only for three months, but used the time to attend debates in the House of Commons.<ref name="Tim Rathbone">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 46-7.</ref> Through his father, he was then employed for a further three months in [[Hong Kong]] by [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] as a 'ship jumper', an administrative post for which no experience was needed but which gave him some experience of work.<ref name="Jardines">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 47-8.</ref>

Returning from Hong Kong he visited [[Moscow]] and a [[Yalta]] beach in the [[Soviet Union]], and was at one point approached by two Russian men speaking fluent English. Cameron was later told by one of his professors that it was 'definitely an attempt' by the [[KGB]] to recruit him.<ref name="KGB">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cameron: KGB tried to recruit me |curly=y |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5021166.stm |work=BBC News Online |publisher= |date=2006-05-28 |accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref>

====Oxford====
Cameron studied at the [[University of Oxford]], where he read for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Philosophy, Politics, and Economics]] (PPE) at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]]. His tutor at Oxford, Professor [[Vernon Bogdanor]], described him as "one of the ablest"<ref name="Sunday Times">[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/biography/article1545297.ece "Too good to be true?"], ''[[The Times]] Online'', 25 March 2007, accessed 29 March 2007</ref> students he has taught, with "moderate and sensible Conservative" [[Ideology|political views]].<ref name="BBC News Cameron Story" /> When commenting in 2006 on his former pupil's ideas about a bill of rights to replace the human rights act, however, Professor Bogdanor, himself a [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrat]], said, "I think he is very confused. I've read his speech and it's filled with contradictions. There are one or two good things in it but one glimpses them, as it were, through a mist of misunderstanding".<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/jul/01/comment.politics</ref>

While at Oxford, Cameron was captain of Brasenose College's [[tennis]] team.<ref name="BBC News Cameron Story" /> He was also a member of the student dining society the [[Bullingdon Club]], which has a reputation for an outlandish drinking culture associated with boisterous behaviour and damaging property.<ref name="clubmembership">Patrick Foster, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2012918,00.html "How young Cameron wined and dined with the right sort"], ''The Times Online'', 28 January 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> A photograph showing Cameron in a [[tailcoat]] with other members of the club, including [[Boris Johnson]], surfaced in 2007, but was later withdrawn by the copyright holder.<ref name="Photo withdrawn">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6409757.stm "Cameron student photo is banned"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', 2 March 2007, accessed 27 March 2007</ref> Cameron's period in the [[Bullingdon Club]] is examined in the Channel 4 docu-drama ''When Boris Met Dave'' broadcast on 7 October 2009.<ref>JOHN DOWER and JAGO LEE [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1215635/Our-Boys-Bullingdon-The-early-years-David-Cameron-Boris-Johnson.html Our Boys from the Bullingdon: The early years of David Cameron and Boris Johnson] ''Daily Mail'' 26 September 2009</ref> He also belonged to the Octagon Club,<ref name="clubmembership"/> another dining society.

==Political career==
===Conservative Research Department===
After graduation, Cameron worked for the [[Conservative Research Department]] between 1988 and 1993.  A feature on Cameron in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' on 18 March 2007 reported that on the day he was due to attend a job interview at [[Conservative Central Office]], a phone call was received from [[Buckingham Palace]].  The male caller stated, "I understand you are to see David Cameron. I've tried everything I can to dissuade him from wasting his time on politics but I have failed. I am ringing to tell you that you are about to meet a truly remarkable young man."<ref name="many faces">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=442913&in_page_id=1770|author=Francis Elliott and James Hanning |title=The many faces of Mr. Cameron |publisher=''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' |date=18 March 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2007}}</ref>

In 1991, Cameron was seconded to [[Downing Street]] to work on briefing [[John Major]] for his then bi-weekly session of [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. One newspaper gave Cameron the credit for "sharper ... [[dispatch box|despatch box]] performances" by Major,<ref name="Major PMQs">"Atticus", ''Sunday Times'', 30 June 1991.</ref> which included highlighting for Major "a dreadful piece of [[doublespeak]]" by [[Tony Blair]] (then the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Employment spokesman) over the effect of a national [[minimum wage]].<ref name="Blair minimum wage">[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199091/cmhansrd/1991-06-27/Orals-2.html "House of Commons 6th series, vol. 193, cols. 1133-34"], ''Hansard'', accessed 4 September 2007</ref> He became head of the political section of the Conservative Research Department, and in August 1991 was tipped to follow [[Judith Chaplin]] as Political Secretary to the Prime Minister.<ref name="CRD">"Diary", ''The Times'', 14 August 1991.</ref>

However, Cameron lost out to Jonathan Hill, who was appointed in March 1992. He was given the responsibility for briefing John Major for his press conferences during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]].<ref name="1992 election">Nicholas Wood, "New aide for Prime Minister", ''The Times'', 13 March 1992.</ref> During the campaign, Cameron was one of the young "Brat pack" of party strategists who worked between 12 and 20 hours a day, sleeping in the house of [[Alan Duncan]] in [[Gayfere Street]], which had been Major's campaign headquarters during his bid for the Conservative leadership.<ref name="1992 campaign">"Sleep little babies", ''The Times'', 20 March 1992.</ref> Cameron headed the economic section; it was while working on this campaign that Cameron first worked closely with [[Steve Hilton]], who was later to become Director of Strategy during his party leadership.<ref name="Meets Hilton">Nicholas Wood, "Strain starts to show on Major's round the clock 'brat pack'", ''The Times'', 23 March 1992.</ref> The strain of getting up at 4:45 AM every day was reported to have led Cameron to decide to leave politics in favour of journalism.<ref name="Journalism">"Campaign fall-out", ''The Times'', 30 March 1992.</ref>

===Special Advisor===
The Conservatives' unexpected success in the 1992 election led Cameron to hit back at older party members who had criticised him and his colleagues. He was quoted as saying, the day after the election, "whatever people say about us, we got the campaign right," and that they had listened to their campaign workers on the ground rather than the newspapers. He revealed he had led other members of the team across [[Smith Square]] to jeer at [[Transport House]], the former Labour headquarters.<ref name="1992 post mortem">Andrew Pierce, "We got it right, say Patten's brat pack", ''Sunday Times'', 11 March 1992.</ref> Cameron was rewarded with a promotion to Special Advisor to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Norman Lamont (1942)|Norman Lamont]].<ref name="Lamont's Spad">"Brats on the move", ''The Times'', 14 April 1992.</ref>

Cameron was working for Lamont at the time of [[Black Wednesday]], when pressure from currency speculators forced the [[Pound sterling]] out of the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Cameron, who was unknown to the public at the time, can be spotted at Lamont's side in news film of the latter's announcement of British withdrawal from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]] that evening. At the 1992 Conservative Party conference in October, Cameron had a tough time trying to arrange to brief the speakers in the economic debate, having to resort to putting messages on the internal television system imploring the mover of the motion, [[Patricia Morris, Baroness Morris of Bolton|Patricia Morris]], to contact him.<ref name="1992 conference">"Diary", ''The Times'', 8 October 1992.</ref> Later that month Cameron joined a delegation of Special Advisers who visited Germany to build better relations with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]]; he was reported to be "still smarting" over the [[Bundesbank]]'s contribution to the economic crisis.<ref name="Germany visit">"Peace-mongers", ''The Times'', 20 October 1992.</ref>

Cameron's boss Norman Lamont fell out with John Major after Black Wednesday and became highly unpopular with the public. Taxes needed to be raised in the 1993 budget, and Cameron fed the options Lamont was considering through to Conservative Central Office for their political acceptability to be assessed.<ref name="1993 budget">David Hencke, "Treasury tax review eyes fuel and children's clothes", ''The Guardian'', 8 February 1993.</ref> However, Lamont's unpopularity did not necessarily affect Cameron: he was considered as a potential "[[kamikaze]]" candidate for the [[Newbury by-election, 1993|Newbury by-election]], which included the area where he grew up.<ref name="Newbury">Michael White and Patrick Wintour, "Points of Order", ''The Guardian'', 26 February 1993.</ref> However, Cameron decided not to run.

During the by-election, Lamont gave the response "[[Non, je ne regrette rien|Je ne regrette rien]]" to a question about whether he most regretted claiming to see "the green shoots of recovery" or admitted "singing in his bath" with happiness at leaving the ERM. Cameron was identified by one journalist as having inspired this [[gaffe]]; it was speculated that the heavy Conservative defeat in Newbury may have cost Cameron his chance of becoming Chancellor himself (even though as he was not a Member of Parliament he could not have been).<ref name="Piaf">"Careless talk", ''The Times'', 10 May 1993.</ref> Lamont was sacked at the end of May 1993, and decided not to write the usual letter of resignation; Cameron was given the responsibility to issue to the press a statement of self-justification.<ref name="Lamont sacked">David Smith and Michael Prescott, "Norman Lamont: the final days" (Focus), ''Sunday Times'', 30 May 1993.</ref>

===Home Office===
After Lamont was sacked, Cameron remained at the Treasury for less than a month before being specifically recruited by [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]]; it was commented that he was still "very much in favour".<ref name="Howard's Spad">"No score flaw", ''The Times'', 22 June 1993.</ref> It was later reported that many at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] would have preferred Cameron to carry on.<ref name="Clarke profile">John Grigg, "Primed Minister", ''The Times'', 2 October 1993.</ref> At the beginning of September 1993, Cameron applied to go on Conservative Central Office's list of Parliamentary candidates.<ref name="Candidates list">"Newbury's finest", ''The Times'', 6 September 1993.</ref>

According to [[Derek Lewis (prison governor)|Derek Lewis]], then Director-General of the Prison Service, Cameron showed him a "his and hers list" of proposals made by Howard and his wife, Sandra. Lewis said that [[Sandra Howard]]'s list included reducing the quality of prison food, although Sandra Howard denied this claim. Lewis reported that Cameron was "uncomfortable" about the list.<ref name="Prison food">David Leigh, "Mrs Howard's own recipe for prison reform", ''The Observer'', 23 February 1997.</ref> In defending Sandra Howard and insisting that she made no such proposal, the journalist [[Bruce Anderson (columnist)|Bruce Anderson]] wrote that Cameron had proposed a much shorter definition on prison catering which revolved around the phrase "balanced diet", and that Lewis had written thanking Cameron for a valuable contribution.<ref name="Anderson">Bruce Anderson, "Derek Lewis: Big job, little man, inaccurate book", ''The Spectator'', 1 March 1997.</ref>

During his work for Howard, Cameron often briefed the press. In March 1994, someone leaked to the press that the Labour Party had called for a meeting with John Major to discuss a consensus on the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts|Prevention of Terrorism Act]]. After a leak inquiry failed to find the culprit, Labour MP [[Peter Mandelson]] demanded of Howard that he give an assurance that Cameron had not been responsible, which Howard gave.<ref name="Leak">Patrick Wintour, "Smith fumes at untraced leak", ''The Guardian'', 10 March 1994.</ref><ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199394/cmhansrd/1994-03-09/Debate-1.html "6th Series, vol. 239 col. 292"], ''Hansard'', 9 March 1994, accessed 4 September 2007</ref>

===Carlton===
In July 1994, Cameron left his role as Special Adviser to work as the Director of Corporate Affairs at [[Carlton Communications]].<ref name="Carlton job">"Smallweed", ''The Guardian'', 16 July 1994.</ref> Carlton, which had won the [[ITV]] franchise for London weekdays in 1991, were a growing media company which also had film distribution and video producing arms. In 1997 Cameron played up the company's prospects for [[digital terrestrial television]], for which it joined with [[Granada television]] and [[BSkyB]] to form [[ITV Digital|British Digital Broadcasting]].<ref name="Carlton DTT">"Confident Carlton shrugs off digital licence doubts", ''[[Daily Express|The Express]]'', 22 May 1997.</ref> In a roundtable discussion on the future of broadcasting in 1998 he criticised the effect of overlapping different regulators on the industry.<ref name="Regulatory overlap">"We can't wait any longer to map the digital mediascape", ''[[New Statesman]]'', 3 April 1998.</ref>

Carlton's consortium did win the digital terrestrial franchise but the resulting company suffered difficulties in attracting subscribers. In 1999 the ''[[Daily Express|Express]] on Sunday'' newspaper claimed Cameron had rubbished one of its stories which had given an accurate number of subscribers, because he wanted the number to appear higher than expected.<ref name="Ondigital subscribers">"Unsportsmanlike spinning", ''The Express on Sunday'', 10 October 1999.</ref> Cameron resigned as Director of Corporate Affairs in February 2001 in order to fight for election to Parliament, although he remained on the payroll as a consultant.<ref name="Carlton consultant">"Blackfriar", ''The Express'', 1 March 2001.</ref>

===Parliamentary candidacy===
Having been approved for the candidates' list, Cameron began looking for a seat. He was reported to have missed out on selection for [[Ashford (UK Parliament constituency)|Ashford]] in December 1994 after failing to get to the selection meeting due to train delays.<ref name="Ashford">"Pendennis", ''The Guardian'', 1 January 1995</ref> Early in 1996, he was selected for [[Stafford (UK Parliament constituency)|Stafford]], a new constituency created in boundary changes, which was projected to have a Conservative majority.<ref name="Stafford candidate">[[Michael White (journalist)|Michael White]], "Seat-seeking missiles", ''The Guardian'', 9 March 1996.</ref> At the 1996 Conservative Party conference he called for tax cuts in the forthcoming budget to be targeted at the low paid and to "small businesses where people took money out of their own pockets to put into companies to keep them going".<ref name="Conference 1996">Jill Sherman, "Clarke challenged to show gains of economic recovery", ''The Times'', 11 October 1996.</ref>  He also said the party, "Should be proud of the Tory tax record but that people needed reminding of its achievements...It's time to return to our tax cutting agenda. The [[Socialism|Socialist]] Prime Ministers of Europe have endorsed Tony Blair because they want a federal pussy cat and not a British lion."<ref>BBC Archive, [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/ANCC839F_E "Conservative Party Conference 1996"], 10 October 1996</ref>

When writing his election address, Cameron made his own opposition to British membership of the [[single European currency]] clear, pledging not to support it. This was a break with official Conservative policy but about 200 other candidates were making similar declarations.<ref name="Single currency 1997">Alan Travis, "Rebels' seven-year march", ''The Guardian'', 17 April 1997.</ref> Otherwise, Cameron kept very closely to the national party line. He also campaigned using the claim that a Labour government would increase the cost of a pint of beer by 24p; however the Labour candidate [[David Kidney]] portrayed Cameron as "a right-wing Tory". Stafford had a [[Swing (politics)|swing]] almost the same as the national swing, which made it one of the many seats to fall to Labour: David Kidney had a majority of 4,314.<ref name="1997 election">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p.172-5.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/constituencies/533.htm Stafford 1997 election result], ''BBC News Online'', accessed 4 September 2007</ref>
In the round of selection contests taking place in the run-up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Cameron again attempted to be selected for a winnable seat. He tried out for the [[Kensington and Chelsea by-election, 1999|Kensington and Chelsea]] seat after the death of [[Alan Clark]],<ref name="Kensington byelection">Ben Leapman, "100 challenge Portillo", ''Evening Standard'', 21 September 1999.</ref> but did not make the shortlist.

He was in the final two but narrowly lost at [[Wealden (UK Parliament constituency)|Wealden]] in March 2000,<ref name="Wealden">Michael White, "Rightwingers and locals preferred for safe Tory seats", ''The Guardian'', 14 March 2000.</ref> a loss ascribed by Samantha Cameron to his lack of spontaneity when speaking.<ref name="Spontaneity">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 193.</ref>

On 4 April 2000 Cameron was selected as prospective candidate for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. This was a safe Conservative seat but its sitting MP [[Shaun Woodward]] (who had worked with Cameron on the 1992 election campaign) had joined the Labour Party; newspapers claimed Cameron and Woodward had "loathed each other",<ref name="Woodward">"Ephraim Hardcastle", ''Daily Mail'', 7 April 2000.</ref> although Cameron's biographers Francis Elliott and James Hanning describe them as being "on fairly friendly terms".<ref name=autogenerated1>Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 192.</ref> Cameron put a great deal of effort into "nursing" his constituency, turning up at social functions, and attacked Woodward for changing his mind on [[fox hunting]] to support a ban.<ref name="Woodward hunting">"Why Shaun Woodward changed his mind" (Letter), ''Daily Telegraph'', 21 December 2000.</ref>

During the election campaign, Cameron accepted the offer of writing a regular column for ''[[The Guardian]]'''s online section.<ref name="Guardian column">See [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Archive/0,9328,649666,00.html "The Cameron diaries"].</ref> He won the seat with a 1.9% swing to the Conservatives and a majority of 7,973.<ref name="2001 election result">''Dod's Guide to the General Election June 2001'' (Vacher Dod Publishing, 2001), p. 430.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/results_constituencies/constituencies/637.stm "Vote 2001: Results & Constituencies: Witney"], ''BBC News Online'', accessed 4 September 2007</ref>

===Member of Parliament===
Upon his election to Parliament, he served as a member of the Commons Home Affairs [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]], a plum choice for a new MP. It was Cameron's proposal that the Committee launch an inquiry into the law on drugs,<ref name="Drugs inquiry">Francis Elliott and James Hanning, ''Cameron: The Rise of the New Conservative'' (4th Estate, 2007), p. 200.</ref> and during the inquiry he urged the consideration of "radical options".<ref name="Radical options">[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmhaff/318/1103008.htm "Examination of Witnesses: question 123"], ''Hansard'', 30 October 2001, accessed 4 September 2007</ref> The report recommended a downgrading of [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|Ecstasy]] from Class A to Class B, as well as moves towards a policy of '[[harm reduction]]', which Cameron defended.<ref name="Inject reality">"Let's inject reality into the drugs war", ''Edinburgh Evening News'', 22 May 2002.</ref>

Cameron determinedly attempted to increase his public profile, offering quotes on matters of public controversy. He opposed the payment of compensation to [[Gurbux Singh]], who had resigned as head of the [[Commission for Racial Equality]] after a confrontation with the police;<ref name="Gurbux Singh">Philip Johnston, Becky Barrow, "<U+00A3>115,000 for race chief in drunken fracas", ''Daily Telegraph'', 8 August 2002.</ref> and commented that the Home Affairs Select Committee had taken a long time to discuss whether the phrase "black market" should be used.<ref name="Black market">"They said what?", ''Observer'', 30 June 2002.</ref> However, he was passed over for a front bench promotion in July 2002; Conservative leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] did invite Cameron and his ally [[George Osborne]] to coach him on Prime Minister's Questions in November 2002. The next week, Cameron deliberately abstained in a vote on allowing same sex and unmarried couples to adopt children jointly, against a whip to oppose; his abstention was noted.<ref name="Adoption vote">"Rebels and non-voters", ''The Times'', 6 November 2002.</ref> The wide scale of abstentions and rebellious votes destabilised the Iain Duncan Smith leadership.

In June 2003, Cameron was appointed as a [[Shadow Minister|shadow minister]] in the [[Privy Council Office]] as a deputy to [[Eric Forth]] who was then Shadow [[Leader of the House]]. He also became a vice-[[chairman of the Conservative Party]] when [[Michael Howard]] took over the leadership in November of that year. He was appointed to the opposition frontbench [[local government]] spokesman in 2004 before being promoted into the [[shadow cabinet]] that June as head of policy co-ordination. Later he became shadow [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|education secretary]] in the post-election reshuffle.<ref name="BBC Contender"/>

From February 2002<ref name="Chorion director">"Alli toying with Noddy", ''The Sun'', 26 February 2002.

==Leadership of the Conservative Party==
[[Image:davidcameroncampaign.JPG|thumb|David Cameron campaigning for the 2006 local elections in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]]]
===Leadership election===
{{Main|Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005}}
Following the Labour victory in the May 2005 [[General election|General Election]], [[Michael Howard]] announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party and set a lengthy timetable for the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005|leadership election]], as part of a plan (subsequently rejected) to change the leadership election rules.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Cameron announced formally that he would be a candidate for the position on 29 September 2005. Parliamentary colleagues supporting him initially included [[Boris Johnson]], Shadow Chancellor [[George Osborne]], then Shadow [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] and [[Deputy Leader|deputy leader]] of the party [[Michael Ancram]], [[Oliver Letwin]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4304664.stm "Tory leadership: Who backed who?"], ''BBC News Online'', 17 October 2005, accessed 25 November 2006</ref> and former party leader [[William Hague]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4432120.stm "Hague backs Cameron as new leader"], ''BBC News Online'', 12 November 2005, accessed 25 November 2006</ref> Despite this, his campaign did not gain significant support prior to the 2005 Conservative [[Party conference|Party Conference]]. However his speech, delivered without notes, proved a significant turning point. In the speech he vowed to make people, "feel good about being Conservatives again" and said he wanted, "to switch on a whole new generation."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4306540.stm "Cameron targets 'new generation'"], ''BBC News Online'', 4 October 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref>

In the first ballot of Conservative MPs on 18 October 2005, Cameron came second, with 56 votes, slightly more than expected; [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] had fewer than predicted at 62 votes; [[Liam Fox]] came third with 42 votes and [[Ken Clarke]] was eliminated with 38 votes. In the second ballot on 20 October 2005, Cameron came first with 90 votes; David Davis was second, with 57, and Liam Fox was eliminated with 51 votes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4360662.stm "Cameron and Davis top Tory poll"], ''BBC News Online'', 20 October 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> All 198 Conservative MPs voted in both ballots.

The next stage of the election process, between Davis and Cameron, was a vote open to the entire Conservative party membership. Cameron was elected with more than twice as many votes as Davis and more than half of all ballots issued; Cameron won 134,446 votes on a 78% [[turnout]], beating Davis's 64,398 votes.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4502652.stm "Cameron chosen as new Tory leader"], ''BBC News Online'', 6 December 2005, accessed 25 November 2006</ref>.  Although Davis had initially been the favourite, it was widely acknowledged that Davis's candidacy was marred by a disappointing conference speech, whilst Cameron's was well received.  Cameron's election as the Leader of the Conservative Party and [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]], was announced on 6 December 2005. As is customary for an Opposition leader not already a member, upon election Cameron became a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], being formally approved to join on 14 December 2005, and sworn of the Council on 8 March 2006.<ref>[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page8762.asp "Privy Council Appointment of David Cameron MP"], ''[[10 Downing Street]]'', 14 December 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref>

Cameron's appearance on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in September 2008 was said by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' to present him to the world as 'Prime Minister in waiting'.<ref name="Time cover">Daniel Martin, "[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1054651/Prime-minister-waiting-David-Cameron-appears-cover-Time-magazine--US-version.html 'Prime minister-in-waiting' David Cameron appears on the cover of Time magazine... but not the US version]", ''Daily Mail'', 12 September 2008. Accessed 1 October 2008.</ref>

===Reaction to his victory===
Cameron's relatively young age and inexperience before becoming leader have invited satirical comparison with Tony Blair. ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye]]'' soon published a picture of both leaders on their front cover, with the caption "World's first face transplant a success".<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1334944.cms "Britain pins its hopes on David"], ''The Times of India, 16 December 2005, accessed 20 September 2007.</ref> He has also been described by comedy writer and broadcaster [[Charlie Brooker]] as being like "a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside" in his Guardian column.<ref>[[Charlie Brooker]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,2048049,00.html "David Cameron is like a hollow Easter egg, with no bag of sweets inside. He's nothing. He's no one"], ''The Guardian'', 2 April 2007, accessed 4 September 2007</ref>

Cameron is reported to be known to friends and family as 'Dave' rather than David, although he invariably uses 'David' in public.<ref name="Rumbelow">Helen Rumbelow, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article524770.ece "The gilded youth whose son steeled him in adversity"], ''The Times'', 21 May 2005, accessed 4 September 2007</ref> However, critics of Cameron often refer to him as "Call me Dave" in an attempt to imply [[populism]] in the same way as "Call me Tony" was used in 1997.<ref name="RichardKay">The first such reference in the [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom|British press]] appears to be Richard Kay, "Cameron taking the Michael", ''Daily Mail'', 1 July 2005, p. 45.</ref> The ''[[The Times|Times]]'' columnist [[Daniel Finkelstein]] has condemned those who attempt to belittle Cameron by calling him 'Dave'.<ref name="Finkelstein">Daniel Finkelstein, [http://timesonline.typepad.com/comment/2006/10/the_dave_test.html "The Dave Test"], ''The Times Comment Central'', 5 October 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref>

Cameron was characterised in a Labour Party political broadcast as "[[Dave the Chameleon]]", who would change what he said to match the expectations of his audience. Cameron later claimed that the broadcast had become his daughter's "favourite video".<ref name="Times weblog">[[Hugo Rifkind]], [http://web.archive.org/web/20060519185114/http://timesonline.typepad.com/ "Well, that worked"], ''The Times'' "People" weblog, 17 May 2006, accessed 9 November 2006</ref>

===Shadow Cabinet appointments===
His [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] appointments have included MPs associated with the various wings of the party. Former leader [[William Hague]] was appointed to the Foreign Affairs brief and [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] was retained as [[Shadow Home Secretary]]. Hague, assisted by Davis, stood in for Cameron during his [[paternity leave]] in February 2006.<ref>{{cite web | title="BBC NEWS | In Depth" | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/guides/457000/457039/html/nn16page1.stm | accessdate= 19 September | accessyear= 2007 }}</ref>

===Eurosceptic caucus===
In June 2009, Cameron sealed a new alliance with the then MEP [[Urszula Krupa]], formerly of the right wing [[League of Polish Families]], and her [[conservative|right-wing]] [[Poland|Polish]] Law and Justice party (PiS), which sits in opposition. The Tory party leader attended a gathering at [[Warsaw]]'s Palladium cinema celebrating the foundation of the new alliance; also present were [[Jaros<U+0142>aw Kaczy<U+0144>ski]], the leader of PiS, and [[Mirek Topol<U+00E1>nek]], leader of the Civic Democratic party (ODS) in the [[Czech Republic]]. Ahead of the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European elections]], Krupa was a co-signatory to an [[open letter]] written to the Polish people, which stated that [[homosexuality]] was a "[[pathology]]" undermining the sanctity of the [[family]], and that [[Christianity]] was the root of European greatness. "We protest against the rising wave of anti-Polishness and the falsifying of history in Europe," they wrote. "We will not tolerate the Germanisation of western and northern Polish territories under the mask of Europeanisation."<ref name="guardian_03062009">{{cite news

As of June 2009, Cameron required a further four partners apart from the Polish and Czech supports to qualify for official [[fraction]] status in the parliament; the rules state that a caucus needs at least 25 [[MEP]]s from at least seven of the 27 [[EU member states]].<ref name="guardian_03062009" /> In forming the caucus, Cameron is reportedly breaking with two decades of co-operation by the UK's Conservative party with the mainstream centre-right Christian democrats in the European parliament, the [[European People's Party]] (EPP)<ref name="guardian_03062009" /> on the grounds that it is dominated by European [[federalism|federalists]] and supporters of the [[Lisbon treaty]], which is opposed by the Tories.<ref name="guardian_03062009" />  EPP leader [[Wilfried Martens]], former [[prime minister of Belgium]], has stated "Cameron's campaign has been to take his party back to the centre in every policy area with one major exception: Europe. [...] I can't understand his tactics. [[Angela Merkel|Merkel]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] will never accept his Euroscepticism."<ref name="guardian_03062009" />

==Policies and views==
{{Main|Political positions of David Cameron}}
===Self-description of views===
Cameron describes himself as a "modern [[compassionate conservative]]" and has spoken of a need for a new style of politics, saying that he was "fed up with the [[Punch and Judy]] politics of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]".<ref>[[Jonathan Freedland]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1660457,00.html "Enough of this love-in: Bush was a compassionate conservative too"], ''Guardian Unlimited'', 7 December 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> He has stated that he is "certainly a big [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] fan, but I don't know whether that makes me a Thatcherite."<ref name="new identity">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4446864.stm "Cameron: Tories need new identity"], ''BBC News Online'', 17 November 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> He has also claimed to be a "liberal Conservative", and "not a deeply ideological person."<ref name="Rawnsley">Andrew Rawnsley, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/focus/story/0,,1669957,00.html "'I'm not a deeply ideological person. I'm a practical one'"], ''Guardian Unlimited'', 18 December 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> Cameron has stated that he does not intend to oppose the government as a matter of course, and will offer his support in areas of agreement. He has urged politicians to concentrate more on improving people's happiness and "general well-being", instead of focusing solely on "financial wealth".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5003314.stm "Make people happier, says Cameron"], ''BBC News Online'', 22 May 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> There have been claims that he described himself to [[journalist]]s at a dinner during the leadership contest as the "[[heir]] to [[Tony Blair|Blair]]".<ref>Andrew Pierce, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1811591,00.html "Horror as Cameron brandishes the B word"], ''The Times Online'', 5 October 2005, accessed 25 November 2006</ref> He believes that British Muslims have a duty to integrate into British culture, but notes that they find aspects such as high family breakdown and high drug use uninspiring, and notes that "Not for the first time, I found myself thinking that it is mainstream Britain which needs to integrate more with the British Asian way of life, not the other way around."<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/may/13/comment.communities</ref>

Mr Cameron co-operated with Dylan Jones, giving him interviews and access, to enable him to produce the book ''Cameron on Cameron''.<ref>[http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10479 "Peter Oborne's review of Cameron on Cameron in Prospect Magazine, 2008-12"]</ref>

===Criticism of other parties and politicians===
Cameron criticised [[Gordon Brown]] (when Brown was [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]) for being "an analogue politician in a digital age" and referred to him as "the roadblock to reform".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4833440.stm "Cameron attacks 'past it' Brown"], ''BBC News Online'', 22 March 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> He has also said that [[John Prescott]] "clearly looks a fool" in light of allegations of ministerial misconduct.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4964082.stm "Cameron: Prescott looks a 'fool'"], ''BBC News Online'', 2 May 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> During a speech to the Ethnic Media Conference on 29 November 2006, Cameron also described [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], as an "ageing [[Left-wing politics|far left]] politician" in reference to Livingstone's views on [[multiculturalism]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6157517.stm "Cameron attacks 'outdated' mayor"], ''BBC News Online'', 30 November 2006, accessed 30 November 2006</ref>

However, Cameron was seen encouraging Conservative MPs to join the [[standing ovation]] given to Tony Blair at the end of his last Prime Minister's Question Time; he had paid tribute to the "huge efforts" Blair had made and said Blair had "considerable achievements to his credit, whether it is peace in Northern Ireland or his work in the developing world, which will endure".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245346.stm "Cameron praises Blair achievement"], ''BBC News Online'', 27 June 2007, accessed 4 September 2007</ref>

In 2006, Cameron made a speech in which he described extremist [[Islamic]] organisations and the [[British National Party]] as "mirror images" to each other, both preaching "creeds of pure hatred".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/jan/29/religion.politics Guardian.co.uk - Muslim extremists are mirror image of BNP, says Cameron]</ref> Cameron is listed as being a supporter of [[Unite Against Fascism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uaf.org.uk/aboutUAF.asp?choice=4|title=supporters of Unite against Fascism|publisher=Unite Against Fascism|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>

Cameron, in the autumn of 2009, urged the [[Lib Dems]] to join the Tories in a new "national movement" arguing there was "barely a cigarette paper" between them on a large number of issues. The invitation was rejected by the Liberal party leader, [[Nick Clegg]], who  attacked Cameron at the start of his party's annual conference in Bournemouth, saying that the Tories were totally different from his party and that the Lib Dems were the true "progressives" in UK politics.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8264994.stm</ref>

===Criticism of Cameron's policies===
''[[New Statesman]]'' has unfavourably likened his "new style of politics" to Tony Blair's early leadership years.<ref name="Blameron">Nick Cohen, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200508080017 "The birth of Blameron"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 8 August 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> Cameron has been accused of paying excessive attention to image. [[ITV News]] broadcast footage from the 2006 Conservative Party Conference in [[Bournemouth]] which showed Cameron wearing four different sets of clothes within the space of a few hours.<ref name="ITN clothes">{{cite video|people=Bradley, Tom|year=2006|title=ITV News|medium=Television series|publisher=ITN}}</ref> On the [[Right-wing politics|right]], [[Peter Hitchens]] has written that, "Mr Cameron has abandoned the last significant difference between his party and the established left", by embracing social liberalism<ref name="Peter Hitchens">Peter Hitchens, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1666602,00.html "The Tories are doomed"], ''Guardian Unlimited'', 14 December 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> and has dubbed the party under his leadership "Blue Labour", a pun on [[New Labour]].<ref>{{cite news | title =What does it matter if we are governed by Blue Labour or New Labour?| url = http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2009/03/what-does-it-matter-if-we-are-governed-by-blue-labour-or-new-labour.html | publisher = [[The Mail on Sunday]] | date = [[2009-03-23]] | accessdate = 2009-10-14}}</ref> Cameron responded by calling Hitchens a "maniac".<ref>Peter Hitchens [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/columnists/mailonsunday.html?in_page_id=1791&in_article_id=447399&in_author_id=224 "Civilisation?

On 22 July 2007 it was reported that at least two and as many as six Conservative MPs had sent letters to Sir [[Michael Spicer]], chairman of the Conservative [[1922 Committee]], demanding a [[no confidence]] vote in Mr Cameron's leadership.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6910417.stm "Tory MPs 'seek vote on Cameron'"], ''BBC News Online'', 22 July 2007, accessed 22 July 2007</ref>

In November 2007, Cameron was criticised by Labour MP [[Hazel Blears]] for "dithering" and failing to condemn remarks made in a newspaper column by a Conservative parliamentary candidate, [[Nigel Hastilow]], claiming that [[Enoch Powell]] had been "right" about immigration.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7077934.stm "Migrant row Tory candidate quits"], ''BBC News Online'', 4 November 2007, accessed 16 November 2007</ref>

==Controversies==
===Allegations of social elitism===
''[[The Guardian]]'' has accused Cameron of relying on, "the most prestigious of old-boy networks in his attempt to return the Tories to power", pointing out that three members of his shadow cabinet and 15 members of his [[Frontbencher|front bench]] team are "[[Old Etonians]]".<ref>Matthew Taylor, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1843008,00.html "Under the Green Oak, an old elite takes root in Tories"], ''Guardian Unlimited'', 12 August 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> Similarly, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' has commented that "David Cameron has more Etonians around him than any leader since [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]]" and asked whether he can "represent Britain from such a narrow base."<ref>Robert Winnett and Holly Watt, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2394030_1,00.html "Focus: Reservoir toffs"], ''The Times Online'', 8 October 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> [[Hazel Blears]] has said of Cameron "You have to wonder about a man who surrounds himself with so many people who went to the same school. I'm pretty sure I don't want 21st-century Britain run by people who went to just one school."<ref>Greg Hurst, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-2462913,00.html "Class attack by Blears on Tories"], ''The Times Online'', 21 November 2006, accessed 28 November 2006</ref>

In a similar way, Cameron's "A-List" of prospective Parliamentary Candidates has been attacked by members of his party.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/6046668.stm "Don't ditch Tory values, MP warns"], ''BBC News Online'', 13 October 2006, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> The "A-List" policy has now been discontinued in favour of gender balanced final short lists, criticised by senior Conservative MP and Prisons Spokeswoman [[Ann Widdecombe]] as an "insult to women".<ref name="Widdecombe">Andy McSmith, "Cameron push for more female MPs 'an insult to women'", ''The Independent'', 22 August 2006.</ref>

Some supporters of the party have  criticised what they see as cronyism on the front benches, with Sir [[Tom Cowie]], working class founder of [[Arriva]] and former Conservative donor, ceasing his donations in August 2007 due to disillusionment with Cameron's leadership, saying, "the Tory party seems to be run now by Old Etonians and they don't seem to understand how other people live." In reply, Shadow Foreign Secretary [[William Hague]] said when a party was changing "there will always be people who are uncomfortable with that process".<ref>{{cite news | title = Donor condemns Cameron leadership | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6934329.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = [[2007-08-07]] | accessdate = 2007-08-24}}</ref>

===Auschwitz controversy===
In February 2008, the Conservative Party released a document entitled "Government by Gimmick", which described twenty-six announcements that it claimed "have sought to grab the headlines, but amounted to nothing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/News/News_stories/2008/02/Browns_Government_by_gimmick.aspx|title=government by gimmick|publisher=conservative party|accessdate=2009-07-20|publish date=2009-02-22}}</ref> Among the examples given was a plan to allow sixteen- to eighteen-year-old students to make memorial visits to the site of the [[Auschwitz]] concentration camp:
{{cquote|What was announced: "Two pupils from every sixth form and college in the country will be able to visit Auschwitz and learn about the Holocaust thanks to <U+00A3>4.65 million of funding" (DCSF press release, 4 February 2008)

The announcement received some criticism, with Channel Four News accusing Cameron of calling trips to Auschwitz gimmicks,<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/cameron+auschwitz+jibe+sparks+anger/1632852 Cameron Auschwitz jibe sparks anger]. ''Channel 4 News''. 22 February 2008.

Retrieved 20 May 2008.</ref>

===Apartheid controversy===
In April 2009, ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that in 1989, while [[Nelson Mandela]] remained imprisoned under the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid regime]], David Cameron had accepted a trip to [[South Africa]] paid for by an anti-sanctions lobby firm.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Cameron's freebie to apartheid South Africa
|date=2009-04-26
|author=Jane Merrick, James Hanning
|publisher=[[The Independent]]
}}</ref> A spokesperson for Cameron responded by saying that the Conservative Party was at that time opposed to [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] against South Africa and that his trip was a fact-finding mission. However, the newspaper reported that Cameron's then superior at [[Conservative Research Department]] called the trip a "jolly", saying that "it was all terribly relaxed, just a little treat, a perk of the job. The [[P.W. Botha|Botha]] regime was attempting to make itself look less horrible, but I don't regard it as having been of the faintest political consequence." The revelations were seen as a blow to Cameron, who was reported as having previously tried to distance himself from his party's history of opposing sanctions against the regime, and drew criticism from former [[cabinet minister]] [[Peter Hain]], himself an anti-apartheid campaigner, accusing Cameron of hypocrisy and comparing his behaviour with that of [[prime minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] who, Hain said, had been an active anti-apartheid campaigner at the time.

===Allegations of recreational drug use===
During the leadership election allegations were made that Cameron had used [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[cocaine]] recreationally before becoming an MP.<ref>Nicholas Lezard, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/drugs/Story/0,2763,1638897,00.html "What cocaine says about you"], ''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', 10 November 2005, accessed 6 November 2006</ref> Pressed on this point during the BBC programme ''[[Question Time (television)|Question Time]]'', Cameron expressed the view that everybody was allowed to "err and stray" in their past.<ref name="bbc-cameron-pressed-on-drugs">BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4340328.stm "Cameron pressed on drugs question "], ''[[BBC]]'', 14 October 2005, accessed 26 July 2008</ref> His refusal to deny consumption of either cannabis or cocaine prior to his parliamentary career has been interpreted as a tacit admission that he has in fact consumed both of these illegal drugs.  During his 2005 Conservative leadership campaign he addressed the question of drug consumption by remarking that "I did lots of things before I came into politics which I shouldn't have done. We all did."<ref name="bbc-cameron-pressed-on-drugs" />

===The "environmental hypocrisy"===
From the outset of his leadership of the Conservative Party, Cameron has sought to publicise his use of a bicycle to commute to work.  However, in the spring of 2006 he was photographed commuting to work on bicycle with a chauffeur-driven limousine following him carrying his belongings, and his Conservative Party spokesperson subsequently admitted that this was a regular arrangement for Cameron at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hypocrisy claim over Cameron bike |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4953922.stm |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref>  This has led to allegations of hypocrisy around any claims to "green" credentials. He was also photographed ignoring red lights and travelling in the wrong direction on a one way street.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cameron 'sorry for bike mistakes'  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7308400.stm |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=21 March 2008 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}</ref>

==Standing in opinion polls==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Amir khan Conservative.JPG|thumb|right|250px|David Cameron has recentley been making some attempts to get to know the [[British Pakistani community]].|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 25 August 2009}}]] -->

During the first month of Cameron's leadership, the Conservatives' standing in [[opinion poll]]s rose, with several pollsters putting the Conservative party ahead of the ruling Labour party. In early Spring 2006 the Conservative and Labour parties drew even, but after the May 2006 local elections various polls once again generally showed Conservative leads.<ref>[http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/voting-intention/ "Current voting intention"], ''UKPollingReport.co.uk''.</ref> One poll for ''[[The Independent]]'' in April 2007 showed Labour falling to 27% and the Conservatives rising one point to 36%, widening the Conservative lead again to nine-points.<ref>Andrew Grice, [http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article2481035.ece "Labour slumps to lowest poll rating since 1983"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 April 2007, accessed 24 April 2007</ref>

Following Gordon Brown's ascending to the premiership on 27 June 2007, Labour experienced an increase in their poll ratings, taking them ahead of the Conservatives. Although the Conservatives dismissed this phenomenon as a short-term "Brown bounce", Labour's poll ratings continued to grow steadily at Cameron's expense: an ICM poll<ref>Patrick Hennessy and Melissa Kite [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/07/15/nbrown115.xml "Gordon Brown has biggest lead over Tories"] ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', 15 July 2007</ref> on 15 July 2007 had Labour rating at 40% and the Conservatives at 33%, in the wake of controversies over Cameron's policies on grammar schools and museum fees and his proposals for marriage tax incentives.

An ICM poll<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,2172186,00.html "The swing against Cameron"] ''The Guardian'', 19 September 2007</ref> on 19 September 2007 found not only that Labour were leading the Conservative by eight-points (40% to 32%), but that Cameron was now rated as the least popular of the three main party leaders (behind Gordon Brown and Sir Menzies Campbell). A YouGov poll for Channel 4<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianpolitics/story/0,,2177033,00.html "Ratings boost for Brown as defection talk rattles Tories"] ''The Guardian'', 26 September 2007</ref> one week later (and after the Labour Party conference) extended Brown's lead to 11-points, enough to secure a three-figure parliamentary majority, prompting further speculation about an early election. After the Conservative Party conference in the first week of October 2007, ''The Guardian'' reported that the Conservatives had drawn level with Labour on 38% each.<ref>[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/polls/story/0,,2184122,00.html "Cameron bounces back"] ''The Guardian'', 5 October 2007</ref>

On 6 October, Gordon Brown declared he would not call an election for Autumn 2007 despite weeks of speculation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7031749.stm "Brown rules out autumn election"] ''BBC News'', 6 October 2007</ref> This reversal was the start of a decline in Brown's and the Labour party's standings in the polls, made worse by the [[Northern Rock#2007 Credit Crisis|Northern Rock Banking crisis]], the loss of 25 million child benefit records, and scandals centred on political donations ("[[Donorgate]]") involving [[David Abrahams (Labour party donor)|David Abrahams]], [[Harriet Harman]] and [[Peter Hain]]. During November a series of polls showed improved support for the Conservatives so that on 2 December, an ICM poll<ref>[http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/0212_tories_high.shtml "Tories 15-yr high"] ''News of the World'', 2 December 2007</ref> gave the Conservatives an 11 point lead over Labour (41% to 30%). This lead decreased in 2008 during the Second Reading of the Bill ratifying the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]; on 26 January a poll found Conservative support had fallen three points to 37%, only two points ahead of Labour, which was up one point at 35%, the highest since October 2007.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/eu/story/0,,2247318,00.html "Happy in Europe but still best friends with the US"] ''The Guardian'', 26 January 2008</ref> By March 2008, following [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Alistair Darling]]'s release of the annual Budget, a YouGov survey on behalf of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Conservatives had their largest lead in opinion polls since October 1987 with a 16 point lead over Labour (43% to 27%).<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article3559480.ece "Support for Labour hits 25-year low"], ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 16 March 2008.</ref> In May 2008, following the worst local election performance from the Labour Party in 40 years, a YouGov survey on behalf of ''[[The Sun]]'' showed the Conservatives' lead had increased to 26 points (49% to 23%), its largest lead since 1968, with Labour support at its lowest ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/Sun%2008%2005%2008%20toplines.pdf|title =You gov, sun survey results}}</ref> In December 2008, a ComRes showed the Conservatives' lead had decreased to 1 point (37% to 36%),<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/1715 ''Voting Intention]'' 3 December 2008]</ref> though by February it had risen to around 12 points.<ref>{{cite web

==Personal life==
Cameron married [[Samantha Cameron|Samantha Gwendoline Sheffield]], the daughter of Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield, 8th Baronet and Annabel Lucy Veronica Jones (now the [[Annabel Astor, Viscountess Astor|Viscountess Astor]]), on 1 June 1996 at Ginge Manor in Oxfordshire. The Camerons had three children. Their first child, Ivan Reginald Ian, was born on 8 April 2002 in [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]], [[London]],<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Births England and Wales 1984-2006]</ref> with a rare combination of [[cerebral palsy]] and a form of severe [[epilepsy]] called [[Ohtahara syndrome]], requiring round-the-clock care. Recalling the receipt of this news, Cameron is quoted as saying: "The news hits you like a [[freight train]]... You are depressed for a while because you are grieving for the difference between your hopes and the reality. But then you get over that, because he's wonderful!"<ref name="Focus">Quoted in "Focus: Can Boy Wonder save the Tories?", ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 9 October 2005</ref> Ivan died at [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]], [[Paddington]], London, in the early hours of 25 February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7909562.stm|title=Cameron's eldest son Ivan dies |date=25 February 2009|accessdate=25 February 2009|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref>

A ''[[Daily Mail]]'' article from June 2007 quoted ''[[Sunday Times Rich List]]'' compiler [[Philip Beresford]], who had valued the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader for the first time, as saying: "I put the combined family wealth of David and Samantha Cameron at <U+00A3>30m plus.
