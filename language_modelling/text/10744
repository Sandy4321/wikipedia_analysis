'''Lockdown (2005)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|event]] produced by the [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], which took place on April&nbsp;24, 2005, at the [[Impact Wrestling Zone|TNA Impact! Zone]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. It was the first event under the [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] chronology and the fourth event in the 2005 TNA PPV schedule. Eight [[mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] and one pre-show match were featured on the event's [[card (sports)|card]]. Every match took place inside a six sided steel structure known as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Six Sides of Steel]]. As a result, Lockdown was the first-ever all steel cage event held in professional wrestling. 

The main event was for a [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] match at TNA's [[Hard Justice (2005)|Hard Justice]] PPV event between [[A.J. Styles]] and [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]]. Styles won the match, thus earning his title shot against then-champion [[Jeff Jarrett]] at Hard Justice. TNA held the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Lethal Lockdown|Lethal Lockdown match]] during the event. It pitted Team [[Kevin Nash|Nash]] ([[Diamond Dallas Page]], [[Sean Waltman]], and [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]]) against [[Planet Jarrett|Team Jarrett]] (Jeff Jarrett, [[Monty Brown]], and [[Monty Sopp|The Outlaw]]), which Team Nash won. [[Kevin Nash]] was originally supposed to take part in the match but was removed due to sickness and was replaced with James. The [[TNA X Division Championship]] defense by [[Christopher Daniels]] against [[Elix Skipper]] was another highly promoted match for the event. Daniels won the bout and successfully retained the title. [[Jeff Hardy]] versus [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] in a Six Sides of Steel [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|Tables match]] was featured on the card, which Hardy won.

This event marked the introduction of the Lethal Lockdown and Xscape matches, which became annually held matches at future Lockdown events. During the event, [[Chris Candido]] received an injury during his tag team match with [[Lance Hoyt]] against [[Germ<U+00E1>n Figueroa|Apolo]] and [[Sonny Siaki]], which later led to Candido's death from a blood clot as a result of surgery for the injury. Jason Clevett of the professional wrestling section of the [[Canadian Online Explorer]] rated the event a 6 out of 10, two marks lower than the [[Lockdown (2006)|2006 event's]] ranking by Chris Sokol.

===Storylines===
{{See also|Professional wrestling}}
Lockdown featured eight professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]], [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]], or [[Tweener (professional wrestling)|less distinguishable characters]] in the scripted events that built tension and that culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. Every match was contested inside the Six Sides of Steel.

===Preliminary matches===

The show opened with a Six Sides of Steel Tag Team Cage match that pitted the team of [[Germ<U+00E1>n Figueroa|Apolo]] and [[Sonny Siaki]] against Chris Candido and Lance Hoyt, which lasted 6 minutes and 58 seconds. This was originally promoted as a bout between Hoyt and Apolo but was changed at the event. During the opening minutes, Candido suffered a bad fall and was helped to the backstage area. Siaki and Apolo won the contest after Siaki performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|splash]] from the top of a padded [[turnbuckle]] on Hoyt.<ref name="PWTorchLD">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_12927.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Lockdown PPV report 4/24: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of live event|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=2005-04-24|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=2011-07-19}}</ref>

[[Dustin Rhodes]] fought [[Robert Roode|Bobby Roode]], who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore and A-1, in what was billed as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Two out of three falls match|Prince of Darkness match]] next. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 20 seconds. In this contest, there would be three falls, but the third fall would be contested under [[Professional wrestling match types#Blindfold match|blindfold match rules]], in which both wrestlers wore hoods over their heads. Roode earned the first fall with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up pin]], and Dustin earned the second one when he [[Professional wrestling throws#Bulldog|forced Roode face-first]] into the mat from the top rope. During the third fall, both wrestlers wore black hoods that impaired their vision, causing Dustin to accidentally knock the referee unconscious in storyline terms. Due to this, D'Amore opened the cage door and passed Roode a steel [[folding chair]]. Roode then attempted to bash Dustin with it but instead mistakenly struck D'Amore. Dustin then grabbed the chair and struck Roode with it, which gave him the pinfall as the referee came to.<ref name="SLAMLD05"/>

TNA held the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Xscape Match|Xscape match]] between [[Shocker (wrestler)|Shocker]], Michael Shane (who was accompanied Trinity), [[Sonjay Dutt]], and Chris Sabin in the following bout. It lasted 15 minutes and 42 seconds. In this match, the four competitors fought until two were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers then fought to escape from the cage, with the first to do so the winner. Dutt was the first wrestler eliminated after Shocker slammed him into the steel cage. After this elimination, Trinity climbed up to the top of the cage and performed a [[Moonsault|backflip]] off the top onto the three wrestlers below. Traci then entered the arena and forced Trinity to the backstage area. The second eliminated was Shane, after Sabin forced him back-first into the mat with his signature maneuver the [[Professional wrestling throws#Samoan driver|Cradle Shock]]. Sabin and Shocker remained as they both fought to escape the cage, which Shocker did first to win the contest.<ref name="PWTorchLD"/>

The fourth encounter was a Six Sides of Steel Tables match between Jeff Hardy and Raven, which lasted 11 minutes and 51 seconds. In a tables match, two opponents fight until one is forced through a table by the other. At one point during the contest, Hardy laid Raven on a table then ascended to the top of the cage. Hardy followed by jumping off and performing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#High-angle senton bomb|front-flip]] towards Raven, who moved out of the way and caused Hardy to crash through the table. Due to not being forced through by Raven, the match continued until Hardy laid Raven on a stack of four tables. Hardy then jumped off the top of the cage onto [[Leg drop|Raven in a seated position]], forcing him through all the tables and winning the encounter.<ref name="WVLD05"/>

America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) defended the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] against [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] ([[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] and Petey Williams), who were accompanied by A-1, in a Six Sides of Steel [[Professional wrestling match types#Strap match|Strap match]] next. It lasted 14 minutes even. In a strap match, wrestlers are attached by a strap for the duration of the match, but they mainly used it as a weapon. AMW retained the titles after forcing Williams into the mat by performing their signature maneuver, the [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Bearhug hold, top-rope legdrop combination|Death Sentence]].<ref name="PWTorchLD"/>

===Main event matches===
[[File:AJ Styles in London Sep 2008.jpg|left|200px|thumb|alt=A white male standing with his mouth open in the darkness with a spotlight on him|[[A.J. Styles]] defeated [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] for a future [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] match at Lockdown.]]
The TNA X Division Championship was defended in a bout that lasted 15 minutes and 28 seconds between then-champion Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper. During the encounter, Daniels performed his signature backflip, the [[Moonsault#Double jump moonsault|Best Moonsault Ever]], on Skipper, which earned him a near-fall. Skipper later jumped off the top of the cage and bashed Daniels in the back of the head [[Professional wrestling attacks#Flying forearm smash|with his forearm]]. This also gained Skipper a near-fall. Daniels went on to perform his signature maneuver, the [[Facebuster#Lifting_double_underhook_facebuster|Angel Wings]], on Skipper, which forced him face-first into the mat and allowed him to gain the pinfall and to retain the title.<ref name="SLAMLD05"/>

Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and an unknown member) fought Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw) in the first-ever three-on-three Lethal Lockdown match, which ran 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Waltman and Jarrett started the match by fighting through the crowd before entering the cage. After five minutes, The Outlaw joined the match and helped Jarrett attack Waltman. Diamond Dallas Page entered the match two minutes later and attacked Jarrett and The Outlaw with a [[cane]]. Following another two minutes, Brown joined the fray, finished out Team Jarrett, and [[Suplex#Belly to belly suplex|threw Waltman into the cage wall]]. The final member of Team Nash was revealed after the final two minutes, as [[Brian Gerard James|B.G. James]] was thrown into the mix that allowed a pinfall or submission to occur. Brown gained a near-fall for Team Jarrett on James after forcing him into a [[trash can]] with his signature maneuver, the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Shoulder block|Pounce]]. Eventually, Waltman performed a move called a [[Professional wrestling throws#Hurricanrana|hurricanrana]] on Brown, leading to the pinfall and victory.<ref name="SLAMLD05"/>

The main event was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, in which the winner received an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Senton bomb|front-flip onto Abyss]], who was standing in the doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of [[thumbtacks]] onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the tacks instead with his signature maneuver, the [[Facebuster#Belly-to-back_inverted_mat_slam|Styles Clash]]. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss [[Chokeslam|grabbed and threw the referee]] into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a [[Powerbomb#Sunset flip powerbomb|sunset flip powerbomb]] and slammed Abyss into the tacks back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.<ref name="WVLD05"/>

He went on to state that by the end of the event he "was tired of seeing the cage", but that Styles and Abyss "quickly brought my interest back with a brutal and fun bout that ended off the show on a positive note". When speaking of the TNA X Division Championship match, Clevett wrote that he felt it "was technically a very good match", but he "expected more considering the talent involved". However, he felt that the psychological aspect was "excellent" regrading the two former Triple X partners' counters of each other's moves. Clevett gave the highest match rating of 8.5 out of 10 to the main event, while he gave the lowest rating of 2 out of 10 to the Prince of Darkness match.

He gave the lowest ranking to the Prince of Darkness match, at a fourth of a star. Keller commented on the main event as not being "bad at all, but not quite at a four-star level". He felt that if there had not been "any other cage matches or stunt bumps, it might have been four-stars-plus". Regrading the Lethal Lockdown match, Keller believed the bout "felt rushed". As for the X Division Championship defense, Keller stated that it was a "good match". When speaking on Candido's injury, Keller stated it was "absolutely brutal looking" and felt it was an "obvious full snapping of his ankle bone".<ref name="PWTorchLD"/> 411Mania's Ronnie LaFianza rated Lockdown an overall 8 out of 10. The main event was given 4 and three-fourths stars out of 5, the Lethal Lockdown match 2 and a half stars, and the X Division Championship defense 3 and a half stars.
