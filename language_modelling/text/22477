There is a small community of '''Armenians in Ethiopia''', primarily in the [[Ethiopia]]n capital [[Addis Ababa]].

==Religion==
The Armenian presence in Ethiopia is historic. On a religious basis, the Ethiopian Church and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] are both members of the [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] communion of churches alongside [[Coptic Orthodox]], [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Eritrean Orthodox]] and [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]] (India) churches.

The Armenian inhabitants in Ethiopia are Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox Armenians) belonging to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

The Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) have their own church, Sourp Kevork (St. George) Armenian Apostolic Church in [[Adis Ababa]].

The first-ever pastor of the Armenian community was Rev. Hovhannes Guevherian.

==History==
Besides the obvious religious affiliation, there is also the story of the [[Arba Lijoch]] children coming to Ethiopia after the [[Armenian Genocide]]. "Arba Lijoch" were a group of 40 Armenian [[orphan]]s who had escaped from the atrocities in [[Turkey]], and were afterwards adopted by [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]], then [[Crown Prince]] [[Ras (title)|Ras]] Tafari. He had met them while visiting the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] [[monastery]] in [[Jerusalem]]. They impressed him so much that he obtained permission from the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] to adopt and bring them to [[Ethiopia]], where he then arranged for them to receive musical instruction. 

The Arba Lijoch arrived in [[Addis Ababa]] in 1924, and along with their bandleader Kevork Nalbandian became the first official orchestra of the nation. Nalbandian also composed the music for ''[[Marsh Teferi]]'' (words by [[Yofteh<U+00E9> Negus<U+00E9>]]), which was the Imperial National Anthem from 1930 to 1974.
