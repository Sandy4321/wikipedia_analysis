{{main|History of Greece}}

Greece was the first area in Europe where advanced early civilizations emerged, beginning with the [[Minoan civilization]] in Crete and then the [[Mycenae|Mycenean]] civilization on the mainland. Later, [[city-states]] emerged across the Greek peninsula and spread to the shores of [[Black Sea]], [[Magna Grecia|South Italy]] and [[Asia Minor]] reaching great levels of [[wealth|prosperity]] that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, expressed in [[Parthenon|architecture]], [[drama]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]], and nurtured in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] under a [[Democracy|democratic]] environment. [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] led the way in repelling the [[Persian Empire]] in a series of [[Greco-Persian Wars|battles]]. Both were later overshadowed by [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and eventually [[Macedon]], with the latter under the guidance of [[Alexander the Great]] uniting and leading the Greek world to victory over the [[Persians]], to presage the [[Hellenistic era]], itself brought only partially to a close two centuries later with the establishment of [[Roman Republic|Roman]] rule over Greek lands in 146 BC.

The subsequent mixture of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Hellenic cultures took form in the establishment of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 330 AD around [[Constantinople]], which remained a major cultural and military power for the next 1,123 years,  until [[Fall of Constantinople|its fall]] at the hands of [[Byzantine<U+2013>Ottoman Wars|Ottomans]] in 1453. On the eve of the Ottoman era the Greek intelligentsia migrated to [[Western Europe]], playing a significant role in the [[Renaissance|Western European Renaissance]] through the transferring of works of [[Ancient Greeks]] to [[Western Europe]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displaystory.cfm?story_id=346800 |title=Millennium issue: Trouble with Turkey The fall of Constantinople Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=1997-03-20 |accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref> Nevertheless, the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millet]] system contributed to the cohesion of the Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the [[Ottoman Empire]] based on religion, as the latter played an integral role in the formation of modern Greek identity.

After the [[Greek War of Independence]], successfully fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1821 to 1829, the nascent Greek state was finally recognized under the [[London Protocol]]. In 1827, [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], a noble Greek from the [[Ionian Islands]], was chosen as the first governor of the new Republic. However, following his assassination, the [[Great Powers]] soon installed a [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] under [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], of the Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach]]. In 1843, an uprising forced the King to grant a constitution and a representative assembly. Due to his unimpaired authoritarian rule, he was eventually dethroned in 1863 and replaced by Prince Vilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name [[George I of Greece|George I]] and brought with him the [[Ionian Islands]] as a coronation gift from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1877, [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], a dominant figure of the Greek political scene who is attributed with the significant improvement of the country's infrastructure, curbed the power of the monarchy to interfere in the assembly by issuing the rule of [[vote of confidence]] to any potential [[prime minister]].

As  a result of the [[Balkan Wars]], Greece successfully increased the extent of her territory and population, a challenging context both socially and economically. In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic prime minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over the country's foreign policy on the eve of [[World War I]] dominated the country's political scene, and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposed groups]].

In the aftermath of WW I, Greece [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|fought]] against Turkish nationalists led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Mustafa Kemal]], a war which resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. Instability and successive [[coup d'etat|coups d'etat]] marked the following era, which was overshadowed by the massive task of incorporating 1.5 million [[Greek refugees]] from Asia Minor into Greek society. On 28 October 1940 Fascist [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but Greek dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]] refused and in the following [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into [[Albania]], giving the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] their first victory over [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on land. The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the [[Battle of Greece]]. The German occupiers nevertheless met serious challenges from the [[Greek Resistance]].

After liberation, Greece experienced a bitter [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between [[Monarchism|Royalist]] and [[Communist]] forces, which led to economic devastation and severe social tensions between its [[Rightists]] and largely Communist [[Leftists]] for the next 30 years.<ref>Mazower, Mark. ''After the War was Over''</ref> The next 20 years were characterized by marginalisation of the left in the political and social spheres but also by a significant economic growth, propelled in part by the [[Marshall Plan]].

In 1965, a period of political turbulence led to a coup d<U+2019>etat on 21 April 1967 by the US-backed [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Regime of the Colonels]]. On November 1973 the [[Athens Polytechnic Uprising]] sent shock waves across the regime, and a counter-coup established [[Brigadier]] [[Dimitrios Ioannides]] as dictator. On 20 July 1974, as [[Turkey]] [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded]] the island of [[Cyprus]], the regime collapsed.

Former premier [[Constantine Karamanlis]] was invited back from [[Paris]] where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the [[Metapolitefsi]] era. On the 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of NATO in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.<ref name="autogenerated2">History, Editorial Consultant : Adam Hart-Davis, Dorling Kindersley Limited publisher, ISBN : 978 1 8561 3062 2</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/update/70-79/1974e.htm |title=NATO Update 1974 |publisher=Nato.int |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> In 1975 a democratic republican constitution was activated and the monarchy abolished by a referendum held that same year. Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]] founded the Panhellenic Socialist Party, or [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]], in response to [[Constantine Karamanlis]]' [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations dominating Greek political affairs in the ensuing decades. Greece rejoined [[NATO]] in 1980.<ref name="autogenerated2" /> Relations with neighbouring Turkey have improved substantially over the last decade, since successive earthquakes hit both nations in the summer of 1999 (see [[Greek-Turkish earthquake diplomacy|Greece-Turkey earthquake diplomacy]]), and today Athens is an active supporter of Turkey's bid for EU membership.

Greece became the tenth member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1981, and ever since  the nation has experienced a remarkable and sustained economic growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast growing service sector have raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. The country adopted the [[Euro]] in 2001 and successfully organised the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]].

===Political Parties===
{{main|Political parties of Greece}}

Since the restoration of democracy, the Greek [[two-party system]] is dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK).<ref>For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system see T. Pappas, ''Transformation of the Greek Party System Since 1951'', 90-114, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).</ref> Other significant parties include the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) and the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] (LAOS). The current prime minister is [[Kostas Karamanlis]], president of the New Democracy party and nephew of the late [[Constantine Karamanlis]], who won a second term on 16 September 2007, acquiring a slimmer majority in the Parliament with only 152 out of 300 seats.

[[Image:Greece meteora monasteries.JPG|thumb|230px|View of the [[Meteora]] in central Greece.]]
Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the [[Balkans]], the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesus]] peninsula (separated from the mainland by the [[Corinth Canal|canal]] of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]), and [[Greek islands|numerous islands]] (1400, 227 of which are inhabited), including [[Crete]], [[Euboea]], [[Lesbos Island|Lesbos]], [[Chios]], the [[Dodecanese]] and the [[Cyclades|Cycladic]] groups of the [[Aegean Sea]] as well as the [[Ionian Sea]] islands. Greece has the [[List of countries by length of coastline|tenth longest coastline]] in the world with {{convert|14880|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}; its land boundary is {{convert|1160|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

Four fifths of Greece consist of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe.  [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]], a focal point of Greek culture throughout history culminates at Mytikas peak {{convert|2917|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the highest in the country.  Once considered the throne of the Gods, it is today extremely popular among hikers and climbers.  Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range.  The Pindus reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|2637|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at Mt. Smolikas and is essentially a prolongation of the [[Dinaric Alps]].  The Vikos-Aoos Gorge is yet another spectacular formation and a popular hotspot for those fond of extreme sports. 

The range continues through the central [[Peloponnese]], crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and find its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of [[Crete]] where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. Most notably, the impressive [[Meteora]] formation consisting of high, steep boulders provides a breathtaking experience for the hundreds of thousands of tourists who visit the area each year.

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the Rhodope range, spreading across the periphery of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests. The famous Dadia forest is in the prefecture of [[Evros Prefecture|Evros]], in the far northeast of the country.

Expansive plains are primarily located in the prefectures of [[Thessaly]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country.  Rare marine species such as the Pinniped Seals and the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered [[brown bear]], the [[lynx]], the [[Roe Deer]] and the Wild Goat.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greece belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]], Rodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and Crete Mediterranean forests.

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Greece}}

The climate of Greece can be categorised into three types (the Mediterranean, the Alpine and the Temperate) that influence well-defined regions of its territory. The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country by making the western side of it (areas prone to the south-westerlies) wetter on average than the areas lying to the east of it ([[lee side]] of the mountains). The Mediterranean type of climate features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The Cyclades, the [[Dodecanese]], [[Crete]], Eastern Peloponessus and parts of the Sterea Ellada region are mostly affected by this particular type of climate. Temperatures rarely reach extreme values along the coasts, although, with Greece being a highly mountainous country, snowfalls occur frequently in winter. It sometimes snows even in the [[Cyclades]] or the [[Dodecanese]].

The Alpine type is dominant mainly in the mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece ([[Epirus (periphery)|Epirus]], [[Central Greece]], [[Thessaly]], [[Western Macedonia]]) as well as in the central parts of [[Peloponnese]], including the prefectures of [[Achaia]], [[Arcadia]] and parts of [[Laconia]], where extensions of the Pindus mountain range pass by. Finally, the Temperate type affects [[Central Macedonia]] and [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; it features cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers. Athens is located in a transitional area featuring both the Mediterranean and the Temperate types. The city's northern suburbs are dominated by the temperate type while the downtown area and the southern suburbs enjoy a typical Mediterranean type.

==Economy==
[[Image:GreeceEconomyGDPEnglish.png|thumb|GDP Growth of Greece compared to the Eurozone between 1996 - 2006.]]
{{main|Economy of Greece|}}

After World War II, Greece experienced the "[[Greek economic miracle]]"; GDP growth averaged 7% between 1950 and 1973. Since then Greece has implemented of a number of structural and fiscal reforms while receiving considerable European Union funding. In 2001, Greece joined the [[Eurozone|Economic and Monetary Union]]. Annual growth of Greek GDP has surpassed the respective levels of most of its [[EU]] partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elke.gr/default.asp?V_DOC_ID=765 |title=ELKE Hellenic Center for Investment - Economic Stability |publisher=Elke.gr |date= |accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref> Today, the [[Tertiary sector of economic activity|service industry]] makes up the largest, most vital and fastest-growing sector of the Greek economy, followed by industry and agriculture.<ref name="ciaecon">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gr.html|title=Greece}}</ref> The tourism industry is a major source of foreign exchange earnings and revenue accounting for 15% of Greece<U+2019>s total GDP<ref name="ciaecon" /> and employing ,directly or indirectly, 16.5% of the total workforce.

Greece is a leading investor in all of her Balkan neighbors with the [[National Bank of Greece]] in 2006 acquiring the 46% of Turkish [[Finansbank]] and 99.44% of Serbia's [[Vojvo<U+0111>anska Bank]].The manufacturing sector accounts for about 13% of GDP with the food industry leading in growth, profit and export potential. The public sector accounts for about 40% of GDP, with the government however taking measures to decrease it further. High-technology equipment production, especially for telecommunications, is also a fast-growing sector. Other important areas include textiles, building materials, machinery, transport equipment, and electrical appliances. At 10% of GDP, construction is one of the main pillars of the economy, with the sector experiencing a boom due to the Athens Olympics of 2004. Agriculture, at 7%, is the final important sector of Greek economic activity.
The Greek labor force totals 4.9 million, and it is the second most industrious between [[OECD]] countries, after [[South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by internetakias |url=http://internetakias.gr/2008/05/28/greece-second-hardest-working/ |title=<U+039F><U+03B9> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2> 2<U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+03C0><U+03B9><U+03BF> <U+03C3><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C1><U+03AC> <U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03B6><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BD> <U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03BF>! |publisher=Internetakias.gr |date= |accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref> The [[University of Groningen|Groningen Growth & Development Centre]] has published a poll revealing that between 1995 - 2005, Greece was the country with the largest work/hour ratio among European nations; Greeks worked an average of 1,900 hours per year, followed by the Spanish (average of 1,800 hours/year).<ref>{{cite news|author=e-go.gr , Pegasus Interactive |url=http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=12128&subid=2&tag=8784&pubid=1114536 |title=v4.ethnos.gr - O<U+03B9> <U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B5><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> E<U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BD> - <U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C2>, <U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B1>, <U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B5><U+03C2> <U+03B4><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03B5><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03C2> |publisher=Ethnos.gr |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref> In 2007, the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per hour worked|average worker made around 20 dollars]], similar to Spain and slightly more than half of average U.S. hourly income.

[[Internet cafes]] that provide net access, office applications and multiplayer gaming are also a common sight in the country, while mobile internet on [[3G]] cellphone networks and public wi-fi hotspots are existent, but not as extensive.

Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as [[Ericsson]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Motorola]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have their regional R&D Headquarters in Greece.

The [http://www.gsrt.gr/default.asp?V_LANG_ID=2, General Secretariat for Research and Technology] of the [http://www.ypan.gr/index_uk_c_cms.htm Hellenic Ministry of Development] is responsible for designing, implementing and supervising national research and technological policy.

In 2003, public spending on R&D was 456.37 million euros (12.6% increase from 2002). Total research and development (R&D) spending (both public and private) as a percentage of GDP has increased considerably since the beginning of the past decade, from 0.38% in 1989, to 0.65% in 2001. R&D spending in Greece remains lower than the EU average of 1.93%, but, according to Research DC, based on OECD and Eurostat data, between 1990 and 1998, total R&D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third highest increase in Europe, after Finland and Ireland.

As member of the ESA, Greece participates in the agency's telecommunication and technology activities, and the [[Global Monitoring for Environment and Security]] Initiative.

===Tourism===

An important percentage of Greece's income comes from tourism. In 2004 Greece welcomed 16.5 million tourists. According to a survey conducted in [[China]] in 2005, Greece was voted as the Chinese people's number one choice as a tourist destination,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=5623408&postcount=1 |title=View Single Post - Thank you China!

The island of [[Rhodes]] was announced the best European tourist destination. Other famous tourist hotspots include the capital [[Athens]], the northern [[Chalkidiki]] peninsula, the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] island of [[Corfu]] and the island resorts of [[Myconos]], [[Santorini]], [[Paros]] and [[Crete]].

===International relations===
Greece is a major participant in most large scale international bodies, with the geographic significance of the region proving advantageous for diplomatic, trade and political crossroads.

{{main|Greek euro coins}}
{{Seealso|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)}}

In Greece, the [[euro]] was introduced in 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001, however all Greek euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin.  Eight different designs, one per face value, was selected for the Greek coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Greece changed the common side of their coins.  Before adopting the Euro in 2002 Greece had maintained use of the [[Greek drachma]] from 1832.

Greece has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 200 euro, mainly issued to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics.  These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins.  Unlike normal issues, these coins are not legal tender in all the eurozone. For instance, a <U+20AC>10 Greek commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.

==Transport==
[[Image:BrugPatras.JPG|thumb|The [[Rio-Antirio bridge]] near the city of [[Patras]] is the longest [[cable-stayed bridge]] in Europe and second in the world.]]
{{main|Transport in Greece}}

Since the 1980s, the roads and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernised. Important works include the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia highway]] that connects north west Greece ([[Igoumenitsa]]) with northern and north west Greece. The [[Rio-Antirio bridge]] (the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe) (2250 m long) connects the western [[Peloponnesus]] from [[Rio, Greece|Rio]] (7&nbsp;km from [[Patras]]) with [[Antirion]] on the central Greek mainland. An expansion of the Patras-Athens national motorway towards [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]] in the western Peloponnese is scheduled to be completed by 2014. Most of the highway connection of Athens to Thessaloniki has also been upgraded.

The metropolitan area of the capital Athens had a new [[Athens International Airport|international airport]] (opened in 2001), a new privately run suburban motorway [[Attiki Odos]] (opened 2001), and an expanded [[Athens metro|metro system]] (since 2000).

Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connecting by air mainly from the two major airlines of Greece, Olympic and Aegean air. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]]. Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role than in many other European countries, but railways too have been expanded, with new suburban connections around Athens, a modern intercity connection between Athens and Thessaloniki, and upgrading to double lines in many parts of the 2500&nbsp;km network. International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the [[Balkans]] and [[Turkey]].

The official Statistical body of Greece is the [[National Statistical Service of Greece]] (NSSG). According to the NSSG, Greece's total population in 2001 was 10,964,020.<ref name=nssg>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf |title=Greece in Numbers |work=National Statistical Service of Greece |publisher=www.statistis.gr |year=2006 |accessdate=2007-12-14|format=PDF}}</ref> That figure is divided into 5,427,682 males and 5,536,338 females.<ref name=nssg/> As statistics from 1971, 1981, and 2001 show, the Greek population has been aging the past several decades.<ref name=nssg/> The birth rate in 2003 stood 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (14.5 per 1,000 in 1981). At the same time the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. In 2001, 16.71% of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12% between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18% were 14 years old and younger.<ref name=nssg/> Greek society has also rapidly changed with the passage of time. Marriage rates kept falling from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004.<ref name=nssg/> Divorce rates on the other hand, have seen an increase <U+2013> from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.<ref name=nssg/> Almost two-thirds of the [[Greeks|Greek people]] live in urban areas. Greece's largest municipalities in 2001 were: [[Athens]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Piraeus]], [[Patras]], [[Iraklio]], [[Larissa]], and [[Volos]].<ref name=cities>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/Athena2001/Athena2001.ASP?wcu=$cmd=0$id=5200712142356520314915 |title=Athena 2001 Census |work=National Statistical Service of Greece |accessdate=2007-12-14 |publisher=www.statistics.gr}}</ref>

Throughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks had migrated to the US, UK, Australia and Germany, creating a thriving [[Greek diaspora]] that accounts today almost 6 million people. The migration trend however was reversed after the important improvements of Greek economy since the 80's.

===Immigration===
Due to the complexity of Greek immigration policy, practices and data collection, truly reliable data on [[Immigration to Greece|immigrant populations]] in Greece is difficult to gather and therefore subject to much speculation. A study from the [http://www.mmo.gr Mediterranean Migration Observatory] maintains that the 2001 Census from the NSSG recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of total population and that, of these, 48,560 were EU or [[EFTA]] nationals and 17,426 Cypriots with privileged status. People from the Balkan countries of Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania make up almost two-thirds of the total foreign population. Migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldava, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.<ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=228 Greece: A History of Migration], Migration Information Source</ref>

The greatest cluster of non-EU immigrant population is in the Municipality of Athens <U+2013>some 132,000 immigrants, at 17% of local population. Thessaloniki is the second largest cluster, with 27,000, reaching 7% of local population. After this, the predominant areas of location are the big cities environs and the agricultural areas. At the same time, [[Albanians]] constituted some 56% of total immigrants, followed by [[Bulgarians]] (5%), [[Georgians]] (3%) and [[Romanians]] (3%). Americans, Cypriots, British and Germans appeared as sizeable foreign communities at around 2% each of total foreign population. The rest were around 690,000 persons of non-EU or non-homogeneis (of non-Greek heritage) status.

According to the same study, the foreign population (documented and undocumented) residing in Greece may in reality figure upwards to 8.5% or 10.3%, that is approximately meaning 1.15 million - if immigrants with ''homogeneis'' cards are accounted for.

===Religion===

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Greece|Minorities in Greece}}

Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using [[Greek language|Greek]] as their first or only language. The [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks|Pomak]]) and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country.

Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountaneous central Greece. Members of these groups ethnically identfiy as Greeks<ref>[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&serial=1044526702223 Greek Helsinki Monitor], Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) 8 September 1999 </ref> and are today all at least bilingual in Greek. In many areas their traditional languages are today only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction.

Near the northern Greek borders there are also some [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-speaking groups, whose members identify ethnically as Greeks in their majority. Their dialects can be linguistically classified as forms of either [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (locally called ''Slavomacedonian'' or simply ''Slavic''), or [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (distinguished as ''Pomak'' in the case of the Bulgarophone Muslims of Thrace.<ref>P. Trudgill, "Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity", in S Barbour, C Carmichael (eds.), ''Language and nationalism in Europe'', Oxford University Press 2000.</ref>

The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained only by a small group of a few thousand speakers.

Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Pontic Greek genocide|Pontic Greek Genocide]] and constitute a sizable group.

As they can accept both ''Gymnasio'' (lower secondary school) and ''Lykeio'' (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.

Public higher education is divided into [[University|universities]], "Highest Educational Institutions" (<U+0391><U+03BD><U+03CE><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1> <U+0395><U+03BA><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AC> <U+0399><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03CD><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1>, ''An<U+00F3>tata Ekpaideytik<U+00E1> Idr<U+00FD>mata'', "<U+0391><U+0395><U+0399>") and "Highest Technological Educational Institutions" (<U+0391><U+03BD><U+03CE><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1> <U+03A4><U+03B5><U+03C7><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AC> <U+0395><U+03BA><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03B4><U+03B5><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AC> <U+0399><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03CD><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B1>, ''An<U+00F3>tata Technologik<U+00E1> Ekpaideytik<U+00E1> Idr<U+00FD>mata'', "ATEI"). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery. The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian university of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. Specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological and physical education also exist.

Some of the main universities in Greece include:

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Greece|List of Greeks}}

[[Image:GreekSalad.jpg|thumb|130px|[[Greek salad]] with additional ingredients.]]

The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, with its beginnings in [[Mycenaean Greece|the Mycenaean and Minoan Civilizations]], continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], the [[Hellenistic Period]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Ottoman Empire]] too had a significant influence on Greek culture, but the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek war of independence]] is credited with revitalizing Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi-faceted culture throughout the ages.

===Philosophy===
{{main|Greek Philosophy|Greek Literature}}

Most western philosophical traditions began in ancient Greece in the 6th century bc. The first philosophers are called "[[Presocratics]]" which designates that they came before [[Socrates]]. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern regions of the Greece and only fragments of the original writings of the presocratics survive, in some cases merely a single sentence. A new period of philosophy started with Socrates the [[Athenian]], like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system. [[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]] the most important disciple of Plato shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity but while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/greekphi.htm  |title=Greek philosophy from the Internet encyclopedia of philosophy}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{main|Greek cuisine}}

[[Greek cuisine]] is often cited as an example of the healthy [[Mediterranean diet]]. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[stifado]], [[Greek Salad]], [[spanakopita]] and the world famous [[Souvlaki]]. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick pur<U+00E9>e of potatoes, walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or ros<U+00E9> wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled [[octopus]] and small [[fish]], [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and [[cheese]]. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish. Sweet desserts such as [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of [[wine]]s including [[retsina]]. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island also uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines do: [[oregano]], [[mint]], [[garlic]], [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use "sweet" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[cloves]] in stews.

===Music===
{{main|Greek music}}

Greek music extends far back into Ancient times were mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons, instruments during that time period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times were boys taught music from the age of six. Later it was influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Eastern Europe and the [[Byzantine Empire]] that changed Greek music. While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, Byzantine music was deprived of polyphony and instrumental accompaniment, elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, the isolation of [[Byzantium]], which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented with a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]. 

[[Image:Bouzouki tetrachordo.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Bouzouki]], a stringed instrument and the mainstay of modern Greek music.]]

Along with the Byzantine chant, a form of artistic musical creation, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries A.D. and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]] struggle in 1821. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, paraloghes (narrative song or ballad), love songs, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.

The Second World War, German occupation of Greece and the Greek Civil War decisively influenced the Greek folk song. After the first World War and the 1922 debacle, the trend towards urban living focused on Athens where popular musicians congregated and, in 1928, founded their own professional society: the Athens and Piraeus Musicians Society. Until the early years of this century, musical tradition was preserved in the villages where there was little contact with the outside world.
The events and social changes of the 20th century changed the fate of the folk song in Greece. Once the seat of folk song was the village, now the reverse applies. The commercialized folk song spreads in all directions to the remotest villages. The authentic songs and dances have been replaced by the stylized modern "folk songs" written by contemporary musicians which they write new lyrics to authentic folk tunes, changing them enough to ensure copyright protection.

The Hellenic Armed Forces are overseen by the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] (<U+0393><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC> <U+0395><U+03C0><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03BF> <U+0395><U+03B8><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE><U+03C2> <U+0386><U+03BC><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C2> - <U+0393><U+0395><U+0395><U+0398><U+0391>) and consists of three branches:
*[[Hellenic Army]]
*[[Hellenic Navy]]
*[[Hellenic Air Force]]

The civilian authority for the Greek military is the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]]. Furthermore, Greece maintains the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] for law enforcement in the sea and search and rescue.

Greece currently has universal compulsory military service for males while females (who may serve in the military) are exempted from conscription. As of 2006, Greece has mandatory military service of 12 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a complete professional army system, the government had promised that the mandatory military service would be cut or even abolished completely. Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard, service in the Guard is paid. As a member of [[NATO]], the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance.
