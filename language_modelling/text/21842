'''''Mother's Milk''''' is the fourth studio album by [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. It was released on [[August 16]], [[1989]]. It has sold 2 million copies and achieved double-platinum certification.

''Mother's Milk'' peaked at #52 on ''[[Billboard Top 200]]'' album chart and it was certified gold by mid-1990 and platinum in 2005.

==Background==
Before the album was recorded, [[guitarist]] [[Hillel Slovak]] died on [[June 25]], [[1988]]  which caused [[drummer]] [[Jack Irons]] to leave the band. After temporarily employing former [[P-Funk]] guitarist [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]] and [[Dead Kennedys]] drummer [[D. H. Peligro]], guitarist [[John Frusciante]] and drummer [[Chad Smith]] were chosen to replace them. Originally the album was planned as ''The Rockin' Freakapotamus'', but after Slovak's death the recordings were stopped. Now "The Rockin' Freakapotamus" is the name of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' [[fan club]].

==Recording and production==
Not everything was smooth sailing during the recording sessions in ''Mother's Milk''. Frontman [[Anthony Kiedis]] noted in his autobiography that Frusciante and producer Michael Beinhorn often fought over the former's guitar work. As such the overall guitar sound on the album is almost overpowering, often drowning out the sound of the other instruments and in particular Kiedis' vocals (This is clearly evident at the end of "Nobody Weird Like Me".)
