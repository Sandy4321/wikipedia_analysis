In the context of [[spaceflight]], a '''satellite''' is an [[Physical body|object]] which has been placed into [[orbit]] by [[human]] endeavor. Such objects are sometimes called '''artificial satellites''' to distinguish them from [[natural satellite]]s such as the [[Moon]].

The first artificial satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. By 2009 thousands of satellites have been launched into orbit around the Earth. These originate from more than 50 countries and have used the satellite launching capabilities of ten nations. A few hundred satellites are currently operational, whereas thousands of unused satellites and satellite fragments orbit the Earth as [[space debris]]. A few [[space probe]]s have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. 
 
Satellites are used for a large number of purposes. Common types include military (spy) and civilian Earth observation satellites, communication satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and research satellites. [[Space station]]s and human[[spacecraft]] in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include [[low Earth orbit]], [[polar orbit]], and [[geostationary orbit]]. 

Satellites are usually semi-independent computer controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude control and orbit control. 


== History ==
=== Early conceptions ===
The first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit is a [[short story]] by [[Edward Everett Hale]], ''[[The Brick Moon]]''. The story is serialized in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', starting in 1869.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Rockets in Science Fiction (Late 19th Century)|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/rocketry/tl4.html|publisher=''[[Marshall Space Flight Center]]''|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>
{{citebook|title= Science-fiction, the Early Years |author=Everett Franklin Bleiler|coauthors=Richard Bleiler|pages=325|isbn=978-0873384162 |publisher=[[Kent State University Press]]|year=1991}}</ref> The idea surfaces again in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[The Begum's Fortune]]'' (1879).

In 1903 [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] (1857<U+2013>1935) published ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]: ''<U+0418><U+0441><U+0441><U+043B><U+0435><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043C><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+044B><U+0445> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+043D><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432> <U+0440><U+0435><U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+044B><U+043C><U+0438> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0438><U+0431><U+043E><U+0440><U+0430><U+043C><U+0438>''), which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch [[spacecraft]]. He calculated the [[orbital speed]] required for a minimal [[orbit]] around the Earth at 8&nbsp;km/s, and that a [[multi-stage rocket]] fueled by liquid [[propellant]]s could be used to achieve this. He proposed the use of [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]], though other combinations can be used. 

In 1928 Slovenian [[Herman_Poto%C4%8Dnik|Herman Poto<U+010D>nik]] (1892<U+2013>1929) published his sole book, ''The Problem of Space Travel <U+2014> The Rocket Motor'' ([[German language|German]]: ''Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums <U+2014> der Raketen-Motor''), a plan for a breakthrough into space and a permanent human presence there. He conceived of a space station in detail and calculated its [[geostationary orbit]]. He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space couldn't be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Tsiolkovsky) and discussed communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short of the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.

In a 1945 ''[[Wireless World]]'' article the English science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] (1917-2008) described in detail the possible use of [[communications satellite]]s for mass communications.<ref>{{citebook|title= Visions of Technology |author= Richard Rhodes|pages=160|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=2000|isbn=978-0684863115 }}</ref> Clarke examined the logistics of satellite launch, possible [[orbits]] and other aspects of the creation of a network of world-circling satellites, pointing to the benefits of high-speed global communications. He also suggested that three [[geostationary]] satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.

=== History of artificial satellites ===
{{see|Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes}}
{{see also|Space Race}}

The first artificial satellite was [[Sputnik 1]], launched by the [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957, and initiating the [[Soviet]] [[Sputnik program]], with [[Sergei Korolev]] as chief designer and [[Kerim Kerimov]] as his assistant.<ref>{{citation|contribution=Kerim Kerimov|title=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/914879/Kerim-Kerimov|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> This in turn triggered the [[Space Race]] between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]]. 

Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high [[Earth's atmosphere#Temperature and layers|atmospheric layers]] through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on [[radio]]-signal distribution in the [[ionosphere]]. Because the satellite's body was filled with pressurized [[nitrogen]], ''Sputnik 1'' also provided the first opportunity for [[meteoroid]] detection, as a loss of internal pressure due to meteoroid penetration of the outer surface would have been evident in the temperature data sent back to Earth. The unanticipated announcement of ''Sputnik 1'''s success precipitated the [[Sputnik crisis]] in the [[United States]] and ignited the so-called [[Space Race]] within the [[Cold War]].

''[[Sputnik 2]]'' was launched on November 3, 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a [[dog]] named [[Laika]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Animals in Space |publisher=''[[NASA]]'' |url=http://history.nasa.gov/animals.html|accessdate=2007-08-08}}</ref>

In May, 1946, [[Project RAND]] had released the [[Preliminary Design of a Experimental World-Circling Spaceship]], which stated, "A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century.<ref>
{{citeweb|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/special_memoranda/SM11827/index.html|title=Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship|publisher=''[[RAND]]''|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>
The [[United States]] had been considering launching [[orbit]]al satellites since 1945 under the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] of the [[United States Navy]]. The [[United States Air Force]]'s Project RAND eventually released the above report, but did not believe that the satellite was a potential military weapon; rather, they considered it to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda. In 1954, the Secretary of Defense stated, "I know of no American satellite program."<ref>{{citebook|title=Venture Into Space: Early Years of Goddard Space Flight Center|author=Alfred Rosenthal|publisher=''[[NASA]]''|year=1968|pages=15}}</ref>

On July 29, 1955, the [[White House]] announced that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as [[Project Vanguard]]. On July 31, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.

Following pressure by the [[American Rocket Society]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[International Geophysical Year]], military interest picked up and in early 1955 the Air Force and Navy were working on [[Project Orbiter]], which involved using a [[Jupiter-C IRBM|Jupiter C rocket]] to launch a satellite.  The project succeeded, and [[Explorer 1]] became the United States' first satellite on January 31, 1958.<ref>{{citeweb|title=50th anniversary of first U.S. satellite launch celebrated
|url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/01/30/state/n151715S68.DTL|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''|author=Alicia Chang|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

In June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the Air Force used resources of the [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] to catalog 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.<ref>{{cite web|author=David S. F. Portree|coauthors=Joseph P. Loftus, Jr |url=http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/TP-1999-208856.pdf |title=Orbital Debris: A Chronology |pages=18 |date=1999 |publisher=''[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]]''|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

The largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the Earth is the [[International Space Station]].

== Space Surveillance Network ==
The [[United States Space Surveillance Network]] (SSN) has been tracking space objects since 1957 when the Soviets opened the space age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 space objects orbiting Earth. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's turbulent atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The space objects now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent of the space objects are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are [[space debris]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Orbital Debris Education Package|url=http://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/EducationPackage.pdf|publisher=''[[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]]''|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> [[USSTRATCOM]] is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles. The SSN tracks space objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter (baseball size) or larger.

== Non-Military Satellite Services ==
There are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:<ref name=Grant&Meadows>{{citebook|author=Grant, A.|coauthors=Meadows, J.|year=2004|title=Communication Technology Update|edition=ninth edition|pages=284|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|isbn=0240806409}}</ref>

=== Fixed Satellite Service ===
[[Fixed Service Satellite|Fixed satellite services]] handle hundreds of billions of voice, data, and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earth<U+2019>s surface.

=== Mobile Satellite Systems ===
Mobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.

=== Scientific Research Satellite (commercial and noncommercial) ===
Scientific research satellites provide us with meteorological information, land survey data (e.g., remote sensing), Amateur (HAM) Radio, and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.

==Types==
[[Image:Milstar.jpg|thumb|[[MILSTAR]]: A communication satellite]]
*'''[[Anti-satellite weapon|Anti-Satellite weapons/"Killer Satellites"]]''' are satellites that are armed, designed to take out enemy warheads, satellites, other space assets. They may have particle weapons, energy weapons, kinetic weapons, nuclear and/or conventional missiles and/or a combination of these weapons. 
*'''[[Astronomical satellite]]s''' are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.
*'''[[Biosatellite]]s''' are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation.
*'''[[Communications satellite]]s''' are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of [[telecommunications]]. Modern communications satellites typically use [[geosynchronous orbit]]s, [[Molniya orbit]]s or [[Low Earth orbit]]s.
*'''[[Miniaturized satellites]]''' are satellites of unusually low weights and small sizes.<ref>{{citeweb|date=2008|pages=6|title=Workshop on the Use of Microsatellite Technologies|url=http://www.unoosa.org/pdf/reports/ac105/AC105_903E.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> New classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500<U+2013>100&nbsp;kg), microsatellite (below 100&nbsp;kg), nanosatellite (below 10&nbsp;kg).
*'''[[Global Navigation Satellite System|Navigational satellites]]''' are satellites which use [[radio]] time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.
*'''[[Reconnaissance satellite]]s''' are [[Earth observation satellite]] or [[communications satellite]] deployed for [[military]] or [[espionage|intelligence]] applications.Very little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified.
*'''[[Earth observation satellite]]s''' are satellites intended for non-military uses such as [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]al monitoring, [[meteorology]], [[map making]] etc. (See especially [[Earth Observing System]].)
*'''[[Space station]]s''' are man-made structures that are designed for [[human|human beings]] to live on in [[outer space]]. A space station is distinguished from other manned [[spacecraft]] by its lack of major [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] or [[landing]] facilities <U+2014> instead, other vehicles are used as transport to and from the station. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in [[orbit]], for periods of [[week]]s, [[month]]s, or even [[year]]s.
*'''[[Tether satellite]]s''' are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a [[tether]].
*'''[[Weather satellite]]s''' are primarily used to monitor [[Earth]]'s [[weather]] and [[climate]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Earth Observations from Space|url=http://dels.nas.edu/dels/rpt_briefs/earth_observations_final.pdf|year=2007|publisher=''[[National Academy of Science]]''|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

==Orbit types==
<!-- {{Mergeto|List of orbits|date=November 2008}} NO, this is a summary OLD: seems essentially an exact duplication -->
{{main|List of orbits}}

[[Image:Orbits around earth scale diagram.svg|thumb|Various earth orbits to scale; cyan represents low earth orbit, yellow represents medium earth orbit, the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit, the green dash-dot line the orbit of [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites, and the red dotted line the orbit of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).]]

The first satellite, [[Sputnik 1]], was put into orbit around [[Earth]] and was therefore in [[geocentric orbit]]. By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 2456 artificial satellites orbiting the [[Earth]]. Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their [[altitude]], [[inclination]] and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]].

The commonly used altitude classifications are [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO), [[Medium Earth Orbit]] (MEO) and [[High Earth Orbit]] (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2000&nbsp;km, and Medium Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than that but still below the altitude for [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 35786&nbsp;km. High Earth Orbit is any orbit higher than the altitude for geosynchronous orbit.

===Centric classifications===
* '''[[galactic center|Galactocentric orbit]]''': An orbit about the center of a [[galaxy]]. [[Earth]]'s [[sun]] follows this type of orbit about the [[galactic center]] of the [[Milky Way]]. 
* '''[[Heliocentric orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. In our [[Solar System]], all [[planets]], [[comets]], and [[asteroids]] are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of [[space debris]]. [[Moons#Moons of the Solar system|Moon]]s by contrast are not in a [[heliocentric orbit]] but rather orbit their parent planet.
* '''[[Geocentric orbit]]''': An orbit around the planet [[Earth]], such as the [[Moon]] or [[artificial satellite]]s. Currently there are approximately 2465 artificial satellites orbiting the [[Earth]].
* '''[[Areocentric orbit]]''': An orbit around the planet [[Mars]], such as [[Mars moons|moon]]s or [[artificial satellite]]s.

===Altitude classifications===
* '''[[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO)''': [[Geocentric orbit]]s ranging in altitude from 0<U+2013>2000 [[km]] (0<U+2013>1240 [[mile]]s)
* '''[[Medium Earth Orbit]] (MEO)''': [[Geocentric orbit]]s ranging in altitude from 2000 [[km]] (1240 [[mile]]s) to just below [[geosynchronous orbit]] at 35786 [[km]] (22240 [[mile]]s). Also known as an [[intermediate circular orbit]].
* '''[[High Earth Orbit]] (HEO)''': [[Geocentric orbit]]s above the altitude of [[geosynchronous orbit]] 35786 [[km]] (22240 [[mile]]s).
[[Image:Orbitalaltitudes.jpg|thumb|Orbital Altitudes of several significant satellites of earth.]]

===Inclination classifications===
* '''[[Inclined orbit]]''': An orbit whose [[inclination]] in reference to the [[equatorial plane]] is not zero degrees. 
** '''[[Polar orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore it has an [[inclination]] of (or very close to) 90 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s.
** '''Polar [[sun synchronous orbit]]''': A nearly [[polar orbit]] that passes the [[equator]] at the same local time on every pass. Useful for [[image]] taking satellites because [[shadow]]s will be nearly the same on every pass.

===Eccentricity classifications===
* '''[[Circular orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] that has an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0 and whose path traces a [[circle]].
** '''[[Hohmann transfer orbit]]''': An orbital maneuver that moves a [[spacecraft]] from one [[circular orbit]] to another using two engine [[impulse]]s. This maneuver was named after [[Walter Hohmann]].
* '''[[Elliptic orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an [[ellipse]].
** '''[[Geosynchronous transfer orbit]]''': An [[elliptic orbit]] where the [[perigee]] is at the [[altitude]] of a [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO) and the [[apogee]] at the [[altitude]] of a [[geosynchronous orbit]].
** '''[[Geostationary transfer orbit]]''': An [[elliptic orbit]] where the [[perigee]] is at the [[altitude]] of a [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO) and the [[apogee]] at the [[altitude]] of a [[geostationary orbit]].
** '''[[Molniya orbit]]''': A highly [[elliptic orbit]] with [[inclination]] of 63.4<U+00B0> and [[orbital period]] of half of a [[sidereal day]] (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the [[planet]].
** '''[[Tundra orbit]]''': A highly [[elliptic orbit]] with [[inclination]] of 63.4<U+00B0> and [[orbital period]] of one [[sidereal day]] (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the [[planet]].
* '''[[Hyperbolic orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] with the eccentricity greater than 1. Such an orbit also has a [[velocity]] in excess of the [[escape velocity]] and as such, will escape the gravitational pull of the [[planet]] and continue to travel [[infinitely]]. 
* '''[[Parabolic orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] with the eccentricity equal to 1. Such an orbit also has a [[velocity]] equal to the [[escape velocity]] and therefore will escape the gravitational pull of the [[planet]] and travel until its [[velocity]] [[Relative motion#Relative motion|relative]] to the [[planet]] is 0. If the speed of such an orbit is increased it will become a [[hyperbolic orbit]].
** '''[[Escape orbit]] (EO)''': A high-speed [[parabolic orbit]] where the object has [[escape velocity]] and is moving away from the [[planet]].
** '''[[Capture orbit]]''': A high-speed [[parabolic orbit]] where the object has [[escape velocity]] and is moving toward the [[planet]].

===Synchronous classifications===
* '''[[Synchronous orbit]]''': An orbit where the satellite has an [[orbital period]] equal to the average [[rotational period]] (earth's is: 23 [[hour]]s, 56 [[minute]]s, 4.091 [[second]]s) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body.   To a ground observer such a satellite would trace an [[analemma]] (figure 8) in the sky. 
* '''[[Semi-synchronous orbit]] (SSO)''': An [[orbit]] with an [[altitude]] of approximately 20200 km (12544.2 miles) and an [[orbital period]] equal to one-half of the average [[rotational period]] (earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited 
* '''[[Geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO)''': Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35786 km (22240 miles). Such a satellite would trace an [[analemma]] (figure 8) in the sky.
** '''[[Geostationary orbit]] (GSO)''': A [[geosynchronous orbit]] with an [[inclination]] of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Pearl Harbor In Space|author=[[James Oberg]]|url=http://www.jamesoberg.com/pearl.html|publisher=''[[Omni Magazine]]''|accessdate=2008-03-06|year=1984|month=July|pages=42-44}}</ref>
*** '''[[Clarke orbit]]''': Another name for a [[geostationary orbit]]. Named after scientist and writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. 
** '''[[Supersynchronous orbit]]''': A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west.  Also a [[synonym]] for Disposal orbit.
** '''[[Subsynchronous orbit]]''': A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.
** '''[[Graveyard orbit]]''': An orbit a few hundred kilometers above [[geosynchronous]] that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.
*** '''[[Disposal orbit]]''': A [[synonym]] for [[graveyard orbit]].
*** '''[[Junk orbit]]''': A [[synonym]] for [[graveyard orbit]].
* '''[[Areosynchronous orbit]]''': A [[synchronous orbit]] around the planet [[Mars]] with an [[orbital period]] equal in length to Mars' [[sidereal day]], 24.6229 [[hours]]. 
* '''[[Areostationary orbit]] (ASO)''': A [[circular]] [[areosynchronous orbit]] on the [[equatorial plane]] and about 17000 [[km]](10557 [[mile]]s)  above the surface. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.
* '''[[Heliosynchronous orbit]]''': An [[heliocentric orbit]] about the [[Sun]] where the satellite's [[orbital period]] matches the [[Sun]]'s period of [[rotation]]. These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 [[gigametre|Gm]] (0,1628 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]) around the [[Sun]], a little less than half of the [[orbital radius]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

===Special classifications===
* '''[[Sun-synchronous orbit]]''': An orbit which combines [[altitude]] and [[inclination]] in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the [[planets]]'s surface at the same local [[solar time]]. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for [[imaging]], [[spy satellite|spy]], and [[weather satellite]]s.
* '''[[Moon orbit]]''': The [[Orbital parameters|orbital characteristics]] of [[earth]]'s [[moon]]. Average [[altitude]] of 384403 kilometres (238857 mi), [[elliptical orbit|elliptical]]-[[inclined orbit]].

=== Pseudo-orbit classifications ===
* '''[[Horseshoe orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain  [[planet]] but is actually in [[Co-orbital satellite|co-orbit]] with the [[planet]]. See asteroids [[3753 Cruithne|3753]] (Cruithne) and [[2002 AA29|2002 AA<small><sub>29</sub></small>]].
* '''[[Exo-orbit]]''': A maneuver where a [[spacecraft]] approaches the height of [[orbit]] but lacks the [[velocity]] to sustain it.  
** '''[[Suborbital spaceflight]]''': A [[synonym]] for [[exo-orbit]].
* '''[[Lunar transfer orbit]] (LTO)'''
* '''[[Prograde orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] with an inclination of less than 90<U+00B0>. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.
* '''[[Retrograde orbit]]''': An [[orbit]] with an [[inclination]] of more than 90<U+00B0>. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet.  Apart from those in [[sun-synchronous orbit]], few satellites are launched into [[retrograde orbit]] because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a [[prograde orbit]]. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of [[velocity]] equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch [[latitude]].
*'''[[Halo orbit]]''' and '''[[Lissajous orbit]]''': Orbits "around" [[Lagrangian point]]s.

== Satellite Modules ==
The satellite<U+2019>s functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the <U+201C>anatomy<U+201D> of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules.<ref name=Grant&Meadows/> Note that some novel architectural concepts such as [[Fractionated Spacecraft]] somewhat upset this taxonomy.

=== Spacecraft bus or service module === 
This [[Spacecraft bus|bus module]] consist of the following subsystems:
* '''The Structural Subsystems'''
The structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure, shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage, and controls the satellite<U+2019>s spin functions.
* '''The Telemetry Subsystems''' (aka Command and Data Handling, C&DH)
The telemetry subsystem  monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control station<U+2019>s commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.
* '''The Power Subsystems'''
The power subsystem consists of solar panels and backup batteries that generate power when the satellite passes into the earth<U+2019>s shadow. Nuclear power sources ([[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s) have been used in several successful satellite programs including the [[Nimbus program]] (1964-1978).<ref>{{citeweb|title=Radioisotope-based Nuclear Power Strategy for Exploration Systems Development|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/schmidtstaif06.pdf|author=George Schmidt|coauthors=Mike Houts|publisher=''[[Marshall Space Flight Center]]''|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref>
* '''The Thermal Control Subsystems
The thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite<U+2019>s body (e.g. [[Optical Solar Reflector]])
* '''The Attitude and Orbit Controlled Control Subsystems
{{main|Attitude control}}
The attitude and orbit controlled subsystem consists of small rocket thrusters that keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas positioning in the right directions.

=== Communication Payload ===
The second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponders is capable of :
* Receiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).
* Amplifying received radio signals
* Sorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).

== End of Life ==
When satellites reach the end of their mission, satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in it's current orbit or moving the satellite to a [[graveyard orbit]].  Historically, due to budgetary contraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites are rarely de-orbited.  One example of this practice is the satellite [[Vanguard 1]].  Launched in 1958, [[Vanguard 1]], the 4th manmade satallite put in [[Geocentric orbit]], was still in orbit as of June 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://169.253.2.103/oes/search/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.display | title=U.S. Space Objects Registry}}</ref>

Instead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.<ref>

==Launch-capable countries ==
{{main|Timeline of first orbital launches by nationality}}
[[Image:Delta-M with Skynet-1A.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of the first [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Skynet (satellites)|Skynet]] military satellite.]]
This list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites <U+2014> which relatively speaking, does not require much economic, scientific and industrial capacity <U+2014> but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services.  This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated.

<!-- Please do not add Italy, Kazakhstan and do not delete France, UK, Ukraine. Also, do not make changes to the orders OR do not add numbers under "Order" for Ukrane or Russia - see below, and on talk page, and article Timeline of first orbital launches by country for details -->

===Notes===
# [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] inherited launch capability from the Soviet Union rather than developing it indigenously.
# [[France]], [[United Kingdom]] launched their first satellites by own launchers from foreign [[spaceport]]s.<!--do not add Ukrane here without discussion!-->
# [[North Korea]] (1998) and [[Iraq]] (1989) have claimed orbital launches (satellite and warhead accordingly), but these claims are unconfirmed.  
# In addition to the above, countries such as [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Argentina]], [[Egypt]] and private companies such as [[OTRAG]], have developed their own launchers, but have not had a successful launch. 
# As of 2009, only eight countries from the list above ( [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] instead of [[USSR]], also [[USA]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Israel]], and [[Iran]]) and one regional organization (the [[European Space Agency]], ESA) have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles. (The launch capabilities of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] now fall under the [[ESA]].)
# Several other countries, including [[South Korea]], [[Brazil]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], [[Taiwan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]]{{Fact|date=February 2009}} and [[Turkey]], are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities.
# It is scheduled that in summer or autumn of 2009 [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute|South Korea]] will launch a [[Korea Space Launch Vehicle|KSLV]] rocket (created with assistance of Russia).
# [[North Korea]] claimed a launch in April 2009, but [[U.S.]] and [[South Korean]] defense officials and weapons experts later reported that the rocket failed to send a satellite into orbit, if that was the goal. <ref>{{citeweb|title=North Korean Missile Launch Was a Failure, Experts Say|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/world/asia/06korea.html?hp |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=NORAD and USNORTHCOM monitor North Korean launch |url=http://www.northcom.mil/News/2009/040509.html|publisher=''[[United States Northern Command]]''|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> It is believed that what has been done was an attempt to test a [[ballistic missile]] rocket rather than launch a satellite into orbit and even the [[ballistic missile]] test was a failure.

== Launch capable private entities ==
On September 28, 2008, the private aerospace firm SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon 1 rocket in to orbit. This marked the first time that a privately built liquid-fueled booster was able to reach orbit.<ref name="malik">{{citeweb|title=SpaceX Successfully Launches Falcon 1 Rocket Into Orbit |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/080928-spacex-falcon1-fourthtest.html|publisher=''[[Space.com]]''|author=Tariq Malik|accessdate=2008-10-02}}</ref> The rocket carried a prism shaped 1.5 m (5 ft) long payload mass simulator that was set into orbit. The dummy satellite, known as Ratsat, will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.<ref name="malik"/>

While [[Canada]] was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space,<ref>{{citebook|title=Space Programs Outside the United States|author=Daphne Burleson|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|pages=43|year=2005|isbn=978-0786418527}}</ref> it was launched aboard a U.S. rocket from a U.S. spaceport.  The same goes for [[Australia]], who launched on-board a donated [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone]] rocket. The first Italian-launched was [[San Marco 1]], launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. [[Scout rocket]] from Wallops Island (VA,USA) with an Italian Launch Team trained by NASA.<ref>{{citebook|title=Europe's Space Programme|pages=114|author=Brian Harvey|year=2003|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-1852337223}}</ref> Australia's launch project ([[WRESAT]]) involved a donated U.S. missile and U.

==Attacks on satellites==
{{ Details|Anti-satellite weapon}}

In recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Hack a Satellite while it is in orbit|url=http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/security/dmorrill/archives/hack-a-satellite-while-it-is-in-orbit-15690|author=Dan Morrill|publisher=''[[ITtoolbox]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=AsiaSat accuses Falungong of hacking satellite signals|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5205866_ITM|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>

Satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth. [[Russia]], the [[United States]] and [[PRC|China]] have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites.<ref name="asat">{{citeweb|author=William J. Broad|coauthors=David E. Sanger|title=China Tests Anti-Satellite Weapon, Unnerving U.S.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/world/asia/18cnd-china.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|year=2007|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> In 2007 the [[China|Chinese]] military shot down an aging weather satellite,<ref name="asat"/> followed by the [[US Navy]] shooting down a [[NRO L-21|defunct spy satellite]] in February 2008.<ref>{{citeweb|year=2008|title=Navy Missile Successful as Spy Satellite Is Shot Down |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/science_news/4251430.html|publisher=''[[Popular Mechanics]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>

===Jamming===
Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to [[Radio jamming|jamming]] by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming,<ref>{{citeweb|author=Jeremy Singer|year=2003|title=U.S.-Led Forces Destroy GPS Jamming Systems in Iraq |url=http://www.space.com/news/gps_iraq_030325.html|publisher=''[[Space.com]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|author=Bob Brewin|year=2003|title=Homemade GPS jammers raise concerns|url=http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,77702,00.html|publisher=''[[Computerworld]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.<ref>{{citeweb|year=2008|title=Iran government jamming exile satellite TV|url=http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2852|publisher=''[[Iran Focus]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|title=Libya Pinpointed as Source of Months-Long Satellite Jamming in 2006|url=http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_070409.html|author=Peter de Selding|year=2007|publisher=''[[Space.com]]''|accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref>
It is trivial to transmit a carrier to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with any other users of the transponder. It is common on commercial satellite space for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency and dual illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pin point the source of any carrier and manage the xponder space effectively.
