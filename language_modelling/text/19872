'''Gabriel Jones''' (May 17, 1724 <U+2013> October 1806) was an 18th-century [[Welsh American]] lawyer, legislator, court clerk and civil servant in the [[Colony of Virginia|colony]] (and later U.S. state) of [[Virginia]].

Jones attended [[Christ's Hospital]] (also known as "The Bluecoat School"), after which he served as an [[indenture]]d apprentice studying [[jurisprudence]] under a [[solicitor]] in the [[Court of Chancery]] and of [[Lyon's Inn]] in [[Middlesex]]. At the age of 21, Jones was admitted to practice law following the completion of his apprenticeship. Jones was persuaded by either [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], the [[Land tenure|landowner]] of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], or his relative [[Hugh Mercer]] to return to Virginia, where he engaged in the practice of law.

Jones served as the Clerk of Court for [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]) for a tenure lasting 25 years (1757<U+2013>1782) and represented [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]], Hampshire, and [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta]] counties as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]]. In addition, Jones also served as the [[County attorney|King's Attorney]] for Augusta County and as the [[coroner]] for Frederick County. He was elected to represent Virginia at the [[Continental Congress]], but did not attend, and was elected to represent [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] in the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]]. Jones was an uncle of American pioneer [[John Gabriel Jones]] (1752<U+2013>1776) and he was a friend of both [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]].

== Early life and education ==
Gabriel Jones was born on May 17, 1724<ref name = "Munske1">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=39.}}</ref><ref name = "WVHS1">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=195.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell1">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=392.}}</ref> approximately {{convert|3|mi}} from [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]],<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Loth2">{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=11.}}</ref> in [[York County, Virginia|York County]], [[Colony of Virginia]].<ref name = "WVHS1"/> He was a son of John and Elizabeth Jones,<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> who had arrived in Virginia several years earlier from [[Montgomeryshire]] in northern [[Wales]], [[Great Britain]],<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> where Jones's family was of [[gentry|noble]] descent.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones's father was a [[Weaving|weaver]].<ref name = "Brown1">{{Harvnb|Brown|1965|p=116.}}</ref> Jones's elder sister Elizabeth was born on August 13, 1721 at the [[College of William & Mary]] in Williamsburg<ref name = "Waddell1"/> and his younger brother John was born on June 12, 1725 at the same location as Jones.<ref name = "Waddell1"/>

According to Jones family tradition, Jones's father lost a significant amount of his wealth while in Virginia, which brought about his family's return to England in 1727.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Jones's father's death prior to 1727 also precipitated the family's move and following their relocation to England, Elizabeth raised Jones and his siblings in London where she had Jones's sister [[baptism|baptized]] at [[St Giles in the Fields]] on February 20, 1727.<ref name = "Waddell1"/>

In April 1732, Jones was granted admission to [[Christ's Hospital]] (also known as "The Bluecoat School") in London following his presentation by Thomas Sandford.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green1">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=86.}}</ref> Jones attended Christ's Hospital for seven years.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> On April 12, 1739, he was discharged from the institution by his mother and John Houghton, a [[Solicitor]] in the [[Court of Chancery]] and of Lyon's Inn in Middlesex.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green1"/> Despite its noble origins, Jones's family was of limited means,<ref name = "Waddell1"/>{{efn|name=coin}} and he served as an indentured apprentice studying jurisprudence under Houghton's charge for a term of six years until 1745.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> At the age of 21, Jones was admitted to practice law following the completion of his apprenticeship.<ref name = "Waddell1"/>

== Political career ==

===Return to Virginia===
Following his admission to the bar and the death of his mother in 1745,<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones was persuaded by either [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]],<ref name = "Munske1"/> the [[Land tenure|landowner]] of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]], or his relative [[Hugh Mercer]] to return to Virginia.<ref name = "Green1"/> Once he was "free of his indentures" and had "attained his majority,"<ref name = "Waddell1"/> Jones secured his return to Virginia.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> He settled first in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]<ref name = "Loth2"/> and later relocated to Frederick County,<ref name = "WVHS1"/> after which on March 1, 1747,<ref name = "Waddell1"/> he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> Upon settling in Frederick County, Jones became the private secretary to Lord Fairfax.<ref name = "WVHS1"/>

===House of Burgesses tenures===
Jones was appointed to serve as the first [[county attorney|King's Attorney]] for [[Augusta County, Virginia|Augusta County]] around April 1746, at the age of 22.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green2">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=87.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell2">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=23.}}</ref><ref name = "Waddell6">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=31.}}</ref> The county's court recommended Jones to the position, citing him "as a fit person to transact His Majesty's affairs in this county."<ref name = "Waddell6"/> Jones continued to reside in Frederick County while performing the duties of King's Attorney in Augusta County.<ref name = "Waddell4">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=393.}}</ref> When the first appointed justices of Augusta County assembled on December 9, 1745, the body qualified Jones to practice as an "attorney-at-law" in the county.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell3">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=27.}}</ref> He was the first lawyer to reside within the then-boundaries of Augusta County.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones served in that position for two years until his election to represent [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick County]] as a member of the [[House of Burgesses of Virginia]] in 1748<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/> and he was subsequently re-elected to his seat for the 1749 [[legislative session]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/>

Jones was again elected to represent Frederick County in the House of Burgesses in 1752, but resigned in 1753 to serve as the county's [[coroner]].<ref name = "Munske1"/> In 1753, Jones relocated from Kernstown in Frederick County, to his estate "[[Bogota (Port Republic, Virginia)|Bogota]]" in Augusta County (present-day [[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] near the modern [[unincorporated community]] of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]]).<ref name = "Waddell10">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=481.}}</ref><ref name = "Loth1">{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=9.}}</ref> From 1754 to 1755, Jones served alongside a Mr. Parker representing [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] in the House of Burgesses.<ref name = "Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=45.}}</ref><ref name = "Munske3">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=47.}}</ref> Jones and Parker were Hampshire County's first representatives in the House of Burgesses following the county's creation on May 1, 1754.<ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> Jones, along with Lord Fairfax, was appointed as a [[trustee]] for the towns of [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] and [[Stephens City, Virginia|Stephensburg]] (present-day Stephens City) charged with laying out the towns and establishing regulations for the construction of residences in each town.<ref name = "WVHS1"/>

===Hampshire County Clerk of Court tenure===
[[File:Letter from Gabriel Jones to George Washington, June 6, 1777.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Jones maintained correspondences with [[George Washington]], as evidenced in this June 6, 1777 letter written by Jones to Washington.]]
In 1757, Jones was appointed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron to serve as the Clerk of Court for Hampshire County.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=363.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell4">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=278.}}</ref> Jones was on close terms with Lord Fairfax,<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> and [[George Rockingham Gilmer]] described Jones as a "kinsman, friend and executor of Lord Fairfax."<ref name = "Green1"/> Despite the county's establishment in 1754, it was not until 1757 that formal record keeping was actualized in Hampshire County, due in part to the [[French and Indian War]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell5">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=362.}}</ref> While Archibald Wager was likely the first appointed Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones was the first operational appointee to serve in the position.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell5"/>{{efn|name=first}}{{efn|name=maxwell}} According to [[historian]] Wilmer L. Kerns in ''Hampshire County, West Virginia, 1754<U+2013>2004'' (2004), Jones was "well-organized" and had the "best penmanship of any clerk in the history of the county, in spite of being totally blind in his right eye."<ref name = "Munske1"/> Historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and Howard Llewellyn Swisher described Jones's handwriting as "unmistakable" in their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897).<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>

Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of [[Richmond County, Virginia|Richmond County]] to serve as his deputy clerk.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, occasionally performing duties as acting clerk.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, it is likely that Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=364.}}</ref> According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document court proceedings, which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>

While serving as Clerk of Court, Jones was again elected to serve as a member of the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County from 1757 until 1758<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell8">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=35.}}</ref> and Hampshire County from 1758 until 1761.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> It was during this period that Jones formed a close relationship with George Washington, and the two regularly corresponded.<ref name = "Munske1"/> Jones was elected to serve a final term in the House of Burgesses representing Augusta County in 1771.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell9">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=36.}}</ref> In 1774, Jones was elected to represent Virginia in the [[Continental Congress]],<ref name = "WVHS1"/> but did not attend. When Jones's "Bogota" estate became part of the newly minted Rockingham County following its creation from Augusta County in 1778, Jones thus became a citizen of Rockingham and was summarily appointed as its Deputy [[Commonwealth's Attorney]].<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones was also commissioned to ascertain the "pay and subsistence" of the [[Virginia militia]] and damages caused by [[Cherokee]] and [[Catawba people|Catawba]] Native American tribes throughout the Virginia frontier.<ref name = "WVHS1"/> In addition, Jones was appointed, along with [[Samuel Washington]] and [[George Read (U.S. statesman)|George Read]], by the Continental Congress and Virginia to travel to [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], Pennsylvania to inquire about "the condition of affairs there" in 1777.<ref name = "WVHS1"/> Following the death of Lord Fairfax in 1781, Jones was one of the executors of Lord Fairfax's will.<ref name = "WVHS3">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=87.}}</ref>

Jones served as the Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 25 years until his retirement from the position in 1782.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Maxwell5">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=369.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> In their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897), Maxwell and Swisher theorize that Jones retired from his position due in part to Lord Fairfax's death the previous year and waning British influence in Virginia toward the conclusion of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name = "Maxwell2"/>

== Later life and legacy ==
Following his retirement from his position as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Jones continued to remain active in Virginia political affairs. In 1784, George Washington visited and dined with Jones at his home at "Bogota."<ref name = "Loth2"/> In 1788, Jones and his brother-in-law [[Thomas Lewis (Virginia)|Thomas Lewis]] were elected to represent Rockingham County at the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], where both were fervent proponents for the adoption of the United States Constitution.<ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/>{{efn|name=election}} Archibald Stuart of neighboring Augusta County traveled to Rockingham to canvass for Jones prior to the election, and in return, Jones gifted Stuart a [[chaise]] for he and his wife to return home in to Augusta County.<ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones was among the first [[trustee]]s of the Staunton Academy, following its [[Incorporation (association)|incorporation]] by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] on December 4, 1792.<ref name = "Waddell7">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=203.}}</ref>

Jones continued to practice law in Rockingham County until his death. The road he regularly traveled upon between his residence "Bogota" and Rockingham County's [[county seat|seat]] of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] became known as "The Lawyer's Road"<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/> which evolved to its present name of "Lawyer Road."<ref name = "Loth2"/> Because of his prominence throughout the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Valley of Virginia]] region, and partially due to the fact he was possibly the first lawyer in Augusta County, Jones was nicknamed "''The'' Valley Lawyer."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Brown1"/><ref name = "Green1"/> Jones died at his estate "Bogata"<ref name = "Waddell4"/> in October 1806.<ref name = "Waddell5">{{Harvnb|Waddell|1886|p=394.}}</ref>

In the Spring of 1887, a memorial window to Jones and his wife was installed in a new [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church erected near their former "Bogota" residence.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> Jones was further memorialized in historian Joseph Addison Waddell's ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' (1886), in which he remarked of Jones: "He was considered a man of great ability and unbending integrity. His only fault, or the only one which tradition tells of, was an extremely irritable temper, which, when aroused, expressed itself in the strongest terms he could command, mingled with no little profanity. Having a scorn of all dishonesty and meanness, he did not spare a miscreant by tongue or pen."<ref name = "Waddell4"/> In his ''Historic Families of Kentucky'' (1889), historian and [[genealogist]] Thomas Marshall Green said of Jones: "Gabriel Jones rose rapidly in his profession; in attainments he was second to no man at the colonial bar; in native ability he was conspicuous among those who stood in the first rank."<ref name = "Green1"/><ref name = "Green2"/>

== Personal life ==
Jones married on October 16, 1749 to Margaret Strother Morton (1726<U+2013>1822), the widow of George Morton and the daughter of William Strother and his wife Margaret Watts of [[King George County, Virginia|King George County]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "WVHS1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/><ref name = "Green2"/> Jones's wife lived to be 97, and was described by Waddell in his ''Annals of Augusta County, Virginia'' as "a lady of eminent Christian character."<ref name = "Waddell4"/> Jones and his wife Margaret had three daughters, one son, and a child of unknown sex that died in infancy: Margaret Morton Jones Harvie, married to lawyer Colonel [[John Harvie]] of [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]]; Elizabeth Jones Lewis, married to merchant John Lewis of Fredericksburg (son of [[Fielding Lewis]] and his first wife Catharine Washington); Anna Gabriella Jones Hawkins, married to John Hawkins of Kentucky; and William Strother Jones (born March 21, 1756), married to Fanny Thornton of Fredericksburg.<ref name = "Waddell10"/><ref name = "Waddell5"/><ref name = "Green3">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=89.}}</ref><ref name = "WVHS4">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=193.}}</ref><ref name = "Green4">{{Harvnb|Green|1889|p=90.}}</ref>

Jones was an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]].<ref name = "Munske1"/> As early as 1750, Jones used the same family crest and coat of arms as [[Philology|philologist]] [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], indicating a possible familial relationship between the two.<ref name = "Waddell1"/> Physically, Jones was of short stature,<ref name = "Waddell5"/> and according to an extant contemporary portrait of him by artist [[John Drinker]], Jones sported a wig and an eyepatch over his right eye.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> According to Jones's descendants, it was supposed that his right eye was injured in his earlier years, while others attributed the loss of his right eye to an accident during his later years.<ref name = "Waddell5"/> Jones was completely blind in his right eye, and had likely suffered his injury prior to his tenure as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County in 1757.<ref name = "Munske1"/> [[Philip Doddridge (Virginia)|Philip Doddridge]] described Jones as wearing a [[bicorne]] hat, "frilled shirt bosom," and waistbands.<ref name = "WVHS2">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Historical Society|1992|p=27.}}</ref> He further described Jones as sporting "powdered hair," a blue coat, a white vest, a [[cravat]], silk stockings, and silver knee and shoe buckles.<ref name = "WVHS2"/>

In his spare time during and between holding political appointments and serving in elected offices,<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Jones regularly embarked upon "pleasure trips" to various American cities including [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Another known pastime of Jones's was gaming.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> According to Maxwell and Swisher in their ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia'' (1897), Jones had been gambling over the course of several days while in Richmond until a final game left him with only one [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] remaining in his pocketbook.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Jones was wearing a coat fastened with twelve gold buttons each valued at five dollars,<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> and undeterred after losing his last shilling, he began staking one gold button at a time until he was left with one.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Without hesitation, Jones removed his final button and remarked:<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> "Here goes the last button on Gabe's coat."<ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "Maxwell3">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=365.}}</ref> Maxwell and Swisher state that Jones's remark "became a proverb in Hampshire County" and was used when someone had been driven to extremes and utilized what little resources were left at their disposal.<ref name = "Maxwell3"/>

==Landholdings==
Jones settled in Frederick County and on March 1, 1747, he acquired a [[Land lot|tract of land]] along [[Opequon Creek]] near present-day [[Kernstown, Virginia|Kernstown]], where he resided for several years.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell1"/> On August 8, 1751, Jones acquired from Christopher Francisco of Pennsylvania {{convert|244|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} of land along the northern side of the [[Shenandoah River#South Fork Shenandoah River|South Fork Shenandoah River]] in Augusta County (later Rockingham County) near the present-day unincorporated community of [[Port Republic, Virginia|Port Republic]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/>

While still a resident in Frederick County, Jones purchased another {{convert|400|acre|ha sqmi|lk=on}} on the northern side of the [[James River]] in [[Botetourt County, Virginia|Botetourt County]].<ref name = "Waddell4"/> On December 3, 1753, Jones sold his property near Kernstown in Frederick County, and relocated to his tract of land along the Shenandoah River, on which he established his estate later known as "Bogota."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Waddell2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Waddell10"/> Jones was the first to settle and construct a residence on his "Bogota" property upon his arrival in 1753, and the estate received its name under Jones's occupancy. Jones continued to reside at "Bogata" until his death in 1806.<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Waddell4"/><ref name = "Loth1"/>

Following Jones's death in 1806, his widow Margaret Morton Jones continued to reside at "Bogota" until her own death in 1822.<ref name = "Loth3"/> Jaquelin Harvie, the son of Jones's daughter Margaret Jones Harvie and her husband John Harvie, purchased the "Bogota" estate after the death of Jones's wife and Harvie subsequently sold the property in 1830 to Jacob Strayer, who built the current house in 1845<U+2013>1847.<ref name = "Loth3"/> The original house erected and occupied by Jones was demolished shortly after the construction of a new residence at "Bogota."<ref name = "Loth2"/> The site of Jones's house is presently located on property no longer part of the "Bogota" estate, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 25, 2009.<ref name = "Loth2"/> A log tenant house estimated to have been built during the mid-18th-century during the ownership of the Jones family is extant, and remains part of the current "Bogota" estate, as of 2008.<ref name = "Loth2"/><ref name = "Loth3">{{Harvnb|Loth|Wilson|2008|p=12.}}</ref>
