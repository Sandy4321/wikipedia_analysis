He is best known for his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (known as ''Prolegomenon'' in English), the first volume of his book on [[universal history]], ''Kitab al-Ibar''. However, Ibn Khaldun's ideas were not absorbed by his society, nor were they carried forward by its future generations. Muslims had ignored and lost him for centuries until he was rediscovered by the West in the 19th century as one of the greatest philosophers of Islam.<ref>S. M. Deen (2007) "''Science under Islam: rise, decline and revival''". p.157. ISBN 1-84799-942-5</ref> 

Ibn Khaldun's life is relatively well-documented, as he wrote an [[autobiography]] (<U+0627><U+0644><U+062A><U+0639><U+0631><U+064A><U+0641> <U+0628><U+0627><U+0628><U+0646> <U+062E><U+0644><U+062F><U+0648><U+0646> <U+0648><U+0631><U+062D><U+0644><U+062A><U+0647> <U+063A><U+0631><U+0628><U+0627> <U+0648><U+0634><U+0631><U+0642><U+0627>; ''Al-Ta<U+02BB>r<U+012B>f bi Ibn-Khald<U+016B>n wa Ri<U+0127>latuhu Gharb<U+0101>n wa Sharq<U+0101>n''<ref>Published by Mu<U+0127>ammad ibn-T<U+0101>w<U+012B>t at-Tanj<U+012B>, Cairo 1951</ref>) in which numerous documents regarding his life are quoted word-for-word. However, the autobiography has little to say about his private life, so little is known about his family background. Generally known as "Ibn Khald<U+016B>n" after a remote ancestor, he was born in [[Tunis]] in AD 1332 (732 A.H.) into an upper-class [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] family, the ''Ban<U+016B> Khald<U+016B>n''. His family, which held many high offices in Andalusia, had emigrated to [[Tunisia]] after the fall of [[Seville]] to [[Reconquista]] forces around the middle of the 13th century. Under the Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]] some of his family held political office; Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's father and grandfather however withdrew from political life and joined a mystical order. His brother, Yahya Ibn Khaldun, was also a [[historian]] who wrote a book on the [[Abdalwadid]] dynasty, and who was assassinated by a rival for being the official [[historiographer]] of the court.<ref>{{fr}} [http://books.google.ca/books?id=blQpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA484&dq=Zakariya+Yahya+Ibn+Khaldoun&hl=fr#PPA491,M1 <U+00AB> Lettre <U+00E0> Monsieur Garcin de Tassy <U+00BB>, ''Journal asiatique'', troisi<U+00E8>me s<U+00E9>rie, tome XII, <U+00E9>d. Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> asiatique, Paris, 1841, p. 491]</ref>

In his autobiography, Ibn Khaldun traces his descent back to the time of [[Muhammad]] through an [[Arab]] tribe from [[Yemen]], specifically [[Hadhramaut]], which came to [[Spain]] in the eighth century at the beginning of the Islamic conquest. In his own words: "And our ancestry is from [[Hadhramaut]], from the Arabs of Yemen, via Wa'il ibn Hajar, from the best of the Arabs, well-known and respected." (p.&nbsp;2429, [http://www.alwaraq.com/ Al-Waraq]'s edition). However, the biographer Mohammad Enan questions his claim, suggesting that his family may have been [[Muladi]]s who pretended to be of [[Arab]] origin in order to gain social status.<ref>A., Ibn Khaldun: His life and Works for Mohammad Enan</ref> Enan also mentions a well documented past tradition, concerning certain Berber groups, whereby they delusively "aggrandize" themselves with some Arab ancestry. The motive of such an invention was always the desire for political and societal ascendancy. Some speculate this of the Khaldun family; they elaborate that Ibn Khaldun himself was the product of the same Berber ancestry as the native majority of his birthplace. A point congenial to this posits that Ibn Khaldun's unusual written focus on, and admiration for Berbers reveals a difference towards them that is born of a vested interest in preserving them in the realm of conscious history; such is that which the true Arabs of his day would find no enthusiasm for and indeed a vested interest in suppressing. Moreover the special position that he affords Berbers in his work is fully vindicated upon comparing it with his vitriolic attitudes towards the Arab, and his relative disinterest in the state of affairs outside the Maghreb. In contrast, Muhammad Hozien chooses to believe: "The false [Berber] identity would be valid however at the time that Ibn Khaldun<U+2019>s ancestors left Andalusia and moved to Tunisia they did not change their claim to Arab ancestry. Even in the times when Berbers were ruling, the reigns of Al-Marabats and al-Mowahids, et al. the Ibn Khalduns did not reclaim their Berber heritage."<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/knts.htm#n1 IBN KHALDUN: His Life and Work by Muhammad Hozien]</ref>. This point ignores the aforementioned phenomenon of adopting an Arab ancestry to garner prestige.
===Education===
His family's high rank enabled Ibn Khaldun to study with the best teachers in [[Maghreb]]. He received a classical [[Madrasah|Islamic education]], studying the [[Qur'an]] which he [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorized by heart]], [[Arabic language|Arabic linguistics]], the basis for an understanding of the Qur'an, [[hadith]], [[sharia]] (law) and [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence). He received certification ([[ijazah]]) for all these subjects.<ref>{{cite web|author=Muhammad Hozien|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Work|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/klf.htm|publisher=Islamic Philosophy Online|accessdate=2008-09-19}}</ref> The [[Mysticism|mystic]], [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]], [[Al-Abili]], introduced him to [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|logic]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]], where he above all studied the works of [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]], [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] and [[Tusi]]. At the age of 17, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n lost both his parents to the [[Black Death]], an intercontinental [[epidemic]] of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] that hit [[Tunis]] in 1348&ndash;1349.

Following family tradition, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n strove for a political career. In the face of a tumultuous political situation in North Africa, this required a high degree of skill developing and dropping alliances prudently, to avoid falling with the short-lived regimes of the time. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's autobiography is the story of an adventure, in which he spends time in prison, reaches the highest offices and falls again into exile.

===Early years in Tunis and Granada===
At the age of 20, he began his political career at the Chancellery of the Tunisian ruler [[Ibn Tafrakin]] with the position of ''K<U+0101>tib al-'Al<U+0101>mah'', which consisted of writing in fine [[calligraphy]] the typical introductory notes of official documents. In 1352, Ab<U+016B> Ziad, the Sultan of Constantine, marched on Tunis and defeated it. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n, in any case unhappy with his respected but politically meaningless position, followed his teacher Abili to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. Here the [[Marinid]] [[sultan]] Ab<U+016B> Inan Fares I appointed him as a writer of royal proclamations, which didn't prevent Ibn Khald<U+016B>n from scheming against his employer. In 1357 this brought the 25-year-old a 22-month prison sentence. Upon the death of Ab<U+016B> Inan in 1358, the vizier al-Has<U+0101>n ibn-Umar granted him freedom and reinstated him in his rank and offices. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n then schemed against Ab<U+016B> Inan's successor, Ab<U+016B> Salem Ibrahim III, with Ab<U+016B> Salem's exiled uncle, Ab<U+016B> Salem. When Ab<U+016B> Salem came to power, he gave Ibn Khald<U+016B>n a ministerial position, the first position which corresponded with Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's ambitions.

The treatment Ibn Khaldun received after the fall of Ab<U+016B> Salem through Ibn-Amar <U+02BB>Abdullah, a friend of Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's, was not to his liking, he received no significant official position. At the same time, Amar successfully prevented Ibn Khald<U+016B>n &ndash; whose political skills he was well aware of &ndash; from allying with the [[Abd al-Wadid]]s in [[Tlemcen]]. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n therefore decided to move to [[Granada]]. He could be sure of a positive welcome there, since at Fez he had helped the Sultan of Granada, the [[Nasrid]] Muhammad V, regain power from his temporary exile. In 1364 Muhammad entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to the King of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Pedro of Castile|Pedro the Cruel]], to endorse a peace treaty. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n successfully carried out this mission, and politely declined Pedro's offer to remain at his court and have his family's Spanish possessions returned to him.

[[Image:Ibn Khaldoun.jpg|thumb|Statue of Ibn Khaldoun in [[Tunis]].]]

In Granada, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n quickly came into competition with Muhammad's vizier, Ibn al-Khatib, who saw the close relationship between Muhammad and Ibn Khald<U+016B>n with increasing mistrust. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n tried to shape the young Muhammad into his ideal of a wise ruler, an enterprise which Ibn al-Khatib thought foolish and a danger to peace in the country &ndash; and history proved him right. At al-Khatib's instigation, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n was eventually sent back to North Africa. Al-Khatib himself was later accused by Muhammad of having unorthodox philosophical views, and murdered, despite an attempt by Ibn Khald<U+016B>n to intercede on behalf of his old rival.

In his autobiography, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n tells us little about his conflict with Ibn al-Khatib and the reasons for his departure. The orientalist [[Muhsin Mahdi]] interprets this as showing that Ibn Khald<U+016B>n later realised that he had completely misjudged Muhammad&nbsp;V.

Back in Africa, the [[Hafsid]] [[sultan]] of [[Bougie]], Ab<U+016B> <U+02BB>Abdall<U+0101>h, (who had been his companion in prison) received him with great enthusiasm, and made Ibn Khald<U+016B>n his prime minister. During this period, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n carried out a daring mission to collect taxes among the local Berber tribes. After the death of Ab<U+016B> <U+02BB>Abdall<U+0101>h in 1366, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n changed sides once again and allied himself with the ruler of [[Tlemcen]], Ab<U+016B> l-Abbas. A few years later he was taken prisoner by <U+02BB>Abdu l-Az<U+012B>z, who had defeated the sultan of Tlemcen and seized the throne. He then entered a monastic establishment, and occupied himself with scholastic duties, until in 1370 he was sent for to Tlemcen by the new sultan. After the death of <U+02BB>Abdu l-Az<U+012B>z, he resided at Fez, enjoying the patronage and confidence of the regent.

Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's political skills, above all his good relationship with the wild Berber tribes, were in high demand among the North African rulers, whereas he himself began to tire of politics and constant switching of allegiances. In 1375, sent by Ab<U+016B> Hammu, the <U+02BB>Abdu l Wadid Sultan of [[Tlemcen]], on a mission to the Dawadida Arabs tribes of Biskra. Thereafter Ibn Khald<U+016B>n returns to the West sought refuge with one of the Berber tribes, in the west of [[Algeria]], in the town of [[Qalat Ibn Salama]]. He lived there for over three years under their protection, taking advantage of his seclusion to write the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' "Prolegomena", the introduction to his planned history of the world. In Ibn Salama, however, he lacked the necessary texts to complete the work. As a result, in 1378, he returned to his native Tunis, which in the mean time had been conquered by Ab<U+016B> l-Abbas, who took Ibn Khald<U+016B>n back into his service. There he devoted himself almost exclusively to his studies and completed his history of the world. His relationship with Ab<U+016B> l-Abbas remained strained, as the latter questioned his loyalty. This was brought into sharp contrast after Ibn Khald<U+016B>n presented him with a copy of the completed history omitting the usual [[panegyric]] to the ruler. Under pretence of going on the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]] &ndash; something a Muslim ruler could not simply refuse permission for &ndash; Ibn Khald<U+016B>n was able to leave Tunis and sail to [[Alexandria]].

===Last years in Egypt===
Ibn Khaldun said of Egypt, "He who has not seen it does not know the power of Islam." While other Islamic regions had to cope with border wars and inner strife, under the [[Mamluk]]s Egypt experienced a period of economic prosperity and high culture. However, even in Egypt, where Ibn Khald<U+016B>n lived out his days, he could not stay out of politics completely. In 1384 the Egyptian Sultan, al-Malik udh-Dhahir Barquq, made him Professor of the Qamhiyyah Madrasah, and grand [[Qadi]] of the [[Maliki]] school of [[fiqh]] (one of four schools, the Maliki school was widespread primarily in West Africa). His efforts at reform encountered resistance, however, and within a year he had to resign his judgeship. A contributory factor to his decision to resign may have been the heavy personal blow that struck him in 1384, when a ship carrying his wife and children sank off the coast of Alexandria. Ibn Khaldun now decided to complete the pilgrimage to Makkah after all.

After his return in May 1388, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n concentrated more strongly on a purely educational function at various Cairo madrasas. At court he fell out of favor for a time, as during revolts against Barquq he had &ndash; apparently under duress &ndash; together with other Cairo jurists issued a [[Fatwa]] against Barquq. Later relations with Barquq returned to normal, and he was once again named the Maliki ''qadi''. Altogether he was called six times to this high office, which for various reasons he never held long.

In 1401, under Barquq's successor, his son Faraj, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n took part in a military campaign against the [[Mongols|Mongol]] conqueror [[Timur]], who besieged [[Damascus]]. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n cast doubt upon the viability of the venture and didn't really want to leave Egypt. His doubts were vindicated, as the young and inexperienced Faraj, concerned about a revolt in Egypt, left his army to its own devices in [[Syria]] and hurried home. Ibn Khald<U+016B>n remained at the besieged city for seven weeks, being lowered over the city wall by ropes in order to negotiate with Timur, in a historic series of meetings which he reports extensively in his autobiography. Timur questioned him in detail about conditions in the lands of the Maghreb; at his request, Ibn Khald<U+016B>n even wrote a long report about it. As he recognized the intentions behind this, he did not hesitate, on his return to Egypt, to compose an equally extensive report on the history of the [[Tartars]], together with a character study of Timur, sending these to the Merinid rulers in Fez (Maghreb).

Ibn Khald<U+016B>n spent the following five years in Cairo completing his autobiography and his history of the world and acting as teacher and judge. During this time he is alleged to have joined an underground party named [[Rijal Hawa Rijal]]. Their reform oriented ideals attracted the attention of local political authorities and the elderly Ibn Khaldun was placed under arrest. He died on 19 March 1406, one month after his sixth selection for the office of the Maliki ''qadi'' (Judge).

Ibn Khald<U+016B>n has left behind few works other than his history of the world, ''al-Kit<U+0101>bu l-<U+02BB>ib<U+0101>r''. Significantly, such writings are not alluded to in his autobiography, suggesting perhaps that Ibn Khald<U+016B>n saw himself first and foremost as a historian and wanted to be known above all as the author of ''al-Kit<U+0101>bu l-<U+02BB>ib<U+0101>r''. From other sources we know of several other works, primarily composed during the time he spent in [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus]]. His first book, ''Lub<U+0101>bu l-Muhassal'', a commentary on the [[Islamic theology]] of [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], was written at the age of 19 under the supervision of his teacher al-<U+0100>bil<U+012B> in Tunis. A work on [[Sufism]], ''Sif<U+0101>'u l-S<U+0101>'il'', was composed around 1373 in [[Fes, Morocco]]. Whilst at the court of [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada]], Ibn Khald<U+016B>n composed a [[Logic in Islamic philosophy|work on logic]], ''<U+02BB>allaqa li-l-Sult<U+0101>n''.

The ''Kit<U+0101>bu l-<U+02BB>ib<U+0101>r'' (full title: ''Kit<U+0101>bu l-<U+02BB>ib<U+0101>r wa Diw<U+0101>nu l-Mubtada' wa l-<U+0126>abar f<U+012B> Ayy<U+0101>mu l-<U+02BB>arab wa l-<U+0100>jam wa l-Barbar wa man <U+02BB><U+0100>sarahum min <U+0110>awIu s-Sult<U+0101>nu l-Akb<U+0101>r'' "''Book of Evidence, Record of Beginnings and Events from the Days of the Arabs, Persians and Berbers and their Powerful Contemporaries''"), Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's main work, was originally conceived as a history of the [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Later, the focus was widened so that in its final form (including its own [[methodology]] and [[anthropology]]), to represent a so-called "[[universal history]]". It is divided into seven books, the first of which, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', can be considered a separate work. Books two to five cover the [[World History|history of mankind]] up to the time of Ibn Khald<U+016B>n. Books six and seven cover the history of the [[Berber people]]s and the [[Maghreb]], which remain invaluable to present-day historians, as they are based on Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's personal knowledge of the Berbers.<ref>Recently there has been a tendency to modify this view. Ibn Khaldun relied not just on his own research, but for the history of the Berber tribes utilized a large number of written sources including many of poor quality (e.g. the ''[[Rawd al-Qirtas]]''). He has been criticised for often presenting only a synthesis of multiple (sometimes contradictory) sources where a more careful historian such as [[ar-Raqiq]] or [[al-Maliki]] would always give the original texts before pronouncing an opinion. See articles by Mod<U+00E9>ran and Benabb<U+00E8>s in ''Identit<U+00E9>s et Cultures dans l'Alg<U+00E9>rie Antique'', University of Rouen, 2005 (ISBN 2-87775-391-3). This criticism applies only to his factual work, not to the theoretical parts like the ''[[Muqaddimah]]''</ref>

Concerning the discipline of [[sociology]], he conceived a theory of [[social conflict]]. He developed the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the concept of a "generation," and the inevitable loss of power that occurs when desert warriors conquer a city. Following a contemporary Arab scholar, Sati' al-Husri, the Muqaddimah may be read as a sociological work:  six books of general sociology. Topics dealt with in this work include politics, urban life, economics, and knowledge. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of '''[[asabiyyah]]'', which has been translated as "[[social cohesion]]", "group solidarity", or "[[tribalism]]". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds &ndash; psychological, sociological, economic, political &ndash; of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Ibn Khaldun has been cited as a racist, but his theories on the rise and fall of empires had no racial component, and this reading of his work has been claimed to be the result of mistranslations.<ref>http://www.jstor.org/pss/3590803 Translation and the Colonial Imaginary: Ibn Khaldun Orientalist, by Abdelmajid Hannoum  <U+00A9> 2003 Wesleyan University.</ref>

Perhaps the most frequently cited observation drawn from Ibn Khald<U+016B>n's work is the notion that when a society becomes a great civilization (and, presumably, the dominant culture in its region), its high point is followed by a period of decay. This means that the next cohesive group that conquers the diminished civilization is, by comparison, a group of [[barbarians]]. Once the barbarians solidify their control over the conquered society, however, they become attracted to its more refined aspects, such as literacy and arts, and either assimilate into or appropriate such cultural practices. Then, eventually, the former barbarians will be conquered by a new set of barbarians, who will repeat the process.  Some contemporary readers of Khaldun have read this as an early [[business cycle]] theory, though set in the historical circumstances of the mature Islamic empire.  

Ibn Khaldun's outlines an early (possibly even the earliest) example of political economy. He describes the economy as being composed of value-adding processes; that is, labour and skill is added to techniques and crafts and the product is sold at a higher value.  He also made the distinction between "profit" and "sustenance", in modern political economy terms, surplus and that required for the reproduction of classes respectively.  He also calls for the creation of a science to explain society and goes on to outline these ideas in his major work the Muqaddimah.

== Legacy ==
Ibn Khaldun was first brought to the attention of the [[Western world]] in 1697, when a biography of him appeared in [[Barth<U+00E9>lemy d'Herbelot de Molainville]]'s ''Biblioth<U+00E8>que Orientale''. Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when [[Silvestre de Sacy]]'s ''Chrestomathie Arabe'' included his biography together with a translation of parts of the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' as the ''Prolegomena''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9839541536|page=118|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the ''Prolegomena''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9839541536|pages=118<U+2013>9|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> More details on and partial translations of the ''Prolegomena'' emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858, followed by a complete French translation a few years later by de Sacy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9839541536|page=119|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibn Khaldun: His Life and Works|first=Muhammed Abdullah|last=Enan|publisher=[[The Other Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9839541536|pages=119<U+2013>20|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>

* British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] called the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' "a [[philosophy of history]] which is undoubtedly the greatest work of its kind that has ever yet been created by any mind in any time or place."<ref name=Britannica>''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'', 15th ed., vol. 9, p. 148.</ref> Much of his own work on world history was inspired by Ibn Khaldun.

* The British philosopher [[Robert Flint]] wrote the following on Ibn Khaldun: "As a [[theorist]] on [[history]] he had no equal in any age<U+2026> [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] were not his peers."<ref name=Britannica/>

* [[Egon Orowan]], who termed the concept of ''[[socionomy]]'', developed the writings of Ibn Khaldun to forecast an eventual failure of market [[supply and demand|demand]].

* In 2006, the [[Atlas Economic Research Foundation]] launched an annual essay contest [http://www.atlasusa.org/V2/main/page.php?page_id=741] for Muslim students named in Ibn Khaldun's honor. The theme of the contest is "how individuals, think tanks, universities and entrepreneurs can influence government policies to allow the free market to flourish and improve the lives of its citizens based on Islamic teachings and traditions."
