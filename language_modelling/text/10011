'''Josephine Bernadette Devlin McAliskey''' (born 23 April 1947, in [[County Tyrone]], Northern Ireland), usually known as '''Bernadette Devlin''' or '''Bernadette McAliskey''', is an Irish [[socialist]] and [[Irish republicanism|republican]] political activist. She served as a [[Member of Parliament|Member of the UK Parliament]] from 1969 to 1974 for the [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster constituency]], in which role she famously slapped the Home Secretary [[Reginald Maudling]] as a reaction to his comments on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]]. She lost her seat to [[John Dunlop (Unionist politician)|John Dunlop]] of the then-[[Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party]], after coming third in a four-sided contest in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election of February 1974]].<ref>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/election-2011/mid-ulster-elections-results-19502010-14756770.html</ref>

==Political beginnings==

Devlin was born in [[Cookstown]], County Tyrone and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. She attended St Patrick's Girls Academy in [[Dungannon]].<ref>CAIN: Biographies of Prominent People - Mc</ref> She was studying [[Psychology]] at [[Queen's University Belfast]] in 1968 when she took a prominent role in a student-led [[civil rights]] organisation, [[People's Democracy]].<ref name="Independent">{{cite news|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081211164929/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bernadette-mcaliskey-return-of-the-roaring-girl-951825.html|archivedate=11-12-2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/bernadette-mcaliskey-return-of-the-roaring-girl-951825.html|title=Bernadette McAliskey: Return of the Roaring Girl|last=Moreton|first=Cole|date=2008-10-05|work=Independent on Sunday|accessdate=2008-10-05|location=London}}</ref> Devlin was subsequently excluded from the university.<ref name="Independent"/> She stood unsuccessfully against [[James Chichester-Clark]] in the [[Northern Ireland general election, 1969|Northern Ireland general election of 1969]]. When [[George Forrest (politician)|George Forrest]], the MP for Mid Ulster, died, she fought the [[Mid Ulster by-election, 1969|subsequent by-election]] on the "[[Unity (Northern Ireland)|Unity]]" [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], defeating a female Unionist candidate, Forrest's widow Anna, and was elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]]. At age 21, she was the [[Baby of the House|youngest MP at the time]], and remains the youngest woman elected.<ref name="Independent"/>

Devlin stood on the slogan "I will take my seat and fight for your rights" &ndash; signalling her rejection of the traditional Irish republican tactic of [[abstentionism]] (being absent from Westminster). She made her [[maiden speech]] on her 22nd birthday, within an hour of taking her seat.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/apr/22/northern-ireland#S5CV0782P0_19690422_HOC_271] Maiden speech in Commons 1969</ref>

==The Troubles==

===The Battle of the Bogside===

===Bloody Sunday===
Having witnessed the events of [[Bloody Sunday (Northern Ireland 1972)|Bloody Sunday]], Devlin was infuriated that she was later consistently denied the floor in Parliament, despite the fact that parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it therein.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daughters of Ireland|author=Ros Wynne-Jones|url=http://findArticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970309/ai_n14092582/pg_2|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=9 March 1997|accessDate=2007-06-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080524113024/http://findArticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970309/ai_n14092582/pg_2|archivedate=2008-05-24}}</ref>

===IRSP===
McAliskey helped to form the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] along with [[Seamus Costello]] in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This was a revolutionary socialist breakaway from [[Official Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] and paralleled the [[Irish National Liberation Army]]'s split from the [[Official Irish Republican Army]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Holland, Jack|coauthor=McDonald, Henry|title=''INLA Deadly Divisions''|publisher=Poolbeg|year=1996|page= 49|isbn=1-85371-263-9}}</ref> She served on the party's national executive in 1975, but resigned when a proposal that the INLA become subordinate to the party executive was defeated.<ref>[http://irelandsown.net/costello2.html]</ref>{{dead link|date=May 2012}} In 1977, she joined the [[Independent Socialist Party (Ireland)|Independent Socialist Party]], but it disbanded the following year.<ref>Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organisations'', Pinter Publishers (March 2000), ISBN 1855672642</ref>

===Support for hunger strike prisoners===

===Injured in loyalist shooting===
On 16 January 1981, she and her husband were shot by members of the [[Ulster Defence Association|Ulster Freedom Fighters]], who broke into their home in [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]].<ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch81.htm#Jan Chronology of the Conflict: January 1981], CAIN</ref><ref>Peter Taylor, ''Loyalists'', p. 168</ref> The gunmen shot McAliskey a total of seven times in front of her children.<ref>CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict: January 1981</ref> British soldiers were watching the McAliskey home at the time, but failed to prevent the assassination attempt.<ref name=Independent/><ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Taylor (Journalist)|title=''Loyalists''|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=1999|page=168|isbn=0-7475-4519-7}}</ref> An army patrol of the [[3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]] heard the shots and rushed to McAliskey's house. The paramilitaries had torn out the telephone and while the wounded couple were being given first aid by the troops, a soldier ran to a neighbour's house, commandeered a car, and drove to the home of a councillor to telephone for help. The couple were taken by helicopter to hospital in nearby [[Dungannon]] for emergency treatment and then to the [[Musgrave Park Hospital]] in Belfast under [[intensive care]]. Three attackers, including [[Ray Smallwoods]], captured by the army patrol, were subsequently jailed.<ref name="guardian">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/fromthearchive/story/0,12269,1124657,00.html "Devlin is 'very ill' after shooting"], ''The Guardian'', 17 January 1981</ref><ref>[[Peter Taylor (journalist)|Peter Taylor]], ''Loyalists'', London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p168</ref>

==Denied entry into the US==
In 2003, she was barred from entering the United States and deported on the grounds that the [[State Department]] had declared that she "poses a serious threat to the security of the United States"<ref name="CP" />, &mdash; apparently referring to her conviction for incitement to riot in 1969 &mdash; although she protested that she had no terrorist involvement and had frequently been permitted to travel to the United States in the past.<ref name="CP">[http://www.counterpunch.org/flanders02222003.html "Bernadette Devlin McAliskey Barred Entry to the United States"], ''Counterpunch'', 22 February 2003{{rs|date=January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/mar2003/devl-m05.shtml|title=World Socialist News|publisher=Wsws.org|accessdate=2010-06-17}}{{rs|date=January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0MKY/is_6_27/ai_111012328|title=Bernadette Devlin banned from USA &#124; Catholic New Times &#124; Find Articles at BNET|publisher=Findarticles.com|date=2003-04-06|accessdate=2010-06-17}}{{dead|date=January 2013}}</ref>
