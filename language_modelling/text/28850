The '''Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede''' was a [[steam power]]ed [[velocipede]] made in France sometime from 1867 to 1871, when a small [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]] commercial steam engine was attached to a [[Pierre Michaux]] manufactured iron framed pedal bicycle.<ref name=Falco1999>{{Citation |last1=Falco |first1=Charles M. |year= 1998 |authorlink=Charles M.

==First motorcycle?==
Motoring author [[L. J. K. Setright]] commented that, "the simplest way to define a motorcycle is as a bicycle propelled by a [[heat engine]]; and if we accept this we must go on to admit that its prototype is unidentifiable, shrouded in the mists of industrial antiquity."<ref name=Setright1979/> Both the Michaux-Perreaux and Roper machines have been assigned years of origin of 1867, 1868, and 1869 by different authorities, and which combination of these three years is given to the two steam motorcycles determines whether it was a tie, or whether one can be called the first.

Both steam cycles are rejected as the first motorcycle by other experts, such as ''[[Cycle World]]'''s Technical Editor [[Kevin Cameron (journalist)|Kevin Cameron]], who either argue that a true motorcycle must use a gasoline internal combustion engine,<ref name=Brown2005>{{Citation |last=Brown |first=Roland |year=2005 |title=The Ultimate History of Fast Motorcycles |publisher=[[Parragon]] |isbn=1-4054-5466-0 |location=[[Bath, England]] |page=6&ndash;7}}</ref> or that the first motorcycle must use the same technology as the successful motorcycles that later went into mass production, and not a 'dead end'. They therefore give credit to [[Wilhelm Maybach]] and [[Gottlieb Daimler]]'s 1885 Daimler Reitwagen.<ref name=Kerr2008/> 

After the period of experimental steam and internal combustion motorcycles, the uncertainty dissolves on the question of the first production motorcycle. The {{Convert|1489|cc|abbr=on}} [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid cooled]] [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] [[Hildebrand & Wolfm<U+00FC>ller]] of 1894 was the first motorcycle produced in quantity and sold commercially.<ref name=Brown2004>{{Citation |last=Brown |year=2004 |first=Roland |title=History of the Motorcycle: From the first motorized bicycles to the powerful and sophisticated superbikes of today |publisher=[[Parragon]] |location=[[Bath, England]] |isbn=1-4054-3952-1 |pages=10&ndash;11, 14&ndash;15 |postscript= <br>Michaux-Perreaux patented 1868.

===Definition of first motorcycle===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and others include having an internal combustion engine as a criterion for a motorcycle.<ref name=Kresnak2008/><ref name=Long2007>{{Cite news |last=Long |first=Tony |date=30 August 2007 |title=Aug.&nbsp;30, 1885: Daimler Gives World First 'True' Motorcycle |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/08/dayintech_0830 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)]] |issn=1059-1028 }}</ref><ref name=OED>{{Cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=March 2009 |chapter=motorcycle, n. |quote= 1. A two-wheeled motor-driven road vehicle, resembling a bicycle but powered by an internal-combustion engine; (now) spec. one with an engine capacity, top speed, or weight greater than that of a moped.}}</ref> This definition of motorcycle worked for nearly the entire 20th century until [[electric motorcycle|electric]] and [[diesel motorcycle]]s grew in prominence and were accepted as true motorcycles without question.<ref name=Kerr2008/>

A different tack in favor of the internal combustion Reitwagen is that it was the prototype for virtually all successful designs that followed, in so far as the powerplant is concerned. Cameron said, "History follows things that succeed, not things that fail."<ref name=Kerr2008/> Design columnist Glynn Kerr, ignoring the Michaux-Perraux altogether and championing the Roper, feels it would be more accurate to call the Daimler Reitwagen, "the predecessor of all gasoline-driven vehicles on land, sea, or air," but not a true motorcycle because it used two outrigger wheels to remain upright and could not lean.<ref name=Kerr2008/> Further, Kerr notes the design was not up to the standards Daimler and Maybach's engineering skill, because they had no interest at the time in motorcycles, but only wanted an expedient test bed for their engine, and immediately dropped the Reitwagen in favor of a four wheeled stagecoach, a hot air balloon and a boat for their ongoing research.<ref name=Kerr2008/> David Burgess-Wise called the Daimler-Maybach test bed "a crude makeshift", saying that "as a bicycle, it was 20 years out of date."<ref name=Burgess-Wise1973/>
