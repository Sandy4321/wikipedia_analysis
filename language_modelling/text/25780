Originally either the property of a local notable or attached to a larger church, it was constructed anytime from the 11th to the 14th century. 

The church was built using red bricks and white mortar. Architectural it consists of a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cross-in-square]] design, with a single [[nave]] and [[apse]]. It repaired in 1937 after falling into ruin; and was listed as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968.

Due to its diminutive size, the Church of St Nicholas was probably not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church to the name of an unidentified local [[feudalism|feudal lord]] named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers it more likely that it was possibly a [[chapel]] or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship.<ref name="mavrodinov">{{cite book|last=<U+041C><U+0430><U+0432><U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>|first=<U+041D><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+0430>|title=<U+0415><U+0434><U+043D><U+043E><U+043A><U+043E><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+043D><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0438> <U+043A><U+0440><U+044A><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0434><U+043D><U+0430><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0446><U+044A><U+0440><U+043A><U+0432><U+0430> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0431><U+044A><U+043B><U+0433><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435> <U+0437><U+0435><U+043C><U+0438> <U+0434><U+043E> <U+043A><U+0440><U+0430><U+044F> <U+043D><U+0430> XIV <U+0432><U+0435><U+043A>|year=1931|publisher=<U+0414><U+044A><U+0440><U+0436><U+0430><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+043F><U+0435><U+0447><U+0430><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>|location=<U+0421><U+043E><U+0444><U+0438><U+044F>|oclc=174158454|language=Bulgarian}}</ref> The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.<ref name="journeybg"/>

In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov also writes that at the time, the church lacked a roof. He references a story about a group of [[Circassians]] that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the [[Crimean War]] (1853<U+2013>1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof. However, one of them fell to his death inside the church, so they fled in horror.<ref name="spravochnik"/><ref name="journeybg"/><ref name="mavrodinov"/> The church was thoroughly reconstructed in 1937 by a team under architect Rashenov.<ref name="spravochnik"/><ref name="journeybg"/>
