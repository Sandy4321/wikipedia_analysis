The '''Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo''' was a land battle of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]], between [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] (mainly [[United States Marine Corps|United States (U.S.) Marine]]) ground forces. It took place [[August 7]] <U+2013> [[August 9]], [[1942]], on the [[Solomon Islands]], during the initial Allied landings in the [[Guadalcanal campaign]].

In the battle, U.S. Marines, under the overall command of U.S. [[Major General]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], successfully landed and captured the islands of [[Tulagi]], [[Gavutu]], and [[Tanambogo]] among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and seaplane base. The landings were fiercely resisted by the Japanese Navy troops who, outnumbered and outgunned by the Allied forces, fought and died almost to the last man.

At the same time that the landings on Tulagi and Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby [[Guadalcanal]], with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces.  In contrast to the intense fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed.  The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.

==Background==
On [[December 7]], [[1941]], [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|the Japanese attacked]] the U.S. Pacific fleet at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. The attack crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet and initiated a formally declared state of war between the two nations. The initial goals of Japanese leaders in the war were to neutralize the U.S. fleet, seize possessions rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases to defend Japan's empire in Asia and the Pacific. In support of these goals, Japanese forces attacked and took control of the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], the [[Dutch East Indies]], [[Wake Island]], [[New Britain]], and [[Guam]].<ref>Murray, ''War to be Won'', p. 169<U+2013>195.</ref>

Two attempts by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] (May 1942) and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them with an opportunity to take the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific.<ref>Murray, ''War to be Won'', p. 196.</ref> The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida as the location for their first offensive.<ref>Loxton, ''Shame of Savo'', p. 3.</ref>

As part of the offensive that resulted in the Coral Sea battle, the Japanese Navy sent troops to [[Japanese Tulagi landing (1942)|occupy Tulagi]] and nearby islands in the southern Solomons.  These troops, mainly members of the 3d Kure [[Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces|Special Naval Landing Force]], occupied Tulagi on [[May 3]], [[1942]], and constructed a seaplane, ship refueling, and communications base on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Gavutu, Tanambogo and Florida, all of which were soon operational.  Aware of the Japanese efforts on Tulagi, the Allies' concern increased in early July 1942 when the Japanese Navy began constructing a large airfield near [[Lunga Point]] on nearby Guadalcanal.  By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 troops on Tulagi and nearby islands, and 2,800 personnel (many of whom were [[Korean people|Korean]] construction specialists) on Guadalcanal.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 23<U+2013>31, 129, 628.</ref> The airfield, when complete, would protect Japan's major base at [[Rabaul]], threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for possible future offensives against [[Fiji]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Samoa]].

He proposed the offensive to deny the use of the southern Solomon islands by the Japanese as [[Military base|bases]] to threaten the [[materiel|supply]] routes between the U.S. and [[Australia]], and to use them as starting points for a [[Military campaign|campaign]] with the objective of isolating the major Japanese base at [[Rabaul]] while also supporting the Allied [[New Guinea campaign]], with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines.<ref>Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 12.</ref>  U.S. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], Allied commander in chief for Pacific forces, created the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]] theater, with U.S. Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]] in command, to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons.<ref>Murray, ''War to be Won'', p. 199<U+2013>200.</ref> 

In preparation for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift]] was ordered to move his [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] from the U.S. to [[New Zealand]].  Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia.<ref>Loxton, ''Shame of Savo'', p. 5.</ref>  [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] was selected as the headquarters and main base for the impending offensive, codenamed ''Operation Watchtower,'' with the commencement date set for [[August 7]], [[1942]].  At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and the [[Santa Cruz Islands]], omitting Guadalcanal.  However, after Allied reconnaissance discovered the Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, capture of that airfield was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 35<U+2013>37, 53.</ref>

The Allied ''Watchtower'' expeditionary force of 75 warships and transports, which included vessels from both the U.S. and Australia, assembled near Fiji on [[July 26]], [[1942]], and engaged in one rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on [[July 31]].<ref>Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 15.</ref><ref>McGee, ''The Solomons Campaigns'', p. 20<U+2013>21.</ref>  Vandegrift was the overall commander of the 16,000 Allied (primarily U.S. Marine) ground forces involved in the landings and personally commanded the assault on Guadalcanal.  In command of the 3,000 U.S. Marines set to land on Tulagi and the nearby islands of Florida, Gavutu, and Tanambogo was U.S. [[Brigadier General]] [[William H. Rupertus]] on the transport ship [[USS Neville (APA-9)|''Neville'']].<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 57, 619<U+2013>621, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 129.</ref>

===Prelude to battle===
[[Image:TulagiGavutuLandings.gif|325 px|thumb|right|Routes of Allied amphibious forces for landings on Florida, Tulagi, and Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo, [[August 7]], [[1942]].]]
Bad weather allowed the Allied expeditionary force to arrive in the vicinity of Guadalcanal unseen by the Japanese on the morning of [[August 7]].  The Japanese detected the radio traffic from the incoming Allied invasion force and prepared to send scout aircraft aloft at daybreak.<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 77, McGee, ''The Solomons Campaigns'', p. 21.</ref>  The landing force ships split into two groups, with one group assigned for the assault on Guadalcanal and the other tasked with the assault on Tulagi, Florida, and Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 60.</ref>  Aircraft from the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Wasp (CV-7)|USS ''Wasp'']] dive-bombed Japanese installations on Tulagi, Gavutu, Tanambogo, and Florida and strafed and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes floating in the anchorages near the islands.  Several of the seaplanes were warming their engines in preparation for takeoff and were lost with their aircrews and many of their support personnel.<ref>Hammel, ''Carrier Clash'', p. 46<U+2013>47, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 78, and Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38.</ref>  The cruiser [[USS San Juan (CL-54)|''San Juan'']] and destroyers [[USS Monssen (DD-436)|''Monssen'']] and [[USS Buchanan (DD-484)|''Buchanan'']] bombarded planned landing sites on Tulagi and Florida Island.  To cover the assaults on Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, U.S. Marines from the [[1st Battalion, 2nd Marines|1st Battalion]], [[2nd Marine Regiment (United States)|2nd Marine Regiment]] made an unopposed landing on Florida Island at 07:40.  They were guided to their objective by several Australians who were familiar with the Tulagi-Florida area from having previously lived and worked in the area.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 26<U+2013>27, Peatross, ''Bless 'em All'', p. 36, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 96, 124<U+2013>125.  None of the Japanese troops on Tulagi were killed in the pre-landing bombings or warship bombardment.  At 10:04, while bombarding Gavutu, a powder charge exploded on ''San Juan'', killing seven crewmen and wounding 11.</ref>

==Battle of Tulagi==<!-- This section is linked from [[Commando]] -->
At 08:00, two [[battalion]]s of U.S. Marines, including the [[Marine Raiders|1st Raider Battalion]] under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Merritt A. Edson]] (Edson's Raiders), and the [[2nd Battalion 5th Marines|2nd Battalion, 5th Marines]] (2/5) made an unopposed landing on the western shore of Tulagi about halfway between the two ends of the oblong-shaped island.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 72<U+2013>73.</ref> Beds of coral near the shore kept the landing craft from reaching the shoreline.  The Marines, however, were able to wade the remaining 100 meters without hindrance from the Japanese forces, who were apparently taken by surprise by the landings and had yet to begin any organized resistance.  At this time, the Japanese forces on Tulagi and Gavutu, a detachment of the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF) plus members of the Yokohama Air Group, commanded by Captain [[Shigetoshi Miyazaki]], signaled their commander at Rabaul, Captain [[Sadayoshi Yamada]], that they were under attack, were destroying their equipment and papers, and signed off with the message, "Enemy troop strength is overwhelming, We will defend to the last man."  Masaaki Suzuki, commander of the SNLF unit, ordered his troops into pre-prepared defensive positions on Tulagi and Gavutu.<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 80, 133<U+2013>134, Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 27<U+2013>28, and Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38.  This detachment of the 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force may have reported to the 5th Air Attack Force or it may have reported to the 8th Fleet under [[Gunichi Mikawa]].  The 3rd Kure SNLF mainly consisted of recalled reservists and most were over 40 years old.  Also on Tulagi were Japanese electricians and engineers from the 14th Construction Unit who, although not combat trained, assisted the 3rd Kure in the defense of the island.</ref>

[[Image:TulagiBattle1942.gif|275px|thumb|left|Map overlay on an aerial photo of Tulagi showing U.S. Marine advance on the southeastern end of the island and the center of Japanese resistance around Hill 281.]] Marines of 2/5 secured the northwest end of Tulagi without opposition and then joined Edson's Raiders in their advance towards the southeastern end of the island.  The Marines advanced towards the southeast end of the island throughout the day while defeating a few isolated pockets of Japanese resistance.  Around noon, Suzuki repositioned his main defenses into a line {{coord|9|6|26|S|160|8|56|E|name=Hill 281|display=inline}} on a hill <U+2014> called Hill&nbsp;281 (Hill&nbsp;280 in some sources) by U.S. forces because of its elevation <U+2014> and a nearby ravine located at the southeast end of the island.  The Japanese defenses included dozens of tunneled caves dug into the hill's limestone cliffs and machinegun pits protected by sandbags.  The Marines reached these defenses near dusk, realized that they did not have enough daylight left for a full-scale attack, and dug in for the night.<ref>Peatross, ''Bless 'em All'', p. 37<U+2013>41, Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 28<U+2013>31, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 82, 131, 138<U+2013>139.</ref>

During the night, the Japanese attacked the Marine lines five times, beginning at 22:30.<ref>Shaw, ''First Offensive'', p. 8<U+2013>9, Peatross, ''Bless 'em All'', p. 41, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 140.</ref>  The attacks consisted of frontal charges along with individual and small group infiltration efforts towards Edson's command post that at times resulted in [[hand to hand combat]] with the Marines.  In spite of taking a few casualties, however, the Marine lines held.<ref>Hoffman, ''Marine Raiders'', Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 33, Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 77<U+2013>78, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 140.</ref>  Describing the Japanese attacks that took place during the night, eyewitness raider Marine Pete Sparacino said, {{Blockquote|"...full darkness set in.  There was movement to the front...you could hear them jabbering.  Then, the enemy found a gap and began running through the opening.  The gap was (sealed) when another squad closed the gate.  Some Japanese had crawled within 20 yards of (Frank) Guidone's squad.  Frank began throwing grenades from a prone position.  His grenades were going off 15 yards from our position (and) we had to duck as they exploded.  The enemy was all around.  It was brutal and deadly.  We had to be careful not to kill our comrades.  We were tired but had to stay awake or be dead."<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 135.</ref>}}

At daybreak on [[August 8]], six Japanese infiltrators hiding under the porch of the former British colonial headquarters shot and killed three Marines.  Within five minutes other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades.  Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements in the form of the [[2nd Battalion 2nd Marines|2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines]] (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine, pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine.<ref>Hoffman, ''Marine Raiders''.</ref>  Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed.  Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 33.</ref>  In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died.  Three Japanese were taken prisoner.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 77<U+2013>78.</ref>

==Battle of Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo==
[[Image:GavutuBattle1942.gif|300px|thumb|right|Map overlay on an aerial photo showing the U.S. Marine assaults on Gavutu and Tanambogo.]]The nearby [[islet]]s of [[Gavutu]] and Tanambogo housed the Japanese seaplane base as well as 536 Japanese naval personnel from the Yokohama Air Group and 3rd Kure Special Naval Landing Force and Korean and Japanese civilians from the 14th Construction Unit.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 628, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 150.  The 14th Construction Unit was divided into the Hashimoto and Hara Construction Forces.</ref>  The two islets were basically mounds of coral, both about 42 meters (140 ft) high, and connected to each other by a 500 meter-long [[causeway]].<ref>Hough, ''Pearl Harbor to Guadalcanal'', p. 266<U+2013>267.</ref>  The Japanese on both islets were well entrenched in bunkers and caves.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 61.</ref>  Also, the two islets were mutually supportive since each was in machine gun range of the other.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 34.</ref>

At 12:00 on [[August 7]], Gavutu was assaulted by the [[Paramarines|U.S. Marine 1st Parachute Battalion]] consisting of 397 men.  The preceding naval bombardment had damaged the seaplane ramp, forcing the Marine landing craft to land the Marines in a more exposed location on a nearby dock at {{coord|9|6|53.30|S|160|11|19.20|E|name=Gavutu Landing|display=inline|type=landmark}}.  Japanese machine gun fire began inflicting heavy casualties, killing or wounding one in ten of the landing Marines as they scrambled inland in an attempt to get out of the crossfire coming from the two islets.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 75<U+2013>76.</ref>  Pushing forward, the Marines were able to secure the top of the hill on Gavutu within a couple of hours and then set to work clearing the Japanese fighting positions on the hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, [[Hand grenade|grenade]]s, and hand-to-hand combat.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 61<U+2013>62, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 156.</ref>  The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 144, Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 35.</ref>

Most of the 240 Japanese defenders on Tanambogo were aircrew and maintenance personnel from the Yokohama Air Group. Rupertus detached one [[Company (military unit)|company]] of Marines from the [[2nd Marine Regiment]] on Florida Island to assist in assaulting Tanambogo, in spite of advice from his staff that one company was not enough.  Incorrectly believing that Tanambogo was only lightly defended, this company attempted an amphibious assault directly on Tanambogo shortly after dark on [[August 7]].  Illuminated by fires started during a U.S. naval bombardment of the islet, the five landing craft carrying the Marines were hit by heavy fire as they approached the shore, with many of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] boatcrews being killed or wounded, as well as heavily damaging three of the boats.  Realizing the position was untenable the Marine company commander ordered the remaining boats to depart with the wounded marines, and he and a dozen men who had already landed sprinted across the causeway to cover on Gavutu.  The Japanese on Tanambogo suffered 10 killed in the day's fighting.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 77, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 160<U+2013>163.</ref>

[[Image:TulagiRupertus.jpg|250px|thumb|left|U.S. Brigadier General Rupertus (center) supervises the assaults on Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo from his command ship on [[August 7]] or [[August 8]].  In the background are landing craft and a U.S. destroyer.]] Throughout the night, as the Japanese staged isolated attacks on the marines on Gavutu under the concealment of heavy thunderstorms, Vandegrift prepared to send reinforcements to assist with the assault on Tanambogo.  The [[3rd Battalion 2nd Marines]] (3/2), still embarked on ships off Guadalcanal, was notified to prepare to assault Tanambogo on [[August 8]].<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 62.</ref>

The 3rd Battalion began landing on Gavutu at 10:00 on [[August 8]] and assisted in destroying the remaining Japanese defenses on that islet, which was completed by 12:00.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 36<U+2013>38.</ref>  Then the 3rd Battalion prepared to assault Tanambogo.  In preparation for the assault, U.S. carrier [[dive bomber]]s and naval gunfire bombardment were requested.  After the carrier aircraft twice accidentally dropped bombs on the U.S. Marines on Gavutu, killing four of them, further carrier aircraft support was canceled.  The ''San Juan'', however, placed its shells on the correct island and shelled Tanambogo for 30 minutes.  The Marine assault began at 16:15, both by landing craft and across the causeway, and, with assistance from two marine [[Stuart tank|Stuart]] light tanks, began making headway against the Japanese defenses.  One of the tanks which became stuck on a stump and isolated from its infantry support was surrounded by a "frenzied mob" of about 50 Japanese airmen.  The Japanese set fire to the tank, killing two of its crew and severely beat the other two crewmembers before most of them were killed by Marine rifle fire.  The Marines later counted 42 Japanese bodies around the burned-out hulk of the tank, including the corpses of the Yokohama executive officer and several of the seaplane pilots.  One of the Japanese survivors of the attack on the tank reported, "I recall seeing my officer Lieutenant Commander Saburo Katsuta on top of the tank.  This was the last time I saw him".<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 178<U+2013>179, 181, Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 78<U+2013>79 and Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38, Gilbert, p. 38.  Lieutenant E. J. Sweeney, the tank platoon commander, was killed during the tank assault as he stood in his tank's turret.  Lundstrom states that Miyazaki was killed in the attack on the tank, but Jersey states that Miyazaki wasn't in the Guadalcanal area at the time and survived the war.</ref>

Throughout the day, the Marines methodically dynamited the caves, destroying most of them by 21:00.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 78<U+2013>79 and Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38.</ref>  The few surviving Japanese conducted isolated attacks throughout the night, with [[hand to hand combat|hand to hand]] engagements occurring.  By noon on [[August 9]], all Japanese resistance on Tanambogo ended.<ref>Zimmerman, ''The Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38.</ref>  In the battle for Gavutu and Tanambogo, 476 Japanese defenders and 70 U.S. Marines or naval personnel died.  Of the 20 Japanese prisoners taken during the battle, most were not actually Japanese combatants but Korean laborers belonging to the Japanese construction unit.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 79, Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 181.  Four members of the Yokohama Air Group were captured.</ref>

==Landings on Guadalcanal==
[[Image:TulagiMarineOfficers.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|The U.S. Marine officers commanding the units that assaulted Tulagi pose for a group photo shortly after the battle.]] In contrast to Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, the landings on Guadalcanal encountered much less resistance.  At 09:10 on [[August 7]], General Vandegrift and 11,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal between Koli Point and Lunga Point.  Advancing towards Lunga Point, they encountered no resistance except for "tangled" rain forest, and halted for the night about 1,000 meters from the Lunga Point airfield.  The next day, again against little resistance, the Marines advanced all the way to the Lunga River and secured the airfield by 16:00 on [[August 8]].  The Japanese naval construction units had abandoned the airfield area, leaving behind food, supplies, and intact construction equipment and vehicles.<ref>Morison, ''Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 15, and Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 61<U+2013>62 & 81.</ref>

==Aftermath==
During the battle, about 80 Japanese escaped from Tulagi and Gavutu<U+2013>Tanambogo by swimming to Florida Island.  They were, however, all hunted-down and killed by Marine and [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force]] patrols over the next two months.<ref>Frank, ''Guadalcanal'', p. 79, and Lundstrom, ''Guadalcanal Campaign'', p. 38.</ref>

The Allies quickly turned the Tulagi anchorage, one of the finest natural harbors in the South Pacific, into a naval base and refueling station.  During the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns, Tulagi served as an important base for Allied naval operations. Since the Japanese exerted control over the nearby seas at night throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, any Allied ships in the Guadalcanal area that could not depart by nightfall usually took refuge in Tulagi's harbor.  Allied ships damaged in the naval battles that occurred between August and December 1942 in the vicinity of Guadalcanal usually anchored in Tulagi's harbor for temporary repairs before heading to rear-area ports for permanent repairs.<ref>Jersey, ''Hell's Islands'', p. 3, Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 93.</ref>

Later in the campaign, Tulagi also became a base for U.S. [[PT boats]] that attempted to interdict Tokyo Express missions by the Japanese to resupply and reinforce their forces on Guadalcanal.  Except for some troops left to build, garrison, operate, and defend the base at Tulagi, however, the majority of the U.S. Marines that had assaulted Tulagi and the nearby islets were soon relocated to Guadalcanal to help defend the airfield, later called [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] by Allied forces, located at Lunga Point, for it was to be on Guadalcanal where all of the future, crucial, land battles in the Guadalcanal campaign would be fought.<ref>Griffith, ''Battle for Guadalcanal'', p. 93.</ref>
