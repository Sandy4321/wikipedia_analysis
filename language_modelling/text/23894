The '''First and Second Battle of Wonju''' ({{lang-fr|Bataille de Wonju}}), also known as the '''Wonju Campaign''' or the '''Third Phase Campaign Eastern Sector'''<ref group group="nb" name=battlename>The Western Sector is the [[Third Battle of Seoul]].</ref> ({{zh|s=<U+7B2C><U+4E09><U+6B21><U+6218><U+5F79><U+4E1C><U+7EBF>|p=D<U+00EC> S<U+0101>n C<U+00EC> Zh<U+00E0>n Y<U+00EC> D<U+014D>ng Xi<U+00E0>n}}), was a series of engagements between [[North Korean]] and [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]] (UN) forces during the [[Korean War]]. The battle took place from December 31, 1950 to January 20, 1951 around the South Korean town of [[Wonju]]. In coordination with the Chinese [[Third Battle of Seoul|capture of Seoul]] on the western front, the [[North Korean People's Army]] attempted to capture Wonju in an effort to destabilize the UN defenses along the central and the eastern fronts.

After a joint Chinese and North Korean assault breached the UN defenses at [[Chuncheon]] on New Year's Eve of 1951, the North Korean  [[V Corps (North Korea)|V Corps]] attacked  the US [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] at Wonju while the North Korean [[II Corps (North Korea)|II Corps]] harassed US X Corps' rear by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]]. In response, the US X Corps under the command of Major General [[Edward Almond]] managed to cripple the North Korean forces at Wonju, and the UN forces later carried out a number of anti-guerrilla operations against the North Korean infiltrators. In the aftermath of the battle, the North Korean forces on the central and the eastern fronts were decimated, allowing the UN front to be stabilized at the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]].

After launching a surprise invasion of [[South Korea]] in June 1950, the [[North Korean People's Army]] (KPA) was shattered by the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|United Nations]] (UN) forces following the [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Incheon]] in September 1950, with the remnants of the KPA fleeing northward while seeking sanctuaries in the mountainous region along the Sino-Korean border.<ref name=millett271>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=271}}.</ref><ref name=appleman368>{{harvnb|Appleman|1989|p=368}}.</ref> The destruction of the KPA prompted China to intervene in the Korean War, and Chinese forces launched [[Korean War#China_intervenes_.28October_.E2.80.93_December_1950.29|a series of surprise attacks]] against the UN forces near the border during November 1950.<ref name="brit">{{cite web | last = Millett | first = Allan R. | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/322419/Korean-War | title = Korean War | year=2009 | publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]] | accessdate = 2010-07-03}}</ref> The resulting battles in the [[Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River|Ch'ongch'on River valley]] and at [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir|Chosin Reservoir]] forced the UN forces to retreat back to the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]] by December 1950.<ref name=mossman160>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=160}}.</ref> On the eastern front, the US [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]] was trapped at the port of [[Hungnam]] near the Chosin Reservoir during the surprise Chinese offensive, and was forced to evacuate North Korea by sea on December 24, 1950.<ref name=mossman104_173>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|pp=104, 173}}.</ref> In its absence, the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army was forced to take over the defenses of the central and the eastern fronts along the 38th parallel,<ref name=mossman161>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=161}}.</ref> including the important road junction of [[Wonju]] located near the central front.<ref name=appleman98>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=98}}.</ref> The sudden defeat of the UN forces offered the decimated KPA a brief respite, and the shattered North Korean forces soon rebuilt their strength at the end of 1950.<ref name=appleman368/>

==Prelude==
===Locations, terrain and weather===
The battle's main focus was around a road dubbed "Route 29", a strategically important [[line of communication]] to the UN forces in central Korea. Wonju was a critical crossroad village on Route 29 which ran north to south and connects [[Chuncheon]] on the 38th parallel with [[Daegu]] on the [[Pusan Perimeter]].<ref name="appleman98"/><ref name=kimh383_384>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=383<U+2013>384}}.</ref> Another road, which ran from the northwest, connected Route 29 and the South Korean capital of [[Seoul]] at Wonju.<ref name=appleman98/> Between Chuncheon and Wonju stood the town of [[Hoengseong]], and from Wonju to Daegu were a series of towns such as [[Chechon]], [[Tanyang]], [[Punggi-eup|Punggi]] and [[Andong]].<ref name=appleman98/><ref name=kimh383>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=383}}.</ref><ref name=mossman218>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=218}}.</ref> The entire road network was situated within the rough hilly terrains of the [[Taebaek Mountains|Taebaek Mountain Range]].<ref name=appleman96>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=96}}.</ref> The fighting around Wonju occurred during some of the worst Korean winter conditions, with temperatures as low as {{convert|-30|<U+00B0>F|<U+00B0>C}} and snow as thick as {{convert|14|inch|cm|abbr=on}} on the ground.<ref name="appleman123"/> Indeed the weather was so cold that metal on artillery pieces would crack, while water could take an hour-and-a-half to boil.<ref name=appleman124>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=124}}.</ref> At times the cold weather alone was enough to stall all military activities, while [[frostbite]] caused more casualties than combat during the course of the battle.<ref name=appleman123/>

===Forces and strategy===
[[File:Chinese Third Phase Campaign map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Chinese Third Phase Campaign|alt=A map with multiple red arrows pressing against a blue line at the 38th parallel]]
Just days before his death, Walker had tried to bolster the defences of the central and eastern sections of the 38th parallel by stretching the South Korean forces from Chuncheon to the Korean east coast.<ref name=mossman161/> Following his instructions, the ROK [[III Corps (South Korea)|III Corps]] was placed around Chuncheon while the ROK [[I Corps (South Korea)|I Corps]] was deployed on the east coast.<ref name=mossman161/> Meanwhile, the ROK [[II Corps (South Korea)|II Corps]], with its strength reduced to a single infantry [[division (military)|division]] in the aftermath of the Ch'ongch'on River battle,<ref name=kimh305_306>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=305<U+2013>306}}.</ref> filled the gap between the ROK I and III Corps.<ref name=mossman161/> However with the absence of the US X Corps, the UN defenses on the central and eastern fronts were stretched thin, and there were gaps between the understrength South Korean units.<ref name=mossman161/><ref name=kimh315>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=315}}.</ref> Because the South Korean forces had suffered nearly 45,000 casualties by the end of 1950,<ref name=millett372>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=372}}.</ref> most of their units were composed of raw recruits with little training,<ref name=appleman368_369>{{harvnb|Appleman|1989|pp=368<U+2013>369}}.</ref> and out of the four South Korean divisions that defended Chuncheon, only one was deemed battle worthy.<ref name=millett383>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=383}}.</ref> Taking advantage of the situation, the North Korean forces had been probing the South Korean lines since mid-December, while thousands of North Korean guerrillas harassed the UN rear area from their mountain hideouts.<ref name=appleman366>{{harvnb|Appleman|1989|p=366}}.</ref> On December 27, 1950, the KPA [[II Corps (North Korea)|II Corps]] managed to move behind the UN defenses by mauling the ROK [[9th Infantry Division (South Korea)|9th Infantry Division]] on the ROK I Corps' left flank at [[Hyon-ri]]. This development threatened to destabilize the entire UN eastern front.<ref name=appleman27_28>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=27, 28}}.</ref><ref name=kimh313_315>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=313<U+2013>315}}.</ref>

In order to defend against the North Korean penetration, Ridgway immediately ordered the US X Corps to reinforce the South Korean defenses.<ref name=appleman96/> However, with most of the US X Corps still assembling at [[Pusan]], the only unit that was available in the Eighth Army's reserve was the US [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], which was still recovering from its earlier losses in the Ch'ongch'on River valley.<ref name=millett383/> On December 28, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend Wonju while placing the division under US X Corps control.<ref name=appleman27_96>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=27, 96}}.</ref> After the US [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] of the US X Corps finished reorganization on December 30, Ridgway ordered Major General [[Edward Almond]], commander of the US X Corps, to develop Route 29 as its main supply route, and the 7th Infantry Division was subsequently tasked with defending it.<ref name=mossman186>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=186}}.</ref>

In coordination with the Chinese assaults against Seoul in the western sector of the Third Phase Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, [[III Corps (North Korea)|III]] and [[V Corps (North Korea)|V Corps]]<U+2014>an estimated total of 61,500 soldiers<U+2014>against the UN forces on the central front.<ref name="kimh383"/><ref name=appleman98_99>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=98<U+2013>99}}.</ref> The North Korean plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps rear as guerrillas and block Route 29.<ref name=appleman98/><ref name="kimh383_384"/> The aim of the offensive was to push the US X Corps back in concert with the Chinese attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the South Korean forces in the Taebaek Mountains.<ref name=kimh383/><ref name=millett387>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=387}}.</ref> As part of the Chinese attacks against Seoul, the Chinese [[42nd Army (People's Republic of China)|42nd]] and [[66th Army (People's Republic of China)|66th Corps]] were deployed near Chuncheon in support of the KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle.<ref name="zhang127"/> Meanwhile the KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for the KPA II and V Corps.<ref name=appleman98/> However, like the South Koreans they were facing, the North Korean forces were also badly depleted and understrength.<ref name=appleman98/> Although the North Koreans fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle,<ref name=millett387/> most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment.<ref name=appleman98/> In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed at the start of the Korean War, the newly rebuilt North Korean formations were poorly trained and armed.<ref name=mossman223>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=223}}.</ref> Nevertheless, the start date of the Third Phase Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday.<ref name="zhang127"/>

[[File:First and Second Battle of Wonju Map.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the North Korean offensive|alt=A map with multiple red arrows running southward]]
On the central front, the ROK III Corps defended the 38th parallel north of [[Gapyeong]] (Kapyong) and Chuncheon.<ref name=kimh360>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=360}}.</ref> Composed of the ROK [[2nd Infantry Division (South Korea)|2nd]], [[5th Infantry Division (South Korea)|5th]], [[7th Infantry Division (South Korea)|7th]] and [[8th Infantry Division (South Korea)|8th Infantry Divisions]], the ROK III Corps placed the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank in the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon.<ref name=kimh360/> The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply.<ref name=kimh360/> North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and caused serious disruption in the rear of the ROK III Corps.<ref name=kimh360/>

As part of the Chinese plan to capture Seoul, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps were tasked with protecting the Chinese left flank by eliminating the ROK 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions,<ref name=cmsa174>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=174}}</ref> while cutting the road between Chuncheon and Seoul.<ref name="zhang127"/> Following instructions, the two Chinese corps struck quickly after midnight on New Year's Eve.<ref name=kimh361>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=361}}.</ref> The PVA 124th Division first penetrated the flanks of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division, then blocked the division's withdrawal route.<ref name=kimh361/><ref name=cmsa180>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|p=180}}.</ref> The trapped ROK 17th and 32nd Regiments of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division were then forced to retreat in disarray.<ref name=kimh361/> With the PVA 66th Corps pressuring the ROK 5th Infantry Division's front, the PVA 124th Division then advanced eastward in the South Korean rear and blocked the ROK 5th Infantry Division's retreat route as well.<ref name=cmsa180/> The maneuver soon left the ROK 36th Regiment of the ROK 5th Infantry Division surrounded by Chinese, and the ROK 36th Regiment had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines using mountain trails.<ref name=kimh361_362>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=361<U+2013>362}}.</ref> By January 1, the ROK III Corps was in full retreat, while the corps' headquarters had lost contact with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions.<ref name=kimh386_387>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=386<U+2013>387}}.</ref> Responding to the crisis on the central front, the ROK III Corps sector's defense was handed over the US X Corps.<ref name="kimh386_387"/>

While the Chinese were making a concentrated attack against the South Korean front, the North Korean forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the South Korean withdrawal route.<ref name=kimh362>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=362}}.</ref> In the days before the Chinese Third Phase Campaign, the KPA II Corps established a major roadblock to the north of Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of the ROK III Corps.<ref name=kimh360/><ref name=appleman30>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=30}}.</ref> In response, the ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the roadblock from both the north and the south, and the roadblock was forced open by January 2.<ref name=kimh363>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=363}}.</ref><ref name=appleman100>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=100}}.</ref> Although the UN forces managed to eliminate a North Korean division at the roadblock, the ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.<ref name=appleman98_146>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=98, 146}}.</ref>

The success of the initial Chinese and North Korean attacks forced the ROK I Corps to abandon its attempts to restore its original defensive position at Hyon-ri,<ref name="kimh363"/> and a large number of North Korean forces soon streamed into the gap between the US 2nd Infantry Division at Wonju and the ROK I Corps on the east coast.<ref name=kimh386_387/> Ridgway interpreted the Sino-Korean attack on the central front as an attempt to surround the UN defenders at Seoul, and he immediately ordered their evacuation on January 3.<ref name=millett384>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|p=384}}.</ref><ref name=appleman58>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=58}}.</ref> On January 5, Ridgway ordered all UN forces to withdraw to the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]] to set up a new defensive line, dubbed "Line D", with the UN forces on central and eastern fronts setting up defenses between Wonju and the coastal city of [[Jumunjin]] (Chumunjin).<ref name=millett384/><ref name=mossman210>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=210}}.</ref> At the same time, the Chinese troops halted their offensive operations with the KPA II and V Corps relieving the PVA 42nd and 66th Corps.<ref name="zhang131"/><ref name=cmsa187_188>{{harvnb|Chinese Military Science Academy|2000|pp=187<U+2013>188}}.</ref>

In the aftermath of the South Korean collapse, the KPA V Corps proceeded to launch frontal attacks against US X Corps while the KPA II Corps infiltrated the UN rear through the area to the east of Wonju.<ref name=mossman219>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=219}}.</ref> The US 2nd Infantry Division's position had now become an exposed northern salient,<ref name=blair611>{{harvnb|Blair|1987|p=611}}.</ref> and its defenses were further hampered by the flat terrain surrounding Wonju.<ref name=appleman113>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=113}}.</ref> However, given the strategic importance of Wonju in controlling central Korea,<ref name="appleman98"/> Ridgway declared that the village was "only second to Seoul" in importance, and therefore must be defended at all cost.<ref name=blair611/> In accordance with Ridgway's instructions, Almond ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to defend the hills north of Wonju, yet Major General Robert B. McClure of the US 2nd Infantry Division believed that the salient was untenable due to the terrain and the low morale of his division.<ref name=appleman100_113>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=100, 113}}.</ref> On January 7, two infantry [[battalion]]s from the KPA V Corps launched an attack against the US 2nd Infantry Division.<ref name=appleman107>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=107}}.</ref> One North Korean battalion managed to infiltrate the American positions disguised as refugees while another battalion launched a frontal assault.<ref name=appleman107/><ref name=mahoney55>{{harvnb|Mahoney|2001|p=55}}.</ref> Yet the weak attack was soon repulsed due to the lack of coordination between the North Korean units, and about 114 infiltrators were later captured.<ref name=appleman104_106>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=104, 106}}.</ref><ref name=mossman220>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=220}}.</ref> Although the North Korean attack inflicted little damage on the Americans, the disruption caused by infiltrators in US 2nd Infantry Division's rear convinced McClure to abandon Wonju on January 7.<ref name=appleman107/> Almond concurred with McClure's decision on the condition that the US 2nd Infantry Division would only retreat {{convert|3|mi|km}} so that Wonju could be controlled by UN artillery fire.<ref name=appleman110_116>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=110, 116}}.</ref> Regardless, McClure ordered the division to retreat more than {{convert|8|mi|km}} south, putting the village out of artillery range.<ref name=appleman116>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=116}}.</ref> With Wonju under North Korean control, the Chinese declared that the Third Phase Campaign had reached a successful conclusion.<ref name=appleman132>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=132}}.</ref>

Freeman]], attacked towards Wonju on January 8.<ref name=appleman117>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=117}}.</ref> The 23rd Infantry Regiment managed to reach within {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}} at the south of Wonju and caught a sleeping North Korea regiment by surprise at Hill 247.<ref name=appleman117/> About 200 North Korean soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, however the alerted North Korean forces soon counterattacked by outflanking the 23rd Infantry Regiment to the east, and the 23rd Infantry Regiment was forced to retreat to avoid encirclement.<ref name=appleman117/>

Encouraged by the heavy North Korean losses during the initial UN attacks, Almond again ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to recapture Wonju on January 9.<ref name=mossman221>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=221}}.</ref> About four infantry battalions from the US 23rd and [[38th Infantry Regiment (United States)|38th Infantry Regiment]] supported by French and Dutch troops advanced toward Wonju on January 9, yet the attack was stalled at Hill 247 due to the cold weather and the lack of air support.<ref name=kimh391/><ref name=appleman121>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=121}}.</ref> As the UN forces tried to dislodge the North Koreans the next day, they were met by six defending North Korean battalions with an estimated strength of 7,000 soldiers.<ref name=appleman121/> Under a heavy snowstorm and with no air support,<ref name=mossman221/> the battle for Hill 247 continued for most of January 10, and the fighting around the [[French Battalion in the Korean War|French Battalion]] of the 23rd Infantry Regiment became particularly fierce.<ref name=appleman121/> At one point, the French Battalion was forced to fend off several North Korean counterattacks with [[bayonet]] charges after running out of ammunition.<ref name="appleman122"/> The French Battalion's action at Wonju impressed Ridgway, who later encouraged all American units in Korea to utilize bayonets in battle.<ref name=appleman122/> The North Koreans tried to encircle the attacking UN forces as the latter began to gain the upper hand, however artillery fire broke up the North Korean formations, and they had suffered an estimated 2,000 casualties in the aftermath of the battle.<ref name=appleman122/> When air support returned on January 11,<ref name=mossman222>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=222}}.</ref> the attacking UN forces inflicted another 1,100 North Korean casualties and captured Hill 247 by January 12.<ref name="appleman123"/> Although the cold weather and the stubborn North Korean defenses prevented the UN forces from entering Wonju, the capture of Hill 247 had put all of Wonju within UN artillery range, and the village soon became a [[no man's land]] under the devastating bombardment.<ref name=appleman122_123>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=122<U+2013>123}}.</ref>

===Anti-guerrilla operations===

Firepower provided by anti-aircraft vehicles such as this one had proven to be invaluable in patrol actions against North Korean guerrillas.<ref name=appleman124/>|alt=Several soldiers working around a machine gun mounted on a half-track]]

Although the capture of Hill 247 had forced the KPA V Corps to abandon Wonju with heavy losses on January 17,<ref name="mossman223"/><ref name=kimh392>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=392}}.</ref> the KPA II Corps' infiltration in the UN rear area had became so serious that it threatened to outflank the entire UN front and force a complete evacuation of Korea by mid-January.<ref name=mossman226>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=226}}.</ref><ref name=appleman129>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=129}}.</ref> With the bulk of the US X Corps tied up to the south of Wonju while the ROK III Corps was in disarray, the front between Wonju and the east coast was undefended, and about 16,000 North Korean soldiers entered the gap while establishing guerrilla bases from Tanyang to Andong.<ref name=kimh393_394_448>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=393<U+2013>394, 448}}.</ref> The battles along the central front soon degenerated into [[irregular warfare]] between [[Company (military)|company]]-sized UN patrols and North Korean guerrilla bands.<ref name=appleman129_134>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=129, 134}}.</ref> In an effort to stabilize the front, Ridgway ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to withdraw from Wonju while pulling the central and eastern fronts back to the area between Wonju and [[Samch'ok]], and this resulted in another {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} retreat.<ref name=appleman132/><ref name=mossman217>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=217}}.</ref> Ridgway also sent the US [[187th Infantry Regiment (United States)|187th Regimental Combat Team]], the US [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry Regiment]], the US [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] and the [[Greek Expeditionary Force (Korea)|Greek Battalion]] to contain North Korean guerrillas east of Route 29 and north of Andong and [[Yeongdeok]].<ref name=appleman120_134>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|pp=120, 134}}.</ref><ref name=mossman224_225>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|pp=224<U+2013>225}}.</ref> About 30,000 American infantry were deployed to the central front by mid-January,<ref name=blair618>{{harvnb|Blair|1987|p=618}}.</ref> and the North Korean guerrillas were blocked in a narrow salient along the hills at the east of Route 29.<ref name=millett387_388>{{harvnb|Millett|2010|pp=387<U+2013>388}}.</ref>

To eliminate the North Korean threat in the UN rear, Almond ordered all X Corps units on Route 29 to launch aggressive patrols to destroy the North Korean supply bases and guerrilla bands.<ref name=mossman225>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=225}}.</ref> Specially trained irregular forces, such as X Corps' Special Action Group, also hunted North Korean units by operating as guerrillas themselves.<ref name=millett387_388/> The constant UN pressure slowly depleted the ammunition and the manpower of the KPA II Corps,<ref name="mossman226"/> while Major General Yu Jai Hung rallied the ROK III Corps and sealed the gap between Wonju and the east coast by January 22.<ref name=kimh442_447>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|pp=442, 447}}.</ref> On January 20, a patrol carried out by the US [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] of the US 2nd Infantry Division managed to reoccupy Wonju without much resistance.<ref name=appleman136>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=136}}.</ref> Lacking reinforcements and supplies, the KPA II Corps was scattered by the end of January, and only 8,600 soldiers from the KPA II Corps managed to survive and retreat back to North Korea.<ref name=kimh448>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=448}}.</ref> The KPA [[10th Division (North Korea)|10th Division]], vanguard of the KPA II Corps, was also annihilated during the UN anti-guerrilla operations.<ref name=kimh449>{{harvnb|Chae|Chung|Yang|2001|p=449}}.</ref>

==Aftermath==
By the end of January, the KPA II Corps was decimated during its guerrilla operations, and its estimated strength was reduced from 16,000 to 8,000.<ref name=appleman99/> The KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated strength was reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 by the end of January.<ref name=appleman99/> In contrast, the UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period.<ref name=ecker73>{{harvnb|Ecker|2005|p=73}}.</ref><ref group=nb>Although the unit-by-unit casualty data provided by Ecker suggested the US casualty number was around 600, the extent of the South Korean losses is unknown due to the lack of records. See Appleman 1989, p. 403.</ref> The defeat of the North Korean army enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern front,<ref name="kimh449"/> and the retreating US Eighth Army on the Korean western front could finally return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured.<ref name=appleman138>{{harvnb|Appleman|1990|p=138}}.</ref> As soon as the US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway immediately ordered the US Eighth Army to launch [[Operation Thunderbolt (1951)|Operation Thunderbolt]] against Chinese and North Korean forces on January 25, 1951.<ref name=appleman138/><ref name=mossman242>{{harvnb|Mossman|1990|p=242}}.</ref>
