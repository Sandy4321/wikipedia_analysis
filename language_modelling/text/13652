'''Technical Illustration''' is the use of [[illustration]] to visually communicate information of a [[technology|technical nature]]. Technical illustrations can be components of [[technical drawing]]s or [[diagram]]s. Technical illustrations in general aim "to generate expressive [[image]]s that effectively convey certain [[information]] via the visual channel to the human observer".<ref name="ViGr05">Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gr<U+00F6>ller (2005). "[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)</ref>

Technical illustrations generally have to describe and explain the subjects to a nontechnical [[audience]]. Therefore the visual image should be accurate in terms of dimensions and proportions, and should provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer<U+2019>s interest and understanding".<ref>[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm www.industriegrafik.com] website, Last modified: Juni 15, 2002.

=== Types of communication ===
Today, technical illustration can be broken down into three categories{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} based on the type of [[communication]]: 

* Communication with the [[general public]] : informs the general public, for example illustrated instructions found in the manuals for automobiles and consumer electronics. This type of technical illustration contains simple terminology and symbols that can be understood by the lay person and is sometimes called creative technical illustration/graphics.

* Specialized [[engineering]] or [[scientific]] communication : used by engineers/scientists to communicate with their peers and in [[specification]]s. This use of technical illustration has its own complex terminology and specialized symbols; examples are the fields of atomic energy, aerospace and military/defense. These areas can be further broken down into disciplines of mechanical, electrical, architectural engineering and many more.

* Communication between highly skilled [[expert]]s : used by engineers to communicate with people who are highly skilled in a field, but who are not engineers. Examples of this type of technical illustration are illustrations found in user/operator documentation. These illustrations can be very complex and have jargon and symbols not understood by the general public, such as illustrations that are part of instructional materials for operating [[CNC]] machinery.

=== Types of drawings ===
Main types of drawings in technical communication are:<ref>Gerald J. Alred et al. (2005) ''The Business Writer's Handbook<U+200E>'' p.172</ref>
* conventional [[Line art|line drawing]]s,
* [[exploded view drawing]]s,
* [[cutaway drawing]]s, and
* [[clip art]] images

== Techniques ==
Technical illustration uses several basic mechanical drawing configurations called axonometric projection. These are: 
* [[Parallel projection]]s (oblique, planometric, isometric, dimetric, and trimetric), and
* many types of [[perspective projection]]s (with one, two, or three [[vanishing point]]s).
Technical illustration and [[computer-aided design]] can also use 3D and solidbody projections, such as [[rapid prototyping]].
*In the natural sciences, "scientific illustration" refers to a style of drawing using stippling and simple line techniques to convey information with a minimum of artistic interpretation.
