The '''St. Louis Jane Doe''' is an unidentified girl who was found murdered on 28 February 1983 in [[St. Louis]], [[St. Louis County, Missouri]]. She has also been nicknamed "'''Hope'''" and the "'''Little Jane Doe'''."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Perkarsky|first1=Michelle|title=Authorities try to locate body of girl, killed & beheaded 30 years ago|url=http://fox4kc.com/2013/06/17/authorities-try-to-locate-body-of-girl-killed-beheaded-30-years-ago/|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Fox4KC|publisher=Fox|date=17 June 2013}}</ref>

==Discovery==
The headless body of an African-American child was found on the afternoon of 28 February 1983 in St. Louis, Missouri.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McClellan|year=1983|first1=Bill|title=Decapitated body of girl found in basement|url=https://identifyus.org/en/medias/full/9142|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Post Dispatch News}}</ref> She was believed to have been strangled three to five days earlier and was then disposed of in the basement of an abandoned house, which was found by looters after one lit a cigarette that created enough light to expose the body. She was initially believed to possibly be a prostitute until police had moved her body and discovered she did not have developed breasts, indicating she had not gone through puberty. Further examination was conducted within the next week.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Corbin|first1=Christina|title=Who was she?

==Examination==
I was concluded that the victim was not killed at the location where it was discovered, as no traces of blood were found by the body.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Garrison|first1=Chad|title=The Case That Haunts|url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2004-12-01/news/the-case-that-haunts/full/|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Riverfront Times|publisher=Riverfront Times, LLC|date=1 December 2004}}</ref> The girl was also bound at the wrists with a red nylon cord and lying face down. Her head had been severed cleanly by a large blade, possibly a carving knife. She was between eight and eleven and was prepubescent, but had been raped.<ref>{{cite web|title=Case File 54UFMO|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/54ufmo.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> She wore only a V neck yellow, long sleeved, sweater and two layers of pink and purple nail polish.<ref>{{cite news|title=Victim of Beheading was Sexually Assaulted|url=https://identifyus.org/en/medias/full/9141|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Globe-Democrat|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]}}</ref> Her head has never been found, but the fingerprints, footprints and DNA information have been collected. Because there were no distinct marks or deformities on her body, except for [[spina bifida occulta]], it is unlikely that she would be identified. Four missing girls have been ruled out as the victim, as well as the [[Northampton County Jane Doe]] from North Carolina, who was ruled out to be the remaining parts of the body.<ref>{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 3199 |url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/3199|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> She was approximately 4'10" to 5'6" tall when she was alive, which is considered tall for that age. After ten months her burial took place in December 1983.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grollmus|first1=Denise|title=In 1983, a Young Girl Was Assaulted and Decapitated.

==Investigation==
Authorities decided to exhume the body in 2013 in order to gather more forensic information about the victim. The remains had been misplaced, along with many other bodies in the Washington Park Cemetery, due to the negligence of cemetery records and were not found until mid June, with the help of an expensive GPS-like device.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Byers|first1=Christine|title=New hope in cold case of decapitated girl found in St. Louis, but now where's the body?|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/new-hope-in-cold-case-of-decapitated-girl-found-in/article_ef7aca67-2f9f-5c76-9516-4285802f338f.html|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Post-Dispatch|date=17 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Regnier, Chris and Washington, Shirley|title=Body Of Decapitated Girl In 30-Year-Old Case Exhumed|url=http://fox2now.com/2013/06/17/body-of-decapitated-girl-in-30-year-old-case-to-be-exhumed/|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Fox2Now|publisher=Fox|date=17 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Levin|first1=Sam|title=St. Louis Cops, Researchers Find Remains Of Slain "Jane Doe," Girl Decapitated 30 Years Ago|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/dailyrft/2013/06/st_louis_jane_doe_decapitated.php|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=Riverfront News|publisher=Riverfront Times, LLC|date=18 June 2013}}</ref> After tests on samples of her bones were concluded at the [[University of North Texas]], the victim is believed to have originally lived in the southeastern part of the country.<ref name=unsolved>{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Bill|title=30 years later, unsolved case of young 'Jane Doe' still haunts police|url=https://www.stlbeacon.org/#!/content/29664/unsolved_murder_jane_doe|accessdate=28 November 2014|work=The Beacon|date=4 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1983|url=http://www.missingkids.com/poster/NCMU/1104360/1#poster|website=missingkids.com|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref> 
Her sweater had previously been sent to a psychic in Florida but was never returned, presumably lost in the mail. She was also presumed to have been a victim of [[Vernon Brown]], who had murdered young girls in a similar manner. Brown was executed in 2005 and never confessed to murdering the Jane Doe despite efforts made by investigators.<ref name=unsolved/>
