The '''Alton Railroad''' was the final name of a [[railroad]] linking [[Chicago]] to [[Alton, Illinois]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Its predecessor, The Chicago & Alton Railroad, was purchased by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio]] in 1931 and was controlled until 1942 when the Alton was released to the courts. On [[May 31]] [[1947]], the Alton Railroad was merged into the [[Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad]].

The line to Alton and St. Louis is now mostly part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] system; the line to Kansas City is part of the [[Kansas City Southern Railway]] system. [[Metra]]'s [[Heritage Corridor]] provides [[commuter rail]] service on the old main line, now owned by the [[Canadian National Railway]] through its [[Illinois Central Railroad]], between Chicago and [[Joliet, Illinois]].

== History ==
The earliest ancestor to the Alton Railroad is the Alton and Sangamon Railroad, chartered [[February 27]], [[1847]], in [[Illinois]] to connect the [[Mississippi River]] town of [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]] to the state capital at [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] in [[Sangamon County, Illinois|Sangamon County]]. The line was finished in 1852, and as the Chicago & Mississippi Railroad extended to [[Bloomington, Illinois|Bloomington]] in 1854 and [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]] in 1855. Initially, trains ran over the completed [[Chicago and Rock Island Railroad]] to Chicago. 

The Joliet and Chicago Railroad was chartered [[February 15]], [[1855]], and opened in 1856, continuing north and northeast from Joliet to downtown Chicago. It was leased by the Chicago & Mississippi provinding a continuous railroad from Alton to Chicago. In 1857 the C&M was reorganized as the St. Louis, Alton and Chicago Railroad, and another reorganization on [[October 10]], [[1862]], produced the Chicago and Alton Railroad. The C&A chartered the Alton and St. Louis Railroad to extend the line to [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]], opened in 1864 giving it a line from Chicago to East St. Louis.

==Passenger service notables==
The first [[sleeping car]] designed by [[George Pullman]] was built in the C&A's Bloomington shops and introduced [[September 1]], [[1859]], over the Chicago-East St. Louis mainline. Sleeping cars were operated over most routes between Chicago, Peoria, Bloomington, St. Louis and Kansas City in principal train consists. Successor Gulf, Mobile & Ohio operated Chicago-St. Louis sleeping car service until [[December 31]], [[1959]], the last railroad to do so between the two cities.

The first [[dining car]], the ''Delmonico'', named for the famous [[New York City|New York]] restaurant, built by Pullman in the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Chicago, Burlington & Qunicy]] [[Aurora, Illinois]], shops, first appeared in regular service over the C&A's Chicago-East St. Louis mainline. Two other Pullman diners built at the same time, the ''Tremont'', and the ''Southern'', were leased, providing dining car service on all three principal C&A Chicago-East St. Louis trains. Dining cars were a part of Chicago-St.louis train consists until [[May 1]], [[1971]], with the takeover of passenger service by [[Amtrak]].

===Stations in Chicago===
First entry of C&A passenger trains from Joliet into Chicago was over the Chicago & Rock Island to that railroad's depot (later [[La Salle Street Station]]). Briefly, passenger trains were moved over to the Illinois Central depot. On [[December 28]], [[1863]], the leased J&C and [[Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway]] came to an agreement where the J&C would use the PFW&C's terminal at [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]], later becoming a tenant of Union Station, which opened in 1881. In 1924, with the completion of a new [[Union Station (Chicago)|Union Station]] between Adams and Jackson streets, C&A became a tenant and its successors used Union Station up to the takeover by Amtrak.
