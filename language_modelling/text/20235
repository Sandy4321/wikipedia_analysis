The '''International Bar Association''' ('''IBA''') is an international association of [[lawyer]]s and lawyers' associations. The IBA's stated purpose is to promote an exchange of information between legal associations worldwide, support the independence of the [[judiciary]] and the right of lawyers to practice their profession without interference, and support [[human rights]] for lawyers worldwide through its Human Rights Institute.<ref name="IBA_hrights">[http://www.ibanet.org/humanrights/headerpage.cfm IBA Human Rights Institute].</ref> The organization acts through sections and committees to enable an interchange of information and views among its members as to laws, practices and professional responsibilities relating to the practice of [[commercial law]] throughout the world. In doing so, the IBA seeks to "influence the development of international law reform" and "shape the future of the legal profession" globally.<ref name=About>[http://www.ibanet.org/About_the_IBA/About_the_IBA.aspx About the IBA].</ref>

==About the IBA==
The International Bar Association (IBA), established in 1947, is an organisation of international legal practitioners, [[bar associations]] and [[law societies]]. The IBA works to influence the development of [[international law]] reform and to shape the future of the legal profession throughout the world. It has a membership of more than 40,000 individual lawyers and 197 bar associations and law societies spanning all continents. It has considerable expertise in providing assistance to the global legal community.<ref name=IBA_hrights />

=== Structure of the IBA ===
The IBA is grouped into two divisions <U+2013> the Legal Practice Division and the Public and Professional Interest Division <U+2013> which together cover all practice areas and professional interests, providing members with access to leading experts and up-to-date information. Through the various committees of the divisions, the IBA enables an interchange of information and views among its members as to laws, practices and professional responsibilities relating to the practice of business law around the globe.<ref name=IBA_hrights />

=== History of the IBA ===
With the aim of supporting the establishment of law and administration of [[justice]] worldwide, representatives of 34 national bar associations gathered in New York on 17 February 1947 to create the IBA. IBA membership grew steadily and in 1970 was accelerated by the admission of individual lawyers to the Association and the formation of the Section on Business Law. In 1974 the Section on Legal Practice was formed and in 1982 a third section, the Section on Energy and Natural Resources Law, was created. The Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Just Rule of Law was formed in the 1980s. In 1992 an Action Plan was adopted to establish a Trial Observer Corps and investigate cases where judges and lawyers or the independence of bar associations was threatened. In 1995, the formation of the Human Rights Institute expanded this work and gave the opportunity for member organisations and individual members to contribute actively.<ref name=IBA_hrights />

==Committees and Fora==
Individual members of the IBA join committees depending on their practice areas and interests, and benefit from being able to communicate with colleagues across the world that practice in the same field. The committees publish regular news and articles for their members in hardcopy newsletters and/or e-bulletins. These groups also organise specialist conferences throughout the year, where members can meet to discuss the latest issues within their field.<ref name="IBA_Committees">[http://www.ibanet.org/Committees/Committee_Index.aspx IBA Committees].</ref>

=== Legal Practice Division ===
The stated objectives of the Legal Practice Division are to promote an interchange of information and views among its members as to laws, practices and professional responsibilities relating to the practice of law throughout the world; to facilitate communication among its members; to provide the opportunity to all its members to be active in the division through its sections, committees, fora and other groupings; and to undertake such related projects as may be approved from time to time by the division<U+2019>s council.<ref name="IBA_LPD">[http://www.ibanet.org/Committees/Divisions/Legal_Practice/home.aspx IBA Legal Practices Division].</ref>
The International Bar Association provides for situations where there may be a conflict of interest. In particular, the Association has formulated guidelines, known as the IBA Guidelines, which categorize instances where a conflict of interest may be present. There are five lists: the red list, waivable red list, orange list, turquoise list and the green list which list a number of circumstances where a conflict of interest may be of issue and provide guidance as to whether there should be disclosure. These guidelines have been recognized at an international level and it is hoped that they will continue to be of influence in both domestic and international settings.

=== Public and Professional Interest Division ===
The PPID constitutes a wide array of projects, activities, committees and other entities focusing on issues and professional interests that make the practice of law a profession and not only an occupation. The stated objectives of the Division are to promote an interchange of information and views among Member Organisations of the Association and its individual members about the [[public interest|public]] and professional interest activities of the legal profession throughout the world; to support and promote those activities, the [[Rule of Law]] and the defence of human rights; to facilitate communication among Member Organisations and its members; to provide the opportunity to Member Organisations and all members to be active in the Division through its Bar Issues Commission ('BIC'), committees, fora and other groupings; and to undertake such related projects as may be approved from time to time by the Division<U+2019>s Council.<ref name="IBA_PPID">[http://www.ibanet.org/Committees/Divisions/Public_Professional_Interest_Div/home.aspx IBA Professional and Private Interest Division].</ref>

=== Bar Issues Commission ===
The Bar Issues Commission was established in 2004 to address the interest of the IBA<U+2019>s Member Organisations. The BIC has five officers who are elected by the IBA Council and it is responsible for instigating discussion amongst bar associations and law societies worldwide. Through its Policy Committee, the BIC proposes resolutions and guidelines for approval by the IBA Council that are of relevance to member organisations. The Committee is made up of representatives from bar association societies around the world and looks at key issues facing the profession such as continuing [[professional development]], [[regulation]], and the core values of the legal profession.<ref name="IBA_Bar_Issues">[http://www.ibanet.org/barassociations/bar_issues_commission.aspx IBA Bar Issues Commission].</ref>

==Task Forces and Action Groups==
=== Rule of Law Action Group ===
The Rule of Law Action Group (RoLAG) was formed in early 2007. RoLAG's purpose is to encourage and assist the membership of the IBA, both member organisations and individual members, to respond on a continuous basis to the call of the IBA Council, at the end of its [[resolution (law)|resolution]] passed in [[Prague]] in September 2005, 'to speak out in support of the Rule of Law within their respective communities'.<ref name="IBA_RoLAG"
>[http://www.ibanet.org/PPID/Constituent/Rule_of_Law_Action_Group/Default.aspx IBA Rule of Law Action Group].</ref>

=== Task Force on the Financial Crisis ===
The task force is meant to develop proposals for changes to the regulatory architecture and rules system, looking at both international aspects (it being widely acknowledged that a [[global market]] needs some form of global regulation) and issues applicable to the major financial jurisdictions; review and comment on ideas and proposals developed by other contributors to the discussion; advocate the continuance of [[economic liberalism|liberal]] world [[financial markets]] and take a firm stand against [[protectionism]] by regulation; defend the rule of law as the fundamental principle and prerequisite of [[free trade]]; communicate through statements, reports and conferences; and as appropriate, meet in the major jurisdictions of the world with politicians, regulators, market participants and other interested parties to consult and discuss its ideas and proposals.<ref name="IBA_Task_Financial">[http://www.ibanet.org/LPD/Task_Force_on_the_Financial_Crisis.aspx IBA Task Force on the Financial Crisis].</ref>

=== Task Force on International Terrorism ===
In 2003, the IBA formed a Terrorism Task Force to analyse the challenges posed by [[international terrorism]].  The Task Force draws on the expertise of its high-profile members, the input from specialised IBA Human Rights Institute working groups and information gained during meetings with high-level officials around the world. The Task Force provides conclusions and recommendations for policy makers and practitioners working in the field of [[counter-terrorism]].<ref name="IBA_Task_Terrorism">[http://www.ibanet.org/Human_Rights_Institute/About_the_HRI/HRI_Activities/International_terrorism.aspx IBA Task Force on International Terrorism].</ref>

==Conferences==
The IBA stages around 40 conferences each year in major cities throughout the world. Conferences are open to both IBA members and non-members, with discounted rates offered for early registration and IBA members. Attendance at IBA conferences provides a way to meet Continuing Professional Development requirements. All IBA Conferences carry CPD/CLE accreditation.<ref name="IBA_Conferences">[http://www.ibanet.org/Conferences/conferences_home.aspx IBA Conferences].</ref>

The IBAHRI operates under the belief in the fundamental right of the world<U+2019>s citizens to have disputes heard and determined by an independent judiciary, and for judges and lawyers to be able to practise freely and without interference.

=== History ===
Established in 1995 under the honorary presidency of Nelson Mandela, the IBA's Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) works to promote the rule of law worldwide. The IBAHRI works to promote, protect and enforce human rights under a just rule of law in a variety of ways. These ways include: training lawyers, [[judge]]s and [[prosecutors]] in human rights law and [[international humanitarian law]]; pioneering training programmes to strengthen the judiciary in post-conflict countries or countries where basic state infrastructure may have been eroded; undertaking fact-finding missions and sending trial observers to countries where the rule of law has deteriorated; making representations to authorities worldwide where individuals or the independence of the judiciary has been threatened; galvanising international support to lobby for change through media and advocacy campaigns; and providing long-term technical assistance to under-resourced bar associations and law societies. The Institute works closely with international and regional human rights organisations and produces newsletters and other publications to highlight issues of concern to worldwide media<ref name="About_hri"/>

==IBA ICC Program==
The IBA Programme on the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) monitors fair trial and defence related issues at the ICC and encourages the legal community to engage with the work of the Court. The IBA<U+2019>s monitoring work includes thematic legal analysis of the ICC<U+2019>s [[pre-trial]] and [[trial]] proceedings, and ad hoc evaluations of legal, administrative and institutional issues which could potentially affect the rights of [[defendants]], the impartiality of proceedings and the development of international justice. The Programme also acts as the interface between the Court and the global legal community. As such, special focus is placed on monitoring emerging issues at the Court of particular relevance to lawyers and collaborating with key partners on specific activities, such as the IBA/ICC List Counsel Campaign, to increase engagement of the legal community on ICC issues.<ref name="IBA_ICC">[http://www.ibanet.org/Human_Rights_Institute/ICC_Outreach_Monitoring/IBA_ICC_Programme_About_us_.aspx IBA ICC Programme].</ref>
