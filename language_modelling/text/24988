In the [[I Book of Chronicles]] '''Jabez''' is a well-respected man (ancestor in the lineage of the kings tribe of [[Tribe of Judah|Judah]] whose prayer to God for blessing was answered, see [[1 Chronicles]] 4:9-10. Moreover the author paused in this long list to give Jabez a place of honour in the long list of Kings and lineage.

This short passage of scripture came to the attention of millions of [[Christianity|Christians]] following the publication of the book [[The Prayer of Jabez]] by [[Bruce Wilkinson]], in which he encouraged Christians to pray the way Jabez did.

The name ''Jabez'' sounds like the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for ''pain'', and was given to him because of the pain his mother suffered while bearing him; whether the pain was a result of the birth or coincided with the birth is unclear. It is speculated that, because Jabez was named by his mother, that there was no father in his life. Therefore, such birth out of wedlock would have been the source of pain and shame in Hebrew culture of the time. Hence the name. Whatever the interpretation, the prayer of Jabez has served both as a puzzle and also as an inspiration and model for some Christians. Jabez quite probably overcame adverse circumstances of birth to achieve a place of honor in his ancient society.

'''Jabez''' is also mentioned in 1 Chronicles. 2:55, possibly as a place name.
