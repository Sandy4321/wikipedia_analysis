{{Assyrian culture}}
'''[[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[cuisine]]''' is similar to other [[Middle East]]ern cuisines. It is rich in grains, meat, tomato, and potato. Rice is usually served with every meal accompanied by a stew which is typically poured over the rice. Tea is typically consumed at all times of the day with or without meals alone or as a social drink. Cheese, crackers, biscuits, baklawa, or other snacks are often served alongside the tea as appetizers. Dietary restrictions may apply during special holidays in which certain types of foods may not be consumed; often meaning animal-derived. Howerver, unlike their Muslim or Jewish neighbors of the countries they originated from, they may consume pork or alcohol though pork is not a staple in the diet and is shunned by many. There are hold-overs from the [[Old Testament]] in which people slaughter animals a certain way and where some animals are considered unclean such as the aforementioned [[swine]]. The story of [[Jesus]] casting the demonic [[Legion (demon)|Legions]] into pigs that went over the cliff is a popular reason for some Assyrians not to eat pork. Alcohol on the other hand is rather popular specifically in the form of [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]].

There is a widely circulated story on the Web stating that the Assyrians invented [[baklava]] in the [[8th century BCE]],<ref>[http://www.kitchenproject.com/history/Baklava.htm History of Baklava], [http://www.turkishculture.org/pages.php?ChildID=310&ParentID=11&ID=50&ChildID1=310 Turkish Culture: Baklava], [http://yalibnan.com/site/archives/2006/05/baklava_war_int.php Baklava War Intensifies], [http://www.natashascafe.com/html/baklava.html Baklava]</ref> but current scholarly work indicates that it is of central Asian Turkic origin.<ref>Perry, Charles.

== ''Ftarta'' or ''Thomta'' (<U+0726><U+071B><U+072A><U+072C><U+0710> or <U+071B><U+0721><U+072C><U+0710>; breakfast) ==
Common breakfast usually contains [[eggs (food)|eggs]] (scrambled, sunny side up, hard boiled); usually with [[frying|fried]] [[tomatoes]], [[tahini|tahina]] (sesame seed paste) with either [[ficus|fig]] jam or [[Date Palm|date]] syrup, [[pastirma|bastirma]] (dried sausage), geimar ([[kaymak]]), [[halva|halawa]], etc. [[Hareesa]] is also eaten as a breakfast by some because it is perceived as a heavy and nutritious meal. Eggs are usually scrambled and contain parsley cooked in it with lots of black pepper and salt. Often the ''bastirma'' is cooked in with the eggs as may other ingredients be added in as well. Tomatoes are also diced and fried with the eggs, oftentimes scrambling a few eggs with the tomatoes and then adding more eggs, leaving those sunny side up. Yogurt; called ''masta'' in Syriac, is also served with breakfast and bread, specifically in a pita or in a loaf, is usually used to dip into the pita, though masta may also served alongside other non-breakfast dishes. Tea is usually drunk in the morning along with the breakfast. ''Halawa'' is often wrapped in pita bread and dipped in ''tahina'' for a nutritious breakfast snack or like how eggs are consumed it may be eaten in bite-size scoops of pita. Pita bread or home-made bread is usually eaten.

==''Maza'' (<U+0721><U+0719><U+0710>; appetizer) ==
Assyrian ''Maza'' is similar to related cuisines' Mezze which may include [[hummus|Humous ou Tahina]], [[baba ghanoush|Baba Ghanouj]], [[Tabooli|Tapoula]], [[Fattoush]], vegetables and dip, [[Burek]], etc. [[Fava beans]], known as ''baqilleh'', and [[chick peas]], known as ''[[lablabi]]'' or ''khirtamaneh'' (Syriac: <U+071A><U+072A><U+071B><U+0721><U+0722><U+0710>), are very common in soups, salads, and find their way into many foods. Fried almonds and raisins are also used but not as appetizers but rather as garnishes for main dishes. Another popular ''maza'' is ''tourshi'' which means pickles. Many different types of vegetables are pickled such as cucumbers, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, beats, and peppers. As mentioned in the main paragraph, tea is a staple in the diet even more so than coffee. Almost always the ''maza'' is accompanied with tea or Turkish coffee.

==''Khadaya w Ashaya'', or ''Hsimtho'' (<U+071A><U+0715><U+071D><U+0710> <U+0718> <U+0725><U+072B><U+071D><U+0710>; lunch and dinner)==
''Khadaya w Ashaya'', or ''Hsimtho'' in Syriac (<U+071A><U+0715><U+071D><U+0710> <U+0718> <U+0725><U+072B><U+071D><U+0710>; [[lunch]] and [[dinner]]) is also referred to as ''Kawithra w Kharamsha''. Lunch typically consists of [[basmati]] [[rice]] which is prepared with fried miniature [[noodles]] called ''sha'riya'' or in place of rice [[bulgur|burghul]] may be used which may also be prepared with the same type of noodles. It is usually accompanied with a [[stew]]; called ''shorba'' or ''maraqa'', [[salad]]; called ''zalata'', or [[yogurt]]; called ''masta''. There are many variations in the salads and yogurt sauces. ''Khalwa'' is a common yogurt sauce and is similar to [[tzatziki]]. It contains yogurt, cucumbers, garlic, herbs, and spices. Also there is ''daweh'' which is a drink consisting of yogurt, water, and salt. It is known as ''shaneenah'' in Arabic or [[doogh]] in Persian. Lebanese varieties usually contain mint. ''Daweh'', which consists of ''masta'', water, and salt, is most commonly served as a complimentary drink with many meals.

The most common stews are [[potato]] which is referred to by the name of the main spice [[Curry]]; called ''kari'', [[common bean]]; called ''[[Fasolada|fasulya]]'', [[green beans]]; called ''chipti'', fried [[okra]]; called ''bumya'', and a crushed [[lentil]] soup; called ''[[Lentil soup|tlokheh]]''. There is also a rice and [[cabbage]] meal called ''tirkhena'' in which the rice and cabbage are cooked together with bits of steak meat.

Most stews consist of [[tomato paste]], [[water]], small pieces of [[steak]] or [[chicken]], [[spices]], and [[vegetables]] such as [[spinach]] for example which is called ''spenakh''. The stews and dishes in general are usually referred to by the main ingredient in the dish.

During the Holidays there are special dishes. There are [[biryani]], [[dokhwa]], [[pacha]], [[kibbeh|kubba]], ''[[maqluba]]'', [[dolma]], [[quzi]] and many other dishes. There is a special type of ''kubba'' called ''kiddeldokeh'' which is prepared in yogurt. It along with ''kubba hamouth'', ''kubba d-khoumsa,'' and ''kubba d-sawma'' are specific to the Assyrian community and very rare in other communities. There are many varieties of ''Kubba'', ''Dolma'', and ''Biryani'' specific to the cook that prepares them. [[Kufta]] is a meal prepared similarly to ''kubba hamouth'' meaning that it is cooked in a semi-sour tomato sauce, though it is more similar to a meatball than a ''kubba''; which consists of lean meat and ground rice or burghul on the outside, and meat and onions on the inside. Many foods maybe prepared for ''[[sawm]]a'' which means Lenten. During important holidays such as ''Ba'ootha'' no meat or dairy may be consumed. A fairly popular Lenten meal is ''Girtho'' which is rice cooked in yogurt. It is eaten with date syrup poured on top. However, it may not be consumed during ''Ba'ootha'' due to the restriction on all animal sources of food.

Because Assyrians are minorities in all places they inhabit, their local cuisine may vary and also contain elements of the popular cuisine in their locale. The majority of [[Iraqi cuisine]] is incorporated into Iraqi Assyrian cuisine and the same is the case for Assyrians of Iran, Syria, or Turkey. [[Falafel]] with [[Amba (condiment)|amba]] for example is very popular amongst Assyrians and are especially common during lent and other holidays requiring dietary restrictions that call for abstinence from animal-derived products and foods.

==Desserts, Snacks, and Beverages==

There are several different types of dessert which include Baklava, ''[[Kleicha|Kuleicheh]]'', different types of cakes and cookies, ''[[Kadaif|Kadeh]]'', and others. ''Kadeh'' (<U+071F><U+0715><U+0710>) are usually prepared alongside ''Kulecheh'' and also ''Takhiryatha'' which are not dessert and often referred to as "[[Sfiha|Chaldean Pizza]]" because they resemble pizza; containing meat and tomatoes on top of bread but lacking cheese unlike pizza. A ''Kada'' looks like a thick yellowish flat bread though it contains plenty of butter, eggs, and sugar which renders it a very sweet pastry. Due to the influence from the post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation of Iraq and Syria by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] many customs were picked up from the colonial administrators. Tea and Biscuits are often eaten as snacks or even as a breakfast. [[Turkish coffee]] which is a hold-over from Ottoman times is often used the same way though with a twist of fortune telling called ''finjan'' which is a form of [[tasseography]]. When the coffee is consumed the fortune teller will look at the bottom of the cup and read you your future. Arak is one of the most popular alcoholic beverages. It tastes like black liquorice and is clear until mixed with water, which then becomes milky-white.
