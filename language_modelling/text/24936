The bidders that fell in the top 96 were given the opportunity to be the first public riders on Leviathan on 27 April 2012, one week before the park officially opened.

==Ride experience==
[[File:Leviathan CW Track Layout.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The track layout for the roller coaster.]]
''Leviathan'' is Bolliger & Mabillard's tallest roller coaster to date. One cycle of the ride lasts about 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<ref name="B&M height">{{RCDB|coaster_name=Roller Coaster Search Results|location=Bolliger & Mabillard Coasters by Height|accessdate=18 August 2011|url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?nm=na&co=6831&order=-23&ot=2}}</ref><ref name="Official Stats"/>

[[File:Leviathan Hammerhead Turn.jpg|thumb|250px|The hammerhead turn of ''Leviathan''.]]
After departing from the station, the train makes a 180 degree turn to the right, then begins to climb the [[chain lift hill]]. Once the train reaches the top of the {{Convert|306|ft|adj=on}} lift, it drops back down to the ground on a 80 degree angle reaching speeds of up to {{Convert|92|mph}}.<ref name="Official Stats" /><ref name="Official layout" /> Following the first drop, the track goes through a {{Convert|100|ft|adj=on}} long tunnel and then curves upwards into a {{Convert|164|ft|adj=on}}-tall overbanked banked turn to the right before dropping again and racing through a sweeping high<U+2013>speed turn to the left at approximately {{Convert|76|mph}}.<ref name="Official Stats"/><ref name="Official layout"/><ref name=CWtunnel /> The exit of the first high speed turn leads directly into a {{Convert|183|ft|adj=on}}-tall camelback, followed by a {{Convert|147|ft|adj=on}}-tall, 115 degree [[Roller coaster elements#Hammerhead turn|hammerhead turn]].<ref name="CityNews announce" /> Both of these elements are located above the guest parking lot and in front of [[International Street (Canada's Wonderland)#Front gate|the main entrance of the park]].<ref name="Official Stats"/><ref name="Official layout"/> After exiting the hammerhead turn, the train enters a second high-speed curve, this time at a speed of approximately {{Convert|60|mph}}. The train then traverses a smaller, {{Convert|124|ft|adj=on}}-tall camelback leading towards the final element of the ride, a third high<U+2013>speed turn.<ref name="Official Stats"/><ref name="Official layout"/> The turn bends to the left and leads directly into the [[brake run]] and finally back into the [[Station (roller coaster)|station]].<ref name="Official Stats">{{cite web|title=Leviathan Statistics|url=http://leviathan.canadaswonderland.com/public/ride/statistics.cfm|publisher=Canada's Wonderland|accessdate=18 August 2011|date=18 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="Official layout">{{cite web|title=Track Layout :: Leviathan|url=http://leviathan.canadaswonderland.com/public/ride/|publisher=Canada's Wonderland|accessdate=18 August 2011|date=18 August 2011}}</ref>
