On 14 December, 2013, a largely ethnic faction of the [[Armed Forces of South Sudan]] caused a political crisis in [[South Sudan]]. [[President of South Sudan|President]] [[Salva Kiir]] announced that the attempt was put down the next day, but fighting resumed on 16 December and spread beyond the capital, [[Juba]], to the ethnic tinderbox<!--background mentions fighting there is regular--> of [[Jonglei]] largely along ethnic lines. At least 500 were reported to have died and over 400 injured. Kiir blamed former vice president [[Riek Machar]] for instigating the "coup" but Machar denied any knowledge of it and instead blamed Kiir for playing [[power politics]].

==Background==
Following the [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|independence of South Sudan]], Culture Minister [[Jok Madut Jok]] then said of the country's challenges:<ref name="aljazanalysis">{{cite news|title=Analysis: Struggle for power in South Sudan|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/analysis-struggle-power-south-sudan-20131217845861691.html|author=Musaazi Namiti|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><blockquote>The first leg for any government is a disciplined military. We have problems with the way our [[Armed Forces of South Sudan|military functions]] today. That's a broken leg. We have civil society, right now it is very weak. The third leg is delivery of services. It is hard to deliver security...The fourth leg is political unity. We had political unity in the days leading up to the referendum [which led to independence]. Since the referendum, we have been having difficulties uniting our ranks. So right now the animal is standing on four crooked legs. If we do not fix these legs, the future is going to be very, very difficult.</blockquote>

The [[constitution of South Sudan]] also has broad powers reserved for the president, including sacking governors and appointing MPs. In February, President [[Salva Kiir]] ordered more than 100 army generals to retire so as to reorganise the military, but this was viewed as troublesome by others.<ref name="aljazanalysis"/> Kiir had also suggested that his rivals were trying to revive the rifts that had provoked infighting in the 1990s.<ref name="aljaz18dec"/>

In summer 2011, [[Riek Machar]] was vice president of the only party and made the vice president of the country. In July 2013, he, along with the entire cabinet, was dismissed from office by Kiir. However, he said that Kiir's move was a step towards dictatorship and that he would challenge Kiir for the presidency.<ref name="prez">{{cite news|title=South Sudan gripped by power struggle|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/07/20137287019670555.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=28 July 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> He added that if the country is to be united it cannot tolerate "one man's rule."<ref name="aljaz1"/> Kiir also dissolved some key party institutions,{{which|date=December 2013}} suspended the SPLM Secretary-General Pagan Amum and issued a decree preventing him from leaving Juba or speaking to the media.<ref name="aljazanalys"/>

At the same time, the U.S. and the E.U. feared political upheaval.<ref name="aljaz2"/> The dissident group was said to include [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] (SPLM) founder [[John Garang]]'s widow [[Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior|Rebecca Garang]].<ref name="smh"/>

Further, Machar and Kiir, while being members of the SPLM, are members of different tribes. Kiir is an ethnic [[Dinka]], while Machar is an ethnic [[Nuer people|Nuer]].<ref name="aljaz1"/> Similarly, since independence, [[South Sudan internal conflict (2011<U+2013>present)|tribal factionalism has routinely occurred]], especially in [[Jonglei]].<ref name="aljaz2"/>

==Coup d'etat attempt==
The South Sudanese ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'' reported clashes breaking out late on 14 December between members of the presidential guard.<ref name="aljaz1"/> Kiir also claimed that the fighting began when unidentified uniformed personnel started shooting at a meeting of the SPLM.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="aljazanalysis"/> The military headquarters near [[Juba University]] were attacked with fighting continuing throughout the night.<ref name="aljaz2"/> The next day heavy gunfire occurred in South Sudan's capital, [[Juba]], as the rival factions clashed<ref name="aljaz1"/> and heavily-armed soldiers were reportedly on the streets. The [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan]] also reported the sound of mortar and heavy machine-gun fire, while it claimed hundreds of civilians sought refuge inside its facilities<ref name="aljaz2"/> Military spokesman Colonel Philip Aguer said that some military installations had been attacked by armed soldiers but that "the army is in full control of Juba." He added that an investigation was under way and that though the situation was tense it was also unlikely to deteriorate.<ref name="aljaz1">{{cite news|title=Heavy gunfire rocks South Sudan capital|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/heavy-gunfire-heard-south-sudan-capital-201312167240288669.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> Several people were also injured during the fighting.<ref name="bbc"/> [[Juba International Airport]] was closed indefinitely, according to unnamed civil aviation and airline sources;<ref name="smh">{{cite news|title=Attempted coup in South Sudan|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/attempted-coup-in-south-sudan-20131216-hv5z9.html#ixzz2nfEsbGNO|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> The curfew would be every night from 18:00 to 6:00.<ref name="bbc"/> Kenyan airlines [[Fly540]] and [[Kenya Airways]] indefinitely suspended flights to Juba after the airport closed.<ref name="reut"/> State-owned ''[[SSTV]]'' went off-air for several hours.

Foreign Minister [[Barnaba Marial Benjamin]] said that soldiers at the army base attempted to raid a weapons store but were repulsed. He added that unnamed politicians had also been arrested, but could not confirm if Machar was one of them. He also said that those that were a part of the coup were "disgruntled" soldiers and politicians led by Machar.<ref name="aljaz2"/> At least ten people were confirmed to have been detained, including former Finance Minister [[Kosti Manibe]]. Five others were sought for questioning, including Machar and [[Pagan Amum]]. Information Minister [[Micheal Makuei]] claimed that Machar had left Juba with some soldiers and stolen cattle.<ref name="bbcday2" /> Of those arrested, seven were confirmed as former ministers. Other arrests included those of Kiir's critics.<ref name="aljazanalys"/> Amum said on 15 December that 
"I am fine, that's all I can say," while Machar's spokesman, James Gatdet Dak, said Machar "has not been arrested. He's in Juba. He's fine, very fine."<ref name="aljazanalys"/>

===Renewed fighting===
Despite claims of having quashed the coup, fighting renewed on 17 December with the ''Sudan Tribune'' reporting it had spread to [[Bor County|Bor]], in Jonglei where three people had died;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article49215|title=Three killed in Bor as Juba fighting spreads|work=[[Sudan Tribune]]|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> this was confirmed by the UN who reported that over 1,000 people sought refuge in its compound there.<ref name="aljaz18dec"/> Fighting started again at 9:00 from a military headquarters<ref name="aljaz3"/> and another miltiary barrack, according to Hussein Maar, deputy governor of Jonglei.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/1218/493552-south-sudan/ |title=South Sudan army loses control of flashpoint town - RT<U+00C9> News |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref> Fighting also occurred near the presidential palace and other areas of Juba. Ajak Bullen, a doctor at a military hospital, said that "so far, we have lost seven soldiers who died while they were waiting for medical attention and a further 59 who were killed outside.

The [[International Crisis Group]] (ICG) reported that fighting occurred between Dinka and the Nuer in [[Pibor]] in Jonglei amid reports of ethnically targeted killings. It also said that Machar's house had been bombarded and "surrounded, including with tanks", while "parts of Juba have been reduced to rubble" and that fighting between Nuer and Dinka had taken place at military barracks in Jonglei.<ref name="aljazanalys"/> Communication links were either down or poor.<ref name="aljaz500">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/south-sudan-death-toll-rises-sharply-2013121723050981592.html |title=South Sudan death toll rises sharply - Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>

Fighting between military factions spread beyond Juba to Jonglei, amid fears of a wider conflict. Military spokesman Colonel Philip Aguer said that there was overnight fighting among troops in Jonglei on 17-18 December and that he was verifying reports of desertions from the military. It followed reports from the ICG that Nuer in the area were defecting from the armed forces and that Dinka people feared re-enactment of the 1991 massacre by the Nuers. In Juba, a semblance of calm had returned by 18 December with a trickle of traffic.<ref name="aljaz18dec">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/12/south-sudan-violence-spreads-from-capital-20131218123217186850.html |title=South Sudan violence spreads from capital - Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>

The UN reported that 13,000 people were taking refuge from the fighting in its two compounds in Juba.<ref name="bbcday2" /><ref name="aljazanalys"/>

==Response==
President Salva Kiir spoke on national television on 16 December, and abandoned his traditional suit and cowboy hat for military fatigues, and said, while surrounded by government officials, that the coup had been foiled that it was orchestrated by<blockquote>a group of soldiers allied with the former vice president. The attackers went and (the) armed forces are pursuing them. I promise you today that justice will prevail.</blockquote>
 
<blockquote>Your government led by the SPLM has articulated the ideals of democracy in the party as well as in the government, and I will never deviate from them at any cost. The SPLM is fully committed to the peaceful and democratic transfer of power, and will never allow political power to be transferred through violence.<ref name="aljazanalysis"/></blockquote>

He further noted that government was then "in full control of the military situation" and that he had ordered a dawn-to-dusk curfew in Juba.<ref name="aljaz2">{{cite news|title=S Sudan president says coup attempt 'foiled'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2013/12/s-sudan-president-says-coup-attempt-foiled-2013121613417331572.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> He finally said that "I will not allow or tolerate such incidents once again in our new nation. I strongly condemn these criminal actions in the strongest terms possible. [Those responsible for the incidents would have to stand] before the appropriate law institution."<ref name="bbc"/>

Machar spoke for the first time since the crisis began on 18 December in which he said he was not aware of any such attempt, but instead blamed Kiir for fabricating allegations of a coup in order to settle political scores and target political opponents. He also said the violence was started by the presidential guard, which was founded by Kiir and told to report directly to him instead of the military.<ref name="aljaz18dec"/>

;Official
United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban-ki Moon]]'s Special Representative for South Sudan [[Hilde Johnson]] issued a statement that read the UN mission in the country was "deeply concerned" about the fighting and that "as the Special Representative of the Secretary General I urge all parties in the fighting to cease hostilities immediately and exercise restraint. I have been in touch regularly with the key leaders, including at the highest levels to call for calm."<ref name="aljaz1"/> On 17 December, Moon spoke to Kiir calling for the government to provide an "offer of dialogue to its opponents and to resolve their respective differences peacefully."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/17/southsudan-unrest-idUSL6N0JW23O20131217 |title=UPDATE 3-South Sudan says arrests 10, hunts ex-VP over foiled coup |publisher=Reuters |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>

The U.S. embassy in the country reported that while it was aware of "security incidents and sporadic gunfire in multiple locations" it could not confirm "that gunfire and insecurity have fully ceased. The embassy recommends that all U.S. citizens exercise extra caution at all times. The U.S. Embassy will continue to closely monitor the security environment in South Sudan, with particular attention to Juba city and its immediate surroundings, and will advise US citizens further if the security situation changes."<ref name="aljaz1"/> The embassy's ''[[Twitter]]'' account reported that the U.S. denied rumours Machar had taken refuge at the base<ref name="reut">{{cite news|title=Gunshots ring out in South Sudan capital after "attempted coup"|author=Carl Odera|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/12/16/uk-southsudan-unrest-idUKBRE9BF03P20131216?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> and also reiterated warnings for its citizens to "remain calm."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/USMissionJuba/status/412931159572893696|publisher=U.S. Mission in Juba|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013|agency=Twitter|title=Tweet}}</ref> On 18 December, the U.S. embassy asked all its citizens to "depart immediately." The [[United Nations Security Council]] was told of as many as 500 deaths, 800 people injured and 20,000 seeking refuge at UN centres. French Ambassador and UNSC President for December [[Gerard Araud]] said: "Fighting is on ethnic lines, which could result in a very dangerous situation" and the UNMIS has the authority to use force if necessary.<ref name="aljaz500"/>

;Others
The ICG's Casie Copeland said of the ethnic fighting that "even if there is a political deal, it will be very difficult to put the genie back in the bottle" and that it was concerning that UNMISS had "not begun patrolling in Juba and has not reached areas where civilians are concentrated." Copeland added that "it appears both sides are fighting for their political survival. The impact of this fighting is going to shape the future of South Sudan. Parts of Juba have been reduced to rubble. Ethnic tensions have been brought into the open with devastating impact, and the political dispensation of South Sudan is going to be shaped by what's happened in the last few days."<ref name="aljazanalys"/> Amongst NGOs, Emma Jane Drew, the acting director of [[Oxfam]]'s South Sudan office, said that her team were unable to leave their compound in Juba because of "continued shooting."<ref name="bbcday2"/>

===Analysis===
Kiir swapping of his traditional suit and cowboy hat for military fatigues, was noted by commentators and analysts to be indicative of the gravity of the situation. Other noticeable and concerning events from the rebellion were the division within the presidential guards that had been internationally trained and noted for their unity despite ethnic diversity. This was read as showing strains after decades of conflict with "a rebel-movement turned government that is riven by infighting between former warlords vying for a piece of this oil-rich new nation." Kiir's televised statement also controversially made reference to Machar as determined to "persistently pursue his actions of the past," in reference to a 1991 split that led to a massacre between the Dinka and Nuer minority. It was also suggested that the spark behind the revolt were rumours of arrests after "a series of publci {{sic}} statements criticising Kiir's increasingly dictatorial style." South Sudanese politics has been criticised for the ethnic dominance of the Dinka tribes, being derogatively referred to as a "Dinkocracy." U.S. Ambassador to South Sudan [[Susan D. Page]] suggested that there was not as much support for Machar in an organised manner, but a general discontent over the economic and political spheres tied to crackdown on personal freedoms that resulted in a national disunity of an identity only forged by war.<ref name="aljazanalys">{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/south-sudan-teeters-brink-20131217131843385823.html|title=South Sudan teeters on the brink|author=Hannah McNeish|date=17 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref>
