==History==
The southern part of the Hellsgate Wilderness was home to the native american group know as the [[Salado]].  This civilization flourished along the banks of the [[Salt River]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the later part of the 14th century, the Salado went into decline and by 1400 the Hellgate Wilderness area was largely abandoned.  Sometime in the 16th century, the [[Apache]] began using this area for a hunting ground and continued to do so until they were driven out by ranchers and miners of European descent.<ref name="payson"></ref>

In 1927, a [[Ryan Brougham]] airplane flown by [[Martin Jensen]] and carrying MGM's [[Leo the Lion]] was forced to make an emergency landing in a box canyon in the Hellsgate Wilderness.  Both pilot and lion survived with no injuries and the canyon was named Leo Canyon after the incident. The wreckage of the plane was left in the canyon until 1991, when a historic airplane enthusiast named Scott Gifford found it and removed it from the canyon via helicopter.  He plans to restore the plane to airworthiness. <ref name="lion">{{cite web |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/flight-today/brougham.html?c=y&page=1 |title=A Brougham Fit for a King |accessdate=1/26/2012}}</ref>  

==Recreation==
The Hellgsate Wilderness contains many trails for hiking as well as camping spots. However, usage of this area is light as trailheads are difficult to reach without 4-wheel drive capability and most trails are rated as challenging.<ref name="GORP">{{cite web |url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/hellsgate-wilderness-outdoor-pp2-guide-cid401694.html |title=GORP.com Hellsgate Wilderness |accessdate=1/26/2012}}</ref>

During the summer months, the wilderness's perennial creeks attract a small number of anglers.<ref name="WildNet"></ref>
