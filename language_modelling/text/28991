Swisher was born in 1870 near [[Levels, West Virginia]]. He became a schoolteacher there at the age of 18, then graduated from [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State Normal School]] (present-day Fairmont State University) and [[West Virginia University]] and remained in Morgantown, where he established a bookstore and stationery shop. Following the success of his bookstore, Swisher organized the Main Street Building Company, the Howard L.

He was also the inaugural secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association.

In addition, he also held prominent leadership and management roles in the Valley Wood Working Company, the Monongahela Valley Posting and Distributing Plant, the Federal Savings and Trust Company, and the West Virginia Tri-Products Company. In Hampshire County, Swisher maintained fruit growing interests and served as the president of the South Branch Merchandising Company.

In 1897, Swisher co-authored ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present'' with West Virginia historian [[Hu Maxwell]]. ''History of Hampshire County'' was the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County to be compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories, ''Briar Blossoms'', in 1899, and was the editor of ''The Ghourki'', a [[Literary magazine|literary journal]] of poetry, short stories, and [[aphorism]]s.
