'''First Capital Connect''' is a train operating company in [[England]] that began its passenger operations on the [[National Rail]] network at 02:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] [[1 April]] [[2006]]. It is owned by [[First Group]] and combines the service on the cross-London [[Thameslink]] railway line with the services along the [[East Coast Main Line]] from [[King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]] to [[Peterborough]], [[Cambridge]], and [[King's Lynn]] formerly operated by [[wagn]]. This is often referred to as [[Great Northern Route|Great Northern]]. First Group plans to overhaul the trains with new liveries and on-board services as well as an [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]8&nbsp;million program of upgrades for several major stations.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://railwaypeople.com/rail-news-articles/first-capital-connect-links-london-1027.html| author=RailStaff| year=2006-04-06| title=First Capital Connect links London| accessdate=2006-04-10}}</ref>

The two routes were amalgamated in preparation for the [[Thameslink|Thameslink Programme]] (formerly Thameslink 2000), which will increase capacity on the Thameslink route and allow trains from King's Lynn, Cambridge and Peterborough to run via Thameslink. Although there is not yet any confirmed funding for this project, the franchises were joined in 2006 to ensure that management will be fully integrated by the time Thameslink 2000 is a reality.

The current Managing Director of this company is Elaine Holt.
Other directors include, Andy Cope (Engineering), Hugh Clancy (Commercial), Karen Boswell (Customer Services), Belan McWilliam (Projects), Mohammed Saeed (Human Resources) and Nigel Holness (Operations and Safety).

==News==
On [[11 June]] [[2006]], First Capital Connect caused consternation among commuters by restricting off-peak travel in the evenings for some journeys<ref name="off-peak-bbc">{{cite web

}}</ref>. Commuters who for many years have used the off-peak service suddenly found they could not get home at their usual evening time without paying an additional fare. This "congestion charge" is attracting protest, the argument being that it unfairly penalises a subset of existing customers for congestion caused by all of them. In addition, FCC will apply these restrictions to delayed trains that were scheduled during the restricted hours<ref name="off-peak-leaflet" />. This means that any delay occurring to trains in the restricted evening hours (between 1630 and 1900h) could delay the start of the off-peak time by an equivalent amount, meaning off-peak ticket holders may need to wait for up anything to 2.5 additional hours before they are allowed to travel, even though trains are running regularly through the station.
