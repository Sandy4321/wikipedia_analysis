The '''Evolution Series''' are [[GE Transportation Systems]]' new [[diesel locomotive]] models that meet the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]'s [[EPA Tier II|Tier II]] locomotive emissions standards that took effect in [[2005]].  The Evolution Series locomotives can be delivered with either AC or DC transmission, depending on the railroad's preference.  All are powered by the new '''GEVO''' 12-cylinder engine which delivers equivalent power to the old 16-cylinder engine while consuming less fuel and producing fewer emissions.

== Models ==

Currently three different Evolution Series models have been produced.

=== ES40DC ===

The '''ES40DC''' ('''E'''volution '''S'''eries '''40'''00 hp '''DC''' transmission) replaces the former [[GE Dash 9-40CW|Dash 9-40CW]] model in GE's range and, like the former model, has been delivered only to [[Norfolk Southern]].  NS appears to prefer a slightly lower-rated locomotive than other railroads. The reason for this is that [[Norfolk Southern]] orders locomotives with 4000 HP, such as the ES40DC, and the [[EMD SD70M-2]], which is also rated at 4000 HP because they use less fuel while still having the same tractive effort, and they require less maintenance.

=== ES44DC ===

The '''ES44DC''' ('''E'''volution '''S'''eries '''44'''00 hp '''DC''' transmission) replaces the former [[GE Dash 9-44CW|Dash 9-44CW]] model in GE's range.  A large order for these locomotives has been placed by the [[BNSF Railway]], which began delivery in early [[2005]]. [[CSX Transportation]] and CN have also received these locomotives, with most being delivered in early [[2006]].

=== ES44AC ===

The '''ES44AC''' ('''E'''volution '''S'''eries '''44'''00 hp '''AC''' transmission) replaces the former [[GE AC4400CW|AC4400CW]] model in GE's range.  These locomotives have been ordered by [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (who refers to these locomotives as the '''C45ACCTE''') [[BNSF]], and [[Canadian Pacific]]. Deliveries to all are ongoing [[as of 2006]]. [[Kansas City Southern]] has also placed an order for these locomotives, with deliveries beginning in early 2007.

== Identification and spotting features ==

The Evolution Series locomotives very much resemble the previous [[GE Dash 9|Dash 9]] and [[GE AC series|AC series]] safety cab models in superficial appearance.  Both AC and DC models have the large cabinet behind the crew compartment on the left-hand side which on the AC models houses the traction [[inverter]]s.  The previous Dash 9 models had a much smaller cabinet here than the AC models did.  It is thus difficult to distinguish the DC and AC versions of the Evolution Series.

Above this cabinet, at the top of the cab end of the [[long hood]], there are four ventilation openings where previous models had three.  

The lower-roofed engine compartment is shorter than on previous models, thanks to the shorter [[prime mover]].  Earlier models had substantial space between the exhaust stack and the radiator "wings", and this is lacking on the Evolution Series.

The radiator section is significantly longer than the previous models, and appears more bulky.  As on the [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]], it overhangs at the rear.  The sloped underside has two sections with different slope angles, unlike the single previous angle.  The front end on top has a raised 'hump' - this area houses the enlarged [[intercooler]] system fitted to these locomotives.

Overall length appears to be shorter, but is the same, and the trucks and fuel tanks are identical.
