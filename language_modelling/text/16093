'''Old Perth Boys<U+2019> School''', is located at 139 [[St Georges Terrace]], [[Perth, Western Australia]].  The single storey sandstone building was designed by William Sandford in 1852, and is a significant example of a colonial building constructed in Perth from the mid-nineteenth century. 

==Description==
The Old Perth Boys School is located on St Georges Terrace, Perth. It was designed in an early [[gothic revival]] style.<ref name="HCWA">{{cite web |url=http://register.heritage.wa.gov.au/PDF_Files/O%20Reg/Old%20Perth%20Boys%20Schl%20%28I%29.PDF |title=Heritage assessment - Old Perth Boys' School |publisher=[[Heritage Council of Western Australia]] |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref> It is a single storey [[sandstone]] building built with a steeply pitched roof (originally shingled) and narrow vertical windows. The building, which closely resembles a church, had a wing added to the north in 1865 and to the south in 1868. The shingle roof has been covered with corrugated iron sheeting and the bell tower and spire have been removed.

==History==
The Perth Boys' School was established in 1847, despite not having a permanent school building.  The school occupied an assortment of vacant places, including the [[Old Court House, Perth|Old Court House]].

The location selected for the permanent school building was originally the site of a water powered flour mill on the site, <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/wa/Perth/ReveleysMillSite/21390|title=Reveleys Mill Site |publisher=Aussie Heritage.com |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> operated by [[Henry Reveley|Henry Willey Reveley]], the civil engineer for the [[Swan River Colony]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lifeonperth.com/oldboysschool.htm |title=The Old Perth Boys School |publisher=Life on Perth.com |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daao.org.au/main/read/5327|title=Henry Willey Reveley |publisher=Dictionary of Australian Artists |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

Construction of the school began in February 1853 and was completed in 1854. The school was designed by William Ayshford Sanford, Colonial Secretary from 1852 -1855, <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daao.org.au/main/read/5573 |title=William Ayshford Sanford |publisher=Dictionary of Australian Artists |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>during which period he was also Chairman of the Board of Education with an interest in schools. Sanford designed both the Perth Boys<U+2019> and Fremantle Boys<U+2019> schools. Sanford was a member of the [[Cambridge Camden Society]] <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.paulrich.net/publications/edu_research_1.html|title=Perth<U+2019>s <U+2018>The Cloisters<U+2019> as an icon of Educational Elitism : Romancing the Stone |publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] |last=Rich |first=Paul |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> and was an amateur architect, with a passion for ecclesiastical architecture and as a result the school resembles a gothic revival style church. The cost of constructing the building proved greater than expected. The additional expense was attributed to the boggy ground and the need for extra foundations. The building was built as a long, narrow structure with an east-west axis. The building proved to be too small and the small windows made the interior too dark and it was reported to lack ventilation. A gallery was then constructed at the western end. The gallery is no longer extant. 

In 1865, a small southern wing was added and two years later a northern wing was constructed. For a number of years, the school had an average of 200 students, but in 1894, due to an increase in population attributable to the gold rush, the figure increased to 346. Additional facilities were constructed in a temporary timber extension at the eastern end of the school to accommodate additional students. At the same time, plans were underway for a new building in James Street which was to be completed at the end of 1896 and where the school relocated. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/wa/Perth/OldPerthBoysSchool/21185 |title=Old Perth Boys School |publisher=Aussie Heritage.com |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> 

The building was incorporated into [[Perth Technical College]] in 1900.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.centraltafe.wa.edu.au/Dynamic/DynamicPge.asp?a=10751,0,1 |title=Central TAFE - College History |publisher=[[Central TAFE]] |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref> In 1976 the [[Public Works Department, Western Australia|Public Works Department]] restored the front fence adjoining St Georges Terrace.  In 1977, the place was used as offices for the headquarters for The National Trust of Australia (WA), with the Trust undertaking conservation work to the stone walls in 1978. In the 1990s, the building operated for use as a retail shop for The National Trust of Australia (WA) and included a bookshop and restaurant. In 1995, the retail outlet was converted for use as a cafe by a private organisation. The Trust re-roofed the building in 2000 <U+2013> 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntwa.com.au/about/2000-2001/report-properties.shtml |title=2000-2001 Annual Report |publisher=National Trust (WA) |accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>
