'''''Uninvited''''' is a [[haunted house]] "[[point-and-click game|point-and-click]]" [[adventure game]] developed originally for the Apple [[Macintosh]]  by [[ICOM Simulations]] released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] by  [[Mindscape]].

The game uses the [[MacVenture]] engine that was introduced in ICOM's prior game, ''[[Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True]]''. It is notable as the only MacVenture that takes place in the present day.

A number of [[porting|ports]] were made, including a version for [[DOS]] in 1987, and for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in [[1991 in video gaming|1991]]. Two years later, a full [[rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] for Windows was released. For some time it was rumored there would be a sequel on the NES, but it never materialized. Employees at [[Infinite Ventures]] (maintainers of the MacVenture game series) indicate that no such game was ever planned.

==Plot and gameplay==
[[Image:Uninvited-Master Bedroom.png|thumb|left|A screenshot of the Macintosh version]]

The unnamed hero must find the way through an abandoned house in order to rescue a sibling. The quest involves magic and solving [[logic puzzle]]s while discovering sinister secrets of the house's former inhabitants.

The player regains consciousness from a car crash in front of a large, old [[mansion]].  The player's sibling (a younger brother in the computer version but an older sister in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version) is gone, and the car is soon lost, as it bursts into flames.  The only option is to enter the mansion looking for your sibling, and for help.

The main house consists of two floors and a tower, most parts being in early 20th century style.  Some rooms (e.g. the servant's bedroom) have newer decoration, suggesting that a younger person lived in that particular place.  No help is to be found, as there is not a single living soul inhabiting the house.  It is not long before the player is greeted by the first [[undead]] dweller, however.

It gradually becomes evident that the house once belonged to a [[magic (paranormal)|sorcerer]] with a number of apprentices. Dracan, the most talented apprentice, became corrupt and killed the other inhabitants with his magic, resulting in the house becoming [[haunted house|haunted]].

Aside from the house, there are three backyard buildings to explore: the [[observatory]], where some of the final events take place; the [[greenhouse]], which is not as [[infertile]] as it first seems; and the [[chapel]], which leads into a [[cemetery]] maze.  Several places are guarded by magical creatures, including [[apparition (supernatural)|apparitions]], [[hellhound]]s, and [[zombie]]s, as well as some more unconventional entities; one is a tiny [[demon]] that flies by periodically, holding a key.

The quest to rescue the player's sibling is mostly a matter of gaining access to the locked-up or guarded parts of the estate.  As in the other MacVenture games, there is a time limit; in this case, the [[evil]] presence of the mansion gradually takes control, and the player may eventually end up as a zombie.  This element is partially absent from the NES version, as it is instead caused by a useless item that may be avoided.  Since the story largely revolves around [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], many of the game's puzzles seem illogical.  Hints for these and bits of the background story are unraveled in the various diaries and scrolls found within the grounds.  Still, because the [[gameplay]] is very [[linearity (computer and video games)|non-linear]], the ending is somewhat abrupt.

==NES version==
As with the other [[MacVenture#NES ports|NES MacVenture]] games, ''Uninvited'' now had music and elements of the written [[narration]] and storyline were altered, including these:
* In the NES version, if the player uses the [[phonograph]] in the Game room (Rec room in original versions), you'll hear a broken-record version of the main theme from ''[[Shadowgate]]'', another NES-[[porting|ported]] game in the [[MacVenture]] series. (A similar gag appears in another point-and-click game, ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''.)
* As mentioned above, the sibling trapped in the mansion is changed from a younger brother to an older sister in the NES version.
* In the NES version, the player does not have a time limit unless it picks up the ruby in one of the bedrooms.  Even then, the player can drop the ruby and the time limit is terminated.
* As with the other NES ports, the game texts were severely simplified, in some cases also adding hints or elucidations for the gameplay. As an example, a hallway picture reads as follows in the NES version: ''It's a small, (sic) painting of a young fellow.''
* In the original game, the address was, "Master Crowley, [[666 (number)|666]] Blackwell Road, Loch Ness, Scotland". However, at the time the game was released, [[Nintendo]] had stringent policy necessitating the removal of any remotely offensive material.  <ref>{{cite web| last =  Crockford| first = Douglas| authorlink = Douglas Crockford| coauthors =| date =| year =| month =| url = http://crockford.com/wrrrld/maniac.html| title = The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion| work =| pages =| publisher =| language =| accessdate = June 5, 2006| curly =}}</ref><ref>[http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php Nintendo's Era of Censorship]</ref> Rather than create a new address, it was simply shortened to "Master Crowley". This is likely a reference to [[occult]]ist [[Aleister Crowley]], but Nintendo (perhaps unknowingly) allowed the name to remain in the game. Other changes that may relate to censorship issues, are pentagrams turned into stars (or, in one case, a ruby) and a cross into a chalice (while another cross that only served as decoration was removed altogether).
* Beyond the game texts being simplified for the NES port, some of the death texts were edited or altered due to their rather graphic descriptions.

==Reception==
German magazine ''Data Welt'' praised the Amiga version's user-friendliness, good graphics and particularly the atmospheric sound, calling the game (translated:) "excellent" and "even better than ''Deja Vu''".<ref>{{Citation | last = Tai | first = Th. | title = Uninvited | newspaper = Data Welt | pages = 174&ndash;175 | date = July/August 1987 issue}}</ref> ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' found the game to be enjoyable and innovative, praising the game's use of graphics and almost exclusive use of the mouse as a way of eliminating frustration. As such, the game was described as "much easier to work with than pure text or text and graphic adventure games."<ref name = "CGW">{{citation | date = Aug-September 1987 | last = Wagner | first = Roy | periodical = [[Computer Gaming World]] | title = Uninvited | pages = 40<U+2013>41}}</ref> ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' complimented the game, calling it "a truly horrifying adventure game and mystery that<U+2019>ll leave you shivering in the dark".<ref name="Dragon116">{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|author=Lesser, Hartley and Pattie|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|issue=116|date=December 1986|pages=69<U+2013>76}}</ref>
