'''Tomas Runar Svensson''' (born February 15, 1968 in [[Eskilstuna]], [[S<U+00F6>dermanland]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Team handball|handball]] player. He is currently playing for [[BM Valladolid|Pevafersa Valladolid]] and the [[Sweden national handball team]].

==Player career==
Growing up in [[Eskilstuna]] it was only natural for him to play for the towns handball team, [[GUIF]], and he was moved up to their senior squad at the age of fifteen. [[1988]], at the age of twenty, he made his first cap for Sweden and in 1990 he was one of the main forces in the national team who won the world championships. This success landed him a contract with [[BM Atl<U+00E9>tico de Madrid]] in [[Spain]] where he played for some time before moving to [[CD Bidasoa]]. With this team he won his first Spanish championship in [[1995]]. Right after this he moved to [[FC Barcelona Handbol|Barcelona]] where he stayed for several seasons, helping the team become the most prominent handball team in the world, winning just about everything there is to win - including international competitions like [[EHF Champions League]] and [[EHF Men<U+2019>s Champions Trophy]] as well as Spanish competitions like [[Liga ASOBAL]] and [[Copa del Rey de Balonmano]]. Svensson moved to [[Germany]] and [[HSV Hamburg]] for a short while before returning to Spain, this time to play for [[SDC San Antonio|Portland San Antonio]].
