==In fiction==
Ding Feng is briefly mentioned by name in the historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' by [[Luo Guanzhong]], which romanticises the historical events before and during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. He appeared in chapter 117 during the [[Conquest of Shu by Wei]]. When the [[Shu Han|Shu]] general [[Zhuge Zhan]] was under attack by [[Cao Wei|Wei]] forces at Mianzhu Pass (<U+7DBF><U+7AF9><U+95DC>), he requested reinforcements from [[Eastern Wu]]. The Wu emperor [[Sun Xiu]] ordered [[Ding Feng (elder)]], with Ding Feng (younger) and Sun Yi (<U+5B6B><U+7570>) as his deputies, to lead 50,000 troops to attack the Wei [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] of Shouchun (<U+58FD><U+6625>) in a bid to divert Wei attention away from Shu.<ref>(<U+8AF8><U+845B><U+77BB><U+5728><U+57CE><U+4E2D><U+FF0C><U+898B><U+4E8B><U+52E2><U+5DF2><U+903C><U+FF0C><U+4E43><U+4EE4><U+5F6D><U+548C><U+9F4E><U+66F8><U+6BBA><U+51FA><U+FF0C><U+5F80><U+6771><U+5433><U+6C42><U+6551><U+3002><U+548C><U+81F3><U+6771><U+5433><U+FF0C><U+898B><U+4E86><U+5433><U+4E3B><U+5B6B><U+4F11><U+FF0C><U+5448><U+4E0A><U+544A><U+6025><U+4E4B><U+66F8><U+3002><U+5433><U+4E3B><U+770B><U+7F77><U+FF0C><U+8207><U+7FA4><U+81E3><U+8A08><U+8B70><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+65E2><U+8700><U+4E2D><U+5371><U+6025><U+FF0C><U+5B64><U+8C48><U+53EF><U+5750><U+8996><U+4E0D><U+6551><U+FF1F><U+300D><U+5373><U+4EE4><U+8001><U+5C07><U+4E01><U+5949><U+70BA><U+4E3B><U+5E25><U+FF0C><U+4E01><U+5C01><U+3001><U+5B6B><U+7570><U+70BA><U+526F><U+5C07><U+FF0C><U+7387><U+5175><U+4E94><U+842C><U+FF0C><U+524D><U+5F80><U+6551><U+8700><U+3002><U+4E01><U+5949><U+9818><U+65E8><U+51FA><U+5E2B><U+FF0C><U+5206><U+64A5><U+4E01><U+5C01><U+3001><U+5B6B><U+7570><U+5F15><U+5175><U+4E8C><U+842C><U+5411><U+6C94><U+4E2D><U+800C><U+9032><U+FF0C><U+81EA><U+7387><U+5175><U+4E09><U+842C><U+5411><U+58FD><U+6625><U+800C><U+9032><U+FF0C><U+5206><U+5175><U+4E09><U+8DEF><U+800C><U+63F4><U+3002>) Luo Guanzhong.
