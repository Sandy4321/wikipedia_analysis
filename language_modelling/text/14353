== Biography ==
Born on April 5, 1989 in a humble neighborhood in Corrientes, Argentina.
At the age of 6, he moved with his family to Buenos Aires in search of better working conditions for his father and an opportunity of a better [[education]] for him and his brothers.
In his first years, he practiced several Olympic activities such as [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[gymnastics]], but at the age of 9 he started taking interest in Olympic Wrestling. He performed in a domestic level achieving very good results which ultimately encouraged him to compromise even further with the sport. His first appearance representing his country in an international event was in the year 2001 in [[Chile]], where he won a gold medal in the Barros Arana Tournament. Since that moment his name never ceased to appear in international, Panamerican and worldwide competitions.
Despite his young age, he achieved multiple international titles representing his country in a professional way. Among his most important accomplishments there are 9 Panamerican championship medals won in different age categories, turning him into the most achieving competitor in Argentina of his discipline. He was also recognized with several awards along the years both from the media and the government, naming him the best in his discipline and was nominated in several occasions for the Best Sportsman of the Argentine Republic.
As it is well known, Olympic Wrestling is not a popular sport in Argentina so Yuri was forced to travel abroad since the beginning of his career to be able to make a difference and grow in his development. He has spent several seasons training abroad in countries such as [[United States|USA]], [[Cuba]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]] and has spent many time away from his home. In order to accomplish the results he longs for, he will move in the year 2012 to [[Vladikavkaz]]en, Russia aiming for the [[Olympic Games]] at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 2016.
