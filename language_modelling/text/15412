'''Old Albany Post Road''' is a {{convert|6.6|mi|km|adj=on}} [[dirt road]] in [[Philipstown, New York|Philipstown]], New York, one of the oldest unpaved roads still in use in the [[United States]].<ref name="Old Road Society">{{cite web|title=Old Road Society of Philipstown|url=http://www.oldrdsoc.org/|publisher=Old Road Society of Philipstown|accessdate=December 22, 2008}}</ref> It runs mostly north-south through the southeastern corner of the town, near the [[Putnam Valley, New York|Putnam Valley]] town line. Starting from an intersection with Sprout Brook Road at Continental Village just north of the [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam]]-[[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] county line, it ends at an oblique junction with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US 9]] east of [[Garrison, New York|Garrison]].

As the least improved section of the original [[Albany Post Road]],<ref name="NRHP nom" /> it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1982. Its history as a formal road dates to the mid-17th century, when it was built on established [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trails. Later it would see military use, particularly by the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]], and commercial use as part of a [[stagecoach]] route. Some of the [[milestone]]s placed during the early years of [[American independence]] to more accurately calculate postal rates are still present and have been preserved and restored. It is still in public use and maintained by the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]]. The town has recently angered some of the residents by proposing to pave the road.

==Route==

Old Albany Post Road passes through heavily wooded and lightly populated country along the southeastern edge of the [[Hudson Highlands]]. Houses, many on large [[lot (real estate)|lots]], are the only development along the road, and there are no settlements along its length. The countryside is rugged, with the road going up and down several hills. Some areas are scenic, with [[meadow]]s and views of the nearby hills and mountains.

It branches off to the northwest at the point where Gallows Hill Road becomes Sprout Brook Road. From there it takes a west-northwestward, meandering course at first, narrowing almost to one lane at some points and climbing steadily to where the [[Catskill Aqueduct]] crosses, but soon bends to the north-northeast and widens. It climbs and then descends over the next two miles (3&nbsp;km) to the Lake Celeste area, where it becomes more northerly. Then it bends to the northeast again, going up and down several hills through mostly undeveloped areas, to Chapman Road, where the [[Appalachian Trail]] crosses.

Out of that intersection it resumes its northward course, traversing around Fort Defiance Mountain, to Canopus Hill Road. There it turns to the northwest. At the corner of Travis Corners Road, a [[monument]] explains the historical importance of the road. From here it runs almost straight north-northwest past some farms and more open land to cross Philipse Brook at the junction with Philipse Brook Road.

Beyond, the road remains mostly straight and northwestward, eventually returning to more wooded country along a ridgetop where the southwestern corner of [[Clarence Fahnestock State Park]] is nearby. It then turns more to the west and descends to the intersection with [[Indian Brook Road Historic District|Indian Brook Road]], near the Bird and Bottle Inn. From here it parallels nearby Route 9, reaching some more developed areas until it finally ends with a merge onto the highway.

==History==

All of the major work of building and widening the road was done during the [[Colonial America|colonial era]]. Old Albany Post Road has not seen much change since the mid-18th century. Later improvements in transportation technology diverted traffic away from it and have helped to preserve the road in its historic form.

===Colonial era===

In 1669 the government of [[New Netherland]] designated a postal route between what would later be [[New York City]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the colony's two most important cities at the time. It was little more than a narrow path in many places, following old trails used by the Wiccoppe and Wappinger tribes, who often carried the mail, starting two years later. The longest stretch included part of the current Old Albany Post Road. The colony eventually became the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] [[Province of New York]], and in 1703 its legislative body provided for the postal road to be a "public and common general highway" along the same route, starting in [[Kingsbridge, Bronx|Kingsbridge]] and ending at a ferry landing in present-day [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]].<ref name="NRHP nom" /> That legislation authorized the road to be as much as four [[Rod (length)|rods]] ({{convert|50|ft|m}}) wide where necessary. It was called the Queen's Road at first, after then-[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], and later the King's Road when she was succeeded by [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George II of Great Britain|II]].<ref name="oldrdsoc history page">{{cite web|title=Capsule History of the Old Albany|url=http://www.oldrdsoc.org/orshist.htm|publisher=Old Road Society of Philipstown|accessdate=December 22, 2008}}</ref>

As it became the main route between the two cities, local commerce began to serve the long-distance travelers. Inns are recorded along the road as early as the 1730s, when it was first widened for military use.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" /> The best-known, John Warren's Tavern, was built in 1756 and remains in use today as the Bird and Bottle Inn restaurant at the junction with Indian Brook Road.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The road received major improvements when the British Army realized it needed to improve defenses against the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] to the north in [[New France]] (today's [[Quebec]]). In 1754, it was widened again and trees were cleared to allow the transport of troops and materiel in greater numbers. Milestones were first known to have been placed in 1763, sometime after [[Benjamin Franklin]], who had advocated their use, was appointed the colonies' Joint [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]].<ref name="oldrdsoc milestone page">{{cite web|title=Milestone Mystery|url=http://www.oldrdsoc.org/milestones.htm|publisher=Old Road Society of Philipstown|accessdate=December 22, 2008}}</ref>

After the [[French and Indian War]], it would be used against the British by [[George Washington]]'s [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He [[retreat (military)|retreated]] to what was named Continental Village after the [[Battle of White Plains]] and the road remained fortified and defended throughout the war, used as a supply route,<ref name="NRHP nom" /> and often traveled by Washington and his officers.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> It was [[surveying|surveyed]] during the war and the first map published. Its milestone locations are not the extant ones.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" />

===18th and 19th centuries===
After the war, the new state began making further use of the road. A regular [[stagecoach]] route was chartered along the road by the [[New York state legislature|legislature]] in 1785, and the mileposts were upgraded by the end of the century. By then a regular mail route was in place, with riders going up the east side of the river and down another road on the west side on a weekly basis.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> 

In 1789 a new survey was taken and the old maps revised. These match today's known milestone locations along the entire former length of the road. A decade later, New York's Act to Regulate the Highways directed every county highway superintendent to place stone mile markers along the road. By the next year all the remaining mileposts had been placed.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" />

A private company built the Highlands Turnpike to the west, in more level country, and opened it in 1806. This diverted traffic away from the section north of [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]] through Continental Village and past the lakes. [[Iron mining]] at Hopper Lake in the 1820s partially replaced it, and the stage route was not changed.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" /> The old road fell into further disuse when the turnpike became a public highway in 1833 and it was no longer needed as a [[Shunpiking|shunpike]].<ref name="NRHP nom" /> The completion of the [[Hudson River Railroad]] to Albany in 1850 made the road obsolete as a commercial and postal artery, and stage service ended.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" />

===20th and 21st centuries===

Old Albany Post Road briefly assumed more than local importance once more in the 1910s, when the [[New York City water supply system]] was expanded to bring water to the city from [[Ashokan Reservoir]] in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]].  The road provided access to a section of the [[Catskill Aqueduct]], and shops, housing and bars were built along it to shelter and serve the construction workers.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" /> A decade later, Highlands Turnpike, by then the main north-south route through the county, was paved and formally designated as Route 9.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In 1921 a [[monument]] to the "Mothers of the Revolution" was placed at the southern end. Homes and farms along the road were [[Rural electrification|electrified]] in 1935 due to the efforts of the newly created [[Rural Electrification Administration]], adding [[utility pole]]s to the landscape.<ref name="oldrdsoc history page" /> A portion of the road near Travis Corners was surfaced in [[tar]] and [[gravel]] in the 20th century. Beyond that, it remains as it was in the mid-18th century.<ref name="NRHP nom" /> Following its NRHP listing, a group called the Old Road Society of Philipstown (ORSP) was formed to help preserve and promote it. Its membership is open to residents along the road and intersecting dirt roads.<ref name="Old Road Society"/>

The town has, in recent years, raised the possibility of [[Road surface|paving]] it, saying it would be cheaper to maintain and [[silt]]s up a paralleling brook through [[erosion]]. This has divided residents along Old Albany Post Road. Opponents point to its historic designation, character and rural charm, which would be lost if it were surfaced. Proponents, many near the road's southern end, cite [[public safety]] concerns such as inaccessibility for police and fire vehicles during [[washout]]s in heavy storms like the [[April 2007 Nor'easter]], which left craters four feet (1.3 m) deep in front of some [[driveway]]s. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] has given the town a [[grant (money)|grant]] to repair it, although it has not been decided whether it will be used for pavement or not.<ref name="NYT story">{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Joseph|title=A Fork in the Debate Over a Dirt Road|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/10colwe.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 8, 2008|accessdate=December 22, 2008}}</ref>

In November 2012, a local newspaper Philipstown.Info revealed that the Town of Philipstown budget contained proposed expenditures for paving sections of the town's historic dirt roads <ref>[http://philipstown.info/2012/11/16/town-plans-to-pave-dirt-road-sections-in-2013/ Town Plans to Pave Dirt Road Sections in 2013 | Philipstown.info<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> including 5300 feet of Old Albany Post Road in 2013-14 and an additional 7580 feet to be paved within 5 years.<ref>[Philipstown Highway Department 2013 Budget Planning Documents available at http://www.oldrdsoc.org/2013/index.htm]</ref> Until the paper revealed this information, residents of the road were unaware of the town's grand plans. The Philipstown Board cited three reasons for paving; the cost of maintaining dirt roads are too expensive, degradation of water quality in nearby streams, and safety.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://philipstown.info/2013/01/14/town-plan-for-paving-stirs-dirt-road-dust/ Town Plan for Paving Stirs Dirt Road Dust | Philipstown.info<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> If this plan were undertaken the Old Albany Post Road would lose almost 2.5 miles of historic road. Sections that the town wants to pave include two important historic areas; Saunders Farm and the hill that runs north to the famous revolutionary era Bird and Bottle Inn. There is considerable opposition to paving by local residents and a contentious town board workshop was held for Philipstown residents on January 16, 2013.<ref>[http://philipstown.info/2013/01/18/residents-of-dirt-roads-express-opposing-views-on-paving/ Residents of Dirt Roads Express Opposing Views on Paving | Philipstown.info<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Those in opposition to paving cite the historic, aesthetic, cultural, and recreational importance of leaving the road untouched. Many residents and an expert engineer presented information documenting that sound dirt road maintenance practices have not been utilized by the Town of Philipstown and if they were adopted would lead to cost savings, improvement in water quality, and thus preserve the historic nature of the road. Additionally other dirt road residents pointed out that drivers on dirt roads travel at significantly lower speeds reducing mortality in pedestrian vehicle accidents.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> It was also pointed out that the Town of Philipstown could be in violation of state bonding laws if they were to pave as proposed with merely a thin coat of asphalt and no substructure preparation.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Contributing historic resources==

The entire {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] authorized in 1703 is included in the NRHP listing. This means that many other aspects of the structure, like the adjacent [[stone wall]]s and [[shade tree]]s, are considered [[contributing property|contributing resources]] to the designation. The milestones are all included, even number 52, which is actually located on Gallows Hill Road slightly to the south of the fork at Sprout Hill.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

Some of the buildings along the road have been noted for their historic value by the ORSP. The Bird and Bottle Inn is a contributing property to the [[Indian Brook Road Historic District]], which itself includes part of the road as one of its contributing properties. In the two-mile (3.2&nbsp;km) section to its south there is also a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[farmhouse]] and 1770s in, both of which have seen more recent additions. Opposite Lake Celeste is Pine Run Farm, which dates to 1800.<ref name="ORSP map">{{cite web|title=Historic Map of Old Albany Post Road|url=http://www.oldrdsoc.org/map_med.gif|publisher=Old Road Society of Philipstown|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref>
