'''Raymond Couv<U+00E8>gnes''' was a French sculptor and medallist.

==Biography==

Raymond Couv<U+00E8>gnes was born in [[Ermont]] on 27 February 1893 and died in Paris on 15 December 1985. His father was Emile Couv<U+00E8>gnes, a director of the "Compagnie des chemin de fer du Nord" and a military historian. He showed an early talent for design and attended the  <U+00C9>cole d'arts appliqu<U+00E9>s Bernard Palissy before enroling at the <U+00C9>cole nationale sup<U+00E9>rieure des Beaux-Arts. He studied under Injalbert and in 1927 won the Prix de Rome for sculpture. His early works involved sculptural work which arose in the reconstruction of churches and town halls in Northern France where so much damaged had been sustained in the 1914<U+2013>1918 war. Examples of such work involved Montdidier town hall and churches in Roye, Arvillers, Moreuil, Le Bosquel and Athies. For the most part he worked using moulded concrete (b<U+00E9>ton moul<U+00E9>). In his next phase his works were executed in limestone or stone including in Paris a bust of Pierre Curie for the [[Palais de la D<U+00E9>couverte]], the statue of Claude Bernard in front of the [[coll<U+00E8>ge de France]] and of Queen Astrid for Paris' Cit<U+00E9> universitaire and the work "La Femme au bain" in the Parc de la Butte du Chapeau Rouge. Outside of Paris, Couv<U+00E8>gnes worked on a bust and bas-relief of Raymond Poincar<U+00E9> in [[Bar-le-Duc]], a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt in [[Cesnay]], a memorial to the efforts of the French resistance in [[Neuvic, Corr<U+00E8>ze|Neuvic]] and in [[Amboise]] a monument dedicated to the liberators of France. To this we can add a striking decoration to [[Lille]]'s "La voix du Nord" building, decoration to the old chamber of commerce in [[Poitiers]] and to the Boulogne-Billancourt H<U+00F4>tel de Ville and outside of France he created a bust of Mauritius' pioneer in cane sugar and a "Chemin de Croix"  (Stations of the Cross) for a convent in [[Alexandria]]. He created escutcheons for factories in the [[Rhin]] and for educational establishments in Ermont, Boulogne, Franconville, Poitiers, St-Cyr, Co<U+00EB>tquidam and Sannois. Also between 1956 and 1973 he worked for EDF on sculptural decoration for their nuclear and hydroelectric power stations. He set up the <U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts de Boulogne-Billancourt where he lived and taught there for many years.

=="Le R<U+00E9>mouleur"==

In 1920 Couv<U+00E8>gnes submitted a design drawing for that year's Prix Bridan run by the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts and they hold a copy in their records. It appears he was awarded the second prize. This is perhaps the earliest insight into Couv<U+00E8>gnes abilities.

== Eglise Saint-Vast==

In 1929, Couvegnes executed sculptural work for the Saint-Vast fa<U+00E7>ade. The church is in [[Moreuil]]. The church had suffered damage in the 1914<U+2013>1918 war, and the architects Charles Duval and Emmanuel Gonse were commissioned to restore the church. Reinforced cement was used in the reconstruction. Apart from Couvegnes' sculptures the church has paintings by Henri Marret, and mosaics by Jean Gaudin. Andr<U+00E9> Rinuy  and Jean H<U+00E9>bert-Stevens had executed the stained glass windows. These were destroyed in 1940 and replaced after the war.

==[[Arvillers]] Parish Church==

Another town ravaged by war in 1914<U+2013>1918 where the church needed reconstruction and another instance of Charles Duval and Emmanuel Gonse carrying out the design and using reinforced concrete. The <U+00C9>glise Saint-Martin was a 17th Century church. Couv<U+00E8>gnes executed the new typanum over the church entrance. In 1929 the painter Henri Marret carried out a remarkable "Chemin de croix (Stations of the Cross).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://henrimarret-peintre.fr/Marret-CDC-Arvilliers.htm

==[[Athies, Somme|Athies]] Parish Church==

Athies' <U+00C9>glise Notre Dame de l'Assomption dates to the 12th Century and was classified as a "monument historique" in 1862. The church was badly damaged in the 1914<U+2013>1918 war although the 13th Century tympanum depicting the nativity and the flight to Egypt was saved. After the war Raymond  Couv<U+00E8>gnes took part in the restoration and was responsible for several statues and some decoration to the altar. The church has some remarkable stained glass and other glasswork by Jean Gaudin.

==<U+00C9>glise Saint-Pierre de Roye==

[[File:Roye <U+00C9>glise Saint-Pierre.JPG|thumb|centre|350px|View of Roye's <U+00C9>glise Saint-Pierre showing part rebuilt in reinforced concrete]]
Raymond Couv<U+00E8>gnes was a pioneer in the use of moulded reinforced concrete ("b<U+00E9>ton moul<U+00E9>") and this medium was used for some of the church's decoration. Much of the area of [[Picardy]] was on the front line in the 1914<U+2013>1918 war and, as a consequence, suffered from destruction from artillery and other fire. [[Roye, Somme|Roye]] was no exception and the [[Renaissance]] church of Saint-Pierre, classified as a "monument historique" in 1908, suffered considerable damage. The reconstruction of the Roye church was put in the hands of the Paris architects Charles Duval and Emmanuel Gonse and althoqugh they were able to restore the choir area to its original "flamboyant" style, much of the remainder of the building had to be completely rebuilt and, in the interests of economy, much use was made of reinforced concrete. This was very much in vogue and had been developed as a building material by the [[Auguste Perret|Perret]] brothers. Visitors to [[Amien]] will recall the Perret tower. In the attached photograph we can see the contrasting styles and the parts rebuilt in concrete. These two architects had used Raymond Couv<U+00E8>gnes when rebuilding the [[Montdidier, Somme|Montdidier]] H<U+00F4>tel de ville (town hall) and for the Roye church they commissioned him to execute several sculptural works in the church's interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fresques.ina.fr/picardie/fiche-media/Picard00418/une-eglise-de-la-reconstruction-a-roye.html

==Claude Bernard==

The [[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]] dates back to 1530 when it was founded as the "Coll<U+00E8>ge Royal" and in front of the college is a statue of [[Claude Bernard]].

[[Image:Montdidier H<U+00F4>tel-de-ville (peinture escalier) 1.jpg|thumb| centre|300px|Maurice Pico painting inside Montdidier town hall]]

The Paris architects Charles Duval and Emmanuel Gonse took charge of the reconstruction of the town hall in 1927; it had been almost totally destroyed in 1918. They rebuilt it in the original "Flemish" style but using bricks and concrete and much of the interior decoration was carried out in the "Art deco" style. The exterior of the building was decorated with Montdidier's motto "Urbs cultissima", the arms of the town and reproductions of the L<U+00E9>gion d'Honneur and la Croix de Guerre. On the fa<U+00E7>ade they commissioned Couv<U+00E8>gnes to execute bas-reliefs depicting "les techniques", "les arts", "L'<U+00E9>volution du progr<U+00E8>s" and the riches of the [[Santerre (region)|Santerre]] region whilst Maurice Pico was commissioned to execute some paintings. Couv<U+00E8>gnes also executed a [[Marianne]] for the interior and sculpted the head of a child for the [[keystone (architecture)|keystone]] (cl<U+00E9> de vo<U+00FB>te).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoine-histoire.fr/Patrimoine/Montdidier/Montdidier-Mairie-Beffroi.htm
