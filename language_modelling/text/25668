'''Dorothea Lange''' (May 26, 1895&nbsp;<U+2013> October 11, 1965) was an influential [[United States|American]] documentary [[photographer]] and [[photojournalist]], best known for her [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era work for the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA). Lange's photographs humanized the consequences of the Great Depression and influenced the development of [[documentary photography]].

== Early life ==
Born of second generation German immigrants on May 26, 1895, at 1041 Bloomfield Street, [[Hoboken, New Jersey]],<ref name=enc>Lurie, Maxine N. and Mappen, Marc. ''Encyclopedia of New Jersey''. 2004, page 455</ref><ref name=vau>Vaughn, Stephen L. ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism''. 2008, page 254</ref> Dorothea Lange was named Dorothea Margaretta Nutzhorn at birth. She dropped her middle name and assumed her mother's maiden name after her father abandoned the family when she was 12 years old, one of two traumatic incidents early in her life. The other was her contraction of [[polio]] at age seven which left her with a weakened right leg and a permanent limp.<ref name=enc /><ref name=vau /> "It formed me, guided me, instructed me, helped me and humiliated me," Lange once said of her altered gait. "I've never gotten over it, and I am aware of the force and power of it."<ref name=cr>{{cite web|url=http://www.crmagazine.org/archive/SpringSummer2010/Pages/DorotheaLangeEsophagealCancer.aspx |title=Corrina Wu, "American Eyewitness", '&#39;CR Magazine'&#39;, Spring/Summer 2010 |publisher=Crmagazine.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>

Lange was educated in photography at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], in a class taught by [[Clarence H. White]]. She was informally apprenticed to several New York photography studios, including that of the famed [[Arnold Genthe]]. In 1918, she moved to [[San Francisco]], and by the following year she had opened a successful portrait studio.<ref name=vau /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/picturing_the_century/text/port_lange_text.html |title=Dorothea Lange |quote=Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, Dorothea Lange (1895<U+2013>1965) announced her intention to become a photographer at age 18. After apprenticing with a photographer in New York City, she moved to San Francisco and in 1919 established her own studio. |publisher=[[NARA]] |accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref> She lived across the bay in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for the rest of her life. In 1920, she married the noted western painter [[Maynard Dixon]], with whom she had two sons, Daniel, born in 1925, and John, born in 1930.<ref name="profile">{{cite news |title=Dorothea Lange: Photographer of the People |accessdate=2007-06-17 |last=Oliver |first=Susan |date=2003-12-07 }}</ref>

With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], Lange turned her camera lens from the studio to the street. Her studies of unemployed and homeless people captured the attention of local photographers and led to her employment with the federal [[Resettlement Administration]] (RA), later called the [[Farm Security Administration]] (FSA).

In December 1935, she divorced Dixon and married economist [[Paul Schuster Taylor]], Professor of Economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="profile"/> Taylor educated Lange in social and political matters, and together they documented rural poverty and the exploitation of [[sharecroppers]] and migrant laborers for the next five years&nbsp;<U+2013> Taylor interviewing and gathering economic data, Lange taking photos.

===Resettlement Administration===
From 1935 to 1939, Dorothea Lange's work for the [[Resettlement Administration|RA]] and [[Farm Security Administration|FSA]] brought the plight of the poor and forgotten&nbsp;<U+2013> particularly sharecroppers, displaced farm families, and migrant workers&nbsp;<U+2013> to public attention. Distributed free to newspapers across the country, her poignant images became icons of the era.

Lange's best-known picture is titled "Migrant Mother."<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2006/04/30/stories/2006043000380500.htm Migrant Mother: The True Story]</ref> The woman in the photo is [[Florence Owens Thompson]]. The original photo featured Florence's thumb and index finger on the tent pole, but the image was later retouched to hide Florence's thumb. Her index finger was left untouched (lower right in photo).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1960, Lange spoke about her experience taking the photograph:

{{Quote|I saw and approached the hungry and desperate mother, as if drawn by a magnet. I do not remember how I explained my presence or my camera to her, but I do remember she asked me no questions. I made five exposures, working closer and closer from the same direction. I did not ask her name or her history. She told me her age, that she was thirty-two. She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed. She had just sold the tires from her car to buy food. There she sat in that lean-to tent with her children huddled around her, and seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me. There was a sort of equality about it.<ref>(Popular Photography, Feb. 1960)</ref>}}

After Lange returned home, she told the editor of a San Francisco newspaper about conditions at the camp and provided him with two of her photos. The editor informed federal authorities and published an article that included the photos. As a result, the government rushed aid to the camp to prevent starvation.<ref name="americanmasters"/>

According to Thompson's son, Lange got some details of this story wrong, but the impact of the picture was based on the image showing the strength and need of migrant workers.<ref name="newtimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.newtimes-slo.com/archives/cov_stories_2002/cov_01172002.html#top  | title=Photographic license | first=Geoffrey | last=Dunne | publisher=[[New Times Media|New Times]] | year=2002 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020602103656/http://www.newtimes-slo.com/archives/cov_stories_2002/cov_01172002.html#top |archivedate = 2002-06-02}}</ref>

===Japanese American internment===
In 1941, Lange was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for excellence in photography. After the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], she gave up the prestigious award to record the forced evacuation of [[Japanese Americans]] from the West Coast, on assignment for the [[War Relocation Authority]] (WRA).<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Hayward, California, Two Children of the Mochida Family who, with Their Parents, Are Awaiting Evacuation|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2736|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}</ref>  She covered the [[Japanese American internment|internment of Japanese Americans]]<ref>[http://freedomvoices.org/1langepx/wra531.htm Civil Control Station, Registration for evacuation and processing.

Much of her work focused on the waiting and uncertainty involved the removal: piles of luggage waiting to be sorted, families wearing identification tags and waiting for transport.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alinder |first=Jasmine |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Dorothea_Lange/ |title=Dorothea Lange |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> To many observers, her photograph<ref>[http://freedomvoices.org/1langepx/wra78.htm Pledge of allegiance at Rafael Weill Elementary School a few weeks prior to evacuation], April, 1942.

''Women's Camera Work''. 1998, page 280</ref>

Her images were so obviously critical that the Army impounded most of them, and they were not seen publicly for more than 50 years.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/arts/design/06lang.html Dinitia Smith, NY Times, Nov. 2006, ''Photographs of an Episode That Lives in Infamy'' Retrieved March 17, 2011]</ref> Today her photographs of the internment are available in the National Archives on the website of the Still Photographs Division, and at the Bancroft Library of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

===California School of Fine Arts===
In 1945, Lange was invited by [[Ansel Adams]] to accept a position as faculty at the first fine art photography department at the [[San Francisco Art Institute|California School of Fine Arts]] (CSFA). [[Imogen Cunningham]] and [[Minor White]] joined as well.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Mix |url=http://www.verlang.com/sfbay0004ref_timeline_05.html |title=Vernacular Language North. SF Bay Area Timeline. '&#39;Modernism (1930<U+2013>1960)'&#39; |publisher=Verlang.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}</ref>

In 1952, Lange co-founded the photographic magazine ''[[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture]]''. Lange and [[Pirkle Jones]] were commissioned in the mid-1950s to shoot a photographic documentary for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] of the death of [[Monticello, California]] and of the displacement of its residents by the damming of [[Putah Creek]] to form [[Lake Berryessa]]. The magazine did not run the piece, so Lange devoted one whole issue of ''Aperture'' to the work. The photo collection was shown at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1960.<ref>BellaVistaRanch.net.

In the last two decades of her life, Lange's health was poor. She suffered from gastric problems, including bleeding [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], as well as [[post-polio syndrome]]&nbsp;<U+2013> although this renewal of the pain and weakness of polio was not yet recognized by most physicians.

== Death and legacy==
Lange died of [[esophageal cancer]] on October 11, 1965 in San Francisco, California at age 70.<ref name="profile"/><ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Dorothea Lange Is Dead at 70.

In 1972 the Whitney Museum used 27 of Lange's photographs in an exhibit entitled Executive Order 9066. This exhibit highlighted the Japanese Internment during World War II.

In 2006, an elementary school was named in her honor in [[Nipomo, California]], near the site where she photographed "Migrant Mother".

On May 28, 2008, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and First Lady [[Maria Shriver]] announced Lange's induction into the [[California Hall of Fame]], located at [[The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts]]. The induction ceremony took place on December 15 and her son accepted the honor in her place.
