'''Peking Duck''', or '''Peking Roast Duck''' ({{zh-stp|s=<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+70E4><U+9E2D>|t=<U+5317><U+4EAC><U+70E4><U+9D28>|p=B<U+011B>ij<U+012B>ng k<U+01CE>o y<U+0101>}}), is a famous [[duck dish]] from [[Beijing]]. The name comes from the traditional, pre-[[Hanyu Pinyin]] [[anglicization]] of the name of Beijing. It is also known as '''Beijing Duck''' or '''Beijing Roast Duck'''.

The dish is mostly prized for the thin, crispy skin with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat.  Most [[China|Chinese]] [[restaurant]]s will make two dishes out of one duck -- one with thin slices of skin with a small layer of fat, or none at all, underneath, and another one with the duck meat.  The latter is often a [[stir-fry]] dish. The bones are boiled to make duck broth, either by the restaurant, or optionally, packed up for home preparation.

The history of the Peking Duck can be traced as far back as the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1206 - 1368). By the time of the early [[15th century]] it had become one of the favorite dishes of the imperial [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] family.

The two most famous restaurants in Beijing which serve this specialty are [[Quanjude]] and [[Bianyifang]] (<U+4FBF><U+5B9C><U+574A>)  which each serve a specific genre of Beijing Roast Duck. Bianyifang makes the duck in an enclosed oven, while Quanjude makes the duck in a hung oven.<ref>http://english.bjta.gov.cn/jhms/ctcx/50502.htm</ref> Both establishments have a history of well over a hundred years and have an extensive network of chain stores.

By the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong Period]] (1736-1796) of the [[Qing Dynasty]], the popularity of the Peking Duck spread to the upper classes, inspiring poetry from some scholars who have eaten the dish. For instance, one of the verses of ''Duan Zhu Zhi Ci'', a collection of Beijing poems was, "Fill your plates with roast duck and [[suckling pig]]".<ref name=Chinaorg>{{cite web

By the mid [[20th century]], the Peking Duck has become a national symbol of China, favoured by tourists and diplomats alike. For example, [[Henry Kissinger]], the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State of the United States]] dined with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] in the [[Great Hall of the People]] on [[July 10]], during his first visit to China. The delegation was served Peking Duck for the main course, which became Kissinger's favourite. The Americans and Chinese issued a joint statement the following day, inviting President [[Richard Nixon]] to visit China in 1972. Following Zhou's death in 1976, Kissinger paid another visit to Beijing to savour Peking Duck.<ref>{{cite web

=== Raising the duck ===
The ducks used to prepare Peking Duck originated from [[Nanjing]]. Those mallards were small and had black feathers, and lived in the canals linking strategic rivers. With the relocation of the Chinese capital to Beijing, supply barges spilt a large amount of grain which the ducks fed on. As a result, the ducks slowly increased in size and grew white feathers. By the [[Five Dynasties]], the new species of duck has been domesitcated by Chinese farmers.<ref>{{cite book

Peking Duck is traditionally roasted in either a closed oven or hung oven. The closed oven is built of [[brick]] and fitted with metal griddles ({{zh-cp|c=<U+7B85><U+5B50>|p=b<U+00EC> zi}}). The oven is preheated by burning Gaoliang wood ({{zh-cp|c=<U+79EB><U+79F8>|p=sh<U+00FA> ji<U+0113>}}) at the base. The duck is placed in the oven immediately after the fire burns out, allowing the meat to be slowly cooked through the [[convection]] of heat within the oven.<ref name = ET/><ref>{{cite web

The hung oven was developed in the in the imperial kitchens during the Qing Dynasty and adopted by the [[Quanjude]] restaurant chain. It is designed to roast up to 20 ducks at the same time with an open fire fuelled by [[hardwood]] from [[peach]] or [[pear]] trees.<ref name = ET/><ref name = GL/> The ducks are hung on hooks above the fire and roasted at a temperature of 270[[degree Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] for 30<U+2013>40 minutes. While the ducks are cooking, the chef may use a pole to dangle each duck closer to the fire for 30 second intervals.<ref name=GL/> 

Besides the traditional methods to prepare Peking duck, recipes have been compiled by chefs around the world to produce the dish at home.<Ref name = ABC/><ref name = Devon/>

== Serving ==
[[Image:Quanjude roastduck.JPG|thumb|A [[Quanjude]] chef slicing roasted Peking Duck.]]
The cooked Peking Duck is traditionally carved in front of the diners and served in three stages. First, the skin is served dipped in sugar and garlic sauce. The meat is then served with steamed [[pancake]]s ({{zh-cp|c=<U+8377><U+53F6><U+997C>|p=h<U+00E9>y<U+00E8> b<U+01D0>ng}}, literally lotus leaf pancakes), [[scallion]]s and [[plum sauce]]. Several vegetables are provided to accompany the meat, typically [[cucumber]] and [[carrot]] sticks. The diners spread plum sauce, and optionally sugar, over the pancake. The pancake is wrapped around the meat with the vegetables and eaten by hand, much like a [[burrito]]. The remaining fat, meat and bones can be made into a [[broth]]. Otherwise, they are packed up to be taken home by the customers.<ref>{{cite web

=== Reheating ===
Whole Peking Ducks can be ordered as [[takeaway]]s. The ducks can be reheated at home with an oven, grill or boiling oil. When an oven is used, the duck is heated at a temperature of 150<U+00B0>C for 20 minutes, and then at 160<U+00B0>C for another 10 minutes. The grilling method involves filling the duck with boiling water before placing it on a griddle, 70 cm above the cooking fire. The boiling water is replaced every 3<U+2013>4 minutes until the duck's skin is piping hot. To reheat the Peking Duck with oil, the duck is sliced into thin pieces and placed in a [[strainer]] held over a [[wok]] of boiling oil. The duck is then rinsed several times with the oil.<ref name = Takeaway/>

==Crispy Aromatic Duck==
Crispy aromatic duck is a variant of Peking duck that originated in the Chinese community in the [[United Kingdom]]. In this version, the duck is rubbed with aromatic spices such as [[five-spice powder]] and then deep fried instead of roasted. This enables the meat to be flaked off the bone and shredded easily, a process which is usually performed in front of the patrons of the restaurant. This deep-fried shredded meat is then served with pancakes, finely chopped cucumber and [[spring onions]] (sometimes [[leek]] is substituted), [[hoisin sauce]] (or rarely [[plum sauce]]).
