'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Madagascar]] on 3 December 2006.<sup>[http://www.mherrera.org/elections.htm]</sup> President [[Marc Ravalomanana]], in office since he prevailed in a dispute over election results in 2002, ran for re-election. On 9 December, Ravalomanana was declared to have won in the first round with about 55 percent of the vote.<ref name=Declared>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/09/africa/AF_POL_Madagascar_Elections.php "Madagascar's president wins election"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), December 9, 2006.</ref>

Exiled former deputy prime minister [[Pierrot Rajaonarivelo]] of the [[Association for the Rebirth of Madagascar|AREMA]] opposition party tried to run for president, and was considered Ravalomanana's main opponent,<ref name=Harris>Ed Harris, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=qw1160370182571B253 "Madagascar airport shut to stop Rajaonarivelo"], Reuters (''IOL''), October 9, 2006.</ref><ref name=QA>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6159193.stm "Q & A: Madagascar election"], ''[[BBC News Online]]'', December 1, 2006.</ref> but he was barred from participation; he was not allowed to enter the country (on one occasion the airport at the eastern city of [[Toamasina]] was closed to keep him out, and when he tried again to enter the country he was not allowed aboard a plane in nearby [[Mauritius]]),<ref name=Fair>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=61570 "Hoping for fair, transparent, uncontroversial elections"], ''[[IRIN]]'', November 15, 2006.</ref>  and his registration papers, which he could not sign because he was not allowed into the country, were rejected because he had not signed them himself. During his exile, Rajaonarivelo was convicted of misuse of funds, and he could be arrested if he returns to Madagascar. Fourteen other presidential candidates were approved on October 18, while three others were rejected for not paying a required deposit.<ref>[http://www.afrol.com/articles/22089 "Madagascar court rejects polls challenger, clears 14"], afrol News, October 20, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/pays/madagascar/article_depeche.asp?art_cle=AFP85336candielleit0 "14 candidats autoris<U+00E9>s <U+00E0> se pr<U+00E9>senter <U+00E0> la pr<U+00E9>sidentielle"], AFP (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), October 18, 2006.</ref>

In May, the date of the election was moved forward to December 3, several weeks earlier than had previously been expected. The reason given was that the earlier date could avoid having the election affected by bad weather during the rainy season; the constitutional court approved the new date, saying that it did not violate the constitution. The constitution says an election should be held between 30 and 60 days before the end of a president's mandate.<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=qw1147332961886A162 "Speaker eyes presidency as Iran row deepens"], AFP (''IOL''), May 11, 2006.</ref> Many of the opposition candidates did not like the earlier date and wanted the election to be postponed;<ref name=Fair/><ref name=Hope>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=iol1160946777925B253 "Presidential hopefuls put their names forward"], AFP (''IOL''), October 16, 2006.</ref> they said that the constitution required that the election not be held before December 25.<ref name=Hope/>

Aside from Ravalomanana, presidential candidates included former deputy prime minister [[Herizo Razafimahaleo]], former prime minister and acting president [[Norbert Ratsirahonana]], [[Roland Ratsiraka]], nephew of former president [[Didier Ratsiraka]] and mayor of Toamasina,<ref name=Far>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=62275 "So far, so good in presidential election"], IRIN, December 4, 2006.</ref> and [[Jean Lahiniriko]], who was Speaker of the National Assembly from 2003 until earlier in 2006.<ref name=QA/> One woman also ran for president, [[Elia Ravelomanantsoa]].<ref name=QA/>

In mid November, retired general [[Andrianafidisoa]], commonly known as Fidy, whose candidacy had been rejected for failing to pay the deposit, had leaflets distributed announcing [[2006 Malagasy coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|a military takeover]]; describing Ravalomanana's government as unconstitutional, he called for the military to support him. This led to a clash at a military base in which one soldier was reported killed, and Ravalomanana's plane, carrying him back to Madagascar, had to be diverted from the capital, [[Antananarivo]], to another part of the country.<ref name=IHT>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/18/africa/AF_GEN_Madagascar_Election_Tension.php "Retired Madagascar army general calls for military support against president"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), November 18, 2006.</ref><ref>Johnny Hogg, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6161398.stm "Madagascar general urges overthrow"], [[BBC News]], November 18, 2006.</ref><ref name=Fizzle>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=61615 "Attempted "coup" fizzles in desire for peaceful poll"], IRIN, November 20, 2006.</ref>  Subsequently the situation was described as calm and without any sign of a military takeover.<ref name=IHT/> A warrant for Fidy's arrest was issued, and Fidy subsequently denied that there had been a coup attempt, calling that a misinterpretation.<ref name=Fizzle/> On November 22, Fidy received the backing of most<!--cited sources differ, either eight or 11--> of the presidential candidates, who said he was defending the constitution and the interests of the nation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6177942.stm "Support for Madagascar 'coup bid'"], BBC News, November 23, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/fluxafp/fil_info.asp?reg_id=0&art_cle=33243 "Madagascar: 11 candidats de l'opposition jugent l<U+00E9>gitime l'action du g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral "Fidy""], AFP (''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeuneafrique.com]]''), November 22, 2006 {{fr icon}}.</ref> A few days after the election, the government unsuccessfully attempted to arrest one of the candidates who backed Fidy, [[Pety Rakotoniaina]], the mayor of [[Fianarantsoa]].<ref name=Pety>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/07/africa/AF_POL_Madagascar_Elections.php "Madagascar tries to arrest opposition politician, offers bounty for attempted coup leader"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), December 7, 2006.</ref> The government denied that this was because of his support for Fidy and accused him of other crimes,<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-12-07-voa41.cfm "Madagascar Issues Arrest Warrant for Opposition Candidate"], Voice of America, December 7, 2006.</ref> including holding an illegal gathering the day before the election, after the end of campaigning.<ref name=Pety/> Fidy was captured on December 12;<ref>Alain Iloniaina, [http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=qw1165995901478B253 "Madagascar captures renegade general "Fidy""], Reuters (''IOL''), December 13, 2006.</ref> Rakotoniaina was not captured until July 2007.<ref>[http://www.madagascar-tribune.com/index.php?JOURNAL=1257&ART=24288 "Pety Rakotoniaina; Fin de l<U+2019><U+00E9>pisode, apr<U+00E8>s 7 mois de cavale"], ''Madagascar Tribune'', N<U+00B0> 5611, July 20, 2007 {{fr icon}}.</ref>
