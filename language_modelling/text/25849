'''Unity Temple''' is a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] [[church (building)|church]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], and the home of the Unity Temple Unitarian Universalist Congregation. It was designed by the American architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], and built between 1905 and 1908. Unity Temple is considered to be one of Wright's most important structures dating from the first decade of the twentieth century. Because of its consolidation of aesthetic intent and structure through use of a single material, [[reinforced concrete]], Unity Temple is considered by many architects to be the first [[Modern architecture|modern building]] in the world. This idea became of central importance to the modern architects who followed Wright, such as [[Mies Van Der Rohe]], and even the post-modernists, such as [[Frank Gehry]].

Unity Temple is located at 875 Lake Street, Oak Park Illinois. (The Unitarian Universalist congregation that owns and worships in Unity Temple was formed in 1871, and has no connection with [[Unity Church]], a religious organization founded in 1889.)

==Background==
[[Image:UnityTempleOakHill.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior of the Unity Temple.]]
In 1905, after the original Unity Church burned down, the [[Universalist]] congregation of Oak Park, Illinois turned to architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] to design them a new structure. The result was Unity Temple. Wright was not only living in Oak Park, but was a Unitarian - which faith then had many beliefs in common with Universalism. The [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] needed a space of [[worship]], as well as a community room. There were several immediate problems that the architect had to work with in order to satisfy the client. The [[budget]] for the Universalist congregation was rather small for its needs: $40,000 US [[dollar]]s; and the proposed building site was long, but not very wide. Additionally, the building site stood on a busy street. And finally, the architect was expected to design not only the structure, but [[furniture]] and [[stained glass]] for the building. Charles E. Roberts, an engineer, inventor and an important early client of Frank Lloyd Wright, served on the church's building committee and was a key figure in seeing that Wright's vision for the church became a reality.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright: An Autobiography, by Frank Lloyd Wright, pp. 153, 158, 383</ref> For Roberts, Wright also remodeled Roberts' home and the [[Charles E. Roberts Stable]].

==Design and construction==

To accommodate the needs of the congregation, Wright divided the community space from the temple space through a low, middle [[loggia]] that could be approached from either side. This was an efficient use of space and kept down on noise between the two main gathering areas: those coming for religious services would be separated via the loggia from those coming for community events. This design was one of Wright's first uses of a bipartite design: with two portions of the building similar in composition and separated by a lower passageway, and one section being larger than the other. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]] is another bipartite design.

To reduce noise from the street, Wright eliminated street level windows in the temple. Instead, natural light comes from stained glass windows in the roof and [[clerestory|clerestories]] along the upper walls. Because the members of the parish would not be able to look outside, Unity Temple's stained glass was designed with green, yellow, and brown tones in order to evoke the colors of nature. The main floor of the temple is accessed via a lower floor (which has seating space), and the room also has two balconies for the seating of the congregation. These varying seating levels allowed the architect to design a building to fit the size of the congregation, but efficiently: no one person in the congregation is more than 40 [[foot (length)|feet]] from the [[pulpit]]. Wright also designed the building with very good [[acoustics]]. 

The design of Unity Temple represents a leap forward in design for Wright. In recounting his experiences with Unity Temple, he stated that this design was the first time he ever realized that the real heart of a building is its space, not its walls. Indeed, architectural historians have commented on Wright's genius in creating and manipulating space in his designs; in his book ''The Master Builders'', Peter Blake entitled the section on Wright "The Mastery of Space." 

The building was completed in 1908 and officially dedicated on September 26, 1909. The original Universalist (now Unitarian Universalist) congregation [http://unitytemple.org/] still owns and uses Unity Temple, although a separate and secular organization, the Unity Temple Restoration Foundation [http://www.unitytemple-utrf.org/], is in charge of the building's multi-million dollar restoration effort.  Chicago restoration architect Gunny Harboe is in charge of the restoration with [[CTLGroup]] providing the engineering and materials technology expertise. In April 2009, Unity Temple, due to water seepage, was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 11 most endangered historic places<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times">{{cite news|title=Unity Temple on list of endangered U.S. historic sites|date=April 28, 2009|page=4|language=English|accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/28/arts/design/28enda.html?_r=1 New York Times, April 27, 2009, accessed April 29, 2009]</ref>

==Significance==
The building has been a [[United States]] [[National Historic Landmark]] since 1971 and was chosen in a 1991 [[opinion poll|poll]] in the [[magazine]], ''Architectural Record'' as one of the 100 most significant buildings in the United States of the previous 100 years (Unity Temple was #6). Additionally, Unity Temple was chosen by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as one of 17 buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright <ref>http://www.delmars.com/wright/flw8.htm</ref> that should be retained as his architectural contribution to American [[culture]].

In 2008, the [[United States Park Service|U.S. National Park Service]] submitted Unity Temple, along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties, to a tentative list for World Heritage Status. The 10 sites have been submitted as one, total, site. The January 22, 2008 press release from the National Park Service website announcing the nominations states that, "The preparation of a Tentative List is a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List."<ref>http://www.nps.gov/oia/topics/worldheritage/New_Tentative_List.htm</ref>
