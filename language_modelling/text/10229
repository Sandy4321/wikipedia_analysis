{{Redirect|Rukiah|the Indonesian poet|Siti Rukiah}}
'''Roekiah''' ([[EYD|Perfected Spelling]] '''Rukiah'''; {{IPA-id|ru<U+02C8>kiah|}}; 1917<U+2013>1945), often credited as '''Miss Roekiah''',{{efn|At the time, female stage performers, especially ''keroncong'' singers, were billed with "Miss" on advertisements {{harv|JCG, Roekiah, Miss}}.}} was an Indonesian ''[[keroncong]]'' singer and film actress. The daughter of two stage performers, she began her career at the age of seven; by 1932 she had become well-known in [[Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Jakarta, Indonesia),  as a singer and stage actress. Around this time she met [[Kartolo]], whom she married in 1934. The two acted in the 1937 hit ''[[Terang Boelan]]'', in which Roekiah and [[Rd Mochtar]] played young lovers.

After the film's commercial success, Roekiah, Kartolo, and most of the cast and crew of ''Terang Boelan'' were signed to [[Tan's Film]], first appearing for the company in their 1938 production ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]''. They acted together in two more films before Mochtar left the company in 1940; through these films, Roekiah and Mochtar became the colony's first on-screen couple. Mochtar's replacement, [[Djoemala|Rd Djoemala]], acted with Roekiah in four films, although these were less successful. After the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese invaded the Indies]] in 1942, Roekiah took only one more film role before her death; most of her time was used entertaining Japanese forces.

During her life Roekiah was a fashion and beauty icon, featuring in advertisements and drawing comparisons to [[Dorothy Lamour]] and [[Janet Gaynor]]. Though most of the films in which she appeared are now lost, she has continued to be cited as a film pioneer, and a 1969 article stated that "in her time [Roekiah] reached a level of popularity which, one could say, has not been seen since".{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=30}} Of her five children with Kartolo, one&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Rachmat Kartolo]]&nbsp;<U+2013> entered acting.

==Early life==
Roekiah was born in [[Bandung]], [[West Java]], [[Dutch East Indies]], in 1917 to Mohammad Ali and Ningsih, actors with the Opera Poesi Indra Bangsawan troupe;{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=4}} Ali was originally from [[Belitung]], while Ningsih was of [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] descent and came from [[Cianjur]].<ref>{{harvnb|Imanjaya|2006|p=109}}; {{harvnb|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=24}}</ref> Though Roekiah learned acting mainly from her parents, she also studied the craft with other members of their troupe.{{sfn|Berita Minggu Film 1982, Roekiah|p=V}} The trio were constantly travelling, leaving Roekiah with no time for a formal education.{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=24}} By the mid-1920s they were with another troupe, the Opera Rochani.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekiah}}

Roekiah insisted on entering the acting profession, despite the opposition of her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with the condition that Roekiah only performed once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took to the stage for the first time, Mohammad Ali&nbsp;<U+2013> unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter&nbsp;<U+2013> rushed on stage and insisted that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented.<ref>{{harvnb|Berita Buana 1996, Roekiah|pp=1, 6}}; {{harvnb|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=24}}</ref> Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe.{{sfn|Berita Minggu Film 1982, Roekiah|p=V}}

By 1932, the year she joined Palestina Opera in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (modern-day Jakarta), Roekiah had become a well-known stage actress and singer of ''[[keroncong]]'' music (traditional music with [[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|Portuguese]] influences). She was admired not only for her voice, but her beauty.<ref>{{harvnb|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=4}}; {{harvnb|van der Heide|2002|p=128}}</ref> While with Palestina she met her future husband [[Kartolo]], an actor, pianist, and songwriter with the troupe; they married when she was seventeen.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekiah}} The new couple took a month's hiatus before joining the group Faroka on a tour in Singapore, and returned to the Indies in 1936.<ref>{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=26}}</ref>

==Film career==
===Partnership with Rd Mochtar===
[[File:Siti Akbari postcard 1.jpg|thumb|alt=A promotional image showing a woman in a batik shirt sitting next to a man in a peci.|Roekiah with her frequent co-star, [[Rd Mochtar]], in ''[[Siti Akbari]]'']]
In 1937 Roekiah made her first film appearance as the leading lady in [[Albert Balink]]'s ''[[Terang Boelan]]'' (''Full Moon''). She and her co-star [[Rd Mochtar]]{{efn|''Rd'' is an abbreviation of the [[Priyayi#Titles|Javanese honorific ''Raden'']], used by the [[priyayi|nobility]].}}  played two lovers who elope so that Roekiah's character need not marry an opium smuggler;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekiah}} Kartolo also had a small role. The film was a commercial success, earning over 200,000 [[Straits dollars]] during its international release;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=171}} the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]], credited Roekiah as the "dynamite" which led to this positive reception.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=172}}

Despite the success of ''Terang Boelan'', Algemeen Nederlandsch Indisch Filmsyndicaat, the production company, stopped all work on [[fiction film]]s.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=172}} Now jobless and depressed after the death of her mother, according to journalist W. Imong, Roekiah "kept silent, constantly musing as if she were mentally disturbed".{{efn|Original: "''... soeka diam-diam, bermenoeng-menoeng sebagai seorang jang mengandoeng sakit djiwa.''"}}{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=26}} In order to distract his wife, Kartolo gathered the other cast members from ''Terang Boelan'' and established the Terang Boelan Troupe, which toured to Singapore to popular acclaim; this snapped Roekiah out of her melancholy.{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=26}} After the troupe returned to the Indies, most of the cast switched to [[Tan's Film]],{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=174}} including Roekiah and Kartolo; the two also performed with the [[Lief Java]] ''keroncong'' group.{{efn|This group provided the music for Tan's films throughout 1940 and 1941.}}{{sfn|Imong 1941, Riwajat Roekiah<U+2013>Kartolo|p=26}}

With Tan's, the ''Terang Boelan'' cast appeared in the 1938 hit ''[[Fatima (1938 film)|Fatima]]'', starring Roekiah and Rd Mochtar. The film, in which Roekiah played the title role&nbsp;<U+2013> a young woman who must fend away the advances of a gang leader while falling in love with a fisherman (Rd Mochtar)&nbsp;<U+2013> closely followed the formula established by ''Terang Boelan''.{{efn|This pattern was eventually followed by all of Roekiah's films.}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Fatima}} Roekiah's acting received wide praise. One reviewer in the Batavia-based ''Het Nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB>'' wrote that Roekiah's "sober personification of injustice in the Malay [[adat]] wedding captivates even the European spectator",{{efn|Original: "''Haar sobere verpersoonlijking van het onrecht in de Maleische huwelijks adat boeit en pakt zelfs den Europeeschen toeschouwer.''"}}{{sfn|Het Nieuws 1939, Nieuwe Films}} while another, in the ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'', found that Roekiah's performance was appreciated by everyone.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1939, Fatima}}

''Fatima'' was a massive commercial hit, earning 200,000&nbsp;gulden on a 7,000&nbsp;gulden budget.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=175}} Following the film's success, Tan's continued to cast Roekiah with Rd Mochtar.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=176}} They became the nation's first [[Supercouple|on-screen celebrity couple]] and were termed Indonesia's [[Charles Farrell]]<U+2013>[[Janet Gaynor]].{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=30}} The popularity of Roekiah<U+2013>Rd Mochtar as a screen couple led other studios to follow with their own romantic pairings. [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film, for instance, paired [[Mohamad Mochtar]] and [[Hadidjah]] in ''[[Alang-Alang (film)|Alang-Alang]]'' (''Grass'', 1939).{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=109}}

In order to keep their new star, Tan's Film spent a large amount of money. Roekiah and Kartolo received a monthly holding fee of 150 gulden and 50 gulden respectively, twice as much as they had been given for ''Terang Boelan''. They were also given a house in Tanah Rendah, Batavia.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=223}} Roekiah and Kartolo, for their part, continued to act for the company; Kartolo often had small, comedic, roles, and Roekiah sang songs her husband had written.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekiah}} In 1939 they appeared together, again with Rd Mochtar as Roekiah's romantic foil, in the [[Zorro]]-influenced ''[[Gagak Item]]''. Though not as successful as Roekiah's previous works, the film was still profitable.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=212}} A reviewer for the ''Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'' praised Roekiah's "demure" acting.{{efn|Original: "''... ingetogen ...''"}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1939, Gagak Item}}

Roekiah's last film with Rd Mochtar, ''[[Siti Akbari]]'', was released in 1940. Possibly inspired by a [[Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari|poem]] of the same name by [[Lie Kim Hok]], the film featured Roekiah in the [[title role]], portraying a long-suffering wife who remains faithful to her husband despite his infidelity.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Siti Akbari}} The film was well-received, earning 1,000 gulden on its first night in Surabaya,{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Film Sampoerna}} but was ultimately unable to return profits similar to ''Terang Boelan'' or ''Fatima''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=212}}

===Partnership with Djoemala===
[[File:Djoemala and Roekiah in Roekihati.jpg|thumb|alt=A promotional image showing a woman in a polka-dotted shirt receiving water from a man in a safari hat.|After Mochtar left [[Tan's Film]], Roekiah was paired with [[Djoemala]].]]
Amidst a wage dispute, Rd Mochtar left Tan's for their competitor Populair Films in 1940. Accordingly, the company began looking for a new on-screen partner for Roekiah.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=227}} Kartolo asked an acquaintance, a tailor-cum-entrepreneur named [[Djoemala|Ismail Djoemala]] to take the part; though Djoemala had never acted before, he had sung with the group Malay Pemoeda in 1929. After Kartolo asked him six times to act for Tan's, Djoemala agreed.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1942, Ismail Djoemala|p=8}} The company found  the tall and good-looking Djoemala a suitable replacement,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=223}} and hired him, giving him the stage name Rd Djoemala.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=249}}

Roekiah and Djoemala made their first film together, ''[[Sorga Ka Toedjoe]]'' (''Seventh Heaven''), later that year. In the film, Roekiah played a young woman who, with the help of her lover, is able to reunite her blind aunt ([[Annie Landouw]]) with her estranged husband (Kartolo).{{sfn|L.|1940|loc=n.p}} This film was a commercial success,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=224}} and the reviews were positive. One, for the ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'', opined that Djoemala was as good as, if not better, than Rd Mochtar.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1940, Sampoerna}} Another review, for the ''[[Singapore Free Press]]'', wrote that "Roekiah fills the part of the heroine in a most praiseworthy manner".{{sfn|Singapore Free Press 1941, A Malay Film}} In April of the following year Tan's released ''[[Roekihati]]'', starring Roekiah as a young woman who goes to the city to earn money for her ailing family, ultimately marrying.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekihati}} Her performance received praise from the ''Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad'', which wrote that she had performed well in the difficult role.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Roekihati}}

Later in 1941 Roekiah and Djoemala completed ''[[Poesaka Terpendam]]'' (''Buried Treasure''),{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=224}} an action-filled film which followed two groups&nbsp;<U+2013> the rightful heirs (Roekiah being one of them) and a band of criminals&nbsp;<U+2013> in a race to find treasure buried in [[Banten]].{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1941, Poesaka Terpendam}} Roekiah and Djoemala worked on their final film together, ''[[Koeda Sembrani]]'' (''The Enchanted Horse''), in early 1942. In the film, adapted from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', Roekiah took the role of Princess Shams-al-Nahar and was shown flying on a horse.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia 1942, Studio Nieuws|p=17}} The film was still incomplete when the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]] began in March 1942,{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=282}} though it was screened by October 1943.{{sfn|Pembangoen 1943, Pertoendjoekan}}

Altogether Roekiah and Djoemala acted in four films in two years. Biran argues this is evidence the company "wasted their treasure",{{efn|Original: "''... menyia-nyiakan hartanya ini.''"}} as its competitors used their stars more often; Java Industrial Film, for instance, completed six films starring Moh. Mochtar in 1941 alone.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=224}} Though Roekiah's films continued to be financial successes,{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=109}} they did not earn as large a profit as her earlier works.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=5}}

==Japanese occupation and death==
[[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|Film production in the Indies]] declined after the Japanese occupation began in early 1942; the overlords forced all but one studio to close.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=319, 332}} In their place, the Japanese opened their own studio in the Indies, Nippon Eigasha, which was tasked with producing [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|propaganda]] for the war effort.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=6}} Kartolo acted in the studio's only feature film ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Hope of the South''), without Roekiah in 1943.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kartolo}} After a hiatus of several years, Roekiah also acted the studio, taking a role in the short Japanese propaganda film ''Ke Seberang'' (''To the Other Side'') in 1944.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Roekiah}} However, much of her time was spent touring Java with a theatrical company, entertaining Japanese troops.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=7}}

Roekiah fell ill in February 1945, not long after completing ''Ke Seberang''. Despite this, and a miscarriage, she was unable to rest: the Japanese forces insisted that she and Kartolo go on tour to [[Surabaya]], in [[East Java|eastern Java]]. Upon her return to Jakarta,{{efn|Renamed at the beginning of the Japanese occupation.}} her condition became worse.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=7}} After several months of treatment, she died sometime after Indonesia [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed its independence]] on 17 August 1945.{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=34}} Roekiah was buried in Kober Hulu, [[Jatinegara]], Jakarta.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=7}} Her funeral was attended by several luminaries, including the Minister of Education [[Ki Hajar Dewantara]].{{sfn|TIM, Roekiah}}

==Family==
[[File:Roekiah and Kartolo Pertjatoeran Doenia June 1941 p8.jpg|thumb|alt=A woman and man standing; the man is a head taller.|upright|Roekiah with her husband [[Kartolo]]]]
Roekiah said that she felt Kartolo was a good match with her, stating that the marriage brought them "great fortune".{{efn|Original: "''Pernikahanku dengan Kartolo ternyata mendatangkan banyak rejeki''".}} The two had had five children.{{sfn|Berita Minggu Film 1982, Roekiah|p=V}} After Roekiah's death, Kartolo brought the children to his hometown at [[Yogyakarta]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kartolo}} In order to support the family, he took a job with [[Radio Republik Indonesia]], beginning in 1946. There he spent most of the ongoing [[Indonesian National Revolution]], an armed conflict and diplomatic struggle between newly-proclaimed Indonesia and the [[Dutch Empire]] with the goal of international recognition of Indonesia's independence. After the Dutch military launched [[Operation Kraai]] on 19 December 1948, capturing Yogyakarta, Kartolo refused to collaborate with the returning colonial forces. Without a source of income, he fell ill, and died on 18 January 1949.{{sfn|Berita Minggu Film 1982, Roekiah|p=V}}

One of the couple's children died in Yogyakarta, aged ten.{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=34}} The remaining children were brought to Jakarta after the Indonesian National Revolution ended in 1950, where they were raised by Kartolo's close friend Adikarso. One, [[Rachmat Kartolo]], went on to be a singer and actor active up through the 1970s,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kartolo}} known for songs such as "Patah Hati" ("Heartbroken") and films such as ''Matjan Kemajoran'' (''Tiger of Kemayoran''; 1965) and ''Bernafas dalam Lumpur'' (''Breathing in the Mud''; 1970).{{sfn|Berita Buana 1996, Roekiah|p=6}} Two other sons, Jusuf and Imam, played in a band with their brother before finding careers elsewhere. The couple's daughter, Sri Wahjuni, did not enter the entertainment industry.{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=34}}

==Legacy==
The press viewed Roekiah fondly, and her new releases consistently received positive reviews.{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=6}} At the peak of Roekiah's popularity, fans based their fashion decisions on what Roekiah wore on-screen.{{sfn|TIM, Roekiah}} Roekiah appeared regularly in advertisements,{{efn|This included advertisements for [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machines and Matjan-brand sandals from [[Bata Shoes|Bata]] ({{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=24}}).}} and numerous [[Gramophone record|records]] with her vocal performances were available on the market. One fan, in a 1996 interview, recalled that Roekiah was "every man's idol",{{efn|Original: "''Dulu Roekiah menjadi idola setiap pria!''"}}{{sfn|Berita Buana 1996, Roekiah|p=6}} while others christened Roekiah as Indonesia's [[Dorothy Lamour]].{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=4}} Another fan, recalling a performance he had witnessed over fifty years earlier, stated:

{{quote|text=Roekiah always left her audiences riveted to their seats when she began crooning her ''keroncong'' songs. She always got applause, before or after singing. Not only from the native [Indonesians]. Many Dutchmen diligently watched her performances!{{efn|Original: "''Roekiah selalu membuat penonton terlena di bangkunya saat ia mengalunkan lagu keroncong. Ia selalu mendapatkan tepuk tangan, sebelum atau sesudah bernyanyi. Bukan hanya kalangan pribumi. Banyak Belanda yang rajin menonton pertunjukan Roekiah!|sign=Triman|source={{harvtxt|Berita Buana 1996, Roekiah|pp=1, 6}}}}}}

After Roekiah's death, the Indonesian film industry searched for a replacement. The film scholar Ekky Imanjaya notes one instance where a film was advertised with the line "Roekiah? No! But [[Sofia W.D.|Sofia]] in a new Indonesian film, ''Air Mengalir di Tjitarum''".{{efn|Original: "''Roekiah? Bukan! Tetapi Sofia dalam pilem Indonesia baru: ''Air Mengalir di Tjitarum''.''"}}{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=111}} Roekiah's films were screened regularly,{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=111}} but most are now lost. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly-flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} Of Roekiah's <U+0153>uvre, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' only records ''Koeda Sembrani'' as being stored at Indonesia's film archive, [[Sinematek Indonesia]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Koeda Sembrani}}

Writings about Roekiah after her death often cite her as an idol of Indonesia's film industry.{{sfn|TIM, Roekiah}} Imanjaya describes her as one of the industry's first beauty icons; he also credits her and Rd Mocthar with introducing the concept of [[bankable star]]s to domestic cinema.{{sfn|Imanjaya|2006|p=109}} ''Moderna'' magazine, in 1969, wrote that "in her time [Roekiah] reached a level of popularity which, one could say, has not been seen since".{{efn|Original: "''... didalam djamannja telah mentjapai suatu popularitas jang boleh dikatakan sampai sekarang belum ada bandingnja".}}{{sfn|Moderna 1969, Miss Roekiah|p=30}} In 1977 ''Keluarga'' magazine styled her one of Indonesia's "pioneering film stars",{{efn|Original: "''... Perintis Bintang Film Indonesia...''"}}{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|p=4}} writing that hers was "a natural talent, a combination of her personality and the tenderness and beauty of her face, always filled with romance".{{efn|Original: "''Bakat permainannya dalam film adalah bakat alam yang merupakan perpaduan pribadinya dengan pancaran kelembutan keayuan wajahnya yang penuh romantik.''"}}{{sfn|Keluarga 1977, Miss Roekiah|pp=5<U+2013>6}}
