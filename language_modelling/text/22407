The '''Omagh bombing''' was a [[paramilitary]] [[car bomb]] attack carried out by the [[Real IRA]] (RIRA), a splinter group of former [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] members opposed to the [[Belfast Agreement]], on [[August 15]], [[1998]], in [[Omagh]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/151985.stm|title=Bomb Atrocity Rocks Northern Ireland|date=[[1998-08-16]]|accessdate=2007-09-11|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Twenty-nine people died as a result of the attack,<ref name="CNN"/><ref name="Times"/><ref name="Independent"/> including one woman who was pregnant with twins, and approximately 220 people were injured.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/152156.stm|title=Omagh bombing kills 28|date=[[1998-08-16]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> The attack was described by the [[BBC]] and as "Northern Ireland's worst single terrorist atrocity" and by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] as an "appalling act of savagery and evil".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/524462.stm|title=Bravery awards for bomb helpers|date=[[1999-11-17]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref><ref>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/omagh/events.htm The Omagh Bomb - Main Events]</ref> [[Sinn Fein]] leaders [[Gerry Adams]]<ref name="PBS">[http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/europe/july-dec98/troubles_8-19.html A BLAST OF EVIL].

==Chronology==
*The [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] carrying the bomb was parked outside a clothes shop on Omagh's Market Street at 14:00. It had been stolen in [[Carrickmacross]], [[County Monaghan]] a week before; it then had its [[Irish vehicle registration plates|Republic of Ireland number plates]] replaced with [[British car number plates#Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] plates.  The driver and another occupant left the car and walked down Campsie Road.
*At 14:32 the first warning was received by an employee of [[UTV]] in [[Belfast]]. After passing the information to the RUC, the employee received another warning one minute later. Another minute later a warning was given to the Coleraine office of the [[Samaritans]].
*At 15:10 the bomb detonated.

==Warnings==
On the day of the bombing, three warnings were recorded and reported:

Received by Ulster Television at 14:32
:''"There's a bomb, courthouse, Omagh, main street, 500 pounds, explosion 30 minutes."'' 

Received by [[Ulster Television]] at 14:33
:''"Bomb, Omagh town, 15 minutes."''

Received by the [[Coleraine]] office of the '[[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]]' charity at 14:34
:''"Am I through to Omagh? This is a bomb warning. It's going to go off in 30 minutes."'' The caller then stated the bomb was placed on Main Street, {{convert|200|yd|m|-2}} from the courthouse.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/latest_news/153818.stm ''Omagh bomb warnings released'', BBC News]</ref>

There has been considerable debate about the subject of these warnings; the tapes of some warnings have not been released to the public, and some information about the location of the bomb may have been recorded incorrectly or ignored. One warning mentioned that the bomb was {{convert|200|yd|m|-2}} away from the courthouse, the actual bombing was between 300-400 yards from the Courthouse.

==Responsibility==
After the attack the Real IRA claimed responsibility and apologised for bombing the courthouse at Omagh<ref name="apology">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/northern_ireland/focus/153629.stm ''Real IRA apologises for Omagh bomb'']. [[BBC]]. Published August 18, 1998.</ref> and on [[14 December]] [[2001]] released a statement claiming the organisation had "minimal involvement" and that two [[MI5]] agents were largely responsible for the bombing.<ref>[http://irelandsown.net/rira1.html 14 December 2001 Real IRA Statement in Full]</ref>

The [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme, ''Who Bombed Omagh?'', shown in 2000, gave the names of the prime suspects as [[S<U+00E9>amus McKenna]], [[Michael McKevitt]], [[Liam Campbell]], [[Colm Murphy]], and [[Seamus Daly]]. Police believe that the [[4 March 2001 BBC bombing|bombing of BBC Television Centre]] in [[London]] was a revenge attack for the broadcast.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010804/ai_n14403426 ''Ealing Bomb: The Real IRA''], ''Independent 4 August, 2001</ref>

Builder and [[Public house|publican]] Colm Murphy, from [[County Louth]], was charged and convicted in 2001 by the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic's]] [[Special Criminal Court]] for "conspiracy to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause injury". He was sentenced to fourteen years. In January 2005, Murphy's conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered by the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], on the grounds that two [[An Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na|Garda<U+00ED>]] had falsified interview notes, and that Murphy's previous convictions were improperly taken into account by the trial judges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0121/omagh.html|title=Relatives disappointed with Omagh ruling|date=[[2005-01-21]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[RT<U+00C9> News]]}}</ref>

Many of the others were later sued in a civil action by the relatives of people killed in the bombing, including the families of James Barker, 12, Samantha McFarland, 17, Lorraine Wilson, 15, and 20-month-old Breda Devine.

On [[September 6]], [[2006]] Sean Hoey, an electrician from [[Jonesborough, County Armagh|Jonesborough]], [[County Armagh]] went on trial accused of 29 counts of murder, as well as terrorism and explosives charges.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,,1865911,00.html | title=Sickness halts Omagh trial | date=[[2006-09-06]] | accessdate=2007-03-14 | work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Hoey's trial has been completed and, on [[20 December]] [[2007]], he was found not guilty of all 56 charges against him.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7154221.stm | title=Man not guilty of Omagh murders | date=[[2007-12-20]] | accessdate=2007-12-20 | work=[[BBC News Online]] }}</ref>

==Police Ombudsman report==
The [[Police Ombudsman]], [[Nuala O'Loan]], strongly criticised the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC, now the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) over their handling of the investigation. Her report stated that RUC officers had ignored previous warnings about a bomb and had failed to act on crucial intelligence. She went on to say that officers had been uncooperative and defensive during her inquiry into the investigation. RUC officers had been seen moving people towards the bomb, which they claimed was because the warnings had been for the Courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/ombudsman/po121201omagh1.pdf|title=Statement by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland on her Investigation of matters relating to the Omagh Bomb on August 15, 1998|date=[[2001-12-12]]|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> On [[24 February]], [[2006]], it was alleged that an agent paid by [[MI5]] and the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], knew of the plan to bomb Omagh, but that MI5 never passed this information to police.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0224/omagh.html|title=MI5 withheld intelligence ahead of Omagh|date=[[2006-02-24]]|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=[[RT<U+00C9> News]]}}</ref> In 2006 Hugh Orde stated that the senior officer in charge of the case believed that MI5 did not withhold information.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4763714.stm ''MI5 "did not retain Omagh advice"''] BBC News</ref>

''The Mirro''r report that initially, the Police Association, which represents senior officers and rank and file members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), went to court to try to block the release of the O'Loan report, but dropped their efforts after being given more time to review the report before its release to the public.  

However Chief Constable [[Ronnie Flanagan]] stated that the multiple warnings were given to cause confusion and ultimately a greater loss of life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/omagh/police_press_releases.html|title=Appendix B: Police Press Releases on the Omagh Bomb|first=Wesley|last=Johnston|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref>

==Victims' support group==
The families of the victims of the bomb created the Omagh Support and Self Help Group after the bombing.  Their website provides newsletters, references and news archives regarding the bombing.  The group also provides support to victims of other bombings in Ireland, as well other terrorist bombings, such as the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]].<ref>[http://www.omaghbomb.co.uk/ Omagh Support and Self Help Group]</ref>

==Memorials==
The bombing inspired the song "Paper Sun", by rock group [[Def Leppard]], as noted in the commentary of their album ''Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection''.

Another song inspired by the bombings was "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]", by rock group [[U2]], and includes the line "They're reading names out over the radio. All the folks the rest of us won't get to know. Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann, and Breda." The 5 names mentioned are five of the victims from this attack. Another Line, "She never got to say goodbye, To see the colour in his eyes, now he's in the dirt", was about how James Barker, a victim, was remembered by his mother Donna Maria Barker in an article in the ''[[Irish Times]]'' after the bombing in Omagh.

Omagh maintains a memorial garden in the town centre, however, a memorial stone is still to be erected.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6130850.stm BBC News]</ref>
