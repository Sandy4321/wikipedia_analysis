'''''When God Writes Your Love Story: The Ultimate Approach to Guy/Girl Relationships''''' is a 1999 book by [[Eric Ludy|Eric]] and [[Leslie Ludy]]. It became a [[bestseller]] on the Christian book market, leading to it being republished in 2004 and then being revised and expanded in 2009. The book tells the story of how the couple first met and got married. In the book, the authors challenge singles not to have [[premarital sex]], but to prepare themselves emotionally for the spouse that [[Will of God|God has planned]] for them. The first publication of the book contained a [[CD single]] of "Faithfully", a song that the Ludys wrote specifically to accompany the book.

The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. The chapters alternate between the perspectives of Eric and Leslie, with Eric writing nine chapters and Leslie writing seven in addition to the introduction. The Ludys argue that God should be in charge of one's love life and that pursuing a [[Personal_god#Christianity|relationship with God]] is more important than pursuing a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship with another human being]]. Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving [[Physical intimacy|physical]] and/or [[emotional intimacy]] result in long-term [[psychological pain]] and that one should therefore only be physically and emotionally intimate with one's spouse.

''When God Writes Your Love Story'' has received positive reviews from other American authors, such as [[Mark Matlock]], [[Jason Evert]], and [[Christine Gardner]], as well as from [[Filipino people|Filipina]] [[Actor|actresses]], such as [[Rachelle Ann Go]] and [[Anne Curtis]]. Margaret and Dwight Peterson, two college professors that teach a course together which is called "Christian Marriage", responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story" in which they argue that the Ludys' book makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy results in disappointment.

In ''Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church'', Christine A. Col<U+00F3>n and Bonnie E. Field compare ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to [[Derek Prince]]'s ''God Is a Matchmaker'' and favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate. While the Ludys' book states that it is worth waiting because the wait indicates a better prize, Prince advocates waiting because it [[Test (assessment)|tests]] one's [[faith]].

[[File:Ulysses and the Sirens by H.J. Draper.jpg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A painting of six men in a boat, four of whom are rowing and the fifth of whom is tying the sixth to the mast, and three sirens climbing the hull|Near the beginning of the book, [[Eric Ludy]] retells the portion of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in which [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] sailed near the land of the [[Siren]]s; Eric uses the story to illustrate his assertion that resisting premarital sexual and romantic temptations is often torturous if one is not listening to the "sweeter song" of God's plans.]]

The book is divided into five sections and sixteen chapters. The chapters alternate between the perspectives of Eric and Leslie, with Eric writing nine chapters and Leslie writing seven in addition to the introduction. Near the beginning of the book, Eric retells the portion of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in which [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] sailed near the land of the [[Siren]]s whose song normally attracted sailors so strongly that ships would sail towards the land and crash on the rocks. In this story, Ulysses orders all his men to fill their ears with [[beeswax]] and then tie him to the mast; the ship therefore sails through the area unharmed. Still, Ulysses, hearing the Sirens' song the entire time, is tortured by its beauty and his inability to get to the song's source.

Eric follows this story with a retelling of the story of [[Orpheus]]'s encounter with the Sirens. In this story, Orpheus's solution is to play a "sweeter song" than that of the Sirens; his ship also passes through the area unharmed because all of his men are so entranced by his song that they don't even notice the Sirens. Eric then [[Argument from analogy|argues from analogy]] that, normally, those who force themselves to resist premarital sexual and romantic temptations are likely to find the process torturous (like Ulysses), while those who listen to the plans God has for them find waiting for [[marriage]] much easier (as it was for Orpheus's crew). This concept of listening to the "sweeter song" is a concept that is expanded upon and often referred to throughout the rest of the book. Another frequently mentioned concept in the book is "the beautiful side of love", which the Ludys describe as the positive aspects of [[Romance (love)|romance]].

The Ludys argue that God should be in charge of one's love life and that pursuing a [[Personal_god#Christianity|relationship with God]] is more important than pursuing a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship with another human being]]. They suggest that, "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then ''that person you will one day marry''... is alive and wandering the earth" and that this knowledge should encourage people to act in such a way that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of "true love" as an emotion; instead, they define "true love" as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that "there are two ways that each of us can approach life. Spending our days meeting our needs, or looking for ways to meet other's needs. The mystery is that when we spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well."

Leslie argues that non-permanent relationships involving [[Physical intimacy|physical]] and/or [[emotional intimacy]] result in long-term [[psychological pain]] and that one should therefore only become physically or emotionally intimate with one's spouse. Eric retells the [[Greek myths|Greek myth]] of the [[suitors of Penelope]], in which [[Penelope]], whose husband Ulysses is erroneously believed to be dead, resists a large number of [[marriage proposal]]s until Ulysses returns and slays the suitors; Eric uses the story to suggest that one should be faithful to one's future spouse even if it appears that they will never arrive. Eric argues that [[selfless service]] is an important part of marriage. He therefore suggests that a good way for a man to make himself ready for his future spouse is to serve his mother and sisters, and that single women should practice serving their fathers and brothers. Leslie writes that, in order to make good relationship decisions, it is important to have a "team... made up of godly people who can keep us accountable to our commitments, pray with us, and provide a refreshing outside perspective" on one's love life. She indicates that this team should include one's parents or, if one does not have living Christian parents, other Christians of an older generation. She writes that God offers new beginnings to people who have been [[Chastity|unchaste]] or who have been [[Sexual abuse|sexually abused]].

==Critical response==
[[File:Leslie Ludy.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photograph of a smiling woman wearing red lipstick, a white necklace, a white shirt, and a green sweater looking at the viewer|[[Leslie Ludy]] ''(pictured)'' was commended by [[Jason Evert]] for writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships.]]

In ''Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom'', [[Mark Matlock]] recommends ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to college students seeking wisdom. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom|author=Mark Matlock|year=2005|location=[[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]|publisher=[[The Navigators (organization)|NavPress]]|page=166|isbn=1576837297}}</ref> [[Jason Evert]] wrote positively of ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in his book ''If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity''. Evert commends Leslie Ludy for writing about the importance of listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships.<ref>Evert (2003), p. 45.</ref> Evert praises a passage from ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of guys who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. Evert agrees with these men and uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.<ref>Evert (2003), pp. 59-60.</ref> Leah Andrews of the ''Lewiston Morning Tribune'' compared the ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to [[Joshua Harris]]'s ''[[I Kissed Dating Goodbye]]'' and ''[[Boy Meets Girl: Say Hello to Courtship|Boy Meets Girl]]'', all three being popular Christian books providing alternatives to dating.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Lewiston Morning Tribune|title=Relearning the dating game|author=Leah Andrews|date=March 31, 2002|page=1C}}</ref>

Kali Schiska of ''The Pine Log'' suggests that there are people who are not [[Christian]]s "may think the idea of the book is completely heinous." Still, Schiska believes that one of the illustrations in one of Leslie's chapters is worth consideration by Christians and non-Christians alike; the illustration is of a person's heart being a precious pearl that gets more tarnished and broken with every failed [[intimate relationship]] to the point that, when the person gets married, the pearl he or she is left to give his or her spouse is now a poor gift.<ref name=Pine/> In 2005, [[Louisiana Tech University]] [[Journalism school|journalism major]] Amber Miles wrote an article published by ''[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]]'' called "Unmarried and graduating from college - and that's OK" in which she stated that she was reading ''When God Writes Your Love Story''. She quotes [[The National Marriage Project]] as finding that only 42% of young adult singles believe that adhering to the same religion as one's spouse is important. She states that her reading of the Ludys' book affirmed in her that she should be part of that 42%.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[The Times (Shreveport)|The Times]]|title=Unmarried and graduating from college - and that's OK|author=Amber Miles|date=February 25, 2005|page=15A}}</ref>

Rick Holland of [[Crosswalk.com]] criticizes the Ludys for basing too much of their description of [[dating]] on [[anecdote]]s and not enough on the [[Bible]]. Nonetheless, he commends the couple on the relevant [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] they do quote and he argues that the advice the Ludys share in the book is sound and that their story is an encouraging one.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Crosswalk.com]]|author=Rick Holland|title=Defining Your Dating Style: The Guided Path <U+2013> Part I|date=August 31, 2005|url=http://www.crosswalk.com/family/singles/defining-your-dating-style-the-guided-path-<U+2013>-part-i-1348736.html?ps=0|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> In ''[[Making Chastity Sexy|Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns]]'', [[Christine Gardner]] writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and "desperately wanted God to write her love story, but she thought that she would help him out by filling in the blanks." Gardner argues that the result of this woman's failure to follow the Ludys' advice and leave God to write her love story "was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending."<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Making Chastity Sexy|Making Chastity Sexy: The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns]]|author=Christine J.

[[Rachelle Ann Go]] of the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' received a copy of the Ludys' book from [[Christian Bautista]], her ex-boyfriend. The book caused her to cry.

In 2012, [[Grayson County, Kentucky|Grayson County]], [[Kentucky]], Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center offered a course on the topic of sexual [[integrity]] that employed ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' and two other [[Christian literature|Christian books]] as its basis, the other two being [[Gary Chapman (author)|Gary Chapman]]'s ''[[The Five Love Languages]]'' and Bill and Pam Farrel's ''[[Men Are Like Waffles <U+2014> Women Are Like Spaghetti|Single Men Are Like Waffles <U+2014> Single Women Are Like Spaghetti]]''. The center's director, Nicole Higdon, stated that she liked the juxtaposition of male and female perspectives on fulfilling romantic relationships in the Ludys' book.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=[[Grayson County News Gazette]]|author=Rebecca Morris|title=Courses offered on male/female relationships|date=July 16, 2012|url=http://www.gcnewsgazette.com/view/full_story/19332366/article-Courses-offered-on-male-female-relationships?instance=commented|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref>

Margaret and Dwight Peterson, two college professors who teach a course together called "Christian Marriage",<ref>Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 83.</ref> responded to the Ludys' book by writing an essay called "God Does Not Want to Write Your Love Story." In this essay, they write that, while reading ''When God Writes Your Love Story'', "it began to dawn on us with particular clarity how different these stories of romance are from any traditionally Christian understanding of marriage."<ref name=Peterson84/> In response to Leslie Ludy's recommendation that a single woman should seek to be God's princess until becoming the princess of a human prince, the Petersons argue that this analogy makes young people see marriage as a fantasy comparable to that of [[Disney Princess]]es, and that this fantasy results in disappointment.<ref>Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 94.</ref> While referencing ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' specifically on several occasions, the Petersons acknowledge that the Ludys' book is one of many books with this premise and write that "it is the entire genre that is problematic."<ref name=Peterson84>Peterson and Peterson (2009), p. 84.</ref>

The Petersons criticize the song "Faithfully" that accompanied the book, arguing that its lyrics suggest that singles should seek a kind of perfection in their future marriage and spouse that is not achievable.<ref>Peterson and Peterson (2009), pp. 91-93.</ref> In ''Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity'', Brienne Murk identifies "Faithfully" as one of her favourite songs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Eyes Wide Open: Avoiding the Heartbreak of Emotional Promiscuity|author=Brienne Murk|page=121|publisher=Gospel Light Publications|year=2011|isbn=0830748431}}</ref>

In ''Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church'', Christine A. Col<U+00F3>n and Bonnie E. Field criticize Leslie Ludy's account of her own wait for God to bring her a romantic partner. Colon and Field argue that "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colon and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Cymbeline]]'', which states "the more delay'd, delighted."<ref name=Singled/> ''Singled Out'' suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.<ref name=Singled/>

Colon and Field compare ''When God Writes Your Love Story'' to [[Derek Prince]]'s ''God Is a Matchmaker'' and argue that Prince's book better expresses the concept that God allows some people to receive their [[soulmate]]s without any wait, while God requires other people to undergo a long wait. While the Ludys' book suggests that it is worth waiting for a soulmate because the wait indicates a better prize, Colon and Field favour Prince's reasons for advocating waiting for one's soulmate, which are that waiting [[Test (assessment)|tests]] one's [[faith]] and that "God has required many of His choicest servants to wait long periods for the fulfillment of His promise or purpose."<ref name=Singled>{{Cite book|title=Singled Out: Why Celibacy Must Be Reinvented in Today's Church|author=Christine A.
