'''Peru''' ({{lang-es|Per<U+00FA>}}, {{lang-qu|Piruw}}, {{lang-ay|Piruw}}), officially the '''Republic of Peru''' ({{Audio-es|Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>|Es - Rep<U+00FA>blica del Per<U+00FA>.ogg}}, {{IPA2|re'pu.<U+03B2>li.ka del pe'<U+027E>u}}), is a country in western [[South America]]. It is bordered on the north by Ecuador and Colombia, on the east by Brazil, on the southeast by Bolivia, on the south by Chile, and on the west by the Pacific Ocean.

Peruvian territory was home to the [[Norte Chico civilization]], one of the oldest in the world, and to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest state in [[Pre-Columbian|Pre-Columbian America]]. The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the country in the 16th century and established a [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty]], which included most of its South American colonies. After achieving [[Independence of Peru|independence]] in 1821, Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and fiscal crisis as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.

Peru is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] divided into [[Administrative divisions of Peru|25 regions]]. Its geography varies from the arid plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the [[Andes]] mountains and the tropical forests of the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is a [[developing country]] with a medium [[Human Development Index]] score and a poverty level around 50%. Its main economic activities include agriculture, fishing, mining, and manufacturing of products such as textiles.

The Peruvian population, estimated at 28 million, is [[multiethnic society|multiethnic]], including [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|Amerindians]], [[Black people|Africans]] and [[Spanish people|Spaniards]]. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua and other [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages]]. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.

==Etymology==
The word ''Peru'' is derived from ''Bir<U+00FA>'', the name of a local ruler who lived near the [[Bay of San Miguel]], [[Panama]], in the early 16th century.<ref>Ra<U+00FA>l Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del Per<U+00FA>'', p. 83.</ref> When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522, they were the southernmost part of the New World yet known to Europeans.<ref>Ra<U+00FA>l Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del Per<U+00FA>'', p. 84.</ref> Thus, when [[Francisco Pizarro]] explored the regions farther south, they came to be designated Bir<U+00FA> or Peru.<ref>Ra<U+00FA>l Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del Per<U+00FA>'', p. 86.</ref> The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]] gave the name legal status with the 1529 ''[[Francisco Pizarro#Capitulaci<U+00F3>n de Toledo|Capitulaci<U+00F3>n de Toledo]]'', which designated the newly encountered [[Inca Empire]] as the province of Peru.<ref>Ra<U+00FA>l Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del Per<U+00FA>'', p. 87.</ref> Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which became Republic of Peru after [[Peruvian War of Independence|independence]].

==History==
{{main|History of Peru}}
The earliest evidence of human presence in Peruvian territory has been dated to approximately 11,000 years [[Common Era|BCE]].<ref>Tom Dillehay et al, "The first settlers", p. 20.</ref> The oldest known complex society in Peru, the [[Norte Chico civilization]], flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3000 and 1800 BCE.<ref>Jonathan Haas et al, "Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru", p. 1021.</ref> These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures such as [[Chav<U+00ED>n culture|Chavin]], [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Mochica Culture|Mochica]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Huari Culture|Wari]], and [[Chim<U+00FA> culture|Chimu]]. In the 15th century, the [[Incas]] emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the largest empire in [[pre-Columbian America]].<ref>Terence D'Altroy, ''The Incas'', pp. 2&ndash;3.</ref> Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as [[irrigation]] and [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]]; [[camelid]] husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] because these societies had no notion of [[market]] or money.<ref>Enrique Mayer, ''The articulated peasant'', pp. 47&ndash;68.</ref>

[[Image:Peru Machu Picchu Sunrise 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Machu Picchu]], the "Lost City of the Incas"]]
In 1532, a group of ''[[conquistador]]s'' led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|defeated]] Inca Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and established Spanish rule. Ten years later, the Spanish Crown established the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which included most of its South American colonies.<ref>''Recopilaci<U+00F3>n de leyes de los Reynos de las Indias'', vol. II, pp. 12&ndash;13.</ref> Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] reorganized the country in the 1570s with silver mining as its main economic activity and [[Amerindian|Indian]] [[Mita (Inca)|forced labor]] as its primary workforce.<ref>Peter Bakewell, ''Miners of the Red Mountain'', p. 181.</ref> Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines.<ref>Margarita Su<U+00E1>rez, ''Desaf<U+00ED>os transatl<U+00E1>nticos'', pp. 252&ndash;253.</ref> However, by the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income.<ref>Kenneth Andrien, ''Crisis and decline'', pp. 200&ndash;202.</ref> In response, the Crown enacted the [[Bourbon Reforms]], a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty of Peru.<ref>Mark Burkholder, ''From impotence to authority'', pp. 83&ndash;87.</ref> The new laws provoked [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru II]]'s rebellion and other revolts, all of which were defeated.<ref>Scarlett O'Phelan, ''Rebellions and revolts in eighteenth century Peru and Upper Peru'', p. 276.</ref>

[[Image:San martin independence.jpg|thumb|right|Independence was proclaimed by [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] in 1821.]]
In the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by [[South American wars of independence|wars of independence]], Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, [[independence of Peru|independence]] was achieved only after the military campaigns of [[Jos<U+00E9> de San Mart<U+00ED>n]] and [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var]].<ref>Timothy Anna, ''The fall of the royal government in Peru'', pp. 237&ndash;238.</ref> During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.<ref>Charles Walker, ''Smoldering ashes'', pp. 124&ndash;125.</ref> National identity was forged during this period, as [[Sim<U+00F3>n Bol<U+00ED>var|Bolivarian]] projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] foundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Paul Gootenberg, ''Between silver and guano'', p. 12.</ref> Between the 1840s and 1860s, Peru enjoyed stability under the presidency of [[Ram<U+00F3>n Castilla]] due to increased state revenues from [[guano]] exports.<ref>Paul Gootenberg, ''Imagining development'', pp. 5&ndash;6.</ref> However, by the 1870s, these resources had been squandered, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.<ref>Paul Gootenberg, ''Imagining development'', p. 9.</ref>

Peru was defeated by Chile in the 1879&ndash;1883 [[War of the Pacific]], losing the provinces of [[Arica Province|Arica]] and [[Tarapac<U+00E1> Region|Tarapac<U+00E1>]] in the treaties of [[Treaty of Anc<U+00F3>n|Anc<U+00F3>n]] and [[Treaty of Lima|Lima]]. Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. Legu<U+00ED>a]].<ref>Ulrich M<U+00FC>cke, ''Political culture in nineteenth-century Peru'', pp. 193&ndash;194.</ref> The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Legu<U+00ED>a, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).<ref>Peter Klar<U+00E9>n, ''Peru'', pp. 262&ndash;276.</ref> The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades.<ref>David Palmer, ''Peru: the authoritarian tradition'', p. 93.</ref>

[[Image:Angamos.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Angamos|Angamos]], a decisive battle during the War of the Pacific.]]
In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against president [[Fernando Bela<U+00FA>nde Terry|Fernando Belaunde]]. The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development but failed to gain widespread support.<ref>George Philip, ''The rise and fall of the Peruvian military radicals'', pp. 163&ndash;165.</ref> In 1975, Velasco was forcefully replaced as president by General [[Francisco Morales Berm<U+00FA>dez]], who paralyzed reforms and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.<ref>Daniel Schydlowsky and Juan Julio Wicht, "Anatomy of an economic failure", pp. 106&ndash;107.</ref> During the 1980s, Peru faced a considerable external debt, ever-growing inflation, a surge in drug trafficking, and [[Internal conflict in Peru|massive political violence]].<ref>Peter Klar<U+00E9>n, ''Peru'', pp. 406&ndash;407.</ref> Under the presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990<U+2013>2000), the country started to recover, however, accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial [[Peruvian general election, 2000|2000 elections]].<ref>BBC News, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1031752.stm Fujimori: Decline and fall]''.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Peru}}
[[Image:Map of Peru Demis.png|thumb|right|Topographic map of Peru]]
Peru covers 1,285,220&nbsp;[[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (496,193&nbsp;[[square miles|mi<U+00B2>]]), making it approximately two-thirds the size of Mexico. It neighbors Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. 

The [[Andes]] mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean, dividing the country into three geographic regions. The ''costa'' (coast), to the west, is a narrow plain, largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers. The ''sierra'' (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the ''[[Altiplano]]'' plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the 6,768&nbsp;m (22,205&nbsp;ft) [[Huascar<U+00E1>n]].<ref>AndesHandbook, [http://www.andeshandbook.cl/eng/default.asp?main=cerro.asp?codigo=54 ''Huascar<U+00E1>n'']. Retrieved on [[August 12]], [[2007]].</ref> The third region is the ''selva'' (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the [[Amazon rainforest]] that extends east. Almost 60% of the country's area is located within this region.<ref>Instituto de Estudios Hist<U+00F3>rico&ndash;Mar<U+00ED>timos del Per<U+00FA>, ''El Per<U+00FA> y sus recursos: Atlas geogr<U+00E1>fico y econ<U+00F3>mico'', p. 16.</ref>

Most Peruvian rivers originate in the Andes and drain into one of three [[drainage basin|basins]]. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the [[Amazon River]] are longer, have a much larger flow, and are less steep once they exit the ''sierra''. Rivers that drain into [[Lake Titicaca]] are generally short and have a large flow.<ref>Instituto de Estudios Hist<U+00F3>rico&ndash;Mar<U+00ED>timos del Per<U+00FA>, ''El Per<U+00FA> y sus recursos: Atlas geogr<U+00E1>fico y econ<U+00F3>mico'', p. 31.</ref> Peru's longest rivers are the [[Ucayali]], the [[Mara<U+00F1><U+00F3>n River (Peru)|Mara<U+00F1><U+00F3>n]], the [[I<U+00E7><U+00E1>|Putumayo]], the [[Yavar<U+00ED> River|Yavar<U+00ED>]], the [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]], the [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]], the [[Mantaro River|Mantaro]], and the [[Amazon River|Amazon]].<ref>Instituto Nacional de Estad<U+00ED>stica e Inform<U+00E1>tica, ''Per<U+00FA>: Compendio Estad<U+00ED>stico 2005'', p. 21.</ref>

Peru is a [[multiethnic society|multiethnic nation]] formed by the combination of different groups over five centuries. [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]] in the 16th century; infectious diseases, famine, war and exploitation decreased their population from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520&ndash;1620'', p. 114.</ref> Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples.

[[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]].

[[Baroque]] art dominated in colonial times, though it was modified by native traditions.<ref>Gauvin Alexander Bailey, ''Art of colonial Latin America'', pp. 72&ndash;74.</ref> During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cuzco School]] are representative.<ref>Gauvin Alexander Bailey, ''Art of colonial Latin America'', p. 263.</ref> Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.<ref>Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Latin American art of the 20th century'', pp. 76&ndash;77, 145&ndash;146.</ref> Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.<ref>Dami<U+00E1>n Bay<U+00F3>n, "Art, c. 1920&ndash;c. 1980", pp. 425&ndash;428.</ref>

[[Peruvian literature]] has its roots in the oral traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century, and colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]].
