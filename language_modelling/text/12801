[[Image:Frottage2.jpg|thumb|upright|Artist's rendering of two men frotting.]]
'''Frot''' is a slang term derived from [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]] (ult. from the French verb ''frotter'', "to rub") describing a form of [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] male/male sex that usually but not always involves direct [[penis]]-to-penis contact.

The term "frot" was originally popularized by [[gay]] male activists who disparaged the practice of [[anal sex]]. The term evolved to encompass a variety of preferences for the act, which may or may not imply particular attitudes towards other [[Human sexual activities|sexual activities]].

Owing to its non-penetrative character, frot has the [[safe sex]] advantage of minimizing the transmission risk for [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]],<ref>http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/prevention/reduce-your-risk/sexual-risk-factors/</ref> and may also help to lower the risk of certain other [[sexually transmitted infections]], without the inconvenience of purchasing condoms and condom-safe lubricants.

==Concept and etymology==
Genito-genital sex or genital-genital (GG) sex is a physically descriptive term for sex in which there is contact between the genitals, in the same naming convention as "genital-anal sex" and "genital-oral sex".<ref>{{cite web

As a modern concept that describes a specific activity among [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), the term "frot" emerged in a context of a debate about the status of anal sex within the gay male community; some in the anti-anal, pro-frot camp insist that anal sex ought to be avoided altogether.<ref name="Advocate.com">{{cite news|title=The New Sex Police|publisher=''[[The Advocate]]''|date=2005-04-12|accessdate=2011-02-12|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mGMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39&dq=&hl=en&ei=P55WTZv8BILagAffxOz9DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref> Another view argued that the popularity of anal sex would decline (presumably with a corresponding drop in HIV rates) if gay men could somehow be persuaded to stop thinking of anal sex as a "[[Vanilla sex|vanilla]]" practice, but rather as something "kinky" and not-quite-respectable<U+2014>as was the case in the 1950s and 1960s, when homosexual men who preferred to do only mutual masturbation and fellatio sometimes used the mildly disparaging slang term "brownie queen" for aficionados of anal sex., "The 1950s and early 1960s were big on oral sex. People who invited anal sex were called by a pejorative name, 'brownie queens'. ...

Before ''frot'' came into use as a specific term for this act, the available alternatives included ''frictation'' (though ''fricate'' can refer to any genital friction, including frottage, coitus and masturbation), and ''frontism''. Frot was at some point shortened from the term "[[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]]" (rhyming with "massage"), a more generic and unisex term for various types of non-penetrative genital rubbing.

While it is possible that ''frottage'' in the unisex sense of "non-penetrative sexual rubbing" was casually shortened to ''frot'' by many anonymous individuals over the years, gay activist Bill Weintraub began to heavily promote and recommend the gender-specific meaning of "penis-to-penis rubbing" on Internet forums sometime in the late 1990s. On the basis of this, Weintraub has said that he coined the term ''frot''. "I don't use the word 'frottage,' because it is an ersatz French word which can indicate any sort of erotic rubbing," he stated. "Frot, by contrast, is always phallus-to-phallus sex." Weintraub believes that is what actual sexual intimacy is <U+2013> genital-genital contact.<ref name="Piepenburg">{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's Rub Got to Do With it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=2011-02-18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=frot+weintraub+definition&source=bl&ots=MxxUDUmE_Q&sig=Fc6AB7cAZsosN46JFvJCT2Ebe70&hl=en&ei=wL1ZTaHxH4bbgQfQ2pDLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=frot%20weintraub%20definition&f=false}}</ref>

===Synonyms===
Slang terms for frot include "cock rub," "bumping dicks," "knocking cocks," "tummy stix," "sword-fighting", "Oxford style", "Princeton rub", and "Ivy League rub".<ref name="Piepenburg">{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Piepenburg|title=What's Rub Got to Do With it?|publisher=''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]''|date=February 2006|accessdate=2011-02-18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=M2IEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=frot+weintraub+definition&source=bl&ots=MxxUDUmE_Q&sig=Fc6AB7cAZsosN46JFvJCT2Ebe70&hl=en&ei=wL1ZTaHxH4bbgQfQ2pDLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=frot%20weintraub%20definition&f=false}}</ref>On the Internet, the slang term "g0y" (spelled with the numeral zero) is sometimes used to describe a man who has sex with men but tends to abstain from anal sex and has a preference for frot.

==Sexual practices==
===General===
Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary opening]] (meatus) of the penis [[glans penis|head]] (glans penis). The lesbian form is referred to as [[tribadism]], a term derived from the Greek word for "rub" and that was historically used interchangeably with ''lesbian''.<ref>[http://archives.xtra.ca/Story.aspx?s=31148 archives.xtra.ca]</ref> According to this way of looking at things, penetration, including anal penetration, is "male-defined" sexuality.<ref>[http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2007/10/sexual_healing_1 www.thefword.org.uk]</ref>

Similarly, the term "frictation" can refer to the wider meaning of "frottage"<ref>

Partly because the word "frottage" was potentially ambiguous as a descriptive term for various permutations of ''[[non-penetrative sex]]'' in male/female and female/female contexts, and partly because frottage was sometimes stigmatized as "only foreplay" or "a substitute for the real thing", some MSM writers began using and recommending the shortened form "frot" with the specifically intended meaning of penis-to-penis sex as a favorite or even preferred act. That is, the short form carried implicit encouragement for men who had sex with men to "choose frot".

===Safe sex===

Since frot is a non-penetrative [[sex act]], the risk of passing a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) that requires direct contact between the [[mucous membranes]] and [[pre-ejaculate]] or [[semen]] is reduced. Notably, [[HIV]] is among the diseases that require such direct contact, and is therefore very unlikely (but possible) to be transmitted via frot.<ref>

===Debates===
There is some debate in the gay male community, and among MSM in general, regarding what constitutes "real sex" or the most sensual expression of sexual intimacy. Some frot advocates view "two genitals coming together by
mingling, caressing, sliding" and rubbing as "sex" more than other forms of
bodily pleasuring.<ref name="Perez"/><ref name="out.com"/><ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/> Others associate male masculinity with the sexual positions of "tops" and "bottoms" during anal sex,<ref name="Harvey, Wenzel, and Sprecher">{{cite book | author =John H. Harvey, Amy Wenzel, Susan Sprecher|title =The handbook of sexuality in close relationships|isbn = 0805845488,9780805845488|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|pages=686|accessdate=2011-03-12|url=http://books.google.com/?id=tZdkGTjkAZMC&pg=PA356&dq=en#v=onepage&q=Gay%20men%20who%20prefer%20anal%20sex&f=false}}</ref> with some frot advocates insisting that it introduces inequality during sexual intimacy, and that frottage is "equal" because of mutual genital-genital stimulation.<ref name="out.com"/><ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/> This view of dominance and inequality associated with sex roles is disputed by researchers, who state that it is not clear that specific sexual acts are necessarily indicative of general patterns of masculinity or dominance in a gay male relationship, and that, for both partners, anal intercourse can be associated with being masculine.<ref name="Harvey, Wenzel, and Sprecher"/>

Additionally, some frot advocates, such as Weintraub, are concerned with diseases that may be acquired through anal sex.<ref name=Advocate.com/><ref name=gaytoday.badpuppy.com/><ref name="out.com"/><ref name=Perez/><ref name="Green">{{cite book | author =Edward C.

"It's truly unfortunate that some folks perceived [me] to be antigay when nothing could be more pro-gay than keeping gay and bisexual men alive and healthy," he stated.<ref name=Advocate.com/> 

The view that anal sex is something that should be discouraged is not supported by all frot supporters. Author Joe Perez states that Weintraub and his followers have "gone overboard" in their enthusiasm for frot by claiming that supporting frot means disowning anal sex or that the latter is "inherently degrading, unnatural, or disease-spreading." He says Weintraub and his supporters' views should be taken "with a grain of salt if you can" and that he hopes for more inclusive frot communities.<ref name="Perez"/>     

Gay men who defend the essential validity of anal sex have rejected most of the claims made by radical frot advocates. Others have at times disparaged frottage as a makeshift, second-rate form of male/male intimacy <U+2014> something better left to inexperienced teenagers and "closeted" older men.<ref name="Piepenburg"/> Odets said, "No one would propose that we initiate a public health measure by de-eroticizing vaginal sex. It would sound like a ridiculous idea. It's no less ridiculous for gay men."<ref name=Advocate.com/>

==Occurrence among male bonobos and other animals==
Genital-genital rubbing has been observed between males in regards to other animals as well. The homosexual activities of [[bonobo]]s are of special interest because of their genetic closeness to humans; however, despite their genetic similarity, bonobo sexuality has been described as "not driven by orgasm or seeking release. Nor is it often reproductively driven. Sex for a bonobo is casual, it's quick".<ref>www.ishipress.com/sci-bono.htm</ref> Among [[bonobo]]s, frot frequently occurs when two males hang from a tree limb and engage in penis fencing. Frot also occurs while two males are in [[missionary position]]. A special form of frot called "rump rubbing" in which males stand back to back on all fours and rub their genito-anal regions together.<ref name="ReferenceA">community-2.webtv.net/headbands/GAYANIMALS/index.html</ref>

Frot-like genital rubbing between non-human males has been observed among bull manatees, in conjunction with "kissing". Bottlenose dolphins have been observed rubbing their genitals against the genital area of other males often leading to the penetration of the genital slit, or less commonly the anus.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Other forms of frot are also common among homosexually active mammals.<ref>Bagemihl, Bruce. ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity''. St. Martin's Press, 1999.</ref> Most species of bird do not possess a penis; for those animals, the distinction between penetrative and non-penetrative sex does not exist, though mounting and insemination are common aspects of avian homosexuality even when a phallic organ is not present.
