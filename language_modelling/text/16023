[[ESPN on ABC|ABC]] and [[ESPN]] (along with their family of networks) carry the [[Little League World Series]] as well the Regional Championships which precede the event.

==History==
The only game of the Little League World Series televised for many years was the Championship Game, which ABC aired under the ''[[Wide World of Sports]]'' umbrella on the weekend. ABC began televising this game in 1962,<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/sports/bbw/2002-08-28/clubhouse.htm</ref> and this was done on a tape-delay basis until 1985.<ref>http://www.littleleague.org/Learn_More/About_Our_Organization/historyandmission/chronology.htm</ref>

ESPN first began covering the games in 1982. With the expansion of ESPN's brand and its family of networks, the total number of games has significantly increased. In 2000, a total of 12 games were televised by ESPN. In addition, the popularity of the game increased the total number of teams from 8 to 16 and ESPN covered all eight regional championships in 2001 (something they still do today). This was as a result of a second stadium, [[Volunteer Stadium]], which allowed games to take place simultaneously. Also that year, ABC began televising the U.S. Championship Game. That year, ESPN aired a total of 25 games. In 2003, ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2 carried a total of 35 games including regional championships.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=677485&type=story</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/18/sports/baseball/18LITT.html?ei=5007&en=e42df3eaa8172335&ex=1376539200&partner=USERLAND&pagewanted=all&position=</ref>

One of the most prominent announcers was [[Harold Reynolds]]. Tony Gwynn referred to him as "the Pied Piper of Little League baseball."<ref>http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/maffei/article_ba581dd1-28aa-5880-b16f-8912b5b36b00.html</ref>

==Features==

===Non-game action===
ESPN has a presence in Williamsport outside the games. It typically airs ''[[SportsCenter]]'' on-site as well as ''[[Baseball Tonight]]'' during the series. It also airs stand-alone shows such as pre-game and web-gem specials.<ref>http://www.espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_08_aug/20070815_ABCESPNandESPN2CombinetoDeliverEvery.htm</ref> In 2005, LLWS was featured as part of ESPN's ''50 States in 50 days'' tour.

==Criticism==
Some{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that there is too much exposure for the Little League World Series, especially the effect it has on the participants. ESPN's Tim Scanlon defended the network's coverage, "We're not trying to hide or patronize the coverage... but you don't want to sensationalize those moments. It's about the experience and the competition. It's pure. It's almost innocent."<ref>http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geuynSYYdKqGIA_clXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTE0cTcwM2FvBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMjMEY29sbwNhYzIEdnRpZANGNjY1XzEyNg--/SIG=15hqq1i50/EXP=1250472786/**http%3a//www.nytimes.com/2003/08/18/sports/baseball/18LITT.html%3fei=5007%26en=e42df3eaa8172335%26ex=1376539200%26partner=USERLAND%26pagewanted=all%26position=</ref>
