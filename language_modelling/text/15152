'''''Mandatory Fun''''' is the fourteenth studio album by American musician [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. Self-produced, the album was released by [[RCA Records]] in the United States on July 15, 2014. Yankovic had previously released ''[[Alpocalypse]]'' in 2011, and toured in support of it when he first spoke of his next record. When he began to work on what would become ''Mandatory Fun'', Yankovic found himself listening to older acts, many of which he would stylistically spoof on the album.

Recorded at studios in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Massachusetts]] from 2012 to 2014, the album contains twelve songs, which include parodies of songs by [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Robin Thicke]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Lorde]] and [[Imagine Dragons]]. It also features original songs in the form of [[pastiche]], imitating the styles of the [[Pixies]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] and [[Southern Culture on the Skids]]. Yankovic composed the originals first, and wrote parodies last in order for them to be as timely as possible upon the album's release. Many artists reacted positively to being parodied; Williams remarked that he was "honored" to be spoofed by Yankovic, while Imagine Dragons advised Yankovic on how to replicate sounds in their original song.

After Yankovic's 32 years under contract, ''Mandatory Fun'' marks his first [[List of Billboard 200 number-one albums of 2014|number one]] album in the United States. It received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Yankovic chose not to release a [[lead single]] and instead publicized the album by launching eight [[music video]]s online during the first week of the album release through different video content portals. Among these, "[[Word Crimes]]" became Yankovic's fourth top 40 song, making him one of few artists to achieve such a feat in four separate decades. Due to the completion of his record contract obligations and the success of the video strategy, Yankovic has suggested ''Mandatory Fun'' may be his last traditional album, switching to more timely releases of singles and EPs of his songs.

==Background==
During the closing stages of the ''[[Alpocalypse]]'' tour, Yankovic stated in an interview with ''[[The Morning Call]]'' that he had one more album on his contract; the paper and other sources took to mean that this album would be his last.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-06-02/entertainment/mc-homepage-headlines-0531-6-20130602_1_parody-album-sharona |title='Weird Al' Yankovic, playing Sands Center, says next album will be his last |first=Josh |last=Moser |date=2013-06-02 |accessdate=2014-06-22 |work=[[The Morning Call]]}}</ref> Yankovic later clarified that this was the last album on the current recording contract with his label, that he is currently "weighing his options" for renewing the contract or looking to another publisher, and made it clear that he was not retiring from music in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite web |title=Let Me Be Clear About This |date=June 6, 2013 |website=Al's Blog - The Weblog of "Weird Al" Yankovic |url=http://alyankovic.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/let-me-be-clear-about-this/ |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref> In a later interview with [[NPR]]'s ''Weekend Edition'', he stated that this might be his last conventional album, turning instead to more frequent releases of singles and EPs. For an LP, Yankovic stated that given the time lapse between the beginning of the process and the release of the finished product, "chances are a lot of the material is going to be somewhat dated by the time it comes out".<ref name="NPR">{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/2014/07/12/329873481/weird-al-yankovic-on-parody-in-the-age-of-youtube |title='Weird Al' Yankovic on Parody in the Age of YouTube |date=July 12, 2014 |accessdate=July 12, 2014 |publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>

Yankovic noted that his usual method of generating parody ideas is to scan ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, radio play and online buzz in order to create a master list of candidates. From that point, he works out possible puns on the song titles, the potential for humor and general direction for his versions.<ref name="NPR"/> Fans speculated ahead of the album's release that Yankovic would parody "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" from the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', due to the song's popularity. He later explained that he considered making a ''Frozen'' parody titled "Make It So" about ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', but decided not to after discovering such a parody already existed. Yankovic observed that the existing spoof "had gotten enough attention online to make the Disney legal department ask them to take it down! I couldn't think of an idea that I liked as much as 'Make It So', so... I gave up!".<ref name="Reddit"/> There were several other songs he intended to parody, but felt he was unable to develop a clever enough idea for, and instead used them in the medley "Now That's What I Call Polka".<ref name="NPR"/> More specifically, Yankovic expressed that while [[Daft Punk]]'s "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]" is an "iconic song", it was too repetitive for him to incorporate new lyrics into effectively.<ref name="Newsweek"/>

==Recording==
[[File:Iggy Azalea - Irving Plaza NYC (13951439487).jpg|thumb|left|Yankovic approached [[Iggy Azalea]] in person for permission to parody her song "[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]".]]
Twelve songs were recorded for ''Mandatory Fun''. Most of the sessions took place at Way Station, GoDaveyGo Studio and Bedrock L.A. in Los Angeles.<ref name="LinerNotes"/> Yankovic pre-recorded [[demo (music)|demos]] of each song on his personal laptop prior to recording, to show his bandmates the direction to go in.<ref name="vice"/> The earliest songs produced were "Mission Statement", "[[Lame Claim to Fame]]" and "My Own Eyes", which were recorded on September 4, 2012. Three more songs were later recorded: "Sports Song" on May 3, followed by "First World Problems" and "Jackson Park Express" on May 8, 2013.<ref name="Recording">[http://www.weirdal.com/rcdgdate.htm "Weird Al" Yankovic: Recording Dates]. weirdal.com.

As usual for him, Yankovic sought permission from the original artists for his parodies; in contrast to previous albums, he had few difficulties in obtaining these. Yankovic stated "This is the first time where I've gotten everybody that I wanted, and I couldn't be happier about it."<ref name="billboard" /> He was able to get [[Pharrell Williams]]' permission for three of the songs he represented on the album, Williams' "[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]", [[Robin Thicke]]'s "[[Blurred Lines]]", and "Get Lucky", through a personal email to the artist after Yankovic's manager had difficulty working this with Williams' manager; according to Yankovic, Williams was "honored" to have his work used by Yankovic.<ref name="billboard" /> Yankovic and his band got full cooperation from [[Imagine Dragons]], who gave permission and advised on how to recreate some of the sounds used in "[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]" for Yankovic's sendup "Inactive".<ref name="billboard" />

[[File:PHARRELL WILLIAMS by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pharrell Williams]] was "honored" to give Yankovic permission to use his song "[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]".]]
When Yankovic decided to parody "Blurred Lines", he was initially concerned that by the time his version would be released a year later, many parodies would already exist.<ref name="exclaim" /> He therefore opted to go in a more distinct direction by making "[[Word Crimes]]", which continues his fascination with grammar previously expressed in video set pieces where he corrected malformed signage and text in public. Yankovic said that his version avoids the perceived misogyny of the original song and its various existing parodies.<ref name="NPR" /> He also considered this "the only chance that 'Blurred Lines' will be used in the curriculum of somebody's school".<ref name="exclaim">{{cite web | url = http://exclaim.ca/News/weird_al_yankovic_on_arcade_fire_robin_thicke_prince_mandatory_fun | title = "Weird Al" Yankovic on Arcade Fire, Robin Thicke, Prince and 'Mandatory Fun' | first=  Vish | last = Khanna | date=  July 15, 2014 | accessdate = July 15, 2014 | publisher = [[Exclaim.ca]] }}</ref> "Word Crimes", "Inactive" and "[[Foil (song)|Foil]]" were all recorded in December 2013 while "[[Tacky (song)|Tacky]]" and "Now That's What I Call Polka!" were produced the following April.<ref name="Recording"/> [[Lisa Popeil]] also revealed in April that she would be recording with Yankovic for the album.<ref>[http://twitter.com/Lisa_Popeil/status/457751868496572416 Recording with "Weird Al" for his new album earlier this evening!] @Lisa_Popeil on [[Twitter]].

Eleven tracks had been completed by early 2014, and Yankovic set the release date in the middle of the year as to keep the material "as timely as possible". However, he wished to find "the big hit of the summer" to add to the set.<ref name="businessweek">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-07-21/weird-al-yankovics-mandatory-fun-owns-the-internet | title = The Internet Should Have Killed Weird Al.

==Composition==
''Mandatory Fun'' consists of twelve tracks, five of which are parodies of songs [[Popular music|popular at the time]] of the album's production. The opening Iggy Azalea parody of "Fancy" is "Handy", performed from the point of view of a person described by Kenneth Partridge of ''Billboard'' as "the world's most braggadocious [[general contractor|contractor]]". The character portrayed in the song rhymes about various [[handyman]] tasks including installing countertops, tile floors, and repairing leaf blowers.<ref name="bb review"/> Kevin O'Keeffe of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' noted that the only direct connection between the character and Azalea is the line "I got 99 problems but a switch ain't one", which refers to Azalea's appearance in the song "[[Problem (Ariana Grande song)|Problem]]".<ref name="Wire">[http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/07/ranking-weird-als-new-parodies-who-gets-skewered-best/374466/ Ranking Weird Al<U+2019>s 'Mandatory Fun' Parodies: Who Gets Skewered Best?]. ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''. Retrieved on July 15, 2014.</ref>

The Southern Culture on the Skids pastiche "Lame Claim to Fame" examines celebrity-obsessed culture.<ref name="bb review"/> It features frequent [[name-dropping|name-drops]] as the singer brags about having tangential associations with popular people.<ref name="ABCNews"/> "Foil" is a parody of the Lorde song "Royals" and focuses on two cases of [[aluminum foil]] use: the first verse deals with food being preserved with the material, while the second verse describes the foil being used by conspiracy theorists as a [[Tin foil hat|protective hat]]. O'Keeffe observed that it is the shortest parody on ''Mandatory Fun'' as it omits the bridge and final chorus of the original song.<ref name="Wire"/> The original composition "Sports Song" imagines a college marching band directly insulting the opposing team with their [[fight song]].<ref name="bb review"/> Annie Zaleski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' summarized the track as a "passable but not particularly inspired take on rabid fandom".<ref name="avclub review"/>

[[File:Robin Thicke performing.jpg|thumb|right|"Word Crimes" parodies "Blurred Lines" by [[Robin Thicke]] (pictured above in 2013).|alt=Robin Thicke wearing sunglasses and holding a microphone.]]
The following Robin Thicke parody "Word Crimes" involves the singer pointing out grammatical errors frequently made in online messages, and shaming people who engage in various other common textual misconceptions.<ref name="Wire"/> "My Own Eyes" is a style parody of the [[Foo Fighters]] in which the protagonist recalls witnessing unusual events throughout his life, such as elderly men dying of "[[Justin Bieber|Bieber]] fever" and a [[mime]] "hacked to death with an imaginary cleaver". Partridge felt that the pastiche "falls flat" without [[Dave Grohl]]'s songwriting and personality.<ref name="bb review"/> "Now That's What I Call Polka!" is Yankovic's twelfth [[List of "Weird Al" Yankovic polka medleys|polka medley]], in which Yankovic sings selections of various popular songs at the time of recording, set to a [[polka]] music. The title is a parody of the long-running series of [[compilation album]]s released by [[EMI]], ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]''.

The song "Mission Statement" emulates the style of Crosby, Stills & Nash, with the lyrics citing a series of corporate [[buzzword]]s and executive [[jargon]]. Yankovic considered it "ironic to juxtapose that with the song stylings of CSN, whose music pretty much symbolizes the antithesis of corporate America".<ref name="wsj mission statement"/> ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' noted that the song imitates the band's layered harmonies used in "Carry On" and "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/weird-al-takes-on-crosby-stills-nash-for-mission-statement-video-20140721 | title = "Weird Al" takes on Crosby, Stills & Nash for "Mission Statement" video | first = Ryan | last = Reed | date = July 21, 2014 | accessdate = July 27, 2014 | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>

"Inactive" is a spoof of the Imagine Dragons song "Radioactive" that centers on an extremely lethargic character covered in food residue. O'Keeffe remarked upon the breathing sounds of the original song being recontexualized in the parody, as the character mentions that he requires an [[inhaler]].<ref name="Wire"/> The Pixies pastiche "First World Problems" lampoons people who complain of various [[First World problem]]s such as the lack of [[gluten-free diet|gluten-free]] cookies in an airport lounge. The song features "off-kilter guitars and a [[Black Francis]]-esque raucous vocal delivery" with stylistic references to the Pixies songs "[[Debaser]]" and "Hang Wire".<ref name="bb review"/><ref name="avclub review"/> The sendup of Williams' "Happy" is the song "Tacky", in which the singer boasts of having no shame and making unfashionable or tactless choices. Reviews noted that the song lists various disruptive acts associated with social media, referencing [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]], and [[Yelp]].<ref name="bb review"/><ref name="Wire"/>

Following Yankovic's tradition of recording long-form songs such as "[[Albuquerque (song)|Albuquerque]]", "Genius in France", "[[Trapped in the Drive-Thru]]", he concludes the album with a 9-minute plus track called "Jackson Park Express". The song is in the style of Cat Stevens, and described by Zaleski as "an in-depth vignette about a bus-ride-length romance that's really a figment of the protagonist's imagination."<ref name="avclub review"/> Another review detailed that the piece is a conversation between two bus passengers involving topics such as relationships,  deodorant, and wearing the skin of another person; the protagonist insists that the latter is "not in a creepy way."<ref>Greennagel, Kathryn Saari.

Regarding the title of the album, he mentioned that, "That was just an oxymoron that I've always been amused by. It's used a lot in corporate retreats and, I'm told, in the military." Yankovic also acknowledged that the name is speculated to be a reference to the album marking the end of his 32-year-long label contract.<ref name="NPR"/>

==Promotion==
Before the album was complete and a release date was set, Yankovic had already booked promotional appearances that coincidentally fell around the album's time of release: this included an appearance on the YouTube series ''[[Epic Rap Battles of History]]'' where he dressed as [[Isaac Newton]], and the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[Drunk History]]'' where he played [[Adolf Hitler]].<ref name="vice"/>  Yankovic started hinting at the release of ''Mandatory Fun'' using social media in mid-June 2014. On June 14, he posted a self-described "cryptic" image of himself with the message "July 15", which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' specified as being the album release date.<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> Yankovic used a series of short trailers to tease the album, using stock footage of historical communism and military propaganda films interspersed with imagery from the album cover art.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN6vPOC9eFg Transmission #1].

To help promote ''Mandatory Fun'' in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight [[music video]]s for the album; one was revealed each day starting on July 14, 2014, a day prior to the album's release. Yankovic commented that "there is no more music television" as there was in the past, and that "the Internet [...] is the new [[MTV]]" that operates continuously. He felt that promoting a new video for eight continuous days "would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long".<ref name="foxnews 8days"/> The approach has been compared to [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]' marketing for her album ''[[Beyonc<U+00E9> (album)|Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'' which took advantage of social media;<ref name="billboard beyonce"/><ref name="atlantic"/> when asked if this video strategy was influenced by Knowles, Yankovic pointed out that his previous record ''[[Alpocalypse]]'' featured videos for every song at the time of release: "Nobody said to Beyonc<U+00E9>, 'Hey, you're doing a Weird Al, aren't ya?' So for the record, I was first."<ref name="NPR"/>

Although the music video aspect of Yankovic's songs had long been a part of his success, RCA Records opted not to fund any video production for ''Mandatory Fun''. Yankovic instead turned to various social media portals including [[Funny or Die]] and [[CollegeHumor]] which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them.<ref name="adage"/> This release strategy was considered by ''[[The Atlantic]]'' as a "web-enabled precision video delivery operation, and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought" as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site.<ref name="atlantic">{{cite web | url = http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-surprisingly-savvy-weird-al-internet-machine/374649/ | title = The Surprisingly Savvy Weird Al Internet Machine | first = Robinson | last = Meyer | date = July 19, 2014 | accessdate = July 20, 2014 | work = [[The Atlantic]] }}</ref> During an interview on [[Fox Business Network|Fox Business]], Yankovic explained his method of funding to [[Stuart Varney]], who seemed to misunderstand the possible monetization of Yankovic's videos.<ref name="vice">{{cite web | url = http://www.vice.com/read/weird-al-yankovic-explains-how-he-conquered-the-internet-722 | title = "Weird Al" Yankovic Explains How He Conquered the Internet | first = Pearl | last = Mike | date = July 22, 2014 | accessdate = July 22, 2014 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref>
