The '''80th Boat Race''' took place on 28 March 1928.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]]. In a race umpired by former Oxford rower [[Charles Burnell]], Cambridge won by ten lengths, the largest margin of victory since 1900, in a time of 20 minutes 25 seconds.  The victory took the overall record to 40&ndash;39 in Oxford's favour.

==Background==
[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 20 August 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 20 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 24 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford&ndash;Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref>  Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1927|1927 race]] by three lengths, with Oxford leading overall with 40 victories to Cambridge's 38 (excluding the [[The Boat Race 1877|"dead heat" of 1877]]).<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url= http://theboatraces.org/classic-moments-the-1877-dead-heat | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Classic moments <U+2013> the 1877 dead heat | accessdate =20 August 2014}}</ref>

Oxford were coached by H. R. Baker (who rowed for the Dark Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1908|1908]] and [[The Boat Race 1909|1909 races]]), A. E. Kitchin (who also rowed in 1908), P. C. Mallam (a Dark Blue from 1921 to 1924 inclusive), C. M. Pitman (who rowed four times between 1892 and 1895) and J. D. W. Thomson (who was a three-time Blue between 1925 and 1927). Cambridge's coaches were  [[William Dudley Ward]] (who had rowed in [[The Boat Race 1897|1897]], [[The Boat Race 1899|1899]] and [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 races]]), Francis Escombe, P. H. Thomas (a four-time Blue between 1902 and 1905) and David Alexander Wauchope (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1895|1895 race]]).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  For the second year the umpire was [[Charles Burnell]] who had rowed for Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1895|1895]], [[The Boat Race 1896|1896]], [[The Boat Race 1897|1897]] and [[The Boat Race 1898|1898 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 97</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 9.625&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (80.4&nbsp;kg), {{convert|0.625|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge's crew contained three participants with Boat Race experience:  R. Beesly, J. C. Holcroft and [[Stroke (rowing)#Stroke seat|stroke]] T. E. Letchworth.  Oxford saw four participants return, including number two T. W. Shaw and [[Coxswain (rowing)|cox]] J. H. Croft, both of whom were making their third consecutive appearance in the event.<ref name=burn73/>  One participant was registered as non-British:  Oxford's number four H. C. Morphett was from Australia.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>  

According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater, the Cambridge crew were "really good" with the [[The Boat Race#Build-up|trial eights]] being "much above the average".<ref name=drink149>Drinkwater, p. 149</ref>  After relocating to Ely in the build-up to the race, Cambridge's crew was reorganised and improved, before final modifications were made at Putney.  Drinkwater stated "it was obvious that they were going to be a fast crew".<ref name=drink149/>  Conversely, Oxford suffered from "a dearth of experienced material" who "never developed and were quite incapable of rowing a racing stroke".<ref name=drink149/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Oxford won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Cambridge.<ref name=burn73/>  Burnell started the race at 9:45&nbsp;a.m. in reasonable conditions but on a poor tide.  Cambridge took the lead from the start and were half a length ahead by the time they passed the boathouses ({{convert|400|yd|m}} along the course).  Dropping the [[stroke rate]] to 29 strokes per minute, the Light Blues held off the faster rating Oxford to the Mile Post.  Here Cambridge pushed away quickly and, according to Drinkwater, "long before [[Hammersmith Bridge|Hammersmith]] the race had become a procession", so much so that Cambridge reduced their efforts to a paddle.<ref>Drinkwater, p. 150</ref>

Cambridge won by ten lengths in a time of 20 minutes 25 seconds, the slowest winning time since the [[The Boat Race 1925|1925 race]].  It was their fifth consecutive victory and their ninth win in ten races and took the overall record to 40&ndash;39 in Oxford's favour.  It was the largest winning margin where both boats completed the course since the [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 race]].<ref name=results/>
