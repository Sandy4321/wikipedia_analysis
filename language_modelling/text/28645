The '''Nardevitz Erratic''' ({{lang-de|Findling Nardevitz}}), also called the '''Great Rock of Nardewitz''' (''Gro<U+00DF>er Stein von Nardevitz''), is one of the largest [[glacial erratic]]s in North Germany. It lies about 400&nbsp;metres north of Nardevitz, a village in the parish of [[Lohme]] on the island of [[R<U+00FC>gen]]. 
Surrounded by trees and bushes as well as other [[drift material]] that was in the way of farming, it lies in the middle of a field. Its volume is estimated at 104&nbsp;m<U+00B3>, which gives it a mass of 281&nbsp;tonnes. The above-ground portion has a volume of 71&nbsp;m<U+00B3>. It is therefore, apart from [[Buskam]] which lies in the [[Baltic Sea]] off [[G<U+00F6>hren (R<U+00FC>gen)|G<U+00F6>hren]], the largest erratic on R<U+00FC>gen and an important geological sight.

Because the Nardevitz Erratic was used for a long time to obtain construction material, it is suspected today that it was once three times its present size. For example, in 1854 and 1855, [[column drum]]s weighing about five tonne and pedestal blocks, up to 2 tonnes in weight, for the [[Prussian Columns]] near Neukamp and Gro<U+00DF> Stresow were hewn from the rock. On the rock itself there are clear traces that show there were plans for further destruction of the erractic.

Today the Nardevitz Rock, like around 20 other erratics on the island of R<U+00FC>gen, is one of its legally-protected [[geotope]]s. It is recorded in the relevant register at the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern State Office for the Environment, Conservation and Geology (''Landesamt f<U+00FC>r Umwelt, Naturschutz und Geologie Mecklenburg-Vorpommern'') as entry "G2 75".

== Origin and geological features ==
The Nardevitz Erratic is made of [[granite]], whose coarse-grained structure corresponds to the [[hammer granite]] bedrock found on the island of [[Bornholm]]. Its [[potassium feldspar]] spars are brownish-grey to pale red and up to 1.5&nbsp;centimetres across. The up to five&nbsp;millimetre wide [[quartz]] crystals have a brownish tinge.
