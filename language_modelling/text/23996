The '''Xiongnu''' ({{zh-cpw|c=<U+5308><U+5974>|p=Xi<U+014D>ngn<U+00FA>|w=Hsiung-nu}}); were a [[nomadic]] people from [[Central Asia]], generally based in present day [[Mongolia]] and [[China]]. From the [[3rd century BC]] they controlled a vast [[steppe]] empire extending west as far as the [[Caucasus]]. They were active in the areas of southern [[Siberia]], western [[Manchuria]] and the modern [[China|Chinese]] [[Province of China|provinces]] of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xinjiang]]. Very ancient (perhaps legendary) historic Chinese records say that the Xiongnu descended from a son of the final ruler of [[China]]'s first dynasty ([[Xia Dynasty]]), the remnants of which were believed by the Chinese of the [[Spring and Autumn Period]] to be the people of the state of [[State of Qi|Q<U+01D0>]] (<U+675E>). However, due to internal differences and strife, the Xiongnu fled north and north-west.

Relations between the [[Han Chinese]] and the Xiongnu were complicated and included [[military]] conflict, exchanges in [[tribute]] and trade, as well as marriage treaties.

== Origins, languages and early history of the Xiongnu ==
The original geographic location of Xiongnu is generally placed at the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]]. According to [[Sima Qian]], the Xiongnu were descendants of [[Chunwei]] (<U+6DF3><U+7DAD>), possibly a son of [[Jie (ruler)|Jie]], the final ruler of the [[Xia Dynasty]]. However, while there is no direct evidence contradicting this theory, there is no direct evidence supporting it either.

The language of Xiongnu reflects without any scholarly consensus, based on the analysis between early [[19th century]] to [[20th century]] different opinions were proposed; proponents of the [[Turkic languages]] included [[Jean-Pierre Abel-R<U+00E9>musat]], [[Julius Klaproth]], Shiratori Kurakichi, [[Gustaf John Ramstedt]], Annemarie von Gabain and [[Omeljan Pritsak]], while others; like [[Paul Pelliot]] insisted a [[Mongolic]] origin; Albert Terrien de Lacouperie considered them to be multi component groups.<ref> GENG Shi-min [http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/qikan/periodical.Articles/yyyfy/yyyf2005/0502/050201.htm On Altaic Common Language and Xiongnu Language.] (Wanfang Data: Digital Periodicals, 2005)</ref>

Lajos Ligeti was the first to suggest that the Xiongnu spoke a [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] language. In the early 1960s Edwin Pulleyblank was the first to expand upon this idea with credible evidence.  In 2000, [[Alexander Vovin]] reanalyzed Pulleyblank's argument and found further support for it by utilizing the most recent reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology by Starostin and Baxter and a single Chinese transcription of a sentence in the language of the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] (a member tribe of the Xiongnu confederacy).  Previous Turkic interpretations of the aforementioned sentence do not match the Chinese translation as precisely as using Yeniseian grammar.<ref>Vovin, Alexander. "Did the Xiongnu speak a Yeniseian language?". Central Asiatic Journal 44/1 (2000), pp. 87-104.</ref>

== Confederation under Modu (<U+5192><U+987F>) ==
[[Image:Hsiung-nu-Empire.png|right|400px|thumb|Domain and influence of Xiongnu under [[Modu Shanyu]]]]

In [[209 BC]], just three years before the founding of the [[Han Dynasty]], the Xiongnu were brought together in a powerful [[confederacy]] under a new ''[[chanyu]]'' named [[Modu Shanyu]] (known as Modu to Chinese and Mete in Turkish). The Xiongnu's political unity transformed them into a much more formidable foe by enabling them to concentrate larger forces and exercise better strategic coordination. The cause of the confederation, however, remains unclear. It has been suggested that the unification of China prompted the nomads to rally around a political centre in order to strengthen their position.<ref>Barfield, Thomas. ''The Perilous Frontier'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1989).</ref> Another theory is that the reorganisation was their response to the political crisis that overtook them [[215 BC]], when [[Qin]] armies evicted them from pastures on the [[Yellow River]].<ref>Di Cosmo, "The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China", in ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China'', edited by Michael Loewe and Edward Shaughnessy, pp. 885-966. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999.</ref>

After forging internal unity, Modun expanded the empire on all sides. To the north he conquered a number of nomadic peoples, including the [[Dingling]] of southern Siberia. He crushed the power of the [[Donghu]] of eastern Mongolia and Manchuria, as well as the [[Yuezhi]] in the Gansu corridor. He was able, moreover, to recover all the lands taken by the Qin general [[Meng Tian]]. Before the death of Modun in [[174 BC]], the Xiongnu had driven the Yuezhi from the [[Gansu]] corridor completely and asserted their presence in the [[Western Regions]] in modern Xinjiang.

=== Nature of the Xiongnu state ===
Under Modun, a dualistic system of political organisation was formed. The left and right branches of the Xiongnu were divided on a regional basis. The ''[[chanyu]]'' or ''shan-y<U+00FC>'' <U+2014> supreme ruler equivalent to the Chinese "[[Son of Heaven]]" <U+2014> exercised direct authority over the central territory. [[Longcheng]] (<U+8622><U+57CE>), near Koshu-Tsaidam in Mongolia, was established as the annual meeting place and ''de facto''  capital.

== The marriage treaty system ==
In the winter of [[200 BC]], following a siege of [[Taiyuan]], [[Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]] personally led a military campaign against Modun. At the [[battle of Baideng]], he was ambushed reputedly by 300,000 elite Xiongnu cavalry. The emperor was cut off from supplies and reinforcements for seven days, only narrowly escaping capture.

After the defeat at Pingcheng, the Han emperor abandoned a military solution to the Xiongnu threat. Instead, in [[198 BC]], the courtier Liu Jing (<U+5289><U+656C>) was despatched for negotiations. The peace settlement eventually reached between the parties included a Han princess given in marriage to the ''chanyu'' (called ''[[heqin]]'' <U+548C><U+89AA> or "harmonious kinship"); periodic gifts of [[silk]], [[liquor]] and [[rice]] to the Xiongnu; equal status between the states; and the [[Great Wall]] as mutual border.

This first treaty set the pattern for relations between the Han and the Xiongnu for some sixty years. Up to [[135 BC]], the treaty was renewed no less than nine times, with an increase of "gifts" with each subsequent agreement. In [[192 BC]], Modun even asked for the hand of the widowed Empress L<U+00FC>. His son and successor, the energetic Jiyu (<U+7A3D><U+7CA5>), known as the "[[Laoshang]] ''chanyu''" (<U+8001><U+4E0A><U+55AE><U+4E8E>), continued his father's expansionist policies. Laoshang succeeded in negotiating with [[Emperor Wen of Han China|Emperor Wen]], terms for the maintenance of a large-scale government-sponsored market system.

While much was gained by the Xiongnu, from the Chinese perspective marriage treaties were costly and ineffective. Laoshang showed that he did not take the peace treaty seriously. On one occasion his scouts penetrated to a point near [[Chang'an]]. In [[166 BC]] he personally led 140,000 cavalry to invade Anding, reaching as far as the imperial retreat at Yong. In [[158 BC]], his successor sent 30,000 cavalry to attack the Shang commandery and another 30,000 to Yunzhong.

== War with Han China ==
{{main|Sino-Xiongnu War}}

[[Han Dynasty|Han China]] was making preparations for a military confrontation from the reign of [[Emperor Wen of Han|Emperor Wen]]. The break came in [[133 BC]], following an abortive trap to ambush the ''chanyu'' at Mayi. By that point the empire was consolidated politically, militarily, and financially, and was led by an adventurous pro-war faction at court. In that year, [[Emperor Wu of Han China|Emperor Wu]] reversed the decision he had made the year before to renew the peace treaty. 

Full scale war broke out in autumn [[129 BC]], when 40,000 Chinese [[cavalry]] made a surprise attack on the Xiongnu at the border markets. In [[127 BC]], the Han general [[Wei Qing]] (<U+885B><U+9752>) retook the [[Ordos]]. In [[121 BC]], the Xiongnu suffered another setback when [[Huo Qubing]] (<U+970D><U+53BB><U+75C5>) led a force of light cavalry westward out of Longxi and within six days fought his way through five Xiongnu kingdoms. The Xiongnu Hunye king was forced to surrender with 40,000 men. In [[119 BC]] both Huo and Wei, each leading 50,000 cavalrymen and 100,000 footsoldiers, and advancing along different routes, forced the ''chanyu'' and his court to flee north of the [[Gobi Desert]].<ref>These campaigns are described in detail by Michael Loewe, "The campaigns of Han Wu-ti", in ''Chinese ways in warfare'', ed. Frank A. Kierman, Jr., and John K. Fairbank (Cambridge, Mass., 1974).</ref>

Major logistical difficulties limited the duration and long-term continuation of these campaigns. According the analysis of Yan You (<U+56B4><U+5C24>), the difficulties were twofold. Firstly there was the problem of supplying food across long distances. Secondly, the weather in the northern Xiongnu lands was difficult for Han soldiers, who could never carry enough fuel.<ref>This view was put forward to [[Wang Mang]] in AD [[14]]: ''Han Shu'' (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju edition) 94B, p. 3824.</ref> According to official reports, Xiongnu's side lost 80,000 to 90,000 men. And out of the 140,000 horses the Han forces had brought into the desert, fewer than 30,000 returned to [[China]].

As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Desert|Ordos]] and Gansu corridor to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang|Qiang peoples]] to the south, and also gained direct access to the [[Western Regions]].

== Leadership struggle among the Xiongnu ==

As the Xiongnu empire expanded, it became clear that the original leadership structures lacked flexibility and could not maintain effective cohesion. The traditional succession of the eldest son became increasingly ineffective in meeting wartime emergencies in the [[1st century BC]]. To combat the problems of succession, the ''chanyu'' Huhanye ([[58 BC]]-[[31 BC]]) later laid down the rule that his heir apparent must pass the throne on to a younger brother. This pattern of fraternal succession did indeed become the norm.

The growth of [[regionalism]] became clear around this period, when local kings refused to attend the annual meetings at the ''chanyu'''s court. During this period, ''chanyu'' were forced to develop power bases in their own regions to secure the throne.

In the period [[114 BC]] to [[60 BC]], the Xiongnu produced altogether seven ''chanyu''. Two of them, Chanshilu and Huyanti, assumed the office while still children. In 60 BC, Tuqitang, the "[[wise king of the right]]", became ''chanyu'' Wuyanjuti. No sooner had he come to the throne, than he began to purge from power those whose base lay in the [[left group]]. Thus antagonised, in [[58 BC]] the [[nobility of the left]] put forward Huhanye as their own ''chanyu''. The year [[57 BC]] saw a struggle for power among five regional groupings, each with its own ''chanyu''. In [[54 BC]] Huhanye abandoned his capital in the north after being defeated by his brother, the ''chanyu'' [[Zhizhi Chanyu|Zhizhi]].

== Tributary relations with the Han ==
[[Image:Han Civilisation.png|thumb|350px|The [[Han Dynasty]] world order.]]
In [[53 BC]] Huyanye (<U+547C><U+97D3><U+90AA> Pinyin: H<U+016B> H<U+00E1>ny<U+00E9>) decided to enter into [[List of tributary of Imperial China|tributary relations]] with [[Han China]]. The original terms insisted on by the Han court were that, first, the ''chanyu'' or his representatives should come to the capital to pay homage; secondly, the ''chanyu'' should send a hostage prince; and thirdly, the ''chanyu'' should present tribute to the Han emperor. The political status of the Xiongnu in the Chinese world order was reduced from that of a "brotherly state" to that of an "outer vassal" (<U+5916><U+81E3>). During this period, however, the Xiongnu maintained political sovereignty and full territorial integrity. The [[Great Wall of China]] continued to serve as the line of demarcation between Han and Xiongnu.

Huyanye sent his son, the "wise king of the right" Shuloujutang, to the Han court as hostage. In [[51 BC]] he personally visited Chang'an to pay homage to the emperor on the [[Chinese New Year]]. On the financial side, Huhanye was amply rewarded in large quantities of gold, cash, clothes, silk, horses and grain for his participation. Huhanye made two more homage trips, in [[49 BC]] and [[33 BC]]; with each one the imperial gifts were increased. On the last trip, Huhanye took the opportunity to ask to be allowed to become an imperial son-in-law. As a sign of the decline in the political status of the Xiongnu, [[Emperor Yuan of Han|Emperor Yuan]] refused, giving him instead five ladies-in-waiting. One of them was [[Wang Zhaojun]], famed in Chinese folklore as one of the [[Four Beauties]].

When Zhizhi learned of his brother's submission, he also sent a son to the Han court as hostage in [[53 BC]]. Then twice, in [[51 BC]] and [[50 BC]], he sent envoys to the Han court with tribute. But having failed to pay homage personally, he was never admitted to the tributary system. In [[36 BC]], a junior officer named [[Chen Tang]], with the help of Gan Yanshou, protector-general of the Western Regions, assembled an expeditionary force that defeated [[Battle of Zhizhi|Zhizhi]] and sent his head as a trophy to Chang'an.

Tributary relations were discontinued during the reign of Huduershi (AD [[18]]-[[48]]), corresponding to the political upheavals of the [[Xin Dynasty]] in China. The Xiongnu took the opportunity to regain control of the western regions, as well as neighbouring peoples such as the [[Wuhuan]]. In AD [[24]], Hudershi even talked about reversing the tributary system.

== Northern and southern Xiongnu ==

The Xiongnu's new power was met with a policy of appeasement by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]]. At the height of his power, Huduershi even compared himself to his illustrious ancestor, Modu. Due to growing regionalism among the Xiongnu, however, Huduershi was never able to establish unquestioned authority. When he designated his son as heir apparent (in contravention of the principle of fraternal succession established by Huhanye), Bi, the [[Rizhu]] king of the right, refused to attend the annual meeting at the ''chanyu'''s court.

As the eldest son of the preceding ''chanyu'', Bi had a legitimate claim to the succession. In AD [[48]], two years after Huduershi's son Punu ascended the throne, eight Xiongnu tribes in Bi's powerbase in the south, with a military force totalling 40,000 to 50,000 men, acclaimed Bi as their own ''chanyu''. Throughout the Eastern Han period, these two groups were called the southern Xiongnu and the northern Xiongnu, respectively. 

Hard pressed by the northern Xiongnu and plagued by natural calamities, Bi brought the southern Xiongnu into tributary relations with Han China in AD [[50]]. The tributary system was considerably tightened to keep the southern Xiongnu under Han supervision. The ''chanyu'' was ordered to establish his court in the Meiji district of Xihe commandery. The Southern Xiongnu were resettled in eight frontier commanderies. At the same time, large numbers of Chinese were forced to migrate to these commanderies, where mixed settlements began to appear.

Economically, the southern Xiongnu relied almost totally on Han assistance. Tensions were evident between the settled Chinese and practitioners of the nomadic way of life. Thus, in [[94]] ''chanyu'' Anguo joined forces with newly subjugated Xiongnu from the north and started a large scale rebellion against the Han.

Towards the end of the Eastern Han, the southern Xiongnu were drawn into the rebellions then plaguing the Han court. In 188, the ''chanyu'' was murdered by some of his own subjects for agreeing to send troops to help the Han suppress a rebellion in [[Hebei]] - many of the Xiongnu feared that it would set a precedent for unending military service to the Han court. The murdered ''chanyu's'' son succeeded him, but was then overthrown by the same rebellious faction in 189. He travelled to [[Luoyang]] (the Han capital) to seek aid from the Han court, but at this time the Han court was in disorder from the clash between Grand General [[He Jin]] and the eunuchs, and the intervention of the warlord [[Dong Zhuo]]. The ''chanyu'' named [[Yufuluo]] (<U+65BC><U+6276><U+7F85>), but entitled Chizhisizhu (<U+7279><U+81F3><U+5C38><U+9010><U+4FAF>), had no choice but to settle down with his followers in [[Pingyang]], a city in [[Shanxi]]. In 195, he died and was succeeded by his brother [[Hucuquan]] (<U+547C><U+5EDA><U+6CC9>).

In 216, the warlord-statesman [[Cao Cao]] detained Hucuquan in the city of [[Ye]], and divided his followers in Shanxi into five divisions: left, right, south, north, and centre. This was aimed at preventing the exiled Xiongnu in Shanxi from engaging in rebellion, and also allowed Cao Cao to use the Xiongnu as auxiliaries in his cavalry. Eventually, the Xiongnu aristocracy in Shanxi changed their surname from Luanti to Liu for prestige reasons, claiming that they were related to the Han imperial clan through the old intermarriage policy.

== The Xiongnu after the Han Dynasty ==

After Hucuquan (<U+547C><U+5EDA><U+6CC9>), the Xiongnu were partitioned into 5 local tribes. The complicated ethnic situation of the mixed frontier settlements instituted during the Eastern Han had grave consequences, not fully apprehended by the Chinese government until the end of the [[3rd century]]. By 260 AD Li<U+00FA> Q<U+00F9>b<U+0113>i (<U+5289><U+53BB><U+5351>) had organized the Tiefu confederacy in the North East, and by 290 AD <U+5218><U+5143><U+6D77> was leading a splinter group in the South West. At that time, non-Chinese unrest reached alarming proportions along the whole of the [[Western Jin]] frontier. 

=== Liu Yuan's Bei Han 304-318 AD ===

In [[304]] the sinicised [[Liu Yuan (Han Zhao)|Liu Yuan (<U+5289><U+6DF5>)]], a grandson of Yufuluo Chizhisizhu stirred up descendants of the southern Xiongnu in rebellion in [[Shanxi]], taking advantage of the [[War of the Eight Princes]] then raging around the Western Jin capital [[Luoyang]]. Under Liu Yuan's leadership, they were joined by a large number of frontier Chinese and became known as Bei Han. Liu Yuan used 'Han' as the name of his state, hoping to tap into the lingering nostalgia for the glory of the Han dynasty, and established his capital in [[Pingyang]]. The Xiongnu use of large numbers of [[heavy cavalry]] with iron armour for both rider and horse gave them a decisive advantage over [[J<U+00EC>n Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]] armies already weakened and demoralised by three years of civil war. In 311, they captured Luoyang, and with it the Jin emperor Sima Chi (Emperor Huai). In 316, the next Jin emperor was captured in [[Chang'an]], and the whole of north China came under Xiongnu rule while remnants of the Jin dynasty survived in the south (known to historians as the [[Eastern Jin]] dynasty).

=== Liu Yao's Former Zhou 318-329 AD ===
In 318, after suppressing a coup by a powerful minister in the Xiongnu-Han court (in which the Xiongnu-Han emperor and a large proportion of the aristocracy were massacred), the Xiongnu prince [[Liu Yao]] (<U+5289><U+66DC>) moved the Xiongnu-Han capital from Pingyang to Chang'an and renamed the dynasty as Zhao <U+8D99> (it is hence known to historians collectively as [[Han Zhao]]). However, the eastern part of north China came under the control of a rebel Xiongnu-Han general of [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] <U+7FAF> (probably [[Yeniseian]]) ancestry named [[Shi Le]] <U+77F3><U+52D2>. Liu Yao and Shi Le fought a long war until 329, when Liu Yao was captured in battle and executed. Chang'an fell to Shi Le soon after, and the Xiongnu dynasty was wiped out. North China was ruled by Shi Le's [[Later Zhao]] dynasty for the next 20 years.

However, the "Liu" Xiongnu remained active in the north for at least another century. 

=== Tiefu & Xia 260-431 AD===

The northern [[Tiefu]] <U+9435><U+5F17> branch of the Xiongnu gained control of the Inner Mongolian region in the 10 years between the conquest of the [[Tuoba]] [[Xianbei]] [[state of Dai]] by the [[Former Qin]] empire in 376, and its restoration in 386 as the [[Northern Wei]]. After 386, the Tiefu were gradually destroyed by or surrendered to the Tuoba, with the submitting Tiefu becoming known as the [[Dugu]] <U+7368><U+5B64>. Liu Bobo <U+5289><U+52C3><U+52C3>, a surviving prince of the Tiefu fled to the [[Ordos]] Loop, where he founded a state called the Xia (thus named because of the Xiongnu's supposed ancestry from the Xia dynasty) and changed his surname to Helian <U+8D6B><U+9023>. The Helian-Xia state was conquered by the Northern Wei in 428-431, and the Xiongnu thenceforth effectively ceased to play a major role in Chinese history, assimilating into the Xianbei and Han ethnicities.

As in the case of the [[Rouran]] with the [[Avars]], oversimplifications have led to the Xiongnu often being identified with the [[Huns]], who populated the frontiers of [[Europe]]. The connection started with the writings of the eighteenth century French historian de Guignes, who noticed that a few of the barbarian tribes north of China associated with the Xiongnu had been named "Hun" with varying Chinese characters. This theory remains at the level of speculation, although it is accepted by some scholars, including Chinese ones. DNA testing of Hun remains has not proven conclusive in determining the origin of the Huns.

Linguistically, it is important to understand that "''xi<U+014D>ngn<U+00FA>''" is only the modern [[standard Mandarin]] pronunciation (based on the [[Beijing]] dialect) of "<U+5308><U+5974>".  At the time of Hunnish contact with the world (the 4th<U+2013>6th centuries AD), the sound of the character "<U+5308>" has been reconstructed as  /ho<U+014B>/. 

The supposed sound of the first character has a clear similarity with the name "Hun" in European languages.  Whether this is evidence of kinship or mere coincidence is hard to tell.  It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Western Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Western Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation. 

The traditional etymology of "<U+5308>" is that it is as pictogram of the facial features of one of these people, wearing a helmet, with the "x" under the helmet representing the scars they inflicted on their faces to frighten their enemies.  However, there is no actual evidence for this interpretation.

In modern Chinese, the character "<U+5308>" is used in four ways: to mean "chest" (written <U+80F8> in this sense as the set of Chinese characters evolves), in the name <U+5308><U+5974> ''Xi<U+014D>ngn<U+00FA>'' "Xiongnu", in the word <U+5308><U+4EBA> ''Xi<U+014D>ngr<U+00E9>n'' "Hun [person]", and in the name <U+5308><U+7259><U+5229> ''Xi<U+014D>ngy<U+00E1>l<U+00EC>'' "[[Hungary]]".  The last of these is a modern coinage which may derive from the belief that the Huns were related to the Xiongnu.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The second character, "<U+5974>", appears to have no parallel in Western terminology.  Its contemporary pronunciation was /nh<U+014D>/, and it means "slave", although it is possible that it has only a phonetic role in the name <U+5308><U+5974>.  There is almost certainly no connection between the "chest" meaning of <U+5308> and its ethnic meaning.  There might conceivably be some sort of connection with the identically pronounced word "<U+51F6>", which means "fierce", "ferocious", "inauspicious", "bad", or "violent act".  Most probably, the word derives from the tribe's own name for itself as a semi-phonetic transliteraton into Chinese, and the character was chosen somewhat arbitrarily <U+2014> a practice that continues today in Chinese renderings of foreign names.

Although the phonetic side of the question is not conclusive, new results from Central Asia might conduct to shift the balance in favor of a political and cultural link between the Xiongnu and the Huns. The Central Asian sources of the IVth century translated in both direction Xiongnu by Huns (in the Sogdian Ancient Letters, the Xiongnu in Northern China are named xwn, while in the Buddhist translations by Dharmarakhsa Huna of the Indian text is translated Xiongnu). Moreover, from an archaeological point of view, it is certain that the Hunnic cauldrons are similar to the Ordos Xiongnu ones. Moreover, they were used in the same rituals, as in Hungary and in the Ordos they were found buried in river banks.

Another clue in the link between the Xiongnu and the Huns is indicated by an old Byzantine codex dating XIV. century, in it was a list in a [[Slav]] language from the early middle ages. This was decoded and translated by [[Omeljan Pritsak]] professor of history and language (at Lvov, Hamburg and Harvard University) in 1954 and named: "The Old-Bulgarian King List" [[Nominalia of the Bulgarian Khans]]. This contains the names and descendants of the [[Hun]] kings` dynasty. On the start of it is the great [[Mao-Tun]] (Modu shanyu), who established the Xiongnu Empire. Among the other descendants` names is the name of [[Ernakh]], the youngest son of [[Attila The Hun]]. The possibility of Xiongnu eventually becoming the [[Huns]] is indicated by this codex.
