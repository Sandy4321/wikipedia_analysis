{{Ancient Egyptian culture}}

'''Ancient Egyptian architecture''' is the architecture of [[ancient Egypt]], one of the most influential civilizations throughout history, which developed a vast array of diverse structures and great architectural monuments along the [[Nile]], among the largest and most famous of which are the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]].

==Characteristics==
Due to the scarcity of wood,<ref>R. G. Blakemore, ''History of Interior Design and Furniture: From Ancient Egypt to Nineteenth-Century Europe'', John Wiley and Sons 1996, p.100</ref> the two predominant building materials used in ancient Egypt were sun-baked [[mud brick]] and [[Rock (geology)|stone]], mainly limestone, but also sandstone and granite in considerable quantities.<ref>Blakemore, 1996, p.107</ref> From the [[Old Kingdom]] onward, stone was generally reserved for [[tomb]]s and [[Egyptian temple|temple]]s, while bricks were used even for royal palaces, fortresses, the walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes. The core of the pyramids came from stone quarried in the area crack while the limestone, now eroded away, that was used to face the pyramids came from the other side of the Nile  River and had to be quarried, ferried across, and cut during the dry season before they could be pulled into place on the pyramid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S. Cunningham, John J.|title=Culture and values : a survey of the humanities|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-495-56877-5|edition=7th ed.}}</ref>

Ancient Egyptian houses were made out of mud collected from the Nile river. It was placed in molds and left to dry in the hot sun to harden for use in construction.

Many Egyptian towns have disappeared because they were situated near the cultivated area of the Nile Valley and were flooded as the river bed slowly rose during the millennia, or the mud bricks of which they were built were used by peasants as fertilizer. Others are inaccessible, new buildings having been erected on ancient ones. Fortunately, the dry, hot climate of Egypt preserved some mud brick structures. Examples include the village [[Deir al-Madinah]], the Middle Kingdom town at [[El-Lahun|Kahun]],<ref>W. M. Flinders Petrie, ''Kahun, Gurob, and Hawara'', Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr<U+00FC>bner, and Co., London 1890</ref> and the fortresses at [[Buhen]]<ref>Charles Gates, ''Ancient Cities: The Archaeology of Urban Life in the Ancient Near East and Egypt, Greece and Rome'', Routledge 2003, p.101</ref> and [[Mirgissa]]. Also, many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on high ground unaffected by the Nile flood and were constructed of stone.

Thus, our understanding of ancient Egyptian architecture is based mainly on religious monuments,<ref>Dieter Arnold, Byron Esely Shafer ''Temples of Ancient Egypt'', I.B.Tauris, 2005</ref> massive structures characterized by thick, sloping walls with few openings, possibly echoing a method of construction used to obtain stability in mud walls. In a similar manner, the incised and flatly modeled surface adornment of the stone buildings may have derived from mud wall ornamentation. Although the use of the [[arch]] was developed during the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]], all monumental buildings are [[post and lintel]] constructions, with flat roofs constructed of huge stone blocks supported by the external walls and the closely spaced columns.

Exterior and interior walls, as well as the [[column]]s and [[pier (architecture)|piers]], were covered with [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]ic and pictorial frescoes and carvings painted in brilliant colors.<ref>Blakemore, 1996, pp.107ff.</ref> Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are [[symbol]]ic, such as the [[Dung beetle#Scarab in ancient Egypt|scarab]], or sacred beetle, the [[solar disk]], and the [[vulture]]. Other common motifs include [[palm tree|palm]] leaves, the [[papyrus]] plant, and the buds and flowers of the [[Nymphaea caerulea|lotus]].<ref>Arnold, 2005, pp.204ff</ref> [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Hieroglyphs]] were inscribed for decorative purposes as well as to record historic events or spells. In addition, these pictorial frescoes and carvings allow us to understand how the Ancient Egyptians lived, statuses, wars that were fought and their beliefs. This was especially true when exploring the tombs of Ancient Egyptian officials in recent years. 

Ancient Egyptian temples were aligned with astronomically significant events, such as [[solstice]]s and [[equinox]]es, requiring precise measurements at the moment of the particular event. Measurements at the most significant temples may have been ceremonially undertaken by the [[Pharaoh]] himself.<ref>"Temples aligned with the stars", ''New Scientist'' 2724 (5 Sep. 2009), p. 7; see also J. Belmonte & M. Shaltout, "Keeping Ma<U+2019>at: an astronomical approach to the orientation of the temples in ancient Egypt", ''Advances in Space Research'' (August 2009) {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2009.03.033}}</ref>

==The Giza pyramid complex==
{{Main|Giza pyramid complex}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2011}}
The Giza Necropolis stands on the [[Giza Plateau]], on the outskirts of [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. This complex of ancient monuments is located some 8 kilometers (5&nbsp;mi) inland into the desert from the old town of [[Giza]] on the Nile, some 20 kilometers (12&nbsp;mi) southwest of Cairo city center. This [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[necropolis]] consists of the [[Pyramid of Khufu]] (also known as the ''[[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]]'' and the ''Pyramid of Cheops''), the somewhat smaller [[Pyramid of Khafre]] (or Kephren/Chefren), and the relatively modest-sized [[Pyramid of Menkaure]] (or Mykerinus/Mycerinus), along with a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as "queens" pyramids, and the [[Great Sphinx]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Winston|first=Alan|title=An overview of the Giza Plateau in Egypt|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/giza.htm|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

The pyramids, which were built in the Fourth Dynasty, testify to the power of the pharaonic religion and state. They were built to serve both as grave sites and also as a way to make their names last forever.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S.

Popular culture leads people to believe that Pyramids are highly confusing, with many tunnels within the pyramid to create confusion for grave robbers. This is not true. The shafts of pyramids are quite simple, mostly leading directly to the tomb. The immense size of the pyramids attracted robbers to the wealth that lay inside which caused the tombs to be robbed relatively soon after the tomb was sealed in some cases.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S. Cunningham, John J.|title=Culture and values : a survey of the humanities|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-495-56877-5|edition=7th ed.}}</ref> However, there are sometimes additional tunnels, but these were used for the builders to understand how far they could dig the tomb into the crust of the Earth. Also, it is popular thought that due to grave robbers, future Kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings to help keep them hidden. This is also false, as the Pyramid construction continued for many Dynasties, just on a smaller scale. Finally, the pyramid construction was stopped due to economic factors, not theft.

It is widely believed that the pyramids were able to be constructed due to slave labor. Some scholars believe that they were essentially built by farmers during the off season.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S. Cunningham, John J.|title=Culture and values : a survey of the humanities|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-495-56877-5|edition=7th ed.}}</ref> Either way, the pyramids represent a lifestyle of the nobles that could not exist without the presence of slave labor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reich|first=Lawrence S. Cunningham, John J.|title=Culture and values : a survey of the humanities|year=2010|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-495-56877-5|edition=7th ed.}}</ref>

==Karnak==
{{Main|Karnak}}
The temple complex of Karnak is located on the banks of the River Nile some 2.5 kilometers (1.5&nbsp;mi) north of [[Luxor]]. It consists of four main parts, the [[Precinct of Amon-Re]], the [[Precinct of Montu]], the [[Precinct of Mut]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] (dismantled), as well as a few smaller temples and sanctuaries located outside the enclosing walls of the four main parts, and several avenues of ram-headed sphinxes connecting the Precinct of Mut, the Precinct of Amon-Re and Luxor Temple.

[[File:Hypostyle hall, Karnak temple.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The hypostyle hall of Karnak Temple]]
The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time over which it was developed and used. Construction work began in the 16th century BC. Approximately 30 pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach a size, complexity and diversity not seen elsewhere. Few of the individual features of Karnak are unique, but the size and number of features is overwhelming.

==Luxor Temple==
{{Main|Luxor Temple}}
The Luxor Temple is a huge [[ancient Egypt]]ian temple complex located on the east bank of the [[Nile|River Nile]] in the city today known as [[Luxor]] (ancient [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]). Construction work on the temple began during the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] in the 14th century BC. [[Horemheb]] and [[Tutankhamun]] added columns, statues, and friezes&nbsp;<U+2013> and [[Akhenaten]] had earlier obliterated his father's [[cartouche]]s and installed a shrine to the [[Aten]]&nbsp;<U+2013> but the only major expansion effort took place under [[Ramesses II]] some 100 years after the first stones were put in place. Luxor is thus unique among the main Egyptian temple complexes in having only two pharaohs leave their mark  on its architectural structure.

[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.06.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Luxor Temple, from the east bank of the Nile]]
The temple proper begins with the 24 meter(79&nbsp;ft) high First [[Pylon (architecture)|Pylon]], built by Ramesses II. The pylon was decorated with scenes of Ramesses's military triumphs (particularly the [[Battle of Qadesh]]); later pharaohs, particularly those of the [[Nubia]]n and [[Ethiopia]]n dynasties, also recorded their victories there. This main entrance to the temple complex was originally flanked by six colossal statues of Ramesses&nbsp;<U+2013> four seated, and two standing&nbsp;<U+2013> but only two (both seated) have survived. Modern visitors can also see a 25 meter (82&nbsp;ft) tall pink granite [[obelisk]]: this one of a matching pair until 1835, when the other one was taken to [[Paris]] where it now stands in the centre of the [[Place de la Concorde]].

Through the pylon gateway leads into a peristyle courtyard, also built by Ramesses II. This area, and the pylon, were built at an oblique angle to the rest of the temple, presumably to accommodate the three pre-existing barque shrines located in the northwest corner. After the peristyle courtyard comes the processional colonnade built by Amenhotep III&nbsp;<U+2013> a 100 meter (328&nbsp;ft) corridor lined by 14 [[papyrus]]-[[capital (architecture)|capital]] columns. Friezes on the wall describe the stages in the Opet Festival, from sacrifices at Karnak at the top left, through [[Amun]]'s arrival at Luxor at the end of that wall, and concluding with his return on the opposite side. The decorations were put in place by Tutankhamun: the boy pharaoh is depicted, but his names have been replaced with those of Horemheb.

Beyond the colonnade is a peristyle courtyard, which also dates back to Amenhotep's original construction. The best preserved columns are on the eastern side, where some traces of original color can be seen. The southern side of this courtyard is made up of a 36-column hypostyle court that leads into the dark inner rooms of the temple.
