During "The Champ" from 2006's ''[[Fishscale]]'', [[Ghostface Killah]] asks "Y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy/Wonderin' how'd y'all niggas get past me?" Ghostface had mocked the "snap dance" during his 2005 tour.<ref>[http://www.perfectpeople.net/biography/2949/ghostface-killah.htm] {{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> There has also been controversy on who wrote "Laffy Taffy".
