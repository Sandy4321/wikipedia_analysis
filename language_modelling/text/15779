{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Roman mythology]], '''Ceres''' is the [[goddess]] of growing plants (particularly [[cereal]]s) and of motherly love. Ceres was worshipped in [[Ancient Roman religion]], and is today still worshipped in [[Nova Roma|Religio Romana Neopaganism]]. Ceres was usually equated with the Greek goddess [[Demeter]]. 

==Etymology==
Her name may derive from the hypothetical [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root "ker", meaning "to grow", which is also the root for the words "create" and "increase".

==Myth==
Ceres was the daughter of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and [[Ops]], wife-sister of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], mother of [[Proserpina]] by Jupiter and sister of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. Works of art depicted Ceres conventionally with a [[scepter]], a basket of [[flower]]s and [[fruit]], and a [[garland]] made of [[wheat|corn]] ears (note that "corn" in this instance refers to [[wheat]], [[barley]], or some other old world food grain, not to the new world food grain [[maize]], which is called "corn" in the United States and some other areas of the [[Western hemisphere]]).

Ceres was also patron of [[Enna]], [[Sicily]]. According to legend, she begged Jupiter that Sicily be placed in the heavens. The result, because the island is triangular in shape, was the constellation [[Triangulum]], an early name of which was ''Sicilia''.

Ceres made up a trinity with Liber and Libera, who were two other agricultural gods. She also had twelve minor gods who assisted her, and were in charge of specific aspects of farming: "Vervactor who turns fallow land, Reparator who prepares fallow land, Imporcitor who plows with wide furrows" (whose name comes from the Latin ''imporcare'', to put into furrows), "Insitor who sowed, Obarator who plowed the surface, Occator who harrowed, Sarritor who weeded, Subruncinator who thinned out, Messor who harvested, Conuector who carted, Conditor who stored, and Promitor who distributed".[http://students.roanoke.edu/groups/relg211/ashby/Ceres.html]

==Worship==

The Romans adopted Ceres in [[496 BC]] during a devastating famine, when the [[Sibylline books]] advised the adoption of her [[Greek mythology|Greek]] equivalent [[Demeter]], along with [[Persephone|Kore]] (Persephone) and [[Iacchus]] (possibly [[Dionysus]]). Ceres was personified and celebrated by women in secret rituals at the festival of [[Ambarvalia]], held during May. There was a [[temple]] to Ceres on the [[Aventine Hill]] in [[Rome]] and her official priest was called a flamen. Her primary festival was the [[Cerealia]] or ''Ludi Ceriales'' ("games of Ceres"), instituted in the [[3rd century BC]] and held annually on [[April 12]] to [[April 19]]. The worship of Ceres became particularly associated with the [[plebeian]] classes, who dominated the grain trade. Little is known about the rituals of Cerelean worship; one of the few customs which has been recorded was the peculiar practice of tying lighted brands to the tails of foxes which were then let loose in the [[Circus Maximus]]. There was also an October festival dedicated to her when women fasted and offered her the first grain of the harvest.

==Legacy==
The word [[cereal]]s derives from Ceres, commemorating her association with edible grains. Statues of Ceres top the domes of the [[Missouri State Capitol]] and the [[Vermont State House]] serving as a reminder of the importance of agriculture in the states' economies and histories. There is also a statue of her on top of the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], which conducts trading in agricultural commodities.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (discovered 1801), is named after this goddess. And in turn, the chemical element [[cerium]] (discovered 1803) was named after the dwarf planet. A poem about Ceres and humanity features in Dmitri's confession to his brother Alexei in Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', Part 1, Book 3, Chapter 3.
