Shiva is usually worshiped in  the [[aniconic]] form of [[Lingam]].<ref name=Davis_worship>Davis writes on page 122: "The Saiva worshipper does not worship the object itself as Siva or as representing Siva; he directs his worship toward it as the physical support for Siva's special presence."</ref><ref name="Fowler">Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, by Jeanne Fowler, pgs. 42<U+2013>43, In traditional Indian society, the linga is rather seen as a symbol of the energy and potentiality of the God.</ref><ref name=Fuller>See Fuller, The Camphor Flame, pp 58.</ref> Shiva of the highest level is limitless, transcendent, unchanging and formless.<ref name=Shaivism_enc>See Parmeshwaranand, Volume 3.</ref><ref name=Stella_param>See Kramrisch, The presence of Siva, page 186.</ref><ref name=Abhay>See Abhayananda, page 95.</ref><ref name=Davis_param>See Davis, pp 113-114.</ref><ref name=Chatterji>Chatterji, Kashmir Shaivism.</ref> However, Shiva also has many benevolent and fearsome forms.<ref name=SharmaBN>Sharma, Iconography of Sadasiva</ref> In benevolent aspects, he is depicted as an omniscient [[Yogi]] who lives an ascetic life on [[Mount Kailash]],<ref name="Zimmer 1972 p. 124"/> as well as a householder with wife [[Parvati]] and two sons, [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]] or as the [[Nataraja|Cosmic Dancer]]. In fierce aspects, he is often depicted slaying demons. The most recognizable iconographical attributes of the god are a third eye on his forehead, a snake around his neck, the crescent [[moon]] adorning and the river [[Ganga]] flowing from his matted hair, the [[trishula]] as his weapon and the [[damaru]] as his instrument.

Shiva as we know him today shares features with the Vedic god [[Rudra]]. Historians have also suggested that worship of Shiva existed in pre-Vedic times, but not all historians agree on this.

== Etymology and other names ==
{{Main|List of titles and names of Shiva}}
The Sanskrit word ''Shiva'' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|<U+0936><U+093F><U+0935>}}, ''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva}}'') comes from [[Shri Rudram Chamakam]] of [[Taittiriya]] Samhita (TS 4.5, 4.7) of [[Yajurveda|Krishna Yajurveda]]. The root word {{IAST|<U+015B>i}}<ref>http://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=%C5%9Bi&lang=&iencoding=&action=Search</ref> means auspicious. In simple English transliteration it is written either as ''Shiva'' or ''Siva''. The adjective ''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva}}'', is used as an attributive epithet not particularly of Rudra, but of several other [[Vedic]] deities.<ref>For use of the term ''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva}}'' as an epithet for other Vedic deities, see: Chakravarti, p. 28.</ref>

The other popular names associated with Shiva are Mahadev, Mahesh, Maheshwar, Shankar, Shambhu, Rudra, Har, Trilochan, Devendra (meaning Chief of the Gods) and Trilokinath (meaning ''Lord of the three realms'').<ref name=Manmatha>See translation by Manmatha Nath Dutt, Chapter 17 of Volume 13.</ref><ref name=Kisari>See translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Chapter 17 of Volume 13.</ref><ref name=Chidbhav>See Chidbhavananda, "Siva Sahasranama Stotram".</ref>

The Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|<U+015B>aiva}}'' means "relating to the god Shiva", and this term is the Sanskrit name both for one of the principal sects of Hinduism and for a member of that sect.<ref>Apte, p. 927</ref> It is used as an adjective to characterize certain beliefs and practices, such as [[Shaivism]].<ref>For the definition "<U+015A>aivism refers to the traditions which follow the teachings of {{IAST|<U+015A>iva}} (''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva<U+015B><U+0101>na}}'') and which focus on the deity {{IAST|<U+015A>iva}}... " see: Flood (1996), p. 149.</ref> He is the oldest worshipped Lord of India.

The Tamil word ''Sivan'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: {{lang|ta|<U+0B9A><U+0BBF><U+0BB5><U+0BA9><U+0BCD>}} ("Fair Skinned") could have been derived from the word ''sivappu''. The word 'sivappu' means "red" in [[Tamil language]] but while addressing a person's skin texture in Tamil the word 'Sivappu' is used for being Fair Skinned.<ref>''Tantra: The Cult of the Feminine'', p. 213.</ref><ref>''Shaivism in Ancient India: From the Earliest Times to C.A.D. 300'' (1982)</ref>

[[Adi Sankara]], in his interpretation of the name ''Shiva'', the 27th and 600th name of [[Vishnu sahasranama]], the thousand names of Vishnu interprets ''Shiva'' to have multiple meanings: "The Pure One", or "the One who is not affected by three [[Gunas]] of [[Prakrti]] ([[Sattva]], [[Rajas]], and [[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]])" or "the One who purifies everyone by the very utterance of His name."<ref>Sri Vishnu Sahasranama, Ramakrishna Math edition, pg.47 and pg. 122.</ref> [[Swami Chinmayananda]], in his translation of Vishnu sahasranama, further elaborates on that verse: ''Shiva'' means "the One who is eternally pure" or "the One who can never have any contamination of the imperfection of Rajas and Tamas".<ref>Swami Chinmayananda's translation of Vishnu sahasranama, pg. 24, Central Chinmaya Mission Trust.</ref>

Shiva's role as the primary deity of Shaivism is reflected in his epithets ''{{IAST|Mah<U+0101>deva}}'' ("Great God"; ''{{IAST|mah<U+0101>}}'' "Great" and ''deva'' "god"),<ref>Kramrisch, p. 476.</ref><ref>For appearance of the name {{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+0939><U+093E><U+0926><U+0947><U+0935>}} in the ''Shiva Sahasranama'' see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=297}}</ref> ''{{IAST|Mahe<U+015B>vara}}'' ("Great Lord"; ''{{IAST|mah<U+0101>}}'' "great" and ''{{IAST|<U+012B><U+015B>vara}}'' "lord"),<ref>Kramrisch, p. 477.</ref><ref>For appearance of the name {{lang|sa|<U+092E><U+0939><U+0947><U+0936><U+094D><U+0935><U+0930>}} in the Shiva Sahasranama see:{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=299}}</ref> and ''[[Parameshwara (God)|{{IAST|Parame<U+015B>vara}}]]'' ("Supreme Lord").<ref>For {{IAST|Parame<U+015B>hvara}} as "Supreme Lord" see: Kramrisch, p. 479.</ref>

There are at least eight different versions of the ''[[Shiva Sahasranama]]'', devotional hymns (stotras) listing many names of Shiva.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=viii-ix}}</ref> The version appearing in Book 13 ({{IAST|Anu<U+015B><U+0101>sanaparvan}}) of the [[Mahabharata]] is considered the kernel of this tradition.<ref>This is the source for the version presented in Chidbhavananda, who refers to it being from the Mahabharata but does not explicitly clairify which of the two Mahabharata versions he is using. See Chidbhavananda, p.5.</ref> Shiva also has Dasha-Sahasranamas (10,000 names) that are found in the Mahanyasa. The [[Shri Rudram Chamakam]], also known as the ''<U+015A>atarudriya'', is a devotional hymn to Shiva hailing him by many names.<ref>For an overview of the ''<U+015A>atarudriya'' see: Kramrisch, pp. 71-74.</ref><ref>For complete Sanskrit text, translations, and commentary see: Sivaramamurti (1976).</ref>

== Historical development and literature==
The worship of Shiva is a pan-Hindu tradition, practiced widely across all of India, [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]].{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=17}}<ref name="Keayxxvii">Keay, p.xxvii.</ref> Some historians believe that the figure of Shiva as we know him today was built up over time, with the ideas of many regional sects being amalgamated into a single figure.<ref name="Keayxxvii" /> How the persona of Shiva converged as a composite deity is not well documented.<ref>For Shiva as a composite deity whose history is not well documented, see: Keay, p. 147.</ref> [[Axel Michaels]] the Indologist suggests [[Shaivism]] like [[Vaishnavism|Vai<U+1E63><U+1E47>avism]], implies a unity which cannot be clearly found either in religious practice or in philosophical and esoteric doctrine. Furthermore, practice and doctrine must be kept separate.<ref>Michaels, p. 215.</ref>

An example of assimilation took place in [[Maharashtra]], where a regional deity named [[Khandoba]] is a patron deity of farming and herding [[caste]]s.<ref name="Courtright, p. 205">Courtright, p. 205.</ref> The foremost center of worship of Khandoba in Maharashtra is in [[Jejuri]].<ref>For Jejuri as the foremost center of worship see: Mate, p. 162.</ref> Khandoba has been assimilated as a form of Shiva himself,<ref>'Khandoba: Ursprung, Geschiche und Umvelt von Pastoralem Gotheiten in Maharashtra, Wiesbaden 1976 (German with English Synopsis) pp. 180-98, "Khandoba is a local deity in Maharashtra and been Sanskritised as an incarnation of Shiva."</ref> in which case he is worshipped in the form of a [[lingam]].<ref name="Courtright, p. 205"/><ref>For worship of Khandoba in the form of a lingam and possible identification with Shiva based on that, see: Mate, p. 176.</ref> Khandoba's varied associations also include an identification with [[Surya]]<ref name="Courtright, p. 205"/> and [[Karttikeya]].<ref>For use of the name Khandoba as a name for Karttikeya in Maharashtra, see: Gupta, ''Preface'', and p. 40.</ref>

=== The Pashupati seal ===
[[File:Shiva Pashupati.jpg|upright|thumb|Seal discovered during excavation of the Mohenjodaro archaeological site in the Indus Valley has drawn attention as a possible representation of a "yogi" or "proto-Shiva" figure]]

Many Indus valley seals show animals. One seal that has attracted attention shows a figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly [[ithyphallic]].<ref name="Figure 1 1996 p. 29">For a drawing of the seal see Figure 1 ''in'': Flood (1996), p. 29.</ref><ref>Singh, S.P., ''Rgvedic Base of the Pasupati Seal of Mohenjo-Daro'', Puratattva 19: 19-26. 1989</ref><ref>Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark. ''Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization''. Karachi: Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref> figure seated in a posture reminiscent of the [[Lotus position]] and surrounded by animals was named by early excavators of [[Mohenjodaro|Mohenjo-daro]]''[[Pashupati]]'' (lord of cattle), an epithet of the later [[Hinduism|Hindu]] gods Shiva and [[Rudra]].<ref name="Figure 1 1996 p. 29"/><ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of India: A Historical Survey| author = Ranbir Vohra| publisher = M.E. Sharpe| year = 2000| page = 15}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = Ancient Indian Civilization| author = Grigori<U+012D> Maksimovich Bongard-Levin| publisher = Arnold-Heinemann| year = 1985| page = 45}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = Essential Hinduism| author = Steven Rosen, Graham M. Schweig| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 2006| page = 45}}</ref>[[Sir John Marshall]] and others have claimed that this figure is a prototype of Shiva and have described the figure as having three faces seated in a "yoga posture" with the knees out and feet joined. However, this claim is not without its share of critics, with some academics like [[Gavin Flood]]{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=28-29}}{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204-205}} and [[John Keay]] characterizing them as unfounded.<ref>Keay, p. 14.</ref>

Writing in 1997 [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] said that "Not too many recent studies continue to call the seal's figure a "Proto-Siva," rejecting thereby Marshall's package of proto-Siva features, including that of three heads. She interprets what [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]] interpreted as facial as not human but more bovine, possibly a divine buffalo-man.<ref>{{cite book|last=Srinivasan|first=Doris Meth|title=Many Heads, Arms and Eyes: Origin, Meaning and Form in Multiplicity in Indian Art|year=1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004107588}}</ref> According to [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] symbols 47 and 48 of his Indus script glossary ''The Indus Script: Texts, Concordance and Tables'' (1977), representing seated human-like figures, could describe Hindu deity [[Murugan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Mahadevan|first=Iravatham|title=A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery|year=2006|publisher=harappa.com|url=http://www.harappa.com/arrow/stone_celt_indus_signs.html}}</ref>

According to [[Rita P. Wright]]: <blockquote> Several lines of evidence have been used to identify depictions of gods, goddesses , and animals as symbols of practices known from historic South Asian religions, principally Buddhism and Hinduism. The figurines and narratives depicted on seals continue to be central to arguments for and against these interpretations. Their direct relationship to modern South Asian religions remains ambiguous in view of the great time depth between the last vestiges of the Indus civilization and the emergence of Hinduism and Buddhism in the mid to late first millennium B. C. Even if later religions were to have borrowed and/or revived imagery from the Indus culture, the meanings attached to them are unlikely to have remained the same, since meanings inherent in borrowed images typically are transformed in a new cultural context.{{Sfn|Wright|2010|pp=281&ndash;282}}</blockquote>
There are no religious buildings or evidence of elaborate burials. If there were temples, they have not been identified.<ref>Thapar, Romila, Early India: From the Origins to 1300, London, Penguin Books, 2002</ref> However, House - 1 in HR-A area in Mohenjadaro's Lower Town has been identified as a possible temple.<ref>McIntosh, Jane. (2008) The Ancient Indus Valley : New Perspectives. ABC-CLIO. Page 84,276</ref>

===In the Vedas===
Shiva's rise to a major position in the pantheon was facilitated by his identification with a host of Vedic deities, including [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Prajapati|{{IAST|Praj<U+0101>pati}}]], [[Vayu|{{IAST|V<U+0101>yu}}]], and others.<ref>For Shiva being identified with Agni, Indra, Praj<U+0101>pati, V<U+0101>yu, and others see: Chakravarti, p. 70.</ref>

====Rudra====
{{Main|Rudra}}
[[File:ThreeHeadedShivaGandhara2ndCentury.jpg|upright|thumb|Three-headed Shiva, Gandhara, 2nd century CE]]
Shiva as we know him today shares many features with the Vedic god [[Rudra]],<ref name="Michaels, p. 316">Michaels, p. 316.</ref> and both Shiva and Rudra are viewed as the same personality in Hindu scriptures. The two names are used synonymously. Rudra, the god of the roaring [[storm]], is usually portrayed in accordance with the element he represents as a fierce, destructive deity.

The oldest surviving text of Hinduism is the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], which is dated to between 1700 and 1100 BC based on [[Linguistics|linguistic]] and [[philology|philological]] evidence.<ref>For dating based on "cumulative evidence" see: Oberlies, p. 158.</ref> A god named [[Rudra]] is mentioned in the Rig Veda. The name Rudra is still used as a name for Shiva. In RV 2.33, he is described as the "Father of the [[Rudras]]", a group of storm gods.<ref>Doniger, pp. 221-223.</ref> Furthermore, the [[Shri Rudram Chamakam|Rudram]], one of the most sacred hymns of Hinduism found both in the Rig and the Yajur Vedas and addressed to Rudra, invokes him as Shiva in several instances, but the term ''Shiva'' is used as an epithet for the gods [[Indra]], [[Mitra]] and [[Agni]] many times. Since ''Shiva'' means ''pure'', the epithet is possibly used to describe a quality of these gods rather than to identify any of them with the God Shiva.

The identification of Shiva with the older god Rudra is not universally accepted, as Axel Michaels explains:
{{quote|Rudra is called "The Archer" (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|<U+015A>arva}}''),<ref>For {{IAST|<U+015A>arva}} as a name of Shiva see: Apte, p. 910.</ref> and the arrow is an essential attribute of Rudra.<ref>For archer and arrow associations see Kramrisch, Chapter 2, and for the arrow as an "essential attribute" see: Kramrisch, p. 32.</ref> This name appears in the Shiva Sahasranama, and R. K. Sharma notes that it is used as a name of Shiva often in later languages.<ref name="Sharma 1996 p=306">{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=306}}</ref>}}

The word is derived from the Sanskrit root ''{{IAST|<U+015B>arv}}-'', which means "to injure" or "to kill",<ref>For root ''{{IAST|<U+015B>arv}}-'' see: Apte, p. 910.</ref> and Sharma uses that general sense in his interpretive translation of the name {{IAST|<U+015A>arva}} as "One who can kill the forces of darkness".<ref name="Sharma 1996 p=306"/> The names {{IAST|Dhanvin}} ("Bowman")<ref name="Chidbhavananda, p. 33">Chidbhavananda, p. 33.</ref> and {{IAST|B<U+0101><U+1E47>ahasta}} ("Archer", literally "Armed with arrows in his hands")<ref name="Chidbhavananda, p. 33"/><ref>For translation of {{IAST|B<U+0101><U+1E47>ahasta}} as "Armed with arrows in his hands", see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=294}}.</ref> also refer to archery.

==== Agni ====
Rudra and Agni have a close relationship.<ref>For general statement of the close relationship, and example shared epithets, see: Sivaramamurti, p. 11.</ref><ref>For an overview of the Rudra-Fire complex of ideas, see: Kramrisch, pp. 15-19.</ref> The identification between Agni and Rudra in the Vedic literature was an important factor in the process of Rudra's gradual development into the later character as Rudra-Shiva.<ref>For quotation "An important factor in the process of Rudra's growth is his identification with Agni in the Vedic literature and this identification contributed much to the transformation of his character as {{IAST|Rudra-<U+015A>iva}}." see: Chakravarti, p. 17.</ref> The identification of Agni with Rudra is explicitly noted in the ''[[Nirukta]]'', an important early text on etymology, which says, "Agni is also called Rudra."<ref>For translation from ''Nirukta'' 10.7, see: Sarup (1927), p. 155.</ref>  The interconnections between the two deities are complex, and according to Stella Kramrisch:
{{quote|The fire myth of {{IAST|Rudra-<U+015A>iva}} plays on the whole gamut of fire, valuing all its potentialities and phases, from conflagration to illumination.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 18.</ref>}}

In the [[Shri Rudram Chamakam|''<U+015A>atarudr<U+012B>ya'']], some epithets of Rudra, such as {{IAST|Sasipa<U+00F1>jara}} ("Of golden red hue as of flame") and {{IAST|Tiva<U+1E63><U+012B>mati}} ("Flaming bright"), suggest a fusing of the two deities.<ref>For "Note Agni-Rudra concept fused" in epithets {{IAST|Sasipa<U+00F1>jara}} and {{IAST|Tiva<U+1E63><U+012B>mati}} see: Sivaramamurti, p. 45.</ref> Agni is said to be a bull,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv06048.htm |title=Rig Veda: Rig-Veda, Book 6: HYMN XLVIII. Agni and Others |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> and Lord Shiva possesses a bull as his vehicle, [[Nandi bull|Nandi]]. The horns of Agni, who is sometimes characterized as a bull, are mentioned.<ref>For the parallel between the horns of Agni as bull, and Rudra, see: Chakravarti, p. 89.</ref><ref>RV 8.49; 10.155.</ref> In medieval sculpture, both Agni and the form of Shiva known as Bhairava have flaming hair as a special feature.<ref>For flaming hair of Agni and Bhairava see: Sivaramamurti, p. 11.</ref>

==== Indra ====
According to a theory, the Puranic Shiva is a continuation of the Vedic [[Indra]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Doniger|first=Wendy|authorlink=Wendy Doniger|title=<U+015A>iva, the erotic ascetic|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press US|pages=84<U+2013>9|chapter = The Vedic Antecedents }}</ref> He gives several reasons for his hypothesis. Both Shiva and Indra are known for having a thirst for [[Soma]]. Both are associated with mountains, rivers, male fertility, fierceness, fearlessness, warfare, transgression of established mores, the [[Aum]] sound, the Supreme Self. In the Rig Veda the term ''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva}}'' is used to refer to Indra.

=== Later Vedic literature===
Rudra's transformation from an ambiguously characterized deity to a supreme being began in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (400-200 BCE), which founded the tradition of Rudra-Shiva worship. Here they are identified as the creators of the cosmos and [[moksha|liberators of souls]] from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BCE to 100 CE also marks the beginning of the [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] tradition focused on the worship of Shiva, with references to Shaiva ascetics in [[Patanjali]]'s [[Mahabhasya]] and in the [[Mahabharata]].{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=204-205}}{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=86}}

===Tantric literature===
The [[Tantras]], composed between the 8th and 11th centuries, regard themselves as [[Sruti]]. Among these the [[<U+0100>gama (Hinduism)#Saiva Agamas|Shaiva Agamas]], are said to have been revealed by Shiva himself and are foundational texts for [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].{{sfn|Flood|2003|pp=208-212}}

=== Shaivism ===
{{Main|Shaivism|History of Shaivism}}

Shaivism ({{lang-sa|<U+0936><U+0948><U+0935> <U+092A><U+0902><U+0925>}}, ''<U+015B>aiva pa<U+1E41>tha'') ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: [[:ta:<U+0BA4><U+0BAE><U+0BBF><U+0BB4><U+0BCD>|<U+0B9A><U+0BC8><U+0BB5> <U+0B9A><U+0BAE><U+0BAF><U+0BAE><U+0BCD>]]) is the oldest of the four major sects of [[Hinduism]], the others being [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Smartism]]. Followers of Shaivism, called "Shaivas", and also "Saivas" or "Saivites", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shaivas believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. The [[Tantra|tantric]] Shaiva tradition consists of the [[Kapalikas]], [[Kashmir Shaivism]] and [[Shaiva Siddhanta]]. The [[Shiva Purana|Shiva MahaPurana]] is one of the {{IAST|[[Puranas|pur<U+0101><U+1E47>a]]}}s, a genre of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious texts, dedicated to Shiva. Shaivism is widespread throughout India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, mostly. Areas notable for the practice of Shaivism include parts of Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia.

===Panchayatana puja===
{{Main|Panchayatana puja}}

Panchayatana puja is the system of [[Puja (Hinduism)|worship]] ('puja') in the [[Smarta]] [[sampradaya]] of [[Hinduism]]. It is said to have been introduced by [[Adi Shankara]], the 8th century [[Common Era|CE]] [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu philosopher]]. It consists of the worship of five deities: Shiva, [[Vishnu]], [[Devi]], [[Surya]] and [[Ganesha]]. Depending on the tradition followed by Smarta households, one of these deities is kept in the center and the other four surround it. Worship is offered to all the deities. The five are represented by small [[murtis]], or by five kinds of stones, or by five marks drawn on the floor.<ref name="lexicon">[http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/lexicon/ Himalaya Academy, ''Panchayatana puja'']</ref>

===Trimurti===
{{Main|Trimurti}}

The Trimurti is a concept in [[Hinduism]]{{quote|in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of [[Brahma|Brahm<U+0101>]] the creator, [[Vishnu]] the maintainer or preserver and <U+015A>hiva the destroyer or transformer,"<ref>For quotation defining the trimurti see Matchett, Freda.

==Iconography and properties==

=== Attributes ===
[[File:6 <U+015A>iva and P<U+0101>rvat<U+012B> seated on a terrace. 1800 (circa) BM.jpg|thumb|Shiva with [[Parvati]]. Shiva is depicted three-eyed, the [[Ganges]] flowing through his matted hair, wearing ornaments of serpents and a skull bracelet, and covered in ashes, and seated on a tiger skin.]]

* '''Shiva's form:''' Shiva has a Trident in the right lower arm, with a crescent moon on his head. He is said to be fair like camphor or like an ice clad mountain. He has fire and Damaru and Mala or a kind of weapon. He wears five serpents as ornaments. He wears a garland of skulls. He is pressing with his feet the demon Muyalaka, a dwarf holding a cobra. He faces south. Panchakshara itself is his body. (The trident, like almost all other forms in Hinduism, can be understood as the symbolism of the unity of three worlds that a human faces - his inside world, his immediate world, and the broader overall world. At the base of the trident, all three forks unite.)

* '''Third eye:''' (Trilochana) Shiva is often depicted with a [[third eye]], with which he burned Desire ({{IAST|[[K<U+0101>ma]]}}) to ashes,<ref>For Shiva as depicted with a third eye, and mention of the story of the destruction of Kama with it, see: Flood (1996), p. 151.</ref> called "Tryambakam" (Sanskrit: ''<U+0924><U+094D><U+0930><U+094D><U+092F><U+092E><U+094D><U+092C><U+0915><U+092E><U+094D> ''), which occurs in many scriptural sources.<ref>For a review of 4 theories about the meaning of ''tryambaka'', see: Chakravarti, pp. 37-39.</ref> In classical Sanskrit, the word ''ambaka'' denotes "an eye", and in the ''Mahabharata'', Shiva is depicted as three-eyed, so this name is sometimes translated as "having three eyes".<ref>For usage of the word ''ambaka'' in classical Sanskrit and connection to the Mahabharata depiction, see: Chakravarti, pp. 38-39.</ref> However, in Vedic Sanskrit, the word ''{{IAST|amb<U+0101>}}'' or ''{{IAST|ambik<U+0101>}}'' means "mother", and this early meaning of the word is the basis for the translation "three mothers".<ref>For translation of Tryambakam as "having three mother eyes" and as an epithet of Rudra, see: Kramrisch, p. 483.</ref><ref>For vedic Sanskrit meaning Lord has three mother eyes which symbolize eyes are the Sun, Moon and Fire.</ref> These three mother-goddesses who are collectively called the {{IAST|Ambik<U+0101>s}}.<ref>For discussion of the problems in translation of this name, and the hypothesis regarding the {{IAST|Ambik<U+0101>s}} see: Hopkins (1968), p. 220.</ref> Other related translations have been based on the idea that the name actually refers to the oblations given to Rudra, which according to some traditions were shared with the goddess {{IAST|Ambik<U+0101>}}.<ref>For the {{IAST|Ambik<U+0101>}} variant, see: Chakravarti, pp. 17, 37.</ref> It has been mentioned that when Shiva loses his temper badly, his third eye opens which can destroy most of the things to ashes.

* '''Crescent moon:''' (The epithets "Chandrasekhara/Chandramouli")- Shiva bears on his head the crescent moon.<ref>For the moon on the forehead see: Chakravarti, p. 109.</ref> The epithet {{IAST|Candra<U+015B>ekhara}} (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|<U+091A><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+094D><U+0930><U+0936><U+0947><U+0916><U+0930>}} "Having the moon as his crest" - ''[[chandra|{{IAST|candra}}]]'' = "moon"; ''{{IAST|<U+015B>ekhara}}'' = "crest, crown")<ref>For ''{{IAST|<U+015B>ekhara}}'' as crest or crown, see: Apte, p. 926.</ref><ref>For {{IAST|Candra<U+015B>ekhara}} as an iconographic form, see: Sivaramamurti (1976), p. 56.</ref><ref>For translation "Having the moon as his crest" see: Kramrisch, p. 472.</ref> refers to this feature. The placement of the moon on his head as a standard iconographic feature dates to the period when Rudra rose to prominence and became the major deity Rudra-Shiva.<ref>For the moon iconography as marking the rise of Rudra-Shiva, see: Chakravarti, p. 58.</ref> The origin of this linkage may be due to the identification of the moon with [[Soma]], and there is a hymn in the Rig Veda where Soma and Rudra are jointly implored, and in later literature, Soma and Rudra came to be identified with one another, as were Soma and the moon.<ref>For discussion of the linkages between Soma, Moon, and Rudra, and citation to RV 7.74, see: Chakravarti, pp. 57-58.</ref> The crescent moon is shown on the side of the Lord's head as an ornament. The waxing and waning phenomenon of the moon symbolizes the time cycle through which creation evolves from the beginning to the end. Since the Lord is the Eternal Reality, He is beyond time. Thus, the crescent moon is only one of His ornaments. The wearing of the crescent moon in his head indicates that He has controlled the mind perfectly.

* '''Ashes:''' (The epithet "Bhasmaanga Raaga") - Shiva smears his body with ashes ([[bhasma]]). Ashes represent the final reality that a human being will face - the end of all material existence.<ref name="Flood 1996, p. 151">Flood (1996), p. 151.</ref> Some forms of Shiva, such as Bhairava, are associated with a very old Indian tradition of cremation-ground asceticism that was practiced by some groups who were outside the fold of brahmanic orthodoxy.<ref>Flood (1996), pp. 92, 161.</ref> These practices associated with cremation grounds are also mentioned in the Pali canon of Theravada Buddhism.<ref>Flood (1996), p. 161.</ref> One epithet for Shiva is "inhabitant of the cremation ground" (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|<U+015B>ma<U+015B><U+0101>nav<U+0101>sin}}'', also spelled ''Shmashanavasin''), referring to this connection.<ref>Chidbhavananda, p. 23.</ref> It is interesting to see the peaceful acceptance of cremation ground temples of ''Batuk Bhairava'', a form of Lord Shiva, by the general populace. At Ujjain, near the ''Kaal Bhairava'' temple lies such a cremation ground temple of ''Batuk Bhairava'', with its legendary disciple Baba Dabral known throughout Central India (as he is blessed, people say, with the ability to literally read out incidents of the future in one's life just by holding one's palm).

* '''Matted hair:''' (The epithet "Jataajoota Dhari/Kapardina") - Shiva's distinctive hair style is noted in the epithets {{IAST|Ja<U+1E6D>in}}, "the one with matted hair",<ref>Chidbhavananda, p. 22.</ref> and Kapardin, "endowed with matted hair"<ref>For translation of Kapardin as "Endowed with matted hair" see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=279}}.</ref> or "wearing his hair wound in a braid in a shell-like (kaparda) fashion".<ref>Kramrisch, p. 475.</ref>  A kaparda is a cowrie shell, or a braid of hair in the form of a shell, or, more generally, hair that is shaggy or curly.<ref>For Kapardin as a name of Shiva, and description of the kaparda hair style, see, Macdonell, p. 62.</ref> His hair is said to be like molten gold in color or being yellowish-white.

* '''Blue throat:''' The epithet {{IAST|N<U+012B>laka<U+1E47>tha}} (Sanskrit {{lang|sa|<U+0928><U+0940><U+0932><U+0915><U+0923><U+094D><U+0920>}}; ''n<U+012B>la'' = "blue", ''{{IAST|ka<U+1E47>tha}}'' = "throat")<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=290}}</ref><ref>See: name #93 in Chidbhavananda, p. 31.</ref> since Shiva drank the [[Halahala]] poison churned up from the Samudra Manthan to eliminate its destructive capacity. Shocked by his act, Goddess Parvati strangled his neck and hence managed to stop it in his neck itself and prevent it from spreading all over the universe supposed to be in Shiva's stomach. However the poison was so potent that it changed the color of his neck to blue.<ref>For Shiva drinking the poison churned from the world ocean see: Flood (1996), p. 78.</ref><ref name="Kramrisch, p. 473">Kramrisch, p. 473.</ref> (See [[Maha Shivaratri]].)

[[File:Gangadhara.jpg|thumb|right|Shiva bearing the descent of the Ganges River as Parvati and Bhagiratha and the bull Nandi look, folio from a Hindi manuscript by the Narayan, circa 1740]]

* '''Sacred Ganges:''' (The epithet "Gangadhara") Bearer of Ganga. [[Ganges]] river flows from the matted hair of Shiva.<ref>For alternate stories about this feature, and use of the name {{IAST|Ga<U+1E45>g<U+0101>dhara}} see: Chakravarti, pp. 59 and 109.</ref><ref>For description of the {{IAST|Ga<U+1E45>g<U+0101>dhara}} form, see: Sivaramamurti (1976), p. 8.</ref> The ''{{IAST|Ga<U+1E45>g<U+0101>}}'' (Ganges), one of the major rivers of the country, is said to have made her abode in Shiva's hair.<ref>For Shiva supporting {{IAST|Ga<U+1E45>g<U+0101>}} upon his head, see: Kramrisch, p. 473.</ref> The flow of the Ganges also represents the nectar of immortality.

* '''Tiger skin:''' (The epithet "Krittivasana").He is often shown seated upon a tiger skin,<ref name="Flood 1996, p. 151"/> an honour reserved for the most accomplished of Hindu ascetics, the Brahmarishis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamilstar.com/mythology/brahmarishis |title=Mythology ~ The birth of Brahmarishis|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> Tiger represents lust. His sitting on the tiger<U+2019>s skin indicates that He has conquered lust.

* '''Serpents:''' (The epithet "Nagendra Haara"). Shiva is often shown garlanded with a [[N<U+0101>ga|snake]].<ref>Flood (1996), p. 151</ref> His wearing of serpents on the neck denotes wisdom and eternity.

* '''Deer:''' His holding deer on one hand indicates that He has removed the Chanchalata of the mind (i.e., attained maturity and firmness in thought process). Deer jump from one place to another swiftly, similar to the mind moving from one thought to another.

* '''Trident:''' (Sanskrit: ''[[Trishula]]''): Shiva's particular weapon is the [[trident]].<ref name="Flood 1996, p. 151"/> His Trisul that is held in His right hand represents the three Gunas<U+2014>Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. That is the emblem of sovereignty. He rules the world through these three Gunas. The Damaru in His left hand represents the Sabda Brahman. It represents OM from which all languages are formed. It is He who formed the Sanskrit language out of the Damaru sound.

* '''Drum:''' A small drum shaped like an hourglass is known as a ''[[damaru]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|<U+1E0D>amaru}}'').<ref>Michaels, p. 218.</ref><ref>For definition and shape, see: Apte, p. 461.</ref> This is one of the attributes of Shiva in his famous dancing representation<ref>Jansen, p. 44.</ref> known as [[Nataraja]]. A specific hand gesture ([[mudra]]) called ''{{IAST|<U+1E0D>amaru-hasta}}'' (Sanskrit for "{{IAST|<U+1E0D>amaru}}-hand") is used to hold the drum.<ref>Jansen, p. 25.</ref> This drum is particularly used as an emblem by members of the {{IAST|K<U+0101>p<U+0101>lika}} sect.<ref>For use by {{IAST|K<U+0101>p<U+0101>likas}}, see: Apte, p. 461.</ref>

*'''Axe:''' (Sanskrit: ''[[Parashu]]''):The parashu is the weapon of Lord Shiva who gave it to [[Parashurama]], sixth Avatar of Vishnu, whose name means "Rama with the axe" and also taught him its mastery.

* '''{{IAST|Nand<U+012B>}}''': (The epithet "Nandi Vaahana").[[Nandi (bull)|Nand<U+012B>]], also known as Nandin, is the name of the [[Bull (mythology)|bull]] that serves as Shiva's mount (Sanskrit: ''[[Vahana|{{IAST|v<U+0101>hana}}]]'').<ref>For a review of issues related to the evolution of the bull (Nandin) as Shiva's mount, see: Chakravarti, pp. 99-105.</ref><ref>For spelling of alternate proper names {{IAST|Nand<U+012B>}} and Nandin see: Stutley, p. 98.</ref> Shiva's association with cattle is reflected in his name {{IAST|Pa<U+015B>upati}}, or [[Pashupati]] (Sanskrit: ''<U+092A><U+0936><U+0941><U+092A><U+0924><U+093F>''), translated by Sharma as "lord of cattle"<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=291}}</ref> and by Kramrisch as "lord of animals", who notes that it is particularly used as an epithet of Rudra.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 479.</ref> Rishabha or the bull represents Dharma Devata. Lord Siva rides on the bull. Bull is his vehicle. This denotes that Lord Siva is the protector of Dharma, is an embodiment of Dharma or righteousness.

* '''{{IAST|Ga<U+1E47>a}}''': The [[Gana|{{IAST|Ga<U+1E47>a}}s]] ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|<U+0917><U+0923>}}) are attendants of Shiva and live in [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]]. They are often referred to as the bhutaganas, or ghostly hosts, on account of their nature. Generally benign, except when their lord is transgressed against, they are often invoked to intercede with the lord on behalf of the devotee. [[Ganesha]] was chosen as their leader by Shiva, hence [[Ganesha]]'s title ''{{IAST|ga<U+1E47>a-<U+012B><U+015B>a}}'' or ''{{IAST|ga<U+1E47>a-pati}}'', "lord of the {{IAST|ga<U+1E47>as}}".<ref>[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]] (ISBN 0-500-51088-1) by Anna L. Dallapiccola</ref>

* '''Mount {{IAST|Kail<U+0101>sa}}''': [[Mount Kailash]] in the [[Himalayas]] is his traditional abode.<ref name="Flood 1996, p. 151"/> In Hindu mythology, Mount {{IAST|Kail<U+0101>sa}} is conceived as resembling a ''[[Linga]]'', representing the center of the universe.<ref>For identification of Mount {{IAST|Kail<U+0101>sa}} as the central ''linga'', see: Stutley (1985), p. 62.</ref>

* '''Varanasi''': [[Varanasi]] (Benares) is considered to be the city specially loved by Shiva, and is one of the holiest places of pilgrimage in India. It is referred to, in religious contexts, as Kashi.<ref>Keay, p. 33.</ref>

=== Lingam ===
[[File:Siva Lingam at Jambukesvara temple in Srirangam.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Lingam]] at Jambukesvara temple in [[Thiruvanaikaval]], [[Tamil Nadu]]]]
{{Main|Lingam}}
Apart from anthropomorphic images of Shiva, the worship of Shiva in the form of a ''[[lingam]]'', or ''linga'', is also important.<ref name="Michaels, p. 216">Michaels, p. 216.</ref><ref>Flood (1996), p. 29.</ref><ref>Tattwanandaz, pp. 49-52.</ref>  These are depicted in various forms.

====Jyotir Linga====
The worship of Shiva or Rudra can be dated back to the primitive worship of The Almighty. The people in these period used to worship the natural forces and represented The Almighty in the stones. The Linga worship could be a primitive form of idol worship. Gradually the culture may have been assimilated to the Ancient Aryan-Dravidian culture and there by to the Sanskrit literature.

The worship of the ''Shiva-Linga'' originated from the famous hymn in the ''Atharva-Veda Samhit<U+00E2>'' sung in praise of the ''Yupa-Stambha'', the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless ''[[Stambha]]'' or ''Skambha'', and it is shown that the said ''Skambha'' is put in place of the eternal [[Brahman]]. Just as the [[Yajna]] (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the ''[[Soma]]'' plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the [[Veda|Vedic]] sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the ''Yupa-Skambha'' gave place in time to the ''Shiva-Linga''.<ref name="E.U.Harding">{{cite book  | last = Harding  | first = Elizabeth U.  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Kali: The Black Goddess of Dakshineswar  | chapter = God, the Father  | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass  | year = 1998  | pages = 156<U+2013>157

The sacred of all Shiva linga is worshipped as Jyotir linga. Jyoti means Radiance, apart from relating Shiva [[linga]] as a phallus symbol, there are also arguments that Shiva linga means 'mark' or a 'sign'. The way of worship of primitive men by representing The Almighty on a stone. [[Jyotirlinga]] means '''The Radiant sign of The Almighty'''. The Jyotirlingas are mentioned in [[Shiva Purana]].<ref name="Shiva Purana">{{Citation

===Shakti===
[[File:Kali and Bhairava in Union.jpg|thumb|Kali and [[Bhairava]] (the terrible form of Shiva) in Union, 18th century, Nepal]]
{{Main|Shakti}}
Shiva forms a Tantric couple with [[Shakti]], the embodiment of energy, dynamism, and the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Shiva is her transcendent masculine aspect, providing the divine ground of all being. Shakti manifests in several female deities. [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]] and [[Parvati]] are the main consorts of Shiva, but she is also manifested as [[Uma (goddess)|Uma]], [[Durga]] (Parvata), [[Kali]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Why is Kali dancing on Lord Shiva?|publisher=The Chakra|url=http://www.chakranews.com/why-is-kali-dancing-on-lord-shiva/3742}}</ref> and [[Chandi]]ka.{{sfn|Bhattacharji|1998|p=26}} Kali is the manifestation of Shakti in her dreadful aspect. The name Kali comes from ''k<U+0101>la'', which means black, time, death, lord of death, Shiva. Since Shiva is called [[K<U+0101>la (time)|K<U+0101>la]],  the eternal time,  K<U+0101>l<U+012B>, his consort, also means "Time" or "Death" (as in "time has come"). Various [[Shakta]] Hindu cosmologies, as well as Sh<U+0101>kta [[Tantra|Tantric]] beliefs, worship her as the ultimate reality or ''[[Brahman]]''. She is also revered as Bhavat<U+0101>rini (literally "redeemer of the universe"). K<U+0101>l<U+012B> is represented as the consort of Lord Shiva, on whose body she is often seen standing or dancing. Shiva is the masculine force, the power of peace, while Shakti translates to power, and is considered as the feminine force. In the Vaishnava tradition, these realities are portrayed as Vishnu and Laxmi, or Radha and Krishna. These are differences in formulation rather than a fundamental difference in the principles. Both Shiva and Shakti have various forms. Shiva has forms like Yogi Raj (the common image of Himself meditating in the Himalayas), Rudra (a wrathful form) and Natarajar (Shiva's dance are the Lasya - the gentle form of dance, associated with the creation of the world, and the Tandava - the violent and dangerous dance, associated with the destruction of weary worldviews <U+2013> weary perspectives and lifestyles).

=== The five mantras ===
Five is a sacred number for Shiva.<ref>For five as a sacred number, see: Kramrisch, p. 182.</ref>  One of his most important mantras has five syllables ({{IAST|nama<U+1E25> <U+015B>iv<U+0101>ya}}).<ref>It is first encountered in an almost identical form in the Rudram. For the five syllable mantra see: Kramrisch, p. 182.</ref>

Shiva's body is said to consist of five mantras, called the {{IAST|pa<U+00F1>cabrahmans}}.<ref>For discussion of these five forms and a table summarizing the associations of these five mantras see: Kramrisch, pp. 182-189.</ref>  As forms of God, each of these have their own names and distinct iconography:<ref>For distinct iconography, see Kramrisch, p. 185.</ref>

* [[Sadyojata|{{IAST|Sadyoj<U+0101>ta}}]]
* [[Vamadeva|{{IAST|V<U+0101>madeva}}]]
* [[Bhairava|Aghora]]
* [[Tatpurusha|{{IAST|Tatpuru<U+1E63>ha}}]]
* [[Ishana|{{IAST|<U+012A>s<U+0101>na}}]]

These are represented as the five faces of Shiva and are associated in various texts with the five elements, the five senses, the five organs of perception, and the five organs of action.<ref>For association with the five faces and other groups of five, see: Kramrisch, p. 182.</ref><ref>For the epithets ''{{IAST|pa<U+00F1>camukha}}'' and ''{{IAST|pa<U+00F1>cavaktra}}'', both of which mean "five faces", as epithets of {{IAST|<U+015A>iva}}, see: Apte, p. 578, middle column.</ref>  Doctrinal differences and, possibly, errors in transmission, have resulted in some differences between texts in details of how these five forms are linked with various attributes.<ref>For variation in attributions among texts, see: Kramrisch, p. 187.</ref> The overall meaning of these associations is summarized by Stella Kramrisch:
{{quote|Through these transcendent categories, <U+015A>iva, the ultimate reality, becomes the efficient and material cause of all that exists.<ref>Kramrisch, p. 184.</ref>}}

According to the ''Pa<U+00F1>cabrahma Upanishad'':
{{quote|One should know all things of the phenomenal world as of a fivefold character, for the reason that the eternal verity of {{IAST|<U+015A>iva}} is of the character of the fivefold [[Brahman]]. (''Pa<U+00F1>cabrahma Upanishad'' 31)<ref>Quotation from ''Pa<U+00F1>cabrahma Upanishad'' 31 is from: Kramrisch, p. 182.</ref>}}

== Forms and roles ==
According to [[Gavin Flood]], "Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox," whose attributes include opposing themes.<ref>For quotation "Shiva is a god of ambiguity and paradox" and overview of conflicting attributes see: Flood (1996), p. 150.</ref>  The ambivalent nature of this deity is apparent in some of his names and the stories told about him.

=== Destroyer and Benefactor ===
In the [[Yajurveda]], two contrary sets of attributes for both malignant or terrific (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|rudra}}'') and benign or auspicious (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|<U+015B>iva}}'') forms can be found, leading Chakravarti to conclude that "all the basic elements which created the complex Rudra-<U+015A>iva sect of later ages are to be found here".<ref>For quotation regarding Yajur Veda as containing contrary sets of attributes, and marking point for emergence of all basic elements of later sect forms, see: Chakravarti, p. 7.</ref> In the Mahabharata, Shiva is depicted as "the standard of invincibility, might, and terror", as well as a figure of honor, delight, and brilliance.<ref>For summary of Shiva's contrasting depictions in the Mahabharata, see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1988|pp=20<U+2013>21}}.</ref> The duality of Shiva's fearful and auspicious attributes appears in contrasted names.

[[File:Uma maheswar.jpg|thumb|300px|Uma and Maheswar]]
The name ''[[Rudra]]'' (Sanskrit: ''<U+0930><U+0941><U+0926><U+094D><U+0930>'') reflects his fearsome aspects. According to traditional etymologies, the Sanskrit name ''Rudra'' is derived from the root ''rud-'', which means "to cry, howl".<ref>For ''rud-'' meaning "cry, howl" as a traditional etymology see: Kramrisch, p. 5.</ref> Stella Kramrisch notes a different etymology connected with the adjectival form ''raudra'', which means "wild, of ''rudra'' nature", and translates the name ''Rudra'' as "the wild one" or "the fierce god".<ref>Citation to M.

=== Ascetic and Householder ===
[[File:Shiva parivar.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of the family of Shiva, consisting of Shiva, [[Parvati]], [[Ganesha]] and [[Murugan|Skanda]] (Kartikeya)]]
He is depicted as both an ascetic [[yogi]] and as a householder, roles which have been traditionally mutually exclusive in Hindu society.<ref>For the contrast between ascetic and householder depictions, see: Flood (1996), pp. 150-151.</ref> When depicted as a yogi, he may be shown sitting and meditating.<ref>For Shiva's representation as a yogi, see: Chakravarti, p. 32.</ref>  His epithet Mah<U+0101>yogi ("the great [[Yoga|Yogi]]: ''{{IAST|Mah<U+0101>}}'' = "great", ''Yogi'' = "one who practices [[Yoga]]") refers to his association with yoga.<ref>For name Mah<U+0101>yogi and associations with yoga, see, Chakravarti, pp. 23, 32, 150.</ref> While [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] was conceived mainly in terms of sacrifice, it was during the [[Indian epic poetry|Epic period]] that the concepts of [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]], [[yoga]], and [[asceticism]] became more important, and the depiction of Shiva as an ascetic sitting in philosophical isolation reflects these later concepts.<ref>For the ascetic yogin form as reflecting Epic period influences, see: Chakravarti, p. 32.</ref> Shiva is also depicted as a corpse below Goddess [[Kali]], it represents that Shiva is a corpse without Shakti. He remains inert. While Shiva is the static form. [[Mahakali]] or [[Shakti]] is the dynamic aspect without whom Shiva is powerless.

As a family man and householder, he has a wife, [[Parvati]], and two sons, [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]]. His epithet {{IAST|Um<U+0101>pati}} ("The husband of {{IAST|Um<U+0101>}}") refers to this idea, and Sharma notes that two other variants of this name that mean the same thing, {{IAST|Um<U+0101>k<U+0101>nta}} and {{IAST|Um<U+0101>dhava}}, also appear in the sahasranama.<ref>For {{IAST|Um<U+0101>pati}}, {{IAST|Um<U+0101>k<U+0101>nta}} and {{IAST|Um<U+0101>dhava}} as names in the Shiva Sahasranama literature, see: {{Harvnb|Sharma|1996|p=278}}.</ref> {{IAST|Um<U+0101>}} in epic literature is known by many names, including the benign [[Parvati|{{IAST|P<U+0101>rvat<U+012B>}}]].<ref>For {{IAST|Um<U+0101>}} as the oldest name, and variants including {{IAST|P<U+0101>rvat<U+012B>}}, see: Chakravarti, p. 40.</ref><ref>For {{IAST|P<U+0101>rvat<U+012B>}} identified as the wife of Shiva, see: Kramrisch, p. 479.</ref> She is identified with [[Devi]], the Divine Mother; [[Shakti]] (divine energy) as well as goddesses like [[Tripura Sundari]], [[Durga]], [[Kamakshi]] and [[Meenakshi]].

=== Ardhanarishvara ===
{{Main|Ardhanarishvara}}[[File:Ardhanari.png|thumb|150px|upright|right|Chola bronze from the 11th century. Shiva in the form of [[Ardhanarisvara]].]]
An iconographic representation of Shiva called (''{{IAST|Ardhan<U+0101>r<U+012B><U+015B>vara}}'') shows him with one half of the body as male and the other half as female. According to Ellen Goldberg, the traditional Sanskrit name for this form (''{{IAST|Ardhan<U+0101>r<U+012B><U+015B>vara}}'') is best translated as "the lord who is half woman", not as "half-man, half-woman".<ref>Goldberg specifically rejects the translation by Frederique Marglin (1989) as "half-man, half-woman", and instead adopts the translation by Marglin as "the lord who is half woman" as given in Marglin (1989, 216). Goldberg, p. 1.</ref> According to legend, Lord Shiva is pleased by the difficult austerites performed by the Goddess Parvati, grants her the left half of his body. This form of Shiva is quite similar to the Yin-Yang philosophy of Eastern Asia, though ''{{IAST|Ardhan<U+0101>r<U+012B><U+015B>vara}}'' appears to be more ancient.

=== Tripurantaka ===
{{Main|Tripurantaka}}
{{See also|Tripura (mythology)}}
[[File:Shiva Tripurantaka.jpg|thumb|right|The five-headed [[Tripurantaka]] is seen pointing an arrow towards the Tripura (rightmost top corner) with the bow made of mount Meru, the serpent Vasuki is seen as its string.]]
Shiva is often depicted as an archer in the act of destroying the triple fortresses, ''Tripura'', of the Asuras.<ref>For evolution of this story from early sources to the epic period, when it was used to enhance Shiva's increasing influence, see: Chakravarti, p.46.</ref>  Shiva's name Tripurantaka (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|<U+0924><U+094D><U+0930><U+093F><U+092A><U+0941><U+0930><U+093E><U+0928><U+094D><U+0924><U+0915>}}, ''{{IAST|Tripur<U+0101>ntaka}}''), "ender of Tripura", refers to this important story.<ref>For the {{IAST|Tripur<U+0101>ntaka}} form, see: Sivaramamurti (1976), pp. 34, 49.</ref> In this aspect, Shiva is depicted with four arms wielding a bow and arrow, but different from the Pinakapani murti. He holds an axe and a deer on the upper pair of his arms. In the lower pair of the arms, he holds a bow and an arrow respectively. After destroying [[Tripura (mythology)|Tripura]], Tripurantaka Shiva smeared his forehead with three strokes of Ashes. This has become a prominent symbol of Shiva and is practiced even today by Shaivites.

===Other forms, avatars, identifications===
Shiva, like some other Hindu deities, is said to have several incarnations, known as [[Avatar]]s. Although [[Puranas|Puranic scriptures]] contain occasional references to "ansh" avatars of Shiva, the idea is not universally accepted in [[Saivism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Parrinder| first= Edward Geoffrey |title=Avatar and incarnation |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1982 |page= 88 |isbn=0-19-520361-5 }}</ref> The [[Linga Purana]] speaks of twenty-eight forms of Shiva which are sometimes seen as avatars.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winternitz|first=Moriz|coauthors=V.

== Relationship with Vishnu ==
During the Vedic period, both [[Vishnu]] and Shiva (as identified with Rudra) played relatively minor roles, but by the time of the Brahmanas (c. 1000 - 700 BC), both were gaining ascendance.<ref>For relatively minor position in Vedic times, and rise in progress by 1000-700 BC see: Zimmer (1946), p. 125, note 2.</ref> By the Puranic period, both deities had major sects that competed with one another for devotees.<ref>For the rise in popularity of Shiva and Vishnu, and the role of Puranas in promoting sectarian positions, see: Flood (1996), pp. 110-111.</ref>  Many stories developed showing different types of relationships between these two important deities.

Sectarian groups each presented their own preferred deity as supreme. Vishnu in his myths "becomes" Shiva.<ref>For Visnu becoming Shiva in [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] myths, see: Zimmer (1946), p. 125.</ref> The ''Vishnu Purana'' (4th century CE) shows Vishnu awakening and becoming both {{IAST|Brahm<U+0101>}} to create the world and Shiva to destroy it.<ref>For Vishnu Purana dating of 4th century CE and role of Vishnu as supreme deity, see: Flood (1996), p. 111.</ref> Shiva also is viewed as a manifestation of Vishnu in the ''Bhagavata Purana''.<ref>For identification of Shiva as a manifestation of Vishnu see: ''Bhagavata Purana'' 4.30.23, 5.17.22-23, 10.14.19.</ref>  In Shaivite myths, on the other hand, Shiva comes to the fore and acts independently and alone to create, preserve, destroy, hide, and to bless (five works).<ref>For predominant role of Shiva in some myths, see: Zimmer (1946), p. 128.</ref> In one Shaivite myth of the origin of the lingam, both Vishnu and {{IAST|Brahm<U+0101>}} are revealed as emanations from Shiva's manifestation as a towering pillar of flame.<ref>For the ''lingodbhava'' myth, and Vishnu and Brahm<U+0101> as emanations of Shiva, see: Zimmer (1946), pp. 128-129.</ref> The [[Shri Rudram|''<U+015A>atarudr<U+012B>ya'']], a Shaivite hymn, says that Shiva is "of the form of Vishnu".<ref>For translation of the epithet {{lang|sa|<U+0936><U+093F><U+092A><U+093F><U+0935><U+093F><U+0937><U+094D><U+091F>}} (IAST: ''{{IAST|<U+015B>ipivi<U+1E63><U+1E6D>a}}'') as "salutation to him of the form of Vish<U+1E47>u" included in the fifth ''{{IAST|anuv<U+0101>ka}}'', and comment that this epithet "links {{IAST|<U+015A>iva}} with {{IAST|Vish<U+1E47>u}}" see: Sivaramamurti, pp. 21, 64.</ref>  Differences in viewpoints between the two sects are apparent in the story of [[Sharaba|{{IAST|<U+015A>arabha}}]] (also spelled "Sharabha"), the name of Shiva's incarnation in the composite form of man, bird, and beast. Shiva assumed that unusual form of Sarabheshwara to chastise Vishnu, who in his hybrid form as [[Narasimha]], the man-lion, killed [[Hiranyakashipu]].<ref>For {{IAST|<U+015A>arabha}} as an "animal symplegma" form of Shiva, see: Kramrisch, p. 481.</ref><ref>For incarnation in composite form as man, bird, and beast to chastise Narasimha, see: Chakravarti, p. 49.</ref> However, Vaishnava followers including [[Dvaita]] scholars, such as Vijayindra Tirtha (1539<U+2013>95) dispute this view of Narasimha based on their reading of [[Puranas|Sattvika Puranas]] and [[<U+015A>ruti]] texts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharma|first= B.

According to Mahabharata, a Vaishnav text, [[Lord Krishna]], an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, is one of the greatest devotees of Lord Shiva. In Mahabharata, Anushasana Parva, i.e., In Book 13, Chapter 15 verses 1 to 51, Lord Krishna explains to Yudistira how he got initiated into Pashupata Diksha and how he obtained the grace of Lord Shiva. About soliciting boons of Lord Shiva, Lord Krishna says, "Bowing my head with great joy unto that mass of energy and effulgence (meaning Lord Shiva)...". He calls Lord Shiva ''Brahman'', ''Parameshwar'' (the Supreme God) and ''Paramatman'' (the Supreme Soul).<ref name=Shiva_sahasra>http://www.saivism.net/prayers/sahasranamam.asp</ref>

Syncretic forces produced stories in which the two deities were shown in cooperative relationships and combined forms. [[Harihara]] is the name of a combined deity form of both [[Vishnu]] ([[Hari]]) and Shiva (Hara).<ref>Chakravarti, pp. 54-55.</ref> This dual form, which is also called Harirudra, is mentioned in the [[Mahabharata]].<ref>For Harirudra citation to Mbh. III.39.76f see: Hopkins (1969), p. 221.</ref> An example of a collaboration story is one given to explain Shiva's epithet {{IAST|Mah<U+0101>bale<U+015B>vara}}, "lord of great strength" (''Maha'' = "great", ''Bala'' = "strength", ''{{IAST|<U+012A><U+015B>vara}}'' = "lord"). This name refers to a story in which [[Ravana|{{IAST|R<U+0101>va<U+1E47>a}}]] was given a ''[[linga]]'' as a boon by Shiva on the condition that he carry it always. During his travels, he stopped near the present [[Gokarna, India]] in [[Karnataka]] to purify himself and asked [[Ganesha]], a son of Parvathi in the guise of a young [[Brahmin]], to hold the ''linga'' for him, but after some time, Ganesha put it down on the ground and vanished.

As one story goes, Shiva is enticed by the beauty and charm of [[Mohini]], Vishnu's female avatar, and procreates with her.

{{Main|Maha Shivaratri}}
Maha Shivratri is a festival celebrated every year on the 13th night or the 14th day of the new moon in the Krishna [[Paksha]] of the month of [[Maagha]] or [[Phalguna]] in the [[Hindu calendar]]. This [[Hindu festivals|festival]] is of utmost importance to the devotees of Lord Shiva. Mahashivaratri marks the night when Lord Shiva performed the '[[Tandava]]' and it is also believed that Lord Shiva was married to Parvati.<ref>{{cite book|first= Dr. B. R. Kishore|title=Lord Shiva|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books Pvt. Ltd.|year=2001|page=49|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Lkqf5GrupR8C&pg=PA44&dq=shivaratri&q=shivaratri|isbn=81-7182-686-5}}</ref>  The holiday is often celebrated with special prayers and rituals offered up to Shiva, notably the Abhishek. This ritual, practiced throughout the night, is often performed every three hours with water, milk, yogurt, and honey. Bel leaves are often offered up to the Hindu god, as it is considered necessary for a successful life. The offering of the leaves are considered so important that it is believed that someone who offers them without any intentions will be rewarded greatly.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Saraswati, Chidanand, Swami|title=Shiva as Destroyer|journal=Dialogue & Alliance|year=2006|month=January|pages=79<U+2013>83|url=http://web.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7708d749-b7d2-4a64-aaa9-48038baaca96%40sessionmgr114&vid=1&hid=114|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>

== Beyond Hinduism ==

===Buddhism===

Shiva is mentioned in  [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantra]]. Shiva as ''Upaya'' and Shakti as ''Prajna''.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=x_FJcRDXhfQC&pg=PA95 | title=Buddhist Thought and Ritual | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publications | author=[[David Kalupahana]] | year=2001 | page=95 | isbn=8120817737 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref> In cosmologies of buddhist tantra, Shiva is depicted as active, skillful, and more passive.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9aWyaaw9pC0C&pg=PA43 | title=What Is Tantric Practice? | author=Barnaby B. Dhs | page=43 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref>

===Sikhism===
The Japuji Sahib of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] says, "The Guru is Shiva, the Guru is Vishnu and Brahma; the Guru is Paarvati and Lakhshmi." In the same chapter, it also says, "Shiva speaks, the Siddhas speak."

In [[Dasam Granth]], Guru Gobind Singh have mentioned two avtars of Rudra: [[Dattatreya]] Avtar and [[Parasnath]] Avtar.<ref>[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8-h8ptzp0lUC&pg=PA16&dq=chaubis+avtar&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IuXcT6XCHYunrAeB0_DGDQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=chaubis%20avtar&f=false Composition 10, Rudra Avtar]</ref>

===Others===

The cult of Lord Shiva became popular in Central Asia through the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalite (White Hun) Dynasty]],<ref name="ReferenceA">Puri, P. 132 Buddhism in Central Asia</ref> and [[Kushan Empire]]. Shaivism was also popular in Sogdiana and Eastern Turkestan as found from the wall painting from Penjikent on the river Zervashan.<ref name="ReferenceB">Puri, P. 133 Buddhism in Central Asia</ref> In this depiction, Shiva is portrayed with a sacred halo and a sacred thread ("Yajnopavita").<ref name="ReferenceB"/> He is clad in tiger skin while his attendants are wearing Sodgian dress.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In Eastern Turkestan in the Taklamakan Desert.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> There is a depiction of his four-legged seated cross-legged n a cushioned seat supported by two bulls.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Another panel form Dandan-Uilip shows Shiva in His Trimurti form with His Shakti kneeling on her right thigh.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref name="unesco427">[http://en.unesco.org/silkroad/sites/silkroad/files/knowledge-bank-article/vol_III%20silk%20road_religions%20and%20religious%20movements%20II.pdf Religions and Religious Movements <U+2013> II, p. 427]</ref>  It is also noted that [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] wind god [[Vayu-Vata]] took on the iconographic appearance of Shiva.<ref name="unesco427"/>

[[Kirant Mundhum|Kirant]] people worship a form of Shiva as one of their major god. Kirants are Mongol tribe of Nepal. They worship Shiva as the lord of animals. They are the worshiper of nature, so Shiva is a major deity. It is also said that the physical form of Shiva as a yogi is derived from Kirants as it is mentioned in Mundhum that Shiva took human form as a child of Kirant. He is also said to give Kirants visions in form of a male deer.

In Indonesia, Shiva is also worshiped as [[Batara Guru]]. His other name is "Sang Hyang Jagadnata" (king of the universe) and "Sang Hyang Girinata" (king of mountains).<ref>[http://www.joglosemar.co.id/bataraguru.html Batara Guru and The World of Gods]</ref> In the ancient times, all kingdoms were located on top of mountains. When he was young, before receiving his authority of power, his name was Sang Hyang Manikmaya. He is first of the children who hatched from the eggs laid by Manuk Patiaraja, wife of god Mulajadi na Bolon. This avatar is also worshiped in Malaysia. Shiva's other form in Indonesian Hindu worship is "Maharaja Dewa" (Mahadeva). Both the forms are closely identified with the Sun in local forms of Hinduism or Kebatinan, and even in the genie lore of Muslims.
