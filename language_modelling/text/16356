'''CBC Television''' is a [[Canadian]] [[English language]] [[television network]]. It is owned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]].

==Overview==
CBC Television provides a complete network schedule throughout the day, seven days a week, in most cases feeding the same programming at the same local times nationwide, except to the [[Newfoundland Standard Time Zone]], where programs air 30 minutes "late". As of 6:00 a.m. on October 9, 2006, the network went to a 24-hour schedule, becoming one of the last major English-language broadcasters to do so. Previously, most CBC-owned stations actually [[Sign-off (broadcast)|signed off]] the airwaves during the early morning hours (typically 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). Instead of the [[infomercial]]s aired by most private stations, or a simulcast of [[CBC Newsworld]] in the style of [[BBC One]]'s nightly simulcast of [[BBC News 24]], CBC will use the time to air repeats, including local news, primetime series, movies, and other programming from the CBC library. [http://jam.canoe.ca/Television/2006/10/05/1963028-cp.html]

While historically there has been room for regional differences in the schedule, as there is today (see "Stations", below), for CBC-owned stations funding has decreased to the point that most of these stations only broadcast 30 minutes a day of local news, and usually no other local programming. However, the CBC has recently [http://www.friends.ca/News/Friends_News/archives/articles06200508.asp indicated] that local programming will be expanded in some markets in fall [[2005]] as a pilot project.

Until the mid-[[1990s]], the network carried a variety of [[United States|American]] programs in addition to its core Canadian programming, directly competing with private Canadian broadcasters such as [[CTV]] and [[Global TV|Global]]. Since then, it has restricted itself to Canadian programs, a handful of [[United Kingdom|British]] programs, and a few American [[Film|movie]]s and off-network repeats.

As of [[2002]], CBC Television and [[CBC Newsworld]] were the only broadcasters in Canada (and very likely the only broadcasters worldwide) required to provide [[closed captioning]] for 100% of their programming. On those networks, only outside commercials do not need to be captioned, though a bare majority of them are aired with captions. All shows, bumpers, billboards, promos, and other internal programming must be captioned. The requirement stems from a [http://www.caj.ca/mediamag/winter2001/lastword.html human rights complaint] filed by deaf lawyer Henry Vlug that was [http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/media_room/news_releases-en.asp?id=247&content_type=2 settled in 2002].

==Programming==
===News and current affairs===
The CBC's flagship newscast, ''[[The National]]'', airs weeknights at 10:00. Until October 2006, CBC-owned and operated stations aired a second broadcast of the program at 11 p.m; this later broadcast included only the main news portion of the program, and excludes the analysis and documentary segment. This second airing was replaced in October 2006 with ''[[CBC News: The Hour]]'', which was previously seen earlier on Newsworld.

''[[CBC News: Sunday Night]]'' airs in the 10:00 slot on Sunday nights, while there is only a short news update, at most, late Saturday evenings -- during hockey season, this update is usually found during the first intermission of the second game of the doubleheader on ''[[Hockey Night In Canada]]''.

Early evenings are filled by local news, titled ''[[CBC News at Six]]'' in most markets, followed by the national ''[[Canada Now]]'' at 6:30. ''[[Saturday Report]]'' airs at 6:00 p.m., while there is no early Sunday-evening newscast. Other newscasts air weekdays at 6:00 a.m. and noon. Weekly newsmagazine ''[[the fifth estate]]'' is also a CBC mainstay, as are documentary series such as ''[[The Passionate Eye]]''.

===Sports===
One of the most popular shows on CBC Television is the weekly Saturday night broadcast of [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Ice hockey|hockey]] games, ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''. It has been televised since [[1952]]. However, the NHL lockout and subsequent cancellation of the 2004-2005 hockey season, CBC instead aired various recent and classic movies, branded as ''Movie Night in Canada'', on Saturday nights. Many cultural groups criticized this and suggested the CBC air games from minor hockey leagues; the CBC responded that most such broadcast rights were already held by other groups, but it did base each ''Movie Night'' broadcast from a different Canadian hockey venue.

Other than hockey, CBC Sports properties include the [[Canadian Football League]], the [[Olympic Games]] through the [[2008]] edition, and various other amateur and professional events. It was also the exclusive carrier of [[Canadian Curling Association]] events during the [[2004]]-[[2005]] season. 

Due to disappointing results and fan outrage over many draws being carried on [[CBC Country Canada]], the association tried to cancel its multiyear deal with the CBC signed in 2004. After the CBC threatened legal action, both sides eventually came to an agreement under which early-round rights reverted to [[TSN]]. 

However, as of June 15, 2006, the [[Canadian Curling Association]] announced that [[TSN]]/[[CTV]] will obtain exclusive rights to curling broadcasts in [[Canada]] as of the 2008-09 season[http://www.curling.ca/about_the_cca/press_releases/press_release.asp?id=1224102758], shutting the CBC out of the championship weekend for the first time in 40-plus years.

===Entertainment===
Among CBC Television's best-known primetime series are [[satire|satirical]] [[comedy]] series ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'', ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' and ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'', and [[drama]]s such as ''[[This is Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Da Vinci's City Hall]]'' (the successor to ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''). In recent years, British series such as ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' have been given greater prominence; as noted above, it now carries very few American series &mdash; afternoon strip reruns of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' are the only American programs currently appearing on the network's regular schedule. In general, ratings have dipped significantly since this shift, leading the CBC to invest more in "high-impact" programming such as miniseries, which have not done as poorly as continuing series.

Daytime afternoon programming is mostly given over to various early-[[20th century]] and Canadian-made movies, the British soap ''[[Emmerdale]]'', as well as repeats from previous seasons of primetime series such as ''Air Farce'' or ''[[The Red Green Show]]''.

In a controversial decision, in the summer of 2006, ''The National'' was bumped to 11 p.m. on Tuesday nights in the [[Eastern Time Zone]], in order to simulcast the American airing of ''[[The One: Making a Music Star]]''. A Canadian version of the series will launch in the coming season in another time slot, but a condition of the CBC's franchise deal for this production was to simulcast the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] production. This also represents the first time in over a decade that the CBC has scheduled an American-produced series in [[prime time]]. CBC Television reportedly passed on an earlier opportunity to air ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', which instead went to [[CTV television network|CTV]], in part because a similar arrangement would have required the network to air ''[[American Idol]]'' as well. Due to record-low ratings on ABC and CBC, ''The One'' flopped after only two weeks and four episodes, and ''The National'' returned to 10 p.m. five nights a week.

On [[January 9]], [[2007]], CBC Television is airing the pilot of a new series called ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'', a comedy about a [[Islam|Muslim]] family living in rural [[Saskatchewan]].

==== Aiming for youth ====

The CBC has recently announced radical changes to its fall lineup, including the following new series:

* ''[[Dragon's Den]]''
* ''[[The One: Making a Music Star]]'' (a Canadian version of the American program; CBC simulcasted the American version in July 2006) 
* ''[[Underdogs (TV series)|Underdogs]]'' (a spinoff of ''[[Marketplace (TV series)|Marketplace]]'')
* ''[[Intelligence (TV series)|Intelligence]]'' (drama)
* ''[[Rumours (TV series)|Rumours]]'' (comedy)
* ''[[Jozi-H]]'' (medical drama)
* ''[[72 Hours: True Crime]]'' (crime documentary series; already on schedule but will air in "core" of primetime for first time)
* repeats of ''[[CBC News: The Hour]]'' on the main CBC network
* ''[[11 Cameras]]''
Many were surprised by these changes to the CBC schedule. Another note of criticism was made when the network decided to move ''[[The National]]'' in some time zones to simulcast the American version of ''The One'' over the summer.

===Children's programming===
Children's and youth programming, often marketed as "[[Kids' CBC]]" (for younger kids) or "The Void" (formerly [[The X (CBC)|The X]]) (for pre-teens), occupies a significant portion of the morning and late-afternoon schedules on weekdays, and much of weekend mornings as well. However, despite a number of revamps, its influence is in decline with the continued rise of various [[specialty service]]s serving the market.

==CBC HD==
[[Image:CBC-HD.png|88px|right]]
On [[March 5]], [[2005]], CBC Television launched an [[High-definition television|HD]] simulcast of its Toronto station [[CBLT (TV)|CBLT]] which is available national via satellite and digital cable operators. There is also an HD simulcast of Vancouver's [[CBUT]].

==Stations==
Most CBC television stations, including those in the major cities, are owned and operated by the CBC itself.  CBC O&O stations deviate very little from the main network schedule, although there are some regional differences from time to time. For on-air identification, most CBC stations use the CBC brand rather than their call letters, not identifying themselves specifically until sign-on or sign-off (though some, like Toronto's [[CBLT]], don't ID themselves at all). All CBC O&O stations have a standard call-letter naming convention, in that the first two letters are "CB" and the last letter is "T". An exception to this rule are the [[CBC North]] stations in [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories|Yellowknife]], [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] and [[Iqaluit, Nunavut|Iqaluit]].

Some stations that broadcast from smaller cities are private [[affiliate]]s of the CBC, that is, stations which are owned by commercial broadcasters but air a predominantly CBC schedule.  Such stations ''generally'' follow the CBC schedule, although they may opt out of some CBC programming in order to air locally-produced programs, syndicated series or programs purchased from other broadcasters (especially [[CH (television station)|CH]]) which do not have a broadcast outlet in the same market.  In these cases, the CBC programming being displaced may be broadcast at a different time than the network, or may not be broadcast on the station at all. Private affiliates generally opt out of CBC's afternoon schedule, Thursday night arts programming, ''[[ZeD]]'' and ''[[Canada Now]]''. Private affiliates carry the 10 p.m. broadcast of ''[[The National]]'' as a core part of the CBC schedule, but generally omit the 11 p.m. repeat. Most private affiliates produce their own local newscasts. 

Private CBC affiliates are not as common as they were in the past, as many such stations have been purchased either by the CBC itself or by [[CHUM Limited]], becoming [[A-Channel]] stations. One private CBC affiliate in Western Canada, [[CHBC]], joined [[CH (television station)|CH]] on February 27, 2006. When a private CBC affiliate reaffiliates with another network, the CBC normally adds a retransmitter of its nearest O&O station to ensure that CBC service is continued.  However, due to an agreement between CHBC and [[CFJC]] in nearby Kamloops, CFJC has also disaffilated from the CBC on February 27, 2006, but no retransmitters were installed in the licence area. 

CBC television stations in [[Nunavut]], the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Yukon]], branded as [[CBC North]], tailor their programming mostly to the local native population, and broadcast in many native languages such as [[Inuktitut]], [[Gwich<U+02BC>in]], and [[Dene]].

==CBC Television's presence in the United States==
===Carriage of CBC News===
From [[1994]] through July [[2005]], CBC news programming was aired in the United States on [[Newsworld International]].

On [[September 11]], [[2001]], several American broadcasters without their own news operations, including [[C-SPAN]], carried the CBC's coverage of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, DC]]. In the days after September 11, C-SPAN carried CBC's nightly newscast, ''[[The National]]'', anchored by [[Peter Mansbridge]].

C-SPAN has also carried CBC's coverage of major events affecting Canadians. Among them:
* [[Canadian federal election]]s.
* Six days in September [[2000]] that marked the [[death and state funeral of Pierre Elliott Trudeau]].
* The [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]]. ''The National'' aired on C-SPAN each night for about 3 weeks following the attacks on Iraq.
* The [[2003 North America blackout|power outage crisis]] in summer [[2003]].
* Key proceedings in [[Canadian Parliament]], such as state openings.
* [[U.S. presidential election]]s.
** In [[2004]], C-SPAN picked up ''The National'' the day after the election for the view from Canadians.
* State and official visits of [[President of United States|American presidents]] to Canada.
** During [[MSNBC]]'s coverage of [[President of United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s visit to Canada, CBC's senior parliamentary editor, [[Don Newman]], appeared on MSNBC.

Several [[PBS]] stations also air some CBC programming, especially ''[[The Red Green Show]]'', although no CBC programming currently airs on the full network schedule.

===Border audiences===
In the [[United States]] border communities such as [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], CBC Television stations can be received [[terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and have a significant audience. Such a phenomenon can also take place within [[Great Lakes]] communities such as [[Ashtabula, Ohio]], which receives programming from CBC's [[London, Ontario]] transmitter, based upon prevailing atmospheric conditions over [[Lake Erie]].

* In [[Southwestern Ontario]], [[Southeastern Michigan]], and Northern Ohio, [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Bowling Green, Ohio]], [[Findlay, Ohio]], and surrounding areas recieve local [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] CBC affiliate [[CBET-TV]] over the air, and on local cable systems, such as [[Bright House]], [[Wide Open West]], [[Charter Communications|Charter]], [[Comcast]], [[Time-Warner]], and [[Buckeye Cable]]. The station can also be seen as far as [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with a strong antenna.

* In Maine, [[Adelphia]] Cable carries [[CBMT]] in Bangor; cable viewers along the border can receive [[CBAT-TV]]. ''The Bangor Daily News'' carries listings for CBAT (and [[CTV Atlantic|CKLT-CTV]] [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] as well).

* In northwest [[Washington]] state, CBC O&O station [[CBUT]] is distributed to almost one million [[Comcast]] cable subscribers in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].

* In the [[Champlain Valley]] of Northern [[Upstate New York]] and [[Vermont]], local cable systems in [[Plattsburg, New York]] and [[Burlington, Vermont]] (Charter and Comcast, respectively) carry the Montreal affiliate [[CBMT-TV]].

* In northern and central [[Michigan]], Montreal CBC O&O station CBMT can be seen on [[Charter Communications|Charter]] cable systems in cities like [[Alpena, Michigan|Alpena]], [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]], [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]], [[Mount Pleasant, Michigan|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]]. 

* In addition, many cable systems in northern [[Minnesota]] and northern [[North Dakota]] carry [[CBWT]], CBC's [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]] affiliate.

* Local [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]] affiliate [[CKSH-TV]] is carried in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and much of [[New England]].

* Some communities in the US, such as [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], offer [[CBC North]] on low-powered repeaters, courtesy of the local TV association.

* CBC Television's U.S. viewers appreciate its news programmes, not to mention its variety of entertainment programmes from [[Canada]] and [[Britain]].

* Buffalo is known for its high viewership of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', while most Detroiters prefer CBC coverage of the [[NHL]] finals. The CBC's coverage of the [[Olympic Games]] has also found a significant audience in American border regions.
