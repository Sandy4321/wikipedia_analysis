The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state.<ref name="Introduction"/> The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancomonete/cambiolire;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en |title=Bank of Italy - Exchange of lira notes and coins|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011|work=Banc d'Italia|publisher=Banc d'Italia}}</ref><ref name="Introduction"></ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of the euro}}
The euro was set up on 1 January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe.<ref name="Introduction"></ref> For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the banknotes and coins of the eurozone 12, as it was then, national currencies like the [[Irish Pound]] and the [[Austrian schilling]].<ref name="Introduction"></ref>

Legally, both the European Central Bank and the central banks of the [[eurozone]] countries have the right to issue the 7 different euro banknotes. In practice, only the national central banks of the zone physically issue and withdraw euro banknotes. The European Central Bank does not have a cash office and is not involved in any cash operations.<ref name="Introduction"/>

=== Changes ===
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref> The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first [[President of the European Central Bank|president]] of the [[European Central Bank]], [[Wim Duisenberg]], who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by [[Jean-Claude Trichet]], whose signature appears on subsequent issues.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref>

==Design==
The hundred euro note measures at {{convert|147|mm}} <U+00D7> {{convert|82|mm}} and has a green colour scheme.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref> All bank notes depict bridges and arches/doorways in a different historical European style; the hundred euro note shows the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] style (between the 17th and 18th century).<ref name="Security"></ref> Although [[Robert Kalina]]'s original designs were intended to show real monuments, for political reasons the bridge and art are merely hypothetical examples of the architectural era.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/slideshow/money_talks/slide2.stm |title=Money talks - the new Euro cash|date=December 1996|accessdate=13 October 2011|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

Like all euro notes, it contains the denomination, the [[Flag of Europe|EU flag]], the signature of the president of the [[European Central Bank|ECB]] and the initials of said bank in different [[Languages of the European Union|EU languages]], a depiction of EU territories overseas, the stars from the EU flag and twelve security features as listed below.<ref name="Banknotes index"></ref>
