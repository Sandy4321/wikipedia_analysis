The [[Louis Vuitton]] Cup is used as the selection series to select the team to sail as the challenger in the [[America's Cup]].  Four out of the six winners of the Louis Vuitton Cup have subsequently won the America's Cup itself.


==History==
In 1970, for the first time in [[America's Cup]] history, multiple ''international'' challengers competed for the right to challenge the New York Yacht Club, the defender of the America's Cup (the key word being "international":  in 1964, for example, two British challengers competed for the right to challenge the NYYC.)

For the [[1983 America's Cup]] match, [[Louis Vuitton]] offered a trophy to the winner of the challenger selection series; the idea generally credited to Bruno Trouble, a French yachtsman.  The initial Louis Vuitton Cup was contested off Newport, United States, with ''[[Australia II]]'' prevailing, thereby earning the right to meet the NYYC<U+2019>s defending yacht ''[[Liberty (yacht)|Liberty]]'' in that year<U+2019>s America<U+2019>s Cup.

With the exception of the America's Cup races in [[1988 America's Cup|1988]] and [[2010 America's Cup|2010]], the winner of the Louis Vuitton Cup has been awarded the right to challenge the current defender for the America's Cup.   During the 1992 and 1995 regattas [[Citizen Watch]] offered a trophy to the winner of the defender selection series (the [[Citizen Cup]]) as the defense<U+2019>s counterpart to the Louis Vuitton cup.

===2004 to 2013===
{{seealso|Louis Vuitton Acts}}
Due to the large number of challengers in recent decades the Louis Vuitton Cup has had to eliminate challengers in two phases. A round-robin points accruing phase, and then a pair of semi-finals involving the top four, followed by a final between the top two. The semi-finals and finals are a best of nine races between two boats.

Since 2004 the Louis Vuitton Cup hosts 13 "Acts" of competition, with the first 3 acts not awarding points toward rankings.  Some challengers do not enter the competition by the start of the acts.  Rules for the current races (2005<U+2013>2007) stipulate that ranking points awarded for each act of competition will increase as they get closer to the final.  For acts taking place in 2005, standard points were awarded, with 11 ranking points for a first place finish, and points awarded decreasing based on placing.  Acts in 2006 double the points, with 22 ranking points for first place, and the final act 13 which takes place in 2007 will award triple points, giving 33 points to the winner.

History shows that the Louis Vuitton Cup series enhances the chances of the challenger due to the intense racing against different opponents which improves the tactics and crew co-ordination of the winner.  Differences in boat speed are becoming less and less placing an even greater premium on reliability, superior tactics and crewing. In the weeks leading up to the America's Cup competition, the defender has to mainly practice using in-house racing which can never be as intense as real competition.

In July 2007, Louis Vuitton announced termination of all its sponsorship activities associated with the [[America's Cup]] after 25 years of involvement, arguing the organisation of the America's Cup was taken over by business under the rule of [[Ernesto Bertarelli]], leader of [[Alinghi]], winner in 2003.<ref>[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3242,36-935239@51-895295,0.html <U+00AB> Louis-Vuitton se retire de la Coupe de l'America, jug<U+00E9>e trop commerciale <U+00BB>], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 13 July 2007.</ref> Louis Vuitton instead sponsored the [[Louis Vuitton Pacific Series]] and [[Louis Vuitton Trophy]].

After [[Oracle Racing]] won the [[America's Cup]] for the [[Golden Gate Yacht Club]] in the [[2010 America's Cup|2010]] Deed-of-Gift race against [[Alinghi]], Louis Vuitton is again sponsoring the challenger series for the [[2013 America's Cup|34th America's Cup]] to be held in 2013 on the San Francisco Bay.<ref>[http://www.americascup.com/en/Discover/Race-Format/Louis-Vuitton-Cup/ <U+00AB> www.americascup.com/en/Discover/Race-Format/Louis-Vuitton-Cup <U+00BB>] , Retrieved 17 April 2012</ref>
