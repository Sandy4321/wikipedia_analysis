Pyro is known for his distinctive vocals, [[beard]]ed demeanour<ref name="Sinead cuts Loose with new band"/> and public battles with alcoholism of which he has openly spoken in interviews.

== Influences ==
Pyro is known for his diverse musical tastes involving [[hip hop]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[blues]], with almost every record he purchases being hip hop.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> He has described hip hop as <U+201C>one of the most innovative art-forms around and it<U+2019>s constantly capable of shocking and surprising me<U+201D>.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> [[Cee-Lo Green]]'s 2004 album ''[[Soul Machine]]'' is one of Pyro's personal favourites but he also likes [[Biz Markie]], [[EPMD]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and 1980s soul and funk such as [[Alexander O'Neill]] and [[Rick James]] &ndash; one of his heroes.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> He also likes [[Metal music|metal]] bands such as [[Van Halen]] and [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]] and listens to blues and jazz such as [[Howlin<U+2019> Wolf]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Mahalia Jackson]] and soul singers such as [[Al Green]] and [[Solomon Burke]].<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> Pyro credited a former [[United States|American]] friend with a great taste in music for becoming a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk and leaving behind approximately 300 CDs of Coltrane, Mingus and Miles Davis.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> He likes the music of [[Bob Dylan]], describing his 1997 ''[[Time out of Mind]]'' album as having a "spooky" production and "savage" lyrics.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> On [[Michael Jackson]], he once said <U+201C>You feel a bit creepy listening to him and you have to be in the right mood but there<U+2019>s a really sad lament in his voice<U+201D>.<ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/>

== Style ==
Pyro is known for his excessive stage antics, with ''[[The Irish Times]]'' once describing him as having "cajoled, provoked, teased, screamed, shouted, stomped and flirted away" through an entire set with Republic of Loose.<ref name="On the Loose"/> The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' once desrcibed him as <U+201C>a bizarre mixture of [[Otis Redding]], [[Screaming Jay Hawkins]] and an Irish drunk at closing time.<U+201D><ref name="At Home With... Mick Pyro"/> However, despite this, his performances are less alcohol-related nowadays; the album ''[[Vol IV: Johnny Pyro and the Dance of Evil]]'' spoke of his previous problems with drink and Pyro admitted to ''[[The Sunday Tribune]]'' that he had been an alcoholic.<ref name="On the Loose"/> Indeed it was alcohol that inspired Pyro to write the hit song "[[Comeback Girl]]".<ref name="On the Loose">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/ontherecord/2008/04/29/on-the-loose/|title=On the Loose|date=2008-04-29|accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}</ref>
