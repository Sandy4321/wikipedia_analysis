'''T. Edward "Ed" Austin, Jr.''' (July 15, 1926 <U+2013> April 23, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[Lawyer|attorney]]. He served as [[List of mayors of Jacksonville, Florida|mayor]] of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Florida]] from 1991 to 1995. He also served as the first [[Public Defender]] for Florida's [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]] from 1963 to 1968, and served as [[State Attorney]] for the Fourth Judicial Circuit from 1969 to 1972 and again from 1974 to 1991. Austin was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for most of his career, but switched parties to become a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] during his term as mayor, becoming the first Republican to serve in the position since the [[Reconstruction era]].

==Early life==
Austin was born in [[Shenandoah, Virginia]]. In 1944 he enrolled at [[Duke University]], where he played [[college football]] and ran [[track and field|track]] for the [[Duke Blue Devils]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor's degree]] and a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|master's degree]] while at Duke, and was subsequently employed as a teacher. He later joined the [[United States Army]], where he served in the [[101st Airborne Division]] as a [[paratrooper]].<ref name=FORMER>{{cite news |title= Former Jacksonville mayor Ed Austin preached fairness, justice|author= Mary Kelli Palka|url= http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2011-04-23/story/former-jacksonville-mayor-ed-austin-preached-fairness-justice|newspaper= [[The Florida Times-Union]]|date= April 23, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}</ref>

Austin was hospitalized with a back injury; in the hospital he met his future wife, Patricia Lynch. In 1957 he was honorably discharged as a [[First Lieutenant]], and relocated to attend law school at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=FORMER/>

==Career==
Austin received a [[juris doctor]] from the [[Fredric G. Levin College of Law|UF College of Law]] in 1958, and was admitted to the Florida Bar on November 6, 1959.<ref>[http://www.floridabar.org/names.nsf/0/9DAC71284618F65185256A82007847C3?OpenDocument "T Edward Austin, Jr."] Florida Bar website, Find a Lawyer</ref>
He worked in several legal positions, including a stint as [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]]'s assistant solicitor. In 1963 he was elected as the first [[Public Defender]] for Florida's [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]], which consists of Duval, [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau]], and [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]] Counties. 

Ed Austin was an imposing figure, a "strapping John Wayne-kind of guy",<ref name=FORMER /> according to John Delaney, who first worked as an intern in the early 1980s. He was a fair man with integrity and character who motivated his co-workers and mentored those he hired.<ref name=FORMER /> 

In 1969 he was elected State Attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit. [[Jacksonville]] Mayor [[Hans Tanzler]] appointed Austin to serve as the city's General Counsel in 1972, but he returned to the State Attorney position in 1974 and was re-elected four times.<ref name=FORMER /><ref>http://www.flacls.org/goldin-archive/goldin-1991.html</ref>

In 1991 Austin resigned his position as State Attorney to run against incumbent mayor [[Tommy Hazouri]], and won the election narrowly. His most lasting contribution as mayor is his [[River City Renaissance]] program, which funded [[urban renewal]] and revamped the city's historic downtown neighborhoods. Among the buildings constructed or renovated by the program are the [[Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[Sulzbacher Center]], the stadium now known as [[EverBank Field]], and the [[Jacksonville Zoo]]. Austin oversaw the city's purchase and refurbishing of the [[St. James Building]], which would eventually become Jacksonville's new [[city hall]]. He was mayor at the time Jacksonville was awarded its [[National Football League]] franchise, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref name=FORMER /> 

During his term as mayor he switched his party affiliation from Democrat to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]; according to his chief of staff [[John Delaney]], he told his staff before leaving on a trip to [[China]] that he did not want to die a Democrat if his plane crashed.<ref name=FORMER /> In 1994 he announced he would not seek a second term as mayor. In the subsequent election he backed his chief of staff, [[John Delaney]], who defeated former mayor [[Jake Godbold]] to become the next mayor of Jacksonville.

Numerous individuals Austin hired and mentored went on to leadership positions in Jacksonville and the state of Florida, including former Chief Justice Leander Shaw of the [[Florida Supreme Court]], former mayor and [[University of North Florida]] President [[John Delaney]], former general counsel Rick Mullaney, state Representative [[Mike Weinstein]], Circuit Judge Brian Davis, [[Sulzbacher Center]] President Audrey Moran and Chief Administrator [[Lex Hester]].<ref name=FORMER /><ref>Landeros, Monica: [http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/local/article/201809/3/Update-Former-Jax-Mayor-Austin-was-Caring-Mentor-True-Statesman- "Former Jacksonville Mayor Ed Austin was 'Caring Mentor', 'True Statesman'"] First Coast News, April 24, 2011</ref><ref name=TRUE />

==Personal life==
Austin and his wife had three children and several grandchildren. His wife of 34 years, Patricia, died in a car accident near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in 1996; he was a passenger and was also injured, but recovered. In 2003, he married Connie Green; they divorced in 2006. The Ed Austin Regional Park in Arlington was dedicated in 2005,<ref>[http://apps2.coj.net/parksinternet/parkdetails.asp?parkid=234 "Ed Austin Regional Park History"] City of Jacksonville, Parks & Recreation</ref> and a $150,000 endowed scholarship was established at the [[University of North Florida]] during 2008 in his honor.<ref>[http://www.unf.edu/ia/pr/media_relations/press/2008/UNF_Fellowship_Honors_Former_Mayor_Ed_Austin.aspx "UNF Fellowship Honors Former Mayor Ed Austin"] University of North Florida press release, May 14, 2008</ref>
