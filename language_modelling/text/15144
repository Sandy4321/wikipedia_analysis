The '''Ferguson Highway''' was a {{Convert|260|mi|km|abbr=on}} long gravel [[trunk road]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Built between 1925-1927 from the city of [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] to the town of [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]], it was created to connect the growing agricultural and [[mining community|mining communities]] of [[Northern Ontario]] with other areas further south.

Several sections of rebuilt local roads were incorporated into the Ferguson Highway, with the final link being completed through the thick forest of [[Temagami]]. The highway was officially opened on July 2, 1927, and was named in honour of [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Howard Ferguson|George Howard Ferguson]]. It quickly became an important access route to settlements and tourist areas in Northern Ontario. Throughout the following 30 years, the Ferguson Highway was extensively bypassed by the current routing of [[Ontario Highway 11|Highway&nbsp;11]].

== History ==
[[File:Temagami Ferguson Highway.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard photo of the Ferguson Highway circa 1940]]
Although it was named for the man who campaigned to premiership on the promise of building the road, the Ferguson Highway was an inevitable extension of the [[List of Ontario Colonization Roads#Muskoka Road|Muskoka Colonization Road]] that came to be known as part of it.

;The Muskoka Road
Construction of the Muskoka Road began at a portage site at the mouth of the [[Severn River (Ontario)|Severn River]] where a harbour known as [[Washago, Ontario|Washago]] was established.{{sfn|Shragge|1984|p=20}} In 1858, work began on a trail north towards the survey line of the [[List of Ontario Colonization Roads#Peterson Road|Peterson Road]].{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=109}} [[Thomas J. McMurray]] established [[Bracebridge, Ontario|Bracebridge]] in the spring of 1861 at the northernmost point of the Muskoka Road where it intersected the Peterson Road.<ref name="PS history">[http://books.google.ca/books?id=Nn21iNJ2utcC&lpg=PA47&dq=ontario%20colonization%20roads&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=ontario%20colonization%20roads&f=false Parry Sound: Gateway to Northern Ontario]. p.&nbsp;47</ref>
The road was completed as far as [[Utterson, Ontario|Utterson]] in 1862.{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=111}}

Over the next decade, work progressed on the northward extension of the Muskoka Road through [[Vernon Lake, Ontario|Vernon Lake]], [[Huntsville, Ontario|Huntsville]] and the unsurveyed territory north to [[Emsdale, Ontario|Emsdale]], eventually reaching [[Burk's Falls]] in 1878. Between 1881 and 1887, the route was pushed to Sundridge, where an existing road connected to [[South River, Ontario|South River]], at which point work concentrated on opening up access roads to nearby railway stations and resources. It would take a quarter-century for construction to resume on the road. In 1912, work began south from North Bay towards [[Powassan]]. Upon the completion of that section, the remaining {{convert|20|mi|km}} between Powassan and South River was built. In 1916, it became possile for the first time to drive from [[Toronto]] to North Bay without travelling through [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]].{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=111}}

;Onwards to Cochrane
In June 1923, Howard Ferguson campaigned to victory, with one of his pledges being the construction of a [[trunk road]] from North Bay to the farmland of [[New Liskeard]] and the mineral resources of [[Kirkland Lake]] and Cochrane.{{sfn|Shragge|1984|p=77}} By then, a [[gravel road]] had already been constructed between [[Latchford, Ontario|Latchford]] and New Liskeard. This road started as a connection between the communities of Latchford and [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]], the latter of which was already connected with nearby [[Haileybury, Ontario|Haileybury]]. In 1912, following the passing of the Northern and Northwestern Development Act, which allocated funding towards the development of trunk roads, it was gravelled north of Cobalt and extended to New Liskeard.{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=111}}

After Ferguson's victory, construction began immediately on two sections. The first section was a {{convert|32|km|adj=on}} gravel road built south from Latchford to [[Temagami]]; the second was a {{convert|240|km|adj=on}} road, mostly gravelled, built north from New Liskeard to Cochrane via [[Earlton, Ontario|Earlton]], [[Englehart]], [[Dane, Ontario|Dane]], [[Swastika, Ontario|Swastika]], [[Matheson, Ontario|Matheson]], [[Monteith, Ontario|Monteith]] and [[Porquis Junction, Ontario|Porquis Junction]]. Both were complete by 1925.{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=112}} The Latchford<U+2013>Cobalt section was also given a gravel surface that year.{{sfn|Shragge|1984|p=77}} In 1926, the final {{convert|100|km}} south of Temagami to North Bay way opened to traffic, having taken the longest to construct through the impenetrable [[Temagami Forest]].{{sfn|Myers|1977|p=112}}

The fully gravelled North Bay to Cochrane Trunk Road was ceremoniously opened by [[William Finlayson]], the [[Minister of Lands and Forests]], on July&nbsp;2, 1927,<ref group="note" name="note1">Myers gives July&nbsp;1 as the ceremony date, but both Shragge and the historical plaque commemorating the route indicate July&nbsp;2.</ref>
and named in honour of Ferguson.{{sfn|Shragge|1984|p=77}} The route was later assumed as an extension of Highway&nbsp;11 throughout June 1937,<ref>{{cite report

following the amalgamation of the [[Department of Northern Development]] into the [[Department of Highways]] on April&nbsp;1.{{sfn|Shragge|1984|p=71}}

== Route description ==
Today, the vast majority of the Ferguson Highway has been bypassed by the [[Highways in Ontario|provincial highway network]]; however a select few sections were incorporated into the [[right-of-way (transportation)|alignment]] of Highway&nbsp;11, while others remain as portions of, from south to north, [[Ontario Highway 11B|Highway&nbsp;11B]], [[Ontario Highway 562|Highway&nbsp;562]], [[Ontario Highway 571|Highway&nbsp;571]], [[Ontario Highway 573|Highway&nbsp;573]], [[Ontario Highway 112|Highway&nbsp;112]], [[Ontario Highway 66|Highway&nbsp;66]] and [[Ontario Highway 668|Highway&nbsp;668]]. The remaining sections have either become local access roads or have been abandoned and subsequently consumed by nature.
