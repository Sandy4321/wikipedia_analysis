'''Virtual reality sickness''' (also known as cybersickness) occurs when exposure to a [[virtual environment]] causes symptoms that are similar to [[motion sickness]] symptoms.<ref name=one>{{cite journal|last1=LaViola|first1=J.

== Consequences of Virtual Reality Sickness ==
Virtual reality sickness may have undesirable consequences beyond the sickness itself.  For example, Crowley (1987) argued that [[flight simulator]] sickness could discourage pilots from using flight simulators, reduce the efficacy of training through distraction and the encouragement of adaptive behaviors that are unfavorable for performance, compromise ground safety or flight safety when sick and disoriented pilots leave the simulator.<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last1=Crowley|first1=J. S.|title=Simulator sickness:  A problem for Army Aviation|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=1987|volume=58|pages=355<U+2013>357}}</ref>  Similar consequences could be expected for virtual reality systems.  Although the evidence for performance decrements due to virtual reality sickness is limited,<ref name=five>{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=J.|title=Side effects of virtual environments: A review of the literature (DSTO-TR-1419)|date=2004|url=from  http://dspace.dsto.defence.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/1947/ 4079/1/DSTO-TR-1419%20PR.pdf|publisher=Defense Sciences and Technology Organisation Information Sciences Laboratory|location=Edinburgh, Australia}}</ref> research does suggest that virtual reality sickness is a major barrier to using virtual reality,<ref name=six>{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=J. O.|last2=Goodenough|first2=R. R.|last3=Crisler|first3=M. C.|last4=Klein|first4=N. D.|last5=Alley|first5=R. L.|last6=Koon|first6=B. L.|last7=...|last8=Wills|first8=R.

== Theories of Virtual Reality Sickness ==
Currently, there are no clear theories as to why virtual reality sickness in particular occurs; however, it is closely related to simulator and motion sickness.  Sensory conflict theory provides a framework for understanding motion sickness; however, it can be applied to virtual reality sickness to better understand how it can occur,<ref name=twentysix>{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=D.|title=Introduction to and Review of Simulator Sickness Research (Research Report 1832)|date=April 2005|publisher=U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences}}</ref> and is commonly used for that purpose.<ref name=two />  Sensory conflict theory posits that sickness will occur when a user<U+2019>s  [[illusions of self-motion|perception ofself-motion]] is based on incongruent sensory inputs from the visual system, [[vestibular system]], and non-vestibular [[proprioceptors]], and particularly so when these inputs are at odds with the user<U+2019>s expectation based on prior experience.<ref name=twentyseven>{{cite book|last1=Reason|first1=J. T.|last2=Brand|first2=J. J.|title=Motion sickness|date=1975|publisher=Academic Press|location=London}}</ref>  Applying this theory to virtual reality, sickness can be minimized when the sensory inputs inducing self-motion are in agreement with one another.

The physiology behind VR sickness is not currently clearly understood. Fortunately, research has uncovered some clear indications of certain conditions that cause VR sickness.  It seems that the images projected from virtual reality have a major impact on sickness.  The [[refresh rate]] of on-screen images is often not high enough when VR sickness occurs. Because the refresh rate is slower than what the brain processes, it causes a discord between the processing rate and the refresh rate, which causes the user to perceive <U+201C>glitches<U+201D> on the screen.  When these two components do match up, it can cause the user to experience the same feelings as simulator and motion sickness which is mentioned below.

The resolution on animation can also causes users to experience this phenomenon. When animations are poor, it causes another type of discord between what is expected and what is actually happening on the screen. When onscreen graphics do not keep the pace with the users<U+2019> head movements, it can trigger a form of motion sickness.

Another trigger of virtual reality sickness is when there is disparity in apparent motion between the visual and vestibular stimuli. Essentially what happens is there is a disagreement between what the stimuli from the eyes send to the brain and what the stimuli from the inner ear are sending to the brain. This is what is essentially at the heart of both simulator and motion sickness. In Virtual Reality, the eyes transmit that the person is running and jumping through a dimension, however, the ears transmit that no movement is occurring and that the body is sitting still. Since there is this discord between the eyes and the ears, a form of motion sickness can occur.

Not all scientists agree with sensory conflict theory.<ref name=two />  A second theory of motion sickness, which has also been used to explain virtual reality sickness, is the theory of postural instability.<ref name=twentynine>{{cite journal|last1=Stoffregen|first1=T. A.|last2=Riccio|first2=G. E.|title=An ecological theory of orientation and the vestibular system|journal=Psychological Review|date=1988|volume=95|pages=3<U+2013>14}}</ref>  This is the theory that motion sickness and related sicknesses occur because something has occurred to destabilize the person<U+2019>s posture.  This theory can explain some otherwise surprising situations in which motion sickness did not occur in the presence of sensory conflict.<ref name=thirty>{{cite journal|last1=Riccio|first1=G. E.|last2=Martin|first2=E. J.|last3=Stoffregen|first3=T. A.|title=The role of balance dynamics in the active perception of orientation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1992|volume=18|pages=624<U+2013>644}}</ref>

== Technical Aspects ==
There are various technical aspects of virtual reality that can induce sickness, such as mismatched motion,<ref name=twentytwo>{{cite journal|last1=Groen|first1=E.|last2=Bos|first2=J.|title=Simulator sickness depends on frequency of the simulator motion mismatch: An observation|journal=Presence|date=2008|volume=17|issue=6|pages=584<U+2013>593}}</ref> field of view,<ref name=twentythree>{{cite journal|last1=Lin|first1=J. J.|last2=Duh|first2=H. B. L.|last3=Parker|first3=D. E.|last4=Abi-Rached|first4=H.|last5=Furness|first5=T. A.|title=Effects of field of view on presence, enjoyment, memory, and simulator sickness in a virtual environment|journal=Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality|date=2002|volume=9|pages=164<U+2013>171|doi=10.1109/VR.2002.996519}}</ref> motion parallax,<ref name=twentyfour>{{cite journal|last1=Jinjakam|first1=C.|last2=Kazuhiko|first2=H.|title=Study on parallax affect on simulator sickness in one-screen and three-screen immersive virtual environment|journal=<U+6771><U+6D77><U+5927><U+5B66><U+7D00><U+8981><U+60C5><U+5831><U+901A><U+4FE1><U+5B66><U+90E8>|date=2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=34<U+2013>39}}</ref> and viewing angle.<ref name=twentyeight>{{cite journal|last1=Ruddle|first1=R. A.|title=The effect of environment characteristics and user interaction on levels of virtual environment sickness|journal=Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality|date=2004|volume=11|pages=141<U+2013>148|doi=10.1109/VR.2004.1310067}}</ref>  Additionally, the amount of time spent in virtual reality can increase the presence of symptoms.<ref name=twentyeight /> 
Mismatched motion can be defined as a discrepancy between the motion of the simulation and the motion that the user expects.<ref name=twentytwo />  It is possible to induce motion sickness in virtual reality when the frequencies of mismatched motion are similar to those for motion sickness in reality, such as seasickness.<ref name=twentytwo />  These frequencies can be experimentally manipulated, but also have the propensity to arise from system errors.
Generally, increasing the [[field of view]] increases incidence of simulator sickness symptoms.  This relationship has been shown to be curvilinear, with symptoms approaching an asymptote for fields of view above 140<U+00B0>.<ref name=twentythree />
Altering motion parallax distances to those less than the distance between the human eyes in large multiple-screen simulation setups can induce oculomotor distress, such as headaches, [[eyestrain]], and blurred vision.<ref name=twentyfour />  There are fewer reports of oculomotor distress on smaller screens; however, most simulation setups with motion parallax effects can still induce eyestrain, fatigue, and general discomfort over time.<ref name=twentyfive>{{cite journal|last1=Jinjakam|first1=C.|last2=Odagiri|first2=Y.|last3=Dejhan|first3=K.|last4=Kazuhiko|first4=H.|title=Comparative study of virtual sickness between a single-screen and three-screen from parallax affect|journal=International Science Index|date=2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=195<U+2013>198}}</ref>
Viewing angle has been shown to increase a user<U+2019>s sickness symptoms, especially at extreme angles.<ref name=twentyeight />  One example of such an extreme angle would be when a user must look downwards a short distance in front of their <U+201C>virtual feet<U+201D>.  As opposed to a forward viewing angle, an extreme downward angle such as this has been shown to markedly increase sickness in virtual environments.<ref name=twentyeight />
Time spent immersed in a virtual environment contributes to sickness symptom presence due to the increasing effects of fatigue on the user.<ref name=twentyeight />  Oculomotor symptoms are the most common to occur due to immersion time, but the nature of the user<U+2019>s movements (e.g., whole-body vs. head-only) is suggested to be the primary cause of nausea or physical sickness.<ref name=twentyeight />

== Newest Technology ==
With the integration of virtual reality into the more commercial mainstream, issues have begun to arise in relation to VR sickness in head mounted gaming devices, such as the [[Oculus Rift]] and Sony [[Project Morpheus (virtual reality)|Morpheus]].<ref name=nineteen>{{cite journal|last1=Lang|first1=B.|title=First impressions of Valve's VR head mounted display prototype|journal=Road to Virtual Reality|date=January 16, 2014|url=http://www.roadtovr.com/valve-head-mounted-display-virtual-reality-headset-steam-dev-days/|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> While research on head mounted VR for gaming dates back to the early 2000s,<ref name=twenty>{{cite journal|last1=Merhi|first1=O.|last2=Faugloire|first2=E.|last3=Flanagan|first3=M.|last4=Stoffregen|first4=T. A.|title=Motion sickness, video games, and head-mounted displays|journal=Human Factors|date=2007|volume=49|pages=920<U+2013>934}}</ref> the potential for mass usability in console based games such as the Xbox and PlayStation has only become recently realized.
While certain features are known to moderate VR sickness in head mounted displays, such as playing from a seated position rather than standing,<ref name=twenty /> it has also been found that this merely puts off the onset of sickness, rather than completely preventing it. This inherently presents an issue, in that this type of interactive VR often involves standing or walking for a fully immersive experience.<ref name=nineteen /> Gaming VR specialists argue that this unique brand of VR sickness is only a minor issue, claiming that it disappears with time spent (multiple days) using the head-mounted displays, relating it to <U+201C>getting your sea legs<U+201D>.<ref name=twentyone>{{cite web|title=The Promise and Challenges of Head-Mounted Virtual Reality Displays - Tested.com|url=http://www.tested.com/tech/gaming/454559-valves-michael-abrash-promise-and-challenges-vr/|website=Tested.com|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> However, getting users interested in sickness for multiple days with the promise of <U+201C>probably getting over it<U+201D> is a struggle that developers of head-mounted gaming tech are struggling with. These same developers also argue that it has more to do with the individual game being played, and that certain gaming aspects are more likely to create issues, such as change in speed, walking up stairs, and jumping,<ref name=twentyone /> which are all, unfortunately, fairly normal game functions in the predominant genres. 
Some companies, such as [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], have been developing and addressing these issues with simulator sickness for more than ten years.<ref name=nineteen /> While Valve<U+2019>s currently nameless VR head mounted display (HMD) is not yet being marketed or tested to the extremes of the Rift or the Morpheus, users who have been able to test it have argued for drastic differences in the likeliness of sickness. It is an important note, however, that Valve<U+2019>s HMD has been purely used for research, and is not a commercial product like the Rift or the Morpheus; having said that, it is not out of the reach of possibility that Valve<U+2019>s HMD will be the slowest to commercial availability, but the most thoroughly researched and properly constructed to address the issues of simulator sickness in this unique type of display.<ref name=nineteen /><ref name=twentyone />

== Individual Differences in Susceptibility ==
Individuals vary widely in their susceptibility to simulator and virtual reality sickness.<ref name=two />  Some of the factors in virtual reality sickness are listed below:<ref name=two />

* Age: Susceptibility to motion sickness is highest between the ages of 2 and 12.  It then decreases rapidly until about age 21, and continues to decrease more slowly after that.<ref name=twentyseven />  It has been suggested that virtual reality sickness might follow a similar pattern,<ref name=two /> but more recent research has suggested that adults over the age of 50 are more susceptible than younger adults to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=six />
* Postural stability: Postural instability has been found to increase susceptibility to visually-induced motion sickness.<ref name=eight>{{cite journal|last1=Smart|first1=L. J., Jr.|last2=Stoffregen|first2=T. A.|last3=Bardy|first3=B. G.|title=Visually induced motion sickness predicted by postural instability|journal=Human Factors|date=2002|volume=44|pages=451<U+2013>465}}</ref>  Not surprisingly, it is also associated with increased susceptibility to nausea and disorientation symptoms of virtual reality sickness.<ref name=two /><ref name=nine>{{cite journal|last1=Kolasinski|first1=E. M.|last2=Jones|first2=S. A.|last3=Kennedy|first3=R. S.|last4=Gilson|first4=R. D.|title=Postural stability and its relation to simulator sickness|journal=Poster presented at the 38th annual meeting of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society|date=January 1994|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hfes/hfproc/1994/00000038/00000015/art00071}}</ref>
* Flicker fusion frequency threshold: Because flicker in the display has been associated with increased risk of virtual reality sickness, people with a low threshold for detecting flicker may be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=two />
* Ethnicity: Asiatic people may be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=five /> Chinese women appear to be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness than European-American and African-American women; research suggests that they are more susceptible to vision-based motion sickness.<ref name=ten>{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=R. M.|last2=Hu|first2=S.|last3=LeBlanc|first3=R.|last4=Koch|first4=K. L.|title=Chinese hyper-susceptibility to vection-induced motion sickness|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=1993|volume=64|pages=827<U+2013>830}}</ref>  Tibetans and Northeast Indians also appear to be more susceptible to motion sickness than Caucasian people,<ref name=eleven>{{cite journal|last1=Sharma|first1=K|last2=Aparna|title=Prevalence and correlates of susceptibility to motion sickness|journal=Acta Geneticae Medicae et Gemellologia|date=1997|volume=46|pages=105<U+2013>121}}</ref> suggesting that they would also be more susceptible to virtual reality sickness, since susceptibility to motion sickness predicts susceptibility to a wide range of motion-sickness related disturbances.<ref name=five />
* Experience with the system: Users seem to become less likely to develop virtual reality sickness as they develop familiarity with a virtual reality system.  Adaptation may occur as quickly as the second exposure to the virtual reality system.<ref name=twelve>{{cite journal|last1=Uliano|first1=K. C.|last2=Lambert|first2=E. Y.|last3=Kennedy|first3=R. S.|last4=Sheppard|first4=D. J.|title=The effects of asynchronous visual delays on simulator flight performance and the development of simulator sickness symptomatology (NAVTRASYSCEN 85-D-0026-1)|publisher=Naval Training Systems Center|location=Orlando, FL}}</ref>  There is also evidence to suggest that more experience with virtual reality in general is related to a lower likelihood of experiencing virtual reality sickness.<ref name=twentytwo />
* Gender: Women are more susceptible than men to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=thirteen>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=R. S.|last2=Frank|first2=L. H.|title=A review of motion sickness with special reference to simulator sickness|journal=Paper presented at the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council Committee on Human Factors|date=September 1983|location=Monterey, CA}}</ref><ref name=fourteen>{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=G.

L.|title=Simulator sickness scores according to symptom susceptibility, age, and gender for an older driver assessment study|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|date=2006|volume=50|pages=2702<U+2013>2706|doi=10.1177/154193120605002607}}</ref><ref name=fifteen>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=R. S.|last2=Lilienthal|first2=M. G.|last3=Berbaum|first3=K. S.|last4=Baltzley|first4=D. R.|last5=McCauley|first5=M. E.|title=Simulator sickness in U.S. Navy flight simulators|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=1989|volume=60|pages=10<U+2013>16}}</ref>  This may be due to hormonal differences,<ref name=thirteen /><ref name=fifteen /> or it may be because women have a wider field of view than men.<ref name=thirteen />  Women are most susceptible to virtual reality sickness during the ovulatory period of their menstrual cycle,<ref name=sixteen>{{cite journal|last1=Clemes|first1=S. A.|last2=Howarth|first2=P. A.|title=The menstrual cycle and susceptibility to virtual simulator sickness|journal=Journal of Biological Rhythms|date=2005|volume=20|pages=71<U+2013>82|doi=10.1177/0748730404272567}}</ref> but a wider field of view is also associated with an increase in virtual reality sickness.<ref name=seventeen>{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=R. S.|last2=Berbaum|first2=K. S.|last3=Lilienthal|first3=M. G.|last4=Dunlap|first4=W. P.|last5=Mulligan|first5=B. F.|last6=Funaro|first6=J. F.|title=Guidelines for alleviation of simulator sickness symptomatology (NAVTRASYSCEN TR-87007)|date=1987|publisher=Naval Training Systems Center|location=Orlando, FL}}</ref>
* Health: Susceptibility to virtual reality sickness appears to increase in people who are not at their usual level of health, suggesting that virtual reality may not be appropriate for people who are in ill health.<ref name=seventeen />  This includes people who are fatigued; have not had enough sleep; are nauseated; or have an upper respiratory illness, ear trouble, or influenza.<ref name=two /><ref name=eighteen>{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=D. E.|last2=Harm|first2=D. L.|title=Mental rotation: A key to mitigation of motion sickness in the virtual environment?|journal=Presence|date=1992|volume=1|pages=329<U+2013>333}}</ref>
* Mental Rotation Ability: Better mental rotation ability appears to reduce susceptibility to virtual reality sickness, suggesting that training users in mental rotation may reduce the incidence of virtual reality sickness.<ref name=eighteen />  
* Field Dependence/Independence: Field dependence/independence is a measure of perceptual style.  Those with strong field dependence exhibit a strong influence of surrounding environment on their perception of an object, whereas people with strong field independence show a smaller influence of surrounding environment on their perception of the object.  While the relationship between field dependence/independence and virtual reality sickness is complex, it appears that, in general, people without a strong tendency towards one extreme or the other are most susceptible to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=five />
* Motion Sickness Sensitivity: Those who are more sensitive to motion sickness in reality are also more sensitive to virtual reality sickness.<ref name=twentytwo />
