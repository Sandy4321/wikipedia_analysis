[[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i|Shafi`i]], who was one of Malik's students for nine years and a scholarly giant in his own right, stated, "when scholars are mentioned, Malik is the star."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islaam.com/Article.aspx?id=530 |title=The Life and Times of Malik ibn Anas |publisher=Islaam.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref>  The [[Maliki]] [[Madhab]], named after Malik, is one of the four schools of jurisprudence that are followed by Sunni  [[Muslims]] to this day.

==Biography==
His full name was ''Abu Abdullah M<U+0101>lik ibn Anas ibn M<U+0101>lik Ibn Ab<U+012B> '<U+0100>mir Ibn 'Amr Ibnul-H<U+0101>rith Ibn Ghaim<U+0101>n Ibn Khuthail
Ibn 'Amr Ibnul-Haarith''.

Malik was born the son of Anas ibn Malik ('''not''' [[Anas ibn Malik|the Sahabi]]) and Aaliyah bint Shurayk al-Azdiyya in [[Medina]] circa 711. His family was originally from the al-Asbahi tribe of [[Yemen]], but his great grandfather Abu 'Amir relocated the family to Medina after converting to [[Islam]] in the second year of the [[Hijri calendar]], or 623 CE. According to [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]], he was tall, heavyset, imposing of stature, very fair, with white hair and beard but bald, with a huge beard and blue eyes.<ref name="Sunnah.org"/>

===Teachers===
Living in Medina gave Malik access to some of the most learned minds of early Islam.  He [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorized the Quran]] in his youth, learning recitation from [[Abu Suhail Nafi' ibn 'Abd ar-Rahman]], from whom he also received his [[Ijazah]], or certification and permission to teach others. He studied under various famed scholars including [[Hisham ibn Urwah]], [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], and <U+2014> along with [[Abu Hanifa]], the founder of the [[Hanafi Sunni]] [[Madh'hab]]- and under the household of the prophets lineage, [[Jafar al Sadiq]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=471 |title=<U+2013> Topics |publisher=Muslimheritage.com |date=2005-01-04 |accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref>  This fact may explain the mutual respect and relative peace that has often existed between the Hanafi and Maliki Sunnis, on one hand, and the Shias on the other.

===Golden Chain of Narration===
Malik's [[Isnad|chain]] of narrators was considered the most authentic and called ''Silsilat ul-Zhahab'' or "The Golden Chain of Narrators" by notable hadith scholars including [[Muhammad al-Bukhari]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0041.htm |title="Imaam Maalik ibn Anas" by Hassan Ahmad, '&#39;<U+2018>Al Jumuah<U+2019> Magazine'&#39; Volume 11 <U+2013> Issue 9 |publisher=Sunnahonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-10}}</ref> The 'Golden Chain' of narration (i.e., that considered by the scholars of Hadith to be the most authentic) consists of Malik, who narrated from [[Nafi`|Nafi']], who narrated from [[Ibn Umar]], who narrated from [[Muhammad]].

===Mention in Hadith===
The Muslim prophet Muhammad reportedly said said in a hadith authenticated by [[Muhammad ibn `Isa at-Tirmidhi]]: <U+201C>Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge, and they shall find no-one more knowledgeable than the knowledgeable scholar of Madina.<U+201D> [[Qadi Ayyad]], [[Al-Dhahabi]] and others relate from [[Sufyan ibn `Uyaynah]], [[<U+2018>Abd ar-Razzaq as-San<U+2018>ani]], Ibn Mahdi, [[Yahya ibn Ma'in]], Dhu<U+2019>ayb ibn `Imama, Ibn al-Madini, and others that they considered that scholar to be Malik ibn Anas.<ref>http://eshaykh.com/hadith/hadith-abour-imam-malik-r/</ref>

==Views==

===Reluctance in rendering religious verdicts===
Malik took advantage of the fact that he was contemporary to many of the [[Tabi<U+2018>in]] to formulate his school of thought, which gave precedence to the acts of the people of [[Medina]] over the [[Hadith]] if they were in conflict.  This was done due to the sizeable amount of scholars, and companions of [[Muhammad]] residing in the city where Malik's reputation grew immensely. Malik nevertheless showed hesitancy in issuing religious verdicts explaining in one of his more famous statements that:<blockquote>The shield of the scholar is, 'I do not know,' so if he neglects it, his statement is attacked.<ref>Al-Intiqaa, pg. 38</ref></blockquote>

===Textualist interpretation of hadith on God's attributes===
Malik adhered to a [[Athari|textual interpretation]] of hadith in relation to God's attributes.  Al-Daraqutni relates that Malik was asked about the attributes of [[Allah]], to which Malik answered, "Pass them on as they come."<ref>as-Siffat, pg.75</ref>  Furthermore, [[Qadi Iyad]] relates that Malik was asked whether people would be looking toward [[Allah]] given the narration, "And some faces shall be shining and radiant upon that day, looking at their Lord."  Malik ensuingly answered, "Yes, with these two eyes of his," though his student replied, "there are a people who say he will not be looking at Allah, that 'looking' means a reward" to which Malik answered, "They lied, rather they will look at Allah."

===Opposition to bid'ah or innovation in beliefs===
Malik was vehemently opposed to bid'ah and even directed others not to extend the Islamic greeting of [[S-L-M|Salam]] to the people of [[bidah]], stating, "how evil are the People of Innuendo, we do not give them felicitations."<ref>al-Ibaanah of ibn Battah, no.441</ref> Malik explained that "he who establishes an innovation in Islam regarding it as something good, has claimed that Muhammad has betrayed his trust to deliver the message as God says, 'this day have I perfected for you your religion'. And whatsoever was not part of the religion then, is not part of the religion today."<ref>al-I'tisaam</ref>

===Prohibiting Kalam===
Malik sternly prohibited theological rhetoric and philosophical speech, frequently referred to as [[kalam]].<ref>Dhammul-Kalaam (qaaf/173/alif)</ref> Malik believed that [[Kalam]] was rooted in heretical doctrines taken up and followed by controversial theologians such as [[Jahm bin Safwan]].<ref>Jaami' Bayaanul-Ilm wa Fadlihi (p. 415)</ref>  When asked about an individual who delved into Kalam, Malik answered, "He establishes his innuendo with kalaam, and if kalaam had been knowledge, the [[Sahaba|Companions]] and the [[tabi'in]] would have spoken about it, just as they spoke about the rules and regulations.<ref>Dhammul-Kalaam (qaaf/173/baa)</ref>

==Death==
Imam Malik died at the age of 84 in [[Medina]] in 795 and is buried in the famous [[Jannat ul-Baqi]] cemetery across from the [[Masjid al Nabawi]].  Malik's last words were related by one Isma'il Ibn Abi Uways who said, "Malik became sick, so I asked some of our people about what he said at the time of his death. They said, `He recited the [[shahadah]] (testification of faith), then he recited:<blockquote>Their affair is for Allah, before and after.<ref>Quran 30:4</ref></blockquote>

==Works==
Imam Malik wrote: 
*''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]]'', "The Approved," which was said to have been regarded by Shafi'i to be the soundest book on [[Earth]] after the [[Qur'an]].
*''Al-Mudawwana al-Kubra'', written down by [[Sahnun|Sahnun ibn Sa'id ibn Habib at-Tanukhi]] (c. 776-7 <U+2013> 854-5) after the death of Malik ibn Anas.

==Reforming the Umayyad rule from the inside==

One of Muawiyah's most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor. Yazid was experienced militarily, after taking part in various expeditions and the siege of Constantinople but politically inexperienced. Marwan also wanted Yazid to be the Caliph so that he could run things behind the scenes, as he would become the senior member of the Umayyad clan after Muawiyah's death. Mohammad, Abu Bakr and Umar also mistrusted Marwan and he had lived in Taif during their rule, where he became friends with Hajjaj.

Tom Holland writes "Tempers in Medina were not helped by the fact that the governor in the oasis was none other than the fabulously venal and slippery Marwan. Rumours abounded that it was he, back in the last calamitous days of Uthman's rule who had double crossed the war band that had come to Uthman. The locals mistrust of their governor ran particularly deep. Nothing he had done had helped to improve his reputation for double dealing.<ref>The shadow of the sword, The Battle for Global Empire and the End of the Ancient World By Tom Holland, ISBN 978-0-349-12235 Abacus Page 409</ref>

The appointment of Yazid was unpopular in Madina. Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 352, Narrated by Yusuf bin Mahak:

Marwan had been appointed as the governor of Hijaz by Muawiya. He delivered a sermon and mentioned Yazid bin Muawiya so that the people might take the oath of allegiance to him as the successor of his father (Muawiya). Then 'Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr told him something whereupon marwan ordered that he be arrested. But 'Abdur-Rahman entered 'Aisha's house and they could not arrest him. marwan said, "It is he ('AbdurRahman) about whom Allah revealed this Verse: 'And the one who says to his parents: 'Fie on you! Do you hold out the promise to me..?'" On that, 'Aisha said from behind a screen, "Allah did not reveal anything from the Qur'an about us except what was connected with the declaration of my innocence (of the slander)."{{Primary source-inline|date=July 2013}}{{third-party-inline|date=July 2013}}

Ibn Katheer wrote in his book the Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah <ref name="ReferenceA">The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 82</ref>
that "in the year 56 AH Muawiyah called on the people including those within the outlying territories to pledge allegiance to his son, Yazeed, to be his heir to the Caliphate after him. Almost all the subjects offered their allegiance, with the exception of Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr (the son of Abu Bakr), [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] (the son of Umar), al-Husain bin Ali (the son of Ali), Abdullah bin Az-Zubair (The grandson of Abu Bakr) and Abdullah ibn Abbas (Ali's cousin). Because of this Muawiyah passed through al-Madinah on his way back from Makkah upon completion of his Umrah Pilgrimage where he summoned each one of the five aforementioned individuals and threatened them. The speaker who addressed Muawiyah sharply with the greatest firmness amongst them was Abdurrahman bin Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, while Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab was the most soft spoken amongst them.

Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr and [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] were mid level Muslim commanders at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] that took Syria. Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr sister [[Asm<U+0101>' bint Abu Bakr]] also fought in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and was opposed to Yazid.<ref>Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Page 352-353 [http://www.kalamullah.com/conquest-of-syria.html]</ref> Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr had been one of the first to dual in that battle, after taking a sword to hand over to a Qays bin Hubayrah who had lost his sword, while in a dual with the Roman Army's best horseman. Two more Roman horsemen then came forward saying "We see no justice when two of you come against one of us." Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr replied "I only came to give my companion a sword and then return. Were 100 of you to come out against one of us we would not be worried. You are now three men. I am enough to take on all three of you". After which he took down the Roman horsemen on his own.<ref>Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Page 313 [http://www.kalamullah.com/conquest-of-syria.html]</ref> After seeing this, Bannes the Roman general said "Caesar really knew these people best. I now know that a difficult situation is to come on you. If you do not attack them with great numbers, you will have no chance". [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] had also been a mid level commander in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]]. Some Roman soldiers went to the house of Abu al-Jaid a local Christian in az-Zura ah and after eating all the food, raped his wife and killed his son.<ref name="kalamullah.com">Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Page 358 [http://www.kalamullah.com/conquest-of-syria.html]</ref> His wife complained to the roman general and he ignored her. Abu al-Jaid then went to the Muslims and told them that he knows the local area and if the Muslims exempt him and his descendents from taxes for ever he will help them defeat the Roman army.<ref name="kalamullah.com"/> He then took horse men led by [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] to the Roman camp at night and attacked them and then ran away. The Romans chased them and in the dark tens of thousands of them fell down a cliff at the an-Naqusah Creek into a river.<ref>Islamic Conquest of Syria A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Page 359 [http://www.kalamullah.com/conquest-of-syria.html]</ref> Abdullah bin Az-Zubair had also been a commander in various battles including in North Africa and was also involved in the [[siege of Constantinople]].

Muawiyah then delivered a sermon, having stood these five men below the pulpit in full view of the people after which the people pledged allegiance to Yazeed as they stood in silence without displaying their disagreement or opposition for fear of being humiliated. Saeed bin Uthman bin Affan, the son of Uthman also criticized Muawiyah for putting forward Yazeed.".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> They tolerated Muawiyah but did not like Yazeed.

The following year Muawiyah removed Marwan bin al Hakam from the position of Governor in Madina and appointed al-Waleed bin Utbah bin Abi Sufyan.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 83</ref>

According to some sources Muawiyah warned his son Yazid against mistreating Hussein. His final warning to Yazid was: 
"As for Husayn what can I tell you concerning him? Be careful not to confront him except in a good way. Extend to him a free hand (literally, a long rope) and let him roam the earth as he pleases. Do not harm him, can show verbal anger but never confront him with the weapons of war but rather bestow on him generous gifts. Give him a place of honor near you and treat him with due reverence. Be careful O my son, that you do not meet God with his blood, lest you be amongst those that will perish"<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GnfrQCbGSMAC&pg=PA24&dq=Muawiyah&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Mie6UcikMMqH0AX0y4GIBw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Muawiyah&f=false] Hosay Trinidad: Muharram Performances in an Indo-Caribbean Diaspora

Yazeed and Hussein knew each other well and had both been involved in the Siege of Constantinople.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 135</ref> Many years later, after the events in Karbala when the governor of Kufa, Ibn Ziyad sent the head of Hussein to Yazeed. The Servant of Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan is reported to have said: "When Yazeed came with al-Husain's head and placed it in his hands, I saw Yazeed crying and he said: 'If there had been any relationship between Ibn Ziyad and al-Husain then he would not have done this (referring to Ibn Ziyad).'"<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 152</ref>

After Hussein was killed Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair expelled Yazids forces from Hijaz and the Kharijites got stronger in Iraq. Yazid died a few months later in young age and his son did not want to take part in a civil war against Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair and abdicated and later died.

After years of planning and scheming and making every one else fight, Marwan came to power in Syria and the Qurra (the Kharijites) established a state in Southern Iraq. The very thing Hassan signed a treaty with Muawiyah to avoid.

Now there were three camps, the Scholars in Madina, the Kharijites in Iraq and Umayyads in Syria.

In Sahih Al Bukhari the people still referred to the Kharijites by their old name Qurra and most Muslims resented these civil wars and felt that the Arabs had left the teachings of Muhammad and gone back to their old ways of fighting over wealth.

Sahih Al Bukhari Volume 9, Book 88, Number 228:<ref>[http://www.sahih-bukhari.com/Pages/Bukhari_9_88.php]</ref> 
Narrated by Abu Al-Minhal

When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra' (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, "O Abu Barza! Don't you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?" The first thing heard him saying "I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain."

Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair then sent his brother to Iraq to take on the Kharijites who were by then getting stronger. This depleted Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair forces and he was later defeated by the Syrians.

Ibn Zubayr was finally defeated by [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], who sent [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]]. Hajjaj defeated and killed Ibn Zubayr on the battlefield in 692.

On his last hour he asked his mother [[Asm<U+0101>' bint Abu Bakr]] what he should do. [[Asm<U+0101>' bint Abu Bakr]] replied to her son, she said:<ref>[http://www.ummah.com/forum/showthread.php?347728-The-Advice-of-Asmaa-bint-Abu-Bakr-(ra)-to-her-son-Abdullah-Ibn-Zubair-(ra)]</ref> ''"You know better in your own self that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth for people more honourable than you were killed and have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are, you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say what you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others then you will not truly be free, for this is not the statement of someone who is free"''.
 
Then [[Asm<U+0101>' bint Abu Bakr]] said to her son, this is the statement of the mother to her son, ''"how long will you live in this world, death is more beloved to me than this state you are on/ this state of weakness"''.
 
Then this conversation between Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and his mother continued.
 
Then Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr said to his mother after she had told him to go forth and fight.
 
He said, ''"I am afraid I will be mutilated by the people of Sham, I am afraid that they will cut up my body after they have killed me"''.
 
So she said to her son, ''"after someone has died it won't make any difference what they do to you if you have been killed"''. Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then said to his mother, ''"I did not come to you except to increase myself in knowledge"''.
 
He said to her, ''"I did not come to you except to increase me in knowledge, look and pay attention to this day for verily I am a dead man, your son never drank wine, nor was he fornicator, nor did he wrong any Muslim or Non Muslim, nor was he unjust, I am not saying this to you to show off or show how pure I am but rather as an honour to you"''.
 
So then  Abdullah Ibn Zubair  left by himself on his horse and he was killed by the Army of Hajjaj and when he was killed by the Army of Hajjaj all the Army said <U+201C>Allah hu Akhbar<U+201D> and Abdullah Ibn Omer heard this and he said,<U+201D> how strange is it that this man when he was born all of the Muslims said <U+201C>Allah hu Akhbar<U+201D> and now that he is killed everyone is also saying <U+201C>Allah hu Akhbar<U+201D>.
 
Asma refused to go and ask permission to put down her sons body and it was said to her, ''"if you don't go his body will remain like that. So she said let it be then"''.
 
Until eventually, Hajjaj came to her and said, ''"what do you say about this matter"'' and Asma was in her old age and blind by then. Asma said, ''"Verily you have destroyed him you have ruined his life and with that you have ruined your hereafter"''. Asma died a few days later.

Ibn Katheer says that Abdullah Ibn Umar resented the conduct of some of the Ummayad rulers and governors like Hajjaj. Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam who lived near that time, said in his book the first biography on Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz that Abdullah Ibn Omar's niece was married to one of Marwans son called Abdul Aziz who lived in Madina.<ref name="ReferenceB">Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi</ref> Abdul Aziz lived in Madina and had not become an Umayyad ruler, but he had a young son called Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz. Abdullah ibn Umar kept Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz with him for his education when Abdul Aziz and his wife moved to Egypt. Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was educated in Madina. The scholars in Madina including Abdullah Ibn Umar and [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] who was jafar Sadiqs grandfather and Abu Bakr's grandson felt that they could use Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz to peacefully reform the Umayyad rule.

Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam (died 214 AH) wrote that many years earlier: "During the time of Umar Ibn al Khattab the (second Caliph) he prohibit the sale of milk mixed with water. One night, he came out for some need at the outskirts of Madinah. Suddenly, he heard the voice of a woman. She was telling her daughter, "Daughter, you have not yet mixed water in the milk. It is nearly dawn. " The daughter said, "How can I mix water in the milk? Amir ul Muminin has prohibited it". The mother said, "Other people also mix it. You also mix it. How does Amir ul Muminin know?" The daughter replied. "If Umar does not know, then the creator of Umar knows. Once he has prohibited it, then I cannot do it."

Umar was greatly pleased with this conversation. When morning came, he called his son Asim and narrated the incident that took place at night. He then said, "Go and find out who that girl is". Asim went. He made enquiries and found out that the girl was from the tribe of Banu Hilal. He returned and informed Umar. He said to Asim "Son, go and get married to her. Definitely, she is worthy of bearing a horseman who will lead the entire Arabia."

Consequently Asim married her and a daughter Umm e Asim bint Asim Ibn Umar Ibn al Khattab was born from her. Umm e Asim got married to Adbul Aziz bint Marwan bin al Hakam. Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was born from her.<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 35-36</ref>

After his education, Raja bin Haiwah who was also a scholar and an advisor to some of the Umayyad rulers took Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz to Syria. Raja bin Haiwah also worked closely with the scholars in Madina. Ibn Katheer wrote in his book the Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah that during the time of Abdul Malik, Raja bin Haiwah also managed the finances for the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, that stands to this day.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 265</ref>

Ibn Katheer wrote that even the Umayyad ruler Al-Waleed bin Abdul Malik would write to Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz in Madina for advice on legal matter. Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz would then convene a meeting with the jurists in Madina and they would all decide on the reply.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 414</ref>

Later the future Ummayad ruler Sulaiman would also consult Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz. Hajjaj opposed Sulaiman from becoming Caliph, even through his father had wrote in his will that after his brother Al-Waleed bin Abdul Malik, Sulaiman would be Caliph. So Sulaiman became even closer to Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz who also opposed Hajjaj.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

When Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz was made the governor of Madina, he asked the Khalifah that he wished to be excused from Hajjaj coming to Madinah. After which, Hajjaj was prevented from going to Madina.<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 46</ref>

According to Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam from Madina (died 214 AH 829 C.E) Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz then said to the ruler Walid Ibn Abdul Malik "After ascribing partners to Allah, there is no greater sin than spilling blood. Your governors are unjustifiably killing people and they only write the crime of the killed person (murder) to inform you. You will be answerable for this and you will be held accountable (by God). Therefore, write to your governors telling them that no one should be punished by death, but they should write of the crime to you. There should be witnesses to it, then you should decide on that punishment to be meted out after great thought and deliberation" Walid said "O Abu Hafs (He called Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, Abu Hafs), May Allah grant you blessings in your life and delay your demise. Bring the pen and paper." Walid then wrote this command to all the governors. Besides Hajjaj, no one found it difficult. It weighed heavily on him and he became very agitated. He thought that no one else besides him got this command. He investigated and found that he was wrong. He said "Where did this calamity come from? Who told this to Walid?" he was told that 'Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz was responsible for this. When he heard this he said, "Oh, if the one who gave this consultation is Umar, then it is not permissible to reject it".<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 203-204</ref>

The ruler Sulayman Ibn Abdul Malik said to Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz "Look how many people gather during the Hajj season." He replied "Amir ul Mu minin, all of them are your plaintiffs" (They will complain about you in the court of Allah on the Day of judgment)<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 225</ref>

According to Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam who lived near that time and later Ibn Katheer said that Ibn Jareer said that, Raja bin Haiwah (who was also a scholar) the minister of marriage, for the Ummayad ruler Sulaiman said that when Sulaiman was on his death bed, I told him "Indeed amongst the things that preserves the caliph in his grave is his appointment of a righteous man over the muslims." So he wrote a letter appointing the scholar from Madina, Umar bin Abdul Azeez. To allow the Ummayads to accept this, Raja then advised him to make his brother Yazeed bin Adbul Malik the successor after Umar bin Abdul Azeez.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 505</ref><ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 54-59</ref> Umar bin Abdul Azeez was a grand son of Omar, the second Caliph from his mothers side. After his appointment he set up a committee of the jurist in Madina headed by [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]] and it included [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]], Ubaidullah bin Abdullah bin Utbah, Abu Bakr bin Abdur-Rahman bin al-Harith bin Hisham, Abu Bakr bin Sulaiman bin Abu Hathmah, Sulaiman bin Yasar, Salim bin Abdullah, Abdullah bin Amir bin Rabee'ah and Kharijah bin Zaid bin Thabit, in Madina to advise on legal matters.<ref>The Caliphate of Banu Umayyah the first Phase, Ibn Katheer, Taken from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah by Ibn Katheer, Ismail Ibn Omar 775 HISBN 978-603-500-080-2 Translated by Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad Page 522</ref> The work of Malik ibn Anas and successive jurists is also based on the work of this early committee in Madina. Malik ibn Anas also refers to these Fuqaha' of Madina.<ref>[http://bewley.virtualave.net/ulama.html]</ref> Madina at the time had the largest number of Muhammad's companions therefore no one could lie about what Muhammad had said, while in Madina during that period. After becoming the Khalif, Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz worked very closely with the scholars in Madina to make the laws in line with the Quran and the teachings of Muhammad's. He also reduced the allowances of the Umayyad family members. Which they deeply resented.

When Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz reduced the allowances of the Umayyad family members. They sent some one to him to ask for more. When Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz refused, the man said to them "O Banu Umayyah, you should rebuke yourself. You got up and married a person of your family to the grand daughter of Umar. He wrapped Umar in a cloth and presented him to you. You should therefore rebuke yourself".<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam  died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 84-85</ref>

Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz also started peace talks with the Kharijites. He then reduced the taxes for the Muslims. He sacked oppressive governors and replaced them.<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 220-221</ref> His policies made him very popular with the population but not so popular with the Umayyads. The reduction in the taxes also reduced further expeditions and the expansion of the state. But lower taxes and better justice allowed the economy to expand. The tax collector Yahya Ibn Sa'id complained that after collecting the taxes, he could not find people willing to take the charity from the welfare state<ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 171</ref>

Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam (died 214 AH) writes that Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz then stopped the allowance of the Banu Umayyah, stopped giving them land and made them the same as every one else. And they complained bitterly. So Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz said to them "By Allah, I want that no impermissible decision should remain on the earth that I will not finish off." <ref>Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz By Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam died 214 AH 829 C.E. Publisher Zam Zam Publishers Karachi Page 221</ref>

According to Imam Abu Muhammad Adbullah ibn Abdul Hakam who lived near that time and later Ibn Katheer, Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was soon killed, but when the future rulers tried to reverse his policies, the population started to rebel.

With the death of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz the scholars in Madina got very upset. But in the short time Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz was in power the changes he made, had a long lasting effect in the minds of the people. An associate of Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, [[Zayd ibn Ali]] the grandson of Husayns was also very upset. [[Zayd ibn Ali]] then started receiving letters from Kufa asking him to come to Kufa. In 740, [[Abu Hanifah]] supported his friend [[Zayd ibn Ali]] against an Umayyad ruler but asked his friend not to go to Kufa. [[Abu Hanifah]], Malik ibn Anas and [[Zayd ibn Ali]]'s family advised [[Zayd ibn Ali]] not to go to Kufa feared that Zayd ibn Ali would get betrayed in [[Kufa]].<ref name=Najeebabadi>{{Harvtxt|Najeebabadi|2001|loc=Vol 2|p=229}} [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=duAhUE684bwC&pg=PA229&dq=zayd+ibn+ali+betrayed&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ahgEUdq8KefG0QW0uYF4&sqi=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=zayd%20ibn%20ali%20betrayed&f=false]</ref><ref name="books.google.co.uk">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rI4VAQAAIAAJ&q=zayd+ibn+ali+betrayed&dq=zayd+ibn+ali+betrayed&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ahgEUdq8KefG0QW0uYF4&sqi=2&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ Tarikh al-madhahib al-fiqhiyah - Page 114]</ref><ref name=IslamReDefined>Islam re-defined: an intelligent man's guide towards understanding Islam - Page 54 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2HpIAAAAMAAJ&q=zayd+ibn+ali+betrayed&dq=zayd+ibn+ali+betrayed&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CRsEUZrEIvOM0wXfrICQBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwATgK]</ref><ref name=ElFadl72>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JhvPnC5NnzMC&pg=PA72&dq=abu+hanifa+Zayd+ibn+Ali++prison&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Or79ULqxGYTG0QXEvoHgDA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=abu%20hanifa%20Zayd%20ibn%20Ali%20%20prison&f=false Rebellion and Violence in Islamic Law By Khaled Abou El Fadl page 72]</ref> But [[Zayd ibn Ali]] felt that he needed to oppose the Umayyads by force. [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydis]] believe that on his arrival in Kufa, on the last hour of [[Zayd ibn Ali]], the people in Kufa asked him: "May God have mercy on you! What do you have to say on the matter of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]?" [[Zayd ibn Ali]] said, "I have not heard anyone in my family renouncing them both nor saying anything but good about them...when they were entrusted with government they behaved justly with the people and acted according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah.".<ref name="Tabar<U+012B>, Carole Hillenbrand 1989, p37">''The waning of the Umayyad caliphate'' by Tabar<U+012B>, Carole Hillenbrand, 1989, p37, p38</ref><ref name="Religion Vol 1987, p243">''The Encyclopedia of Religion'' Vol.16, Mircea Eliade, Charles J.

After which they withdrew their support <ref name="Najeebabadi"/><ref name=Najeebabadi/><ref name="books.google.co.uk"/><ref name="IslamReDefined"/><ref name="ElFadl72"/> and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] fought bravely against the Umayyad army but was killed. The Scholars kept up the pressure on the Umayyads and as the Umayyads tried to re-impose the taxes abolished by Umar Ibn Adbul Aziz, the population also got more rebellious.

Later the Abbasids came to power and they tried to change the laws so that they could be above the law, in 767 [[Abu Hanifah]] died in prison when he refused to support the Abbasid ruler [[Al-Mansur]] and Malik ibn Anas was flogged.<ref>[http://sunnahonline.com/library/biographies/309-malik SunnahOnline.com - Malik ibn 'Anas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name="BVpaCu7XA8C page 221">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cBVpaCu7XA8C&pg=PA221&dq=imam+malik+flogged&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RYz-UMrVBMec0AXqlIDYDA&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=imam%20malik%20flogged&f=false Decline of Muslim States and Societies By Misbah Islam page 221]</ref> But then the Abbasids backed off and allowed the laws of Madina to be implemented again and the book [[Muwatta Imam Malik]] of Malik ibn Anas based on the laws based on the Quran and the example of Muhammad and based on the work of the committee of the main jurist in Madina headed by [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]], who was jafar Sadiq's grandfather and Abu Bakr's grandson were again implemented.

Later the Abbasids tried to impose the mutazilite philosophy so that they could change the laws, so that they could present them selves as being above the law. Imam Ahmed Hanbal confronted a ruler and was tortured and sent to an unlit [[Baghdad]] prison cell for nearly thirty months.<ref>Shariah: The Islamic Law By Abdur Rahman page=110 Published year=1984 publisher=Ta-Ha Publishers in London isbn= 0-907461-38-7</ref>

In 767 [[Abu Hanifah]] had died in prison when he refused to support the Abbasid ruler [[Al-Mansur]]<ref name="BVpaCu7XA8C page 221"/><ref>[http://sunnahonline.com/library/biographies/309-malik SunnahOnline.com - Malik ibn 'Anas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but later the mutazilite philosophy failed and the Hanifi jurisprudence was implemented. Since  Imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]] and Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] worked with Imam [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Abu Hanifa]] wrote books at that time, the Zaidi's and originally the Fatimid's used the Hanifi jurisprudence. In terms of law, the modern Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school<ref>Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, A short History of the Yemenite Shi<U+2018>ites (2005)</ref>

These scholars also laid the foundations of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world]] and some scientists and Mathematicians on the [[List of Muslim scientists]] were taught by these scholars, they then taught other scholars. Islam discourages the belief in superstition. Hence these scholars felt that humans could truly appreciate God magnificence, by studying Gods creation.

All the Muslims follow the Quran and the example of Muhammad. The differences between the denominations in Islam are primarily political. The Sunnis give more importance to the Quran and the books containing the hadith, examples of Muhammad, but since all the early scholars and all the four caliphs worked together, the Sunnis accept all the first four caliphs, as they were elected by the community. They also accept all the early imams (scholars) for their knowledge. While the Shias who constitute around 10-20% of the Muslims are more hereditary and only accept Ali the fourth caliph, accept Hassan and only accept certain male descendent of Ali through his son Hussein as imams. But different branches of Shia accept different brothers.

Some of the elite in the old empires of the Middle East felt discontented with the passage of their empires and did not like the Arab Caliphs, their ideas eventually found their way into the religious differences. During the Abbasid period, many history books were also written as a reference for future generations, recording everything people were saying about the early history of Islam. They were not subject to the same level of authenticity checks. In many cases the preislamic customs of the populations that converted to Islam were also absorbed into their rituals.<ref>A Brief History of Saudi Arabia By James Wynbrandt page 64</ref> This also amplified the differences. During the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]] the Byzantines benefited when there were political disagreements between the Muslims and used the time to establishment of the [[themata]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Rahman|1999|p=58}}</ref> Some of the ideas of the [[kharijites]] who were initially very extreme in their support of Ali's caliphate, but later killed Ali when he made peace with [[Mu'awiyah]] also lived on.

Ali according to both the Sunni and the Shia books was against sectarianism. The following sermon of Ali exists in both the Sunni and the Shia books.

"Ali says: With regard to me, two categories of people will be ruined, namely he who loves me too much and the love takes him away from rightfulness, and he who hates me too much and the hatred takes him away from rightfulness. The best man with regard to me is he who is on the middle course. So be with him and be with the great majority of Muslims because Allah<U+2019>s hand of protection is on keeping unity. You should beware of division because the one isolated from the group is a prey to Satan just as the one isolated from the flock of sheep is a prey to the wolf. Beware! Whoever calls to this course of sectarianism, even though he may be under this headband of mine."<ref>Nahjul Balagha, Sermon 126</ref>

After the Mongolian invasion and the subsequent reduction in the literacy rates, people began to label them selves as belonging to denominations rather than actually reading the books of these scholars.

The differences amplified after the Safavid invasion of Persia and the subsequent [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]] due to the politics between the [[Safavids]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>The Heirs Of The Prophet Muhammad: And The Roots Of The Sunni-Shia Schism By Barnaby Rogerson [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ExbdVf5fFmUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sunni+shia&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ap35UMrvOo7s0gW52oH4DA&sqi=2&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg]</ref> To consolidate their position, the Safavid's also exploited the deep rooted differences between areas formally under the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] and areas formally under the [[Byzantine]] Roman Empire. Differences that existing from the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] and the [[Byzantine-Sassanid Wars]]. Under the oppressive rule of [[Yazid I]], some Muslims began to think that if [[Hussein ibn Ali]] the descendent of Muhammad was their ruler, he would have been more just. However later a minority, took this concept one step further and also started thinking, what if history took a different course and these ideas were later odopted by some Shia and institutionalised by the [[Safavids]]. For the first time in the history of Islam, the [[Safavids]] also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and funded this hierarchy through the collection of [[waqf]] and [[Khums]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qmVUg_qHr2AC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=safavids+hierarchical+organization+of+the+Shiite+clergy&source=bl&ots=yQYqqIu6UF&sig=JiYPWQTP1k2219extxIdBSdlOsY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7zMWUfGNCMrU0QW3-ICQBw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=safavids%20hierarchical%20organization%20of%20the%20Shiite%20clergy&f=false The History of Iran By Elton L.

After witnessing what happens due to the lust for wealth and power, others like [[Hasan of Basra]] advocated piety and the condemnation of worldliness which later influenced the development of the Sufis. It was further developed by [[Al-Ghazali]].
