'''Pearl Laska Chamberlain''' (n<U+00E9>e Bragg, April 29, 1909 - November 22, 2012) learned to fly in a Kinner Fleet bi-plane in 1933 and held a pilot<U+2019>s certificate until she was 97.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AmsbqOP1TYUC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=pearl+laska&source=bl&ots=icKFIqg7tx&sig=XzbTAZz6dW4hLhq3k7HDAcSIVps&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3Na2UOnBHKXoiAKxvoCACg&ved=0CGAQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&q=pearl%20laska&f=false |title=Women Pilots Of Alaska: 37 Interviews And Profiles - Sandi Sumner - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2005-01-31 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref> 
Prior to World War II, the federal government established the Civilian Flight Training Program, a back-door method to train pilots for military service.

She was a W.A.S.P ([[Women Airforce Service Pilots]]) trainee during the war and was honorably discharged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twudigital.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p214coll2&CISOPTR=3730&CISOBOX=1&REC=9 |title=Digital Collections : Item Viewer |publisher=Twudigital.cdmhost.com |date=2004-10-02 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref> 
In 1945, following her dream to be a full-time pilot, Pearl moved to Nome, Alaska and worked as a flight instructor and bush pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jukebox.uaf.edu/aviators/chamberlain_pearl/HTML/testimonybrowseraudioonly.html |title=Pearl Laska Chamberlain |publisher=Jukebox.uaf.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref>
The next year she became the first woman to solo a single-engine airplane (a 1939 Piper J4) up the Alaska Highway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewislaska.com/pearl.htm |title=Pearl Laska Chamberlain |publisher=Lewislaska.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref> 
The FAA recognized her achievements as a pioneer Alaska aviator in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskajournal.com/Alaska-Journal-of-Commerce/February-2005/Alaska-Briefs/ |title=Alaska Briefs - Alaska Journal of Commerce - February Issue 1 2005 - Anchorage, AK |publisher=Alaskajournal.com |date=2005-02-20 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}</ref> 
Scorning the belief that Alaska Natives (Eskimos, etc.) were unable to learn flying, she taught many, including Holger Jorgensen, who became the first Native hired as a pilot by a scheduled air line.<ref>[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/field_offices/fsdo/fai/local_more/Pilot_Infonews/biography/media/LaskaPearle.pdf Pilot Infonews biography]</ref>
