'''''Willow''''' is a 1988 American [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Ron Howard]] and produced/co-written by [[George Lucas]]. [[Warwick Davis]] stars in the film, as well as [[Val Kilmer]], [[Joanne Whalley]], [[Jean Marsh]], and [[Patricia Hayes]]. With a [[sword and sorcery]] setting, Davis stars as the eponymous lead character and hero Willow, a reluctant farmer who plays a critical role in protecting a special baby from a tyrannical queen.

Lucas conceived the idea for ''Willow'' in 1972, approaching Howard to direct during the [[post-production]] phase of ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' in 1985. Lucas believed he and Howard shared a relationship similar to the one Lucas enjoyed with [[Steven Spielberg]]. [[Bob Dolman]] was brought in to write the screenplay, coming up with seven drafts before finishing in late 1986. ''Willow'' was then set up at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[principal photography]] began in April 1987, finishing the following October.

The majority of filming took place at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, as well as [[Wales]] and [[New Zealand]]. [[Industrial Light & Magic]] created the visual effects sequences, which led to a revolutionary breakthrough with digital [[morphing]] technology. ''Willow'' was released in May 1988 to mixed reviews from critics, but was a modest financial success and received two [[Academy Award]] nominations.

==Plot==
The evil queen Bavmorda ([[Jean Marsh]]), a [[black magic|black sorceress]] who rules from her formidable stronghold of Nockmaar, is bent on conquering all lands around. She fears a prophecy stating that a newborn baby will eventually bring about her downfall; hence she imprisons all the pregnant mothers in her kingdom, and the child of the prophecy is born in her dungeons. But before Bavmorda has a chance to kill the infant via a nefarious ritual, the midwife escapes with the baby girl, and Bavmorda sends her daughter Sorsha ([[Joanne Whalley]]) and General Kael ([[Pat Roach]]), the commander of her army, after them. After a long pursuit, the Nockmaar hounds catch up with the midwife. Knowing she can't escape, she puts the baby on a raft and sends it downstream, trusting fate to run its course. The child washes up on shore near a village inhabited by a race of [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]-like people called Nelwyns, called "Pecks" derisively by humans, and is found by the children of Willow Ufgood ([[Warwick Davis]]), a farmer and amateur [[conjurer]] (though he has actual, if latent, magical talent). Willow is at first loath to take in the child, but eventually he comes to care for it.

The next day, however, a Nockmaar hound tracking the baby attacks the village. Once the cause of the attack is found, Willow is chosen by the town council to return the child to the world of the "large people," or Daikini (humans). The first Daikini Willow comes upon is a boasting warrior named Madmartigan ([[Val Kilmer]]), being held captive in an iron maiden by the side of the road for an unspecified crime, who offers to take care of the baby. During their interaction, they meet the retreating army of the kingdom of Galladoorn, which was recently destroyed by Bavmorda. Madmartigan asks his old friend Airk Thaughbaer, an officer in the army, to free him, but Airk contempuously refuses. On his way home, Willow is attacked by a clan of [[Brownie (folklore)|Brownie]]s, who stole the baby from Madmartigan. Willow is then told by the Brownie fairy queen of the forest, Cherlindrea, that the baby, Elora Danan, has chosen Willow to be her guardian. She gives Willow a magic wand and commissions him to find the sorceress Fin Raziel, with two of her brownies, Franjean and Rool, acting as his guides. Along the way, they bump into Madmartigan, who helps them escape from Sorsha.

Willow and the rest of the group finally meet Fin Raziel ([[Patricia Hayes]]), only to find that the sorceress has been turned into a rodent by Bavmorda. Soon afterwards Sorsha captures Willow and the others, and they start the long trek to Nockmaar castle. In a mountain camp, Willow attempts to use magic to turn Fin Raziel back into her human form, but transforms her into a [[raven]] instead. Franjean and Rool cause further mayhem when they accidentally expose Madmartigan to a fairy love dust they are carrying, which makes him become infatuated with Sorsha, but eventually they manage to escape, with Madmartigan proving his earlier boasts of being a fine swordsman.

The group eventually finds the castle of [[Tir Asleen]], which has been put under Bavmorda's spell; all its inhabitants are frozen in ice. Madmartigan, refusing to give up hope, prepares for Sorsha's attack while Willow once again fails transforming Raziel into human form, this time turning her into a goat. Sorsha, Kael and their army arrive and give battle. Willow also has to handle a few trolls, and after a botched magic spell, transforms one into a horrific two-headed dragon. Luckily, the remnants of the Army of Galladoorn, led by Madmartigan's friend Airk, ally with Willow. A battle ensues, and Sorsha finally discovers her love for Madmartigan. Kael, however, captures Elora and takes her to Nockmaar.

Willow, Madmartigan, Sorsha, the Brownies, the goat-sorceress Fin Raziel, and Airk's army set up camp, preparing to storm Nockmaar castle in a final attempt to rescue Elora. Bavmorda turns all the soldiers into pigs, but Raziel quickly teaches Willow how to protect himself from the spell. Willow finally returns Raziel to human form, and the sorceress is able to transform the soldiers back to their true forms as well. But since Nockmaar seems impenetrable, all despair until Willow proposes an ingenious trick which gets them inside the walls. Thus begins the battle of Nockmaar, in which Kael kills Airk and is in turn killed by Madmartigan, and Willow manages to save Elora at the last moment from Bavmorda's murderous ritual, whose victim the evil queen herself becomes, with one of his sleight-of-hand tricks. Willow leaves the baby in caring arms of Madmartigan and Sorsha and returns to his Nelwyn village and his beloved family with a special reward: a spellbook from Raziel, which helps him develop his own magical abilities.

==Production==
===Development===
[[George Lucas]] conceived the idea for ''Willow'' (originally titled ''[[Munchkin]]s'') in 1972. Lucas' desire for ''Willow'' was similar to ''[[Star Wars]]'', and created "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience".<ref name=little>{{cite book | author= Marcus Hearn | title = The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] | year =2005 | pages =153 | isbn = 0-8109-4968-7 | location = New York City}}</ref><ref name=funky/> During the production of ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' in 1982, Lucas approached [[Warwick Davis]], who was portraying [[List of Star Wars characters#W|Wicket]] the [[Ewok]], about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas "thought it would be great to use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea."<ref name=little/>

Lucas explained that he had to wait until the mid-1980s to make ''Willow'' because visual effects technology was finally advanced enough to execute his vision.<ref name=funky>{{cite news | author = Aljean Harmetz | title = 'Star Wars' Is 10, And Lucas Reflects | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1987-05-21 | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref> Meanwhile, actor-turned-director [[Ron Howard]] was looking to do a [[fantasy film]]. Howard was at [[Industrial Light & Magic]] during the [[post-production]] phase of ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'', when he was first approached by Lucas to direct ''Willow''. Howard had previously starred in Lucas' ''[[American Graffiti]]'',<ref>{{cite book | author= [[Ron Howard]] | title = The Cinema of George Lucas | publisher =[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]] | year =2005 | chapter = Forward | isbn = 0-8109-4968-7 | location = New York City}}</ref> and Lucas felt that he and Howard shared a simpatico relationship similar to the one Lucas enjoyed with [[Steven Spielberg]]. Howard nominated [[Bob Dolman]] to write the screenplay based on Lucas' story. Dolman worked with Howard on an unsold [[television pilot]] called ''Little Shots'', and Lucas admired Dolman's work on the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''.<ref name=Howard/>

Dolman joined Howard and Lucas at [[Skywalker Ranch]] for a series of lengthy story conferences, and wrote seven drafts of his script between the spring and fall of 1986.<ref name=Howard>Hearn, p.154-155</ref> [[Pre-production]] began in late-1986. Various [[major film studio]]s turned down the chance to distribute and co-finance ''Willow'' with [[Lucasfilm]] because they believed the fantasy genre was unsuccessful. This was largely due to films such as ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'', ''[[Legend (film)|Legend]]'', ''[[Dragonslayer]]'' and ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author = Aljean Harmetz | title = A Pained Lucas Ponders Attacks on 'Willow' | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1988-06-09 | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref> Lucas took ''Willow'' to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), which was headed by [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] Ladd and Lucas shared a relationship as far back as the mid-1970s, when Ladd, running [[20th Century Fox]], [[greenlight]]ed Lucas' idea for ''Star Wars''.<ref name=digital/> However, in 1986, MGM was facing financial troubles and its major investment of a fantasy film was perceived as a risk. Ladd advanced half the $36,000,000 budget for ''Willow'' in return for theatrical and television rights, leaving Lucasfilm with home video and [[pay television]] rights to offer in exchange for the other half.<ref name=digital/>

Lucas based the character of General Kael ([[Pat Roach]]) on the famous film critic [[Pauline Kael]].<ref name="The New York Times">{{cite news|url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E2D61639F937A3575AC0A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2|date = September 4, 2001|author = Lawrence Van Gelder|title = Pauline Kael, Provocative and Widely Imitated New Yorker Film Critic, Dies at 82|publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate = 2008-07-13}}</ref> On a similar route, the two-headed dragon was named "Eborsisk" after film critics [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]].<ref name="opie"/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on April 2, 1987 and ended that following October. Interior footage took place at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, while [[location shooting]] took place in Wales and New Zealand.<ref name=digital/> Lucas initially visualized shooting ''Willow'' similar to ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', with studio scenes at Elstree and locations in [[Northern California]], but the idea eventually faded. However, some exteriors were done around [[Skywalker Ranch]] and on location at [[Burney Falls]], near [[Mount Shasta]].<ref name=castle/> The Chinese government refused Lucas the chance for a brief location shoot. He then sent a group of photographers to South China to photograph specific scenery, which was then used for background [[chroma key|blue screen]] footage. [[Tongariro National Park]] in New Zealand was chosen to house Bavmorda's castle.<ref name=castle>{{cite book | author= John Baxter | title = Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas | pages = 365<U+2013>366 | publisher =[[Avon (publishers)|Avon]] | month = October | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-380-97833-4 | location = New York City}}</ref>

===Visual effects===
[[File:Willowraz.jpg|alt=A woman in a hooded cloak with her back to the camera holds a lightening wand toward a two-legged animal that appears to be part goat and part ostrich.|thumb|250px|Willow attempts to restore Fin Raziel into human form.]]
Lucas' [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) created the visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her original human form. Willow recites what he thinks is the appropriate spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, and then a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning Raziel to her human body. ILM supervisor [[Dennis Muren]] considered using [[stop motion]] animation for the scene.<ref>Baxter, p.367</ref> He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an [[optical printer|optical dissolve]] with [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]]s at various stages.<ref name=digital/>

Muren found both stop motion and optical effects to be too technically challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital [[morphing]] technology. Muren proposed filming each animal, and the actress [[body double|doubling]] for Patricia Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe (''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'').<ref name=digital/> The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen (''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'') achieved what would represent a breakthrough for [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI).<ref name=digital>Hearn, p.156-157</ref>

''Willow'' was released to mixed reviews from critics.<ref name=alien/> Based on 23 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', 43% of the critics enjoyed ''Willow'' with an average score of 5.4/10.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/willow/ | title = Willow | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] admitted he thought ''Willow'' was entertaining, but nonetheless gave a largely negative review.

[[Desson Thomson]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', explained "[[Rob Reiner]]'s similar fairytale adventure ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (which ''Willow'' [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]] also shot) managed to evoke volumes more without razzle-dazzle. It's a sad thing to be faulting Lucas, maker of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', for forgetting the tricks of entertainment."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Desson Thomson]] | title = Willow | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1988-05-20 | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref> Mike Clark in ''[[USA Today]]'' wrote that "the rainstorm wrap-up, in which Good edges Evil is like ''[[Led Zeppelin]] Meets [[The Wild Bunch]]''. ''Willow'' is probably too much for young children and possibly too much of the same for cynics. But any 6<U+2013>13-year-old who sees this may be bitten by the "movie bug" for life."<ref name=digital/>

===Awards===
[[Sound design]]ers [[Ben Burtt]] and Richard Hymns of [[Skywalker Sound]] were nominated the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]], but lost to ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. The visual effects supervisors also lost the [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] to ''Roger Rabbit'', which was similarly done by [[Industrial Light & Magic]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1230081785517 | title = Willow | work = [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref> [[Costume design]]er Barbara Lane won  the [[Saturn Award for Best Costume]] Design.

==Legacy==
The film was released on [[DVD]] as a "[[special edition]]" in November 2001 by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. The release included an [[audio commentary]] by [[Warwick Davis]] and two "making of" featurettes. In the commentary, Davis confirms that there were a number of "[[Deleted scene|lost scenes]]" previously rumored to have been deleted from the film including a battle in the valley, Willow battling a shark monster in a lake, and an extended sorceress duel at the climax.<ref>{{cite web | work = [[Amazon.com]] | url = http://www.amazon.com/Willow-Special-Val-Kilmer/dp/B00003CXDD | title = Willow (Special Edition) (1988) | accessdate = 2008-12-23}}</ref> (Though removed from the theatrical version, the battle with the lake monster was retained for both [[Marvel Comics]]' adaptation and [[Wayland Drew]]'s [[novelization]] of the film.){{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Novels===
Lucas outlined the ''Chronicles of the Shadow War'' trilogy to follow the film and hired comic book writer/novelist [[Chris Claremont]] to adapt them into a series of books. They take place about fifteen years after the original film and feature the now teenage Elora Danan as the central character.
