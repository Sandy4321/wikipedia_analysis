"'''Dead Celebrities'''" is the eighth episode of the [[South Park (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 189th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 7, 2009. In the episode, [[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]] is haunted by the ghosts of dead celebrities, and is eventually possessed by the spirit of [[Michael Jackson]].

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], and was rated [[TV-MA]] L in the United States. "Dead Celebrities" included references to several actors, singers and famous people who died in the summer of 2009, when ''South Park'' was on a mid-season hiatus. Among the celebrities featured in the episode were [[Billy Mays]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Patrick Swayze]], [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Natasha Richardson]], [[Bea Arthur]], and [[David Carradine]]. "Dead Celebrities" also parodied the films ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Poltergeist (film)|Poltergeist]]''.

The reality series ''[[Ghost Hunters]]'' and its stars, [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], were mocked in the episode. Hawes and Wilson said they loved the parody and encouraged fans to watch the show on their [[Twitter]] accounts. A subplot claimed food at the [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]] resulted in customers defecating blood, a claim which was disputed by the restaurant chain within days of the episode's broadcast. "Dead Celebrities" received generally mixed reviews. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], "Dead Celebrities" was seen by 2.67 million overall households.

==Plot==
[[List of South Park families#Ike Broflovski|Ike]] is terrified by frequent encounters with the ghosts of recently deceased celebrities. He is haunted by people such as [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[David Carradine]], [[Ed McMahon]], [[Adam Goldstein|Adam Goldstein (DJ AM)]], and especially [[Billy Mays]], who repeatedly tries selling Ike products from the afterlife. When [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] finds out about the ghost his brother is encountering, he is terrified. He tells [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] about the encounters and Cartman doesn't initially care, but suddenly changes his mind when Kyle mentions that one of the ghosts haunting Ike is Billy Mays. Cartman is an enthusiastic supporter of a product which Mays promoted, called "ChipotlAway", which cleans bloodstains from people's underwear caused by eating food from [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]], and therefore decides to help. The boys call the team from the reality television series ''[[Ghost Hunters]]'' in to help, but they quickly become frightened and run away after urinating themselves. Eventually, Ike goes into a [[coma]] because of his multiple experiences with the ghosts.

The boys seek help from a [[mediumship|medium]] (a parody of [[Zelda Rubinstein]]'s character in ''[[Poltergeist]]''), who explains the celebrities are trapped in [[purgatory]], which she compares to being stuck on a plane waiting endlessly on a runway for permission to take off. The ghosts of these annoyed celebrities are shown in this purgatory, which resembles the interior of an airplane, complete with seats, [[flight attendant]]s and pilot voice-over announcements. The medium manages to contact the spirits and [[Walter Cronkite]], another recently deceased person, tells her that they are trapped because [[Michael Jackson]] refuses to acknowledge [[Death of Michael Jackson|his death]]. The medium and the boys try to convince Jackson that he is dead, but Jackson insists he is not only alive, but also a little [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] [[girl]]. His denial is so strong that he emits a very powerful force which knocks the medium off her feet and through the open window of Ike's hospital room. She then falls to her death.

After the energy disturbance, Jackson's spirit takes over Ike's body, causing Ike to speak, sing and dance like Jackson himself. The boys find from online research that the only way to make Jackson accept his death is to make him experience the acceptance he sought in life, so they take him to a [[child beauty pageant]] for young girls. Dressed like a little girl, Ike/Jackson impresses two of the male judges by singing a tune sounding similar to Jackson's [[You Are Not Alone]], but they are promptly [[arrest]]ed for [[masturbation|masturbating]] while watching the children, leaving a single, unimpressed female judge. When Cartman notices the judge eating Chipotle, he bribes her with knowledge about the ChipotlAway product, and she declares Ike/Jackson the winner as a result. A few of the other contestants are physically beaten by their parents for losing. Having found his acceptance, Jackson leaves Ike's body, and Ike is extremely surprised and annoyed to find himself dressed like a little girl. Jackson and the other celebrities in purgatory are finally able to lift off. Initially happy, they are soon taken to [[Hell]]. To their annoyance, however, a flight attendant tells them that they must again wait as Hell is a [[gate (airport)|tow gate]].

==Cultural references==
"Dead Celebrities" makes frequent mention of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a [[Twitter]] message that the claim was false.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Walters |first=Chris |title=Chipotle Says Their Food Does Not Cause Underwear Blood |work=[[The Consumerist]] |date=October 9, 2009 |url=http://consumerist.com/2009/10/chipotle-says-their-food-does-not-cause-underwear-blood.html |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}</ref> In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like [[McDonald's]] or [[Taco Bell]].{{Citation needed| description where this episode commentary can be found is necessary|date=October 2010}} Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', which stars [[Haley Joel Osment]] as a young boy who can see ghosts.

 | quote  = "When I first learned of the premise of this episode, I was expecting some biting social commentary on our culture's obsession with celebrities and the hypocrisy of treating them like dirt when they're alive and practically worshiping them when they die. But the writers kept it simple, and just went for the laughs, and enough time had passed for the jokes to not seem ''too'' tasteless."

The episode received generally mixed reviews. Ramsley Isler of ''[[IGN]]'' called "Dead Celebrities" one of the best episodes of the season, adding the jokes at the expense of the deceased were not too tasteless. He praised the parodies of ''The Sixth Sense'', ''Poltergeist'' and ''Ghost Hunters'', but said some jokes, like the masturbating judges at the children's beauty contest, were offensive and unfunny.<ref name="IGN" /> [[Jason Hawes]] and [[Grant Wilson]], stars of ''[[Ghost Hunters]]'', declared that "far from being offended or incensed [...] they loved being made fun of alongside Michael Jackson and Billy Mays.<ref name=Popmatters/> Carlos Delgado of ''iF Magazine'' said "Dead Celebrities" was an especially funny episode that also featured a "crapload of story" that was well-timed for the [[Halloween]] season.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Delgado |first=Carlos |title=TV Review: South Park: Season 13 - "Dead Celebrities" - Fall Season Premiere |work=iF Magazine |date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> Josh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called it "a decent episode", but felt the dead celebrities were too obvious targets for ''South Park'' satire, adding, "It's easy to make the same jokes that the rest of the world already has." Modell said the ''Sixth Sense'' and ''Poltergeist'' references "fell a little flat", but he praised the Chipotle subplot, which he called "beautifully random [and] totally ridiculous".<ref name="AVClub" /> Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the episode was in bad taste, but added, "I laughed until I choked". Tucker described the Michael Jackson impersonation as "first-rate" and felt the solution to freeing Jackson's spirit served as "a ruthless parody of child beauty pageants".<ref name="EW" />

Ingela Ratledge of ''[[TV Guide]]'' favorably described the episode as the exact opposite of [[award show]] segments that reverentially pay homage to the year's departed celebrities, calling it "a wonderfully tasteless farewell."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ratledge |first=Ingela |title=Watercooler: R.I.P. ...And LOL! |work=[[TV Guide]] |date=October 19, 2009 |page=64}}</ref> Sue Bergerstein, an arts and celebrity writer with ''[[Examiner.com]]'', called "Dead Celebrities" a "new low" for ''South Park'', adding "It's not only tasteless but this episode just adds to the sadness currently experienced by all the mourning relatives."<ref name="Telegraph" /> ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Joshua Alston said few of the jokes in "Dead Celebrities" were funny, and so the mocking of celebrities "in the absence of laughs, felt tasteless and unnecessary".<ref>{{Cite news |last=Alston |first=Joshua |title=The 'South Park' Death Knell? |date=March 24, 2010 |work=[[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/235376 |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}</ref> Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', said many of the episodes seemed rehashed and predictable, especially those targeting Michael Jackson and children's beauty pageants.
