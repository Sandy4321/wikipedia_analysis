|Motto:

'''USS ''John Rodgers'' (DD-574)''' was a [[Fletcher class destroyer|''Fletcher''-class]] [[destroyer]] of the [[United States Navy]]. She was the second Navy ship of that name, in honor of three members of the [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)#Influence and legacy|Rodgers family]] who served in the Navy from the [[War of 1812]] through [[World War I]]. Later, ''John Rodgers'' served in the [[Mexican Navy]] ([[1968]]&ndash;[[2002]]) as '''BAM ''Cuitlahuac''''', becoming the last of the ''Fletcher'' class in active service.

''John Rodgers'' was laid down by [[Consolidated Steel Corp.]], [[Orange, Texas|Orange, Tex.]], [[25 July]] [[1941]]; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] [[7 May]] [[1942]], sponsored by Miss Helen Perry Rodgers, daughter, great grandniece, and great granddaughter of the ship's namesakes; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[9 February]] [[1943]], Commander H. O. Parrish in command.

== 1943 ==

After shakedown in the [[Caribbean]], ''John Rodgers'' departed [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] [[13 May]] escorting a [[convoy]] through the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Pearl Harbor]]. Following a short training period there, the destroyer joined the screen of a [[Aircraft carrier|fast carrier]] [[task force]] in August during damaging raids on [[Marcus Island]], [[Tarawa]], and [[Wake Island]] which also gathered invaluable information for future landings.

Then, in a joint [[cruiser]]-destroyer force, she sailed for [[Empress Augusta Bay]] to support landings on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] [[1 November]]. While screening the transports there a week later, she assisted [[USS Santa Fe (CL-60)|''Santa Fe'']] (CL-60) in splashing a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] [[torpedo plane]].

From this action she joined the destroyer screen of the Southern Attack Force for the invasion of the [[Gilbert Islands]]. She protected the transports during the [[Battle of Tarawa|landings on Betio Island]] [[20 November]] and remained in the area supporting the brave marines ashore until Tarawa Atoll was secure.

== 1944 ==

Late in December the destroyers sailed to Pearl Harbor to prepare for the next major offensive. ''John Rodgers'' departed Pearl Harbor [[22 January]] 1944 headed for the [[Marshall Islands]]. Profiting from experience gained in previous engagements, the Navy launched a well-coordinated [[Battle of Kwajalein|attack on Kwajalein Atoll]] [[31 January]]. In addition to providing antiaircraft and antisubmarine protection, ''John Rodgers'' supported the landing forces with gunfire which knocked out enemy troop concentrations and pill boxes. After the last resistance disappeared [[7 February]], the destroyer patrolled the Marshall Island area until late March.

During April she acted as escort for ships bringing men and weapons as American forces surprised the enemy at [[Hollandia]]. Naval fire support helped ground troops to secure airfields giving the United States a closer base for future attacks on the remaining Japanese-held islands.

In May ''John Rodgers'' operated out of [[Guadalcanal]] screening convoys and bombarding enemy positions. Early in June she sailed to the Marshall Islands to prepare for the [[Marianas Campaign]] and departed [[Eniwetok]] [[17 July]] with the [[Guam]] invasion force. Beginning [[21 July]], ''John Rodgers'' fired more than 3,600 rounds at targets on Guam helping to knock out enemy troop concentrations and defensive works. The destroyer remained in the [[Marianas]] until [[4 August]] and provided antisubmarine screen for transports bringing reinforcements.

In August ''John Rodgers'' began preparations for the Morotai Invasion and departed [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]] [[14 September]] to support and screen the landings there. After this operation, which provided the only Allied base from which to stage short-range fighters and bombers to [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]], she remained on patrol duty in the area.

''John Rodgers'' returned to Hollandia [[2 October]] to prepare for the long-awaited [[Philippines campaign, 1944-45|invasion of the Philippines]]. She got under way for Leyte [[13 October]] and arrived to [[Battle of Leyte|support landings]] 7 days later. Now commanded by Comdr. J. G. Franklin, she screened the ships carrying General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and his troops back to the Philippines. As American fighting men moved inland and took two important airfields, the destroyer provided fire support and patrolled the area.

Meanwhile, risking all to save the Philippines, Japan committed her entire remaining naval force to battle. The U.S. Navy met this challenge by routing the Japanese in the decisive [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and reducing their once powerful navy to a mere shadow of its former strength.

== 1945 ==

Following this historic action, ''John Rodgers'' departed the Philippines [[30 October]] for [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], [[California|Calif.]], and a badly needed overhaul. Rejuvenated by early January [[1945]], the destroyer sailed west to join Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]]'s [[Task Force 58]] (TF&nbsp;58) on [[7 February]] for final offensive operations against the enemy. Carrier strikes on the Japanese homeland began [[16 February]] and, in 2 days of relentless air attacks, destroyed nearly 800 enemy planes.

Then ''John Rodgers'' turned toward the [[Bonin Islands]] to screen a fast carrier task force covering the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|invasion of Iwo Jima]] [[19 February]]. Although air raids and heavy guns knocked out many enemy defensive works, the island was well enough fortified to make the Navy pay a high price in lives and weapons for this vital stopover for [[B-29]] bombers raiding [[Tokyo]].

Following [[Iwo Jima]], ''John Rodgers'' resumed duty with the fast carrier task force raiding Japan while awaiting the [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]], last and greatest amphibious operation of the Pacific war. ''John Rodgers'' operated with the carriers as they continued to bomb both Japan and [[Okinawa]]. She began screening operations as the first assault wave hit the beach [[1 April]]. She stood by protecting the carriers and splashed two [[kamikaze]]s as they dived toward the flattops. She remained in the area supporting operations until Okinawa was finally secure [[21 June]].

As the war closed, ''John Rodgers'' screened the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet|3d Fleet]] during almost continuous raids on Japan. Late in July she operated with Destroyer Division 25 (DesDiv&nbsp;25) on the [[Suruga Wan]] antishipping sweep and penetrated to within 1<U+00BD> miles of the Japanese shoreline, probably the closest approach made by surface ships during the entire war. Admiral [[William Halsey]] congratulated the division commander who had led the sweep on board ''John Rodgers'': "Loud applause to you and your boys for a well planned sweep conducted in the best destroyer tradition. You have been enrolled on the emperor's blacklist."

Following the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the subsequent [[Surrender of Japan|collapse of Japan]], the indefatigable destroyer screened transports carrying occupation troops into [[Tokyo Bay]] [[6 September]]. The triumphant entry into Tokyo was a fitting and well-deserved climax for ''John Rodgers'' who had fought in almost every major offensive campaign of the [[Pacific war]] without losing a single man.

Her stay was brief, however, as she sailed for home and arrived [[Boston Navy Yard|Boston, Mass.]] [[17 October]]. She moved to [[Charleston Naval Shipyard|Charleston, S.C.]], [[3 November]], decommissioned there [[25 May]] [[1946]], and entered the [[Atlantic Reserve Fleet]]. Moved to [[Philadelphia Navy Yard|Philadelphia, Pa.]] in [[1954]].

== BAM ''Cuitlahuac'' ==

The ship was transferred to [[Mexico]] [[1 May]] [[1968]]. She served in the [[Mexican Navy]] as '''BAM ''Cuitlahuac''''', named after [[Cuitl<U+00E1>huac]] (?&ndash;1520), the second-to-last [[Aztec]] emperor of the Mexica.

''Cuitlahuac'' was retired by the Mexican Navy [[16 July]] [[2002]]&mdash;bringing to an end the 60-year history of the ''Fletcher''-class ships.

The ''Cuitlahuac'' was transferred to the ownership of U.S.-based nonprofit Beauchamp Tower Corporation on December 7, 2005. It will be moved back to the United States in 2006 and restored, with it ultimately becoming a World War II Pacific Theater Museum.

You can follow the events that are bringing the Rogers home to the States over at the blog, The Castle of Argghhh, [http://www.thedonovan.com/archives/cat_dd_574_uss_john_rodgersbam_cuitlahuac.html].  John the Armorer is blogging the trip.  Beauchamp Tower Corporation is also posting pictures and information about the ship and it's return to the United States, at its corporate Weblog, Operation Enduring Service [http://www.btcorp.us/mt].

== Awards ==
''John Rodgers'' received 12 [[battle star]]s for [[World War II]] service.
