The '''Japanese whiting''', ''Sillago  japonica'', (also known as the '''Japanese sillago''' or '''Shiro-gisu''') is a common species of [[coastal]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fish]] belonging to the smelt-whiting family, [[Sillaginidae]]. As suggested by its name, the Japanese whiting was first recorded from [[Japan]] in 1843, but has subsequently been found to extend to [[Korea]], [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. 

The species inhabits a variety of shallow water habitats where it preys on a variety of [[crustacean]]s as well as [[polychaete]]s, [[bivalve]]s and small fish. They [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] between June and October, and are taken in large quantities during this period by [[fishermen]]. Being one of the most abundant species of fish around Japan, they make up a large percentage of the commercial catch.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The Japanese whiting is one of 29 [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Sillago]]'', which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting [[family (biology)|family]] [[Sillaginidae]]. The smelt-whitings are [[Perciformes]] in the [[suborder]] [[Percoidea]].<ref>{{ITIS | ID = 646047 | taxon = Sillago japonica | year = 2007 | date = 05 September}}</ref>

The species was first recognized and [[ICZN|scientifically described]] by Temminck and Schlegel in 1843 based on a [[holotype]] taken somewhere along the Japanese coast. The species has often been mistaken for ''[[Sillago sihama]]'', and erroneously been published under this name by a number of [[author]]s, the first being Steindachner and D<U+00F6>derlein in 1885. Studies into various aspects of the Japanese whiting's [[biology]] have also been incorrectly named as studies on ''S. sihama''.<ref name = "Fishbase">{{FishBase species | genus = Sillago | species = japonica | year = 2007 | month = Aug }} </ref>

The [[binomial name|binomial]] and [[common name]] of the species refers to the [[country]] where the species was first described from; [[Japan]], although its range has subsequently found to be much wider than just Japan. The species is locally known as Shiro-gisu in Japan and Chin-Sa-Suo in [[China]].<ref name = "McKay1985">{{cite journal |last=McKay |first=R.J. |year=1985 |title=A Revision of the Fishes of the Family Silaginidae |journal=Memoirs of the Queensland Museum |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>73 |doi=}}</ref>

==Description==
As with most of the genus ''Sillago'', the Japanese whiting has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth.<ref name = "Fishbase"/> The body is covered in small [[ctenoid]] [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] extending to the two rows of [[cheek]] scales and head. The first [[dorsal fin]] has 11 [[Fish anatomy#Spines_and_Rays|spines]] and the second dorsal fin has 1 leading spine with 21 to 23 soft rays posterior. The [[anal fin]] is similar to the second dorsal fin, but has 2 spines with 22 to 24 soft rays posterior to the spines. Other distinguishing features include 70 to 73 [[lateral line]] scales and a total of 35 [[vertebrae]]. The species has a known maximum length of over 30 cm.<ref name = "McKayFAO" > {{cite book | last = McKay | first = R.J. | coauthors = | title = FAO Species Catalogue: Vol. 14.

Like all species of sillaginid, the [[swim bladder]] is the most dependable diagnostic feature. Japanese whiting have a swim bladder characterised by a single, long [[posterior]] extension which tapers to a slender point. The [[anterior]] end of the organ has three long median projections, with the central extension the longest.<ref name = "McKay1985"/> 

The [[colour]] of the fish is a greenish grey above with the dorsal region of the [[head]] darker and whitish on the underside of the fish. The anterior and posterior dorsal fins are [[hyaline]], with the first few membranes of the spinous dorsal fin dusted in tiny brown spots. The anal, [[ventral fin|ventral]] and [[pectoral fin]]s are also hyaline, with the pectoral having a greenish upper margin and base. The [[caudal fin]] is whitish with dark margins.<ref name = "McKay1985"/>

''S. japonica'' occurs in a variety of [[habitat]]s, with shallow [[sand]]y flats in [[bay]]s, [[surf]] zones of beaches, protected [[eelgrass]] seabeds and occasionally [[estuaries]] used by the species. They are a shallow water species, operating in [[depth]]s between 0 and 30 m. Juveniles tend to use eelgrass beds as a nursery area, gaining both food and protection from these habitats while adults move to more exposed areas.<ref name = "gunners">{{cite journal | last = Kwak | first = Seok Nam | coauthors = Gun Wook Baeck and Sung-Hoi Huh | title = Feeding ecology of ''Sillago japonica'' in an Eelgrass (''Zostera marina'')  bed | journal =  Journal of Fisheries Science and Technology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 84<U+2013>89 | date = 2004 | accessdate =  }}</ref>

==Biology==
Like other sillaginids, the Japanese whiting is [[benthic]] in nature, inhabiting the bottom layer of water in a [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] system. This is due to the benthic nature of their prey during the daytime, which inhabit these layers of weaker water flow preferentially due to their body shape.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kazunori | first = Arayama | coauthors = Kono Hiroshi | title = Vertical Distributions of the Japanese Whiting, ''Sillago japonica'', Larvae and Juveniles and their Food Organisms at a Sandy Beach in Tateyama Bay, Central Japan | journal = Suisan Zoshoku | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 167<U+2013>170 | date = 2004 | id = ISSN 0371-4217 | accessdate =  }}</ref>  Japanese whiting are a [[swarm|schooling]] species like most other sillaginids, and similarly are able to burrow into the sand to escape [[predator]]s or forage for [[prey]].<ref name = "McKayFAO" />

===Diet===
Studies of Japanese whiting occupying surf zones show that there is a distinct shift in [[diet]] as fish [[mature]], with the change occurring at a length of around 20 mm. Young fish tended to consume a higher proportion of [[calanoid]] [[copepod]]s, with small amounts of [[mysid]]s also taken.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Inoue | first = Takashi | coauthors = Yusuke Suda and Mitsuhiko Sano | title = Food habits of fishes in the surf zone of a sandy beach at Sanrimatsubara, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan | journal = Ichthyological Research | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 9<U+2013>14 | date = 2005 | doi = 10.1007/s10228-004-0246-2 | id = ISSN 1341-8998 | accessdate =  }}</ref> Older fish take substantially more mysids, with few copepods or [[polychaetes]] taken. Other studies have found [[amphipod]]s, [[bivalve]]s, [[caridea]]n [[shrimp]]s, [[crab]]s and small [[fish]] also contribute to the diets of ''S. japonica'' in some areas, helping to reduce [[interspecific competition]] locally.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Kwak | first = Seok Nam | coauthors = Sung-Hoi Huhb & David W.

[[Season]]al changes associated with prey abundance are also observed.<ref name = "gunners"/>

===Reproduction===
Japanese whiting produce between 13,600 to 68,900 [[Egg (biology)#Fish eggs|egg]] in a [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] period, which occurs between June and October.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Sulition | first = O. | coauthors = S.

==Relationship to humans==
Being one of the most common [[inshore]] species in Japan, it has become one of the most important  [[commerce|commercial]] species in the country, greatly esteemed for its delicate flavour.<ref name = "McKayFAO" /> [[Angling|Recreational fishermen]] in Japan also take the species often, especially in summer, with the species relatively easy to access from land based fishing areas.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kanoyama Japanese Restaurant | title = Fish Facts | url = http://kanoyama.com/fishfacts.php | accessdate = 2007-09-07  }}</ref> Many studies have been carried out on the breeding of the species in captivity, which has led to the development of an [[aquaculture]] market for Japanese whiting.<ref name = "McKayFAO" />

In other countries where other sillaginids are more prevalent, Japanese whiting are caught as a [[byproduct]] of smaller inshore fisheries, usually alongside other species of ''Sillago''.
