'''Louis-Philippe I, King of the French''' ([[October 6]], [[1773]] &ndash; [[August 26]], [[1850]]) was [[List of French monarchs|King of the French]] from 1830 to 1848 in what was known as the [[July Monarchy]]. He was the last [[king]] to rule [[France]], but his title was '''King of the French''', not '''King of France'''.

==Before the Revolution (1773<U+2013>1789)==

===Early Life===

Louis-Philippe was born at the [[Palais Royal]] in [[Paris]] to [[Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Louis Philippe Joseph, duc de Chartres]] (later [[Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|duc d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] and also known as "''Philippe <U+00C9>galit<U+00E9>''") and [[Louise Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de de Bourbon-Penthi<U+00E8>vre]]. As a member of the reigning [[House of Bourbon]], he was a [[Prince du Sang]]. He was the first of three sons and a daughter of the Orl<U+00E9>ans family, a family that was to have erratic fortunes for the next court years. 

The relationship between the [[House of Orleans|Bourbon-Orl<U+00E9>ans junior line]], to which he belonged, and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon elder line]], to which the king belonged, was linked through [[Louis XIII]]. The elder line had a deep distrust of the intentions of the family which would succeed to the French throne should the senior Bourbons die out. Exiled from the royal court, the Orl<U+00E9>ans confined themselves to studies of the literature and sciences emerging from the [[French Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

===Education===

Louis-Philippe was tutored by the [[St<U+00E9>phanie F<U+00E9>licit<U+00E9> Ducrest de St-Albin, comtesse de Genlis|Comtesse de Genlis]], beginning in 1782. Madame de Genlis instilled in him a fondness for [[liberal]] thought; it is probably during this period that Louis-Philippe picked up his slightly [[Voltaire|Voltairean]] brand of [[Catholicism]]. When Louis-Philippe's grandfather died in 1785, his father succeeded him as Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans, and Louis-Philippe succeeded his father as Duke of Chartres.

In 1788, with the [[French revolution|Revolution]] looming, the young Louis-Philippe showed his liberal sympathies when he helped break down the door of a prison cell in [[Mont Saint-Michel]], during a visit there with Madame de Genlis. From October 1788 to October 1789 the ''[[Palais-Royal]]'', the [[Paris]] home of the Orl<U+00E9>ans family, was a meeting-place for the revolutionaries.

==Revolution (1789<U+2013>1793)==

During the early stages of the Revolution, Louis-Philippe strongly supported the reformation of French society as a whole. However, his father Philippe's actions during the vote on the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] changed the fortunes of the young Duke of Chartres and his family. As Philippe continued his support for the liberal factions of the Revolution, the royal family and the royal court became increasingly hostile towards the Orl<U+00E9>ans family. Dubbed "''Philippe <U+00C9>galit<U+00E9>''", he became an exemplar of liberal reform to the common people of Paris. 

Hundreds of medallions with Philippe's figure framed by the title '''P<U+00E8>re du Peuple''' (Father of the People) were minted and seen in the streets. But Philippe's actual position was weak, which became apparent as he was involved in several scandals in Paris. In October 1789, he went to [[England]] on the pretext of negotiating with the [[British government]] to set up an independent kingdom in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. He returned in July 1790. [[Honor<U+00E9> Mirabeau]] later said of him: "if we need some sort of a puppet it might as well be that bastard as anyone else."

===Military Service===

Louis-Philippe grew up in a period that changed [[Europe]] as a whole, and he involved himself completely in those changes (a trait of his which would remain when he became King). In his diary, he reports that he himself took the initiative to join the [[Jacobin Club]], a move that his father supported. In June 1791, Louis-Philippe got his first opportunity to become involved in the affairs of France. In 1785, he had been given the hereditary appointment of [[Colonel]] of the 14th [[Regiment]] of [[Dragoons]] (''Chartres-Dragons''). 

With war on the horizon in 1791, all proprietary colonels were ordered to join their regiments. Louis-Philippe showed himself to be a model officer, and he demonstrated his personal bravery in two famous instances. First, three days after Louis XVI's [[flight to Varennes]], a quarrel between two local priests and one of the new "constitutional" vicars became heated, and a crowd surrounded the inn where the priests were staying, demanding blood. The young Colonel broke through the crowd and extricated the two priests, who then fled. At a river crossing on the same day, another crowd threatened to harm the priests. Louis-Philippe put himself between a peasant armed with a [[carbine]] and the priests, saving their lives. The next day, Louis-Philippe dived into a river to save a drowning local engineer. For this action, he received a "[[civic crown]]" from the local municipality. His regiment was moved north to [[Flanders]] at the end of 1791 after the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]].

Louis-Philippe served under his father's crony, the Duke of Biron, along with several officers who later gained distinction in [[Napoleon]]'s empire and afterwards. These included Colonel [[Louis Alexandre Berthier|Berthier]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais|Alexandre de Beauharnais]] (husband of the future [[Jos<U+00E9>phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos<U+00E9>phine]]). Louis-Philippe saw the first exchanges of fire of the Revolutionary Wars at [[Boussu]] and Quaragnon and a few days later fought at [[Qui<U+00E9>vrain]] near [[Jemappes]], where he was instrumental in rallying a unit of retreating soldiers. Biron wrote to War Minister [[Pierre Marie de Grave|de Grave]], praising the young colonel, who was then promoted to [[brigadier]], commanding a brigade of cavalry in L<U+00FC>ckner's Army of the North.
{{House of Orleans}}<!--LEAVE IT HERE, OR MOVE DOWNWARDS IF POSSIBLE (CHECK CONFLICTS WITH OTHER IMAGES). DON'T USE PLEASE THE TABLE FORMAT, IT CREATES VERY UNPLEASANT TRUNKED LINES!!!!-->
In the Army of the North, Louis-Philippe served with four future Marshals of France: [[<U+00C9>tienne-Jacques-Joseph-Alexandre MacDonald|Macdonald]], [[<U+00C9>douard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|Mortier]] (who would later be killed in an [[assassination]] attempt on Louis-Philippe), [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]], and [[Nicolas Oudinot|Oudinot]]. [[Charles Fran<U+00E7>ois Dumouriez|Dumouriez]] was appointed to command the Army of the North in August 1792. Louis-Philippe commanded a division under him in the [[Battle of Valmy|Valmy]] campaign.

At Valmy, Louis-Philippe was ordered to place a battery of artillery on the crest of the hill of Valmy. The battle of Valmy was inconclusive, but the [[Austria]]n-[[Prussia]]n army, short of supplies, was forced back across the [[Rhine]] river. Once again, Louis-Philippe was praised in a letter by Dumouriez after the battle. Louis-Philippe was then recalled to Paris to give an account of the Battle at Valmy to the French government. There he had a rather trying interview with [[Georges Danton|Danton]], Minister of Justice, which he later fondly re-told to his children. 

While in Paris, he was promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant-general]]. In October he returned to the Army of the North, where Dumouriez had begun a march into [[Belgium]]. Louis-Philippe again commanded a division. Dumouriez chose to attack an [[Austria]]n force in a strong position on the heights of Cuesmes and [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] to the west of [[Mons]]. Louis-Philippe's division sustained heavy casualties as it attacked through a wood, retreating in disorder. Louis-Philippe rallied a group of units, dubbing them "the battalion of Mons" and pushed forward along with other French units, finally overwhelming the outnumbered Austrians.

Events in Paris undermined the budding military career of Louis-Philippe. The incompetence of [[Jean-Nicolas Pache]], the new [[Girondist]] appointee, left the Army of the North almost without supplies. Soon thousands of troops were deserting the army. Louis-Philippe was alienated by the more radical policies of the [[French Republic|Republic]], and he began to think of leaving France after the vote to execute [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], in which his father voted 'yes'. Dumouriez and Louis-Philippe met on [[22 March]] [[1793]] where Dumouriez urged his subordinate to join in his attempt to ally with the Austrians, march his army on Paris, and restore the Constitution of 1791. 

Louis-Philippe was willing to stay in France to fulfill his duties in the army. But he was implicated in Dumouriez's plot, and with the French government slowly falling into the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], he decided to leave France to save his life. On [[April 4]] Dumouriez and Louis-Philippe left for the Austrian camp. They were intercepted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Louis Nicolas Davout]], who had served at [[Battle of Jemappes|Jemappes]] with Louis-Philippe. As Dumouriez ordered the Colonel back to the camp, some of his soldiers cried out against the General, now declared a [[treason|traitor]] by the [[National Convention]]. Shots rang out as they fled towards the Austrian camp. The next day, Dumouriez again tried to rally soldiers against the Convention; however, he found that the artillery had declared for the Republic, leaving him and Louis-Philippe with no choice but to go into [[exile]]. At the age of 19, Louis-Philippe left France; it was some 21 years before he again set foot on French soil.

==Exile (1793<U+2013>1815)==

The reaction in [[Paris]] to Louis-Philippe's involvement in Dumouriez's treason inevitably resulted in misfortunes for the Orl<U+00E9>ans family. Philippe spoke in the [[National Convention]], condemning his son for his actions, asserting that he would not spare his son, much akin to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] judge [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and his sons. However, letters from Louis-Philippe to his father were discovered in transit and were read out to the [[National Convention|Convention]]. Philippe was then put under continuous surveillance. Shortly thereafter, the [[Girondists]] moved to arrest Philippe and the two younger brothers of Louis-Philippe, [[Louis-Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis-Charles]] and [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine Philippe]]; the latter had been serving in Biron's Army of the North. The three were interned in [[Fort Saint-Jean (Marseille)|Fort Saint-Jean]].

While this was occurring, Louis-Philippe was forced to live in the shadows, avoiding both pro-Republican revolutionaries and [[Legitimist]] French ''[[Wiktionary:emigre|emigr<U+00E9>]]'' centers in various parts of Europe and also in the Austrian army. He first moved to [[Switzerland]] under an assumed name, and met up with Madame de Genlis and his sister [[Louise Marie Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de Eug<U+00E9>nie d'Orl<U+00E9>ans|Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de]] at [[Schaffhausen]]. From there they went to [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], where the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] authorities decreed that to protect Swiss [[Neutral country|neutrality]], Louis-Philippe would have to leave the city. They went to [[Zug]], where Louis-Philippe was discovered by a group of ''emigr<U+00E9>s''. 

It became quite apparent that for the ladies to settle peacefully anywhere, they would have to separate from Louis-Philippe. He then left with his faithful valet Baudouin for the heights of the [[Alps]], and then to [[Basel]], where he sold all but one of his horses. Now moving from town to town throughout Switzerland, he and Baudouin were found themselves very much exposed to all the distresses of extended travelling. They were refused entry to a [[monastery]] by monks who believed them to be young vagabonds. Another time, he woke up after spending a night in a barn to find himself at the far end of a [[musket]], confronted by a man attempting to keep away thieves. 

Throughout this period, he never stayed in one place more than 48 hours. Finally, in October 1793, Louis-Philippe was appointed a teacher of [[geography]], [[history]], [[mathematics]], and modern languages at a boys' boarding school. The school, owned by a Monsieur Jost, was in Reichenau, a village on the upper Rhine, across from Switzerland. His salary was 1,400 francs and he taught under the name "M. Chabos". He had been at the school for a month when he heard the news from Paris: his father was [[guillotine]]d on [[6 November]] [[1793]] after a sham trial before the Revolutionary Tribunal. 

===Travels===

In early 1794, Louis-Philippe began courting Marianne Banzori, the cook of M. Jost, the Reichenau schoolmaster. After Louis-Philippe ended his academic career in late 1794, M. Jost discovered that Marianne was [[pregnant]]. Upset with Louis-Philippe, Jost sent Marianne to [[Milan]] where the child was born in December 1794, and then placed in an orphanage.

After Louis-Philippe left Reichenau, he separated the now 16-year old Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de from Madame de Genlis, who had fallen out with Louis-Philippe (now Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans after the death of his father). Ad<U+00E9>la<U+00EF>de went to live with her great-aunt the Princess of Conti at Fribourg, then to [[Bavaria]] and finally to [[Hungary]]. Later she went to her mother in [[Spain]].

Louis-Philippe travelled extensively. He visited [[Scandinavia]] in 1795. For about a year, he stayed in [[Muonio]] (Torne Valley), a remote town at the northern end of the [[Gulf of Bothnia]], living in the [[rectory]] under the name M<U+00FC>ller as a guest of the local [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] priest. Here he met the priest's wife's sister, Beata Caisa Wahlbom, who was a housekeeper in the rectory. Not long after Louis-Philippe left [[Scandinavia]], Beata Caisa Wahlbom gave birth to a son, whom she named Erik.

Louis-Philippe also visited the [[United States]] for four years, staying in [[Philadelphia]] (where his brothers [[Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine Philippe]] and [[Louis-Charles, Count of Beaujolais|Louis-Charles]] were in exile), [[New York City]], and [[Boston]]. In Boston, he taught [[French language|French]] for a time and lived in lodgings over what is now the [[Union Oyster House]], Boston's oldest restaurant. During his time in the United States, Louis-Philippe met with American politicians and people of high society, including [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], [[John Jay]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], and [[George Washington]]. 

His visit to [[Cape Cod]] in 1797 coincided with the division of the town of Eastham into two towns, one of which took the name of Orleans, possibly in his honour. During their sojourn, the Orl<U+00E9>ans princes travelled throughout the country, visiting as far south as [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and as far north as [[Maine]]. The brothers were even held in Philadelphia briefly during an outbreak of [[yellow fever]]. He is also thought to have met [[Isaac Snow]] of [[Orleans, Massachusetts]], who escaped to France from a British prison hulk during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1839, while reflecting on his visit to the United States, Louis-Philippe explained in a letter to [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Guizot|Guizot]] that his three years there had a large influence on his later political beliefs and judgements when he became king.

In Boston, Louis-Philippe learned of the [[coup of 18 Fructidor]] ([[September 4]], [[1797]]) and the exile of his mother to Spain. He and his brothers then decided to return to Europe. They went to [[New Orleans]], planning to sail to [[Havana]] and thence to Spain. This however was a troubled journey, as Spain and [[Great Britain]] were then at war.

They sailed for [[Havana]] in an American corvette, but the ship was stopped in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by a British warship. The British seized the three brothers, but took them to Havana anyway. Unable to find passage to Europe, the three brothers spent a year in Cuba, until they were unexpectedly expelled by the Spanish authorities. They sailed via [[the Bahamas]] to [[Nova Scotia]]. There they were received by the [[Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent|Duke of Kent]], son of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and later father of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. Louis-Philippe struck up a lasting friendship with the British royal. Eventually, the brothers sailed back to New York, and in January 1800, they arrived in England, where they stayed for the next 15 years.

===Marriage===

In 1809 Louis-Philippe married Princess [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies|Marie Amalie of Bourbon-Sicilies]], daughter of King [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|Ferdinand I]] of the [[Two Sicilies]] and [[Marie Caroline of Austria]].

They had the following ten children:

# [[Prince Ferdinand-Philippe of France|Ferdinand-Philippe]], [[Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|duc d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]] (b. [[3 September]] [[1810]]<U+2013>d. 1842) married Helena of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
# [[Louise-Marie of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Louise-Marie]] (b. [[3 April]] [[1812]]<U+2013>d. 1850) married [[Leopold I of Belgium]]. Children included [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] and [[Charlotte of Belgium|Carlota of Mexico]].
# [[Marie of Orl<U+00E9>ans (1813-1839)|Marie]] (b. [[12 April]] [[1813]]<U+2013>d. 1839) married Duke Alexander of W<U+00FC>rttemberg (b. 1804<U+2013>d. 1881).
# [[Louis Charles Philippe Raphael, duc de Nemours|Louis Charles Philippe Raphael]] (b. [[25 October]] [[1814]]<U+2013>d. 1896) married [[Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Kohary]] (b. 1822<U+2013>d. 1857).

# [[Fran<U+00E7>ois d'Orl<U+00E9>ans, prince de Joinville|Fran<U+00E7>ois]] (b. [[14 August]] [[1818]]<U+2013>d. 1900) married [[Princess Francisca of Brazil|Francisca of Brazil]] (b. 1824<U+2013>d. 1898), daughter of [[Pedro I of Brazil]].
# Charles, Duke of Penthi<U+00E8>vre (b. [[1 January]] [[1820]]<U+2013>d. 1828)
# [[Henri d'Orleans|Henri]], Duke of Aumale (b. [[16 June]] [[1822]]<U+2013>d. 1897) married Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (b. 1822<U+2013>d. 1869).
# [[Antoine, Duke of Montpensier|Antoine]] (b. [[31 July]] [[1824]]<U+2013>d. 1890), married [[Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier|Luisa Fernanda of Spain]] (b. 1832<U+2013>d. 1897) daughter of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and became a prince of Spain.

==Bourbon Restoration (1815<U+2013>1830)==
[[Image:Louis Philippe Silver Coin.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Silver five-franc coin featuring Louis Philippe from 1834. The French inscription is ''LOUIS PHILIPPE I ROI DES FRAN<U+00C7>AIS'', in English, "Louis Philippe I, King of the French."]]
{{main|Bourbon Restoration}}

After the [[abdication]] of Napoleon, Louis-Philippe returned to France during the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|restoration]] of the monarchy under his cousin King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. Louis-Philippe had reconciled the Orl<U+00E9>ans family with Louis XVIII in exile, and was once more to be found in the elaborate royal court. However, his resentment at the treatment of his family, the junior branch of the [[House of Bourbon]] under the ''[[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime]]'', caused friction between him and Louis XVIII. He openly sided with the liberal opposition.

Louis-Philippe was on far friendlier terms with [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], who succeeded Louis in 1824. Louis-Philippe dined and socialised often with him. However, his opposition to the policies of [[Vill<U+00E8>le]] and later [[Jules de Polignac]] caused him to be a constant threat to the stability of Charles's government.

==King of the French (1830<U+2013>1848) ==
{{main|July Monarchy}}

In 1830, the [[July Revolution]] overthrew Charles X. Charles abdicated in favor of his 10-year-old grandson, the [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Duc de Bordeaux]].  Louis-Philippe was charged by Charles X to announce to the popularly elected [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chambre des D<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>s]] his desire to have his grandson succeed him . Louis-Philippe did not do this in order to increase his own chances of succession. As a consequence, because the chamber was aware of Louis-Philippe's Republican policies and his popularity with the masses, they proclaimed Louis-Philippe, who for 11 days had been acting as the [[regent]] for his small cousin, as the new French king. In displacing the senior line of the [[House of Bourbon]], Louis-Philippe succeeded where his father, Philippe <U+00C9>galit<U+00E9>, had failed.  

In anger over what they regarded as his betrayal, Charles X and his family, including his grandson, left for [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]]. The grandson, better known as the [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Comte de Chambord]], later became the [[Pretender|pretender]] to Louis-Philippe's throne and was supported by many nobles known as [[Legitimist]]s. 
[[Image:Louis-Philippe coa.png|thumb|left|240px|Arms of Louis-Philippe.]]
In direct opposition to the absolutist tendencies of his Bourbon predecessors, Louis-Philippe took the [[Style - Manner of Address|style]] of '''King of the French''', a constitutional innovation known as [[popular monarchy]] which linked the monarch's title to a ''people'', not to a ''state'', as the previous designation '''King of France''' did. In doing so, the new king sought to undercut the claims of Charles X and his family by repudiating the [[Legitimist]] theory of the [[divine right of kings]]. 

By his ordinance of [[August 13]], [[1830]], soon after his accession to the throne, it was decided that the king's sister and his children would continue to bear the arms of Orl<U+00E9>ans, that Louis-Philippe's eldest son, as '''[[Prince Royal]]''', would bear the title '''[[Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Duc d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]]''', that the younger sons would continue to have their existing titles, and that the sister and daughters of the king would only be styled '''Princesses d'Orl<U+00E9>ans''', not "of France".

In 1832, his daughter, Princess [[Louise-Marie of France|Louise-Marie]] (1812<U+2013>1850), married the first ruler of [[Belgium]], King [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]]. Interestingly, Leopold I's official title was '''King of the Belgians''' and not, '''King of Belgium'''. Thus, Louis-Philippe's daughter, Princess Louise-Marie, held the very similar title of '''Queen of the Belgians''', just as her father was '''King of the French'''.

In July 1835 Louis-Philippe survived an assassination attempt by [[Giuseppe Mario Fieschi]] on the [[boulevard du Temple]] in Paris.

Louis-Phillippe ruled in an unpretentious fashion, avoiding the pomp and lavish spending of his predecessors. Despite this outward appearance of simplicity, his support came from the wealthy middle classes. At first, he was much loved and called the "Citizen King" and the "[[bourgeois]] monarch," but his popularity suffered as his government was perceived as increasingly [[conservative]] and monarchical. Under his management the conditions of the working classes deteriorated, and the [[income gap]] widened considerably. An economic crisis in 1847 led to the citizens of France revolting against their king again the following year.

== Abdication and death (1848<U+2013>1850) ==

[[Image:Caricature Charles Philipon pear.jpg|thumb|The famous 1831 caricature of Louis-Philippe turning into a pear would mirror the deterioration of his popularity. (Honor<U+00E9> Daumier, after Charles Philipon who was jailed for the original.)]]
On [[February 24]], [[1848]], during the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|February 1848 Revolution]], to general surprise, King Louis-Philippe abdicated in favor of his nine-year-old grandson, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe]]. (His son and heir, [[Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Prince Ferdinand]], had died in an accident in 1842.) Fearful of what had happened to [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Louis-Philippe quickly disguised himself and fled Paris. Riding in an ordinary cab under the name of "Mr. Smith", he escaped to [[England]]. According to ''[[The Times]]'' of [[March 6]], [[1848]], the King and Queen were received at [[Newhaven, East Sussex]] before travelling by train to London.

The [[National Assembly]] initially planned to accept young Philippe as king. The strong current of public opinion rejected that. On [[February 26]], the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] was proclaimed. Prince Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected President in December; a few years later he declared himself [[president for life]] and then Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]].

Louis-Philippe and his family lived in England until his death in [[Claremont (country house)|Claremont]], [[Surrey]]. He is buried with his wife, Amelia ([[April 26]], [[1782]]<U+2013>[[March 24]], [[1866]]), at the [[Royal Chapel of Dreux|Chapelle Royale]], the family necropolis he had built in 1816, in [[Dreux]].

== The clash of the pretenders ==
The clashes of 1830 and 1848 between the [[Legitimists]] and the [[Orleanist]]s over who was the rightful monarch were resumed in the 1870s. After the fall of the Second Empire, a monarchist-dominated National Assembly offered a throne to the Legitimist pretender, "Henry V," the [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Count of Chambord]]. As he was childless, his heir was (except to the most extreme Legitimists) Louis-Phillippe's grandson, the [[Philippe, Comte de Paris|Count of Paris]]. So Chambord's death would unite the House of Bourbon and House of Orl<U+00E9>ans.

However, Chambord refused to take the throne unless the [[Flag of France|Tricolor]] flag of the revolution was replaced with the [[fleur-de-lis]] flag of the ''ancien r<U+00E9>gime''. This the National Assembly was unwilling to do. A [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established, though many intended for it to be temporary, to be abolished and replaced by a constitutional monarchy when Chambord died. However, Chambord lived longer than expected. By the time of his death in 1883, support for the monarchy had declined, and public opinion sided with a continuation of the Third Republic, as the form of government that "divides us least," in [[Adolphe Thiers]]' words. Some suggested a monarchical restoration under a later comte de Paris after the fall of the [[Vichy regime]], even though the royalists had supported Vichy, but this did not occur.

Most French monarchists regard the descendants of Louis Philippe's grandson, who hold the title "Count of Paris" as the rightful [[pretender]]s to the French throne. A small minority of Legitimists prefer Don [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Luis-Alfonso de Borbon, Duke of Anjou]] (to his supporters, "Louis XX"). He is descended in the male line from [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe, Duke of Anjou]], the second grandson of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], who renounced his right to the throne of France on becoming King of [[Spain]].

The two sides challenged each other in the French Republic's law courts in 1897 and again nearly a century later. In the latter case, [[Henri, Comte de Paris, Duc de France|Henri]], Count of Paris, challenged the right of the Spanish-born "pretender" to use the French royal title ''Duke of Anjou''. The French courts threw out his claim, arguing that the legal system had no jurisdiction over the matter.
