'''Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer''' (May 21, 1960&nbsp;<U+2013> November 28, 1994) was an American [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]]. Dahmer murdered 17 men and boys{{ndash}}many of whom were of [[African]] or [[Asian people|Asian]] descent{{ndash}}between 1978 and 1991, with the majority of the murders occurring between 1987 and 1991. His murders were particularly gruesome, involving [[rape]], [[torture]], [[dismemberment]], [[necrophilia]] and [[cannibalism]]. On November 28, 1994, he was beaten to death by an inmate at the [[Columbia Correctional Institution]], where he had been incarcerated.

== Early life ==

Dahmer was born in [[West Allis, Wisconsin]], the son of Joyce Annette (n<U+00E9>e Flint) and Lionel Herbert Dahmer, an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]].<ref name="beaconj">{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=JEFFREY DAHMER|pages=|publisher=Beacon Journal|date=1994-11-29|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AK&s_site=ohio&p_multi=AK&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB63121D18F8CA5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> Seven years later, his brother David was born.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} Joyce Dahmer reportedly had a difficult [[pregnancy]] with her elder son. When he was eight years old, he moved with his family to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath, Ohio]]. Dahmer's early childhood was normal, but he grew increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative between the ages of 10 and 15, showing little interest in any hobbies or social interactions.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=76<U+2013>79}} He biked around his neighborhood looking for dead animals, which he dissected at home, going so far as to put a dog's head on a stake.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer began drinking in his teens and was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] by the time of his high-school graduation.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=82}}

In 1977, Lionel and Joyce Dahmer divorced.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=90}} Dahmer attended [[Ohio State University]], but dropped out after one quarter, having failed to attend most of his classes.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=103<U+2013>104}} He was drunk for the majority of the term.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=105}} Dahmer's father then forced him to enlist in the [[United States Army|Army]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=107}} Dahmer did well at first,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=108<U+2013>109}} but he was discharged after two years because of his alcoholism.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=110<U+2013>111}} When the Army discharged Dahmer in 1981, it provided him with a plane ticket to anywhere in the country. Dahmer told police he could not go home to face his father, so he headed to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], because he was "tired of the cold".<ref name="adamWalsh" /> He spent most of his time there at a hospital, but was kicked out shortly after for drinking.<ref name="adamWalsh" /> After coming home he continued to drink heavily, and he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct later in 1981.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}}

In 1982, Dahmer moved in with his grandmother in West Allis,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}} where he lived for six years.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}} During this time, his behavior grew increasingly strange. His grandmother once found a fully dressed male mannequin in his closet; Dahmer had stolen it from a store.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119<U+2013>120}} On another occasion, she found a [[.357 Magnum]] under his bed.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=122<U+2013>123}} Terrible smells came from the basement; Dahmer told his father that he had brought home a dead [[squirrel]] and dissolved it with chemicals.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=124<U+2013>126}} He was arrested twice for [[indecent exposure]], in 1982 and 1986;{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=131}} in his second offense, he [[masturbation|masturbated]] in front of two boys.<ref name="Bardsley-7" /> 

In summer 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out because of his late nights, his strange behavior, and the foul smells from the basement. He then found an apartment on [[Milwaukee]]'s West side, closer to his job at the Ambrosia Chocolate Factory.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=132}} On September 26, 1988, one day after moving into his apartment, he was arrested for drugging and [[Child sexual abuse|sexually fondling]] a 13-year-old boy in Milwaukee named Somsack Sinthasomphone.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=133<U+2013>135}} He was sentenced to five years [[probation]] and one year in a [[work release]] camp. He was required to register as a [[sex offense|sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}} Dahmer was [[parole]]d from the work release camp two months early, and he soon moved into a new apartment.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143<U+2013>144}} Shortly thereafter, he began a string of murders that ended with his arrest in 1991. During this era, Dahmer was also active in Milwaukee-area [[gay rights]] and [[BDSM]] communities.<ref>Anti-pornography activist [[Judith Reisman]], Ph.D., wrote, "This author 'met' Jeffrey Dahmer in July 1991, just before he was arrested. Dahmer, naked except for his sadomasochistic leather straps, chains and crotch gear, jumped off a parade float manned by his sadism colleagues in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin gay rights parade to greet a group of us onlookers..." Reisman, Judith A. (2002) "Crafting Bi/Homosexual Youth." Regent University Law Review, Volume 14, Number 2, Spring 2002, p. 329.</ref>

== Murders ==

Jeffrey Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978. While still living in his father's house, and with his family away, Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks. He offered to drink beer with him back at his father's house and planned to have sex with him. Dahmer bludgeoned Hicks to death with a barbell, later saying he had committed the crime because "the guy wanted to leave and I didn't want him to."<ref name="PurcellArrigo2006">{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Catherine E.|coauthors=A. Arrigo, Bruce|title=The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide|publisher=Academic Press|date=2006|page=77|chapter=5|isbn=012370510X|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=agmkfIgbQxUC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=Jeffery+Dahmer%2Bhicks&source=bl&ots=ymRSt4IgrO&sig=Ii6-iUCiSsMv8xSyTk3xhNY2Jg8&hl=en&ei=_yI5SoOuLo7qsQPc6aX-Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4}}</ref> Dahmer buried the body in the backyard.<ref>Roy, Jody M. ''Love to Hate'' NY: Columbia Univ. Press, 2002; pp. 102 ''et seq.''</ref> Nine years passed until Dahmer claimed his next victim, Steven Tuomi.<ref name="Bardsley-7" /> After the Tuomi murder, Dahmer continued to kill sporadically; two more murders in 1988, and another in early 1989, usually picking up his victims in [[gay bar]]s and having sex with them before killing them.<ref>Roy, Jody M. ''Love to Hate'' NY: Columbia Univ. Press, 2002; pp. 103 ''et seq.''</ref> He kept the skull of his 1989 victim, Anthony Sears, until he was caught.<ref name="Bardsley-8" />

In May 1990, he moved out of his grandmother's house for the last time and into the apartment that later became infamous: Apartment 213, 924 North 25th Street, Milwaukee. Dahmer picked up the pace of his killing: four more murders before the end of 1990, two more in February and April 1991, and another in May 1991.<ref name="Bardsley-10" />

In the early morning hours of May 27, 1991, 14-year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone (by coincidence, the younger brother of the boy whom Dahmer had molested) was discovered on the street, wandering naked, heavily under the influence of drugs and bleeding from his [[rectum]]. Two young women from the neighborhood found the dazed boy and called [[911]]. Dahmer chased his victim down and tried to take him away, but the women stopped him.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=7}} Dahmer told police that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, and that they had an argument while drinking. Against the protests of the two women who had called 911, police turned him over to Dahmer. They later reported smelling a strange scent while inside Dahmer's apartment, but did not investigate it. The smell was the body of Tony Hughes, Dahmer's previous victim, decomposing in the bedroom. The two policemen did not make any attempt to verify Sinthasomphone's age and failed to run a background check that would have revealed Dahmer was a convicted [[child molestation|child molester]] still under probation.<ref name="Bardsley-3" /> Later that night, Dahmer killed and dismembered Sinthasomphone, keeping his skull as a souvenir.

By summer 1991, Dahmer was murdering approximately one person each week. He killed Matt Turner on June 30, Jeremiah Weinberger on July 5, Oliver Lacy on July 12, and finally Joseph Brandehoft on July 19. Dahmer got the idea that he could create "[[zombie]]s" of his victims, and attempted to do so by drilling holes into their skulls and injecting [[hydrochloric acid]] or boiling water into the frontal lobe area of their brains with a large syringe.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} Other residents of the Oxford Apartments complex noticed terrible smells coming from Apartment 213, as well as the thumps of falling objects and the occasional buzzing of a power saw.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html "The Little Flat of Horrors", ''TIME Magazine'', 5 August 1991]</ref>

== Arrest ==

On July 22, 1991, Dahmer lured another man, Tracy Edwards, into his home. According to the would-be victim, Dahmer struggled with Edwards in order to handcuff him, but ultimately failed to cuff his wrists together.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} Wielding a large butcher knife, Dahmer forced Edwards into the bedroom, where Edwards saw pictures of mangled bodies on the wall and noticed the terrible smell coming from a large blue barrel.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=152}} Edwards punched him in the face, kicked him in the stomach, ran for the door and escaped.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153<U+2013>154}} Running through the streets, with the handcuffs still hanging from one hand, Edwards waved for help to a police car driven by Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller of the Milwaukee police department.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} Edwards led police back to Dahmer's apartment, where Dahmer at first acted friendly to the officers. However, Edwards remembered that the knife Dahmer had threatened him with was in the bedroom. When one of the officers checked the bedroom, he saw the photographs of mangled bodies, and called for his partner to arrest Dahmer.<ref name="Bardsley-4" /> As one officer subdued Dahmer, the other opened the refrigerator and found a human head. Further searching of the apartment revealed three more severed heads, multiple photographs of murdered victims and human remains, severed hands and penises, and photographs of dismembered victims and human remains in his refrigerator.<ref name="Bardsley-5" />

The story of Dahmer's arrest and the inventory in his apartment quickly gained notoriety: several corpses were stored in acid-filled vats, and implements for the construction of an [[altar]] of candles and human skulls were found in his closet. Accusations soon surfaced that Dahmer had practiced necrophilia and cannibalism. Seven skulls were found in the apartment.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=157}} A human heart was found in the freezer.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=158}}

== Trial ==

[[File:JeffreyDahmer-StonePhillips.jpg|thumb|Jeffrey Dahmer during an interview for ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' with [[Stone Phillips]].]]

Jeffrey Dahmer was [[indictment|indicted]] on 17 murder charges, later reduced to 15. Dahmer was not charged in the [[attempted murder]] of Edwards.{{Citation needed}} His trial began on January 30, 1992.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=207}} With evidence overwhelmingly against him, Dahmer pleaded [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=209<U+2013>210}} The trial lasted two weeks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} The court found Dahmer sane and guilty on 15 counts of murder and sentenced him to 15 [[life term]]s,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975527,00.html "Guilty!"], ''TIME Magazine, 18 May 1992</ref> totaling 957 years in prison.<ref name="Bardsley-21" /> At his sentencing hearing, Dahmer expressed remorse for his actions, and said that he wished for his own death. In May of that year, Dahmer was [[extradition|extradited]] to Ohio, where he entered a plea of guilty for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=241}}

== Imprisonment and death ==

Dahmer served his time at the [[Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin]], where he ultimately declared himself a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]. This conversion occurred after viewing [[Evangelism|evangelical]] material sent to him by his father.<ref>[http://www.drdino.com/read-article.php?id=127 "'Creation Science' Makes a Difference."] CSE Ministry. October 18, 2007.</ref> A local preacher from the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Roy Ratcliff]], met with Dahmer and agreed to [[baptism|baptize]] him.<ref name="Bardsley-22" />

Dahmer was attacked twice in prison, the first time in July 1994. After attending a church service in the prison chapel, an inmate attempted to slash Dahmer's throat with a razor blade. Dahmer escaped the incident with superficial wounds.<ref>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/390410/ Wisconsin Inmate help in Slaying of Dahmer."] ''Deseret News''. November 29, 1994.</ref> While on work detail in the prison gym, Dahmer and another inmate, [[Jesse Anderson]], were severely beaten by fellow inmate [[Christopher Scarver]] with a bar from a weight machine on November 28, 1994. Dahmer died of severe head [[Physical trauma|trauma]] while on his way to the hospital in an ambulance.  Anderson died two days later from his wounds.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2606,00.html "Dahmer Killer Charged"], ''TIME Magazine'', 15 December 1994</ref> Dahmer's [[brain]] was retained for study.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4207/is_19950317/ai_n10189382/?tag=content;col1 "Dahmer's brain kept for research."] Associated Press. ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]],'' Mar 17, 1995. Archived version.</ref>

== Aftermath ==

Upon learning of his death, Dahmer's mother, Joyce Flint, responded angrily to the media, "Now is everybody happy? Now that he's bludgeoned to death, is that good enough for everyone?" The response of the families of Dahmer's victims were mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death. The District Attorney who prosecuted Dahmer cautioned against turning Scarver into a folk hero, noting that Dahmer's death was still murder.<ref name="peoplemag1994">{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20104660,00.html|title=The Final Victim|last=Gleick|first=Elizabeth|date=December 12, 1994|work=Vol. 42 No. 24|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>

After the murders, the Oxford Apartments at 924 North 25th Street were demolished; the site is now a vacant lot. Plans to convert the site into a memorial garden failed to materialize.

In 1994, Lionel Dahmer published a book, ''A Father's Story'', and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims and their families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel Dahmer and his wife, Shari. He has retired from his career as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] and resides with his wife in [[Medina County, Ohio]]. Lionel Dahmer is an advocate for [[creationism]], and his wife was a member of the board of the Medina County Ohio Horseman's Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/bios/ |title=Some modern scientists who have accepted the biblical account of creation |work=Answers in Genesis}}</ref> Both continue to carry the name Dahmer and say they love Jeffrey despite his crimes. Lionel Dahmer's first wife, Joyce (Flint), died of [[cancer]] in 2000 at the age of 64. She was later buried in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Dahmer's younger brother David changed his last name and lives in anonymity.

Dahmer's estate was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages. In 1996, Thomas Jacobson, a lawyer representing eight of the families, announced a planned auction of Dahmer's estate to raise up to $1 million, sparking controversy.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/US/9605/08/dahmer.auction/index.html Serial killer's property set to go on the auction block."] ''CNN.com''.

May 20, 1996.</ref> A civic group, Milwaukee Civic Pride, was quickly established in an effort to raise the funds to purchase and destroy Dahmer's possessions. The group pledged $407,225, including a $100,000 gift by Milwaukee real estate developer Joseph Zilber, for purchase of Dahmer's estate; five of the eight families represented by Jacobson agreed to the terms, and Dahmer's possessions were destroyed.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EEDF1E39F93AA15756C0A960958260 "Auction of Dahmer Items Is Apparently Off."] ''The New York Times''.

In January 2007, evidence surfaced potentially linking Dahmer to [[Murder of Adam Walsh|Adam Walsh's 1981 abduction and murder]] in Florida.<ref name="adamWalsh">
