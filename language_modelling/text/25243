The {{nihongo|'''posting system'''|<U+30DD><U+30B9><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+5236><U+5EA6>|posutingu seido}} is a [[baseball]] player transfer system in effect between [[Japan]]'s [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) and the [[United States]]' [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). NPB players have never been subject to the [[Major League Baseball Draft|Rule 4 Draft]], which MLB teams traditionally use to acquire amateur players. Because no formal rules were in place to govern the process, problems arose when NPB players began playing in MLB. NPB teams lost star players without compensation, an effect highlighted in the late 1990s when NPB stars [[Hideo Nomo]] and [[Alfonso Soriano]] left to play in MLB after using loopholes to void their existing contracts. Additionally, NPB players had very little negotiating power if their teams decided to deal them to MLB, as seen when pitcher [[Hideki Irabu]] was dealt to a MLB team despite stating he did not want to be traded. The posting system was created to address both problems. 

When a NPB player is posted, MLB holds a four-day-long [[silent auction]]. During this auction, MLB teams can submit sealed bids in an attempt to win the exclusive rights to negotiate with the player for 30&nbsp;days. If the MLB team with the winning bid and the NPB player agree on contract terms before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the bid amount as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play in MLB. If the MLB team cannot come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team.

As of 2009, thirteen Japanese players have been posted using the system. Of these, seven signed Major League contracts immediately, three signed [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] contracts, and two were unsuccessful in drawing any MLB interest. The two highest-profile players that have been acquired through the posting system are [[Ichiro Suzuki]] and [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Respectively, they attracted high bids of $13.125&nbsp;million and $51.1&nbsp;million and have enjoyed successful careers in MLB.

==History==
The first instance of a Nippon Professional Baseball player playing in Major League Baseball occurred in 1964 when the [[Nankai Hawks]], an NPB team, sent three exchange prospects to the US in order to gain experience in MLB's [[Minor league baseball|minor league system]]. While playing for the [[San Francisco Giants]]' Class-A team, the [[Fresno Giants]], one of the players, [[pitcher]] [[Masanori Murakami]], was named [[California League]] Rookie of the Year. Giants' executives were impressed with the talent Murakami exhibited in the minor leagues, and on September 1, 1964, Murakami was promoted and became the first Japanese player to play in MLB. After Murikami put up good [[Baseball statistics#pitching statistics|pitching statistics]] as a [[relief pitcher|reliever]], Giants' executives decided to exercise a clause in their contract with the Hawks that allowed them to sign one of the three NPB exchange prospects to a contract. NPB officials objected, however, and told the Giants that Murakami was merely on loan for the [[1964 Major League Baseball season|1964 season]]. An agreement was reached, and the Giants agreed to send Murakami back to Japan after the [[1965 Major League Baseball season|1965 season]]. After pitching strongly the following season for the Giants, Murakami was sent back to Japan to play for the Hawks.<ref name="murakami">{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20031024064230/http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/news/mlb_news_story.jsp?article_id=sf_20011220_murakami_news&team_id=sf |title=Where have you gone, Masanori Murakami? |accessdate=Novermber 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |date=December 24, 2001 |author=Kleinberg, Alexander}}</ref> This affair led to a 1967 "working agreement" between MLB and NPB, which was basically a hands-off policy.<ref name="mlb"/>

The posting system was created as a combined reaction to three specific cases involving NPB players moving to MLB in the late 1990s. The first incident occurred in the winter of 1994 when pitcher [[Hideo Nomo]], who was not eligible for [[free agent|free agency]], announced his retirement from the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]]. This retirement enabled Nomo to void his contract with the Buffaloes and sign with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in February 1995, where he won the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award.<ref name="time">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020715-300682-2,00.html |title=The Ichiro Paradox |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author=Price, S.L. |date=July 8, 2002}}</ref> The following year, the Dodgers signed Nomo to a 3-year, $4.3 million contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E6DA1039F930A15751C0A960958260 |title=Sports People: Baseball;Dodgers Sign Nomo To Three-Year Deal |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 23, 1996}}</ref>

Two years later, in late 1997, the [[San Diego Padres]] signed a working agreement with the [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] that gave the Padres the exclusive signing rights for [[Hideki Irabu]]. Neither team consulted with Irabu before finalizing the deal, and he and his agent soon stated that Irabu would only sign with the [[New York Yankees]]. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] (MLBPA) sided with Irabu stating that the system gave the player no freedom. The MLBPA soon lost the argument, and MLB's executive council ruled that the Padres held the rights to Irabu. Irabu ultimately won, however, when the Padres quickly traded him to the Yankees who signed him for $12.8&nbsp;million over four years.<ref name="irabu">{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/12/05/sports/base.php |title=Baseball: Irabu's legacy is a high-stakes auction |accessdate=April 9, 2008 |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] |author=Sandomir, Richard |date=December 5, 2006}}</ref>
[[Image:Alfonso Soriano.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfonso Soriano]]'s move to MLB helped prompt the creation of the posting system.]]
The final incident occurred the next year when [[Alfonso Soriano]] was unable to leave the [[Hiroshima Toyo Carp]] due to contract restrictions. Soriano disliked the intense Japanese practice schedule, and the Carp denied him a salary increase from $45,000 to $180,000 per year. Taking the advice of agent [[Don Nomura]], the same agent who represented Hideo Nomo during his retirement from NPB, Soriano also retired in order to void his contract with the Carp and pursue a career in MLB.<ref name="sori">{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1026510/index.htm |title=He's Arrived |author=[[Jeff Pearlman|Pearlman, Jeff]] |accessdate=Novermber 21, 2008 |date=August 26, 2002 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> This decision resulted in the Carp management suing Nomura for $100,000 in damages as well as threatening legal action against any MLB ball club that negotiated with Soriano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2002/07/07/2002-07-07_star_wars_alfonso_soriano_is.html |title=Alfonso Soriano is second to none, but it took a fight against an entire country |author=McCarron, Anthony |accessdate=November 21, 2008 |date=July 7, 2002 |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]}}</ref> On July 13, 1998, however, [[Commissioner of Baseball|MLB Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] declared that MLB recognized him a free agent, and the Carp backed down. Soriano signed a 5-year, $3.1&nbsp;million contract with the New York Yankees the same year. The contractual clause in NPB contracts that allowed both Nomo and Soriano free agency by retiring has been since been removed.<ref name="sori"/>

The posting system was drafted that same year; Bud Selig and [[NPB Commissioner]] Hiromori Kawashima signed the deal in December 1998.<ref name="irabu"/> In its design, each of the problems brought up by the Nomo, Irabu and Soriano cases were addressed. The system forces MLB teams to place bids for NPB players that eventually act as transfer fees. These fees are compensation for NPB teams who let their star players out of contracts and run the risk of losing fans.<ref name="time"/> NPB players are also allowed to negotiate with MLB teams when dictating the terms of their new contracts.

The system only applies to players currently under contract with a Japanese team; it does not apply to free agents, players who have ten or more years of playing service with NPB or amateur players who have never played in NPB.<ref name="deep">{{cite web |url=http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060911&content_id=1657081&vkey=news_tex&fext=.jsp&c_id=tex |title=Going Deep: Going interactive |accessdate=April 14, 2008 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |date=September 11, 2006 |author=Newberg, James}}</ref> Currently, [[Mac Suzuki]] and [[Kazuhito Tadano]] and are the only Japanese players to have played in MLB without playing in NPB.<ref name="tazawa espn">{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3583152 |title=Amateur Tazawa bypassing Japan leagues for MLB |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |date=September 12, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |author=Allen, Jim}}</ref> In late 2008, amateur Japanese pitcher [[Junichi Tazawa]], who was not drafted into NPB, began to draw the interest of MLB teams.<ref name="tazawa nyt">{{cite web| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/sports/baseball/20pitcher.html?_r=3&scp=1&sq=Tazawa&st=cse&oref=slogin |title=Japanese Are Irked by U.S. Interest in Pitcher |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |author=[[Alan Schwarz|Schwarz, Alan]]}}</ref> As of January 2009, Tazawa announced his intention to bypass NPB and the posting system in order to sign directly with an MLB team.<ref name="tazawa espn"/> The system does not work in reverse, as it does not regulate MLB players, such as [[Alex Cabrera]], who move to NPB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2001/0703/1221823.html |title=No Ichiro-type tale for Arias |date=July 3, 2001 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]] |accessdate=November 20, 2008 |author=[[Jim Caple|Caple, Jim]]}}</ref>

==Process==
When a player under contract with a Nippon Professional Baseball team wishes to play in Major League Baseball, he must notify his current team's management and request that they make him available for posting during the next posting period (November 1&ndash;March 1).<ref name="mlb">{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061114&content_id=1740635&vkey=news_bos&fext=.jsp&c_id=bos |title=Matsuzaka posting system's latest gem |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |accessdate=August 24, 2008 |date=November 14, 2006 |author=Singer, Tom}}</ref>  If the team consents, the player is presented to the [[Baseball Commissioner|MLB Commissioner]]. The Commissioner then notifies all MLB teams of the posted player and holds a four-day-long [[silent auction]] during which interested MLB teams submit sealed bids in U.S. dollars ([[United States dollar|USD]]) to the Commissioner<U+2019>s Office. After the allotted four days have passed, the Commissioner closes the bidding process and notifies the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the bidding team is.<ref name="rockerbie">{{cite web |url=http://mopupduty.com///mnt/w0400/d33/s19/b0289d90/www/mopupduty.com///wp-content/uploads/2008/01/japanesepostingrules.pdf |title=Peculiarities of the Major League Baseball Posting System |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |author=Rockerbie, Duane W. |publisher=[[University of Lethbridge]] |format=PDF |date=July 2007}}</ref> The NPB team then has four days to either accept or reject the nonnegotiable bid amount.<ref name="mlb"/>

If the bid is rejected, the NPB team retains the player<U+2019>s rights. If accepted, however, the bid amount is publicly revealed and the winning Major League team is granted the exclusive rights to negotiate with the player for 30&nbsp;days.<ref name="deep"/> If the player and the MLB team agree on contract terms before the 30-day period has expired, the NPB team receives the bid amount as a transfer fee, and the player is free to play for that team in MLB in the coming season. The transfer fee is not included when calculating a MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a [[luxury tax]] when it exceeds $155&nbsp;million.<ref name="rockerbie"/><ref name="tax">{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081222&content_id=3726222&vkey=news_nyy&fext=.jsp&c_id=nyy&partnerId=rss_nyy |title=Yankees, Tigers hit with luxury tax |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |publisher=[[Major League Baseball]] |date=December 22, 2008 |author=Singer, Tom}}</ref> If the MLB team cannot come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee is paid, and the player's rights revert to his NPB team. A player can request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process is repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the previous year.<ref name="rockerbie"/>

==Controversy and criticism==
[[Image:WBC2006 Daisuke Matsuzaka.jpg|thumb|The posting system was criticized after the [[Boston Red Sox]] paid a total of $103.1&nbsp;million to sign pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]].]]
The system received criticism from MLB insiders and US sports writers after the 2006&ndash;07 posting period. Before the posting of the period's first player, [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]], in early November 2006, it was believed that he would draw bids as high as $30&nbsp;million&mdash;more than twice the bid amount that [[Ichiro Suzuki]] garnered.<ref name="kurkjian">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=kurkjian_tim&id=2697354&lpos=spotlight&lid=tab3pos2 |title=Posting process needs to be altered |author=[[Tim Kurkjian|Kurkjian, Tim]] |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |work=[[ESPN The Magazine]] |date=December 16, 2006}}</ref> Shocking both American and Japanese baseball executives, Matsuzaka received a high bid of $51.1&nbsp;million.<ref name="Sloan">{{cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSSP15866320070201 |title=Japan player posting system needs review, say Yankees |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |author= Sloan, Dan |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=February 1, 2007}}</ref> The Boston Red Sox's winning bid was more than $11&nbsp;million higher than the second largest bid.<ref name="kurkjian"/>

When the negotiations between Matsuzaka and the Red Sox had reached a stalemate as the negotiation period neared its close, ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Dave Sheinin questioned both parties' intentions. Sheinin believed that the Red Sox could have foreseen the contractual stalemate and submitted a high bid simply to deny the [[New York Yankees]] an opportunity to negotiate with Matsuzaka. On the other hand, after Matsuzaka's agent, [[Scott Boras]], threatened to take Matsuzaka back to NPB if his price was not met, Sheinin theorized that Boras intentionally wanted to hinder contract negotiations.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/12/AR2006121201349_pf.html |title=Red Sox' Talks With Matsuzaka at Endpoint |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |author=Sheinin, Dave |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 13, 2006}}</ref> ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'''s [[Tim Kurkjian]] described the situation as "the most obvious [[chicken (game)|game of chicken]] ever."<ref name="kurkjian"/> Sheinin suggested that, if the negotiations were to fail, Boras could take legal action. He could allege that by requiring MLB teams to pay large transfer fees to NPB teams, the posting system artificially depresses a player's compensation. Boras did not believe that the transfer fee should affect a player's compensation.<ref name="Washington Post"/>

The Boston Red Sox eventually signed Matsuzaka, however; Including the transfer fee and contract, the team paid approximately $103.1&nbsp;million in total to acquire the pitcher. Kurkjian believes that with fees and contracts this high, small-market teams cannot afford to compete with large-market teams for the rights to negotiate with some posted Japanese players. Kurkjian blames the posting system's employment of a blind bidding system as the cause of Matsuzaka's "outrageous offer."<ref name="kurkjian"/> He also postulates that Matsuzaka's high bid amount helped to inflate the bids for [[Kei Igawa]] who was posted two weeks later, perpetuating the problem further.<ref name="kurkjian"/> After winning the negotiation rights to Igawa, Yankees' [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Brian Cashman]] told reporters that "the posting system, clearly with what took place this winter, might not necessarily be the best system". Kurkjian claims that other MLB executives already believe that a traditional [[free agent]] structure where the highest bidder wins would be better than the current system.<ref name="kurkjian"/> MLB's vice president for Asia said that a review of the posting system would be conducted in conjunction with the NPB.<ref name="Sloan"/>
