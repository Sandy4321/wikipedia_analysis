'''''The Bedford Incident''''' is a [[Cold War]] [[film]] from [[1965]] starring [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Sidney Poitier]], and co-produced by [[Richard Widmark]]. The cast also features [[Martin Balsam]] and [[Eric Portman]], as well as an early appearance by [[Donald Sutherland]].  The film was based on the 1963 book by Mark Rascovich, which was patterned after [[Herman Melville|Herman Melville's]] ''[[Moby Dick]]''. 

The screenplay was written by James Poe. It was directed by [[James B. Harris]], who up to that point was best known as [[Stanley Kubrick|Stanley Kubrick's]] producer. Harris had recently split from a nine-year partnership with Kubrick. Just after the split, Kubrick would make ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1963), which raises similar issues to ''The Bedford Incident''.

==Plot synopsis==

The American destroyer USS ''Bedford'' detects a [[Soviet]] [[submarine]] in the North Atlantic near [[Greenland]].  Captain Eric Finlander (Widmark) harries his prey mercilessly, while civilian reporter Ben Munceford (Poitier) and [[NATO]] naval advisor, Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke (Portman), look on with mounting alarm. The film also features [[Wally Cox]] as a sonarman and  [[James MacArthur]] as Ensign Ralston, a young officer who is constantly pressured by his captain over small errors caused by his inexperience.

Munceford is treated with mounting hostility by the captain because he is seen as a civilian putting his nose where it does not belong and because he disagrees with Finlander's decision to continue with an unnecessary and dangerous confrontation.

The crew becomes increasingly fatigued by the unrelenting pursuit of the submarine. Finally, Ralston mishears a command and launches a missile that sinks the quarry, but not before it fires  [[torpedo]]es. Despite Munceford's desperate pleas, Finlander makes no attempt to save his doomed ship, because Finlander knows the enemy torpedoes contain nuclear warheads.

==Production==
''The Bedford Incident'' was mostly filmed at [[Columbia Pictures]] studios in [[England]], although some shots at sea were used, including a vessel portraying a Russian intelligence ship (with English, and not Cyrillic lettering along the side), and a Royal Navy frigate ([[HMS Wakeful (R59)|HMS ''Wakeful'']]) portraying the ''Bedford'' in one scene. 

The USS ''Bedford'' (DLG-113) is a fictitious [[guided missile destroyer]]. No ship of the [[United States Navy]] has been named ''Bedford'', or had the [[hull classification symbol]] DLG-113, but the role of ''Bedford'' was played by a [[Farragut class destroyer]].
