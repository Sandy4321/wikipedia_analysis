The boat was discovered by an [[Australian Customs and Border Protection Service]] surveillance plane {{convert|109|nmi|km}} south of Java at about 3:00 pm [[Time in Australia|AWST]].<ref name="SMH">{{cite news|first=Glenda|last=Kwek|coauthor=Coorey, Phillip| title=Dozens feared dead as packed asylum boat capsizes off Christmas Island|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/dozens-feared-dead-as-packed-asylum-boat-capsizes-off-christmas-island-20120622-20rnz.html#ixzz1yTCJ1d4H|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012}}</ref>  The boat had sent out a distress call on 19 June, but it failed to identify its location.  On 20 June, the boat sent out a second distress call, at which point Australian authorities advised the boat to return to Indonesia.  The boat was spotted later that day by a surveillance plane as it continued toward Australian waters.  "No visual signs of distress" were observed by the plane's crew.<ref name=AP />  Australian authorities then began to prepare to respond when the boat would enter their territory, but it capsized before leaving Indonesian waters.<ref name=AP />

About 40 survivors were found clinging to the upturned boat, while others were found on floating debris up to four miles (6 km) from the disaster's location.<ref name=AP />  Survivors and bodies of the deceased were transported to Christmas Island aboard the patrol boat {{HMAS|Wollongong|ACPB 92|6}}.<ref name="SMH"/>  Rescue efforts are being coordinated by Indonesian authorities with assistance from Australia.<ref name="Age001">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/disaster-at-sea-dozens-feared-dead-20120621-20r3f.html|title=Disaster at sea: dozens feared dead|work=The Age|date=22 June 2012|accessdate=22 June 2012|author=Grattan, Michelle; Gordon, Michael}}</ref>  Eight Australian and Indonesian ships, plus five Australian aircraft, were still searching for additional survivors on 22 June.<ref name=AP />  Australian Home Affairs Minister [[Jason Clare]] stated that the prospect of finding additional survivors was "increasingly grim", due to rough seas.<ref name=AP />

Human traffickers often disable their boats once they have entered Australian waters and send out distress calls to have their "cargo" picked up.<ref name=AP />  Christmas Island is a popular target for asylum seekers, whose journeys sometimes end in tragedy.  In a statement, the U.N. refugee agency said the tragedy "reinforces the need for renewed international solidarity and cooperation to find protection options for people".<ref name=AP/>
