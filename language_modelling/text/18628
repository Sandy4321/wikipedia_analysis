Initially known as '''{{mp|2005 FY|9}}''' (and later given the [[minor planet names|minor planet number]] 136472), it was discovered on [[March 31]], [[2005]] by a team led by [[Michael E.

On [[June 11]], [[2008]], the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] included Makemake in its list of potential candidates to be given "[[plutoid]]" status, a term for dwarf planets beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]] that would place the object alongside Pluto and {{dp|Eris}}.

==Discovery==
Makemake was discovered on [[March 31]], [[2005]] by a team led by [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]],<ref name=jpldata>{{cite web |date=2008-04-05 last obs |title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser: 136472 ({{mp|2005 FY|9}}) |work=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=136472 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> and was announced to the public on [[July 29]], [[2005]]. The discovery of {{dp|Eris}} was made public the same day, following the announcement of {{mpl|2003 EL|61}} two days earlier.<ref>{{cite web|title=His Stellar Discovery Is Eclipsed|author=Thomas H.

Despite its relative brightness (it is about a fifth as bright as Pluto),{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Makemake was not discovered until well after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the [[ecliptic]] (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater probability of finding objects there. Due to its relatively high orbital [[inclination]], and the fact that it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern [[constellation]] of [[Coma Berenices]],<ref name=Horizons>{{cite web |title = Asteroid 136472 Makemake (2005 FY9) |work=HORIZONS Web-Interface |publisher=JPL Solar System Dynamics |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&body_group=sb&sstr=2005FY9 |accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> it probably escaped detection from the earlier surveys.

Besides [[Pluto]], Makemake is the only other dwarf planet that was bright enough for [[Clyde Tombaugh]] to have possibly detected during his search for [[Planets beyond Neptune|trans-Neptunian planets]] around 1930.<ref name=brown2006/> At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]],{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} at an apparent magnitude of 16.0.<ref name=Horizons/> This position, however, was also very near the [[Milky Way]], and Makemake was almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto,<ref>{{cite web|title=Clyde W. Tombaugh|work=New Mexico Museum of Space History |url=http://www.nmspacemuseum.org/halloffame/detail.php?id=51|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref> but he failed to find Makemake or any other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.

===Name===
The [[provisional designation]] {{mp|2005 FY|9}} was given to Makemake when the discovery was made public. Before that, the discovery team used the codename "[[Easter Bunny|Easterbunny]]" for the object, because of its discovery shortly after [[Easter]].<ref name=brownblog/>

In July 2008, in accordance with IAU rules for classical Kuiper belt objects, {{mp|2005 FY|9}} was given the name of a [[creator deity]].

On [[August 24]], [[2006]], the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) announced a formal [[2006 definition of planet|definition of planet]] that established a tripartite classification for objects in orbit around the Sun: "[[small Solar System bodies]]" were those objects too small for their gravity to have collapsed their surfaces into a rounded shape; "[[dwarf planet]]s" were those objects large enough to be rounded, but who had yet to clear their orbits of similar-sized objects; "[[planet]]s" were those objects that were both large enough to be rounded by self-gravity and which had cleared their orbits of similar-sized objects.<ref name=IAU0603/> Under this classification, [[Pluto]], {{dp|Eris}} and {{dp|Ceres}} were reclassified as dwarf planets.<ref name=IAU0603>{{cite press release |date=2006-08-24 |publisher=International Astronomical Union (News Release - IAU0603) |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/ |accessdate=2007-12-31}} ([http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html orig link])</ref>

On [[June 11]], [[2008]], the IAU further elaborated on this classification scheme by creating a subclass of dwarf planet, [[plutoid]], specifically for those dwarf planets found beyond the orbit of Neptune. Eris and Pluto are thus plutoids, while Ceres is not. To be considered a plutoid, an object must be exceptionally bright and have an [[absolute magnitude]] of +1 or less,<ref>{{cite press release|date=2008-06-11 | location=Paris |title=Plutoid chosen as name for Solar System objects like Pluto |publisher=International Astronomical Union (News Release - IAU0804) |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0804 |accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> which meant that only Makemake and {{mpl-|136108|2003 EL|61}} were likely to be included.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Brown's Planets:Plutoid fever|author=Michael Brown|format = blog|year=2008|url= http://www.mikebrownsplanets.com/2008/06/plutoid-fever.html|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> On [[July 11]], [[2008]], the IAU/USGS Working Group on Planetary Nomenclature included Makemake in the plutoid class, making it officially both a dwarf planet and a plutoid, alongside Pluto and Eris.<ref name=name/><ref name=IAU0806>{{cite press release| publisher = International Astronomical Union (News Release - IAU0806)|title= Fourth dwarf planet named Makemake|author=International Astronomical Union|url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0806/|date=2008-07-19|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref>

==Physical characteristics==

As of July 2008 the rotation period of Makemake was not known, because it exhibits no discernible photometric variations.<ref name=Rabinowitz2007>{{cite journal|author=David L. Rabinowitz, Bradley E. Schaefer, Suzanne W. Tourtellotte |title=The Diverse Solar Phase Curves of Distant Icy Bodies. I. Photometric Observations of 18 Trans-Neptunian Objects, 7 Centaurs, and Nereid|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=133|pages=26&ndash;43|year=2007|doi=10.1086/508931| url=http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0605745|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref> There two possible reasons for this: Makemake's atmosphere could be frozen to its surface, rendering it fairly homogeneous, or it may be facing Earth pole-on. In the latter case a strong asymmetry is expected in the surface composition: the currently invisible summer hemisphere would have far fewer volatiles on it than the winter hemisphere.<ref name=Tegler2008/>

===Spectra===
In a letter written to the journal ''[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]]'' in 2006, Licandro ''et al.'' reported the measurements of the [[visible spectrum|visible]] and near [[Infrared spectrum#Infrared radiation|infrared spectrum]] of Makemake. They used the [[William Herschel Telescope]] and [[Telescopio Nazionale Galileo]] and showed that the surface of Makemake resembles that of Pluto.<ref name=atmosphere/> It like Pluto appears red in the visible spectrum, but significantly less red than the surface Eris (see [[trans-Neptunian object#Colors|colour comparison of TNOs]]).<ref name=atmosphere/> The near-infrared spectrum is marked by the presence of the broad [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) [[absorption band]]s. The methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.<ref name=atmosphere>{{cite journal|title=The methane ice rich surface of large TNO 2005 FY<sub>9</sub>: a Pluto-twin in the trans-neptunian belt?|author=J. Licandro, N. Pinilla-Alonso, M. Pedani, E. Oliva, G. P. Tozzi, W. M. Grundy |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |year=2006|volume=445|issue=3|doi= 10.1051/0004-6361:200500219| pages=L35&ndash;L38|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...445L..35L}}</ref>

Spectral analysis of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must be present in the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size.<ref name=brown/> In addition large amounts of [[ethane]] and [[tholins]] may be present as well, most likely created by [[photolysis]] of methane by solar radiation.<ref name=brown/> The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], where it composes more than 98&nbsp;percent of the crust.  The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.<ref name=brown/><ref name=Tegler2008>{{cite journal|title=Evidence of N2-ice on the surface of the icy dwarf Planet 136472 (2005 FY9)|author=S.C.

===Atmosphere===
The presence of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake could have a transient [[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] similar to that of Pluto near its [[apsis|perihelion]].<ref name=atmosphere/> Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it.<ref name=brown/> The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: since the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, the large amounts of nitrogen was probably lost via [[atmospheric escape]]; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (30&ndash;35&nbsp;K),{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane.<ref name=Schaller2007>{{cite journal|author=E.L.

A satellite having a brightness 1% of that of the primary would have been detected if it had been at the distance 0.4 [[arcsecond]]s or further from Makemake.<ref name=brown2006/> This contrasts with the other largest trans-Neptunian objects, which all possess at least one satellite: {{dp|Eris}} has [[Dysnomia (moon)|one]], {{mpl-|136108|2003 EL|61}} has [[2003 EL61#Moons|two]] and [[Pluto]] has [[Moons of Pluto|three]]. From 10% to 20% of all [[trans-Neptunian object]]s are expected to have one or more satellites.<ref name=brown2006/> Since satellites offer a simple method to measure an object's mass, lack of a satellite makes obtaining an accurate figure for Makemake's mass more difficult.<ref name=brown2006>{{cite journal|title=Satellites of the Largest Kuiper Belt Objects|author=M.

<div class="references-small">
<ol type="a">
<li>{{Note_label|A|a|none}} Astronomers [[Mike Brown]], [[David Jewitt]] and [[Marc Buie]] classify Makemake as a near [[scattered disc|scattered]] object but the [[Minor Planet Center]], from which Wikipedia draws most of its definitions for the trans-Neptunian population, places it among the main Kuiper belt population.<ref name=brown/><ref name=Delsanti2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/publications/preprints/06preprints/Delsanti_06-009.pdf|title=The Solar System Beyond The Planets|author=Audrey Delsanti, David Jewitt|publisher=University of Hawaii|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref><ref name=Buie/><ref name=MPC>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/TNOs.html|work=Minor Planet Center|title=List Of Transneptunian Objects|publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Chenter for Astrophysics|accessdate=2008-08-03}}</ref>.
<li>{{Note_label|B|b|none}} It has an [[apparent magnitude]] in [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] of 16.7 vs. [[Pluto#Appearance and composition|15 for Pluto]].<ref name=Rabinowitz2007/>
<li>{{Note_label|C|c|none}} Calculated using the formula <math>\begin{smallmatrix}T\ =\ \frac{T_{\textrm{eff}}(1-qp_{\nu})^{1/4}}{\sqrt{2}},\end{smallmatrix}</math> where T<sub>eff</sub> =54.8&nbsp;K at 52&nbsp;AU, <math>p_{\nu}</math>=0.78 is the geometrical albedo, ''q''=0.8 is the [[phase integral]]. T<sub>eff</sub> scales as <math>\begin{smallmatrix}1/\sqrt{r}\end{smallmatrix}</math>, where <math>r</math> is the distance from the Sun.  This formula is a simplified version of that in section 2.2 of Stansberry, ''et al.'', 2007,<ref name="Stansberry 2007"/> where emissivity and beaming paramter were assumed equal untiy, and <math>\pi</math> was replaced with 4 acconting for the difference between circle and sphere. All parameters mentioned above were taken from the same paper.
