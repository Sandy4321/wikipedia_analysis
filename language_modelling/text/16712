"'''Kidz'''" is a song by British pop group [[Take That]] from their sixth studio album, ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]]''. It was released as the second single from the album on February 20, 2011. The song features [[Mark Owen]] and [[Gary Barlow]] performing lead vocals. 

==Background==
The song was first announced as the album's second single when the group announced they were to perform the song live on ''[[The X Factor (UK series 7)|The X Factor]]'' final on 12 December 2010,<ref>Robertson, Colin.

Retrieved on 2011-01-04.</ref> however they instead performed "[[The Flood (Take That song)|The Flood]]" after [[Simon Cowell]] felt the song would reflect the recent riots and [[2010 UK student protests|protests over the rising student tuition fees]], due to their backing dancers being dressed as riot police.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s103/the-x-factor/news/a292878/cowell-bans-take-that-riot-cop-dancers.html</ref> "Kidz" was officially announced as the second single from ''Progress'' on 12 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next single from Progress|url=http://www.takethat.com/news/2011/01/next-single-from-progress|publisher=Takethat.com|accessdate=7 February 2011|date=12 January 2011}}</ref> The single artwork was posted onto Take That's official website on 7 February 2011.<ref name="Kidz Artwork">{{cite web|title=Kidz single artwork|url=http://www.takethat.com/news/2011/02/kidz-single-artwork|publisher=Takethat.com|accessdate=7 February 2011|date=7 February 2011}}</ref> The single was initially going to be released on February 28, 2011, but the date was moved forward to February 21, 2011.<ref name="Kidz Artwork"/>
The B side 'Rocket Ship' features Gary Barlow on lead vocals. The digital download was packaged with a remix entitled 'Revenge of the Kidz' which was mixed by Howard Donald.

==Critical reception==
"Kidz" has been referred to by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]'' as the highlight of ''[[Progress (Take That album)|Progress]]'' where the "reintroduction of Robbie Williams into the Take That ranks [has given] them a shot in the arm" concluding that "Kidz" is one of the "brilliantly mad future-disco titans".<ref>http://www.robbiewilliams.com/news-blogs/take-thats-second-single-is%E2%80%A6-kidz?page=0%2C1 Q Magazine/RWilliams Official 12-01-11</ref>
[[Entertainment.ie]] agreed with this view and described the single as a "stand out track" on the album with "a massive production kicking off with pounding drums, resonating piano and grimy synths."<ref>http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Take-That-Progress/7323.htm Entertainment.ie Jenny Mulligan</ref> Reality Shout music reviews also praised the song stating that "armed with the song-writing capabilities of Gary Barlow, the producing prowess of Stuart Price, Mark Owen's wheezy vocals, and Robbie Williams' gutsy, candid lyricism and confident delivery, 'Kidz' is a riotous cacophony of attitude, synth, relentless hooks and a monolithic chorus. It starts with the sound of stomping boots closing in, and ends with the sound of police sirens and screams; every tiny detail is crafted perfectly, right down to each individual beat."<ref>http://unrealityshout.com/blogs/single-review-take-kidz</ref> Nick Levine of [[Digital Spy]] also praised the song awarding it 5 stars and calling it a "rabble-rousing glam-disco-pop stomper with ambiguously apocalyptic lyrics and - not inappropriately - one ''hell'' of a chorus" comparing [[Mark Owen]]'s vocal to [[Liam Gallagher]] and referring to it as one of Take That's most thrilling releases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Nick|title=Music - Singles Review - Take That: 'Kidz' - Digital Spy|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a302470/take-that-kidz.html|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=7 February 2011|date=7 February 2011}}</ref>

==Music video==
The official music video for "Kidz" was filmed in [[Bulgaria]] in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Take That mobbed|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3407453/Take-That-mobbed.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom){{!}}The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International{{!}}News Group Newspapers Ltd.]]|accessdate=12 February 2011|date=12 February 2011}}</ref>
In the video Take That appear as conquering heroes from different ages of war.<ref>http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/bizarre/3435145/Take-That-go-military-in-Kidz-video.html</ref> The music video premiered through the official Take That iTunes App at 8am on 27 February 2011.

The video begins with images of television and warfare before switching to Jason Orange viewing the events on Earth from inside a spaceship which is named 'Progress'. Mark Owen begins to sing which is beamed live across the world whilst armed forces mass waiting for their arrival as Gary Barlow begins the descent into Earth's atmosphere. The spaceship is revealed to be shaped as the TT logo as it lands, sending a container down to the ground which opens to reveal Take That inside it. The members then walk towards the military forces in front of them as a child breaks through the line and takes a photograph of them to which they pose. They then return to the spaceship and leave Earth as the world dances behind them.
