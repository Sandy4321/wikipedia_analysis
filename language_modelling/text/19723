Major '''Nguy<U+1EC5>n V<U+0103>n Nhung''' (died January 1964) was an officer in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN). The bodyguard of General [[Duong Van Minh]], Nhung was a professional military [[hitman]] who was reputed to have etched a line on his [[revolver]] for each of his killings.<ref>Hammer, p. 298.</ref> He was well-known for his role in the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|November 1963 coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] that ousted President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] from office. During the coup, Nhung executed Diem, his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], and Colonel [[Le Quang Tung]], the loyalist commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces]]. An investigation led by General [[Tran Van Don]], another coup plotter, determined that Nhung had repeatedly stabbed and shot the Ngo brothers. Following [[Nguyen Khanh]]'s successful [[1964 South Vietnamese coup|January 1964 coup]] against Minh's [[military junta]], Nhung was executed. His death sparked public demonstrations by those who believed that it was a sign that Khanh was going to restore the remaining members of Diem's regime back to power.

On 1 November 1963, a group of ARVN generals orchestrated a coup against President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]. Nhung was an army officer who served as the bodyguard of one of the plotters, General [[Duong Van Minh]]. The plotters summoned a group of ARVN officers to the Joint General Staff headquarters at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]], on the pretext that they were going to attend a lunch meeting.<ref name="j408">Jones, p. 408.</ref> Among those invited was the loyalist commander of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces]], Colonel [[Le Quang Tung]]. At 13:30 ([[UTC]] 06:30), General [[Tran Van Don]] announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not, refusing to join the coup. He was taken away by Nhung, all the while shouting "Remember who gave you your stars!"<ref name="j408"/><ref name="encyc">Tucker, p. 227.</ref><ref name="ks"/>

At 16:45, Tung was forced [[at gunpoint]] to talk to Diem on the phone, telling the president that he had ordered his special forces to surrender. Minh then ordered Nhung to execute the Diem loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy for Tung, because the special forces commander had disguised his men in regular army uniforms and framed the generals for the [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids]] in August.<Ref name="j414"/><ref>Hammer, p. 290.</ref> The generals were well aware of the threat that Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning,<ref>Karnow, p. 310.</ref><ref>Jones, p. 325.</ref> having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.<ref>Jones, p. 388.</ref> At nightfall, Nhung took Tung and Major [[Le Quang Trieu]]&mdash;his brother and deputy<ref name="encyc"/><ref name="ks">Karnow, p. 321.</ref>&mdash;hands tied, into a jeep and drove them to the edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried.<ref name="j414">Jones, p. 414.</ref>

{{seealso|Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem}}

By the next morning, the loyalist forces had collapsed. The brothers agreed to surrender, and coup plotter Don promised them safe passage out of the country.<ref>Karnow, p. 322.</ref> In the meantime, Minh left Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters and travelled to  [[Ho Chi Minh City Museum|Gia Long Palace]] in a sedan, accompanied by Nhung. He arrived at the palace at 08:00 in full military uniform to supervise the arrest of Diem and Nhu for the surrender ceremony.<ref name="j418"/>

However, the Ngo brothers were not there&mdash;they had escaped from [[Ho Chi Minh City Museum|Gia Long Palace]] via a secret tunnel to a safehouse in [[Cholon]] the previous night.<Ref name="j418">Jones, p. 418.</ref><ref>Hammer, p. 293.</ref><ref name="k323">Karnow, p. 323.</ref> Diem and Nhu had communicated with the generals via a direct phone link from the safehouse to the palace, giving the false impression that they were still besieged.<Ref name="k323"/> Having been informed of Diem and Nhu's whereabouts, Minh dispatched a group of officers and troops&mdash;which included Nhung&mdash;to [[arrest]] them. He was aware that the brothers had left the safehouse to go to St. Francis Xavier's Church. Led by General [[Mai Huu Xuan]], the officers took a [[M113 Armored Personnel Carrier|M-113 armoured personnel carrier]] (APC), four jeeps, and several soldiers to Cholon. As they left, Minh gestured to Nhung with two fingers, taken to be an order to shoot the brothers.<Ref name="k323"/><ref>Jones, pp. 416&ndash;417.</ref>

The soldiers arrived at the church and promptly arrested the brothers, tying them with their hands behind their backs. After the arrest, Nhung and Major [[Duong Hieu Nghia]] sat with Diem and Nhu inside the APC, and the [[convoy]] departed for Tan Son Nhut. They stopped at a railroad crossing on the return trip where, by all accounts, the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Don later determined that Nghia had shot the brothers at [[point-blank range]] with a [[semi-automatic firearm]] and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing their bodies with a knife.<Ref name="k326">Karnow, p. 326.</Ref>

During the journey back, Nghia gave his account of the assassinations to military headquarters: "As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Diem sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [Nhung] began to insult each other. I don<U+2019>t know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion."<ref name="j429"/> When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghia said that Nhung "lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diem, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then he looked back at Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diem nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied."<ref name="j429"/> 

Don and other officers were stunned when the corpses arrived at JGS headquarters. Don confronted Minh in his office, and while they were remonstrating, Xuan entered the room. Unaware of Don's presence, Xuan snapped [[At attention|to attention]] and stated in [[French language|French]], "Mission accomplie".<ref name="j429">Jones, p. 429.</ref> Despite Don's investigation,<ref name="k326"/> nobody was ever prosecuted for the killings.<ref>Jones, p. 180.</ref>

Following the coup, Nhung's commanding officer, General Minh, became the President of South Vietnam, ruling through a [[military junta]] known as the Military Revolutionary Council.<ref name="pp">{{cite book|title=The Overthrow of Ngo Dinh Diem, May-November, 1963 |series=''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' |publisher=[[Daniel Ellsberg]] |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon2/pent6.htm |pages= 201&ndash;276|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> After three months of rule, which was criticised for its lack of direction,<ref>Shaplen, p. 213.</ref><ref>Karnow, pp. 350&ndash;354.</ref> General [[Nguyen Khanh]] deposed Minh in a bloodless coup before dawn on 30 January 1964. Minh was briefly put under [[house arrest]], while Khanh ordered that Nhung be disposed of. One of Khanh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon [[villa]] and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot to the back of the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diem's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.<ref name="d">Karnow, pp. 354&ndash;355.</ref>
