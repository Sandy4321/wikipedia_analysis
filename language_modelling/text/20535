==Background==
''Who You Are'' was one of the most anticipated releases of 2011 due to Jessie J winning the Critics Choice award at the [[2011 BRIT Awards]]<ref>[http://www.brits.co.uk/news/2011/2011-nominees/ BRIT Awards - Critics Choice - 2011 Nominees] www.brits.co.uk, Retrieved 30 January 2011.</ref> and topping the BBC's Sound of 2011 poll.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/soundof/2011/artists/jessiej/ Sound of 2011 - Jessie J] [[BBC]]'s Sound of 2011, Retrieved 8 December 2010.</ref> On [[Twitter]], Jessie J confirmed that it took her 6 years to completely finish the album - it was completed on 19 January 2011.<ref>[http://www.twitlonger.com/show/88m3qi Twitlonger on Twitter] by Jessie J's official Twitter. 19 January 2011</ref><ref>[http://twitter.com/jessiejofficial/status/27835942823792640 Twitter - by Jessie J] via Jessie J's official Twitter. 19 January 2011</ref> In an interview Jessie J stated that she wrote her first song, "Big White Room", at the age of 17, about when she was in hospital, at 11 years old. A ward mate of hers, a little boy, died. She recalls waking up in the middle of the night and seeing him praying, and her mother explaining that he was having an operation the next day and was asking God to save him. "He died the next day so I said to my mum 'but God didn't save him'. I was so angry and it really confused me. I always wanted to write a song about the experience, but I knew I had to be of an age where it wasn't tacky or depressing and had a lightness to it." She prefers the song with just an acoustic guitar; stripped down and bare.<ref name="Writing">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jessie-j--the-girl-from-essex-who-plans-to-take-the-pop-world-by-storm-2155567.html|title=Jessie J Talks about School life|author=[[The Independent]]|first=|last=|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=2011-01-28|work=Misformusic.com}}</ref>

The album's [[wikt:en:title track|title track]], "[[Who You Are (Jessie J song)|Who You Are]]", was released to the US [[iTunes Store]] on 22 February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/02/03/single-cover-jessie-j-casualty-of-love/ |title=Single Cover: Jessie J <U+2013> <U+2018>Casualty of Love<U+2019> |publisher=Rap-Up.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-07}}</ref>  It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on [[YouTube]], Twitter and [[Facebook]]. "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I want to be a positive role model for young people. I always say that I'm half-artist, half-therapist", she laughs. She wrote the song at the end of a lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so <U+2013> I'm not that girl. So I looked in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy."<ref name="Writing" />

Mike Diver of [[BBC Music]] gave a mixed review, writing that "the songs of ''Who You Are'' are expectedly split between slower, slushier affairs and punchy anthems for bolshy teens" and called the album "too patchy, too hurried, the powers behind it too eager to capitalise on the artist's current chart success", although he felt that "there's ample room for improvement".<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|last=Diver |first=Mike |title=Jessie J Who You Are Review |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/8rpn |accessdate=13 March 2011|publisher=''[[Virgin Media]]''|date= 24 February 2011}}</ref> Ailbhe Malone from ''[[NME]]'' described it as "cheeky, relevant, and fresh [...] but unfortunately [...] a flash that's shortly over" and noticed that "no matter how much Jessie J sings about being herself, we don't really ever get a sense of who, or what, that is".<ref name="nme">{{cite news|last=Malone |first=Ailbhe |title=Album Review: Jessie J <U+2013> Who You Are (Island) |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/jessie-j/11880 |accessdate=13 March 2011|publisher=''[[IPC Media]]''|date= 2 March 2011}}</ref> Gary McGinley of [[No Ripcord]] called it "an album of two halves as the stronger brat-pop moments soon give way to by insipid, dated ballads"; he noted that "there are glimpses of promise scattered between the overwrought delivery and unnecessary vocal gymnastics", but concluded by saying that ''Who You Are'' "promised much more than what has been delivered".<ref name="ripcord">{{cite news|last=McGinley |first=Gary |title= Jessie J Who You Are (Island) |url=http://www.noripcord.com/reviews/music/jessie-j/who-you-are |accessdate=13 March 2011|publisher=''[[No Ripcord]]''|date= 6 March 2011}}</ref> Fiona Shepherd  of ''[[The Scotsman]]'' wrote that it "covers all the tried and tested commercial territory: mainly a slick, generic imitation of American R&B divas [...] blended with the obligatory hip-pop stance" and felt that Cornish "is more interested in tiresome vocal showboating than communicating anything truthful".<ref name="scotsman">{{cite news|last=Shepherd |first=Fiona |title= Album review: Jessie J: Who You Are |url=http://news.scotsman.com/arts/Album-review-Jessie-J-Who.6725541.jp |accessdate=13 March 2011|publisher=''[[Johnston Press]]''|date= 1 March 2011}}</ref> Eric Henderson from [[Slant Magazine]] agreed, saying that "in the quest to find herself, she seems to have gotten sidetracked".<ref name="slant">{{cite news|last=Henderson |first=Eric |title= Jessie J Who You Are |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/jessie-j-who-you-are/2467 |accessdate=12 April 2011|publisher=''[[Slant Magazine]]''|date= 11 April 2011}}</ref> Matthew Perpetua of [[Pitchfork Media]] was particularly critical; he felt that "the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops" and noticed that Cornish "comes across like a severely dumbed-down [[Lily Allen]] at best, and at worst she seems like someone you would want to root against in a televised singing competition".<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite news|last=Perpetua |first=Matthew |title= Jessie J Who You Are |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15246-who-you-are/ |accessdate=25 March 2011|publisher=''[[Pitchfork Media]]''|date= 25 March 2011}}</ref> Sean Adams of [[Drowned in Sound]] was equally negative; he wrote that the album "is riddled with so-called vocal performances that are a half a step above an X Factor audition", called it "a starchy soulless slop" and eventually described it as "an 'urban' 'pop' record made to fade in the background in lobbies and cafes, and, yeah, mandem-mandem, squawk, squawk".<ref name="dis">{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Sean |title= Jessie J Who You Are |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16079/reviews/4142296 |accessdate=25 March 2011|publisher=''[[Drowned in Sound]]''|date= 23 March 2011}}</ref>
