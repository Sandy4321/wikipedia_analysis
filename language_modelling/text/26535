The '''great white shark''' (''Carcharodon carcharias''), also known as the '''great white''', '''white pointer''', '''white shark''', or '''white death''', is a species of large [[lamniformes|lamniform]] [[shark]] which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans. The great white shark is mainly known for its size, with mature individuals growing up to {{convert|6.4|m|0|abbr=on}} in length (although reports have been published of great white sharks measuring over {{convert|8|m|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=Taylor>{{cite book|author=Taylor, Leighton R. |title=Sharks of Hawaii: Their Biology and Cultural Significance|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aKwBKmwy7EEC|date=1 January 1993|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1562-2|page=65}}</ref> and {{convert|3324|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight).<ref name = "Tricas_1984">{{cite journal

==Taxonomy==
In 1758, [[Carolus Linnaeus]] gave the great white shark its first scientific name, ''Squalus carcharias''. Later, [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Sir Andrew Smith]] gave it ''Carcharodon'' as its [[genus|generic]] name in 1833, and also in 1873. The generic name was identified with Linnaeus' [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] and the current scientific name ''Carcharodon carcharias'', was finalised. ''Carcharodon'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''karcharos'', which means sharp or jagged, and ''odous'', which means tooth.<ref name="abc">

===Ancestry and fossil record===
The great white shark came into existence during the mid-[[Miocene]] epoch. The earliest known fossils of the great white shark are about 16 million years old.<ref name="CA">{{Cite journal|last=Gottfried |first=M. D. |last2=Fordyce |first2=R. E.|title=An associated specimen of ''Carcharodon angustidens'' (''Chondrichthyes, Lamnidae'') from the Late Oligocene of New Zealand, with comments on ''Carcharodon'' interrelationships|year=2001|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume =21|issue=4|pages=730<U+2013>739|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2001)021[0730:AASOCA]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> However, the [[phylogeny]] of the great white is still in dispute. The original hypothesis for the great white's origins is that it shares a common ancestor with a [[prehistoric]] shark, such as the [[Megalodon|''C.&nbsp;megalodon'']]. Similarities among the physical remains and the extreme size of both the great white and ''C.&nbsp;megalodon'' led many scientists to believe these sharks were closely related, and the name ''Carcharodon megalodon'' was applied to the latter. However, a new hypothesis proposes that the ''C.&nbsp;megalodon'' and the great white are distant relatives (albeit sharing the family [[Lamnidae]]). The great white is also more closely related to an ancient [[mako shark]], ''Isurus hastalis'', than to the ''C.&nbsp;megalodon'', a theory that seems to be supported with the discovery of a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae of the extinct [[transitional species]] [[Carcharodon hubbelli]] in 1988 and published on 14 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121114172939.htm|date=14 November 2012|title=New Ancient Shark Species Gives Insight Into Origin of Great White|publisher=University of Florida|website=sciencedaily.com}}</ref> In addition, the new hypothesis assigns ''C.&nbsp;megalodon'' to the genus ''Carcharocles'', which also comprises the other megatoothed sharks; ''[[Otodus obliquus]]'' is the ancient representative of the extinct ''Carcharocles'' lineage.<ref name="Trace">{{Cite journal|author=Kevin G.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Carcharodon carcharias.jpg|thumb|Great white shark off [[Guadalupe Island]], [[Mexico]]]]
Great white sharks live in almost all coastal and offshore waters which have water temperature between {{convert|12|and|24|C|F|0}}, with greater concentrations in the [[United States]] ([[Atlantic Northeast]] and [[California]]), [[South Africa]], [[Japan]], [[Oceania]], [[Chile]], and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/wsdistro.html |title=Areal Distribution of the White Shark |publisher=National Capital Freenet |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> One of the densest known populations is found around [[Gansbaai, Western Cape|Dyer Island, South Africa]], where almost all of the shark research is done.

The great white is an [[Pelagic zone|epipelagic]] fish, observed mostly in the presence of rich game, such as [[fur seal]]s, [[sea lion]]s, [[cetacean]]s, other sharks, and large bony fish species. In the open ocean, it has been recorded at depths as great as {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="deep">{{Cite news| last = Thomas| first =Pete| title = Great white shark amazes scientists with 4000-foot dive into abyss| publisher = GrindTV| date = 5 April 2010| url = http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/blog/16855/great+white+shark+amazes+scientists+with+4000-foot+dive+into+abyss/| accessdate = <!-----19 May 2010----->|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120817230049/http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/blog/16855/great+white+shark+amazes+scientists+with+4000-foot+dive+into+abyss/|archivedate=17 August 2012}}</ref> These findings challenge the traditional notion about the great white as being a coastal species.<ref name="deep" />

According to a recent study, [[California]] great whites have migrated to an area between [[Baja California]] and [[Hawaii]] known as the [[White Shark Caf<U+00E9>]] to spend at least 100 days before migrating back to Baja. On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. After they arrive, they change behavior and do short dives to about {{convert|300|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off of the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year. This refuted traditional theories that white sharks are coastal territorial predators and opens up the possibility of interaction between shark populations that were previously thought to have been discrete. The reasons for their migration and what they do at their destination is still unknown. Possibilities that may support this idea include seasonal feeding or mating.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/sep/29/sports/sp-outdoors29|publisher="Los Angeles Times"|title=The Great White Way|accessdate=1 October 2006|first=Pete|last=Thomas|date=29 September 2006}}</ref> A similar study tracked a great white shark from South Africa swimming to Australia's northwestern coast and back, a journey of {{convert|20000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} in under nine months.<ref name="WSharkTrust">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitesharktrust.org/migration/main.html|publisher="White Shark Trust"|title=South Africa <U+2013> Australia <U+2013> South Africa }}</ref>

==Anatomy and appearance==
The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some [[mackerel shark]]s.

A great white displays [[countershading]], by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight.

Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of [[Shark tooth|serrated teeth]] behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.<ref name="marinbioGW"/>

Some researchers question these measurements' reliability, noting they were much larger than any other accurately reported sighting. This New Brunswick shark may have been a misidentified [[basking shark]], as the two have similar body shapes. The question of the Port Fairy shark was settled in the 1970s when J.&nbsp;E. Randall examined the shark's jaws and <!--The following quote is taken verbatim from the source; please DO NOT change the wording or spelling.

One contender in maximum size is the [[tiger shark]], ''Galeocerdo cuvier''. While tiger sharks which are typically both a few feet smaller and have a leaner, less heavy body structure than white sharks, have been confirmed to reach at least {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} in the length, an unverified specimen was reported to have measured {{convert|7.4|m|ft}} in length and weighed {{convert|3110|kg|lb}}.<ref name="Wood" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Gc/Gc_large.html|title=Summary of Large Tiger Sharks ''Galeocerdo cuvier'' (Peron & LeSueur, 1822)|accessdate=3 May 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120410200248/http://homepage.mac.com/mollet/Gc/Gc_large.html|archivedate=10 April 2012}}</ref> Some other macropredatory sharks such as the [[Greenland shark]], ''Somniosus microcephalus'', and the [[Pacific sleeper shark]], ''Somniosus pacificus'', are also reported to rival these sharks in length (but probably weigh a bit less since they more slender in build than a great white) in exceptional cases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eagle|first=Dane|title=Greenland Shark|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/Gallery/Descript/GreenlandShark/GreenlandShark.html|work=Florida Museum of Natural History|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=R.

With a single bite a great white can take in up to {{convert|14|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of flesh, and can also consume several hundred kilograms of food.

The largest great white recognized by the [[International Game Fish Association]] (IGFA) is one caught by Alf Dean in the south Australian waters in 1959, weighing {{convert|1208|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="EllisMcCosker"/> Several larger great whites caught by anglers have since been verified, but were later disallowed from formal recognition by IGFA monitors for rules violations.

===Adaptations===
[[File:Great white shark 1001.jpg|thumb|A great white shark swimming|alt=Photo of shark swimming at water surface]]
Great white sharks, like all other sharks, have an extra sense given by the [[Ampullae of Lorenzini]] which enables them to detect the electromagnetic field emitted by the movement of living animals.  Every time a living creature moves, it generates an electrical field and great whites are so sensitive they can detect half a billionth of a [[volt]]. Even heart beats emit a very faint electrical pulse. If it is close enough, the shark can detect even that faint electrical pulse. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's [[lateral line]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The physiology of the ampullae of Lorenzini in sharks|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|work=Biology Dept., Davidson College|publisher=Biology @ Davidson|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>

To more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a "[[rete mirabile]]" (Latin for "wonderful net").

===Bite force===
A 2007 study from the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], used [[computerized tomography|CT]] scans of a shark's skull and computer models to measure the shark's maximum bite force. The study reveals the forces and behaviors its skull is adapted to handle and resolves competing theories about its feeding behavior.<ref>{{cite news|last=Medina|first=Samantha|title=Measuring the great white's bite|url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1499|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=Cosmos Magazine|date=27 July 2007}}</ref>  In 2008, a team of scientists led by Stephen Wroe conducted an experiment to determine the great white shark's jaw power and findings indicated that a specimen more than {{convert|6.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long could exert a bite force of over {{convert|18000|N|lbf|lk=on}}.<ref name="GWB" />

==Ecology and behavior==
[[File:Great white shark at his back11.jpg|thumb|A great white shark turns onto its back while hunting tuna [[Fishing bait|bait]]|alt=Photo of inverted shark at surface]]
This shark's behavior and social structure is not well understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a [[dominance hierarchy]] depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when another shark approaches too closely to another great white, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.

The great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as [[Spyhopping|spy-hopping]]. This behavior has also been seen in at least one group of [[blacktip reef shark]]s, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). The white sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable "clans" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a fascinating variety of interactions.<ref name="NHmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/201391/sociable-killers|title=Sociable Killers|author=Martin, R.

[[File:White shark (Carcharodon carcharias) scavenging on whale carcass - journal.pone.0060797.g004-A.png|thumb|A great white shark scavenging on a whale carcass]]
Great white sharks are [[carnivorous]] and prey upon [[fish]] (e.g. [[tuna]], [[Batoidea|ray]]s,<ref name="NHmag"/> other [[shark]]s<ref name="NHmag"/>), [[cetaceans]] (i.e., [[dolphin]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[whale]]s), [[pinniped]]s (e.g. [[Earless seal|seal]]s, [[fur seal]]s,<ref name="NHmag"/> and [[sea lion]]s), [[sea turtle]]s,<ref name="NHmag"/> [[sea otter]]s, and [[seabirds]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Johnson| first = R.

Shark expert Peter Klimley used a rod-and-reel rig and trolled carcasses of a seal, a pig, and a sheep from his boat in the South [[Farallon Islands|Farallons]]. The sharks attacked all three baits but rejected the sheep carcass.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/b_catch.htm |title=Catch as Catch Can |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>

The great white shark's reputation as a ferocious predator is well-earned, yet they are not (as was once believed) indiscriminate "eating machines". They are ambush hunters, taking prey by surprise from below. Near [[Seal Island, South Africa|Seal Island]], in South Africa's [[False Bay]], shark attacks most often occur in the morning, within 2 hours after sunrise, when visibility is poor. Their success rate is 55% in the first 2 hours, falling to 40% in late morning after which hunting stops.<ref name="NHmag" />

Hunting techniques vary by species of the prey. Off Seal Island, the sharks ambush [[brown fur seal]]s from below at high speeds, hitting the seal mid-body. They go so fast that they can completely leave the water. The peak burst speed of these sharks is largely accepted in the scientific community to be above {{convert|40|km/h|mph}}. However further precision is still speculative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/topics/p_shark_speed.htm |title=How Fast Can a Shark Swim? |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research }}</ref> They have also been observed chasing prey after a missed attack. Prey is usually attacked at the surface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/predation.htm |title=White Shark Predatory Behavior at Seal Island |publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research}}</ref>

Off California, sharks immobilize [[Northern Elephant Seal|northern elephant seal]]s with a large bite to the hindquarters (which is the main source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals which can be as large or larger than the hunter and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. [[Harbour seal]]s are taken from the surface and dragged down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. [[California sea lion]]s are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being dragged and eaten.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Rick|url=http://www.sharkresearchcommittee.com/predation.htm |title=Predatory Behavior of Pacific Coast White Sharks |publisher=Shark Research Committee}}</ref>

Off The East Coast of North America, where white sharks are still poorly understood, individuals have been filmed and documented hunting [[grey seals]]. When hunting, atlantic great whites will hunt very close to shore, unlike their counterparts elsewhere which prefer deeper water for ambush and breach attacks. The sharks also utilize sandbars to set up ambushes, and will then chase the seals in a flat-out pursuit. This behavior was revealed to the public media during two episodes of [[Shark Week]], the first being "Jaws Comes Home" and the second being "Return of Jaws".

White sharks also attack dolphins and porpoises from above, behind or below to avoid being detected by their [[Animal echolocation#Toothed whales|echolocation]]. Targeted species include [[dusky dolphin]]s,<ref name="GWS" /> [[Risso's dolphin]]s,<ref name="GWS" /> [[bottlenose dolphin]]s,<ref name="GWS" /><ref name="Competition">{{cite journal |last=Heithaus |first=Michael |title=Predator<U+2013>prey and competitive interactions between sharks (order Selachii) and dolphins (suborder Odontoceti): a review |journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=253|pages=53<U+2013>68 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |year=2001 |url=http://www.science.fau.edu/sharklab/courses/elasmobiology/readings/heithaus.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0952836901000061 |accessdate=26 February 2010}}</ref> [[Humpback dolphin]]s,<ref name="Competition" /> [[harbour porpoise]]s,<ref name="GWS" /> and [[Dall's porpoise]]s.<ref name="GWS" /> Close encounters between dolphins and predatory sharks often result in evasive responses by the dolphins.<ref name="Competition" /> However, in rare cases, a group of dolphins may chase a single predatory shark away in an act of defense.<ref name="Competition" /> White shark predation on other species of small cetacean has also been observed.

[[File:A beachcomber is looking at the marks of great white sharks bites.jpg|thumb|A beachcomber looking at bite marks on a beached whale from a great white shark]]
Even though the great whites are known to generally avoid conflicts with each other, the phenomenon of [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]] is not alien to this species. Large individuals may aggressively interact intraspecifically with small individuals. A {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long great white shark was nearly bitten into two by a reportedly {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long great white shark in Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane in Australia.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Monster shark bites great white in half|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=Australia|date=27 October 2009|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/monster-shark-bites-great-white-in-half/story-e6freuy9-1225791557651}}</ref>

White sharks also scavenge on whale carcasses. In one such documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.<ref>{{cite web| last = Dudley| first = Sheldon F.

===Reproduction===
Almost nothing is known about reproduction in great whites. Some evidence points to the near-soporific effect of a large feast (such as a whale carcass) possibly inducing mating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/Great_white_shark_feeding_on_whale_carcass|title=Great White Shark Feeding On Whale Carcass|publisher=wn.com}}</ref> Great white sharks also reach sexual maturity at around 15 years of age.<ref>{{cite web| title = Natural History of the White Shark | url= http://www.prbo.org/cms/176 | date = 2 May 2010| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130703015943/http://www.prbo.org/cms/176 | archivedate = 3 July 2013 | publisher = PRBO Conservation Science}}</ref> Maximum life span is believed to be more than 30 years (see [[Great white shark#References|references]]).

Little is known about the great white shark's behavior in the way of [[mating]] habits. Birth has never been observed, but pregnant females have been examined. Great white sharks are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]], which means eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=38|title=Carcharodon carcharias, Great White Sharks|publisher=marinebio.org}}</ref> The great white has an 11-month gestation period. The shark pup's powerful jaws begin to develop in the first month. The unborn sharks participate in [[oophagy]], in which they feed on [[ovum|ova]] produced by the mother. Delivery is in spring and summer.<ref name="www.elasmo-research.org">{{Cite web | title = Brief Overview of the Great White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias'')| url = http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/overview.htm  | publisher = Elasmo Research | accessdate = 20 August 2012 }}</ref> The Northern Pacific population of great whites is suspected to breed off of the Sea of Cortez (as was revealed in the Shark Week episode "Spawn of Jaws"), as evidenced by local fisherman who have said to have caught them and evidenced by teeth found at dump sites for discarded parts from their catches. If the Sea of Cortez is such a breeding ground, it is imperative that the area's laws be better enforced to ensure the survival of the breeding population.

===Breaching behaviour===
A [[Whale surfacing behavior|breach]] is the result of a high speed approach to the surface with the resulting momentum taking the shark partially or completely clear of the water. This is a hunting technique employed by great white sharks whilst hunting seals. This behavior often takes place on cape fur seals at [[Seal Island, South Africa|Seal Island]] in [[False Bay, South Africa]] but due to the randomness of the location of a shark's breach, it was very hard to document. It was first photographed by [[Chris Fallows]] and Rob Lawrence who developed the technique of towing a slow moving seal decoy to trick the sharks to breach.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/breaching.htm | title=White Shark Breaching | publisher=ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research | accessdate=18 April 2012 | author=Martin, R.

They can reach speeds of up to {{convert|40|km/h|mph}} and can at times launch themselves more than {{convert|10|ft|m}} into the air. Data recorded shows that the sharks are successful in just under 50% of all these natural predatory events.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1017/S002531540501218X}}</ref> In 2011, a {{convert|3|m|ft}} long shark jumped onto a seven-person [[research vessel]] off Seal Island in Mossel Bay.

==Relationship with humans==

===Shark attacks===
{{Main|Shark attack}}
Of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark attacks on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked attacks on humans in which the great white shark was identified as of 2012.<ref name="isaf" />

More than any documented attack, [[Peter Benchley]]'s best-selling novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]'' and the subsequent [[Jaws (film)|1975 film adaptation]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] provided the great white shark with the image of being a "[[man eater]]" in the public mind.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Benchley |year=2000 |month=April |title=Great white sharks |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |page=12 |quote=considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years, I couldn't possibly write Jaws today ... not in good conscience anyway ... back then, it was OK to demonize an animal. |issn=00279358}}</ref> While great white sharks have killed humans in at least 74 documented unprovoked attacks in which the species was identified, they typically do not target them: for example, in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] there have been 31 confirmed attacks against humans in the last two centuries, most of which were non-fatal. Many of the incidents seemed to be "test-bites". Great white sharks also test-bite [[buoy]]s, [[flotsam]], and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a [[surfboard]] to identify what it is.
[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|thumb|left|The great white shark is one of only four kinds of sharks that have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans.|alt=Photo of open-mouthed shark at surface.]]
Other incidents seem to be cases of mistaken identity, in which a shark ambushes a bather or surfer from below, believing the silhouette is from a seal. Many attacks occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth attacking. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.<ref>{{cite web|first=Meghan|last=McCabe|title=Sharks: Killing Machines?|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f00/web1/mccabe.html|year=2000}}</ref>

However, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s John McCosker, the Chair of Aquatic Biology at California Academy, noted that divers who dove solo and were attacked by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their buddy. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the [[University of Hawaii]], suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.<ref>{{cite journal| first= T.C.| last=Tricas| coauthors=McCosker, John | title= [[California Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences]]| journal=Predatory behavior of the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'', and notes on its biology| volume=43| issue=14| pages=221<U+2013>238| year=1984 }}</ref>

Humans are not appropriate prey because the shark's digestion is too slow to cope with a human's high ratio of bone to muscle and fat. Accordingly, in most recorded attacks, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 until 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark attacks, 29 fatal.<ref>{{cite web|title=ISAF Statistics for Worldwide Unprovoked White Shark Attacks Since 1990|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/White/whitesharkdecade.html|date=10 February 2011| accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>

===Attacks on boats===
Great white sharks infrequently attack and sometimes even sink boats. Only five of the 108 authenticated unprovoked shark attacks reported from the Pacific Coast during the 20th century involved [[kayak]]ers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sharkresearchcommittee.com/unprovoked_kayaker.htm|title = Unprovoked White Shark Attacks on Kayakers| publisher = Shark Research Committee| accessdate = 14 September 2008}}</ref> In a few cases they have attacked boats up to {{convert|10|m}} in length. They have bumped or knocked people overboard, usually attacking the boat from the stern. In one case in 1936, a large shark leapt completely into the [[South Africa]]n fishing boat ''Lucky Jim'', knocking a crewman into the sea. Tricas and McCosker's underwater observations suggest that sharks are attracted to boats due to the electrical fields they generate.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tricas|first1=Timothy C.|last2=McCosker|first2=John E.|title=Predatory Behaviour of the White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias''), with Notes on its Biology|year=1984|journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences|volume=43|issue=14|pages=221<U+2013>238|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/fishlab/pubs/Tricas%20&%20McCosker%201984.pdf}}</ref>

===Great white sharks in captivity===
[[File:Great white aqurium.jpg|thumb|left|Great white shark in the [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in September 2006|alt=Photo of shark]]
Prior to August 1981, no great white shark in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a white shark survived for 16 days at [[SeaWorld]] [[San Diego]] before being released.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/science/2004-10-02-great-white_x.htm |title=Great white shark sets record at California aquarium |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2 October 2004| accessdate=27 September 2006}}</ref>  The idea of containing a live great white at [[SeaWorld]] [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] was used in the 1983 film ''[[Jaws 3-D]]''.

In July 2003, Monterey researchers captured a small female and kept it in a large netted pen near [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] for five days.

Cage diving is most common at sites where great whites are frequent including the coast of South Africa, the [[Neptune Islands]] in South Australia,<ref>{{cite web|title=Shark cage diving|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/enjoy/shark-cage-diving|publisher=Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources|accessdate=11 March 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130409072843/http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/marineparks/Enjoy/shark-cage-diving|archivedate=9 April 2013}}</ref> and Guadalupe Island in [[Baja California]]. Cage diving and swimming with sharks is a focus for a booming tourist industry due to its popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/256863.stm|title=Swimming With Sharks|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 1999|accessdate=21 January 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030817170427/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/256863.stm|archivedate=17 August 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simon|first=Bob|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/06/60minutes/main1099368.shtml|title=Swimming With Sharks|publisher=[[60 Minutes]]|date=11 December 2005|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> A common practice is to [[chumming|chum]] the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.

At present, hang baits are illegal off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive operators do not use them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and pinniped decoys.<ref name="www.bluewaterhunter.com">{{Cite web | title = Blue Water Hunting Successfully | url = http://www.bluewaterhunter.com/education/education_successfully.html | publisher = Blue Water Hunter | accessdate = 20 August 2012 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120818030820/http://www.bluewaterhunter.com/education/education_successfully.html | archivedate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these suggested advisories.<ref name="www.bluewaterhunter.com"/>

The shark tourist industry has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch a one-time price of up to <U+00A3>20,000. However, that is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark, a more sustainable economic activity. For example, the dive industry in [[Gansbaai]], [[South Africa]], consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between <U+00A3>50 to <U+00A3>150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between <U+00A3>9,000 and <U+00A3>27,000 of revenue daily.<ref name="wn.com">{{Cite web  | title = White Shark Manifesto-kelp Forests | url = http://wn.com/White_Shark_Manifesto-Kelp_Forests | publisher = World News | accessdate = 20 August 2012 }}</ref>

==Conservation status==
It is unclear how much of a concurrent increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable.<ref name=iucn/> Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.

The [[IUCN]] notes that very little is known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears uncommon compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]].<ref name=iucn/> It is included in [[CITES Appendix II|Appendix II]] of [[CITES]],<ref name=CITES/> meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.shtml#IV |title=Regulation of Trade in Specimens of Species Included in Appendix II|publisher=CITES (1973)|accessdate=8 April. 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110717182355/http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.shtml#IV|archivedate=17 July 2011}}</ref> As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the [[Bonn Convention|CMS]] [[Migratory Sharks MoU]], which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks | url = http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf | accessdate = 31 August 2012 | publisher = Convention on Migratory Species| date=12 February 2010 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130420171816/http://www.cms.int/species/sharks/MoU/Migratory_Shark_MoU_Eng.pdf | archivedate=20 April 2013}}</ref> A February 2010 study by [[Barbara Block]] of [[Stanford University]] estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the [[tiger]], whose population is in the same range.<ref>{{cite news |title=Great white shark is more endangered than tiger, claims scientist |author=Sample, Ian |url=http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/19/great-white-shark-endangered-tiger |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

Fishermen target many sharks for their jaws, teeth, and fins, and as game fish in general. The great white shark, however, is rarely an object of commercial fishing, although its flesh is considered valuable. If casually captured (it happens for example in some [[tonnara|tonnare]] in the [[Mediterranean]]), it is misleadingly sold as ''[[smooth-hound shark]]''.

===In Australia===
The great white shark was declared as Vulnerable by the Australian Government in 1999 due to significant population decline and is currently protected under the [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999|Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act]].<ref name="epbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64470|title=Species Profile and Threats Database <U+2013> ''Carcharodon carcharias'' <U+2014> Great White Shark|author=Government of Australia.|accessdate=21 August 2013}}</ref> The causes of decline prior to protection included mortality from [[sport fishing]] harvests as well as being caught in beach protection netting.<ref name="au2002">{{cite report|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias-recovery-plan|title=White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias'') Recovery Plan|year=2002|author=Environment Australia}}</ref>

The national conservation status of the great white shark is reflected by all Australian states under their respective laws, granting the species full protection throughout Australia regardless of jurisdiction.<ref name="epbc" /> In fact, many states had prohibited the killing or possession of great white sharks prior to national legislation coming into effect. The great white shark is further listed as Threatened in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, and as rare or likely to become extinct under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife Conservation Act in [[Western Australia]].<ref name="epbc" />

In 2002, the Australian government created the White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation in addition to federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities.<ref name="au2002" /> An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions.<ref name="au2013">{{cite report|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/resource/recovery-plan-white-shark-carcharodon-carcharias|title=Recovery Plan for the White Shark (''Carcharodon carcharias'')|year=2013|author=Government of Australia Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities}}</ref> A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into [[population genetics|genetically distinct]] eastern and western populations, indicating a need for the development of regional conservation strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blower|first1=Dean C.|last2=Pandolfi|first2=John M.|last3=Bruce|first3=Barry D.|last4=Gomez-Cabrera|first4=Maria del C.|last5=Ovenden|first5=Jennifer R.|year=2012|title=Population genetics of Australian white sharks reveals fine-scale spatial structure, transoceanic dispersal events and low effective population sizes|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=455|pages=229<U+2013>244|doi=10.3354/meps09659|url=http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v455/p229-244/}}</ref>

Presently, human-caused shark mortality is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing as well as from being caught in beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.<ref name="au2013" />

===In New Zealand===
As of April 2007, great white sharks were fully protected within {{convert|370|km|nmi}} of [[New Zealand]] and additionally from fishing by New Zealand-flagged boats outside this range. The maximum penalty is a $250,000 fine and up to six months in prison.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10413182| title=Great white sharks to be protected | publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]| date=30 November 2006| accessdate=30 November 2006}}</ref>

===In North America===
In 2013, great white sharks were added to California's Endangered Species Act. From data collected, the population of great whites in the North Pacific is estimated to be fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/04/great-white-sharks-are-now-protected-under-california-law/ | title=Great White Sharks Are Now Protected under California Law | author=Quan, Kristene | publisher=time.com | date=4 March 2013}}</ref>
