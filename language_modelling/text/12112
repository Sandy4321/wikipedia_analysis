The '''Alberta general election of 1997''' was the twenty-fourth general election for the Province of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It was held on [[March 11]] [[1997]] to elect members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].

[[Ralph Klein]]'s second election as leader of the [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives|Progressive Conservative Party]] was considerably more successful than his first. The PC Party won over half the popular vote, and 63 of the 83 seats in the legislature for its eighth consecutive term in government. 

The [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] of [[Grant Mitchell (politician)|Grant Mitchell]] lost about 7% of the popular vote it had won in the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 election]]. The party's legislative caucus was reduced from 32 members to 18.

[[Pam Barrett]] led the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party]] back into the legislature with two seats (both in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]), despite winning an even smaller share of the popular vote than in 1993.

The [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]] also re-emerged, but did not win any seats.
