'''John Grosvenor Rowland''' (born May 24, 1957) is a former American politician and current political commentator. He was the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|86th]] [[Governor of Connecticut]] from 1995 to 2004; he is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is married to Patty Rowland, his second wife, and the couple have five children between them. In 2004, Rowland resigned from office during a corruption investigation, and later pleaded guilty in federal court to a one-count indictment for conspiracy to commit [[honest services fraud]], [[mail fraud]] and [[tax fraud]].<ref>[http://library.findlaw.com/2002/Jul/8/132494.html Honest Services Mail Fraud] defined and discussed at Findlaw.com. Accessed March 17, 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041223.html US Dept of Justice Press Release]</ref> He was the first Connecticut governor to be elected to three terms since 1784.

He served ten months in a federal prison until February 10, 2006, followed by four months [[house arrest]] at his home in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]], until June 2006. His [[Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut|lieutenant governor]], [[M. Jodi Rell]], replaced him as governor.

==Political career==
Rowland's political career began in 1980 when, at age 23, he was elected to the [[Connecticut State House of Representatives]]. He held his seat until 1984, when he was elected to represent [[Connecticut's 5th congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and was reelected in 1986 and 1988.

After losing the 1990 gubernatorial race to [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], Rowland worked as a consultant for [[United Technologies]] Corp. He was later elected governor in 1994 at age 37 (the youngest governor in Connecticut history) and later defeated two Democratic opponents: former US Congresswoman [[Barbara Bailey Kennelly]] (63%<U+2013>35%) in 1998 and former State [[Comptroller]] [[Bill Curry (politician)|Bill Curry]] (56%<U+2013>44%) in 2002.

Rowland was the only Republican re-elected Governor of Connecticut in a 50-year period. He was the first governor elected to a third, four-year term after the 1950 election. (Some previous governors did serve at least three terms; each term was one year until 1876, two years after.) His plurality over Kennelly in 1998 was among the largest recorded for any Connecticut politician.

Rowland resigned as Governor of Connecticut effective July 1, 2004. Lieutenant Governor M. Jodi Rell served out the remainder of his term. Rowland is the only Connecticut governor to have ever faced impeachment and he is the only Connecticut governor to have served prison time.

==Accomplishment as Governor==
During the years that Rowland was in office, the state enjoyed record-breaking surpluses, state spending increased only modestly, with real spending growth rates of just over 2 percent annually between 1995 and 2003. For the first time in state history, tax rebate checks were sent to taxpayers in 1998 and again in 1999. He adhered to a spending cap voters added to the state constitution in 1992.

During those years, the state invested more than $2&nbsp;billion to rebuild the [[University of Connecticut]]. Major investments were also made in the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] and [[List of community colleges#Connecticut|Community Technical College]] systems; enrollments as of 2004 were at an all-time high.

As of 2004, Connecticut students led the nation in performance, and the number of spaces in pre-school programs more than doubled during his term in office.

During his term, more than {{convert|455000|acre|km2}} (700+ sq. miles) of open space were preserved for future generations and state parks were revitalized. Rowland also led an aggressive clean-up and protection effort for Long Island Sound.

The [[Connecticut Convention Center|Adriaen<U+2019>s Landing]] project, the most ambitious capital city development project in decades in the state, continued to progress during Rowland's time in office. College campuses were moved, which brought thousands downtown in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]]. [[New London, Connecticut|New London]]'s waterfront was thriving as of 2004, with a new global research facility and rebuilt pier. Theaters and museums in all major cities were revitalized, from the Palace Theater in Waterbury to the [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]]'s [[New Britain Museum of American Art|Museum of American Art]].

In 1998, Rowland implemented the [[Husky (disambiguation)|HUSKY Plan]] (Healthcare for UninSured Kids and Youth) to provide [[health insurance]] to uninsured Connecticut children. During his tenure, the budget for the [[Connecticut Department of Children and Families|Department of Children and Families]] more than doubled. Rowland supported addition to government of the state<U+2019>s first Child Advocate.<ref>[http://www.ct.gov/governorrowland/cwp/view.asp?a=3&Q=260294&governorrowlandNav=|State of Connecticut Archive of Governor's Bio]</ref>

Rowland was a strong proponent of a tough stance against [[violent crime]] as Governor. The prison population grew rapidly during his term, which caused the state to send inmates to prisons in [[Virginia]] to deal with [[Private prison|overcrowding]]. Legislative opponents of this policy such as Representative [[Michael Lawlor]] urged more rapid release of nonviolent offenders.<ref>[http://www.nhregister.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10094416&BRD=1281&PAG=461&dept_id=31007&rfi=8 News Item], New Haven Register.</ref> After Rowland left office the Virginia inmates were returned to Connecticut and more criminals were paroled.<ref>[http://www.pewpublicsafety.org/pdfs/Connecticut%20Case%20Study%202-22-07.pdf Public Safety Performance] produced by the [[Pew Center on the States]].</ref> This approach was criticized after the 2007 Cheshire [[home invasion]] murders committed by two "nonviolent" inmates paroled from Connecticut prison.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hc-parole0801.artaug01,0,3665655.story?coll=hc_tab01_layout Parole] at Courant.com</ref>

Before investigation into his conduct as governor started, Rowland was viewed as a rising star in the Republican Party, and was mentioned as a future presidential or vice-presidential candidate.<ref>[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/john_g_rowland/index.html?offset=150&&|John G. Rowland News: Topical Coverage], New York Times</ref>

Shortly after being released from prison, he was offered a job as the city of Waterbury's economic development coordinator. Rowland was appointed to this office by [[crony|long time friend and associate]], Mayor [[Michael Jarjura]].

==Corruption as Governor==
===Impeachment process and federal case===
In the first year of Rowland's third term (2003), rumors began circulating that contractors doing business with the state paid for and made improvements to his weekend cottage, that he benefited improperly from the sale of a condominium in Washington, D.C. at an inflated price, that he took gifts from subordinates in state government, and that he took partial ownership in businesses immediately before they were granted state contracts. These eventually led to federal investigations and then indictments of some of Rowland's close aides, who then cooperated with federal investigators.

Rumors continued that the investigation was building a case against Rowland himself; Rowland publicly denied the allegations.

However, in December 2003, Rowland abruptly appeared on television and admitted that work had been done by contractors on his cottage at no charge, and that his earlier statements to the contrary were [[perjury|untrue]]. Matters were exacerbated when his wife, Patty Rowland, wrote a satirical poem deriding the media for investigating her husband's admitted wrongdoing.<ref>[http://www.wtnh.com/Global/story.asp?S=1568468 First Lady Patty Rowland's poem] at WTNH.Com Connecticut News.</ref>

He claimed that, since the work was done, he had paid the contractors in full; but in January 2004 an official investigation began into charges of corruption and whether he should face [[impeachment]].

On June 18, the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]] required Rowland to appear before the investigative panel seeking his testimony, which could have resulted in him giving evidence against impeachment in the ongoing criminal investigation. On June 21, Rowland's lawyers announced that he would resign. The [[resignation]] went into effect at noon on July 1, 2004.

On December 23, 2004, Rowland pleaded guilty to [[honest services fraud|depriving the public of honest service]]. Rowland was sentenced on March 18, 2005, in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to one year and one day in prison, four months house arrest, three years [[probation]] and community service. On April 1, 2005, he entered [[Federal Correctional Institution, Loretto]], in [[Pennsylvania]]. His federal inmate number was 15623-014.

==After prison==
On February 10, 2006, Rowland was released from federal prison with the stipulation that he serve four months house arrest with an [[Ankle monitor|electronic ankle bracelet monitor]].

On July 1, 2006, Rowland spoke to an association of scholar athletes in [[Kingston, Rhode Island]], about the lessons he learned.
A "sense of [[entitlement]]" and the "[[Hubris|arrogance of power]]" were two of the biggest things that ended his political career, ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' quoted him as saying.<ref name="HCLESSONS">[http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-rowland0702.artjul02,0,3640450,print.story?coll=hc-headlines-local Rowland Recounts Lessons Learned] [[Hartford Courant]], by Valerie Finholm, Courant staff writer July 2, 2006.</ref>

He warned that the [[Victory disease|arrogance]] is very easy when you're put on a pedestal, and you "start to believe your own press releases. ... It [becomes] all about me. You start to block out what else is around you."<ref name="HCLESSONS"/>

The Courant quoted Rowland as saying that "when you start to find yourself only concerned with yourself" that's the point when you need to find a "grounding force." That should be faith, ideally, he said, or at least "something within yourself"{{spaced ndash}}not just other people.<ref name="HCLESSONS"/>

"I found in my career that a lot of people will tell you how great you are{{spaced ndash}}especially when you're the boss. But there will be that time when that career will be over ... and then it's down to the three F's{{spaced ndash}}faith, family and friends{{spaced ndash}}real faith, real family and real friends."<ref name="HCLESSONS"/>

Rowland, now a resident of West Hartford, told the audience his future is still uncertain. He owes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] more than $35,000 and another $40,000 in fines. He said he's a volunteer counselor and hoping to find a publisher for a book he wrote called ''Falling Into Grace.''<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/rhode_island/articles/2006/07/01/former_conn_governor_makes_his_first_speech_after_prison?mode=PF Former Conn. governor makes his first speech after prison] by Ray Henry, Associated Press Writer, July 1, 2006, accessed from Web site of the Boston Globe on July 2, 2006.</ref>

In September 2006, local TV station [[WTNH]], reported that Patty Rowland had purchased a house in [[Middlebury, Connecticut]], and the Rowland family would be moving to that town.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2006/09/28/rowland_now_a_homeowner_in_middlebury/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+News+%2F+Local Rowland now a homeowner in Middlebury] at Boston.com</ref>

Rowland discussed his life after politics in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' article published June 17, 2007. Rowland discussed his work on the lecture circuit and the factors leading to his political demise. He also expressed disappointment that his successor, Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] had "thrown him under the bus" and distanced herself from him after taking office.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/16/AR2007061601331.html A Look Back, And Up: An Ex-Gov. and Ex-Con Reflects on Three Terms In Office and One in Jail], June 16, 2007, [[Washington Post]].</ref> Rell declined to criticize Rowland over these remarks.<ref>[http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/general_news/rell_on_rowland_and_the_budget.php Rell on Rowland and the Budget], June 18, 2007.</ref>

In January 2008 Waterbury Mayor [[Michael Jarjura]] announced that he would hire Rowland as an economic development advisor for the city.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/news/custom/topnews/hcu-rowlandjob-0122,0,7112712.story Rowland Job]</ref> Rowland began work in February and is receiving an annual salary of $95,000 as the city's economic development coordinator.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/24colct.html For Rowland, Second Chance of a Lifetime], by Woody Hochschwender, ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 2008.</ref>

Since 2010, Rowland has been the host of a conservative talk radio show.<ref>http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/audio-on-demand/wtics-state-and-church/</ref> 

===Further investigations===
Investigations by Connecticut Attorney General [[Richard Blumenthal]] and by a state legislative committee concerning several separate possible improprieties by him and associates, ensued after Rowland's resignation:

* Work he took between his resignation and imprisonment, as a consultant (and possibly an unregistered lobbyist), would clearly have been illegal if the state's [[revolving door|revolving-door]] law explicitly included the governor as it does other state employees. On August 29, 2005, Rowland's attorney Bartley Halloran reported that Chief State's Attorney Christopher Morano would seek a state [[arrest warrant]] against Rowland.<ref>[http://www.wfsb.com/Global/story.asp?S=3780236&nav=1VGmdt26 WFSB News Story]</ref> The prosecutor's request was subsequently denied.

* Three non-profit organizations closely associated with large contributors to his campaigns for public office are also mentioned by investigators:
** Michael Bolton Charities Inc., formerly called the [[Michael Bolton Foundation]] and established by his contributor, the musician [[Michael Bolton]]
** [[National Science Center Foundation]], a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based vendor to the state and one of the controversial consulting clients
** The [[Executive Residence Conservancy]], Inc., which paid for expenses of the governor's mansion during Rowland's residence there
