The '''North Yemen Civil War''' was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'etat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Imam Al-Badr]] and declare Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.

Typical of the [[Arab Cold War]], the royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.

By 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their Vietnam,<ref name=enein>{{Cite news

==Background==
===Yemen===
Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]], who had inherited the Yemeni throne in 1948, was known as "Ahmad the devil" by his enemies.<ref name=afterahmad>{{Cite news

}}</ref> In 1955, [[Iraq]]-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A group of soldiers under his command surrounded the royal palace of [[Al Urdhi]] at [[Taiz]], a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, [[Imam Badr]] succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the King's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then came out of the palace wielding a long scimitar. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a sub-machine gun and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.<ref name=revolt&revenge>{{Cite news

In June 1961, Ahmad was still recovering from an assassination attempt four months earlier, and moved out of the capital, [[Taiz]], into the pleasure palace of [[Sala]]. Already Defense and Foreign Minister, Badr became acting Prime Minister and Interior Minister as well. Despite being Crown Prince, Badr still needed to be picked by the [[Ulema]] in [[San'a]]. Badr was not popular with the Ulema due to his association with Nasser, and the Ulema had refused Ahmad's request to ratify Badr's title.<ref name=wornout>{{Cite news

===Egypt===
[[Image:Yemen-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of Yemen.]]
Nasser had looked to a regime change in Yemen since 1957 and finally put his desires into practice in January 1962 by giving the Free Yemen Movement office space, financial support, and radio air time. [[Anthony Nutting]]'s biography of [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]] identifies several factors that led the Egyptian President to send expeditionary forces to Yemen. These included the unraveling of the union with [[Syria]] in 1961, which dissolved his [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR), damaging his prestige. A quick decisive victory in Yemen could help him recover leadership of the [[Arab world]]. Nasser also had his reputation as an [[anti-colonial]] force, setting his sights on ridding South Yemen and its strategic port city of [[Aden]], of [[United Kingdom|British]] forces.<ref name=enein/>

[[Mohamed Hassanein Heikal|Mohamed Heikal]], a chronicler of Egyptian national policy decision making and confidant of Nasser, wrote in ''For Egypt Not For Nasser'', that he had engaged Nasser on the subject of supporting the coup in Yemen. Heikal argued that Sallal's revolution could not absorb the massive amount of Egyptian forces that would arrive in Yemen to prop up his regime, and that it would be wise to consider sending Arab nationalist volunteers from throughout the Middle East to fight alongside the republican Yemeni forces, suggesting the [[Spanish Civil War]] as a template from which to conduct events in Yemen. Nasser refused Heikal's ideas, insisting on the need to protect the [[Arab nationalist]] movement. Nasser was convinced that a regiment of Egyptian Special Forces and a wing of [[fighter-bomber]]s would be able to secure the Yemeni republican [[coup d'etat]]. Nasser's considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following: (1) Impact of his support to the [[Algerian War of Independence]] from 1954<U+2013>1962; (2) [[Syria]] breaking up from Nasser's [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) in 1961; (3) Taking advantage of a breach in [[United Kingdom|British]] and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser's support for the [[FLN]] in [[Algeria]] and primarily for his efforts to undermine the [[Central Treaty Organization]] (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the [[List of Kings of Iraq|Iraqi monarchy]] in 1958 (4) Confronting [[imperialism]], which Nasser saw as Egypt's destiny; (5) Guaranteeing dominance of the [[Red Sea]] from the [[Suez Canal]] to the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] [[Strait]]; (6) Achieving retribution against the [[Saudi royal family]], whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.<ref name=enein/>

==Coup d'etat==
===Plot===
[[Image:Abdullah Sallal.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Author Dana Adams Schmidt with President Sallal, March 1967.]]
At least four plots were going on in San'a. One was headed by Lieutenant Ali Abdul al Moghny. Another one was conceived by Sallal. His plot merged into a third conspiracy prodded by the Hashid tribal confederation in revenge for Ahmad's execution of their paramount sheik and his son. A fourth plot was shaped by several young princes who sought to get rid of Badr but not the imamate. The only men who knew about those plots were the Egyptian [[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]], Abdul Wahad, and Badr himself. The day after Ahmad's death, Badr's minister in London, Ahmad al Shami, sent him a telegram urging him not to go to San'a to attend his father's funeral because several Egyptian officers, as well as some of his own, were plotting against him. Badr's private secretary did not pass this message to him, pretending he did not understand the code. Badr may have been saved by the gathering of thousands of men at the funeral. Badr learned of the telegram only later.<ref name=schimdt22>Schmidt (1968), p. 22</ref>

A day before the coup Badr was warned by Wahad, who claimed to have information from the Egyptian intelligence service. He warned Badr that Sallal and fifteen other officers, including Moghny, were planning a revolution. Wahad's purpose was to cover himself and Egypt in case the coup failed, to prompt the plotters into immediate action, and drive Sallal and Moghny into a single conspiracy. Sallal got imamic permission to bring in the armed forces. Then, Wahad went to Moghny, and told him that Badr had somehow discovered the plot, and that he must act immediately before the other officers would be arrested. He told him that if he could hold San'a, the radio and the airport for three days, the whole of Europe would recognize him.<ref name=schimdt23>Schmidt (1968), p. 23</ref>

Sallal ordered that the military academy in San'a go on full alert - opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni [[nationalist]] movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence as soon as the shelling of Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (Badr's palace); Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries); The radio station; The telephone exchange; Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory); and The central security headquarters ([[Intelligence (information gathering)|Intelligence]] and Internal Security).<ref name=enein/>

===Execution===
At 10:30 p.m., Badr heard tanks moving through the nearby streets, and reckoned that they were the ones Sallal had asked to move. At 11.45 p.m. the army began shelling the palace. Badr seized a machine gun and began firing at the tanks, although they were out of range. Moghny sent an armored car to Sallal's house and invited him to the headquarters, where he asked him to join the revolution. Sallal agreed, on condition that he would be President. Moghny agreed.<ref name=schimdt29>Schmidt (1968), p. 29</ref> The revolution was carried out with 13 tanks from the Badr Brigade, six armored cars, two mobile artillery cannons, and two anti-air guns. Command and control of the forces loyal to the coup would take place at the Military Academy. A unit of revolutionary officers accompanied by tanks headed towards Al-Bashaer Palace. By microphone, they voiced an appeal to the imamate Guard for tribal solidarity and to surrender Imam Badr, who would be sent peacefully into exile. The imamate Guard refused to surrender and opened fire, prompting the revolutionary leaders to respond with tank and artillery shells. The rebels planned to deploy tanks and artillery in the coup.<ref name=enein/>

The battle at the palace continued until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed. The armory was perhaps the easiest target, as a written order from Sallal was sufficient to open the storage facility, beat the royalists, and secure rifles, artillery and ammunition for the resistance. The telephone exchange likewise fell without any resistance. At the Al-Wusul Palace, revolutionary units remained secure under the guise of granting and protecting diplomats and dignitaries staying there to greet the new Imam of Yemen. By late morning on September 26, all areas of San'a were secure and the radio broadcast that Imam Al-Badr had been overthrown by the new revolutionary government in power. Revolutionary cells in the cities of [[Taiz]], Al-Hujja and the port city of [[Hodeida]] then began securing arsenals, airports and port facilities.<ref name=enein/>

===Aftermath===
[[Image:Yemeni coup.jpg|thumb|left|widthpx|Abdullah Sallal (center) and the heads of the coup in October, 1962.]]
Badr and his personal servants managed to escape through a door in the garden wall in the back of the palace. Because of the curfew declared, they had to avoid the main streets. They decided to escape individually and meet in the village of Gabi al Kaflir, where they were reunited after a forty-five minute walk.<ref name=schimdt30-31>Schmidt (1968), pp. 30&ndash;31</ref> Sallal had to defeat a fellow revolutionary, Al-Baidani, an intellectual holding a doctorate degree, who did not share in Nasser's vision.

Anyone who tries to restore it is an enemy of God and man!"<ref name=arabiafelix/> By then, he had learned that Badr was still alive and had made his way to Saudi Arabia.<ref name=arabiafelix>{{Cite news

Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed was dispatched by plane, and arrived on September 29 to assess the situation and needs of the Yemeni Revolutionary Command Council. Egypt sent a battalion of Special Forces (Saaqah) on a mission to act as personal guards for Sallal. They arrived at Hodeida on October 5.<ref name=enein/> Fifteen days after he had left San'a, Badr sent a man ahead to the Saudi Arabia to announce that he was alive. He then went there himself, crossing the border near [[Khobar]], at the north-western edge of the kingdom.<ref name=schimdt34>Schmidt (1968), p. 34</ref>

==Diplomacy==
[[File:Ian Verner in Yemen.png|thumb|Canadian [[trade commissioner]] [[Ian Verner Macdonald]] poses with rebels]]
[[Saudi Arabia]], fearing [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] encroachment, moved troops along its border with Yemen, as the [[List of kings of Jordan|Jordanian monarch]] dispatched his Army chief of staff for discussions with Badr's uncle, Prince Hassan. Between October 2<U+2013>8 four Saudi cargo planes left Saudi Arabia loaded with arms and military material for Yemeni royalist tribesmen; however, the pilots defected to [[Aswan]]. Ambassadors from [[Bonn]], [[London]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Amman]] supported the Imam while ambassadors from [[Cairo]], [[Rome]] and [[Belgrade]] declared support for the republican revolution.<ref name=enein/> The USSR was the first nation to recognize the new republic, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] cabled Sallal: "Any act of aggression against Yemen will be considered an act of aggression against the Soviet Union."<ref name=afterahmad/>

The United States was concerned that the conflict might spread to other parts of the Middle East. [[US President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] rushed off notes to Nasser, Feisal, Hussein and Sallal. His plan was that Nasser's troops should withdraw from Yemen while Saudi Arabia and Jordan halted their aid to the Imam. Nasser agreed to pull out his forces only after Jordan and Saudi Arabia "stop all aggressive operations on the frontiers".<ref name=diplomacyin/> Feisal and Hussein rejected Kennedy's plan, since it would involve US recognition of the "rebels".<ref name=diplomacyin/> They insisted that the US should withhold recognition of Sallal's Presidency since the Imam might still regain control of Yemen, and that Nasser had no intention of pulling out. The Saudis argued that Nasser wanted their oil fields and was hoping to use Yemen as a springboard for revolt in the rest of the Arabian peninsula.<ref name=diplomacyin>{{Cite news

Sallal declared "I warn America that if it does not recognize the Yemen Arab Republic, I shall not recognize it!".<ref name=paxamericana/> US [[Charg<U+00E9> d'Affaires]] in Taiz, [[Robert Stookey]], reported that the republican regime was in full control of the country, except in some border areas.

A letter written by President Kennedy to Faisal dated October 25, which was kept confidential until January 1963, said: "You may be assured of full US support for the maintenance of Saudi Arabian integrity".<ref name=schimdt185-186>Schmidt (1968), pp. 185&ndash;186</ref> American jet aircraft twice staged shows of force in Saudi Arabia.

Britain, with its commitment to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the [[South Arabian Federation]]. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the [[British Foreign Office]] who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of [[West Germany]], Italy, Canada and Australia, as well as the remaining Arab governments, [[Ethiopia]] and the entire [[communist bloc]].<ref name=schimdt190-191>Schmidt (1968), pp. 190&ndash;191</ref>

A week after the American recognition, Sallal boasted at a military parade the republic had rockets that could strike "the palaces of Saudi Arabia",<ref name=theus/> and in early January the Egyptians again bombed and strafed [[Najran]], a Saudi Arabian city near the Yemenite border. The US responded with another aerial demonstration over Jeddah and a destroyer joined on January 15.

}}</ref> In addition, [[Ralph Bunche]] was sent to Yemen, where he met with Sallal and Egyptian Field Marshall [[Abdel Hakim Amer]]. On March 6 Bunche was in Cairo, where Nasser reportedly assured him that he would withdraw his troops from Yemen if the Saudis would stop supporting the royalists.<ref name=schmidt192-193>Schmidt (1968), pp. 192&ndash;193</ref>

===Operation Hard-surface===
While Bunche was reporting to [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] [[U Thant]], the [[United States Department of State]] sought the help of ambassador [[Ellsworth Bunker]]. His mission was based on a decision made by the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], which was conceived by [[McGeorge Bundy]] and [[Robert Komer]]. The idea behind what became known as "Operation Hard-surface"<ref name=schimdt193/> was to trade American protection (or the appearance of it) for a Saudi commitment to halt aid to the royalists, on the basis of which the Americans would get Nasser to withdraw his troops. The operation would consist of "eight little planes."<ref name=schimdt193>Schmidt (1968), p. 193</ref>

Bunker arrived in Riyadh on March 6. Faisal refused Bunker's offer, which was also hitched to pledges of reform. The original instructions for Operation Hard-surface were that American planes would "attack and destroy"<ref name=schmidt193-194/> any intruders over Saudi air space, but were later changed to read that the Saudis could defend themselves if attacked. Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in [[Beirut]], where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.<ref name=schmidt193-194>Schmidt (1968), pp. 193&ndash;194</ref>

The Bunche and Bunker mission gave birth to the idea of an observer mission to Yemen, which eventually became the [[United Nations Yemen Observation Mission]]. The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN [[Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)|Congo]] commander, [[Sweden|Swedish]] Major General [[Carl Carlsson von Horn|Carl Von Horn]]. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone on both sides of the border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.<ref name=schimdt195>Schmidt (1968), p. 195</ref>

On April 30, Von Horn was sent to discover what kind of force was required. A few days later, he met with Amer in Cairo and found out that Egypt had no intention of drawing all her troops from Yemen. After a few more days, he was told by the Saudi deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Omar Saqqaff]], that the Saudis would not accept any attempt by Egypt to leave security forces after their withdrawal.<ref name=schimdt195/> Saudi Arabia had already been cutting back on its support to the royalists, in part because Egypt's projected plan for unity with [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] made Nasser seem too dangerous. By that time, the war cost Egypt $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000 casualties. Though promising to remove her troops, Egypt had the privilege of leaving an unspecified number for the "training"<ref name=anotherjob/> of Yemen's republican army.<ref name=anotherjob>{{Cite news

==Opposing forces==
===Royalists===
[[Image:Prince Hassan in Wadi Amlah.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Yemeni Prime Minister, Prince Hassan, talking to tribesmen outside his cave in Wadi Amlah, December 1962.]]
Imam Badr led his campaign with the princes of the house of Hamidaddin. Those included Hassan bin Yahya, who had come from New York, Mohamed bin Hussein, Mohamed bin Ismail, Ibrahim al Kipsy, and Abdul Rahman bin Yahya. At fifty-six, Hassan bin Yahya was the oldest and most distinguished. Prince Hassan was made Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The Imam was joined by his childhood pen pal, American [[Bruce Conde]], who set up the post office and would later rise to the rank of general in the Royalist forces.<ref name=schimdt62-63>Schmidt (1968), pp. 62&ndash;63</ref>

In 1963, the Saudis spent $15 million to equip royalist tribes, hire hundreds of European mercenaries, and establish their own radio station. [[Pakistan]], which saw a chance to make money in the conflict, extended rifles to the royalists. Remnants of the Imam's Army also had elements of the [[Saudi National Guard]] fight alongside its ranks. [[Iran]] subsidized royalist forces on and off, as the [[Shah]] felt compelled to provide Badr (a [[Shiite]] [[Zeidi]]) with financing. The [[United Kingdom|British]] allowed convoys of arms to flow through one of its allies in Northern Yemen, the Sheriff of [[Beijan]], who was protected by the British administration in [[Aden]]. [[British military]] planes conduced night operations to resupply Badr's forces.<ref name=enein/> The [[MI6]] was responsible for contacting the royalists, and used the services of a private company belonging to Colonel [[David Stirling]], founder of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS), who recruited dozens of former SAS men as advisors to the royalists.<ref name=melman>{{Cite news

The [[Lyndon Johnson]] administration was more willing than Kennedy's to support long-range plans in support of the Saudi army. In 1965, the US authorized an agreement with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] to supervise the construction of military facilities and in 1966 it sponsored a $100 million program which provided the Saudi forces with combat vehicles, mostly trucks. Faisal also initiated an Islamic alignment called the Islamic Conference, to counter Nasser's [[Arab socialism]].<ref name=safran119>Safran (1988), p. 119</ref>

The tribes of Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked, and the Saudis enticed thousands of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia to assist the royalist cause. In addition to the Saudis and British, the Iraqis also sent plane loads of [[Baathist]] Yemenis to undermine Sallal's regime.<ref name=enein/> The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father's unpopularity. One sheik said "The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years. Some were good and some bad. We killed the bad ones sooner or later, and we prospered under the good ones". The hill tribes were Shia, like the Imam, while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni, as were most Egyptians. President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis. Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser's biggest target, saying "Now I'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser. We were brothers, but when I refused to become his stooge, he used Sallal against me. I will never stop fighting. I will never go into exile. Win or lose, my grave will be here".<ref name=forallah>{{Cite news

Badr had formed two royalist armies - one under his uncle Prince Hassan in the east and one under his own control in the west. Both armies controlled most of the north and east of Yemen, including the towns of [[Harib]] and [[Marib]]. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, [[Sadah]], which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital [[San'a]], was controlled by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of [[Hajjah]], where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress. [[Mercenaries]] from France, [[Belgium]] and England, who had fought in [[Rhodesia]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]], were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of [[Anti-tank warfare|antitank weapons]], such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to [[guerilla warfare]], isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.<ref name=enein/>

Three decades after the war, former [[Mossad]] director, [[Shabtai Shavit]], and [[Ariel Sharon]] both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen. Some of the royalist air drops were aided by the [[Israeli Air Force]] (IAF). The aircraft were contracted privately to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops.<ref name=jones136>Jones (2004), p. 136</ref> 

According to "Haaretz" newspaper, one of the SAS advisers, Tony Boyle, contacted David Karon, the head of the Middle East department in the Tevel (Cosmos) section of the Mossad, and met with IAF commander [[Ezer Weizman]] and his officers. It was decided that the airdrops would be made.<ref name=melman/> The Israeli aircraft flew along the Saudi coastline. The Saudis did not have radar systems, and would later claim they were not aware of the airlifts. The Israeli planes would make the drops and then refuel in [[French Somaliland]] (now [[Djibouti]]) and return to Israel.<ref name=stern>{{Cite news

The IAF's largest transport plane, the Stratofreighter, was recruited for the operation. The first flight took off in March 1964 from [[Tel Nof Airbase]]. During the sixth flight, Boyle suggested that the IAF would also bomb Sanaa. Weizman supported the idea and plans were made, but the [[Israel Defense Forces]] Chief of Staff ([[Ramatkal]]) [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Israeli Prime Minister]], [[Levi Eshkol]], denied him. The operation went on over a period of slightly more than two years, during which the Stratofreighter carried out 14 nighttime sorties from Tel Nof to Yemen.<ref name=melman/> The Mossad also operated several agents in Yemen. One of them, Baruch Mizrahi, was caught in 1967 and was imprisoned in Egypt. He was released in a prisoner exchange between Egypt and Israel following the [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref name=stern/>

[[Anwar Sadat]] was convinced that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. [[Ahmed Abu-Zeid]], who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in [[Cairo]], including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and had no sense of loyalty or [[nationhood]]. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.<ref name=enein/>

All the Egyptian field commanders complained of a total lack of [[topographical map]]s causing a real problem in the first months of the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, [[Salah Nasr]], admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an [[economic]] report on the country.<ref name=enein/>
[[Image:Egyptian instructing.jpg|thumb|widthpx|right|An Egyptian instructor at the San'a military academy showing a Yemeni how to use a bayonet affixed to a [[Mosin-Nagant]] rifle.]]
In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians had five squadrons of aircraft in Yemen at airfields near San'a and [[Hodeida]]. They were using [[Yakovlev Yak-11|Yak-11]] piston-engined fighters, [[MiG-15]] and [[MiG-17]] jet fighters, [[Ilyushin Il-28]] twin-engined bombers, [[Ilyushin Il-14]] twin-engined transports and [[Mil Mi-4]] transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined [[Tupolev]] bombers from bases in Egypt, such as [[Aswan]]. All the air crew were Egyptian, except for the Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews.<ref name=schimdt168-169>Schmidt (1968), pp. 168&ndash;169</ref> Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on [[airlift]]. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian [[Antonov]] heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, [[Moscow]] refurbished the [[Al-Rawda]] Airfield outside San'a. The [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|politburo]] saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.<ref name=enein/>

Egyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of [[Najran]] and the coastal town of [[Jizan]], which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased a British [[English Electric Thunderbird|Thunderbird air defense system]] and developed their airfield in [[Khamis Mushayt]]. [[Riyadh]] also attempted to convince [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] to respond on its behalf. [[John F.Kennedy|President Kennedy]] sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to [[Dhahran]] Airbase, demonstrating to Nasser the seriousness of American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.<ref name=enein/>

==Egyptian offensives==
[[Image:Yemencivilwar.png|thumb|widthpx|left|The Ramadan (straight) and Haradh (dotted) offensives.]]
The Egyptian [[General Staff]] divided the Yemen War into three operational objectives. The first was the air phase, it began with jet trainers modified to strafe and carry bombs and ended with three wings of fighter-bombers, stationed near the Saudi-Yemeni border. Egyptian sorties went along the [[Tiahma]] Coast of Yemen and into the Saudi towns of [[Najran]] and [[Jizan]]. It was designed to attack royalist ground formations and substitute the lack of Egyptian formations on the ground with high-tech air power. In combination with Egyptian air strikes, a second operational phase involved securing major routes leading to San'a, and from there secure key towns and hamlets. The largest offensive based on this operational tactic was the March 1963 "[[Ramadan]] Offensive" that lasted until February 1964, focused on opening and securing roads from San'a to [[Sadah]] to the North, and San'a to [[Marib]] to the East. The success of the Egyptian forces meant that royalist resistance could take refuge in hills and mountains to regroup and carry out hit-and-run offensives against republican and Egyptian units controlling towns and roads. The third strategic offensive was the pacification of tribes and their enticement to the republican government, meaning the expenditures of massive amounts of funds for humanitarian needs and outright bribery of tribal leaders.<ref name=enein/>

===Ramadan offensive===
[[Image:Republican helicopter.jpg|thumb|widthpx|A republican helicopter, captured early in the war by the royalists outside Marib.]]
The Ramadan offensive began in February 1963 when Amer and Sadat arrived in San'a. Amer asked Cairo to double the 20,000 men in Yemen, and in early February the first 5,000 of the reinforcement arrived. On February 18 a task force of fifteen tanks, twenty armored cars, eighteen trucks and numerous jeeps took off from San'a' moving northwards, heading for Sadah. More garrison troops followed. A few days later another task force, spearheaded by 350 men in tanks and armored cars, struck out from Sadah southeastwards toward Marib. The maneuvered into the [[Rub al-Khali]] desert, perhaps well into Saudi territory, and there they were built up by an airlift. Then they headed westwards. On February 25 they occupied Marib and on March 7 they took Harib. A royalist force of 1,500 men ordered down from Najran failed to stop them on their way out from Sadah. The royalist commander at Harib fled to [[Beihan]], on the British-protected side of the border.<ref name=schimdt164-165>Schmidt (1968), pp. 164&ndash;165</ref> In the battle of [[El Argoup]], 25  miles southeast of San'a, 500 royalists under Prince  Abdullah's commanded  attacked an Egyptian position on top of a sheer-sided hill  that was fortified with six Soviet [[T-54 tank]]s, a dozen armored cars  and entrenched machine guns. The royalists advanced in a thin skirmish  line and were plastered by artillery, mortars and strafing planes. They replied with rifles, one mortar with 20 rounds, and a bazooka  with four rounds. The battle lasted a week and cost the Egyptians three tanks, seven armored cars and 160 dead.<ref name=forallah/> The Egyptians were now in positions from which they could hope to interdict the royalist movement of supplies in the mountains north and east of San'a'.<ref name=schimdt164-165/>

In the beginning of April the royalists held a conference with Faisal in Riyadh. They decided to adopt new tactics, including attempts to get supplies around the positions now held by the Egyptians by using camels instead of trucks to cross the mountains to reach the positions east of San'a. Camel caravans from Beihan would swing into the Rub al-Khali and enter Yemen north of Marib. It was also decided that the royalists must now strengthen their operations west of the mountains with three "armies". By the end of April, they began to recover and claimed to have regained some of the positions the Egyptians had taken in the Jawf, particularly the small but strategic towns of [[Barat]] and [[Safra]], both in the mountains between Sadah and the Jawf, and were able to move freely in the eastern [[Khabt]] desert. In the Jawf they claimed to have cleaned up all Egyptian strong-points except [[Hazm]], and in the west the town of [[Batanah]].<ref name=schimdt169-170>Schmidt (1968), pp. 169&ndash;170</ref>

===Haradh offensive===
On June 12, Egyptian infantry numbering at about 4,000, reinforced by the republican army and mercenaries from the Aden protectorate invaded the town of [[Beit Adaqah]], about thirty miles west of San'a, where Prince Abdullah held a front extending from the Hodeida road, through [[Kawakaban]] province, to southern [[Hajjah]]. In two days, the attackers advanced about twelve miles, before being repelled by a counter-attack. The royalists admitted about 250 casualties. Next, the Egyptians attacked Sudah, about 100 miles north-west of San'a. They used the unpopularity of the local royalist commander to bribe several local sheiks and occupied the town unopposed. After a month, the sheiks sent delegations to Badr soliciting pardons and asking for guns and money with which to fight the Egyptians. Badr sent new forces and managed to regain the surroundings of Sudah, though not the town itself.<ref name=schimdt178-179>Schmidt (1968), pp. 178&ndash;179</ref>
[[Image:Royalists on armored car.jpg|thumb|left|widthpx|A Soviet-manufactured armored car, captured by royalist guerrillas from the Egyptians near Haradh.]]
On August 15, the Egyptians launched an offensive from their major north-western base in Haradh. They had 1,000 troops and about 2,000 republicans. The plan, as interpreted by British intelligence, seemed to have been to cut the thirty-mile track southward through the mountains from the Saudi border at [[Khoubah]] to Badr's headquarters in the [[Qara mountains]] near [[Washa]], and then to split into two task forces, one moving east through Washa to the headquarters and the other north-eastwards along the track to the Saudi border below the [[Razih]] mountains. The Egyptians began their move on Saturday morning, moving along the Haradh and [[Tashar]] ravines. On Saturday and Sunday afteroons they were caught in heavy rain and their vehicles, including twenty tanks and about forty armored cars sank axle deep into the mud. The defenders left them alone until Monday at dawn. Badr left his headquarters at three that morning with 1,000 men to direct a counter attack in the Tashar ravine, while Abdullah Hussein attacked in the Haradh ravine.<ref name=schimdt179-180>Schmidt (1968), pp. 179&ndash;180</ref>

Meanwhile, the Egyptians had planned a coordinated drive from Sadah to the southwest, below the Razih mountains, hoping to link up with the force coming from Haradh. They were counting on a local sheik, whose forces were to supposed to join 250 Egyptian parachutists. The sheik failed to deliver, and the parachutists made their way back to Sadah, suffering losses from snipers on the way. Badr had sent radio messages and summonses by runner in all directions calling for reinforcement. He asked reserve forces training in the Jawf to arrive in trucks mounting 55- and 57-millimeter cannon and 81 millimeter mortars and heavy machine guns. They arrived within forty-eight hours, in time to face the attackers. They outflanked the Egyptian columns, still stuck in mud in the ravines. They later announced they had knocked out ten of the Egyptian tanks and about half of their armored cars, and claimed to have shot down an Ilyushin bomber.<ref name=schimdt180>Schmidt (1968), p. 180</ref> The royalists also carried out two supporting movements. One was a raid on [[Jihana]], in which several staff officers were killed. The second was an attempt, involving British advisors and French and Belgian mercenaries from [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], to bombard San'a from a nearby mountain peak. Other diversionary operations included raids on Egyptian aircraft and tanks at the south airport of San'a and a mortar at the Egyptian and republican residence in a suburb of Taiz.<ref name=schimdt180-182>Schmidt (1968), pp. 180&ndash;182</ref> Although the Egyptians managed to drive Badr out of his headquarters to a cave on Jabal Shedah, they could not close the Saudi border. They declared victory on the radio and on the press, but were obliged to agree to a ceasefire on the upcoming Erkwit conference on November 2.<ref name=schimdt182>Schmidt (1968), p. 182</ref>

==Alexandria summit and Erkwit ceasefire==
In September, 1964, Nasser and Faisal met in the Arab summit in [[Alexandria]]. By that time Egypt had 40,000 troops in Yemen and had suffered an estimated 10,000 casualties. In their official communiqu<U+00E9> the two leaders promised to 1) cooperate fully to solve the existing differences between the various factions in Yemen, 2) work together in preventing armed clashes in Yemen, and 3) reach a solution by peaceful agreement. The communiqu<U+00E9> was widely hailed in the Arab world, and Washington called it a "statesmanlike action" and a "major step toward eventual peaceful settlement of the long civil war." Nasser and Faisal warmly embraced at Alexandria's airport and called each other "brother".

On November 2, at a secret conference in [[Erkwit]], [[Sudan]], the royalists and republicans declared a ceasefire effective at 1:00 PM on Monday, November 8. Tribesmen of both sides celebrated the decision until that day, and for two days after it went into effect, they fraternized at several places.<ref name=schimdt207>Schmidt (1968), p. 207</ref> On November 2 and 3, nine royalists and nine republicans, with a Saudi and an Egyptian observer, worked out the terms. A conference of 168 tribal leaders was planned for November 23. For the royalists, the conference was to become an embryo national assembly that would name a provisional national executive of two royalists, two republicans and one neutral, to administer the country provisionally and to plan a plebiscite. Until that plebiscite, which would decide whether Yemen would be a monarchy or a republic, both Sallal and Badr were to step aside.<ref name=schimdt208-209>Schmidt (1968), pp. 208&ndash;209</ref> At the end of the two days the Egyptians resumed their bombing of royalist positions. The conference planned for November 23 was postponed to the 30th, then indefinitely. The republicans blamed the royalists for not arriving, while the royalists blamed the Egyptian bombings.<ref name=schimdt209>Schmidt (1968), p. 209</ref>

==Royalist offensive==
[[Image:Royalist camp.jpg|thumb|widthpx|The camp used by royalist forces at Hanjar, in north-eastern Yemen.]]
Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian attempts to drive directly into the Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and it was estimated that the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive.<ref name=schimdt214>Schmidt (1968), p. 214</ref> The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to [[Amran]], then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.<ref name=schimdt221-222>Schmidt (1968), pp. 221&ndash;222</ref>

The royalists under the command of Prince Mohamed's objective was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack with the help of the Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-Millimeter guns and mortars overlooking the Wadi.<ref name=schimdt222>Schmidt (1968), p. 222</ref> On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm came out from behind the rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.<ref name=schimdt222/>

Meanwhile, Prince Abdullah bin Hassan began to raid Egyptian positions north-east of San'a at Urush, Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was attacking the Egyptians with 500 men west of Humaidat, Prince Hassan struck out from near Sadah and Prince Hassan bin Hussein moved from Jumaat, west of Sadah, to within mortar-firing distance of the Egyptian airfield west of Sadah. Fifty Egyptians surrendered at Mutanah, near Humaidat. They were eventually allowed to evacuate to San'a with their arms. Mohamed's policy was to keep officers as prisoners for exchange, and to allow soldiers to go in return for their arms. Three to five thousand Egyptian troops in garrisons on the eastern slopes of the mountains and in the desert now had to be supplied entirely by air.<ref name=schimdt222-223>Schmidt (1968), pp. 222&ndash;223</ref>

==Stalemate==
[[Image:Marib bomb damage.jpg|thumb|widthpx|left|Egyptian bomb damage in a village near Marib.]]
The royalist radio tried to widen the split in republican ranks by promising amnesty to all non-royalists once the Egyptians were withdrawn. Badr also promised a new form of government: "a constitutionally democratic system" ruled by a "national assembly elected by the people of Yemen". At Sallal's request, Nasser provided him with ammunition and troop reinforcements by transport plane from Cairo.<ref name=backto>{{Cite news

There were also five or six times as many armed royal tribesmen, and the regular force under Prince Mohamed. In early June they moved into Sirwah in eastern Yemen.

Noman was considered a moderate who believed in compromise. He had resigned as president of the republican Consultative Council in December in protest against Sallal's "failure to fulfill the people's aspirations". Noman's first act was to name a new 15-man Cabinet, maintaining an even balance between Yemen's two main tribal groupings, the mountain Zeidis, who are mostly royalist, and the Shafis, who are mostly republican.<ref name=aman>{{Cite news

Noman spoke over Radio San'a, offering reconciliation and inviting "all tribes of all persuasions" to meet with him the following week at Khamir, 50 miles north of San'a, to achieve "the one thing which we all prize over anything else: peace for the nation." In order to convince Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a.<ref name=aman/> Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the "beguiled brothers", Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the "dawn of a new era." Sallal called the talks "a complete success", while Badr stated that "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves."<ref name=appointmentin>{{Cite news

Noman resigned, saying "It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies are more interested in war than  peace".

On November 23, the two sides met in Haradh. The first issue was the name of the transition state that was supposed to exist until a plebiscite could be held the following year. The royalists wanted the name "Kingdom of Yemen"  but were willing to settle for a neutral title like "State of Yemen". The republicans insisted on having the word "republic" or "republican" in the title.

==Nasser's "long-breath" strategy==
Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3 billion, and the gap between exports and imports had widened to a record $500 million for 1965. On Victory Day in [[Port Said]], Nasser conceded that "We are facing difficulties. We must all work harder  and make sacrifices. I have no magic button that I can push to produce the things you want". Premier [[Zakaria Mohieddin]] raised Egypt's income tax, added a "defense tax" on all sales, and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports. He also hiked the cost of luxury goods 25% and set low price ceilings on most foodstuffs. He sent 400 plainclothesmen to Cairo's to arrest 150 shopkeepers for price violations.<ref name=fewercurses>{{Cite news

In a speech on [[May Day]], 1966, Nasser said the war was entering a new phase. He launched what he called a "long-breath strategy." The plan was to pare the army from 70,000 men to 40,000, withdraw from exposed positions in eastern and northern Yemen, and tighten the hold on particular parts of Yemen: the Red Sea coastline; a northern boundary that takes in the well-fortified town of Hajja and San'a; and the border with the South Arabian Federation, which was to become independent in 1968. Nasser insisted that attacks on Najran, Qizan and other "bases of aggression" would continue, arguing that "these were originally Yemeni towns, which the Saudis usurped in 1930".<ref name=longbreath>{{Cite news

The Russians were also willing to aid Nasser with arms and  equipment in Yemen, but feared that a widening of the conflict  to Saudi Arabia would lead to a "hot war" confrontation in the  Middle East.

Sallal arrested about 140 suspects, including Mohamed Ruwainy, the ex-Minister for Tribal Affairs, and Colonel Hadi Issa, former deputy chief of staff of the armed forces. Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a "subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic" and planning a campaign of assassination, financed by Saudi Arabia, Britain, Israel and the US.

The first use of [[Chemical warfare|gas]] took place on June 8, 1963 against Kawma, a village of about 100 inhabitants in northern Yemen, killing about seven people and damaging the eyes and lungs of twenty-five others.<ref name=schimdt257>Schmidt (1968), p. 257</ref> This incident is considered to have been experimental, and the bombs were described as "home-made, amateurish and relatively ineffective". The Egyptian authorities suggested that the reported incidents were probably caused by [[napalm]], not gas. The [[Israeli Foreign Minister]], [[Golda Meir]], suggested in an interview that Nasser would not hesitate to use gas against Israel as well.<ref name=schimdt259>Schmidt (1968), p. 259</ref> There were no reports of gas during 1964, and only a few were reported in 1965. The reports grew more frequent in late 1966. On December 11, 1966, fifteen gas bombs killed two people and injured thirty-five. On January 5, 1967, the biggest gas attack came against the village of Kitaf, causing 270 casualties, including 140 fatalities.<ref name=nti>{{Cite web

==Siege of San'a==
[[Image:Prince Mohamed bin Hussein.jpg|thumb|widthpx|Prince Mohamed bin Hussein, deputy to Imam Badr, in command of the royalist forces besieging San'a, December 1967.]]
On November 5, Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen called down to San'a, moved four tanks into the city's dusty squares, took over the Presidential Palace and announced over the government radio station that Sallal had been removed "from all positions of authority". The coup went unopposed. In Baghdad, Sallal asked for political asylum, saying "every revolutionary must anticipate obstacles and difficult situations".<ref name=whenfriends/> The Iraqi government offered him a home and a monthly grant of 500 dinars.<ref name=schimdt293>Schmidt (1968), p. 293</ref>

The new republican government was headed by Qadi [[Abdul Rahman Iryani]], Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful of his colleagues reluctance to negotiate with the Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri.<ref name=schimdt294>Schmidt (1968), p. 294</ref> Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs "We have money, and you will have your share if you join us. If not, we will go on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as "the Fighting Rifles" surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists.

Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.<ref name=thesiege/>

The republicans boasted a new air force, while the royalists claimed to have shot down a MiG-17 fighter with a Russian pilot. The [[US State Department]] said that this claim, as well as reports of twenty-four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen, were correct. In January, the republicans were defending San'a with about 2,000 regulars and tribesmen, plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks. They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed a crash course in the Soviet Union. The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside. Between 4,000 and 5,000 royalists suffered from republican air power, but had the advantage of high ground. However, they did not have enough ammunition, as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December.<ref name=schimdt296-297>Schmidt (1968), pp. 296&ndash;297</ref>
