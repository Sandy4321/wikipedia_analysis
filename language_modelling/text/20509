==Early career==

Grote was raised in San Antonio where he attended [[Douglas MacArthur High School (San Antonio, Texas)|Douglas MacArthur High School]].<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/> In [[1962 Houston Colt .45s season|1962]], he was drafted from [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] as an amateur [[free agent]] by the Houston Colt .45s, who later became the [[Houston Astros]].<ref name="Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions at The Baseball Almanac">[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=groteje01 Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions at The Baseball Almanac]</ref><ref name="Jerry Grote at Centerfield Maz">[http://www.centerfieldmaz.com/2009/10/former-met-of-day-jerry-grote-1966-1977.html Jerry Grote at Centerfield Maz]</ref>  

==Major League Baseball career==

By [[1964 Houston Colt .45s season|1964]], Grote had become the starting catcher for the Colt .45s. He was the Colt .45 catcher on April 23, {{By|1964}} when [[Ken Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Ken Johnson]] became the first [[pitcher]] in major league history to lose a [[complete game]] [[no-hitter]] in nine [[inning]]s when he was beaten 1-0 by the [[1964 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU196404230.shtml April 23, 1964 Reds-Colt .45 box score at Baseball Reference]</ref> Cincinnati's [[Pete Rose]] scored the only [[Run (baseball)|run]] of the game in the ninth inning, when he reached second base on an [[Error (baseball)|error]] and later scored. After two seasons with the Colts, Grote was traded to the New York Mets for [[pitcher]] [[Tom Parsons (baseball)|Tom Parsons]] in October [[1965 Houston Astros season|1965]].<ref name="Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions at The Baseball Almanac"/> Grote was sent back to the [[Minor league baseball|minor leagues]] in {{By|1965}}, before becoming the starting catcher for the Mets from [[1966 New York Mets season|1966]] to [[1976 New York Mets season|1976]].<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=grote-001ger Jerry Grote minor league baseball statistics at Baseball Reference]</ref> By [[1968 New York Mets season|1968]], Grote was recognized as one of the top catchers in the [[National League]] and was selected to be the starting catcher in the [[1968 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1968]] [[All-Star Game]], which was held at the [[Houston Astrodome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/history/all_stars.jsp|title=Mets All-stars|accessdate=2009-03-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS196807090.shtml 1969 All-Star game at Baseball Reference]</ref> 

During the [[Miracle Mets#1969: The Miracle Mets|1969 ''Miracle Mets'']] season, he was considered one of the most valuable players on the team because of his work in handling the pitching staff and for his defensive skills.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=KDMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=baseball+digest+jerry+grote#v=onepage&q=baseball%20digest%20jerry%20grote&f=false ''Jerry Grote: Mets Most Valuable?'', Baseball Digest, Feb 1970, Vol. 29, No. 2, ISSN 0005-609X]</ref> Prior to the [[1969 New York Mets season|1969]] season, the Mets had been perennial losers, never finishing higher than ninth place in the National League.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/New_York_Mets The New York Mets at Baseball Reference]</ref> The [[1969 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], had been in first place in the [[National League East]] for 156 days of the season, and seemed likely to win the division, when they slumped to a 9-17 record in their final 25 games, while the Mets went 37-11 in their final 48 games and clinched the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1969-standings.shtml 1969 National League East standings at Baseball Reference]</ref><ref name="''Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July''">[http://books.google.com/books?id=ACwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=baseball+digest+miracle+mets#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July'', Baseball Digest, July 1996, Vol. 55, No. 7, ISSN 0005-609X]</ref> The Mets went on to sweep the [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1969 National League Championship Series]], and then [[upset]] the favored [[1969 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] to win the [[1969 World Series|World Series]], four games to one.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1969_WS.shtml 1969 World Series at Baseball Reference]</ref>

Grote's catching and pitch calling skills also played a valuable role for the [[1973 New York Mets season|1973 New York Mets]], when they went from last place on August 30th to win the [[National League Eastern Division]] pennant, and defeated the heavily-favored [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]].<ref name="''Pennant Races Don't Really Begin Until Month of July''"/><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/1973.shtml 1973 New York Mets Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics at Baseball Reference]</ref><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1973_NLCS.shtml 1973 National League Championship Series at Baseball Reference]</ref> In the [[1973 World Series|World Series]], the Mets took the [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to the seventh and final game, before they were defeated.<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1973_WS.shtml 1973 World Series at Baseball Reference]</ref> Grote caught every [[inning]] of every post-season game for the Mets in 1969 and 1973.<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/><ref name="Jerry Grote at Centerfield Maz"/>

By the [[1977 New York Mets season|1977]] season, [[John Stearns]] had taken over as the Mets' starting catcher, and in August, after twelve seasons with the Mets, Grote was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers.<ref name="Jerry Grote Trades and Transactions at The Baseball Almanac"/> During his two seasons with the Dodgers, he played part time as a back up to [[Steve Yeager]], and appeared in two World Series against the [[New York Yankees]].<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/> He quit professional baseball after the [[1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1978]] season, only to be lured out of retirement in [[1981 Kansas City Royals season|1981]] by the Kansas City Royals who were experiencing a shortage of catchers.<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/> After another short stint with the Dodgers, he retired for good after the 1981 season.<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/>
 
Grote called the pitches for some of the most outstanding pitchers of his era, including [[Tom Seaver]], [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Tommy John]], [[Jerry Koosman]], [[Tug McGraw]], [[Mickey Lolich]] and [[Jon Matlack]].<ref name="''Jerry Grote: He Caught Some of the Greats in his Career''"/> He possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm against opposing [[baserunner]]s. Hall of Fame inductee [[Lou Brock]] found Grote to be one of the most difficult catchers on which to attempt a [[stolen base]].<ref name="''Jerry Grote: He Caught Some of the Greats in his Career''"/> [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] catcher [[Johnny Bench]] once said of Grote, "If Grote and I were on the same team, I would be playing [[third base]]."<ref name="Jerry Grote at Centerfield Maz"/><ref>[http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/mets/grote_survived_storm_long_before_8xp7Xfg4uA1M1b0IqIOPVP Jerry Grote at The New York Post]</ref>

Grote was acknowledged to be highly competitive by his teammates and opponents. One of his trademarks was seen whenever his pitcher ended an inning with a [[strikeout]], whereupon, while leaving the field, Grote would roll the ball to the far side of the [[pitcher's mound]] (closest to the Mets' dugout). This necessitated the opposing team's pitcher having to walk further to stoop and retrieve the ball, thus adding insult to injury. Over his career, he played in 1421 [[Games played|games]], had a .252 [[batting average]] with 39 [[home runs]], 404 [[Runs batted in|RBIs]], 1092 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] and a .991 [[fielding percentage]].<ref name="Jerry Grote at Baseball Reference"/> At the time of his retirement in 1981, his .991 career fielding percentage was 8th highest all-time among catchers.

==Post retirement and honors==

After his playing career had ended, Grote spent 1985 as [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[Lakeland Tigers]] and the [[Birmingham Barons]].<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=22377 1985 Lakeland Tigers at Baseball Reference]</ref><ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=12332 1985 Birmingham Barons at Baseball Reference]</ref> In 1989, he played for the [[St. Lucie Legends]] in the [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]]. Grote appeared as a [[List of What's My Line? mystery guests|Mystery Guest]] on the [[television]] [[game show]] ''[[What's My Line?]]''.<ref>*{{cite book | first=Gil | last=Fates | year= 1978 | title= What's My Line?
