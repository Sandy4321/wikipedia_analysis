A '''nativity scene''' is a depiction of the [[nativity of Jesus|birth of Jesus]] as described in the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]].  While the term "nativity scene" typically includes two dimensional depictions in [[film]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], and other [[Media (arts)|media]], the term popularly refers to static, [[three dimension]]al, [[mass production|commercial]] or [[folk art]] [[dioramas]], or [[pantomime]]s called "living nativity scenes" in which real  humans and animals participate.  Nativity scenes exhibit (at the minimum) figures representing the infant [[Jesus]], his mother [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], and Mary's husband, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]].  Some nativity scenes include other characters from the [[Bible|Biblical]] story such as [[shepherd]]s, the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and [[angel]]s.  The figures are usually displayed in a [[stable]], [[cave]], or other structure.

[[Saint Francis of Assisi]] is credited with creating the first nativity scene in 1223 (a "living" one) intending thereby to cultivate the worship of Christ. The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout [[Christendom]] to stage similar pantomimes and eventually to create elaborate and ever more elaborate static exhibitions with [[wax]] and [[ivory]] figurines garbed in rich fabrics set against intricate [[landscape]]s.  

[[File:Szopka 2008 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Szopka'', 2008]]

Distinctive nativity scenes and traditions have been created around the world and are displayed during the Christmas season in [[church]]es, homes, [[shopping mall]]s, and other venues, and occasionally on public lands and in public buildings.   The Vatican has displayed a scene in [[St. Peter's Square]] near its Christmas tree since 1982 and the [[Pope]] has for many years blessed the mangers of children assembled in St. Peter's Square for a special ceremony.   The [[White House]] exhibits an eighteenth century [[Italy|Italian]] ''[[presepio]]'' during the Christmas season. [[Folk art]] traditions in [[Europe]] include the hand-painted ''[[santons]]'' of [[France]] and the colorful ''[[szopka]]'' of [[Poland]]. 

Public nativity scenes have not escaped controversy nor vandalism. Erections in public buildings or on public lands have sparked lawsuits in the [[United States of America|United States]], and a life-sized scene in the [[United Kingdom]] featuring waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) notes animal abuse connected with living nativity displays. A city council in Spain provoked protest when it forbade a traditional character in a public nativity scene, and, across America, the theft of ceramic or plastic nativity figurines from outdoor displays is not an infrequent occurrence during the Christmas season.

==Birth of Jesus==
A nativity scene takes its inspiration from the accounts of the birth of Jesus in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke.<ref>Brown, Raymond E.. ''The Birth of the Messiah''. Doubleday, 1997.</ref><ref>Vermes, Geza. ''The Nativity: History and Legend''. Penguin, 2006</ref>  Luke's narrative describes an angel announcing the birth of Jesus to shepherds who then visit the humble site where Jesus is found in a manger. Matthew's narrative tells of Magi who follow a star to the place where Jesus dwells, and indicates that the Magi found Jesus around two years after his birth rather than on the exact day.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=2&version=50 Matt. 2:7&ndash;8, 16 Bible Gateway].Retrieved January 13, 2009.</ref>  Matthew's account does not mention the angels and shepherds, while Luke's narrative is silent on the Magi and the star.   With no basis in scripture, however, three dimensional nativity scenes (whether static or living) usually bring the shepherds and the angels of Luke together at the manger with Matthew's Magi and the star. Further, and without scriptural basis, the ox and the ass are present at the manger as well as other animals such as sheep, goats, and camels.

==Origins and early history==
[[File:Giotto - Legend of St Francis - -13- - Institution of the Crib at Greccio.jpg|thumb|St. Francis at Greccio by [[Giotto]]]] 

St. Francis of Assisi is credited with creating the first nativity scene<ref name="Dues" /><ref name="Thomas">Thomas, George F.. ''Vitality of the Christian Tradition''. Ayer Co. Publishing, 1944.</ref> in 1223 at Greccio, Italy,<ref name="Dues" /><ref name="Johnson">Johnson, Kevin Orlin. ''Why Do Catholics Do That?'' Random House, Inc., 1994.</ref> in an attempt to place the emphasis of Christmas upon the worship of Christ rather than upon [[secular]] [[materialism]] and gift giving.<ref name="Mazar">Mazar, Peter and Evelyn Grala.

''All Around the Year: Holidays and Celebrations in American Life''. University of Illinois Press, 1995. ISBN 0252065166.</ref> [[Pope Honorius III]] gave his blessing to the exhibit.<ref name="Italy" /> Such pantomimes became hugely popular and spread throughout Christendom.<ref name="Santino" /> Within a hundred years every church in Italy was expected to have a nativity scene at Christmastime.<ref name="Johnson" /> Eventually, statues replaced human and animal participants, and static scenes grew to elaborate affairs with richly robed figurines placed in intricate landscape settings.<ref name="Santino" /> Charles III, King of the Two Sicilies, collected such elaborate scenes, and his enthusiasm encouraged others to do the same.<ref name="Johnson" />

A tradition in [[England]], [[United Kingdom]] involved baking a [[mince pie]] in the shape of a [[manger]] to hold the [[Christ child]] until dinnertime when the pie was eaten.  When the [[Puritan]]s banned Christmas celebrations in the seventeenth century, they also passed specific legislation to outlaw such pies, calling them "Idolaterie in crust".<ref name="Johnson" />

==Components==
===Static nativity scenes===
[[File:Rubber Duck Nativity.jpg|thumb|Whimsical [[rubber ducky]] set featuring the Magi, a lamb, and the Holy Family]]
A static nativity scene is erected in homes and churches during the Christmas season, and is composed of figurines depicting the infant Jesus resting in a manger, Mary, and Joseph.  Other figures in the scene may include [[angel]]s, [[shepherd]]s, and animals. The figures may be made of any material,<ref name="Dues">Dues, Greg.''Catholic Customs and Traditions: A Popular Guide'' Twenty-Third Publications, 2000.</ref> and arranged in a stable or cave.  The [[Magi]] may also appear, and are sometimes not placed in the scene until the week following Christmas to account for their travel time to the event.<ref name="Tangerman" /> After [[WWI]], large, lighted manger scenes in churches and public buildings grew in popularity, and, by the 1950s, many companies were selling [[lawn ornament]]s of non-fading, long-lasting, weather resistant materials telling the nativity story.<ref name="Collins" /> While most home nativity scenes are packed away at Christmas or shortly thereafter, nativity scenes in churches usually remain on display until the feast of the [[Baptism of the Lord]].<ref name="Dues" />

Variants on the standard nativity scene are many and include ethnic dioramas. In [[Colombia]], for example, the ''pesebre'' may feature a town and its  surrounding countryside with shepherds and animals. Mary and Joseph are often depicted as rural [[Boyac<U+00E1> Department|Boyac<U+00E1>]] people with Mary clad in a countrywoman's shawl and [[fedora hat]], and Joseph garbed in a [[poncho]]. The infant Jesus is depicted as European with Italianate features. Visitors bringing gifts to the Christ child are depicted as Columbian natives.<ref>Duncan, Ronald J.. ''The Ceramics of R<U+00E1>quira, Colombia: Gender, Work, and Economic Change''. University Press of Florida, 1998. ISBN 0813016150.</ref>

The traditional nativity scene has never been an attempt to accurately depict a gospel event. With no basis in the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass are displayed together at the manger.  Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] and the serpent, [[Noah]] and his animals, the twelve sons of [[Jacob]], the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles.  Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the [[River Jordan]], or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted.<ref name="Mazar" />

===Living nativity scenes===
[[File:Szopka-Wyszk<U+00F3>w-3.jpg|thumb|Living nativity at St. Wojciech Church, Wyszk<U+00F3>w, Poland, 2006]] 

Pantomimes similar to the scene staged by St. Francis at Greccio became an annual event throughout Christendom.  Abuses and exaggerations in the presentation of [[mystery play]]s during the Middles Ages, however, forced the church to prohibit performances during the fifteenth century.<ref name="Dues" /> The plays survived outside church walls, however, and three hundred years after the prohibition, German immigrants brought simple forms of the nativity play to America.  Some features of the dramas became part of both Catholic and Protestant Christmas services with children often taking the parts of characters in the nativity story. Nativity plays and pageants, culminating in living nativity scenes, eventually entered public schools. Today, such exhibitions are challenged on the grounds of separation of church and state.<ref name="Dues" /> 

In some countries, the nativity scene took to the streets with human performers costumed as Joseph and Mary traveling from house to house seeking shelter and being told by the houses' occupants to move on.  The couple's journey culminated in an outdoor tableau at a designated place with the shepherds and the Magi then traveling the streets in parade fashion looking for the Christ child.<ref name="Collins" /> 

Living nativity scenes are not without their problems.  In 2008, for example, vandals destroyed all eight scenes and backdrops at Mount Carmel Christian Church<U+2019>s drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church<U+2019>s 500 members were involved in the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than [[US$]]2,000.<ref>Mehta, Hemant. [http://friendlyatheist.com/2008/12/13/would-you-help-restore-a-nativity-scene/ "Would You Help Restore a Nativity Scene?"]. ''The Friendly Atheist'', December 13, 2008.</ref> Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.

==Animals in nativity scenes==
With no basis in the canonical narratives of the birth of Jesus, an [[ox]] and [[Ass (animal)|ass]] are usually part of the nativity scene.<ref name="Hobgood-Oster">Hobgood-Oster, Laura. ''Holy Dogs and Asses: Animals in the Christian Tradition''. University of Illinois Press, 2008. ISBN 0252032136.</ref> The tradition may arise from an extracanonical text, the Pseudo-Matthew gospel of the eighth century:<blockquote>"And on the third day after the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mary went out of the cave, and, entering a stable, placed the child in a manger, and an ox and an ass adored him. Then was fulfilled that which was said by the prophet [[Isaiah]], "The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Therefore, the animals, the ox and the ass, with him in their midst incessantly adored him. Then was fulfilled that which was said by [[Habakkuk]] the prophet, saying, "Between two animals you are made manifest."<ref name="Hobgood-Oster" /></blockquote>

Considerable symbolism is attached to the ox and the ass. The ox traditionally represents patience, the nation of Israel, and [[Old Testament]] sacrificial worship while the ass represents humility, readiness to serve, and the [[Gentiles]].<ref>Webber, F.R.. ''Church Symbolism''. Kessinger Publishing, 2003. ISBN 0766140091.</ref>

The ox and the ass, as well as other animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition. In a 1415 [[Corpus Christi (feast)|,Corpus Christi]] celebration, the ''Ordo paginarum'' notes that Jesus was lying between an ox and an ass.<ref name="King">King, Pamela M..

By the 1970s, churches and other communities began using zoo animals in their nativity pageants in an attempt to create some authenticity.<ref name="Collins">Collins, Ace. ''Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas''. Zondervan, 2003. ISBN 0310248809.</ref> "Drive-by" or "drive-through" scenes with rented animals such as sheep and donkeys have become popular in California with walking tours also available at outdoor nativities.<ref>[http://www.beachcalifornia.com/california-nativity-living-nativities.html "California Nativity: Drive Thru & Living Nativities in California"]. BeachCalifornia.com. Retrieved January 8, 2008.</ref> 

Some complaint surrounds the use of live animals in nativity scenes. In 2008, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) noted the animals in living nativity scenes lacked adequate exercise and space, suffered exposure to temperature extremes, and were transported to and from displays by substandard means.<ref name="PETA">[http://www.peta.org/feat-nativity.asp "Nativity Scenes or Horror Scenes?"]. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Retrieved January 8, 2008.</ref> Tragedies involving animals were noted by PETA, including the rape of a sheep in a West Virginia nativity display, and the death of a donkey in Richmond, Virginia traffic after dogs chased the animal into the road.<ref name="PETA" /> PETA recommended churches and other organizations promoting live nativity displays spend their funds on relieving the plight of the poor rather renting animals for such displays, and suggested that children dressed as animals participate in such scenes as the humane alternative.<ref name="PETA" />

==Selection of distinctive scenes==
===Vatican nativity scenes===
In 1982, [[Pope John Paul II]] inaugurated the annual tradition<ref name="Away" /> of placing a nativity scene on display at the [[Vatican]] in the [[Piazza San Pietro]] before the [[Christmas Tree]].<ref>Murphy, Bruce and Alessandra de Rosa. ''Italy for Dummies''. For Dummies, 2007. ISBN 0470069325.</ref>

==Controversies==
===United States of America===
Nativity scenes have provoked controversies and lawsuits.<ref>Sherrill, Roland A.. ''Religion and the Life of the Nation''. University of Illinois Press. 1990. pp. 165.</ref>   In [[United States federal courts|federal court]] pleadings in the [[United States]], for example, the [[New York City, New York]], school system defended its ban on nativity scenes by indicating the historicity of the birth of Jesus was not actual fact. The judge in the case upheld the ban, noting that the ban on nativity scenes is not discriminatory while permitting [[Jewish]] [[menorah]]s and [[Islamic]] [[star and crescent]] displays because the latter two have [[secular]] components while nativity scenes are purely religious.<ref name="Limbaugh">Limbaugh, David. ''Persecution: How Liberals Are Waging War Against Christianity''. HarperCollins, 2004. ISBN 0060732075.</ref>   In another instance, a suburban [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], United States school banned a nativity scene while permitting a menorah display. The school's principal stated, "[[Judaism]] is not just a religion, it's a culture."<ref name="Limbaugh" /> 

[[File:NativityScene ChristkindlmarketChicago 12190011a.jpg|thumb|left|A static outdoor nativity scene in the United States, (''Christkindlmarket'', [[Chicago, Illinois]])]]

In 1969, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (representing three [[clergymen]], an [[atheism|atheist]], and a leader of the American Ethical Society),  tried to block the construction of a nativity scene on the [[President's Park#The Ellipse|Ellipse]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.<ref name="Menendez">Menendez, Albert J.. ''Christmas in the White House''. The Westminster Press, 1983.</ref> When the ACLU claimed the government sponsorship of a distinctly Christian symbol violated separation of church and state,<ref name="Menendez" /> the sponsors of the fifty year old Christmas celebration, Pageant of Peace (who had an exclusive permit from the [[Interior Department]] for all events on the Ellipse), responded that the nativity scene was a reminder of America's spiritual heritage.<ref name="Menendez" /> The [[United States Court of Appeals]] ruled on [[December 12]], [[1969]] that the [[cr<U+00E8>che]] be allowed that year.<ref name="Menendez" /> The case dragged on for four more years until [[September 26]], [[1973]] when the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs<ref name="Menendez" /> and found the involvement of the Interior Department and the [[National Park Service]] in the Pageant of Peace amounted to government support for religion.<ref name="Menendez" /> The court ruled that the nativity scene should be dropped from the pageant or the government end its participation in the event in order to avoid "excessive entanglements" between government and religion.<ref name="Menendez" /> In 1973, the nativity scene vanished.<ref name="Menendez" />

In 1985, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''ACLU vs [[Scarsdale, New York]]'' that nativity scenes on public lands violate separation of church and state statutes unless they comply with "The [[Reindeer]] Rule" - a regulation calling for equal opportunity for non-religious symbols such as reindeer.<ref name="Comfort">Comfort, David. ''Just Say Noel: A History of Christmas from the Nativity to the Nineties''. Simon and Schuster, 1995. ISBN 0684800578.</ref>

In 1994, the Christmas in the Park Board of [[San Jose, California]], United States removed a statue of the infant Jesus from [[Plaza de Cesar Chavez Park]] and replaced it with a statue of the plumed [[Aztec]] god, [[Quetzalcoatl]] commissioned with [[US$]]500,000 of public funds.  In response, protestors staged a living nativity scene in the park.<ref name="Comfort" />

In 2006, a lawsuit was brought against the [[state of Washington]] in the United States when it permitted a public display of a "holiday" tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene.<ref name="Capitol" /> As a result of the lawsuit, the decision was made to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in the [[Rotunda]] of the state [[Capitol]] in [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]].<ref name="Capitol" />

Byron Babione, a senior legal counsel with the [[Alliance Defense Fund]], a conservative Christian group in the United States, led the legal battle to display the scene after a private citizen was denied permission to erect the scene. Babione said:<blockquote> "It's incredible to think that Americans have to think twice about whether it is okay to celebrate Christmas in public. Just as it is constitutional for officials to display a menorah and a holiday tree, it is also constitutional to include a Nativity scene...Ninety-five percent of Americans celebrate Christmas. In light of that fact, the inclusion of a Nativity scene by a private citizen is entirely appropriate. More importantly, it does not violate any facet of the law. In fact, the state capitol rotunda is open for displays and exhibits during the holiday season. The state cannot bar a Christmas Nativity because of its religious viewpoint and allow other displays like a menorah and [a] 'holiday tree.'"<ref name="Capitol">"Nativity to be Allowed in Capitol Rotunda:

Retrieved January 5, 2009.</ref>  [[Tony Blair]], [[George W. Bush]], and the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] were cast as the Magi while [[actor]]s [[Hugh Grant]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and comedian [[Graham Norton]] were cast as shepherds. <ref name="BBCPosh">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4078285.stm "Posh and Beckham in Wax Nativity"]. ''BBC News'', December 8, 2004.  Retrieved January 5, 2008.</ref> The celebrities were chosen for the roles by 300 people who visited the Madame Tussaud's in October 2004 and voted on the display.  The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] was not impressed, and a [[Vatican]] spokesperson said the display was in very poor taste. Other officials reacted angrily, with one noting it was "a nativity stunt too far".<ref name="BBCPosh" />"We're sorry if we have offended people," said Diane Moon, a spokesperson for the museum. She said the display was intended in the spirit of fun.<ref>[http://www.redorbit.com/news/oddities/109800/celebrity_nativity_scene_draws_ire_in_uk/index.html "Celebrity Nativity Scene Draws Ire in UK"].

===The Vatican===
In a case similar to that of Madame Tussaud's, the Vatican waived the traditional Bethlehem manger setting of Luke's account in its 2007 nativity scene and placed the event in Joseph's house in Nazareth with his workshop and a busy inn on either side. The display was based on an interpretation of the account in Matthew with the overall theme being [[materialism]] versus [[spirituality]].  The decision for the atypical setting  was believed to be part of a crackdown on fanciful scenes erected in various cities around Italy.<ref name="Away" /> In [[Naples, Italy]], for example, [[Elvis Presley]] and former [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]], were depicted among the shepherds and angels worshiping at the manger.<ref name="Away" />

===Spain===

In 2005, the city council of [[Barcelona, Spain]] commissioned a nativity scene which did not include the [[Catalonia|region]]'s traditional nativity figure, ''el [[caganer]]'', a red-capped [[defecation|defecating]] character which is not a part of the nativity narrative but simply an expression of the  [[irreverence|irreverent]] [[Toilet humour|scatological humour]] of [[southwestern Europe]].<ref name="Catlos">Catlos, Brian. ''The Rough Guide to Languedoc and Roussillon''. Rough Guides, 2004. ISBN 1843532441.</ref>
The council claimed the character set a bad example as [[sanitation]] laws against public [[defecation|elimination]] had recently been passed.<ref>Rose, Jeremy. [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0512/S00250.htm "Barcelona<U+2019>s Christmas Crapper Canned"]. ''Scoop'', December 25, 2005.</ref> The council's decision was viewed as an attack on Catalonian tradition, and, following a campaign against it, ''el caganer'' was restored to the nativity scene in 2006. In addition to the traditional ''caganer'', other characters have appeared assuming the ''caganer'' position. In 2008, a "pooper" of [[Barack Obama]] was made available just days after his election as the President of the United States of America.<ref>[http://au.truveo.com/Obama-pooper-get-one-this-xmas/id/286101039 "Obama Pooper: Get One This Christmas"].
