The '''Hawksbill sea turtle''' (''Eretmochelys imbricata'') is a [[critically endangered]] [[sea turtle]] belonging to the family [[Cheloniidae]]. It is the only [[species]] in its [[genus]]. The species has a worldwide distribution, with [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[subspecies]]. ''E. imbricata imbricata'' is the Atlantic subspecies, while ''E. imbricata bissa'' is found in the Indo-Pacific region.<ref name="ITIS">{{
ITIS |id=173836 |taxon=Eretmochelys imbricata |accessdate=5 February 2007}}</ref>

The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. It has a generally flattened body shape, a protective [[Carapace#Turtles and tortoises|carapace]], and [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]-like arms, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. ''E. imbricata'' is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving [[beak]] with prominent [[tomium]], and the [[wikt:serration|saw-like]] appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it spends more time in shallow [[lagoon]]s and [[coral reef]]s.

Human fishing practices threaten ''E. imbricata'' populations with [[extinction]]. The [[IUCN|World Conservation Union]]. classifies the Hawksbill as [[critically endangered]].<ref name="IUCN"/>  Hawksbill shells are the primary source of ''[[tortoiseshell material|tortoise shell]]'' material, used for decorative purposes. The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] outlaws the capture and trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from them.<ref name="CITESAPP"/>

==Anatomy and morphology==
''E. imbricata'' has the typical appearance of a marine turtle. Like the other members of its family, it has a depressed body form and [[Flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]-like limbs adapted for swimming.

The hawksbill sea turtle has several characteristics that distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a [[beak]]-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's arms have two visible claws on each flipper.

One of the hawksbill's more easily distinguished characteristics is the pattern of thick [[scute]]s that make up its carapace. While its carapace has five central scutes and four pairs of [[Anatomical terms of location#Relative directions|lateral]] scutes like several members of its family, ''E. imbricata'''s [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|posterior]] scutes overlap in such a way as to give the rear margin of its carapace a [[wikt:serration|serrated]] look, similar to the edge of a [[saw]] or a steak knife. The turtle's carapace has been known to reach almost 1 metre (3&nbsp;feet) in length.<ref name="MarineBio">{{

===Indo-Pacific subpopulation===
In the [[Indian Ocean]], hawksbills are a common sight along the east coast of Africa, including the seas surrounding [[Madagascar]] and nearby island groups, and all the way along the southern [[Asia]]n coast, including the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Red Sea]], and the coasts of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. They are present across the [[Indonesian archipelago]] and northern [[Australia]]. The [[Pacific]] range of ''E. imbricata'' is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it extends from the southwestern tips of the [[Korean Peninsula]] and the [[Japanese Archipelago]] down to northern [[New Zealand]].

The [[Philippines]] hosts several nesting sites, including the island of [[Boracay]].<ref name="Star">{{

In the east Pacific, hawksbills are known to occur from the [[Baja peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] south along the coast to northern [[Chile]].<ref name="FIGIS"/> Nonetheless, only a couple of years ago the species had been considered largely extirpated in the region.  Important remnant nesting and foraging sites were recently discovered in [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Ecuador]], providing new opportunities for research and conservation.  In contrast to their traditional roles in other parts of the world, where hawksbills primarily inhabit coral reefs and rocky substrate areas, in the eastern Pacific hawksbills tend to forage and nest principally in mangrove estuaries, such as those present in the [[Bahia de Jiquilisco]] (El Salvador), [[Gulf of Fonseca]] (Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras), Estero Padre Ramos (Nicaragua), and the [[Gulf of Guayaquil]] (Ecuador).  Multi-national initiatives such as the [http://www.hawksbill.org Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative] are currently pushing efforts to research and conserve the population, which remains poorly understood.

==Ecology ==
===Habitat===
Adult hawksbill sea turtles are primarily found in tropical [[coral reef]]s. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges in and around these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit a wide range of habitats, from the open ocean to [[lagoon]]s and even [[mangrove]] swamps in estuaries.<ref name="MarineBio"/><ref name="Lutz1997">{{

===Feeding===
[[Image:Tucacas04012422TortugaCareyEretmochelysImbricata.JPG|thumb|left|''E. imbricata'' in a coral reef in [[Venezuela]]|alt=Photo of swimming turtle with extended head]]
While they are omnivorous, [[sea sponge]]s are the principal food of hawksbill sea turtles. Sponges constitute 70&ndash;95% of their diets in the [[Caribbean]]. However, like many [[spongivore]]s, ''E. imbricata'' feed only on select species, ignoring many others. Caribbean hawksbill populations feed primarily on the orders [[Astrophorida]], [[Spirophorida]], and [[Hadromerida]] in the class [[Demospongiae]].<ref name="ScienceSpongi">{{

Aside from sponges, hawksbills feed on [[algae]] and [[cnidaria]]ns like [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] and other [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemone]]s.<ref name="MarineBio"/> The hawksbill also feeds on the dangerous jellyfish-like [[hydrozoa]]n, the [[Portuguese Man o' War]] (''Physalia physalis''). Hawksbills close their unprotected eyes when they feed on these cnidarians. The Man o' War's [[cnidocyte|stinging cells]] cannot penetrate the turtles' armored heads.<ref name="VDGIF"/>

''E. imbricata'' are highly resilient and resistant to their prey. Some of the sponges eaten by hawksbills, such as ''[[Aaptos aaptos]]'', ''[[Chondrilla nucula]]'', ''[[Tethya actinia]]'', ''[[Spheciospongia vesparium]]'', and ''[[Suberites domuncula]]'', are highly (often lethally) [[toxic]] to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species that have a significant amount of [[siliceous]] [[spicule]]s, such as ''[[Ancorina]]'', ''[[Geodia]]'', ''[[Ecionemia]]'', and ''[[Placospongia]]''.<ref name="ScienceSpongi"/>

===Breeding===
Hawksbills mate biannually in secluded lagoons off their nesting beaches in remote islands throughout their range. Mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually spans April to November. Indian Ocean populations such as the [[Seychelles]] hawksbill population, mate from September to February.<ref name="SeychellesTurtles"/> After mating, females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. They clear an area of debris and dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers. The female then lays a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] of eggs and covers them with sand. [[Caribbean]] and [[Florida]] nests of ''E. imbricata'' normally contain around 140 eggs. After the hours-long process, the female then returns to the sea.<ref name="MarineBio"/><ref name="FWS"/>

The baby turtles, usually weighing less than {{convert|24|g|oz}} hatch at night after around two months. These newly emergent [[hatchling]]s are dark-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around {{cm to in|2.5}} long. They instinctively walk into the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the water (possibly disrupted by light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon by [[shorebirds]], [[Grapsidae|shore crabs]], and other predators.<ref name="MarineBio"/> 

[[Image:HawksbillHatchling.jpg|thumb|left|''E. imbricata'' hatchling in [[Puerto Rico]]|alt=Photo of small turtle walking across sand]]

===Early life===
The early [[life history]] of juvenile hawksbill sea turtles is unknown. Upon reaching the sea, the hatchlings are assumed to enter a [[pelagic]] life stage (like other [[sea turtle|marine turtles]]) for an undetermined amount of time. While hawksbill sea turtle growth rates are not known, when ''E. imbricata'' juveniles reach around {{cm to in|35|}} they switch from a pelagic life style to living on [[coral reef]]s.

==Evolutionary history==
Within the sea turtles, ''E. imbricata'' has several unique [[anatomical]] and [[ecological]] traits. It  is the only primarily [[spongivore|spongivorous]] reptile. Because of this, its evolutionary position is somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses support placement of ''Eretmochelys'' within the [[Tribe (biology)|taxonomic tribe]] [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle|Carettini]], which includes the [[carnivorous]] [[loggerhead turtle|loggerhead]] and [[ridley sea turtle]]s, rather than in the tribe [[Chelonia|Chelonini]], which includes the [[herbivorous]] [[green turtle]].

General consensus has determined sea turtles, including ''E. imbricata'' to be, at the very least, threatened species because of their long lifespans, slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles have been killed by humans, both deliberately and incidentally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}<!-- why is long lifespan a threat?--> In addition, human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites and small mammals dig up  eggs.<ref name="MarineBio"/> In the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[mongoose]]s raid Hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles like ''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]'') right after they are laid.<ref name="MongoosePredation">{{
