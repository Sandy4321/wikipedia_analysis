Eris was first identified in January 2005 by a [[Palomar Observatory]]-based team led by [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], and its identity verified later that year. It is a [[trans-Neptunian object]] (TNO) native to a region of space beyond the [[Kuiper belt]] known as the [[scattered disc]] and has one known [[natural satellite|moon]], [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]]. As of 2011, its distance from the Sun is 96.6&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]],<ref name=AstDys/> roughly three times that of Pluto. With the exception of some [[comets]], Eris and Dysnomia are currently the most distant known natural objects in the Solar System.<ref name="New Planet">{{Cite web

Because Eris appeared possibly to be larger than Pluto, its discoverers<ref>{{Cite web|title=The discovery of 2003 UB313 Eris,  the <s>10th planet</s> largest known dwarf planet|year=2006|url=http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/|author=Mike Brown|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref> and [[NASA]] initially described it as the Solar System<U+2019>s [[Planets beyond Neptune|tenth planet]]. This, along with the prospect of other similarly sized objects being discovered in the future, motivated the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) to [[definition of planet|define the term ''planet'']] for the first time. Under the [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definition]] approved on August&nbsp;24, 2006, Eris is a "dwarf planet" along with Pluto, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]] and [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]].<ref name="IAUPressRelease2006">{{Cite press release

==Discovery==
Eris was discovered by the team of [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], [[Chad Trujillo]], and [[David L. Rabinowitz|David Rabinowitz]]<ref name="New Planet"/> on January&nbsp;5, 2005, from images taken on October&nbsp;21, 2003. The discovery was announced on July&nbsp;29, 2005, the same day as {{dp|Makemake}} and two days after {{dp|Haumea}}.<ref>{{Cite news|title=His Stellar Discovery Is Eclipsed|author=Thomas H. Maugh II and John Johnson Jr.|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/16/local/me-planet16|accessdate=2008-07-14 | date=2005-10-16}}</ref> The search team had been systematically scanning for large outer [[solar system]] bodies for several years, and had been involved in the discovery of several other large TNOs, including [[50000 Quaoar]], [[90482 Orcus]], and [[90377 Sedna]].

Routine observations were taken by the team on October&nbsp;21, 2003, using the 1200&nbsp;mm [[Samuel Oschin telescope|Samuel Oschin]] [[reflecting telescope]] at [[Mount Palomar Observatory]], [[California]], but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team's automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s per hour to reduce the number of [[false positive]]s returned. When Sedna was discovered, it was moving at 1.75&nbsp;arcsec/h, and in light of that the team reanalyzed their old data with a lower limit on the angular motion, sorting through the previously excluded images by eye. In January 2005, the re-analysis revealed Eris' slow motion against the background [[star]]s.

[[File:Animation showing movement of 2003 UB313-2-.gif|thumb|left|Animation showing the movement of Eris on the images used to discover it. Eris is indicated by the arrow. The three frames were taken over a period of three hours.]]
[[File:TheTransneptunians 73AU.svg|left|thumb|Distribution of trans-Neptunian Objects]]

Follow-up observations were then carried out to make a preliminary determination of Eris' [[orbit]], which allowed the object's distance to be estimated. The team had planned to delay announcing their discovery until further observations allowed more accurate calculations of Eris' orbit, but brought their announcement forward when the discovery of another large TNO they had been tracking, {{dp|Haumea}}, was announced by a different team in Spain.<ref name="New Planet"/>

More observations released in October 2005 revealed that Eris had a moon, later named [[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]]. Observations of Dysnomia's orbit permitted scientists to determine the mass of Eris, which in June 2007 they calculated to be (1.66 <U+00B1> 0.02){{e|22}}&nbsp;kg, 27% greater than Pluto's.

==Classification==
Eris is classified as a [[plutoid]]; a [[trans-Neptunian object]] that is also a [[dwarf planet]].<ref name="plutoid">{{Cite web

Although its high orbital inclination is unusual among the known SDOs, theoretical models suggest that objects that were originally near the inner edge of the Kuiper belt were scattered into orbits with higher inclinations than objects from the outer belt.<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> Inner-belt objects are expected to be generally more massive than outer-belt objects, and so astronomers expect to discover more large objects like Eris in high-inclination orbits, which have traditionally been neglected.

Because Eris may be larger than [[Pluto]], it was initially described as the "[[tenth planet]]" by [[NASA]] and in media reports of its discovery.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NASA-Funded Scientists Discover Tenth Planet|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2005-126|work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> In response to the uncertainty over its status, and because of ongoing debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a [[planet]], the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] delegated a group of astronomers to develop a sufficiently precise definition of the term ''planet'' to decide the issue. This was announced as the IAU's ''[[IAU definition of planet|Definition of a Planet in the Solar System]],'' adopted on August 24, 2006. At this time, both Eris and Pluto were classified as ''[[dwarf planet]]s,'' a category distinct from the new definition of ''planet.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.iau.org/Resolutions_5-6.398.0.html|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Resolutions 5 and 6|date=2006-08-24|publisher=IAU}}</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Eris (Discordia).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Athens|Athenian]] painting of [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], circa 550&nbsp;BC]]
Eris is named after the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]] (Greek ''{{polytonic|<U+1F1C><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C2>}}),'' a personification of strife and discord.<ref name=usgs>{{Cite web

| accessdate=2007-01-03 }}</ref>
The name was assigned on September&nbsp;13, 2006 following an unusually long period in which the object was known by the [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] '''{{mp|2003 UB|313}}''', which was granted automatically by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] under their naming protocols for [[minor planet]]s. The regular adjectival form of ''Eris'' is ''Eridian.''

Due to uncertainty over whether the object would be classified as a [[planet]] or a [[minor planet]], as different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects,<ref>

"Xena" was an informal name used internally by the discovery team. It was inspired by the eponymous heroine of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]''. The discovery team had reportedly saved the nickname "Xena" for the first body they discovered that was larger than [[Pluto]]. According to Brown,
<blockquote>We chose it since it started with an X ([[planet X|planet "X"]]), it sounds mythological (OK, so it<U+2019>s TV&nbsp;mythology, but Pluto [[Pluto (Disney)|is named after a cartoon]], right?),{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} and (this part is actually true) we've been working to get more female deities out there (''i.e.'' [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]]). Also, at the time, the TV&nbsp;show was still on TV, which shows you how long we've been searching!<ref>{{Cite web

"We assumed [that] a real name would come out fairly quickly, [but] the process got stalled," Mike Brown said in interview,

<blockquote>One reporter called me up from the ''[[New York Times]]'' who happened to have been a friend of mine from college, [and] I was a little less guarded with him than I am with the normal press. He asked me, "What's the name you guys proposed?" and I said, "Well, I'm not going to tell." And he said, "Well, what do you guys call it when you're just talking amongst yourselves?"... As far as I remember this was the only time I told anybody this in the press, and then it got everywhere, which I only sorta felt bad about<U+2014>I kinda like the name.<ref name=wgbh/></blockquote>

===Choosing an official name===
According to science writer [[Govert Schilling]], Brown initially wanted to call the object "[[Lila]]", after a concept in [[Hindu mythology]] that described the cosmos as the outcome of a game played by [[Brahma]]. The name was very similar to "Lilah", the name of Brown's newborn daughter. Brown was mindful of not making his name public before it had been officially accepted. He had done so with [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] a year previously, and had been heavily criticised. However, he listed the address of his personal web page announcing the discovery as ''/~mbrown/planetlila'' and in the chaos following the [[controversy over the discovery of Haumea]], forgot to change it. Rather than needlessly anger more of his fellow astronomers, he simply said that the webpage had been named for his daughter and dropped "Lila" from consideration.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Hunt For Planet X|author=Govert Schilling|year=2008|publisher=Springer|page=214}}</ref>

Brown had also speculated that ''[[Persephone]]'', the wife of the god [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], would be a good name for the object.<ref name="New Planet" /> The name had been used several times in [[science fiction]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Planet X Marks the Spot|work=TechRepublic|year=2006|url= http://www.sunflower-astronomy.com/KCKCC_Docs/NewsArticles/Geek_Trivia_Planet_X_marks_the_spot.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll conducted by ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Your top 10 names for the tenth planet|author=Sean O'Neill|work=NewScientist|year=2005|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7811|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> However, this was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is already an [[asteroid]] with that name, [[399 Persephone]].<ref name="New Planet" /> Because [[Astronomical naming conventions|IAU regulations]] require a name from [[creation myth]]ology for objects with orbital stability beyond [[Neptune]]<U+2019>s orbit, the team had also been considering such possibilities.<ref name="caltech">{{Cite web

With the dispute resolved, the discovery team proposed ''Eris'' on September&nbsp;6, 2006. On September&nbsp;13, 2006 this name was accepted as the official name by the IAU.<ref name="caltech" /><ref>{{Cite web| title=IAU0605: IAU Names Dwarf Planet Eris | publisher= | date=2006-09-14 | work=International Astronomical Union News | url=http://www.iau.org/iau0605_Eris.409.0.html | accessdate=2007-01-05 }}</ref>
Brown decided that, as the object had been considered a [[planet]] for so long, it deserved a name from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], like the other planets. However, the asteroids had taken the vast majority of Graeco-Roman names. ''Eris'', whom Brown described as his favourite goddess, had fortunately escaped inclusion.<ref name="wgbh">{{Cite web|title=Lowell Lectures in Astronomy|author=Mike Brown|work=WGBH|url=http://forum.wgbh.org/content/forum/3710-2007_04_11.mp3|year=2007|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> The name in part reflects the discord in the astronomical community caused by the debate over the object<U+2019>s (and Pluto<U+2019>s) nature.

The Eridian orbit is highly [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]], and brings Eris to within 37.9&nbsp;AU of the Sun, a typical perihelion for [[scattered disk|scattered objects]]. This is within the orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8<U+2013>30.4&nbsp;AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other [[plutino]]s, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by [[orbital resonance]], can cross Neptune<U+2019>s orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5&nbsp;resonance with Neptune, though further observations will be required to check that hypothesis.<ref>[http://www.orbitsimulator.com/gravity/articles/newtno.html Simulation of Eris ({{mp|2003 UB|313}})'s orbit predicting a 17:5&nbsp;resonance]</ref> Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris' orbit is highly [[inclination|inclined]]: It is tilted at an angle of about 44&nbsp;[[degree (angle)|degrees]] to the [[ecliptic]]. In about 800&nbsp;years, Eris will be closer to the Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).

Eris currently has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 18.7, making it bright enough to be detectable to some amateur [[telescope]]s. A 200&nbsp;mm telescope with a [[Charge-Coupled Device|CCD]] can detect Eris under favourable conditions.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}} The reason it had not been noticed until now is its steep orbital inclination; most searches for large outer Solar System objects concentrate on the ecliptic plane, where most bodies are found.

Eris is now in the constellation [[Cetus (constellation)|Cetus]]. It was in [[Sculptor (constellation)|Sculptor]] from 1876 until 1929 and [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] from roughly 1840 until 1875. In 2036 it will enter [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and stay there until 2065, when it will enter [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]].<ref name=horizons>

It will then move into the [[celestial sphere|northern sky]], entering [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] in 2128 and [[Camelopardalis]] (where it will reach its northernmost [[declination]]) in 2173. Because of the high inclination of its orbit, Eris only passes through a few constellations of the traditional [[Zodiac]].

which is directly measurable with the Hubble Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of the telescope's capabilities,{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} sophisticated image processing techniques such as [[deconvolution]] can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.{{Ref_label|E|e|none}}

This makes Eris only 0<U+2013>8% larger than Pluto, which is about 2,306&nbsp;km across. It also indicates an albedo of 0.86, higher than that of any other large body in the Solar System except [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. It is speculated that the high albedo is due to the surface ices being replenished because of temperature fluctuations as Eris's eccentric orbit takes it closer and farther from the Sun.<ref>

In 2007, a series of observations of the largest trans-Neptunian objects with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] gave an estimate of Eris's diameter of 2,600 (+400; -200)&nbsp;km.<ref name=spitzer /> The Spitzer and Hubble estimates overlap in the range of 2,400<U+2013>2,500&nbsp;km, 4<U+2013>8% larger than Pluto. However, astronomers now suspect that Eris's spin axis is pointing toward the sun, at the moment<U+2014>a possibility that would keep the sunlit hemisphere warmer than average and skew any [[infrared]] measurements toward higher values.<ref name=beatty/> So the outcome from the 2010 Chile [[Occultation#Occultations by asteroids|occultation]] is actually more in line with the Hubble result from 2005.<ref name=beatty/>

In November 2010, Eris was the subject of one of the most distant stellar occulations yet achieved from Earth.<ref name=beatty/> Preliminary data from this event, which has not yet been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, cast doubt on previous size estimates.<ref name=beatty/> The three teams that observed the Eris occulation are still analyzing their data.<ref name=beatty/> Furthermore, when using preliminary data from this event for comparison to Pluto, there is a range of figures available for Pluto's radius/diameter that can be selected.<ref name=young07>[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007DPS....39.6205Y '''Pluto's Radius'' <U+2013> Young, Eliot F.; Young, L. A.; Buie, M.

Please check talk page before editing about the November 2010 occultation event, and related Eris/Pluto size issues -->

The mass of Eris can be calculated with much greater precision. Based on the currently accepted value for Dysnomia's period<U+2014>15.774 days<U+2014><ref name=mass/><ref>
{{Cite web|title=Dysnomia, the moon of Eris|author=Mike Brown|work=CalTech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/planetlila/moon/index.html |year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref>Eris is 27&nbsp;percent more massive than Pluto. Within the margin of error for Eris's diameter, this figure suggests Eris and Pluto are broadly similar in composition, as Eris's diameter need only be 7% larger than Pluto's to achieve the same density.<ref name=occult/><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Dwarf Planet Known as Eris is More Massive than Pluto, New Data Shows|publisher=CalTech|year=2007|url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13003|accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref> However, if the 2010 occultation results are used, then Eris is substantially denser than Pluto, and thus must be composed largely of rocky materials.<ref name=occult/>

===Thermal measurement===
Previous observations of the thermal emission of Eris at a wavelength of 1.2&nbsp;mm, where the object's brightness depends only on temperature and surface area, indicated a diameter of 3,000 <U+00B1> 400&nbsp;km, about a third larger than Pluto.<ref name="bertoldi">{{Cite web| title=Comment on the Recent Hubble Space Telescope size measurement of 2003 UB313 by Brown et al. |date=2006-02-02 | work=Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy| url=http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~bertoldi/ub313/ | accessdate=2007-01-05 }}</ref> If Eris rotates quickly, resulting in a more even heat distribution and a temperature of 23 to 24&nbsp;[[kelvin]]s (&minus;250 to &minus;249 degrees Celsius), a likely diameter would be in the higher portion of the range (best fit 3,090&nbsp;km); if it rotates slowly, the visible surface would be warmer (about 27&nbsp;K, or &minus;246 degrees Celsius) and a likely diameter would be in the smaller end of the range (best fit 2,860&nbsp;km). The 2,860&nbsp;km figure implies a Pluto-like albedo of 60%, consistent with Eris's Pluto-like spectral signature.

The apparent inconsistency of the HST [[Point spread function|PSF]] results (2,400 <U+00B1> 100&nbsp;km) with the above [[Institut de radioastronomie millim<U+00E9>trique|IRAM]] results (3,000 <U+00B1> 370&nbsp;km) will certainly be studied at greater length.  Brown explains it by a slightly lower [[absolute magnitude]] than the one assumed by Bertoldi (<U+2212>1.12&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;0.01 versus <U+2212>1.18&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;0.1, resulting by itself in almost 100&nbsp;km difference in diameter). Assuming further the highest diameter (2,500&nbsp;km) and pole-on position of the object,{{Ref_label|F|f|none}} the difference between the results would appear consistent with 1.1-[[standard deviation|<U+03C3> error margin]].

Another possible explanation for the IRAM results is offered by the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy|Max-Planck-Institut f<U+00FC>r Radioastronomie]]. The ratio between the [[bolometric magnitude|bolometric]] albedo (representing the total reflected energy and used in the thermal method) and the geometric albedo (representing the reflection in some visual wavelength and used to calculate the diameter from HST pictures) is not known with high precision and depends on many factors. By itself, this uncertainty could bridge the gap between the two measures.<ref name="bertoldi"/>

==Surface and atmosphere==
[[File:2003 UB313 near-infrared spectrum.gif|thumb|right|The infrared spectrum of Eris, compared to that of Pluto, shows the marked similarities between the two bodies. Arrows denote methane absorption lines.]]
[[File:2006-16-a-full-1-.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's impression of Eris and Dysnomia. Eris is the main object, Dysnomia the small grey disk just above it. The flaring object top-left is the Sun.]]

The discovery team followed up their initial identification of Eris with [[astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observations made at the 8&nbsp;m [[Gemini North Telescope]] in Hawaii on January&nbsp;25, 2005. Infrared light from the object revealed the presence of [[methane]] ice, indicating that the surface may be similar to that of Pluto, which at the time was the only [[trans-Neptunian object|TNO]] known to have surface methane, and of Neptune's moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], which also has methane on its surface.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gemini Observatory Shows That "10th Planet" Has a Pluto-Like Surface|url=http://www.gemini.edu/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=142 |work=Gemini Observatory|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

Due to Eris's distant eccentric orbit, Eridian surface temperatures are estimated to vary between about 30 and 56 kelvins (<U+2212>243 and <U+2212>217&nbsp;degrees Celsius).<ref name="New Planet"/>

Unlike the somewhat reddish Pluto and Triton, however, Eris appears almost grey.<ref name="New Planet"/> Pluto's reddish colour is believed to be due to deposits of [[tholin]]s on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough away from the Sun that methane can [[condensation|condense]] onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.<ref>

Even though Eris can be up to three times further from the Sun than Pluto, it approaches close enough that some of the ices on the surface might warm enough to [[sublimation (physics)|sublimate]]. As methane is highly [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its [[atmosphere]]. This contrasts with observations of another recently discovered TNO, {{dp|Haumea}}, which reveal the presence of [[water]] ice but not methane.<ref>

Images taken on September&nbsp;10 revealed a [[natural satellite|moon]] in orbit around Eris. In keeping with the "Xena" nickname already in use for Eris, Brown's team nicknamed the moon "[[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]]", after the television warrior princess's sidekick. When Eris received its official name from the IAU, the moon received the name ''[[Dysnomia (moon)|Dysnomia]],'' after the [[Dysnomia (mythology)|Greek goddess of lawlessness]] who was Eris's daughter. The name also retains an oblique reference to Eris's old informal name ''Xena'', portrayed on TV by [[Lucy Lawless]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=All Hail Eris and Dysnomia|author=David Tytell|year=2006|work=Sky and Telescope|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/3916126.html|accessdate=2010-01-05}}</ref>
