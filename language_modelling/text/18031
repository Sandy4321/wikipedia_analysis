'''Sunil Kumar Verma''' (born 28{{nbsp}}September 1974), is an Indian biologist and {{As of|2015|01|alt=as of January 2015}} the principal scientist at the [[Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology]], [[Hyderabad]], India. Verma is primarily known for his contributions to the development of "universal primer technology", a DNA barcoding method, that can identify any bird, fish, reptile or mammal from a tiny biological sample, and satisfy legal evidence requirements in a court of law. This technology has revitalised the field of wildlife forensics and is now routinely used across India to provide a species identification service in cases of wildlife crime.

Verma received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil.]] in [[Oncology|medical oncology]] from the [[University of Oxford]], and has worked in the areas of [[signal transduction]] in cancer and [[wildlife conservation]]. He is the recipient of several national awards, including the 2008 [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research|CSIR]] Technology Award, the 2009 [[National Research Development Corporation|NRDC]] Meritorious Invention Award and the 2009 BioAsia Innovation Award in recognition of his contribution to Indian science and technology.

== Education and research career ==

=== Early life and education ===
Verma was born in a small village in the northern Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Verma grew up primarily in [[Tikri, Uttar Pradesh|Tikri]] and up to the twelfth standard studied at the government school in Tikri.<ref name ="inscorg_bio">{{cite web|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Verma, S.K., Biography & journey through Science|url=http://vermask.indianscholars.org/profile/|website=www.vermask.indianscholars.org|publisher=Indianscholars Press|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> After completing his twelfth standard in the science group from this school in 1991, he attended the [[G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology]], Pantnagar to complete his Bachelor of Science in agriculture and animal husbandry.<ref name ="inscorg_bio" />

=== Research career ===
[[File:Lindau Honor2003.jpg|thumb|[[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureates Meet]] 2003 <U+2013> Memorabilia and Honor: Signed by <U+2013> nine Nobel Laureates (center), Indian delegation of scholars (periphery) and President of India [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] (bottom right). Verma attended the meeting and signed the document (bottom middle).]]

Verma started his research career at [[G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology]], Pantnagar, where he worked on the [[DNA profiling|DNA fingerprinting]] of Indian scented [[basmati]] rice for identification of duplicate accessions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Verma|first1=Sunil Kumar|last2=Khanna|first2=Vijay|last3=Singh|first3=Nagendra|title=Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis of Indian scented basmati rice (Oryza sativa L.) germplasm for identification of variability and duplicate accessions, if any|journal=Electrophoresis|date=1999|volume=20|issue=8|page=1786-1789|pmid=10435450|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10435450|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> In 1998, Verma was appointed as a scientist at the [[Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics]] (CDFD) where he continued his research on the DNA-based identification system, and in 1999, he received the Emerging Forensic Scientist Continental Award from the International Association of Forensic Sciences at the [[University of California]], USA for his work on DNA [[microsatellite]] based identification of wild animals.<ref name ="daad_bio>{{cite web|title=Brief Profiles of DAAD Research Ambassadors in India|url=http://www.daaddelhi.org/en/23633/index.html|accessdate=25 December 2014|website=www.daaddelhi.org|publisher=[[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]], New Delhi}}</ref><ref name="panda">{{cite web|last1=Thakur|first1=Mukesh|title=ROLE OF DNA FORENSICS IN CURBING ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE|publisher=[[WWF-India]]|page=14|url=http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/traffic_panda_8_oct.pdf|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref>

=== Universal primer technology and DNA barcoding ===

Verma has argued that [[DNA barcoding]], a technique independently described by zoologist [[Paul D N Hebert]] in 2003,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hebert|first1=Paul DN|last2=Cywinska|first2=Alina|last3=Ball|first3=Shelley L|last4=deWaard|first4=Jeremy R|title=Biological identifications through DNA barcodes|journal=[[Proc Biol Sci.]]|date=2003|volume=270|issue=1512|page=313-321|doi=10.1098/rspb.2002.2218|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref> is essentially the same as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species.<ref name="AutoZ3-1" /><ref name="upt" /><ref name="nature">{{cite journal|last1=Jayaraman|first1=KS|title=DNA-based animal identification technique in credit dispute|url=http://www.natureasia.com/en/nindia/article/10.1038/nindia.2015.20|journal=Nature India|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>. Verma claimed priority of UPT over DNA barcoding; however, Hebert argues that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filling in 2001 to grant in 2006.<ref name="nature" /><ref>{{cite news|last=IANS|title=Indian scientists peeved over credit grab|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Indian-scientists-peeved-over-credit-grab/articleshow/46200425.cms|website=www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=IANS|title=Indian scientists peeved over credit grab|url=http://www.thestatesman.com/news/tech/indian-scientists-peeved-over-credit-grab/47957.html|website=http://www.thestatesman.com|publisher=[[The Statesman]]|date=11 February 2015|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>
