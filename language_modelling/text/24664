[[Apu]] is immediately fired and replaced by actor [[James Woods]], who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.

==Plot==
At the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], [[Apu]] lowers the price on expired meat instead of throwing it out. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] buys the meat, eats it, and becomes terribly ill. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain angrily, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired [[shrimp]] to placate him. Once again, Homer takes it, eats it, and becomes terribly ill. This time, however, as he is recovering, Homer sees the [[Investigative journalism|investigative news]] program ''Bite Back with Kent Brockman'', hosted by Channel 6 journalist [[Kent Brockman]]. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a [[Hidden camera|spy camera]] to [[Expos<U+00E9> (journalism)|expose]] Apu for selling expired food. While inside the store, the camera catches Apu re-selling a hot dog that recently fell on the ground.  Kent comments how they now have evidence to convict him. Apu is immediately fired, and is replaced by actor [[James Woods]], who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.

After being fired, Apu does chores for Homer because he thinks that he is in debt to Homer for selling him expired food, and helping him would pay off his debt of [[karma]]. As time goes by, the family begins to love Apu and his traditions. However, Apu begins to miss his job at the Kwik-E-Mart, so Homer decides to help him by accompanying him to the Kwik-E-Mart head office in [[India]]. Once they arrive, they meet with the head of the Kwik-E-Mart corporation, who says that they can ask him three questions. Unfortunately, due to his incompetence, Homer wastes the three questions and the head of the Kwik-E-Mart does not help Apu with his problems. Apu and Homer are forced to return home disappointed.

When they get home to Springfield, Apu decides to return to the Kwik-E-Mart to "face his demons". A robber bursts into the store and shoots at Woods, but Apu saves him by jumping in front of the bullet. At the hospital, [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]] says that Apu survived because the bullet ricocheted off another bullet that was lodged in his chest from a previous robbery. Eternally grateful, Woods offers Apu his job back.

The episode was written by [[Greg Daniels]], and directed by [[Mark Kirkland]]. It was the first episode of the show that Daniels wrote.<ref name="Daniels">{{cite video | people=Daniels, Greg|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer and Apu"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' writers [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], who were [[show runner]]s during the previous two seasons, came up with the idea for the episode. They left the idea with [[David Mirkin]], who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was "very excited and intrigued" with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would "step up" and "throw himself into it".<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer and Apu"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to "bring it back" to character and story, unlike the previous season which got "so fast-moving and so full of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]] gags". Mirkin added: "I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. I had one of the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, "[[The Last Temptation of Homer]]", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, "[[Bart's Girlfriend]]", plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals."<ref>{{cite news|title=1994 vintage `Simpsons' sets a tough standard - Homer's head houses DVDs |last=Klein|first=Joshua|date=September 9, 2005 |work=Chicago Tribune|pages=7|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref> Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a "wonderful crew" on the episode, including [[Bob Anderson]], who he thought was a "wonderful" director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did "fine animation throughout".<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Mark, Kirkland|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer and Apu"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> 

When Mirkin took over as show runner, he listed actor [[James Woods]] as one of the people he would most like to guest star on the show. [[Michael Caine]] was originally supposed to be the actor in the episode who takes over Apu's job at the Kwik-E-Mart, but he rejected the role. The story was therefore rewritten so that Woods received Apu's job instead.<ref name="Mirkin"/> Woods was one of animation director [[David Silverman]]'s favorite guest stars.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer and Apu"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Mirkin said he provided one of the "most fantastic" performances ever on the show, and commented that he "nailed" all of his lines and was "so funny, right at the top of his head".<ref name="Mirkin"/> Mirkin said that when most guest stars come in to record their lines for the show, they are a little nervous because they have never done [[voice-over]] before. Mirkin noted, however, that Woods was a "fearless guy" and he was "so excited to do it because he was a huge fan of the show".<ref name="Mirkin"/> Silverman noted that in addition to his humorous [[ad-libbing]], Woods's tendency to hesitate while speaking was "great for animation", explaining that it made the character feel more realistic.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC Interview with David Silverman |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page5.shtml |accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> "Homer and Apu" features the popular ''Simpsons'' song "Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart?", sung by Apu and the Simpson family while Apu stays at their house. The song was written by all of the show's writers in the writer's room, and it was composed by [[Alf Clausen]].<ref name="Daniels"/> The song later appeared on the soundtrack album ''[[Songs in the Key of Springfield]]'', which was released on March 18, 1997, and compiled many musical numbers from the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Simpsons-Songs-Springfield-Original-Television/dp/B0000033Z8|title=Songs In The Key Of Springfield - Original Music From The Television Series |publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
The episode features cultural references to many American and British films. Woods becoming a convenience store clerk to prepare for a film is similar to Nick Lang ([[Michael J. Fox]]) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'', which Woods also starred in.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page12.shtml|title=Homer and Apu|accessdate=2008-08-17|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to "nail" Apu, Homer replies: "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" This is a reference to a line by [[Danny DeVito]] in the 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''.<ref name="BBC"/> The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name="Mirkin"/> In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in ''[[True Believer (1989 film)|True Believer]]'' I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film ''[[Chaplin (film)|Chaplin]]'' I had a little cameo in that.  I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," referencing the 1989 film ''True Believer'' and the 1992 film ''Chaplin''.<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=134}}</ref>

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: "One of the very best, with the gags coming thick and fast. We particularly like the spy camera concealed in Homer's massive stetson, Apu and Marge's trip to the Monster Mart (Apu's advice on supermarket queue-jumping is worth heeding), and 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?', possibly the cleverest song in the series. And the Christians harassing people at the Indian airport, and Homer's wastage of three questions, and James Woods' parting words to the Simpsons, and the footage of Apu doing a [[hummingbird]] impression..."<ref name="BBC"/> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: "The first episode to focus on Apu, this one works well. Our glimpses of Apu<U+2019>s sleaziness and culture are entertaining, and the 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?' tune is one of the better musical numbers [of the show]." Jacobson went on to say: "Also count [[James Woods]] as one of the all-time best guest stars, which is likely why he gets many more lines than the average cameo voice."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A+ and commented that it features one of the best musical numbers in the show's "history of great musical numbers".<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Patrick }}</ref> Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the best episode of the season, and added: "I don<U+2019>t know what it is about this episode <U+2014> the 'Who Needs the Kwik-E-Mart?' song number; James Woods filling in for Apu at the store; or Homer<U+2019>s wise line 'I<U+2019>ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish [[Ned Flanders|Flanders]] was dead' <U+2014> but the entire affair is inspired.

===Analysis===
The episode has become study material for sociology courses at [[University of California Berkeley]], where it is used to "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show", and to figure out what it is "trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies." Some questions asked in the courses include: "What aspects of American society are being addressed in the episode? What aspects of them are used to make the points? How is the satire conveyed: through language? Drawing? Music? Is the behavior of each character consistent with his/her character as developed over the years? Can we identify elements of the historical/political context that the writers are satirizing? What is the difference between satire and parody?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/undergrads/syllabi/Soc190_1.pdf|publisher=University of California Berkeley|title=The Simpsons Global Mirror |year=2008|author=Thomas B. Gold}}</ref>

In the book ''[[Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|Leaving Springfield]]'', Duncan Beard said the episode served as an parody of the peculiarities of the American convenience store. Beard particularly cited the [[Muzak]] and the dinging bell as Homer and Apu entered the Kwik-E-Mart in India, and the sign that read, "The Master Knows All (except combination to safe)". Beard said, "Here the show presents its own instance of the global culture of consumer capitalism, transplanted intact and indistinguishably unaltered from the suburbs of America to a mountain top in some indefinable region of the post-partitioned Commonwealth nation of India, purely for the purpose of parodically criticizing the banality of quick-stop stores."<ref>{{cite book|last=Beard|first=Duncan|title=Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|publisher=Wayne State University Press|date=2003|pages=286|isbn=0814328490}}</ref>

Paul Cantor, who analyzed the episode in his book ''Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization'', said, ""''The Simpsons'' could offer no better image of the bizarre logic of contemporary globalization than a worldwide convenience store empire run by an enlightened [[guru]] from the sacred mountains of India." Cantor also specifically cited the "Master Knows" sign, which he said combined the perceived wisdom of the East with the business acumen of the West.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cantor|first=Paul|title=Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|date=2003|pages=98|isbn=0742507793|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=A6Qr6BFJUjoC&pg=RA1-PA97&dq=%22Homer+and+Apu%22#PRA1-PA98,M1}}</ref>

Tasleem Shakur and Karen D'Souza writes in their book ''Picturing South Asian culture in English'' that "Homer and Apu" typifies the key articulation of the character of Apu juxtaposed to Homer, "something like his alter-ego", where Homer is the all American, Duff drinking, rather lazy nuclear plant worker, and Apu is the immigrant, clean living, hard working, small businessman. Their friendship, the authors added, is typically of a strong degree of mutual respect and a kind of admiration for what the other represents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shakur|first=Tasleem|coauthors=D'Souza, Karen|title=Picturing South Asian culture in English|publisher=Open House Press|date=2003|pages=170|isbn=0954446305|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=B7T4T1oK_-IC&hl=sv}}</ref>
