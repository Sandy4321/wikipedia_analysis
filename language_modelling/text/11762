'''Kevin Cannon''' is an American cartoonist and illustrator.

==Biography==
Cannon first published work was ''Johnny Cavalier'', published by [[Grinnell College]] Press, which included 100 pages of weekly strips that originally ran in the ''[[Scarlet and Black]]''. While attending Grinnell, Kevin was often asked if he was [[Zander Cannon]]'s brother. This caused him to contact Zander at [[The Handicraft Guild]] in [[Minneapolis]] and began work as his assistant. Kevin did background illustrations for ''[[Smax]]'', published by [[DC Comics]] and illustrated ''[[The Handsome Prince]]'' by author [[Tom Hegg]]. Kevin and Zander's working relationship eventually led to their founding of [[Big Time Attic]] with [[Shad Petosky]]. With Zander he went on to write the sequel to [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top Ten]]''.
