==Release history==
''Watershed'' was released as a standard edition, a 180&nbsp;gram [[gramophone record|vinyl]] edition, and a special edition. The special edition includes three bonus tracks, a bonus DVD with a 5.1 surround sound mix of the entire album (not including bonus tracks), video content featuring rehearsals, and studio footage, as well as expanded artwork. The vinyl release comes in gatefold packaging, and contains the album on two LPs, as well as a CD copy of the album (both including the bonus track "Derelict Herds") and a poster.

"Mellotron Heart" was included on a separate disc with a limited number of copies of the album. It is an alternate recording of the song "Porcelain Heart", performed on [[mellotron]] and mini-Moog synthesizers. The cover for the CD is the standard album artwork with the figure and writing desk replaced by a mellotron. The track is also available as a free digital download exclusively for those who pre-ordered the album from [[The End Records]], and to people who insert the CD into their computer via [[Opendisc]].<ref name="Mellotron Heart Digital">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/getopeth/ |title=Mellotron Heart: Exclusive Digital Delivery for Opeth Pre-Order |publisher=RoadrunnerRecords.com |accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref>
