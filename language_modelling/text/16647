The '''meteorological history of Hurricane Gordon''' consisted of a thirteen-day period in which the storm's path was erratic, persistent, and highly unusual. The hurricane formed near [[Panama]] in the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on November 10 1994. As a [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical depression]] it brushed [[Nicaragua]] and spent several days in the waters off the country's coast. Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm, Gordon wound its way north into the [[Greater Antilles]]. Despite warm waters, persistent [[wind shear]] prevented significant strengthening. Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest, Gordon made two more landfalls, on eastern [[Jamaica]] and eastern [[Cuba]], while delivering tremendous rains to western [[Hispaniola]].

As Tropical Storm Gordon made its fourth landfall crossing the [[Florida Keys]], it interacted with a [[cyclone]] in the [[Troposphere|upper-troposphere]]  and a series of cyclonic [[Low pressure area|lows]] which lent the storm some sub-tropical characteristics. After a few days as a  unusual hybrid of a  tropical and a subtropical system in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the storm re-claimed its fully tropical form and made yet another landfall, this time across the Florida peninsula, and continued into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In the Atlantic, Gordon rapidly strengthened to a [[Saffir-Simpson Scale|Category 1 Hurricane]]. Gordon's characteristic wandering briefly brought it near [[North Carolina]], but ultimately the storm headed south, weakening into a minor tropical storm before making its sixth and final landfall on Florida's east coast.

[[Hurricane Gordon (1994)|Hurricane Gordon]] was the seventh named storm and third [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] of the [[1994 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Although it never made landfall as a hurricane, in its meandering course the storm included six separate landfalls: four as a tropical storm and two as a tropical depression. Three of its landfalls were in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]].

==Formation==
During the first week of November a large area of disturbed weather accumulated just north of Panama over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. A [[tropical wave]] passed through the area and gave it mild [[Atmospheric convection|convection]]<!-- on DATE, +cite-->. A second wave passed through the area on November 6 and introduced [[Tropical cyclone|cyclonic circulation]] to the disturbance. Over the next two days the system gradually organized and sparked a deep convection off Nicaragua's southeast coast.<ref name="prelim">{{cite web|author=Pasch, Richard J.|publisher=National Hurricane Center|title=Preliminary Report Hurricane Gordon 8-21 November 1994|date=1995-01-10|accessdate=2008-07-14|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1994gordon.html}}</ref> This organization, with initial maximum sustained winds of 30&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (45&nbsp;[[kilometers per hour|km/h]]), was designated [[Tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|Tropical Depression]] Twelve.<ref name="TCD_01">{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-08|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 1|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.001}}</ref> Moving northwest, the storm began to slowly strengthen<ref name="prelim"/> and its upper level  outflow became favorable to further development.<ref name="TCD_02">{{cite web|author=Mayfield|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-08|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 2|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.002}}</ref> Spots of convection flared on the morning of November 9;<ref name="TCD_03">{{cite web|author=Rappaport|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-09|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 3|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.003}}</ref>  [[Tropical_cyclone#Banding|banding]] features appeared  as its center made landfall on the northeastern Nicaraguan coast near [[Puerto Cabezas]].<ref name="TCD_05">{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-09|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 5|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.005}}</ref> A full day later a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] to the storm's northwest over the Gulf of Mexico moved the depression offshore,<ref name="TCD_04">{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-09|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Depression Twelve Discussion Number 4|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.004}}</ref> to the northeast, and over the warm waters of the western Caribbean Sea.<ref name="prelim"/> Fueled by these warm waters, on the night of November 9 it strengthened into [[Tropical Storm]] Gordon with 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="TCD_09">{{cite web|author=Avila|publisher=National Hurricane Center|date=1994-11-10|accessdate=2008-07-14|title=Tropical Storm Gordon Discussion Number 9|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1994/gordon/tropdisc/nal1294.008}}</ref>
