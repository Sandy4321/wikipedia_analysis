'''Herpes simplex''' is a [[viral disease]] caused by [[Herpes simplex virus]]es.  Infection of the [[genital]]s is commonly known as ''herpes'' and predominantly occurs following sexual transmission of the type 2 strain of the virus (HSV-2).<ref name="pmid18156035">{{cite journal |author=Gupta R, Warren T, Wald A |title=Genital herpes |journal=Lancet |volume=370 |issue=9605 |pages=2127<U+2013>37 |year=2007 |pmid=18156035 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61908-4}}</ref> Oral herpes, colloquially called ''cold sores'', is usually caused by the type 1 strain of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1).<ref name="pmid15596324">{{cite journal |author=Bruce AJ, Rogers RS |title=Oral manifestations of sexually transmitted diseases |journal=Clin.

Disorders such as [[herpetic whitlow]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and ocular herpes are caused by herpes simplex viruses.

Prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections varies throughout the world.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>  [[Socioeconomic]] status appears to be an important factor associated with HSV-1 infection levels with developing countries, such as those in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], showing higher levels of HSV-1 and younger acquisition rates than industrialized countries like the [[United States]] and countries in [[Northern Europe]].  The risk of infection for HSV-1 is associated with lower income and a more crowded living environment. Levels of HSV-2 infections are much lower in the U.S. (20-30%), [[Australia]] (12%), the [[United Kingdom]] (4%) and Germany (14%).<ref name="pmid16926356">{{cite journal |author=Xu F, Sternberg MR, Kottiri BJ, ''et al'' |title=Trends in herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 seroprevalence in the United States |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=8 |pages=964<U+2013>73 |year=2006 |pmid=16926356 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.8.964}}</ref> Risk Factors for acquiring HSV-2 include: Female sex; black race; commencement of sexual activity at a younger age; higher number of sexual partners; and lower socioeconomic status.

Treatments are available to reduce the symptoms and speed up the healing process of herpes infections but there is currently no cure.<ref name="pmid18186706"/> Antiviral drugs, such as [[aciclovir]] and [[valaciclovir]], taken orally, reduce viral reproduction and shedding, and some topical creams, such as [[Docosanol]] and [[Tromantadine]] prevent the virus from entering the skin.  Some other drugs reduce herpetic symptoms by synergising with oral antiviral medication; [[Cimetidine]] and [[probenecid]] can reduce aciclovir clearance and [[aspirin]] can reduce [[inflammation]] associated with viral infection.  Some natural remedies may have potential benefits in reducing herpes outbreaks or their symptoms.  No [[vaccine]] is currently available to prevent or treat herpes.<ref name="pmid18186706"/>

==Disorders==
Several distinct [[Disorder (medicine)|disorders]] are caused by HSV infection of the skin or mucosa including those that affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (herpes whitlow).  More serious problems arise when the virus infects and damages the eye (herpes keratitis) or invades the central nervous system to damage the brain (herpes encephalitis).  Newborn infants, with their under-developed immune systems, are also prone to serious complications due to HSV infection (neonatal herpes).

Infection by HSV-1 is the most common cause of herpes that affects the face and mouth (orofacial herpes) although recent years are seeing an increase in oral HSV-2 infections.<ref name="pmid15596324"/> A majority of primary HSV-1 infections occur during childhood and, if the virus has come into contact with the mucosa or abraded skin, can cause acute herpetic [[gingivostomatitis]] (inflammation of the mucosa of the cheek and gums) within 5<U+2013>10 days. Some other symptoms may also develop, including fever and sore throat, and painful [[ulcer]]s may appear.<ref name="pmid15596324"/> Primary HSV infection in adolescents frequently manifests as severe [[pharyngitis]] with lesions developing on the cheek and gums. Some individuals develop difficulty in swallowing ([[dysphagia]]) and swollen [[lymph node]]s ([[lymphadenopathy]]).<ref name="pmid15596324"/> Primary HSV infections in adults often presents as pharyngitis similar to that observed in glandular fever ([[infectious mononucleosis]]), but gingivostomatitis is less likely. The symptoms of primary HSV infection generally resolve within two weeks.<ref name="pmid15596324"/>

Once a primary oral HSV-1 infection has resolved, the HSV enters the nerves surrounding the primary lesion, migrates to the [[cell body]] of the neuron, and becomes latent in the [[trigeminal ganglion]].  In some people, the virus reactivates to cause recurrent infection - this is more common with HSV-1 than HSV-2 oral infection. [[Prodromal]] symptoms often precede a recurrence, which typically begins with reddening of the skin around the infected site, with eventual ulceration to form fluid-filled [[blister]]s that affect the lip (labial) tissue and the area between the lip and skin (vermilion border).  The recurrent infection is thus often called ''herpes simplex labialis''. Rare occasions of reinfections occur inside the mouth  (''intraoral HSV stomatitis'') affecting the gums, [[alveolar ridge]], [[hard palate]], and the back of the tongue - this may be accompanied with ''herpes labialis''.<ref name="pmid15596324"/><ref>{{Who| title =Herpes Online:  Exploring the "H" Community  | pages =1-4  | format = PDF| language =English  | publisher =American Social Health Association   | date=  1996  | url =http://www.ashastd.org/pdfs/HELPER_SPRING_05.pdf  | accessdate = 2007-03-29 }}</ref>
Oral herpes is spread by direct contact with an active sore in an infected person, for instance, during kissing. However virus can be transmitted through the skin in the absence of a lesion.  Oral herpes and cold sores can sometimes be confused with [[canker sores]].

Clusters of inflammed [[papule]]s and [[vesicle]]s on the outer surface of the genitals represent the typical symptoms of a primary HSV-1 or HSV-2 genital infection.  These usually appear 4<U+2013>7 days after sexual exposure to HSV for the first time,<ref name="pmid18156035"/> and may resemble cold sores.<ref name="titleSTD Facts - Genital Herpes">{{cite web |url=http://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm |title=STD Facts - Genital Herpes |accessdate=2008-02-22 |format= |work=}}</ref> In males, the lesions occur on the shaft of the [[penis]] or other parts of the genital region, on the inner thigh, buttocks, or [[anus]]. In females, lesions appear on or near the [[Mons pubis|pubis]], [[Labium (genitalia)|labia]], [[clitoris]], [[vulva]], buttocks or anus.<ref name="titleSTD Facts - Genital Herpes"/> Other common symptoms include pain, itching, and burning.  Less frequent, yet still common, symptoms include discharge from the penis or [[vagina]], [[fever]], [[headache]], muscle pain ([[myalgia]]),  swollen and enlarged lymph nodes and [[malaise]].<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Women often experience additional symptoms that include painful urination ([[dysuria]]) and [[cervicitis]], while herpetic [[proctitis]] (inflammation of the anus and rectum) is common for individuals participating in anal intercourse.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> After 2<U+2013>3 weeks, existing lesions progress into ulcers and then crust and heal, although lesions on mucosal surfaces may never form crusts.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> The virus is not removed from the body by [[immune system]], but enters [[nerve]] [[ganglion|ganglia]] that serve the infected [[dermatomic area|dermatome]] where it becomes dormant.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> 

Many HSV infected people experience a recurrence within the first year of infection, when the virus reactivates from its latent state.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Development of lesions follows [[prodrome]] - which warns of a recurrence and includes tingling ([[paresthesia]]), itching, and pain where lumbosacral nerves innervate the skin - by hours to days. In some individuals, starting to take antiviral treatment when prodrome is experienced can reduce the appearance and duration of lesions. Fewer lesions are likely to develop that cause less pain and heal faster (5<U+2013>10 days without antiviral treatment) than during the primary infection.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Subsequent outbreaks tend to be periodic or episodic, occur on average four to five times a year when not using [[antiviral therapy]], and may be triggered by [[stress (medicine)|stress]], illness, fatigue, [[menstruation]].  HSV-2 is widespread, affecting an estimated 1 in 4 females and 1 in 5 males in the [[United States of America|United States]].  Although certain therapies can prevent outbreaks or reduce the risk of transmission to partners, no cure is yet available.<ref name="titleSTD Facts - Genital Herpes"/><ref name="pmid18156035"/>

===Herpes whitlow===
Herpes whitlow ([[herpetic whitlow]]) is a painful infection that typically manifest itself on fingers or thumbs and occasionally on the toes, or on the nail cuticle, and is caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2.<ref name="pmid14677662">{{cite journal |author=Clark DC |title=Common acute hand infections |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=68 |issue=11 |pages=2167<U+2013>76 |year=2003 |pmid=14677662 |doi=}}</ref> It is typically contracted by healthcare workers that come in contact with the virus; it is most commonly contracted by dental workers and medical workers exposed to oral secretions.<ref name="pmid15119801">{{cite journal |author=Lewis MA |title=Herpes simplex virus: an occupational hazard in dentistry |journal=Int Dent J |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=103<U+2013>11 |year=2004 |pmid=15119801 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid12236568">{{cite journal |author=Avitzur Y, Amir J |title=Herpetic whitlow infection in a general pediatrician--an occupational hazard |journal=Infection |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=234<U+2013>6 |year=2002 |pmid=12236568 |doi=}}</ref> Again, the HSV seronegative person is at highest risk of acquiring this condition.  Herpes whitlow is also caused by [[autoinoculation]] of HSV into broken skin prior to an infected person developing antibodies against the virus (e.g. during primary infection before seroconversion).<ref name="pmid14677662"/>  It is often observed in thumb-sucking children with primary HSV-1 infection, and in adults aged 20 to 30 following contact with by HSV-2-infected genitals.<ref name="pmid17674583">{{cite journal |author=Wu IB, Schwartz RA |title=Herpetic whitlow |journal=Cutis |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=193<U+2013>6 |year=2007 |pmid=17674583 |doi=}}</ref>

Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include swelling, reddening and tenderness of the skin of infected finger. This may be accompanied by fever and swollen lymph nodes.  Small, clear vesicles initially form that merge and becomes cloudy. Associated pain often seems large relative to the physical symptoms. The herpes whitlow lesion usually heals in two to three weeks.<ref name="pmid5125276">{{cite journal |author= Anonymous|title=Herpetic whitlow: a medical risk |journal=Br Med J |volume=4 |issue=5785 |pages=444 |year=1971 |pmid=5125276 |doi=}}</ref>

===Herpes gladiatorum===
Individuals that participate in [[contact sport]]s such as [[wrestling]], [[rugby]], and [[soccer]] sometimes acquire a condition caused by HSV-1 known as herpes gladiatorum, ''[[scrumpox]]'', ''wrestler<U+2019>s herpes'' or ''mat herpes''.  Abraded skin caused by contacts sports provides an area of entry for HSV-1.  Symptoms present within 2 weeks of direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, and include skin ulceration on the face, ears, and neck.  This disorder may cause fever, headache, sore throat and swollen glands, and occasionally affects the eyes.  Physical symptoms sometimes recur in the skin.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>

Ocular herpes is generally caused by HSV-1 and is a special case of facial herpes infection known as herpes keratitis.  It begins with infection of epithelial cells on the surface of the eye and retrograde infection of nerves serving the [[cornea]].<ref name="pmid11393165">{{cite journal |author=Carr DJ, H<U+00E4>rle P, Gebhardt BM |title=The immune response to ocular herpes simplex virus type 1 infection |journal=Exp.

Additional symptoms include dull pain deep inside the eye, mild to acute dryness and [[sinusitis]]. Most primary infections resolve spontaneously in a few weeks or with the use of oral and topical [[antiviral]]s. However, the virus continues to inhabit the neurons of the eye and to multiply. 

Subsequent recurrences may be more severe, with infected epithelial cells showing larger dendritic ulceration and lesions forming white plaques.<ref name="pmid10858770"/> The epithelial layer is sloughed off as the dendritic ulcer grows and mild inflammation ([[iritis]]) may occur in the underlying [[stroma of iris]]. Sensation loss occurs in lesional areas producing generalised corneal anaesthesia with repeated recurrences.<ref name="pmid10858770"/> This may be accompanied by chronic dry eye, low grade intermittent conjunctivitis or chronic unexplained sinusitis. When the  concentration of viral DNA reaches a critical limit, the presence of the virus can trigger a massive [[autoimmune]] response in the eye, resulting in an individual's immune system destroying the [[Substantia propria|corneal stroma]].<ref name="pmid10858770"/> This usually results in loss of vision due to opacification of the cornea and is a result of an antibody responses against the viral [[antigen]] expression in the stroma following persistent infection.<ref name="pmid10858770"/> This is known as immune-mediated stromal keratitis.

Treatment with [[corneal transplant]]s was once ineffective (with only 14%-61% rate of survival without antiviral therapy), as reinfection of the transplant is common when the virus reactivates. However, with concurrent use of antivirals the chance of graft acceptance has improved.<ref name="pmid12034687">{{cite journal |author=Halberstadt M, Machens M, Gahlenbek KA, B<U+00F6>hnke M, Garweg JG |title=The outcome of corneal grafting in patients with stromal keratitis of herpetic and non-herpetic origin |journal=Br J Ophthalmol |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=646<U+2013>52 |year=2002 |pmid=12034687 |doi=}}</ref>

Although 2 in 3 cases occur in seropositive persons, few of these individuals have history of recurrent orofacial herpes.

Without treatment, HSE results in rapid death in around 70% of cases.<ref name="pmid16675036"/>  Even with the best modern treatment, it is fatal in around 20% of cases treated, and causes serious long-term neurological damage in over half the survivors.  For unknown reasons the virus seems to target the [[temporal lobe]]s of the brain.  Only a small population of survivors (2.5%) regain completely normal brain function.<ref name="pmid11853816"/>  Most individuals with HSE show a decrease in their level of consciousness and an altered mental state presenting as [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and changes in personality.  Increased numbers of white blood cells can be found in their [[cerebrospinal fluid]] without the presence of [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]], and they typically have a fever.<ref name="pmid16675036"/> Some patients with HSE will have seizures.  The electrical activity of the brain (detected using [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], [[Computed tomography|CT]], or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans) changes as the disease progresses, first showing abnormalities in one [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, which spread to the other temporal lobe 7<U+2013>10 days later.<ref name="pmid16675036"/>

[[Infant|Neonatal]] HSV disease is a rare but serious condition, usually the consequence of [[vertical transmission]] of the virus from mother to newborn child, although an estimated 10% of cases may be acquired [[postnatal]]ly from a parent, caretaker, or sibling.

HSV-1 neonatal herpes is extremely rare in [[developing country|developing countries]] because primary exposure to HSV-1 (and therefore development of HSV-1 specific antibodies) usually occurs in childhood or adolescence, precluding a genital HSV-1 infection; HSV-2 infections are much more common in these countries. In industrialized nations the adolescent HSV-1 seroprevalance has been dropping steadily for the last 5 decades as a result of better hygiene, less over-crowding, and smaller family size. The resulting increase in the number of young women entering the sexually active/child bearing years as HSV-1 seronegative, has been a harbinger of increased HSV-1 genital herpes, and as a result, HSV-1 neonatal herpes in developed nations.  A recent three year study in Canada revealed neonatal HSV infections in 5.9 per 100,000 live births. HSV-1 was the cause of 62.5% of cases and 98.7% of transmission was asymptomatic.<ref name=Kropp>{{cite journal

Neonatal herpes manifests itself in three forms: skin, eyes and mouth (SEM) herpes, disseminated (DIS) herpes, and central nervous system (CNS) herpes.<ref name="pmid15685144"/>  SEM herpes is characterized by external lesions but no internal organ involvement, and has the best prognosis. Lesions are likely to appear on trauma sites such as the attachment site of fetal scalp electrodes, forceps or vacuum extractors that are used during delivery, in the margin of the eyes, the [[nasopharynx]], and in areas associated with trauma or surgery (including circumcision).<ref name="pmid12517231"/> DIS herpes affects internal organs, especially the liver. CNS herpes is an infection of the nervous system and the brain that can lead to encephalitis. Infants with CNS herpes present with [[seizure]]s, [[tremor]]s, [[lethargy]], and irritability, they feed poorly, have unstable temperatures, and their [[fontanelle]] (soft spot of the skull) may bulge.<ref name="pmid12517231"/>  CNS herpes is associated with highest [[morbidity]], and DIS herpes has a higher [[mortality]] rate.  Untreated, SEM herpes may spread to the internal organs and cause DIS or CNS herpes resulting in increased mortality and morbidity. Death from neonatal HSV disease in the US is currently decreasing; as high as 85% of HSV infected neonates died a few decades ago whereas the current death rate is about 25%. Reduction in mortality is due to the use of antiviral treatments such as [[vidarabine]] and [[acyclovir]].<ref name="pmid15685144"/><ref name="pmid11269641">{{cite journal |author=Kesson AM |title=Management of neonatal herpes simplex virus infection |journal=Paediatr Drugs |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=81<U+2013>90 |year=2001 |pmid=11269641 |doi=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.merck.com/mmpe/sec19/ch279/ch279h.html The Merck Manual, Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection]</ref><ref name=neonatal>

===Bell's Palsy===
A type of facial [[paralysis]] called [[Bell's palsy]] has been linked to the presence and reactivation of latent HSV-1 inside the sensory nerves of the face known as [[geniculate ganglion|geniculate ganglia]], particularly in a mouse model.<ref name="pmid1336296">{{cite journal |author=Takasu T, Furuta Y, Sato KC, Fukuda S, Inuyama Y, Nagashima K |title=Detection of latent herpes simplex virus DNA and RNA in human geniculate ganglia by the polymerase chain reaction |journal=Acta Otolaryngol. |volume=112 |issue=6 |pages=1004<U+2013>11 |year=1992 |pmid=1336296 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid7598372">{{cite journal |author=Sugita T, Murakami S, Yanagihara N, Fujiwara Y, Hirata Y, Kurata T |title=Facial nerve paralysis induced by herpes simplex virus in mice: an animal model of acute and transient facial paralysis |journal=Ann.

However, since HSV can also be detected in these ganglia in large numbers of individuals that have never experienced facial paralysis, and high titers of antibodies for HSV are not found in HSV-infected individuals with Bell's palsy relative to those without, this theory has been contested.<ref name="pmid15699730">{{cite journal |author=Linder T, Bossart W, Bodmer D |title=Bell's palsy and Herpes simplex virus: fact or mystery? |journal=Otol.

==Recurrences and triggers==
Following active infection, herpes viruses become quiescent to establish a latent infection in sensory and autonomic [[ganglia]] of the nervous system.  The double-stranded DNA of the virus is incorporated into the cell physiology by infection of the [[cell nucleus]] of a nerve's [[Soma (biology)|cell body]].  HSV latency is static - no virus is produced - and is controlled by a number of viral genes including [[HHV LAT|Latency Associated Transcript]] (LAT).<ref name="pmid12409612">{{cite journal |author=Stumpf MP, Laidlaw Z, Jansen VA |title=Herpes viruses hedge their bets |journal=Proc.

The frequency and severity of recurrent outbreaks may vary greatly depending upon the individual.
Outbreaks may occur at the original site of the infection or in close proximity to nerve endings that reach out from the infected ganglia.  In the case of a genital infection, sores can appear near the base of the spine, the buttocks, back of the thighs, or they may appear at the original site of infection. Immunocompromised individuals may experience episodes that are longer, more frequent and more severe. The human body is able to build up an immunity to the virus over time and antiviral medication has been proven to shorten the duration and/or frequency of the outbreaks.<ref name="pmid18192785">{{cite journal |author=Martinez V, Caumes E, Chosidow O |title=Treatment to prevent recurrent genital herpes |journal=Curr Opin Infect Dis |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=42<U+2013>48 |year=2008 |pmid=18192785 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3282f3d9d3}}</ref>

==Transmission and prevention==
Herpes can be contracted through direct contact with an active lesion or body fluid of an infected person.<ref name="titleAHMF: Preventing Sexual Transmission of Genital Herpes">{{cite web |url=http://www.ahmf.com.au/health_professionals/guidelines/preventing_gh_transmission.htm |title=AHMF: Preventing Sexual Transmission of Genital Herpes |accessdate=2008-02-24 |format= |work=}}</ref> Infected people that show no visible symptoms may still shed and transmit virus through their skin, and this asymptomatic shedding may represent the most common form of HSV-2 transmission.<ref name="pmid16238897"/> There are no documented cases of infection via an inanimate object (e.g. a towel, toilet seat, drinking vessels).  To infect a new individual, HSV travels through tiny breaks in the skin or mucous membranes in the mouth or genital areas. Even microscopic abrasions on mucous membranes are sufficient to allow viral entry. Herpes transmission occurs between discordant partners; a person with a history of infection (HSV seropositive) can pass the virus to an HSV seronegative person.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> Antibodies that develop following an initial infection with that type of HSV prevents reinfection with the same herpes type - a person with a history of a cold sore caused by HSV-1 cannot contract a herpes whitlow or genital infection caused by HSV-1. In a [[monogamy|monogamous]] couple, a seronegative female runs a >30% per year risk of contracting an HSV-1 infection from a seropositive male partner. If an oral HSV-1 infection is contracted first, seroconversion will have occurred after 6 weeks to provide protective antibodies against a future genital HSV-1 infection.

[[Image:Kondom.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Barrier protection, such as a condom, can reduce the risk of herpes transmission in some cases]]
For genital herpes, [[condom]]s are a highly effective in limiting transmission of herpes simplex infection.<ref name=Wald>{{cite journal | author=Wald A, Langenberg AG, Link K, Izu AE, Ashley R, Warren T, Tyring S, Douglas JM Jr, Corey L. | title=Effect of condoms on reducing the transmission of herpes simplex virus type 2 from men to women | journal=JAMA | year=2001 | pages=3100-3106 | volume=285 | issue=24 | id=PMID 11427138}}</ref><ref name=Casper>{{cite journal | author=Casper C, Wald A. | title=Condom use and the prevention of genital herpes acquisition. | journal=Herpes | year=2002 | pages=10-14 | volume=9 | issue=1 | id=PMID 11916494}}</ref>  However, condoms are by no means completely effective.  The virus cannot get through latex, but their effectiveness is somewhat limited on a [[public health]] scale by the limited use of condoms in the community,<ref name=Visser>{{cite journal | author=de Visser RO, Smith AM, Rissel CE, Richters J, Grulich AE. | title=Sex in Australia: safer sex and condom use among a representative sample of adults | journal=Aust.

In such cases, abstinence from sexual activity, or washing of the genitals after sex, is recommended. The use of condoms or [[dental dams]] also limits the transmission of herpes from the genitals of one partner to the mouth of the other (or vice versa) during [[oral sex]].  When one partner has herpes simplex infection and the other does not, the use of antiviral medication, such as [[valaciclovir]], in conjunction with a  condom, further decreases the chances of transmission to the uninfected partner.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  Topical [[microbicide]]s contain chemicals that directly inactivate the virus and block viral entry are currently being investigated.<ref name="pmid18156035"/> [[Vaccines]] for HSV are currently undergoing trials. Once developed, they may be used to help with prevention or minimize initial infections as well as treatment for existing infections. <ref>{{cite news   | last =Seppa  | first =Nathan  | title =One-Two Punch: Vaccine fights herpes with antibodies, T cells  | pages =5  | language =English  | publisher =Science News  | date=  2005-01-05 | url =http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20050101/fob6.asp  | accessdate = 2007-03-29}}</ref>

As with almost all sexually transmited infections, women are more susceptible to acquiring genital HSV-2 than men.<ref> {{cite news | author=Carla K. Johnson | title=Percentage of people with herpes drops | url=http://www.newsobserver.com/150/story/477928.html | publisher=Associated Press | date=  August 23, 2006}}</ref> On an annual basis, without the use of antivirals or condoms, the transmission risk of HSV-2 from infected male to female is approximately 8-10%. This is believed to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is approximately 4-5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios by about 50%, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom free. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk by 50%. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male to female transmission than vice-versa. <ref name=Wald/> The effects of combining antiviral and condom use is roughly additive, thus resulting in approximately a 75% combined reduction in annual transmission risk. These figures reflect experiences with subjects having frequently-recurring genital herpes (>6 recurrences per year). Subjects with low recurrence rates and those with no clinical manifestations were excluded from these studies. 

To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1 seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV, are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect [[caesarean section]] to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>  The use of antiviral treatments, such as aciclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.<ref name="pmid18156035"/>

HSV seropositive individuals practising unprotected sex with HIV positive persons pose a high risk of [[HIV]] transmission, and are even more susceptible to HIV during an outbreak with active sores.<ref name="pmid18186706">{{cite journal |author=Koelle DM, Corey L |title=Herpes Simplex: Insights on Pathogenesis and Possible Vaccines |journal=Annu Rev Med |volume=59 |issue= |pages=381<U+2013>395 |year=2008 |pmid=18186706 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.59.061606.095540}}</ref>

==Asymptomatic shedding==

HSV asymptomatic [[viral shedding|shedding]] occurs at some time in most individuals infected with herpes. It is believed to occur on 2.9% of days while on antiviral therapy, versus 10.8% of days without and is estimated to account for one third of the total days of viral shedding.<ref name="pmid16238897"/> Asymptomatic shedding is more frequent within the first 12 months of acquiring HSV, and concurrent infection with [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|HIV]] also increases the frequency and duration of asymptomatic shedding.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kim H, Meier A, Huang M, Kuntz S, Selke S, Celum C, Corey L, Wald A | title = Oral herpes simplex virus type 2 reactivation in HIV-positive and -negative men. | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 194 | issue = 4 | pages = 420-7 | year = 2006 | id = PMID 16845624}}</ref> It can occur more than a week before or after a symptomatic recurrence in 50% of cases.<ref name="pmid16238897"/> There are some indications that some individuals may have much lower patterns of shedding, but evidence supporting this is not fully verified - no significant differences are seen in the frequency of asymptomatic shedding when comparing persons with 1 to 12 annual recurrences to those that have no recurrences.<ref name="pmid16238897"/>

==Diagnosis==

Primary orofacial herpes is readily identified by clinical examination in persons without a previous history of lesions, and with reported contact with an individual with known HSV-1 infection. The appearance and distribution of sores, in these individuals, typically presents as multiple, round, and superficial oral ulcers, accompanied by acute [[gingivitis]].<ref name="pmid17939933">{{cite journal |author=Fatahzadeh M, Schwartz RA |title=Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management |journal=J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=737<U+2013>63; quiz 764<U+2013>6 |year=2007 |pmid=17939933 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2007.06.027}}</ref> Adults with non-typical presentation are more difficult to diagnose. However, prodromal symptoms that occur before the appearance of herpetic lesions helps to differentiate HSV symptoms from the similar symptoms of, for example, [[allergy|allergic]] [[stomatitis]].  Occasionally,  when lesions do not appear inside the mouth, primary orofacial herpes is mistaken for a bacterial [[infection]] known as [[impetigo]]. Common mouth ulcers ([[aphthous ulcer]]), also  resemble intraoral herpes, but do not present a vesicular stage.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>

Genital herpes can be more difficult to diagnose than oral herpes since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical signs and symptoms.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>  To confuse diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including [[lichen planus]], [[atopic dermatitis]], or [[urethritis]].<ref name="pmid17939933"/> [[Laboratory]] testing is, therefore, often used to confirm genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, [[direct fluorescent antibody]] (DFA) studies to detect virus, [[skin biopsy]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to test for presence of viral DNA. A [[Tzanck test]] (or smear), can also be performed although this cannot differentiate between herpes simplex or varicella ([[chicken pox]]) (the primary infection of varicella zoster virus (VZV or [[shingles]]). Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.<ref name="pmid17939933"/> [[Serology|Serological]] tests for antibodies to HSV are rarely useful to diagnosis but are important in epidemiological studies. Serologic assays cannot differentiate between antibodies generated in response to a genital versus an oral HSV infection and as such cannot confirm the site of infection. Absence of antibody to HSV-2 does not exclude gential infection because of the increasing incidence of genital infections caused by HSV-1. For these reasons and the diagnostic delay; serology is not routinely used in clinical practice<ref name="pmid17939933"/>

==Epidemiology==

Although many people infected with HSV develop labial or genital lesions, many more are either undiagnosed or display no physical symptoms - individuals with no symptoms are described as asymptomatic or with [[Subclinical infection|subclinical]] herpes.<ref name="pmid11095834">{{cite journal |author=Handsfield HH |title=Public Health Strategies to Prevent Genital Herpes: Where Do We Stand? |journal=Curr Infect Dis Rep |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25<U+2013>30 |year=2000 |pmid=11095834 |doi=}}</ref> Since asymptomatic individuals are often are unaware of their infection, they are considered at high risk for spreading HSV.

===Europe===
Large differences in HSV-1 seroprevalence are seen in different [[Europe|European countries]]. HSV-1 seroprevalence is high in [[Bulgaria]] (83.9%) and The [[Czech Republic]] (80.6%) and lower in [[Belgium]] (67.4%), The [[Netherlands]] (56.7%) and [[Finland]] (52.4%).<ref name="pmid15170000"/>  The typical age at which HSV-1 infection is acquired ranges from 5<U+2013>9 years in [[Eastern Europe]]an countries like Bulgaria and the Czech Republic to over 25 years of age in [[Northern Europe]]an countries such as Finland, The Netherlands, [[Germany]], and [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Young adults in Northern European countries are less likely to be infected with HSV-1.  However, European women are more likely to be HSV-1 seropositive than men.<ref name="pmid15170000"/>
HSV-2 seropositivity is widely distributed in Europeans older than 12, although there are large differences in the percentage of the population that had been exposed to HSV-2.  Bulgaria has a high (23.9%) HSV-2 seroprevalence relative to other European countries: Germany (13.9%), Finland (13.4%),
Belgium (11.1%), The Netherlands (8.8%), the Czech Republic (6.0%) and England and Wales (4.2%).<ref name="pmid15170000"/> Women are more likely to be seropositive than men, and likely acquire the virus at an earlier age.  In each country of Europe, HSV-2 seropositivity becomes more common from adolescence onwards and increases in the population with age, with a decline in the older age groups in some countries.<ref name="pmid15170000"/>

===North America===
''United States''

In healthy adults,  HSV-2 infection occurs more frequently in the [[USA]] than in Europe, and appears to be increasing; in individuals over 12 years old, HSV-2 seroprevalence has increased from 16.4% in 1976 to 21.8% from in 1994 and is still rising.<ref name="pmid15115626">{{cite journal |author=Malkin JE |title=Epidemiology of genital herpes simplex virus infection in developed countries |journal=Herpes |volume=11 Suppl 1 |issue= |pages=2A<U+2013>23A |year=2004 |pmid=15115626 |doi=}}</ref> Thus, the current incidence of genital herpes caused by HSV-2 in the U.S. is roughly one in four or five adults, with approximately 50 million people infected with genital herpes and an estimated 0.5 million new genital herpes infections occurring each year.<ref name="pmid17939933"/>  [[African American]]s appear more susceptible to HSV-2, although the presence of active genital symptoms are more likely in [[White American|Caucasian Americans]].  The largest increase in HSV-2 acquisition during the past few years is in white adolescents.  People with many lifetime sexual partners and those who are sexually active from a young age are also at higher-risk for the transmission of HSV-2 in the U.S.<ref name = "ummc">{{cite web | url =http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/who_gets_herpes_simplex_virus_000052_4.htm

Women are at higher risk than men for acquiring HSV-2 infection, and the chance of being infected increases with age.<ref name="pmid17939933"/> 

African Americans and immigrants from [[developing country|developing countries]] typically have an HSV-1 seroprevalance in their adolescent population that is two or three times higher than that of [[White American|Caucasian Americans]], possibly reflecting differences in their [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] backgrounds.<ref name="pmid17939933"/> Many white Americans enter sexual activity, marriage and child bearing years seronegative for HSV-1. The absence of antibodies from a prior oral HSV-1 infection leaves these individuals susceptible to primary HSV-1 genital infections. This brings with it a risk of vertical transmission to the neonate if the mother contracts a primary infection during the third trimester of pregnancy. A seronegative mother has up to a 57% chance of conveying an HSV infection to her baby during childbirth whereas a woman seropositive for both HSV-1 and HSV-2 has around a 1-3% chance of passing reactivated virus to her infant. Women that are`seropositive for only one type of HSV fall  somewhere in between but are still only half as likely to transmit HSV as a seronegative mother. Genital infection caused by HSV-1, in the U.S, is now thought to be about 50% and contributes to a rate of 6 to 20 per 100,000 live births in the U.S. depending on region and demographics. <ref name=Elliot>{{cite journal

''Canada''

Following a study in [[Ontario]], up to 55% of [[Canadian]]s age of 15 to 16, and 89% of individuals in their early forties are estimated have antibodies to HSV-1. Teenagers are less likely to be seropositive for HSV-2 - antibodies against this virus is only found in 0-3.8% of 15-16 year olds.  However, 21% of individuals in their early forties have antibodies against HSV-2 reflecting the sexually transmitted nature of this virus. When standardising for age, HSV-2 seroprevalence in Ontario, for individuals between the ages of 15 to 44, was 9.1%.

Currently, there is no treatment that can eradicate any of the herpes viruses from the body. Non-prescription [[analgesic]]s can reduce pain and fever during initial outbreaks.  Topical anesthetic treatment (such as [[prilocaine]], [[lidocaine]] or [[tetracaine]]) can relieve itching and pain.<ref name="pmid3147021">{{cite journal |author= |title=Local anesthetic creams |journal=BMJ |volume=297 |issue=6661 |pages=1468 |year=1988 |pmid=3147021 |doi=}}</ref><ref name="pmid10570387">{{cite journal |author=Kaminester LH, Pariser RJ, Pariser DM, ''et al'' |title=A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of topical tetracaine in the treatment of herpes labialis |journal=J.

===Antiviral Medication===
[[Antiviral drug|Antiviral medications]] used against herpes viruses work by interfering with [[viral replication]], effectively slowing the replication rate of the virus and providing a greater opportunity for the immune response to intervene. All drugs in this class depend on the activity of the viral [[enzyme]], [[thymidine kinase]], to convert the drug sequentially from its [[prodrug]] form to a monophosphate (with one [[phosphate]] group), diphosphate (with two phosphate groups) and, finally, triphosphate (with three phosphate groups) form that interferes with viral [[DNA replication]].<ref name="pmid16284630">{{cite journal |author=De Clercq E, Field HJ |title=Antiviral prodrugs - the development of successful prodrug strategies for antiviral chemotherapy |journal=Br. J. Pharmacol. |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=1<U+2013>11 |year=2006 |pmid=16284630 |doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0706446}}</ref>

There are several prescription [[antiviral]] medications for controlling herpes simplex outbreaks, including [[aciclovir]] (''Zovirax''), [[valaciclovir]] (''Valtrex''), [[famciclovir]] (''Famvir''), and [[penciclovir]]. [[Aciclovir]] was the original and prototypical member of this drug class and  is now available in generic brands at a greatly reduced cost. Valaciclovir and famciclovir are prodrugs of aciclovir and penciclovir respectively, which have improved solubility in water and better [[bioavailability]] when taken orally.<ref name="pmid16284630"/>  [[Aciclovir]] is the recommended antiviral for suppressive therapy in the last months of pregnancy to prevent transmission of herpes simplex to the [[neonate]].<ref name="Leung">{{cite journal

Pharmacother. | year=2003 | pages=1809-1819 | volume=4 | issue=10 | id=PMID 14521490}}</ref>  The use of [[valaciclovir]] and [[famciclovir]], while potentially improving treatment compliance and efficacy, are still undergoing safety evaluation in this context. There is evidence in mice that treatment with famciclovir, rather than aciclovir, during an initial outbreak can help lower the incidence of future outbreaks by reducing the amount of latent virus in the neural ganglia. This potential effect on latency over aciclovir drops to zero a few months post-infection.<ref name=Thackray>{{cite journal

===Topical treatments===
[[Docosanol]] is available as a cream for direct application to the affected area of skin. It prevents HSV from fusing to cell membranes, thus barring the entry of the virus into the skin. Docosanol was approved for use after clinical trials by the [[FDA]] in July 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title = Drug Name: ABREVA (docosanol) - approval | work = | publisher = centerwatch.com | date = July 2000 | url = http://www.centerwatch.com/patient/drugs/dru627.html| format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-17 }}</ref>  Marketed by Avanir Pharmaceuticals under the brand name ''Abreva'', it was the first [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[antiviral drug]] approved for sale in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] and  was the subject of a US nationwide class-action suit in [[March, 2007]] due to the misleading claim that it cut recovery times in half.<ref>{{cite web | title = California Court Upholds Settlement Of Class Action Over Cold Sore Medicationl | work = | publisher = BNA Inc. | date = July 2000 | url = http://subscript.bna.com/SAMPLES/plp.nsf/85256269004a991e8525611300214487/29d5bb623a50fd25852572ad0074f772?OpenDocument | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-10-17 }}</ref> [[Tromantadine]] is available as a gel that inhibits entry and spreading of the virus by altering the surface composition of skin cells and inhibiting release of viral genetic material. Zilactin is a topical [[analgesic]] barrier treatment, which forms a "shield" at the area of application to prevents a sore from increasing in size and decrease viral spreading during the healing process.

===Other drugs===
[[Cimetidine]], a common component of [[heartburn]] medication, has been shown to lessen the severity of [[herpes zoster]] outbreaks in several different instances, and offered some relief from herpes simplex.<ref name=kapinska> 
Another treatment, if not very medical, is the use of vaseline, or any other type of fat. This will ban water, or saliva, from reaching the cold sore. as the cold sore "feeds" itself from water, this will end its existence in a day or two.

}}</ref> These compounds also reduce the rate, but not the extent, at which valaciclovir is converted into aciclovir.

Limited evidence suggests that low dose [[aspirin]] (125 mg daily) might be beneficial in patients with recurrent HSV infections.  Aspirin (also called acetylsalicylic acid) is an [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]], which reduces the level of [[prostaglandin]]s - naturally occurring lipid compounds - that are essential in creating [[inflammation]].<ref name=Karadi>

===Vaccines===
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in the [[United States]] is currently in the midst of [[Clinical trial|phase III trials]] of a vaccine against HSV-2, called [[Herpevac]].<ref name="titleHerpevac Trial for Women">{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/herpevac/ |title=Herpevac Trial for Women |accessdate=2008-02-25 |format= |work=}}</ref> The vaccine has only been shown to be effective for women who have never been exposed to HSV-1. Overall, the vaccine is approximately 48% effective in preventing HSV-2 seropositivity and about 78% effective in preventing symptomatic HSV-2.<ref name="titleHerpevac Trial for Women">{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/stds/herpevac/studyover_faqs.htm |title=Herpevac Trial for Women |accessdate=2008-03-04 |format= |work=}}</ref> Assuming FDA approval, a commercial version of the vaccine is estimated to become available around 2008. During initial trials, the vaccine did not exhibit any evidence in preventing HSV-2 in males.<ref name="titleHerpevac Trial for Women"/>  Additionally, the vaccine only reduced the acquisition of HSV-2 and symptoms due to newly acquired HSV-2 among women who did not have HSV-2 infection at the time they got the vaccine.<ref name="titleHerpevac Trial for Women"/>   Because about 20% of persons in the United States have HSV-2 infection, this further reduces the population for whom this vaccine might be appropriate.<ref name="titleHerpevac Trial for Women"/>

Certain [[dietary supplement]]s and [[Complementary and alternative medicine|alternative remedies]] are believed beneficial in the treatment of herpes when used in conjunction with conventional antiviral therapy.

==Psychological and social effects==

Since there is currently no cure for herpes, some people experience negative feelings related to the condition following diagnosis, particularly if they have acquired the genital form of the disease.  Though these feelings lessen over time, they can include depression, fear of rejection, feelings of isolation, fear of being found out, self-destructive feelings, and fear of masturbation.<ref name=Vezina>{{cite journal | author=Vezina C, Steben M. | title=Genital Herpes: Psychosexual Impacts and Counselling | journal=The Canadian Journal of CME | year=2001 | pages=125-134 | volume= | issue=June | id=}}</ref> In order to improve the well-being of people with herpes, support groups have been formed in the United States and the UK, providing supporting communities and information about herpes of message forums and dating websites.<ref>[http://www.herpes-coldsores.com/support/herpes.htm Herpes Support Groups & Clinics]</ref><ref>[http://www.herpes.org.uk Herpes Viruses Association - a patient run group] </ref><ref>[http://www.herpes-coldsores.com/messageforum Herpes message forum with over 4000 members] </ref><ref>[http://www.h-date.com H-Date, a dating site for persons with either or both of HSV-1 or HSV-2]</ref><ref>[http://www.mpwh.net/ MPwH - Meeting People with Herpes, a dating site with over 65000 members]</ref>

People with the herpes virus are often hesitant to divulge to other people, including friends and family, that they are infected.  This is especially true of new or potential sexual partners that they consider 'casual'.<ref name=Green>{{cite journal | author=Green J, Ferrier S, Kocsis A, Shadrick J, Ukoumunne OC, Murphy S, Hetherton J. | title=Determinants of disclosure of genital herpes to partners. | journal=Sex. Transm. Infect. | year=2003 | pages=42-44 | volume=79 | issue=1 | id=PMID 12576613}}</ref> A perceived reaction is sometimes taken into account before making a decision about whether to inform new partners and at what point in the relationship. Many people choose not to disclose their herpes status when they first begin dating someone, but wait until it later becomes clear that they are moving towards a sexual relationship. Other people disclose their herpes status upfront.  Still others choose only to date other people who already have herpes.

==Legal redress==
Whether the law can help a person who catches herpes depends on the [[jurisdiction]] where it was contracted as legal jurisdictions define their own rules regarding the transmission of STIs such as herpes.<ref>[http://www.genital-herpes-corner.com/herpes-and-the-law.html Webpage on social aspects of genital herpes]</ref> There can be both criminal and civil possibilities. For example, in the criminal case of R. v. Sullivan heard in [[England and Wales]], an attempt was made to prosecute Sullivan for [[sexual assault]] after his partner experienced a primary outbreak of genital herpes, on the basis that he had failed to reveal the fact that he had herpes. The presiding judge dismissed the prosecution case during preliminary hearings, citing inability to prove prior knowledge and the trial did not take place.<ref name="title">{{cite web
