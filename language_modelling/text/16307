'''''TouchTone''''' is a 2015 [[puzzle video game]] for [[iOS]] devices by [[Mikengreg]], a two-person indie game development team made up of Mike Boxleiter and [[Greg Wohlwend]]. The player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The player unlocks chains of emails by completing a series of puzzles wherein a beam is reflected around a room to a set destination. ''TouchTone''{{'s}} core concept grew from a two-day [[game jam]] immediately following their 2012 release of ''[[Gasketball]]'', but only found its [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] theme following the mid-2013 [[Edward Snowden]] [[global surveillance disclosures (2013<U+2013>present)|global surveillance disclosures]]. The tone of ''TouchTone''{{'s}} story grew from satirical to serious over the course of the game's development.

The game was released on March 19, 2015. [[Review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]] characterized ''TouchTone''{{'s}} reviews as generally favorable. Critics praised the game's visual style and story, but criticized the way the game did not allow players to skip puzzles. Reviewers found the light-bending puzzle premise unoriginal, but appreciated its thematic connection.

As part of a [[government surveillance]] program, the player monitors phone calls to find public threats. Apart from infrequent interaction with their handler, the player is left to solve puzzles in pursuit of one such lead. The puzzles are based on the "reflection puzzle" popularized by [[role-playing video games]] wherein the player moves mirrors to refract a beam of light about a room. In ''TouchTone'', the player swipes the screen to move pieces that redirect incoming beams, symbolic of phone signals, into specific locations. The waveform beams are displayed in different solid colors and must be matched with the destination "node" of the same color by passing through moveable pieces that reflect and split the beam.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> The pieces do not move individually but as rows and columns in [[cardinal directions]].<ref name="Polygon: preview"/>

The [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] are displayed in an [[overworld]] with a branching, [[tree structure]]. The player must pursue multiple branches to further the story. Optional, side-story branches do not advance the main plot but have the hardest puzzles.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> The story is told through chains of emails, which are unlocked by completing puzzles. The player assumes the role of an American Muslim [[National Security Agency]] agent who determines whether the [[hacker (computer security)|hacked]] emails are pertinent to national security. The [[ethical dilemma|ethics]] of government surveillance are a core theme of the game.<ref name="Wired: Spook"/>{{-}}

[[Mikengreg]], an [[indie game developer]] duo of Mike Boxleiter and [[Greg Wohlwend]], released the 2010 ''[[Solipskier]]'' and 2012 ''[[Gasketball]]'' together before ''TouchTone'' in 2015.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> After ''Gasketball''{{'s}} release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a [[game jam]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. ''Gasketball'' turned out to be a "financial flop", and so Boxleiter wanted to use the jam to create "something new, ... something really small and perfect".<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> By the end of the two-day jam, the core mirror reflection mechanics of ''TouchTone'' were in place, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> During this time, the two also worked separately, and Wohlwend released the well-received ''[[Threes]]'' with [[Asher Vollmer]] in 2014.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> Wohlwend tried to fit [[audio signal]] elements into ''TouchTone''{{'s}} nascent theme of light, lasers, and prisms.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> They felt this direction was unsuccessful, like a "boring [[Flash game]]", and that the game too closely mimicked "a hacking [[minigame]] from a bigger [[Triple A (video gaming)|AAA]] game like ''[[BioShock]]'' or ''[[System Shock]]''".<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/>

''TouchTone'' found its theme following the [[Edward Snowden]] [[global surveillance disclosures (2013<U+2013>present)|global surveillance disclosures]] in mid 2013, as Mikengreg felt they could provide satirical commentary through the "hacking" element of the game.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> The story shed its jocular tone as it and its political content grew deeper and more serious.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> Boxleiter wrote most of the script, which totaled over 20,000 words in length. It was his first effort at professional writing, and it took him five months. He and Wohlwend would conference after each chapter for coherency. Boxleiter wanted the story to explore the "questions ... floating around the national consciousness" rather than be "heavy-handed" and prescriptive.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> Despite this work, Boxleiter felt that the story and the gameplay "don't necessarily interact with each other", with the story serving to drive those less interested in puzzles through the rest of the game.<ref name="Polygon: preview"/> They [[playtest]]ed the game in public at the theater in [[Logan Square, Chicago]], though they acknowledged difficulty in playtesting the story's private experience.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/> Mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles, which they felt would spoil the game and the player's capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty. They attribute this [[game design]] philosophy to [[Derek Yu]] of ''[[Spelunky]]''.<ref name="Polygon: preview"/>

''TouchTone'' was released as an [[iOS]] universal app for both [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] on March 19, 2015.<ref name="Pocket Gamer preview"/> It received a front page feature on the [[iOS App Store]] upon its release.<ref name="TouchArcade interview"/>{{-}}

''TouchTone'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to video game [[review score aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=Metacritic/> It received ''Pocket Gamer''{{'s}} silver award.<ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/>

Reviewers praised the game's aesthetics and criticized its unoriginal puzzle concept.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/><ref name="148Apps review"/> ''TouchArcade''{{'s}} Shaun Musgrave wrote that the game's "striking" visuals and "politically charged" message were not completely reconciled but were "individually strong".<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> He described its art style as similar to Wohlwend's previous work and its political statement as indicative of Mikengreg's strong opinions. Musgrave praised the game's writing but thought the actual puzzles were weaker.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> ''148Apps''{{'s}} Jordan Minor found the "clinical, minimally-colored cyberspace" and 1970s [[thriller film]] aesthetic "chillingly appropriate" for the theme's tension.<ref name="148Apps review"/> He also chided the puzzles for not being "a reward unto themselves" and the gameplay's "monotony" for being similar to that of ''[[Papers, Please]]'' without serving the same dehumanizing point.<ref name="148Apps review"/> Minor called ''TouchTone'' "essentially a series of the hacking minigames ... [from] ''[[BioShock]]'', ''[[Deus Ex]]'', or ''[[Watch Dogs]]''."<ref name="148Apps review"/> ''Pocket Gamer''{{'s}} Craig Grannell appreciate how the game "often forces a kind of upside-down thinking" and compared its message to that of ''[[Blackbar]]''.<ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/> ''[[Gamezebo]]''{{'s}} Jim Squires said that ''TouchTone'' is "perfectly designed for a certain set of mobile gamers" and compared its gameplay to the 1987 ''[[Deflektor]]''.<ref name="Gamezebo review"/> Despite the game's similarity to "countless light-bending puzzle games", he found Mikengreg's implementation "fiendishly clever" in the way the player moves rows of tiles rather than one at a time.<ref name="Gamezebo review"/>

Reviewers did not like the inability to skip puzzles.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/><ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/><ref name="Gamezebo review"/> Musgrave wrote that moments of being "stuck on a mandatory stage" detracted from the player's investment and sense of immersion in the story.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/> Grannell of ''Pocket Gamer'' wrote that ''TouchTone''{{'s}} linearity was its "only downside", though he also wished for options to "undo" mid-game choices and to save puzzle progress upon leaving the game.<ref name="Pocket Gamer review"/> Multiple reviewers appreciated the game's story.<ref name="TouchArcade review"/><ref name="Gamezebo review"/><ref name="Wired: Spook"/><ref name="Polygon: preview"/> ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'s}} Kyle Vanhemert felt that the act of determining whether messages were pertinent to national security was a "powerful experience".<ref name="Wired: Spook"/> Squires of ''Gamezebo'' considered the story one of the game's strong points, and unusually so for a puzzle game. He wrote that there was sufficient "intrigue" to want to finish the story, and that the reward of more story encouraged him to get through the harder puzzles.<ref name="Gamezebo review"/>
