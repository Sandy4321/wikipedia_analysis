[[File:Princess Astrid engaged in 1926.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Engagement of Princess Astrid and [[Leopold III of Belgium|Crown Prince Leopold]] on 21 September 1926]]

'''Astrid of Sweden''' (Astrid Sofia Lovisa Thyra of Sweden; 17 November 1905 <U+2013> 29 August 1935) was [[List of Belgian consorts|Queen of the Belgians]] as the wife of King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]].

==Early life==
Princess Astrid of Sweden was born in [[Stockholm]] on 17 November 1905. She was the niece of King [[Gustav V of Sweden]], since she was the youngest daughter of the king's brother, [[Prince Carl, Duke of V<U+00E4>sterg<U+00F6>tland]], and his wife, [[Princess Ingeborg of Denmark]]. Astrid's paternal grandfather was King [[Oscar II of Sweden]] and her maternal grandfather was King [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]]. Astrid's sister, [[Princess M<U+00E4>rtha of Sweden|Princess M<U+00E4>rtha]], married the future King [[Olav V of Norway]]. Her eldest sister, [[Princess Margaretha of Sweden]] married [[Prince Axel of Denmark]], while her only brother [[Prince Carl, Duke of <U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]], married [[Morganatic marriage|morganatically]].

==Marriage==
In [[Stockholm]], on 4 November 1926 civilly and religiously in [[Brussels]] on 10 November, Princess Astrid married Crown Prince Leopold of Belgium, the son of King [[Albert I of Belgium]] and his wife, [[Elisabeth of Bavaria (1876<U+2013>1965)|Queen Elisabeth]], born Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. It was a happy and devoted marriage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Astrid was enthusiastically adopted by the Belgians. She was widely loved for her beauty, charm and simplicity. In 1927, Leopold and Astrid had a daughter, [[Princess Jos<U+00E9>phine-Charlotte of Belgium|Princess Josephine-Charlotte]], and in 1930, their first son, [[Baudouin I of Belgium|Prince Baudouin]] (who eventually succeeded his father as [[King of the Belgians]]).

==Conversion to Catholicism==
Raised as a [[Lutheran]], Astrid converted to [[Catholicism]] after marrying Prince Leopold. She had initially considered converting to Catholicism, simply because it was the religion of Belgium, but the priest she consulted told her not to do so until she genuinely believed it was the true religion (See'' More Joy Than Pain'', 1991, by Lars Rooth pp.&nbsp;84<U+2013>85)
Astrid learned more about Catholicism and, several years later, in 1930, converted from genuine conviction. Her decision made her happy, and she confided to a close childhood friend: <U+201C>My soul has found peace"(quoted by Anna Sparre in ''Astrid mon amie'', 2005, p.&nbsp;128) Her father-in-law, King Albert, who was very devout himself, repeated, on the day of Astrid's conversion: "I am glad, very glad. Now all the family is united in the same religion" (quoted by Charles d'Ydewalle in ''Albert and the Belgians: Portrait of a King'', 2005, p.&nbsp;259).

==Queen==
On February 17, 1934, King Albert died in a mountain-climbing accident in Marche-les-Dames, Belgium. Leopold and Astrid became the new King and Queen of the Belgians.  Later that year, the third child of Leopold and Astrid was born. He was named [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert]] after his grandfather, and would eventually succeed his brother Baudouin as [[King of the Belgians]].

As Queen, Astrid dedicated her time to raising her family and promoting social causes. She was very concerned with the situation of women, children, and the disadvantaged. During an economic crisis in Belgium in 1935, she organized a collection of clothing and food for the poor. She did this through an open letter, which was published as the <U+201C>Queen<U+2019>s Appeal<U+201D>.

==Death==
[[File:Astridkapelle.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Astrid chapel in Switzerland]]
Tragically, at age 29, Queen Astrid was killed in a [[car accident]] in the mountains, at [[K<U+00FC>ssnacht am Rigi]], near [[Lake Lucerne]], [[Schwyz]], Switzerland, on 29 August 1935. She was deeply mourned by her husband, King Leopold, by the Belgians, and by the Swedes. Belgium issued a particularly beautiful [[postage stamp]] showing her portrait in black, known as the ''Astrid Mourning'' issue.  A commemorative chapel was built in Switzerland at the site of the crash.

Queen Astrid is interred in the royal vault at the [[Church of Our Lady of Laeken]], Brussels, beside her husband, King Leopold III of the Belgians, and his second wife, [[Princess Lilian of Belgium]].
