'''S/2012 (134340) 1'''{{efn|134340 is Pluto's [[Minor Planet Center]] number, assigned following its [[Pluto#2006: IAU classification|demotion]] from full planetary status in 2006.<ref name="Than" />}} (also informally known as '''P5''') is a small [[natural satellite]] of [[Pluto]] whose discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. It is the fifth confirmed satellite of Pluto, and was found approximately one year after [[S/2011 (134340) 1]] (or "P4"), Pluto's fourth discovered satellite. The moon is estimated to have a diameter of between {{convert|10|and|25|km|sp=us|0}}, and orbital period of 20.2 days.

== Discovery ==
The satellite designated S/2012 (134340) 1 was discovered by a team led by astronomer [[Mark R. Showalter]], using fourteen sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by the [[Wide Field Camera 3]] fitted to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].<ref name="dailymail 2012-07-11"/><ref name="IAUCirc">{{cite journal|last=Showalter|first=M.R.|coauthors=Weaver, H. A.; Stern, S. A.; Steffl, A. J.; Buie, M. W.; Merline, W. J.; Mutchler, M. J.; Soummer, R.; Throop, H. B.|date=2012|title=New Satellite of (134340) Pluto: S/2012 (134340) 1|journal=IAU Circular|volume=9253|pages=1|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012IAUC.9253....1S (abstract only)}}</ref>  The discovery was announced on 11 July 2012. The new moon is about half as bright as the dimmest previously known object in the system, P4, and about one hundred thousandth as bright as Pluto.<ref name="Matson" /> It is designated S/2012 (134340) 1,<ref name="nasa 2012-07-11" /> and informally referred to as P5.<ref name="Matson" /><ref name="chang" /><ref name="guardian 2012-07-11" />

The survey work leading to the moon's discovery was in preparation for the mission of the ''[[New Horizons]]'' space probe, currently en route to the Pluto system with flyby scheduled for 14 July 2015. The discovery of another small Plutonian moon has heightened concerns that this region of space may harbor more bodies too small to be detected, raising fears that the probe may be damaged by an uncharted body or [[planetary ring|ring]] as it traverses the system at a speed of over 13&nbsp;km/sec.<ref name="Sanders 2012-07-11" /><ref name="csmonitor 2012-07-11" /> Tiny moons, such as Saturn's moon [[Pallene (moon)|Pallene]], tend to be associated with tenuous rings or arcs, because their gravity is unable to hold on to material ejected by meteoroid impacts; such diffuse material represents the chief navigational hazard.<ref name="Redd" /> Current plans call for ''New Horizons'' to pass just inside the orbit of the innermost moon, [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], but this could be changed if observations or modeling suggest a potential threat.<ref name="Lakdawalla" />

== Origin ==
The unexpectedly complex moon system around Pluto may be the result of a collision between Pluto and another sizable [[Kuiper belt]] object in the distant past.<ref name="latimes 2012-07-11" /> Pluto's moons may have [[Collisional family|coalesced from the debris]] from such an event, similar to the [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant impact]] thought to have created the Earth's Moon. The orbital resonances may have acted as "ruts" to gather material from the smashup.<ref name="Matson" />

== Physical properties ==
The moon is estimated to have a diameter of between {{convert|10|and|25|km|sp=us|0}}.<ref name="hubblesite 2012-07-11" /><ref name="BBC 2012-07-11" /> These figures are inferred from the [[apparent magnitude]] of the moon and by using an estimated [[albedo]] of 0.35 and 0.04 for the lower and upper bounds, respectively.<ref name="Sanders 2012-07-11" /> Because of its small size, the moon is likely to be irregular in shape.<ref name="hubblesite 2012-07-11" /> It is thought to have formed from the debris lofted by a collision, which would have led to losses of the more [[Volatiles|volatile ices]], such as those of [[nitrogen]] and [[Methane clathrate|methane]], in the composition of the impactors. This process is expected to have created a body consisting mainly of [[Ice|water ice]].<ref name="APOD" />

== Orbital properties ==
P5 orbits the Pluto-Charon [[barycenter]] at a distance of about 42,000&nbsp;km,<ref name="Sanders 2012-07-11" /> putting it between the orbits of Charon and [[Nix (moon)|Nix]]. All of [[Moons of Pluto|Pluto's moons]] appear to travel in orbits that are very nearly circular and coplanar, described by P5's discoverer Mark Showalter as "neatly nested ... a bit like [[Matryoshka doll|Russian dolls]]".<ref name="latimes 2012-07-11" /> Its orbital period is estimated to be 20.2 <U+00B1> 0.1 days,<ref name="Sanders 2012-07-11" /> a value about 5.4% from a 1:3 [[orbital resonance|mean motion resonance]] with the Charon<U+2013>Pluto orbital period of 6.387 days. With the other moons Nix, [[S/2011 (134340) 1|P4]] and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]], it forms part of a remarkable 1:3:4:5:6 sequence of [[orbital resonance#Coincidental 'near' ratios of mean motion|near resonances]].<ref name="Matson" />
