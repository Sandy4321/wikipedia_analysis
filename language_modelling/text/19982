The '''Chevrolet Lumina''' [[sedan (car)|sedan]] , coupe and [[minivan]] were first introduced in 1989 for the 1990 [[model year]] as a new range of vehicles from the [[Chevrolet]] brand of [[General Motors]] to replace both the [[Chevrolet Celebrity]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]], and the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] coupe. The Lumina was an answer from [[General Motors]] to the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]. All Luminas were built at the [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] plant, in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  The Chevrolet Lumina had the longest length from any other [[GM W platform|W-body]] car at the time.

Consumers were ultimately confused by having two different vehicles (the Lumina sedan and the [[Chevrolet Lumina APV|Lumina APV]] minivan) share the same name, and the concept was eventually dropped when the Lumina APV was replaced by the [[Chevrolet Venture]] in 1997.

The North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size [[GM W platform]], which was shared with the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]], [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]], [[Buick Regal]] and [[Buick Century]] (after 1996). Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the [[Ford Taurus]].  The Chevrolet Lumina's first generation ended production in 1994, making this the shortest-lived generation of the first-generation GM W-body cars.

In 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in [[NASCAR]], more than a year before the model was available to the public.

In 1987 however, GM was experimenting with a high end performance version above the Z34 to continue where the Z34 left off. The experimental "Z50" version as it was dubbed featured all-wheel-drive and an all aluminum 5.0&nbsp;L 305ci LT1-style V8 which had 285&nbsp;hp (213&nbsp;kW) and 280&nbsp;ft<U+00B7>lbf (380 N<U+00B7>m) of torque. It never made it to production. The whereabouts of these test-cars remains unknown.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

=== Lumina Z34 ===
{{Main|Lumina Z34}}

The high performance version of the Lumina was the Lumina ''Z34'' (coupe) and Euro ''3.4'' (sedan). Along with a performance suspension package, it was fitted with the 3.4 [[Liter|L]] [[DOHC]] ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LQ1|LQ1]]'' [[V6]], putting out 210 [[Horsepower|hp]] at 5200 rpm and 215 [[Foot-pound force|lb<U+00B7>ftf]] (292 N<U+00B7>m) of [[torque]] at 4400 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The LQ1 could be had with either a four speed automatic or a bespoke five speed manual, the Getrag 284. Unique cosmetic changes include a factory spoiler and [[body molding]]s, a louvered hood, and a unique steering wheel. The grille was also replaced with a body-colored panel with a small outlet, reminiscent of the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)#Ford Taurus SHO|Ford Taurus SHO]]. Performance figures are quite impressive for a front wheel drive V6 car, with a 0-60(mph) time of 7.5 seconds, 1/4 mile (~400&nbsp;m) time of 15.5 seconds and a (limited) top speed of 130&nbsp;mph (209.21&nbsp;km/h).

The Lumina received a major redesign for 1995, with the Monte Carlo name being resurrected for the 2-door version previously sold as the Lumina coupe, and slightly larger.  The Euro model was dropped, replaced by the ''LS'' trim.  The LHO V6 was dropped in favor of the L82 V6, also known as the 3100 SFI. This Lumina was also sold with police (code 9C3) and taxi packages after the [[Chevrolet Caprice]] was dropped after the 1996 model year.

Initial trim levels consisted of ''base'' and ''LS''. Options included an electric sunroof, leather bucket seats, power windows, power driver seat, and AM/FM stereo with CD player.

The '''LTZ''' trim was introduced in 1997 to soften the blow from the discontinued Impala SS and Caprice.  Its standard features included 16" brushed aluminum wheels, blackwall radial sport tires, sport tuned suspension, a 3.1 L V6 rated at {{convert|160|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|185|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} or an optional 3.4 L V6 rated at {{convert|215|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|220|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque, a rear spoiler, restyled front and rear body clips (resembling the Monte Carlo Z34), a tachometer, and a floor-mounted shifter.

In 1998 the 3.4 L V6 was replaced by the 3800 Series II which made {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} torque. Despite its increased torque, the 3.8 liter LTZ demonstrated slightly worse performance due to its lowered horsepower, with 0-60&nbsp;mph (0<U+2013>100&nbsp;km/h) times of 7.5 seconds (as opposed to 7.2 for the LQ1) and 1/4 mile (~400&nbsp;m) times of 15.7 seconds (as opposed to 15.5 for the LQ1). The car has a naturally-limited top speed of {{convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and the rev limiter kicks in at 5800 rpm.

Also in 1998, the Lumina received second generation airbags.  The front-wheel drive [[Chevrolet Impala]] was introduced as a replacement for the Lumina in 2000, although GM did produce 2001 model year Luminas to be exclusively sold for rental fleets.  Sales of the Lumina ended in Canada in 1999.  US production ended on April 26, 2001. In some Asian countries, the Lumina continued as a rebadged Buick Century/Regal.

=== Specification levels ===

[[File:Lumina.jpg|thumb|left|Chevrolet Lumina LTZ]]

Throughout its lifecycle, the second generation Lumina was available in three trim levels:

'''Base''' (1995<U+2013>2001): The most popular Lumina, the base model came well equipped for its price point. It had standard six-passenger seating, power locks, tilt steering wheel, dual airbags, and air conditioning. Base models were equipped with fifteen-inch steel wheels with wheel covers.

'''LS''' (1995<U+2013>1999): One step above the base, LS models offered aluminum wheels, optional dual zone temperature controls, power windows (optional on Base), tachometer, higher-end stereo with GM's Delcolock, anti-lock brakes, remote keyless entry system, upgraded seats, and an optional 3.4&nbsp;L DOHC engine.

'''LTZ''' (1997<U+2013>1999): The top of the line Lumina which included alloy wheels, a choice of the 3.1 L V6 engine, 3.4L DOHC engine or 3.8&nbsp;L V6 engine (1998-1999 only), power driver seat, dual zone climate control and leather with the option for deluxe cloth. A center console was standard on LTZ (optional on LS). To differentiate itself aesthetically from the lesser models, it received the front end and trunk lid from the Fifth Generation [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].

Since 1998, the [[Holden Commodore]] has been sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Africa]], and previously  in [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]]. A coupe version based on the [[Holden Monaro]] was also sold in the Middle East as the '''Chevrolet Lumina Coupe'''.

[[Holden]] released the all new VE [[Holden Commodore]] in Australia in 2006. In 2007 it was rebadged and exported from [[Australia]] as the newest generation of the Chevrolet Lumina. It is currently being sold in the [[Middle East]] and [[South Africa]]. The Holden Ute is in South Africa available as the '''Lumina Ute'''
