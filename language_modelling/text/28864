Sonic's menu consists of some classic fast food items, such as hamburgers, and french fries as well as other "carnival-like" fare such as onion rings, corndogs, and hotdogs. Other items that are special to Sonic's menu include Breakfast Toaster sandwiches (made with [[Texas toast]] instead of the typical [[bun]]) and Cheddar Peppers. Drink options include [[soft drink]]s, slushes and [[milkshake]].

[[File:Sonic Drive in.jpg|thumb|right|A Sonic Drive-in at night in 2007.]]
At a standard Sonic Drive-In, a customer drives into a covered drive-in stall, orders through an [[intercom]] speaker system, and has the food delivered by a [[carhop]]. Most drive-ins also have patio seating, and many have drive-thru lanes.

==History==

===1950s===
Following [[World War II]], Sonic founder [[Troy Smith (businessman)|Troy N. Smith Sr.]] returned to his hometown of [[Seminole, Oklahoma]], where he became employed as a [[milkman]]. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long he sold it and opened a [[fast food restaurant]], Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, on the edge of town. In 1953, Smith went in with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up [[root beer]] stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging [[United States dollar|$]]700 a week in the sale of root beer, [[hamburger]]s and [[hot dog]]s, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.<ref name="Sonic, The History of America's Drive-In">{{cite book|last=Blackburn|first=Bob L.|title=Sonic: The History of America's Drive-in|year=2009|publisher=Cottonwood Publications|location=Oklahoma City, Okla|isbn=978-9720244024}}</ref>

Originally, Top Hat customers would park their [[automobile]]s anywhere on the [[gravel]] [[parking lot]] and walk up to place their orders. However, on a trip to [[Louisiana]], Smith saw a drive-in that used speakers for ordering. He suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from [[Loudspeaker|speakers]] at their cars, with carhops delivering the food to the cars. Smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a [[used car|used-car]] lot to establish a layout for controlled parking. He also had some so-called "[[jukebox]] boys" come in and wire an [[intercom|intercom system]] in the parking lot. Sales immediately tripled. Charles Woodrow Pappe, an [[entrepreneur]], chanced upon the Shawnee drive-in and was impressed. He and Smith negotiated the first [[Franchising|franchise]] location in [[Woodward, Oklahoma|Woodward]], Oklahoma, in 1956, based on nothing more than a handshake. By 1958, two more drive-ins were built, in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]] and [[Stillwater, Oklahoma|Stillwater]].<ref name="Sonic, The History of America's Drive-In" />
[[File:Sonic Neon Sign, OK History Center.jpg|thumb|right|Sonic Drive-In [[neon sign]] at the Oklahoma History Center.]]

Upon learning that the Top Hat name was already [[trademark]]ed, Smith and Pappe changed the name to '''Sonic''' in 1959. The new name worked with their existing slogan, "Service with the Speed of Sound". After the name change, the first Sonic sign was installed at the Stillwater Top-Hat Drive-In; the original sign still can be seen there. Although Smith and Pappe were being asked to help open new franchise locations, there was no real [[Royalties|royalty plan]] in place. The pair decided to have their paper company charge an extra [[penny]] for each Sonic-label hamburger bag it sold. The proceeds would then be split between Smith and Pappe. The first franchise contracts under this plan were drawn up, but there was still no joint [[marketing plan]], standardized [[menu]], or detailed operating requirements.<ref name="Sonic, The History of America's Drive-In" />

===1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Old Sonic Menu.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An old Sonic Drive-In menu at the [[Oklahoma History Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]].]]
Sonic's founders formed Sonic Supply as a supply and distribution division in the 1960s. Under Smith, longtime franchise holders Marvin Jirous and Matt Kinslow were hired to run the division. In 1973, Sonic Supply was restructured as a franchise company that was briefly named Sonic Systems of America, which provided franchisees with equipment, building plans, and basic operational instructions. As the company grew into a regionally known operation during the 1960s and 1970s, the drive-ins were located mainly in small towns in Oklahoma, [[Texas]], [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Missouri]] and [[Arkansas]]. In 1967, the year Pappe died, there were 41 drive-in locations. By 1972, this number had risen to 165, and by 1978, {{formatnum:1000}}.

In 1968, Sonic introduced the Pickle-O's, fried pickle slices.<ref name=csm>{{cite news|last=Velasco|first=Schuyler|title=10 fast foods that have disappeared: 8.

In 1977, the company established the Sonic School for manager training. Franchisees operated most of the drive-ins and often made the store manager a business partner, even to this day.<ref name="answers">{{cite web | title =Company History: Sonic Corp.| work =Hoover's Company Profiles| publisher =Answers.com| url= http://www.answers.com/topic/sonic-corporation| accessdate =22 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="referenceforbusiness.com">{{cite web| title = A Brand New Look in 1998| work = Sonic Corp. <U+2014> Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Sonic Corp.| publisher = NetIndustries, LLC| year = 2007| url = http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/39/Sonic-Corp.html| accessdate = 2008-07-21}}</ref>

===1980s and 1990s===

In 1983, the company's board of directors saw the need for change.{{clarify|date=July 2012|reason=why?}} C. Stephen Lynn was hired as president, and, in 1984, Lynn hired [[J. Clifford Hudson]], an attorney, to head the legal department. Under Lynn, Sonic and its major franchisees began to encourage the development of local-advertising cooperatives, and developed a field structure to work with the franchisees. New franchises began to expand the company into new areas and redevelop markets that had been unsuccessful in the past.  These developments, combined with a major advertising campaign featuring singer and actor [[Frankie Avalon]], led to significant growth and a new image that would make Sonic a nationally recognized name. In 1986, Lynn, with a group of investors, completed a $10-million [[leveraged buyout]] and took the company [[Privately held company|private]]. The next year, Sonic moved its offices to leased space at 120 Robert S. Kerr Avenue in downtown Oklahoma City and began to assume a higher profile in the community.<ref name=AAC>{{cite news |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Sonic-Corp-company-History.html |title=Sonic Corp. |publisher=Funding Universe |accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 1991, Sonic became a [[Public company|publicly traded]] company again.

During the mid-1990s, Sonic opened 100<U+2013>150 new restaurants a year. Beginning in 1998, Sonic began a [[retrofit]] program, called "Sonic 2000", to redesign and update all {{formatnum:1750}} stores in its chain to what was called a "retro-future" look.<ref name="referenceforbusiness.com"/>

In 2009, Sonic partnered with [[DonorsChoose.org]] on a collaborative effort, Limeades for Learning, the chain's first systemwide [[cause marketing]] initiative. Public school teachers request needed supplies and materials and Sonic customers vote on how to allocate more than half a million dollars each fall.

Despite growth into new markets outside the brand's traditional footprint, the company was hit hard by the recession of 2008<U+2013>2009. In 2009, the brand saw multiple quarters of declines in same-store sales for the first time in recent memory.{{clarify|date=July 2012|reason=please replace poetic "recent memory" with a more specific time frame}} Alaska has yet to have a Sonic location, but attempts to acquire one have been made in the past.<ref>[[Staff writer]] (2009-09-18).
