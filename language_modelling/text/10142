'''''Azotobacter''''' is a [[genus]] of usually [[Motility|motile]], oval or spherical [[bacteria]] that form thick-walled [[cyst]]s and may produce large quantities of capsular [[Slime mold|slime]]. They are aerobic, free-living soil [[Microorganism|microbes]] which play an important role in the [[nitrogen cycle]] in nature, binding atmospheric [[nitrogen]], that is inaccessible to plants  and releasing it in the form of [[ammonium]] ions in to the soil. Apart from being a [[model organism]], it is used by humans for the production of [[biofertilizer]]s, [[food additive]]s and some [[biopolymer]]s. The first representative of the genus, ''Azotobacter chroococcum'', was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch [[microbiologist]] and botanist [[Martinus Beijerinck]]. ''Azotobacter'' are [[Gram-negative bacteria]]. They are found in neutral and alkaline soils,<ref>{{cite journal|author = Gandora V., Gupta R. D., Bhardwaj K. K.

==Biological characteristics==
===Morphology===
[[Cell (biology)|Cell]]s of the genus ''Azotobacter'' are relatively large for bacteria (1<U+2013>2 micrometres in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from [[Bacillus (shape)|rods]] to [[Coccus|spheres]]. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In [[Microbiological culture|fresh cultures]], cells are mobile due to the numerous [[flagellum|flagella]].<ref>{{cite journal

|volume = 25|issue = 1|pages = 116<U+2013>119}}</ref> Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical and produce a thick layer of [[mucus]], forming the cell [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. The shape of the [[cell]] is affected by the [[amino acid]] [[glycine]] which is present in the nutrient medium [[peptone]].<ref>{{cite journal

Under microscope, the cells show inclusions, some of which are colored. In the early 1900s, the colored inclusions were regarded as "reproductive grains", or [[Gonidium|gonidia]] <U+2013> a kind of [[embryo]] cells.<ref>{{cite journal

====Cysts====
Cysts of the genus ''Azotobacter'' are more resistant to adverse environmental factors than the [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetative cells]], in particular, they are twice more resistant to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light. They are also resistant to drying, [[ultrasound]] and [[Gamma ray|gamma]] and solar irradiation, but not to heating.<ref>{{cite journal

|pmid = 13914732|journal = Journal of Bacteriology|year = 1962|volume = 84|pages = 119<U+2013>124}}</ref>

The formation of cysts is induced by changes in the concentration of nutrients in the medium and addition of some organic substances such as [[ethanol]], n-[[butanol]] or [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|<U+03B2>-hydroxybutyrate]]. Cysts are rarely formed in liquid media.<ref>{{cite journal

====Germination of cysts====
A cyst of the genus ''Azotobacter'' is the resting form of a [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of ''Azotobacter'' does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of [[pH]], temperature and source of [[carbon]], the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply via a [[Asexual reproduction|simple division]]. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light [[refraction|refractive]] by cysts, which is detected with [[phase contrast microscopy]]. Germination of cysts is a slow process that takes about 4<U+2013>6 hours. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of [[volutin]], which were located in the [[Tunica intima|intima]] (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape.<ref>{{cite journal
|author = Wyss O., Neumann M. G., Socolofsky M. D.|title= Development and germination of the Azotobacter cyst|doi=10.1083/jcb.10.4.555|journal = Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology|year = 1961|volume = 10|issue = 10|pages = 555<U+2013>565}}</ref> This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb [[oxygen]] and emit [[carbon dioxide]]; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after 4 hours. The synthesis of [[protein]]s and [[RNA]],  occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after 5 hours after the addition of the carbon source. The synthesis of [[DNA]] and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 hours after the addition of glucose to a nitrogen-free nutrient medium.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Loperfido B., Sadoff H. L.|title = Germination of Azotobacter vinelandii Cysts: Sequence of Macromolecular Synthesis and Nitrogen Fixation|pmc=285299
|journal = Journal of Bacteriology|year = 1973|volume = 112|issue = 2|pages = 841<U+2013>846}}</ref>

Germination of cysts is accompanied by changes in the intima, visible with an electron microscope. The intima consists of [[carbohydrates]], [[lipid]]s and proteins and has almost the same volume as the central body. During germination of cysts, the intima [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] and is used by the cell for the synthesis its components.<ref>{{cite journal

===Physiological properties===
''Azotobacter'' [[aerobic respiration|respire aerobically]], receiving energy from [[redox]] reactions, using organic compounds as [[electron donor]]s. ''Azotobacter'' can use a variety of carbohydrates, [[alcohol]]s and salts of [[organic acid]]s as sources of carbon and can fix at least 10 micrograms of nitrogen per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires [[molybdenum]] ions, but they can be partially replaced by [[vanadium]] ions. The source of nitrogen can be [[nitrate]]s, [[Ammonia|ammonium]] ions or [[amino acid]]s. The optimal [[pH]] for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0<U+2013>7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5.<ref>{{cite book|chapter= Part B: The Gammaproteobacteria|title= Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology|url= http://www.springer.com/life+sci/book/978-0-387-95040-2

While growing, ''Azotobacter'' produce flat, slimy, paste-like colonies with a diameter of 5<U+2013>10&nbsp;mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can have dark brown, green and other colors, or may be colorless, depending on the species. The growth is favored at a temperature of 20<U+2013>30 <U+00B0>C.<ref>{{cite book|author = Tepper EZ, Shilnikova VK, Pereverzev, GI|title= Workshop on Microbiology|place= M.|year = 1979|page = 216}}</ref>

===Pigments===
''Azotobacter'' produce [[pigment]]s. For example, ''[[Azotobacter chroococcum]]'' forms a dark-brown water-soluble pigment [[melanin]]. This process occurs at high levels of metabolism during the fixation of nitrogen and, is though to protect the [[nitrogenase]] system from oxygen.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Shivprasad S., Page W.

===Genome===
The [[nucleotide]] sequence of chromosomes of ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'', strain AvOP is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 [[nucleotide]] pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of [[guanine]] + [[cytosine]] pairs is 65 [[Mole (unit)|mole]] percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, and in the stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium.<ref>{{cite journal

''Azotobacter'' have a full range of enzymes needed to perform the nitrogen fixation: [[ferredoxin]], [[hydrogenase]] and an important enzyme [[nitrogenase]]. The process of nitrogen fixation requires an influx of energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Nitrogen fixation is highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, and therefore ''Azotobacter'' developed a special defensive mechanism against oxygen, namely a significant intensification of metabolism that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the cells.<ref>{{cite journal

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Martinus Willem Beijerinck.jpg|thumb|Martinus Beijerinck (1851<U+2013>1931), discoverer of the genus ''Azotobacter''.]]
The ''Azotobacter'' genus was discovered in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck, who was one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. He selected and described the species ''Azotobacter chroococcum'' <U+2013> the first [[aerobic]], free-living nitrogen fixer.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Beijerinck M. W.
|title= Ueber Oligonitrophile Mikroben|journal = Zentralblatt f<U+00FC>r Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde, Infektionskrankheiten und Hygiene. Abteilung II|language=German|year = 1901|issue = 7
|pages = 561<U+2013>582}}</ref>

In 1903, Lipman described ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'', and a year later {{btname|[[Azotobacter beijerinckii]]|Lipman, 1904}}, which he named in honor of Beijerinck. In 1949, Russian microbiologist [[Nikolai Krasilnikov]] identified the species of {{btname|[[Azotobacter nigricans]]|Krasil'nikov, 1949}} which was divided in 1981 by Thompson Skerman into two subspecies of ''Azotobacter nigricans'' subsp. ''nigricans'' and ''Azotobacter nigricans'' subsp. ''achromogenes''; in the same year, Thompson and Skerman described the {{btname|[[Azotobacter armeniacus]]|Thompson and Skerman, 1981}}. In 1991, Page and Shivprasad reported a [[microaerophilic]] and air-tolerant type {{btname|Azotobacter salinestris|Page and Shivprasad 1991}} which was dependent on [[sodium]] ions.<ref>{{cite journal

Earlier, representatives of the genus were assigned to the family Azotobacteraceae {{smallcaps|Pribram}}, 1933, but then were transferred to the family [[Pseudomonadaceae]] based on the studies of nucleotide sequences [[16S rRNA]]. In 2004, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] study revealed that ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'' belongs to the same [[clade]] as the bacterium ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'',<ref>{{cite journal
