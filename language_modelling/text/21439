The '''Byzantine Empire''' (native [[Greek language|Greek]] name: {{polytonic|<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03C4><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+1FEC><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>}} - ''Basileia t<U+014D>n R<U+014D>mai<U+014D>n'') is the term conventionally used since the 19th century to describe the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking [[Roman Empire]] of the [[Middle Ages]], centered around its capital of [[Constantinople]]. In certain specific contexts, usually referring to the time before the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it is also often referred to as the '''Eastern Roman Empire'''. During much of its history it was known to many of its Western contemporaries as the ''Empire of the Greeks'' because of the dominance of [[Greece|Greek]] language, culture and population.<ref>Byzantium and the Magyars, Gyula Moravcsik, Samuel R. Rosenbaum p. 11</ref> To its inhabitants, the Empire was simply the Roman Empire and its emperors continued the unbroken succession of Roman emperors. In the Islamic world it was known primarily as {{rtl-lang|ar|<U+0631><U+0648><U+0645>}} (''R<U+016B>m'').

There is no consensus on the exact moment when the Roman Empire became the Byzantine Empire. Many consider [[Constantine I]] (reigned 306-337), founder of [[Constantinople]], the first Byzantine Emperor.  Some historians place the point of transition earlier, during the reign of [[Diocletian]] (284-305), who reformed imperial administration by officially dividing the Empire into eastern and western halves.

Others make the change during the reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379<U+2013>395) and Christianity's official supplanting of the [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan Roman religion]], or, following his death in 395, when the political division between East and West became permanent. Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustus]], the last western Emperor, was forced to abdicate by his [[generalissimo]] [[Odoacer]], thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (ca. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions.<ref name="Europe"> ''Europe: A History''. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1996. ISBN 0-19-820171-0</ref>

In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of [[Hellenization]] and increasing [[Christianization]] was already under way.

The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, although Greek  rule continued over areas of the Empire's territory for several more years, until the fall of [[Despotate of Morea|Mystras]] in 1460 and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] in 1461.

==Name of the Byzantine Empire==
{{Byzantine Empire timeline infobox}}
{{details|Names of the Greeks}}
The term ''Byzantine Empire'' was never used during the Empire's existence. The Empire's native Greek name was '''<U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03AF><U+03B1>''', ''R<U+014D>mania'', or '''<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>''', ''Basileia R<U+014D>mai<U+014D>n'', a direct translation of the Latin name of the [[Roman Empire]], '''''Imperium Romanum'''''. The descriptor ''Byzantine'' was introduced in western Europe in 1557, derived from [[Byzantium]], the earlier name of Constantinople, by [[German people|German]] historian [[Hieronymus Wolf]] about a century after the [[fall of Constantinople]]. Hieronymus had taken it from the writing of 15th century Byzantine historian [[Laonicus Chalcocondyles]]. He presented a system of Byzantine historiography in his work ''Corpus Historiae Byzantinae'', in order to "distinguish [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] from [[medieval Greek]] history without drawing attention to their ancient predecessors".

The term 'Byzantine' was introduced in the English-speaking world by [[George Finlay|Sir George Finlay]] in 1851<!--first volume published in 1851 according to Harvard library catalogue-->, in his ''History of Greece, from its Conquest by the Crusaders to its Conquest by the Turks''.

Standardization of the term began gradually in the 18th century, when French authors such as [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] began to popularize it. Before this, the Empire was described in the West as the ''Empire of the Greeks'' (''Imperium Graecorum''), since Byzantine claims to Roman inheritance had been actively contested by Western Europeans at least since the time of the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|''Imperator Augustus'']] by [[Pope Leo III]] in 800.

==Origin==
===Partition of the Roman Empire===
During the [[second century|second]] and [[third century|third centuries]], the city of [[Rome]] became less important as an administrative centre for the Roman Empire. Simultaneously, provincial cities and regions became more important. [[Caracalla]]'s decree in 212, the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]'', extended [[citizenship]] outside Italy to all free adult males in the entire Roman Empire, effectively raising provincial populations to equal status with the city of [[Rome]] itself. After the mid [[3rd century]], Emperors spent little time in the capital, instead focusing on the contested northern frontiers or the rich cities in the [[Greek East]].

As administering the entire Empire from Rome became increasingly difficult, it was divided in the late 3rd century. The [[Tetrarchy]], established by [[Diocletian]] in 286, split the Empire in half, with two emperors (''Augusti'') ruling from Italy and Greece, each having as co-emperor a younger colleague of their own (''Caesares''). After Diocletian's voluntary abdication, the Tetrarchic system soon began to crumble: the division continued in some form into the [[4th century]] until 324 when [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] defeated his last rival and became the sole emperor.

===Constantine the Great=== 
Constantine made two momentous and far-reaching decisions; one being his decision to found a new capital city on the site of [[Byzantium]] and the other being his [[Constantine I and Christianity|sponsorship of Christianity]]. [[Byzantium]] was well-positioned astride the trade routes between East and West; it was a superb base from which to guard the crucial Danubian provinces and was reasonably close to the Eastern frontiers. Constantine had experienced its potential as a fortress firsthand when it held out as the last pocket of resistance during his successful war against his Eastern rival [[Licinius]] (324). Constantine also recognized that the Eastern Empire, especially Asia Minor, was wealthier and more culturally homogenous than the West.

In 330, [[New Rome|Nova Roma]] was officially founded very near the location of Byzantium (which subsequently disappeared). However the populace commonly called it [[Constantinople]] (in Greek, <U+039A><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03CD><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C2>, ''K<U+014D>nstantinoupolis'', meaning Constantine's City). Constantine began the building of the [[Walls of Constantinople|great fortified walls]] that were perhaps the most striking feature of the city. These walls, expanded and rebuilt in subsequent ages, combined with the fortified harbor and fleet, made Constantinople a virtually impregnable fortress, and certainly the most important fortified city in the early Middle Ages. On several occasions in the centuries to come, the impregnability of Constantinople arguably was decisive in ensuring not only the continued existence of Roman/Byzantine power, but also that of [[Christendom]] as a whole.
[[Image:Constantine Musei Capitolini.jpg|left|thumb|Constantine I.]]

The new capital became the center of Constantine's administration. He deprived the single [[praetorian prefect]] of his civil functions, introducing regional prefects with civil authority. During the 4th century, four great "regional prefectures" were also created.

Constantine is generally considered to be the first Christian emperor, although the precise nature of his religious beliefs is not an easy matter to discern. Tradition holds that he received a vision from the Christian God at the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]] in 312 promising him victory with the adaptation of the [[labarum]] as his insignia. For some time after the battle, imperial proclamations did not make explicit reference to Christianity, and public works such as the [[Arch of Constantine]] display no trace of Christian imagery. [[Saint Eusebius|Eusebius]] records that, as was customary among Christian converts at the time, Constantine delayed receiving [[baptism]] until shortly before his death. Whatever the actual case may be, there is no question that after 312 Constantine began to shower favors on Christianity; the religion, which had been persecuted under Diocletian, became legally permitted and steadily increased in public influence as years passed, apart from a short-lived return to pagan predominance under [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]. Christianity would become one of the defining characteristics of the Byzantine Empire, as opposed to the pagan Roman Empire. Constantine also introduced a new stable gold coin, the ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', which was to become the standard coin for centuries, and not only in the Byzantine Empire.

After Emperor [[Jovian]] was asphyxiated while hurrying to Constantinople in 364, [[Valentinian]] was crowned emperor. He felt that he needed help to govern the large and troublesome empire, and, on [[March 28]] of that year appointed his brother [[Valens]] as co-emperor in the palace of Hebdomon. Valens took the eastern half of the Balkan peninsula, Greece, Egypt, Syria and Asia Minor as far east as Persia. 
[[Image:Byzantium395AD2lightpurple.PNG|thumb|310px|The Roman Empire, c.395 AD.|left]]

Valens' reign ended in 378 with one of the defining moments in the history of the Empire, when he and the best of the remaining [[Roman legion]]s were slaughtered by the [[Visigoths]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (378)|Battle of Adrianople]]. This defeat has been proposed by some authorities as one possible date for dividing the ancient and medieval worlds, as it demonstrated the obsolescence of the [[infantry]]-dominated Roman military machine and the rise of [[cavalry]], which was to dominate the Middle Ages. 

The Empire was divided further by Valens' successor [[Theodosius I]] (also called "the Great"), who had ruled both parts since 392. Following the dynastic principle well established by Constantine, in 395 Theodosius gave the two halves to his two sons [[Arcadius]] and [[Flavius Augustus Honorius|Honorius]]. Arcadius became ruler of the eastern half, with his capital in Constantinople, and Honorius took the west, with his capital in [[Milan]]. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule both the eastern and western parts of the empire.

==Early history==
[[Image:Leo I Louvre Ma1012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] of the Byzantine Empire (401 - 474, reigned 457 - 474).]] The Eastern Empire was largely spared the difficulties of the west in the 3rd and 4th centuries (see [[Crisis of the Third Century]]), in part because urban culture was better established there and the richer east could more easily afford both to placate invaders with [[tribute]] and pay barbarian [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to serve in its armies. Throughout the 5th century, various invading armies overran the western half of the Roman Empire but refrained from ravaging the east. [[Theodosius II]] further fortified [[Walls of Constantinople|the walls of Constantinople]], leaving the city impenetrable to attacks; it was to be preserved from foreign conquest until 1204. To spare the Eastern Roman Empire from the invasion of the [[Huns]] of [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], Theodosius gave them subsidies, said to be 300kg (700lbs) of gold.<ref name=Nathan>Nathan, Geoffrey, ''The Roman Emperors: Theodosius II''</ref> Moreover, he favored merchants living in Constantinople who traded with the barbarians. 

His successor, [[Marcian]], refused to continue to pay this exorbitant sum. However, [[Attila]] had already diverted his attention to the Western Roman Empire. After he died in 453, the Hunnic Empire collapsed and Constantinople breathed again, even starting a profitable relationship with the remaining Huns, who would eventually fight as mercenaries in Byzantine armies.

After the fall of Attila, the true chief in Constantinople was the [[Alans|Alan]] general [[Aspar]]. [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo I]] managed to free himself from the influence of the barbarian chief favouring the rise of the [[Isauri]]ans, a semi-[[barbarian]] tribe living in Roman territory, in southern [[Anatolia]]. Aspar and his son Ardabur were murdered in a riot in 471, and henceforth, Constantinople was freed from the influence of barbarian leaders for centuries. 

Leo was also the first emperor to receive the crown not from a general or an officer, as evident in the Roman tradition, but from the hands of the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]]. This habit became mandatory as time passed, and in the Middle Ages, the religious characteristic of the coronation totally substituted the old military form. In 468, Leo unsuccessfully attempted to reconquer North Africa from the Vandals. By that time, the Western Roman Empire was restricted to Italy and the lands south of the Danube as far as the Balkans (Britain had been abandoned and was slowly being conquered by the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], Spain had been overrun by the [[Visigoths]] and Suevi, the [[Vandals]] had taken Africa while [[Gaul]] was being contested by the [[Franks]], Burgundians, Bretons, Visigoths and some Roman remnants). 
[[Image:3Byzantium476lightblue.PNG|thumb|left|310px|Eastern Roman Empire, c. [[480]] [[Anno Domini|AD]].]]
In 466, as a condition of his Isaurian alliance, Leo married his daughter Ariadne to the Isaurian Tarasicodissa, who took the name [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]].  When Leo died in 474, Zeno and Ariadne's younger son (Leo I's grandson) succeeded to the throne as [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo II]], with Zeno acting as regent.  When Leo II died later that year, Zeno became emperor.  The end of the Western Empire is sometimes dated to 476, early in Zeno's reign, when the barbarian general [[Odoacer]] deposed the titular Western Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]], but declined to replace him with another puppet. 

To recover Italy, Zeno could only negotiate with the [[Ostrogoths]] of [[Theodoric]], who had been settled in [[Moesia]]. He sent the barbarian king to Italy as ''magister militum per Italiam'' ("commander in chief for Italy"). After the fall of Odoacer in 493, Theodoric, who had lived in Constantinople during his youth, ruled Italy on his own, maintaining a merely formal obedience to Zeno. He was the most powerful Germanic king of that age, but his successors were greatly inferior and their kingdom of Italy started to decline in the 530s. 

In 475, Zeno was deposed by a plot to elevate [[Basiliscus]] (the general who led Leo I's 468 invasion of North Africa) to the throne. Zeno recovered the throne twenty months later. However, he had to face the threat from his Isaurian former official Illo and the other Isaurian, [[Leontius]], who was also elected rival emperor. Isaurian prominence ended when an aged civil officer of Roman origin, [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]], became emperor in 491 and after a long war defeated them in 498. Anastasius revealed himself to be an energetic reformer and an able administrator. He perfected Constantine I's coinage system by definitively setting the weight of the copper ''follis'', the coin used in most everyday transactions. He also reformed the tax system, and abolished the hated [[chrysargyron]] tax in a manner that ensured that it could never be revived. The State Treasury contained the enormous sum of 320,000 pounds of gold when he died.

==Age of Justinian I==
[[Image:Meister von San Vitale in Ravenna 003.jpg|right|thumb|310px|[[Justinian I]] depicted on one of the famous mosaics of the St. Vitale church in [[Ravenna]].]]

The reign of [[Justinian I]], which began in 527, saw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories. The 6th century also saw the beginning of a long series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire's traditional early enemies, such as the [[Sassanid empire|Sassanid Persians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgars]]. Theological debates, such as over the question of [[Monophysitism]], also caused civil unrest.

Justinian, the son of an [[Illyricum|Illyrian]] peasant, had perhaps already exerted effective control during the reign of his predecessor and uncle, [[Justin I]] (518<U+2013>527). Justin I was a former officer in the imperial army who had been chief of the guards to Anastasius I, and had been proclaimed emperor (almost at the age of 70) after Anastasius' death. Justinian was later adopted as Justin's son. Justinian was determined to re-establish Roman rule over all of the Mediterranean world. Ruling with his influential wife, [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], a former [[courtesan]], Justinian reformed the administration and the law, and with the help of brilliant generals such as [[Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], he regained much of the lost Roman territories in the west, conquering much of [[Italy]], [[North Africa]], and a small area in southern [[Spain]].

In 532, attempting to secure his eastern frontier, Justinian signed a peace treaty with the Sassanid Shah [[Khosrau I of Persia|Khosrau I]] agreeing to pay a large annual tribute to the Sassinids. The same year, the [[Nika riots]] erupted and lasted for one week in the capital. This was a most violent revolt, and nearly half of Constantinople was destroyed.

The western conquests began in 533, as Justinian sent Belisarius to reclaim the former province of North Africa with a small army of 15,000 men, mainly mercenaries. An earlier expedition in 468 had been a failure, but this new venture was successful. The kingdom of the [[Vandals]] at [[Carthage]] lacked the strength of former times under King [[Gaiseric]] and the Vandals surrendered after few battles against Belisarius' forces. General Belisarius received a [[Roman triumph]] in [[Constantinople]] with the last Vandal king, [[Gelimer]], as his prisoner. However, the reconquest of [[North Africa]] would take a few more years to stabilize. It was not until 548 that the major local independent tribes were subdued.

In 535, Justinian I launched his most ambitious campaign, the reconquest of Italy. Italy was under the rule of the [[Ostrogoth]]s. He dispatched an army to march overland from [[Dalmatia]] while the main contingent, again under the command of General Belisarius, went by sea to [[Sicily]] and easily conquered the island. The marches on the Italian mainland were initially victorious and the major cities, including [[Naples]], [[Rome]] and the capital [[Ravenna]], fell one after the other. The Goths were seemingly defeated and Belisarius returned to Constantinople in 541 with the Ostrogoth king [[Witiges]] as a prisoner in chains. 
[[Image:Byzantium5503lightblue.PNG|thumb|310px|right|Map of the Byzantine Empire around 550]]

However, the Ostrogoths and their supporters were soon reunited under the energetic command of [[Totila]]. The ensuing [[Gothic War (535<U+2013>552)|Gothic Wars]] were an exhausting series of sieges, battles and retreats that consumed almost all the Byzantine and Italian fiscal resources, impoverishing much of the peninsula. Belisarius was eventually recalled by Justinian, who had lost trust in his commander. At a certain point, the Byzantines seemed to be on the verge of losing all their reconquests. Having neglected to provide sufficient financial and logistical support to the desperate troops under Belisarius' former command, in the summer of 552 Justinian gathered a massive army of 35,000 men (mostly Asian and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] mercenaries) to contribute to the war effort. The astute and diplomatic [[eunuch]] [[Narses]] was chosen for the command. Totila was defeated and died at the [[Battle of Busta Gallorum]]. His  successor, [[Teias]], was likewise defeated at the [[Battle of Mons Lactarius]] (central Italy, October 552). Despite continuing resistance from a few Goth garrisons and two subsequent invasions by the [[Franks]] and [[Alamanni]], the war for the Italian peninsula was at an end.

Justinian's program of reconquest was further extended in 554 when a Byzantine army took advantage of a civil war to seize a small part of [[Spain]] from the [[Visigoths]]. All the main [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] islands were also now under Byzantine control. 

Aside from these conquests, Justinian revised the ancient [[Roman law|Roman legal code]] in the new [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Even though the laws were still written in [[Latin]], the language itself was becoming archaic and poorly understood even by those who wrote the new code. Under Justinian's reign, the Church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople (''"Holy Wisdom"''), the most famous and important of the Empire, was rebuilt in the 530s, having been destroyed during the Nika riots. The 6th century was also a time of flourishing culture and even though Justinian closed the university at [[Athens]], the Empire produced notable people such as the epic poet [[Nonnus]], the lyric poet [[Paul the Silentiary]], the historian [[Procopius]] and the natural philosopher [[John Philoponus]], among others.
[[Image:theodora ravenna.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora]] and her retinue (mosaic from [[Basilica of San Vitale]], 6th century).]]

The conquests in the west meant that other parts of the Empire were left almost unguarded even though Justinian was a great builder of fortifications in Byzantine territories throughout his reign. Khosrau I had, as early as 540, broken his pact with Justinian and plundered [[Antioch]]ia. The only way Justinian could forestall him was to increase the sum he paid to the Persians every year. The [[Balkans]] were subjected to repeated incursions from the [[Slavs]], who had first crossed the imperial frontiers during the reign of [[Justin I]]. They took advantage of the sparsely deployed Byzantine troops and pressed on as far as the [[Gulf of Corinth]]. The [[Kutrigur]] [[Bulgars]] also attacked in 540. The Slavs invaded [[Thrace]] in 545 and in 548 assaulted [[Dyrrachium]], an important port on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 550, the [[Sclaveni]] came within 65 kilometers of [[Constantinople]] itself. 

In 559, the Empire found itself unable to repel a great invasion of [[Kutrigurs]] and [[Sclaveni]]. Divided in three columns, the invaders reached [[Thermopylae]], the [[Gallipoli]] peninsula and the suburbs of [[Constantinople]]. The [[Slavs]] feared the intact power of the [[Danube]] Byzantine fleet and of the Utigurs (paid by the Byzantines themselves) more than the ill-prepared Byzantine imperial army. The Empire was safe, but in the following years Byzantine control in the Balkans was severely weakened. 

Soon after the death of Justinian in 565, the Germanic [[Lombards]], a former imperial ''foederati'' tribe, invaded and conquered much of Italy. The Visigoths reconquered [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], the main Byzantine city in Spain, first in 572 and then definitively in 584. The last Byzantine strongholds in Spain were swept away twenty years later. The [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] emerged in [[Crimea]], and, in 577, a horde of some 100,000 Slavs invaded [[Thrace]] and [[Illyricum]]. [[Sirmium]], the most important Roman city on the [[Danube]], was lost in 582, but the Byzantines managed to maintain control of the river for several more decades, even though they increasingly lost control of the inner provinces. 
{{History of Greece}}
Justinian's successor, [[Justin II]], refused to pay Justinian's tribute to the [[Sassanid Empire]]. This resulted in a long and costly war, which lasted until the reign of his successors [[Tiberius II Constantine|Tiberius II]] and [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], focused over the control over the disputed territory of [[Armenia]]. Fortunately for the Byzantines, the Persian Empire was weakened by a civil war. Maurice was able to take advantage of his friendship with the new king [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrau II]] (whose disputed accession to the Persian throne had been assisted by Maurice) in order to sign a favorable peace treaty in 591. This treaty gave the Byzantine Empire control over much of western Armenia. Maurice reorganized the remaining Byzantine possessions in the west into two [[Exarch]]ates: [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Ravenna]] and [[Exarchate of Carthage|Carthage]]. Maurice increased the Exarchates' self-defense capabilities and delegated them to civil authorities.

The [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] and later the [[Bulgars]] overwhelmed much of the [[Balkans]], and in the early 7th century the Sassanids invaded and conquered Egypt, Palestine, [[Syria]] and Armenia. The Persians were eventually defeated and the territories recovered by Emperor [[Heraclius]] in 627. However, the unexpected appearance of the [[Arab]]s, newly united and converted to [[Islam]], overwhelmed an Empire exhausted from the Persian wars, and the southern provinces were overrun.

The Byzantine Empire's most catastrophic defeat of this period was the [[Battle of Yarmuk]], fought in Syria. Heraclius and the military governors of Syria were slow to respond to the new threat, and Byzantine [[Mesopotamia]], Syria, Egypt, and the [[Exarchate of Africa]] were incorporated into the Muslim [[Caliphate]] in the 7th century, a process that was completed with the fall of [[Carthage]] in 698. The Byzantines made little attempt to regain the lost provinces, dominated as they were by [[Monophysitism]].

The [[Lombards]] continued to expand in northern Italy, taking [[Liguria]] in 640 and conquering most of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] in 751, leaving the Byzantines with control of only small areas around the toe and heel of Italy, plus some semi-independent coastal cities like [[Venice]], [[Naples]], [[Amalfi]] and [[Gaeta]].

==Fight for survival==
[[Image:ByzantineEmpire717AD2lightpurple.PNG|thumb|right|310px|The Byzantine Empire at the accession of Leo III, ''c.'' 717]]

The Empire's loss of territory was offset to a degree by consolidation and an increased uniformity of rule. Emperor [[Heraclius]] made [[Greek language|Greek]] the official language, and the Emperor's Latin title, ''Augustus'', was replaced with the Greek {{polytonic|<U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03CD><U+03C2>}} ''[[Basileus]]''.  Heraclius' reforms widened the cultural gap between the Eastern Roman Empire and its earlier predecessor, as well as the former imperial lands of western Europe.

Within the empire, the southern provinces differed significantly in culture and practice from those in the north, observing [[Monophysite]] [[Christianity]] rather than [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Chalcedonian Orthodox]]. The loss of the southern territories to the Arabs further strengthened Orthodox practice in the remaining provinces.

[[Constans II]] (reigned 641<U+2013>668) subdivided the empire into a system of military provinces called ''[[theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|themes]]'' in an attempt to improve local responses to the threat of constant assaults. Outside the capital urban life declined, but Constantinople grew to become what was likely the largest city in the world.

During Constans' reign the Byzantines completely withdrew from [[Egypt]], and the [[Arab]]s launched numerous attacks on the islands of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Aegean Sea]]. Constans sent a fleet to attack the Arabs at Finike in 655, but was defeated: 500 Byzantine ships were destroyed in the battle, and the emperor himself came close to being killed. Only an [[First Fitna|Arab civil war]] forestalled the planned Muslim assault on [[Constantinople]]. 
[[Image:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|thumb|300px|left|Restored section of the fortifications that protected Constantinople during the medieval period.]] 

In 658, the imperial army defeated the [[Slavs]] on the [[Danube River]], temporarily slowing their advance into the [[Balkans]]. However, the arrival of the [[Bulgars]] in the 670s forced the Byzantines to abandon the Danube frontier, and soon nearly the entire Balkan peninsula was lost to the empire for the next three centuries.

Constans, having attracted the hatred of the people of Constantinople, temporarily moved the capital to [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. In 661, he launched an attack on the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Duchy of Benevento]] in southern Italy. After a series of victories and defeats, he retreated to [[Naples]]. He was the last Eastern emperor to visit [[Rome]] as a Byzantine possession, though [[Palaeologi|later emperors]] would return in the 15th century to beg for help against the Ottomans. Constans was assassinated in [[Sicily]] shortly after this campaign, and no serious attempt was made to reconquer southern Italy until the 9th century.

Arab attempts to conquer Constantinople were frustrated by the secret Byzantine weapon [[Greek fire]] (the exact composition of which remains a mystery to this day), the extensive city fortifications and the skill of both generals and warrior-emperors such as [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo the Isaurian]] (r. 717<U+2013>741). 

In his landmark work, ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', the 18th century historian [[Edward Gibbon]] depicted the Byzantine Empire of this time as effete and decadent.<ref>Edward Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', chapter 53.</ref> However, an alternative examination reveals an early medieval military [[superpower]]. Scholars point to the empire's [[heavy cavalry]] (the ''[[cataphract]]s''), its subsidy (albeit inconsistently) of a free and well-to-do peasant class forming the basis for cavalry recruitment, its extraordinarily in-depth defense systems (the themes) and its use of subsidies to make its enemies fight each other. Other factors include the empire's prowess at intelligence-gathering, a communications and logistics system based on [[mule]] trains, a superior (though often under-funded) navy and rational military strategies and doctrines (not dissimilar to those of [[Sun Tzu]]) that emphasized stealth, surprise, swift maneuvering and the marshaling of overwhelming force at the time and place of the commander's choosing.

The 8th century was dominated by controversy and religious division over [[iconoclasm]]. [[Icon]]s were banned by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], leading to revolts by iconodules (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of [[Byzantine Empress Irene|Empress Irene]], the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshipped. 

Irene also attempted a marriage alliance with [[Charlemagne]] the [[Franks|Frank]], recently crowned by the [[Pope]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the West]]. In theory, this alliance would have united the two 'Roman' empires and created a European superpower comparable in strength to ancient Rome. In practice, the two empires were so different that it is hard to see how such a union could have succeeded. Regardless, these plans were abandoned when Irene was deposed. 

The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]], who restored the icons. These controversies further contributed to the disintegrating relations with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Frankish/Germanic [[Holy Roman Empire]], both of which continued to increase their independence and power.

==Macedonian dynasty and resurgence==

The Early Byzantine Empire reached its height under the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] emperors of the late 9th, 10th, and early 11th centuries. During these years the Empire held out against pressure from the Roman church to remove Patriarch [[Photius I of Constantinople|Photios]]. The Empire gained control over the [[Adriatic Sea]], southern Italy, and all of [[Bulgaria]] as it was under the Bulgarian [[tsar]] [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuel]]. The cities of the empire expanded, and affluence was able to spread across the provinces because of the empire's new-found security. The population of the empire rose, and production increased, stimulating new demand while also helping to encourage [[trade]]. Culturally, this was a productive period of Byzantine history, as there was considerable growth in education and learning. Ancient texts were preserved and patiently re-copied. [[Byzantine art]] flourished, and brilliant [[mosaic]]s graced the interiors of new churches, which were being built across the empire in this period.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Though the empire was significantly smaller than it was during the reign of Justinian it emerged stronger during this period. This was largely due to the fact that its remaining territories were less geographically and more politically and culturally integrated. The lands it had lost were generally rebellious due to religious controversy or geographically discontinuous and difficult to defend. 

===Internal developments===
Although traditionally attributed to [[Basil I]] (867-886), initiator of the Macedonian dynasty, the "[[Byzantine renaissance]]" has been more recently ascribed largely to the reforms of his predecessor, [[Michael III]] (842-867) and his wife's counsellor, the erudite [[Theoktistos]]. The latter in particular favoured culture at the court, and, with a careful financial policy, increased steadily the gold reserves of the Empire. The rise of the Macedonian dynasty coincided with internal developments which strengthened the religious unity of the empire.<ref>Treadgold, Warren ''The Byzantine Revival'', September 1991</ref> The [[iconoclast]] movement was experiencing a steep decline: this favoured its soft suppression by the emperors and the reconciliation of the religious strife that had drained the imperial resources in the previous centuries. Despite occasional tactical defeats, the administrative, legislative, cultural and economic situation continued to improve under Basil's successors, especially with [[Romanos I|Romanos I Lekapenos]] (920-944). The [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme]] military subdivision reached its definitive form in this period, with new ones added in recognition of the new conquests. The church establishment began to support loyally the imperial cause, and the power of the landowning class was limited in favour of agricultural small holders, who made up an important part of the military force of the Empire. These favourable conditions contributed to the increasing ability of the emperors to wage war against the Arabs.

===Wars against the Muslims===
{{Byzantine culture}} 
By 867, the empire had stabilised its position in both the east and the west, while the success of its defensive military structure had enabled the emperors to begin planning wars of reconquest in the east. 

The Byzantine reconquest process began with variable fortunes. The temporary reconquest of [[Crete]] (843) was followed by a crushing Byzantine defeat on the Bosphorus, while the emperors were unable to prevent the ongoing gradual Muslim conquest of [[Sicily]] (827-902). Using present day [[Tunisia]] as their launching pad, the Muslims conquered [[Palermo]] in 831, [[Messina]] in 842, [[Enna]] in 859, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in 878, [[Catania]] in 900 and the final Greek stronghold, the fortress of [[Taormina]], in 902.

These drawbacks were later counterbalanced by a victorious expedition against [[Damietta]] in Egypt (856), the defeat of the Emir of [[Melitene]] (863), the confirmation of the imperial authority over [[Dalmatia]] (867) and Basil I's offensives towards the [[Euphrates]] (870s).

The threat from the Muslims was meanwhile reduced by inner struggles and by the rise of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] in the east. Muslims received assistance however from the [[Paulician]] sect, which had found a large following in the eastern provinces of the Empire and, facing persecution under the Byzantines, often fought under the Arab flag. It took several campaigns to subdue the Paulicians, who were eventually defeated by Basil I.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

In 904, disaster struck the empire when its second city, [[Thessalonica]], was sacked by an Arab fleet under a Byzantine renegade. The Byzantines responded by destroying an Arab fleet, in 908, and sacking the city of [[Laodicea]] in Syria two years later. Despite this revenge, the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces as they attempted to regain Crete in 911. 

The situation on the border with the Arab territories remained fluid, with the Byzantines alternatively on the offensive or defensive. [[The Rus]], who appeared near Constantinople [[Rus'-Byzantine War (860)|for the first time in 860]], were another new enemy to face. In 941 [[Rus'-Byzantine War (941)|they appeared on the Asian shore]] of the Bosphorus, but this time they were crushed, showing the improvements in the Byzantine military position after 907, when [[Rus'-Byzantine Treaty (907)|only diplomacy had been able to push back the invaders]]. The vanquisher of the Rus was the famous general [[John Kourkouas]], who continued the offensive with other noteworthy victories in Mesopotamia (943): these culminated in the reconquest of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] (944), which was especially celebrated for the return to Constantinople of the venerated ''[[Mandylion]]'' relic. 

The soldier emperors [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (reigned 963-969) and [[John I Tzimiskes]] (969-976) expanded the empire well into [[Syria]], defeating the emirs of north-west [[Iraq]] and reconquering [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. At one point under John, the empire's armies even threatened [[Jerusalem]], far to the south. The emirate of [[Aleppo]] and its neighbours became vassals of the empire in the east, where the greatest threat to the empire was the Egyptian [[Fatimid]] kingdom.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

===Wars against the Bulgars===
[[Image:Basilios_II.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Emperor Basil II the Bulgar Slayer (976-1025)]]

The traditional struggle with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]] continued, spurred by the question of religious supremacy over the newly Christianized Bulgaria. This prompted an invasion by the powerful tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] in 894, but this was pushed back by the Byzantine diplomacy, which called on the help of the Hungarians. The Byzantines were in turn defeated, however, at the [[Battle of Bulgarophygon]] (896), and obliged to pay annual subsides to the Bulgars. Later (912) Simeon even had the Byzantines grant him the crown of ''basileus'' of Bulgaria and had the young emperor [[Constantine VII]] marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered [[Edirne|Adrianople]].<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

A great imperial expedition under [[Leo Phokas]] and [[Romanos I|Romanos Lekapenos]] ended again with a crushing Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Anchialus]](917), and the following year the Bulgars were free to ravage northern Greece up to [[Corinth]]. Adrianople was captured again in 923 and in 924 a Bulgar army besieged Constantinople. The situation in the Balkans improved only after Simeon's death in 927.

Under the emperor [[Basil II]] (reigned 976-1025), the Bulgars, who had conquered much of the Balkans from the Byzantines since their arrival three hundred years previously, became the target of annual campaigns by the Byzantine army. The war was to drag on for nearly twenty years, but eventually at the [[Battle of Kleidon]] the Bulgars were completely defeated.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204''</ref> The Bulgarian army was captured, and it is said that 99 out of every 100 men were blinded, with the remaining hundredth man left with one eye so as to lead his compatriots home. When tsar [[Samuil of Bulgaria|Samuel]] saw the broken remains of his once gallant army, he died of shock. In 1014, Bulgaria surrendered, and became part of the empire. This stunning victory restored to the empire the [[Danube]] frontier, which had not been held since the days of the emperor Heraclius.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

The empire also gained a new ally at this time in the new [[Varangian]] state in [[Kiev]], from which the empire received an important mercenary force, the famous [[Varangian Guard]], in exchange for Basil's sister Anna as a wife for [[Vladimir I of Kiev]].<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Basil II also had relatives marry leaders of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

===Triumph===

[[Image:ByzantineEmpire1025AD2lightpurple.PNG|thumb|310px|The Byzantine Empire under [[Basil II]], ''c.'' 1025]]

The Byzantine Empire now stretched from [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] in the east, to [[Calabria]] in [[Southern Italy]] to the west.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Many successes had been achieved, ranging from the conquest of [[Bulgaria]], to the annexation of [[Georgia(country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]], to the total annihilation of an invading force of Egyptians outside [[Antioch]]. Yet even these victories were not enough; Basil considered the continued [[Arab]] occupation of [[Sicily]], to be an outrage. Accordingly, he planned to reconquer the island, which had belonged to the empire for over three hundred years (c.550-c.900). However, his death in 1025 put an end to the project.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

The 11th century was also momentous for its religious events. In 1054, relations between Greek-speaking Eastern and Latin-speaking Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on [[July 16]], when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during [[Divine Liturgy]] on a Saturday afternoon and placed a [[papal bull|bull]] of [[excommunication]] on the [[alta]]r, the so-called [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] actually was the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Although the schism was brought about by doctrinal disputes (in particular, Eastern refusal to accept the Western Church doctrine of the ''[[filioque]]'', or double procession of the [[Holy Spirit]]), disputes over administration and political issues had been a recurring feature in relations between the Eastern and Western churches for centuries.  The formal separation of the Byzantine [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and the Western [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] would have wide ranging consequences for the future of Byzantium.

==Crisis and fragmentation==
Byzantium soon fell into a period of difficulties, caused to a large extent by the growth of the aristocratic clique (known as the ''dynamoi''), which undermined the theme system. The succession of weak rulers who succeeded Basil II after 1025 disbanded the large armies which had been defending the eastern provinces from attack; instead gold was stockpiled in Constantinople, ostensibly in order to hire [[mercenary|mercenaries]] should troubles arise.<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''Byzantium at war AD600-1453''</ref>  In fact, most of the money was given away in the form of gifts to favourites of the emperor, extravagant court banquets, and expensive luxuries for the imperial family.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>  
[[Image:Meister der Predigtsammlung des Heiligen Johannes Chrysostomus 001.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Nikephoros III]] Botaniates, Byzantine emperor from 1078 to 1081]]
Meanwhile, the remnants of the once-formidable armed forces were allowed to decay, to the point where they were no longer capable of functioning as an army. At this point, the army consisted of elderly men with ill-maintained equipment mixed with untrained new recruits.<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''Byzantium at war AD600-1453''</ref> At the same time, the Empire was faced with new, ambitious enemies such as the [[Normans]] and the [[Turks]].

In 1040, the [[Normans]], originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of [[plunder]], began attacking the Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In order to deal with them, a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable [[George Maniakes]] was sent to Italy in 1042.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Maniakes and his army engulfed the land in a fury of destruction, leaving a trail of burning ruins and shattered fortresses behind them. However, before he could complete his campaign, the general was recalled to Constantinople. Gripped by murderous rage at a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With the opposition absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

It was in Asia Minor, however, that the greatest disaster would take place. The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]], who were mainly interested in defeating [[Egypt]] under the [[Fatimids]], nevertheless conducted a series of damaging raids into [[Armenia]] and eastern [[Anatolia]], which was the main recruiting ground for Byzantine armies. With the imperial armies weakened by years of insufficient funding and civil warfare, Emperor [[Romanos IV|Romanos Diogenes]] realised that a time of re-structuring and re-equipment was necessary. Consequently, he attempted to lead a defensive campaign in the east until his forces had recovered enough to defeat the Seljuks. However, he suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of [[Alp Arslan]] ([[Sultan]] of the Seljuk Turks) at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] in 1071. Romanos was captured, and, although the Sultan's peace terms were fairly lenient, the battle in the long term resulted in the total loss of Byzantine Anatolia.<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''Byzantium at war AD600-1453''</ref>

On his release, Romanos found that his enemies had conspired against him to place their own candidate on the throne in his absence. After two defeats in battle against the rebels, Romanos surrendered and suffered a horrific death by torture. The new ruler, [[Michael VII Doukas|Michael Doukas]], refused to honour the treaty that had been signed by Romanos. In response, the Turks began to move thousands of settlers into Anatolia in 1073, occupying nearly the whole peninsula unopposed. To make matters worse, chaos reigned as the empire's remaining resources were squandered in a series of disastrous civil wars. By 1080, an area of 30,000 square miles had been lost to the empire.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

==Komnenian dynasty and the crusaders==
===Alexios I Komnenos===
[[Image:Byzantium1081ADlightpurple-1-+Antioch.png|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine Empire at the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, c.1081AD]]
After Manzikert, a partial recovery was made possible due to the efforts of the [[Komnenos|Komnenian dynasty]]. This is sometimes referred to as the [[Komnenian restoration]].<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''The Byzantine Wars''</ref> The first emperor of this royal line was [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter [[Anna Komnene]] in the ''[[Alexiad]]''). Alexios' long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. 

At the very outset of his reign, Alexios had to meet the formidable attack of the Normans under [[Robert Guiscard]] and his son [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemund of Taranto]], who took [[Dyrrhachium]] and [[Corfu]], and laid siege to [[Larissa]] in [[Thessaly]] (see [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]]). Alexios led his forces in person against the Normans, yet despite his best efforts his army was destroyed in the field. Alexios himself was wounded in the battle, and for a time it looked as though the empire's final hour had come. Fortunately for Alexios, the Norman danger abated somewhat the time being after Robert Guiscard's death in 1085.<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''The Byzantine Wars''</ref>

Alexios's trials and tribulations were only just beginning. At the very moment when the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. [[Inflation]] was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different ''[[nomisma]]ta'' in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios had been forced to finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204''</ref>
  
[[Image:Histamenon nomisma-Alexius I-sb1776.jpg|thumb|right|250px|This coin was struck by Alexios during his war against [[Robert Guiscard]]]] 

In 1087, Alexios faced a new invasion. This time, the invaders consisted of a horde of 80,000 [[Pechenegs]] from north of the Danube, and they were heading for Constantinople. Without enough troops to repel this new threat, Alexios used  diplomacy to achieve a victory against the odds. Having bribed the [[Cumans]], another barbarian tribe, to come to his aid, he advanced against the Pechenegs, who were caught by surprise and annihilated at the [[Battle of Levounion]] on [[28 April]] [[1091]].<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''The Byzantine Wars''</ref>

With stability at last achieved in the west, Alexios now had a chance to begin solving his severe economic difficulties and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (''[[pronoia|pr<U+00F3>niai]]'') and prepared a to advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered [[Asia Minor]] and were now established at [[<U+0130>znik|Nicaea]].<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref>

However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in [[Asia Minor]]. Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent his ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. The ambassadors dispatched their mission with great success - at the [[Council of Piacenza]] in 1095, [[Pope Urban II]] was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east, and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a means not only to redirect the energy of the knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over [[Christendom]] and to gain the east for the See of Rome.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

===First Crusade===

[[Image:Jerusalem1099.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Medieval manuscript depicting the Capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade]]
{{details|First Crusade}}
On [[27 November]] 1095, Urban II called together the [[Council of Clermont]] in France. There, he urged all those present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch an armed [[pilgrimage]] to recover Jerusalem and the east from the [[Muslims]]. [[Indulgence|Papal indulgence]]s were to be granted to all those who took part in the great enterprise. With the feudal nobility of western Europe eager both for war and remission from sin, word of the [[First Crusade|Crusade]] spread quickly across western Europe.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref> 

Alexios had anticipated help in the form of mercenary forces from the West, and was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined hosts which soon arrived in Byzantine territory. The first group, under [[Peter the Hermit]], he sent to Asia Minor, ordering them to stay close to the coast and await reinforcements. However, the unruly crusaders refused to listen and began looting and pillaging the local inhabitants. As they marched on [[<U+0130>znik|Nicaea]], in 1096, they were caught by the Turks and massacred almost to the last man.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204''</ref>

The second, "official" arm of the Crusade, led by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], Alexios also sent into Asia, promising to supply them with provisions in return for an oath of loyalty. By their victories, Alexios was able to recover for the Byzantine Empire a number of important cities and islands <U+2014> [[<U+0130>znik|Nicaea]], [[Chios]], [[Rhodes]], [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Alasehir|Philadelphia]], [[Sardis]], and in fact much of western [[Asia Minor]] (1097<U+2013>1099). This is ascribed by his daughter Anna as a credit to his policy and diplomacy, but good relations were not to last. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to [[Antioch]], but had been persuaded to turn back by [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]], who assured him that all was lost and that the expedition had already failed); Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with Alexios, but agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

===Slow recovery===
Despite his many successes, during the last twenty years of his life, Alexios lost much of his popularity. This was largely due to the harsh measures he was forced to take in order to save the embattled empire. To restore the Empire's military position, Alexios introduced [[conscription]] and heavily taxed the nobility; these measures were resented by peasants and aristocrats respectively. In order to ensure that all taxes were paid in full, and to halt the cycle of debasement and inflation, he completely reformed the [[Byzantine coinage|coinage]], issuing a new gold ''[[hyperpyron]]'' (highly refined) coin for the purpose. By 1109, he had managed to restore order by working out a proper rate of exchange for the whole coinage. His new hyperpyron would be the standard Byzantine coin for the next two hundred years.<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref> 

The final years of Alexios's reign were marked by persecution of the followers of the [[Paulician]] and [[Bogomil]] heresies <U+2014> one of his last acts was to [[Execution by burning|burn at the stake]] the Bogomil leader, [[Basil the Physician]], with whom he had engaged in a theological controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110<U+2013>1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband, [[Nikephorus Bryennios]], for whose benefit the special title ''panhypersebastos'' ("honored above all") was created. This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours.<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref> 

===John's restoration of the empire===
[[Image:JohnIIcomnenus.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Emperor John II Komnenos. During his reign (1118-1143) he earned near universal respect, even from the Crusaders, for his courage, dedication and piety.]]

{{seealso|John II Komnenos|Battle of Beroia}}

Alexios' son [[John II Komnenos]] succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On account of his mild and just reign he has been called the Byzantine [[Marcus Aurelius]]. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty <U+2014> despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by his subjects, who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an energetic campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref>

During John's reign Byzantium faced many difficulties: enemies confronted the empire on all sides. An invasion of nomadic horsemen from the north threatened Byzantine control in the [[Balkans]]. The Turks were harassing Byzantine territory in [[Asia Minor]]. However, John soon proved himself just as determined and energetic as his predecessor Alexios. At the [[Battle of Beroia]], John personally led the imperial armies against the Pechenegs. With the aid of the emperor's [[Varangian Guard]], the horsemen were decisively crushed. The emperor's victory was so severe that the Pechenegs soon disappeared as an independent people. The [[Danube]] frontier had been secured.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref>

John was then able to concentrate on Asia Minor, which became the focus of his attention for most of his reign. The Turks were pressing forward against the Byzantine frontier, and John was determined to drive them back. Thanks to John's energetic campaigning, Turkish attempts at expansion in Asia Minor were halted, and John prepared to take the fight to the enemy. In order to restore the region to Byzantine control, John led a series of campaigns against the Turks. Regions which had been lost to the empire ever since Manzikert were recovered and garrisoned. Yet resistance, particularly from the [[Danishmends]] of the north-east, was strong, and John found it difficult to retain his many conquests in the face of Turkish counterattacks.

Towards the end of his reign, John made a concerted effort to secure [[Antioch]]. On the way, he captured the southern coast of Asia Minor and [[Cilicia]]. He advanced into Syria at the head of his veteran army, which had been seasoned by a lifetime of campaigning. Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, there was a famous incident where his allies, Prince [[Raymond of Antioch]] and Count [[Joscelin II of Edessa]], sat around playing [[dice]] while John pressed the siege of an enemy town. These Crusader Princes were suspicious of each other and of John, and neither wanted the other to gain from participating in the campaign, while Raymond also wanted to hold on to Antioch, which he had agreed to hand over to John if the campaign was successful.<ref name=Oldenbourg>Oldenbourg, Zoe, ''The Crusades''</ref> Ultimately, Joscelin and Raymond conspired to keep John out of Antioch, and while he was preparing to lead a [[pilgrimage]] to Jerusalem and a further campaign, he accidentally grazed his hand on a poison arrow while out hunting. The poison set in, and shortly afterwards he died. 
Overall, what is clear is that John II Komnenos left the empire a great deal better off than he had found it.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

===Manuel I Komnenos===
[[Image:Byzantium1170lightpurple.PNG|thumb|310px|right|Map of the Byzantine Empire under Manuel Komnenos, c.1170. By this time, the empire was once again the most powerful state in the Mediterranean, with client states stretching from Hungary to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and a network of allies and diplomatic contacts stretching from Aragon, France, Germany, Pisa, Genoa and Rome in the west, to Antioch, Jerusalem, Konya and Damascus in the east.]]
{{see|Manuel I Komnenos|Battle of Sirmium|Battle of Myriokephalon}}

John's chosen heir was his fourth son, [[Manuel I Komnenos]].  Manuel displayed an unusual enthusiasm for the West, to the extent that he organised and personally participated in [[tournament]]s, an act unheard of for a Byzantine Emperor.  His closeness to the Crusaders is also reflected in his positive portrayal in Latin histories.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

Manuel's foreign policy was both ambitious and expansive, reaching out to all corners of the Mediterranean world. He made several alliances, with the [[Pope]] and Western Christian kingdoms, and successfully handled the passage of the [[Second Crusade]] through his empire, establishing a Byzantine protectorate over the Crusader kingdoms of [[Outremer]].<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> 

Manuel campaigned aggressively against his neighbours both in the west and in the east; facing Muslims in Palestine, he allied himself with the Crusader [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and sent a large fleet to participate in a combined invasion of [[Fatimid Egypt]]. In an effort to restore Byzantine control over the ports of southern Italy, he sent an expedition to invade Italy in 1155. Operating as part of a coalition of Byzantine, rebel, and Papal forces, Manuel's armies achieved initial success. However, disputes within the coalition led to the eventual failure of the expedition. Despite this military setback, Manuel was undeterred, and his armies successfully invaded the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1167, defeating the Hungarians at the [[Battle of Sirmium]]. Manuel was highly successful in the Balkans and Hungary - historian Paul Magdalino argues that no emperor had dominated the region so effectively since [[Late Antiquity]].<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> 

In the east, however, Manuel's achievements are more ambiguous. Manuel suffered a major defeat at the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]], in 1176, against the Turks.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref> Despite this defeat, the imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory.<ref name=Haldon>Haldon, John, ''The Byzantine Wars''</ref> In the following year (1177) the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force in the Meander valley.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref>

Manuel's programme of fortification in Byzantine Asia, for which he was praised by Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates, is largely regarded as an important success. Manuel demanded tribute from the Turkmens of the Anatolian interior for the winter pasture in Imperial territory; he also improved the defenses of many cities and towns, and established new garrisons and fortresses across the region. As a result of the cumulative efforts of all three Komnenian emperors, Manuel's domination of Asia Minor was more effective than that of any emperor since before Manzikert.<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> 

In the religious sphere, disputes between the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] occasionally harmed efforts at cooperation with the Latins; however, Manuel was almost certainly the Byzantine emperor who came closest to healing the breach between the two churches. Pope [[Innocent III]] clearly had a positive view of Manuel when he told [[Alexios III]] that he should imitate "your outstanding predecessor of famous memory the emperor Manuel... in devotion to the Apostolic See, both in words and in works".<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> 

Manuel was very successful in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, Manuel participated in the building and decorating of many of the basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, where due his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the [[Byzantine rite|Greek liturgy]] each day.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref> All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with [[Raynald of Chatillon|Raynald]], Prince of Antioch, and [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]], King of Jerusalem respectively.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

===Military reform===
{{details|Komnenian army}}

Through a combination of determination, military reform, and years of campaigning, [[Alexios I Komnenos]], [[John II Komnenos]] and [[Manuel I Komnenos]] managed to restore the military power of the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> An important factor in the success of the Komnenoi was their establishment of a reconstructed Byzantine army. The new military system which they created is known as the [[Komnenian army]]. From c.1081 to c.1180, the Komnenian army played an important role in providing the empire with a period of security that enabled Byzantine civilization to flourish.<ref name=Birkenmeier>Birkenmeier, J, ''The development of the Komnenian army, 1081-1180''</ref>

===Twelfth century 'Renaissance'===
{{details|Byzantine civilisation in the twelfth century}}
[[Image:Nerezi.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'The Lamentation of Christ' (1164), a fresco from the church of Saint Panteleimon in Nerezi near [[Skopje]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. It is considered a superb example of 12th century [[Comnenus|Komnenian]] art.]]
It has recently been argued that a '12th century renaissance' occurred in Byzantium.<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref> Although the term does not enjoy widespread usage, it is beyond doubt that 12th century Byzantium witnessed major cultural developments, which were largely underpinned by rapid economic expansion. 

The 12th century was a time of significant growth in the Byzantine economy, with rising population levels and extensive tracts of new agricultural land being brought into production. Archaeological evidence from both Europe and Asia Minor shows a considerable increase in the size of urban settlements, together with a <U+2018>notable upsurge<U+2019> in new towns.<ref name=Harvey>Harvey, Alan, ''Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900-1200''</ref>  In [[Athens]] the medieval town experienced a period of rapid and sustained growth, starting in the eleventh century and continuing until the end of the twelfth century.<ref name=Harvey>Harvey, Alan, ''Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900-1200''</ref> [[Thessalonica]], the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair which attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire, 1025-1204''</ref> In [[Corinth]], silk production fuelled a thriving economy.<ref name=Harvey>Harvey, Alan, ''Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900-1200''</ref> In Asia Minor, some areas had become depopulated due to [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] raiding in the late eleventh century. Yet as the Komnenian emperors built up extensive fortifications in rural areas during the twelfth century, repopulation of the countryside took place.<ref name=Harvey>Harvey, Alan, ''Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900-1200''</ref> The rise of the Italian city-states may have been a factor in these developments; active traders at this time in the ports of the east, their activities may have stimulated economic growth. 

The new wealth being generated during this period had a positive impact on Byzantine cultural life. In artistic terms, the [[twelfth century]] was a very productive period in Byzantine history. There was a revival in the [[mosaic]] art, and regional schools of [[Architecture]] began producing many distinctive styles that drew on a range of cultural influences.<ref name=Diehl>Diehl, Charles, [http://www.myriobiblos.gr/texts/english/diel.html Byzantine Art]</ref>

According to N.H.Baynes in ''Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization'',<ref name=Baynes>Baynes, N.H, ''Economic expansion in the Byzantine empire 900-1200''</ref>

==Decline and disintegration==
===Death of Manuel Komnenos=== 
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Byzantine_Empire_(1204).jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Byzantine Empire in 1204 A.D. was divided into the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].]] -->

The 12th century was marked by a series of wars against the [[Hungarians]] and the [[Serbs]]. Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] campaigned successfully in this region, forcing the rebellious Serbs to vassalage (1150-1152) and leading his troops into Hungary. In 1168, a decisive victory near [[Zemun]] enabled him to conclude a peace by which [[Dalmatia]] and other frontier territories were ceded to him. However, from the moment of Manuel's death on [[24 September]] [[1180]], the [[Decline of the Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire began a steep decline]] that would never be reversed.<ref name=Magdalino>Magdalino, Paul, ''The empire of Manuel I Komnenos 1143-1180''</ref>

===Collapse under the Angeloi===
The Komnenos dynasty was replaced in 1185 by that of the Angeloi. The Angeloi dynasty has had an extremely poor reputation historically, with more than one historian finding them directly responsible for the collapse of Byzantine power<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

At this time in the east the Turks invaded the empire, gradually eroding Byzantine control in Asia Minor. Meanwhile in the west, the Serbs and Hungarians broke away from the empire for good, and in [[Bulgaria]] the oppressiveness of Angeloi taxation resulted in the [[Vlach-Bulgarian Rebellion]], organised in 1185 in [[Bulgaria]] by the brothers [[Ivan Asen I of Bulgaria|Asen]] and [[Theodore Peter of Bulgaria|Peter]]. The rebellion led to the establishment of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] on territory which had been vital to the empire's security in the Balkans.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref> Kaloyan of Bulgaria annexed several important cities, while the Angeloi squandered the public treasure on palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means. Control of the [[Balkans]] was vital to imperial security at this time. Byzantine authority was severely weakened, and the growing power vacuum at the centre of the empire encouraged fragmentation, as the provinces began to look to local strongmen rather than the government in Constantinople for protection.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204''</ref> This further reduced the resources available to the empire and its military system, as large regions passed outside central control.<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>

===The Fourth Crusade===
{{details|Fourth Crusade}}
The Fourth Crusade was an unparalelled military and political catastrophe for the Byzantine Empire.  The armies of the Crusade, originally planning to attack Fatimid Egypt, ended up sacking and occupying Constantinople.  The irony of sworn defenders of Christianity despoiling the largest and wealthiest city in [[Christendom]] was not lost on the Byzantines, who despised the Catholic West for centuries afterwards.

[[Image:Eug<U+00E8>ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 012.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople'', by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]], 1840]] 
Although the stated intent of the crusade was to conquer [[Egypt]], the leaders of the Crusade were placed in an extremely difficult position when they found that considerably fewer men had responded to the call for a crusade than had been expected. As a result, they could not afford to pay for the huge Venetian fleet which they had hired to take them to Egypt. The Venetians would not let the crusaders leave without paying the full amount agreed to, originally 85,000 silver marks. The crusaders could only pay some 51,000. After a period of indecision and argument between the Crusade leaders and the increasingly impatient Venetians, the Venetian Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] made a controversial new proposal - the crusaders could pay their debts by attacking the (Christian) port of [[Zara]] in [[Dalmatia]] (essentially an independent community which recognized King Emeric of Hungary as a protector, and which was previously ruled by Venice).<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref>  
   
The citizens of Zara made reference to the fact that they were fellow Catholics by hanging banners marked with crosses from their windows and the walls of the city, but nevertheless the city fell after a brief siege. Both the Venetians and the crusaders were immediately excommunicated for this by Pope [[Innocent III]].
  
In 1202, the Byzantine prince [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios Angelos]], the son of the recently deposed Byzantine emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]], offered to reunite the Byzantine church with Rome, pay the crusaders an enormous sum, and join the crusade to Egypt with a large army if the crusaders would sail to Constantinople and topple the reigning emperor. The crusaders accepted; their fleet arrived at Constantinople in late June 1203.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>  
  
The Crusaders' initial motive was to restore Isaac II to the Byzantine throne so that they could receive the support that they were promised. The citizens of Constantinople turned against emperor [[Alexios III]], who then fled. Prince Alexios was elevated to the throne as Alexios IV along with his blind father Isaac.  
  
Alexios IV realised that his promises were hard to keep, as the empire was short on funds. In fear of his life, the co-emperor asked from the crusaders to renew their contract for another six months (until April 1204). Opposition to Alexios IV grew, and one of his courtiers, Alexios Doukas (nicknamed 'Mourtzouphlos' because of his thick eyebrows), soon overthrew him and had him strangled to death. Alexius Ducas took the throne himself as [[Alexios V]]; Isaac died soon afterwards, probably naturally.<ref name=Harris>Harris, Jonathon, ''Byzantium and the Crusades''</ref>

[[Image:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|300px|right|Map to show the partition of the empire following the Fourth Crusade, c.1204.]]
  
The Catholic clergy meanwhile accused the Byzantines of being traitors and murderers since they had killed their rightful lord, Alexios IV. The churchmen used inflammatory language and claimed that "''the Greeks were worse than the Jews''", and they invoked the authority of God and the pope to take action. Although Innocent III had warned them not to attack, the papal letter was suppressed by the clergy, and the crusaders prepared to assault the Byzantine capital.
  
Eventually, the crusaders took the city on the [[April 13]]. The crusaders inflicted a horrible and savage sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were stolen or destroyed. Among the loot were four bronze horses from the Hippodrome. These were taken to Venice, where they remain to this day. Despite their oaths and the threat of excommunication, the Crusaders systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling or stealing all they could lay hands on; according to Byzantine historian Nicetas Choniates, a [[prostitute]] was even set up on the Patriarchal throne. When Innocent III heard of the conduct of his crusaders, he was appalled, saying "You vowed to liberate the Holy Land but you rashly turned away from the purity of your vow when you took up arms not against Saracens but Christians . . . The Greek Church has seen in the Latins nothing other than an example of affliction and the works of Hell, so that now it rightly detests them more than dogs".<ref name=Norwich>Norwich, John, ''A short history of Byzantium''</ref>
  
According to a prearranged treaty, the Byzantine empire was dissolved and its territories divided between Venice and the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople. The Greek Orthodox clergy were displaced by Latin Catholic clergy, while the nobility were displaced by Latin [[feudal]] barons. Byzantine exiles fled Constantinople, taking refuge in Nicaea, Trebizond, and Epirus.<ref name=Angold>Angold, Michael, ''The Byzantine Empire 1025-1204''</ref>

==The fall of the Byzantine Empire==
{{details|Decline of the Byzantine Empire}}
[[Image:Flag_of_Palaeologus_Emperor.svg|80px|thumb|left|The flag of the Empire in the late 14th century.<ref>Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry - Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', pp.106, Tiger Books International (Twickenham), 1997.</ref>]]

After the sack of Constantinople in 1204, three Byzantine [[successor state]]s were established: the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref>

The Empire of Nicaea, controlled by the [[Palaiologan dynasty]], managed to reclaim Constantinople from the Latins in 1261 and defeat Epirus. This led to a short lived revival of Byzantine fortunes under [[Michael VIII]], but the war-ravaged empire was ill-equipped to deal with the encircling enemies that now surrounded it. Much of Constantinople lay in ruins; the army was desperately short of funds; Italian merchants and their ships dominated the empire's sea-lanes; the economy was in decline; the empire's ancient frontiers had been overrun; the provinces were in disarray.<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref>

Civil war racked the empire during the 14th century. The Asian provinces were lost to the Turks, while the Serbians and Bulgarians conquered the empire's remaining territory in Europe. For a while, the empire survived simply because the Turks of [[Anatolia]] were too divided to attack. However, the unifying influence of [[Osman I]] (1258<U+2013>1326) allowed the newly founded [[Ottoman Empire]] to deprive the Byzantines of all but a handful of port cities.<ref name=Kean>Kean, Roger, ''Forgotten Power <U+2014> Byzantium <U+2014> Bulwark of Christianity''</ref>
[[Image:ShepherdByzempire1265.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Byzantine Empire in 1265 (William R. Shepherd, ''Historical Atlas'', 1911).]]
[[Image:Byzantium1400lightpurple.PNG|thumb|270px|The Byzantine Empire by the year 1400]]

The Emperors appealed to the west for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid in return for a reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the [[Holy See|See of Rome]]. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented Roman authority and the [[Latin Rite]]. Some western mercenaries arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.

The Turks had previously considered Constantinople not worth the considerable effort of conquest, but with the advent of cannon, the walls (which had been impenetrable to assault for over 1,000 years) no longer offered adequate protection against a siege.

Constantinople by this stage was underpopulated and dilapidated. The population of the city had collapsed so severely that it was now little more than a cluster of villages separated by fields. In March 1453, an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army of 85,000 men led by Sultan [[Mehmet II]] laid siege to the city. Despite a desperate last-ditch defense of the city by the massively outnumbered Christian forces (7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreign mercenaries), [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople finally fell]] to the Ottomans after a two-month siege by on Tuesday [[May 29]], [[1453]]. The last Byzantine emperor, [[Constantine XI]] Palaiologos, was last seen casting off his imperial regalia and throwing himself into hand-to-hand combat after the walls of the city were taken.

===Aftermath===
Mehmed II went on to conquer the Greek statelets of [[Mistra]] in 1460 and [[Trebizond]] in 1461. By the end of the 15th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had established its firm rule over [[Asia Minor]] and parts of the [[Balkan peninsula]]. Mehmed II and his successors continued to consider themselves proper heirs to the Byzantine Empire until the demise of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century. Meanwhile, the [[Danubian Principalities]] harbored Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles (see [[Byzantium after Byzantium]] for details).

Technically, the Byzantine Empire lived on in the city of [[Monemvasia]] in the [[Morea]], until 1471, when the titular Despot of the Morea, [[Demetrius Palaeologus]], now living in Rome under the protection of the Pope, sold it to the latter for cash. Meanwhile, his nephew, and the nephew of the last Emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaeologus]], [[Andreas Palaeologus]] had inherited the defunct title of [[Byzantine Emperor]] and used it from 1465 until his death in 1503.

At his death, the role of the emperor as a patron of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] was claimed by [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand Duke]] of [[Muscovy]]. He had married Andreas's sister, [[Sophia Paleologue]], whose grandson, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]], would become the first [[Tsar]] of [[Russia]] (tsar, also spelled ''czar'', is a term traditionally applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that [[Moscow]] was the proper heir to [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]]. The idea of the [[Russian Empire]] as the new, [[Third Rome]] was kept alive until its demise in 1917, with the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].

Empress [[Catherine the Great]] (1762-1796), launched a [[Russo-Turkish Wars|series of campaigns]] against the Ottomans to capture Constantinople and recreate the Byzantine Empire under Russian control. She commissioned the [[Sophia Cathedral]] in her imperial residence, named [[Constantine Pavlovich|her grandson]] Constantine and managed to wrest the [[Crimea]] from the Ottomans. Although the Russian armies would approach Constaninople in 1829 and 1878, the Ottoman Empire was rescued by the intervention of the [[Great Powers]] during the [[Crimean War]] and [[Congress of Berlin]].

==Legacy and importance==
[[Image:Constantinople_1453.jpg|thumb|200px|The siege of Constantinople in 1453 according to a 15th-century French miniature.]]
Byzantium was arguably the only stable state in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. Its military and diplomatic power ensured that Western Europe remained safe from many of the more devastating invasions from the east, at a time when the Western Christian kingdoms might have had difficulty containing them (this role was mirrored in the north by the [[East Slavic]] states of [[Kievan Rus'|Kiev]], [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] and [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]]). Constantly under attack during its entire existence, the Byzantine Empire shielded Western Europe from [[Persians]], Arabs, [[Seljuk Turks]], and for a time, the [[Ottomans]]. The [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]], for example, are recognised by some historians as being a key factor behind [[Charlemagne]],<ref name="Pirenne">[[Henri Pirenne|Pirenne, Henri]]

*See also ''Mohammed and Charlemagne'' (London 1939) Dover Publications (2001). ISBN 0-486-42011-6.</ref> and a huge stimulus to [[feudalism]] and [[Medieval technology|economic self-sufficiency]].<ref name="Europe"/>

For centuries, [[Derogatory use of "Byzantine"|the word ''Byzantine'' was a byword for effeminate decadence among Western historians]]. The 20th and 21st centuries, however, have seen an increased attempt by historians to understand the empire, and its impact on European civilization has only recently been recognized.

===Economy===
The Byzantine economy was the most advanced in Europe for many centuries. The Byzantine [[solidus (coin)|Solidus]] was the internationally preferred currency for 700 years, only gradually being superseded by [[Italy|Italian]] currencies (such as the [[Venetian ducat]]) after 1204. The wealth of the empire was unmatched by any state in [[Europe]], and Constantinople for centuries was one of the wealthiest cities in the world. This economic wealth was helped enormously by the fact that Byzantium was the most important western terminal of the [[Silk Road]]. It was also the single most important commercial center of Europe for much of the Medieval era, which status it held until Venice began to overtake Constantinople during the 13th and 14th centuries. 

One of the economic foundations of the empire was trade. Constantinople was located on important east-west and north-south trade routes. Trebizond was an important port in the eastern trade. The exact routes varied over the years with wars and the political situation. Imports and exports were uniformly taxed at ten percent. 

Raw silk was bought from China and India and made up into fine brocades and cloth-of-gold that commanded high prices through the world. Silk processing was an imperial monopoly, only processed in imperial factories, and sold to authorized buyers. Later, silk worms were smuggled into the Empire and the overland silk trade became less important. Other exports included gold jewelry, enameled work, and fine carvings in ivory and semi-precious stone. In other parts of the empire, wine was made and exported to the north. Furs, slaves, timber, metals, and amber were imported from the north, and dried fish from the south.  

Commercial life in the Byzantine empire was extensively and minutely regulated by the state. Interest rates, profits, and prices were set by law, and enforced through a system of guilds. There was always full employment: It was very difficult to fire an employee, and any able-bodied man who was "idle" was required to take a public-works job.  

The sack of Constantinople by Latin crusaders in 1204 was an economic catastrophe. As one [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]], [[Geoffrey of Villehardouin]], wrote of the sack of the Byzantine Capital in 1204, 

"... Never, since the world was created, had so much booty been won in any city."

By the early thirteenth century, the Crusaders had altered the trade routes to the advantage of the Italian city-states. Although the Palaiologoi took back Constantinople in 1261, the empire's economy never entirely recovered. Territorial gains by the Turks in Asia Minor forced Constantinople to look elsewhere for its food supply. For political and military reasons the weakened empire was forced to grant concessions to Italian traders, reducing tax revenues. Furthermore, the Italians had acquired silk worms, reducing the value of the imperial monopoly. For the last two centuries of its existence, the ever declining territories and revenues of the Byzantine Empire were never enough to pay for the cost of its defence. This situation greatly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire.

===Science and law===
{{Seealso|Byzantine medicine|Byzantine law}}
Byzantium played an important role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world and to [[Renaissance Italy]]. Its rich historiographical tradition preserved ancient knowledge upon which splendid art, architecture, literature and technological achievements were built. It is not an altogether unfounded assumption that the Renaissance could not have flourished were it not for the groundwork laid in Byzantium, and the flock of Greek scholars to the West after the fall of the Empire. 

The Emperor [[Justinian I]]'s formation of a new code of law, the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'', and the revisions it constantly underwent (most notably in the Macedonian Dynasty), had a clear effect on the evolution of [[jurisprudence]]. The Codex itself compiled all previous statutes of Roman emperors, paved the way for a more developed system of appeals courts and a system of [[maritime law]] which strongly influenced their modern equivalents. In this Byzantium arguably contributed more towards the evolution of jurisprudence and modern legal systems than its direct predecessor, [[Roman law]].

===Religion===
{{further|[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]}}

[[Image:Church_Palaeologus.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modern day church with the double-headed flag of the Greek Orthodox Church.]]

Religion was hugely important in Byzantine society, art and politics.  The Emperor, considered to be God's representative on Earth, was expected to administer the Church, fund monasteries and other religious buildings, and promote [[orthodoxy]]. Historians have used the term [[caesaropapism]] to describe the relationship between the Imperial administration and the Church.

The Byzantine Empire had a major influence upon [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. For the duration of the Empire, Eastern Orthodoxy developed as the form of Christianity which was mandated and supported by the Byzantine state apparatus. Its influence spread outside of the Empire's borders, eventually creating a "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]" of Orthodoxy (a term coined by 20th century historians) throughout [[Eastern Europe]]. Early Byzantine missionary work spread Orthodox Christianity to various [[Slavic peoples]], where it still is a predominant religion in countries such as [[Bulgaria]], the [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]], [[Belarus']], and [[Ukraine]]; it also remains the official religion of [[Greece]] and is closely associated with Greek culture. Byzantine religious practice also influenced [[Coptic Christianity]] in Egypt, [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Christianity]] and [[Tewahedo Church|Ethopian Christianity]], even though these groups became part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], outside of the Chalcedonian Orthodox Church.

[[Robert Byron]], a noted [[Philhellene]], argued that the greatness of Byzantium lay in what he described as "the Triple Fusion": that of a Roman body, a Greek mind and an oriental, mystical soul.

===Art, architecture, and literature===
{{Seealso|Byzantine music}}
[[Byzantine art]] and [[Byzantine architecture|architecture]] were largely based around the sacred history of the Christians. After the "Triumph of Orthodoxy" in 843, the [[icon]] assumed a central role. Byzantine architecture emphasized the dome, the arch and, in the middle and late periods, the "cross-in-square" groundplan. Church interiors were decorated with mosaics and paintings depicting saints and scenes from the Bible. The formal elements of Byzantine architecture exerted a significant influence on [[Ottoman architecture]], and Byzantine architecture and architectural decoration were further developed in medieval and early modern [[Russian architecture]]. More generally, Byzantine artistic traditions, including icon-painting, influenced the art of [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] communities in southeast Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. In the 19th and 20th centuries architects in Europe and the United States revived Byzantine forms in a style that is known as the [[Neo-Byzantine]].

The finest Byzantine literary works were hymns, such as the [[kontakion|kontakia]] of [[Romanos]] the Melode, and devotional treatises, such as ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' by [[John Climacus]]. Byzantine authors also excelled in the composition of practical treatises. A series of competent, diligent writers, both male and female, produced many works of practical value in the fields of public administration, military affairs, and the practical sciences. Among the most famous of these treatises, the ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' and the ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'', were written under the direction of [[Constantine VII]]. The theological work of such early Byzantine authors as [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] and [[John Chrysostom]] was important in the development of western thought. Byzantine historiography influenced later Russian chroniclers. 

Most of the surviving literature of the Byzantine empire was written in a self-consciously classical, or "[[Atticism|atticizing]]," style. Vernacular literature either developed more slowly than in the west, or has simply not been preserved. There is little surviving fiction, the best-known work being the epic poem [[Digenis Acritas]], which was written in something approaching the vernacular. [[Hagiography]] may have served as a popular genre of narrative literature, although most saints' lives were re-written in atticizing Greek in the 10th century under the supervision of [[Symeon Metaphrastes]]. Other major genres included historiography, biography, epistolography, and lexicography (the [[Suda]] is a particularly important example of this last category). Perhaps the Byzantine empire's greatest contribution to literature was their careful preservation of [[Ancient Greek literature]], which was thereby transmitted both to Europe and to the Islamic world, as well as compilations of works on certain subjects, with certain revisions, most notably in the fields of [[medicine]] and [[history]].

===Civil service and the government===
The Byzantine State differed from other states of its day in that it emphasized the importance of a rigid, semi-professional [[civil service]] rather than direct rule. The civil administration can largely be divided into three groups: the palatine administration, the provincial government and the central civil service. Within this context, the system can be divided into two further sub-groupings, Judicial Officers and Financial Officers who were spread across the 13 permanent Departments of State (in the Central Civil Service). 

In this, it can be said it anticipates the systems of many modern nation states, and, despite the occasionally [[Derogatory use of "Byzantine"|derogatory use of the word "Byzantine"]], it had a distinct ability for reinventing itself in accordance with the Empire's situation. In this it was far more stable than other European systems of government at the time, and contributed clearly towards the evolution of [[Political science]] and the system of government.

===Diplomacy===
Whereas classical writers are fond of making a sharp distinction between peace and war, for the Byzantines diplomacy was a form of war by other means. Anticipating [[Machiavelli]] and [[Clausewitz]], Byzantine historian [[John Kinnamos]] writes, "Since many and various matters lead toward one end, victory, it is a matter of indifference which one uses to reach it."  With a regular army that never exceeded 140,000 after the losses of the seventh century, the empire's security depended on activist diplomacy.  Byzantium's "Bureau of Barbarians" was the first foreign intelligence agency, gathering information on the empire<U+2019>s rivals from every imaginable source.<ref name="Antonucci">Antonucci, Michael, "War by Other Means: The Legacy of Byzantium," ''History Today'', February 1993, pp. 11-13, '''43''' (2)</ref>

The Byzantines were skilled at using diplomacy as a weapon of war. If the [[Bulgars]] threatened, subsidies could be given to the [[Russians]]. A Russian threat could be countered by subsidies to the [[Patzinaks]]. If the Patzinaks proved troublesome, the [[Cumans]] or [[Uzes]] could be contacted. There was always someone to the enemy<U+2019>s rear in a position to appreciate the emperor<U+2019>s largesse. Another innovative principle of Byzantine diplomacy was effective interference in the internal affairs of other states. In 1282, [[Michael VIII]] sponsored a revolt in [[Sicily]] against [[Charles of Anjou]] called the [[Sicilian Vespers]]. Emperor [[Heraclius]] once intercepted a message from Persian rival [[Khosrau II]] which ordered the execution of a general. Heraclius added 400 names to the message and diverted the messenger, provoking a rebellion by those on the list. The emperor maintained a stable of pretenders to almost every foreign throne. These could be given funds and released to wreak havoc if their homeland threatened attack.<ref name="Antonucci"/>
