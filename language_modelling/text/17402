The Japanese word {{nihongo|'''mitama'''|<U+5FA1><U+9B42><U+30FB><U+5FA1><U+970A><U+30FB><U+795E><U+970A>|honorable spirit}} refers to the spirit of a ''[[kami]]'' or the soul of a dead person.<ref>Iwanami {{nihongo|[[K<U+014D>jien]]|<U+5E83><U+8F9E><U+82D1>}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version</ref> It is composed of two characters, the first of which, {{nihongo|'''mi'''|<U+5FA1>|honorable}}, is a simply a [[honorific]]. The second, {{nihongo|'''tama'''|<U+9B42><U+30FB><U+970A>}}  means "spirit".  The character pair <U+795E><U+970A>, also read ''mitama'', is used exclusively to refer to a ''kami's'' spirit.<ref name="tama">{{EOS|Tama|1232|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}</ref> Significantly, a synonym of ''[[shintai]]'', the object which in a [[Shinto shrine]] houses the enshrined ''kami'', is {{nihongo|''mitamashiro''|<U+5FA1><U+9B42><U+4EE3>|mitama representative}}.<ref name="kas"/> 
British [[Japanologist]] [[William George Aston]] (1841-1911) believed the ''mitama'' to be comparable as a concept to the Jewish [[Shekhinah]].<ref>[[Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics]], Vol. XI, entry "Shinto"</ref> 

Early Japanese definitions of the ''mitama'', developed later by many thinkers like [[Motoori Norinaga]], maintain it consists of several "souls", relatively independent one from the other.<ref name="kas">{{cite book  | last = Smyers  | first = Karen Ann  | coauthors =   | title = The Fox and the Jewel: Shared and Private Meanings in Contemporary Japanese Inari Worship  | pages=118<U+2013>119  | publisher = University of Hawaii Press  | year = 1999  | location = Honolulu  | isbn = 0-8248-2102-5  | oclc = 231775156}}</ref>
The most developed is the ''ichirei shikon'', a [[Shinto]] theory according to which the {{nihongo|spirit|<U+970A><U+9B42>|reikon}} of both ''kami'' and human beings consists of one spirit and four souls.<ref name="ichirei">* {{EOS|Ichirei shikon|1181|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}</ref> The four souls are the ''ara-mitama'', the ''nigi-mitama'', the {{nihongo|''saki-mitama''|<U+5E78><U+5FA1><U+9B42>|happy soul}} and the {{nihongo|''kushi-mitama''|<U+5947><U+5FA1><U+970A><U+30FB><U+5947><U+5FA1><U+9B42>|wondrous soul}}. According to the theory, each of the souls making up the spirit has a character and a function of its own; they all exist at the same time, complementing each other.<ref name="ichirei"/> In the [[Nihon Shoki]], ''kami'' <U+014C>namuchi actually meets his ''kushi-mitama'' and ''shiki-mitama'', but does not even recognize them. The four seem moreover to have a different importance, and different thinkers have described their interaction differently.<ref name="kas"/> 

==''Ara-mitama'' and ''nigi-mitama''==
[[File:Aramatsuri-no-miya 01.JPG|thumb|210 px|Ise Shrine's Aramatsuri-no-miya enshrines Amaterasu's ''ara-mitama'']]
The ''ara-mitama'' is the rough and violent side of a spirit.<ref name=ara>{{cite web|last=Yonei|first=Teruyoshi|title=Aramitama|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1180|work=Encyclopedia of  Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=nigi>{{cite web|last=Yonei|first=Teruyoshi|title=Nigimitama|url=http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1470|work=Encyclopedia of  Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University|accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> A ''kami's'' first appearance is as an ''ara-mitama'', which must be pacified with appropriate pacification rites and worship so that the ''nigi-mitama'' can appear.<ref name="nigi"/><ref name="ara"/> The ''nigi-mitama'' is the normal state of the ''kami'', its functional side, while the ''ara-mitama'' appears in times of war or natural disasters.
These two souls are usually considered opposites, and Motoori Norinaga believed the other two to be no more than aspects of the nigimitama.<ref name="kas"/> ''Ara-mitama'' and ''nigi-mitama'' are in any case independent agents, so much so that they can sometimes be enshrined separately in different locations and different ''[[shintai]]''. For example, Sumiyoshi Shrine in [[Shimonoseki]] enshrines the ''ara-mitama'' of the Sumiyoshi ''kami'', while [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]] in Osaka enshrines its ''nigi-mitama''.<ref name="ara"/> Ise Shrine has a sub-shrine called Aramatsuri-no-miya enshrining [[Amaterasu]]'s ''ara-mitama''. [[Atsuta Shrine|Atsuta-jing<U+016B>]] has a ''[[Setsumatsusha|sessha]]'' called Ichi-no-misaki Jinja for her ''ara-mitama''  and a ''[[Setsumatsusha|massha]]'' called Toosu-no-yashiro for her  ''nigi-mitama''. No separate enshrinement of the ''mitama'' of a ''kami'' has taken place since the rationalization and systematization of Shinto actuated by the [[Meiji restoration]].<ref name="kas"/>

==''Saki-mitama''==
This is the soul of blessing and prosperity. In a scene of the Nihon Shoki, ''kami'' <U+014C>namuchi is described in conversation with his own ''saki-mitama'' and ''kushi-mitama''. Within Shinto also exists the idea that this the soul which brings good harvests and catches. Motoori Norinaga and others however believe this to be no more than a function of the ''nigi-mitama''.<ref>{{EOS|Sakimitama|1219|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}</ref>

==Kushi-mitama==
The "wondrous soul" which appears together with the ''saki-mitama'', the providing soul, which is the power behind the harvest. It is believed to be have mysterious powers, to cause transformations and to be able to cure illnesses.<ref>{{EOS|Kushimitama|1207|Yonei Teruyoshi|February 10, 2011}}</ref>

==Mitama Festival==

A widely celebrated [[Shinto]] festival to the dead in Japan, particularly at the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Typically in mid-July.
