'''Harry Peter "Bud" Grant, Jr''' (born [[May 20]], [[1927]]) is best known as the longtime head coach of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the  [[National Football League]].  He was the second (1967-83) and fourth (1985) head coach of the team.  In [[Canada]] he is just as well known for his success with the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].

He was born in [[Superior, Wisconsin]]. His mother called him "Buddy Boy", which later became "Bud".<ref>[http://blog.lib.umn.edu/maasx003/Vikings/043724.html Bud Grant Essay: Part One] by Roger Welk</ref>  Bud graduated from high school in 1945 and with [[World War II]] still going enlisted in the [[Navy]].  He was assigned to the [[Great Lakes Naval Training Station]], where he was coached by [[Paul Brown]].  Grant had played fullback in high school, but with a big guy named [[Marion Motley]] at fullback, Bud switched to End.  After being discharged, he attended the [[University of Minnesota]]. He starred in three sports for the [[Golden Gophers]]: [[American football]], [[basketball]], and [[baseball]].

After leaving the University of Minnesota in [[1949]], he first played professional basketball with the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Minneapolis Lakers]], averaging 2.6 ppg in his two seasons. Bud was a player on the [[Minneapolis Lakers]] [[1950]] championship team.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MNL/1950.html 1950 Minneapolis Lakers] Basketball-Reference.com</ref>  He was selected in the first round (14th overall) of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s college draft in [[1950]] by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/draft/1950.jsp The 1950 NFL Draft] Pro Football Hall of Fame website</ref>  Grant did not sign with the Eagles in [[1950]], instead he returned to the Lakers for the 1950-51 season.  Grant signed with the Eagles before the [[1951]] season.  In the [[1952]] season, his second with the Eagles, Grant ranked second in the NFL for receiving yardage, with 997 yards on 56 catches, including seven touchdowns.  Bud did not sign a contract before the 1952 season, meaning he was "playing out" the team option from his 1951 contract.  That meant that after the 1952 season Bud was a [[free agent]].

At this time, playing in Canada was just as (if not more) lucrative as playing in the United States, so in [[1953]], Bud Grant signed with the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].  He played for the Blue Bombers until [[1956]] as an offensive end and was named a Western Division all-star three times.  Grant still holds the CFL record of 5 interceptions in a playoff game (Oct. 28, 1953). <ref>[http://www.cfl.ca/index.php?module=page&id=171 Most Interceptions, Playoff Game] Official site of the Canadian Football League</ref>  In 1956 Grant was made head coach of the Blue Bombers.  He would remain the head coach of the Blue Bombers until [[1966]].  During his stint as head coach, he led the team to six [[Grey Cup]] appearances, winning the championship four times.

Grant continued his coaching success in the [[National Football League]].  Desiring to be closer to home, Grant signed on as head coach of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[1967]], taking over for original coach [[Norm Van Brocklin]].  Grant required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem and even had national anthem practice.  To get his players to deal with the cold weather, Grant refused to allow heaters on the sidelines. <ref>[http://vikings.scout.com/2/11606.html History: Bud Grant] Viking Update Staff</ref>  

In his second year, he led the team to a divisional championship.  In [[1969]], he led the team to its first NFL Championship and their first appearance in the [[Super Bowl]].  The Vikings lost in Super Bowl IV to the [[American Football League]] champion [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  The Vikings would appear in 3 more Super Bowls under Grant and lose each one.  However, he was the first coach to coach in four Super Bowls. Grant's team won 11 divisional championships between [[1968]] and [[1980]].  Bud Grant retired after the [[1983]] season and was followed in the post by [[Les Steckel]], who led the team through a 3&ndash;13 season.  Grant returned as coach for the Vikings in [[1985]] and then retired for a second time, succeeded by [[Jerry Burns]].

Bud Grant is a member of both the [[Canadian Football Hall of Fame]] and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].

Off the sidelines, Bud Grant is well known as an avid hunter and fisherman. In the early 90s, he became a spokesperson opposing certain Native American treaty rights.  This resulted in a death threat, as reported by the [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD61239F933A25752C0A965958260 NY Times].

As of 2006, Bud's son, Mike, has been the head coach for [[Eden Prairie High School]] in [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota]], for the past 15 years. In 2006, Mike's son and Bud's grandson, Ryan, is a junior at the school and is the team's quarterback.
