'''Io''' ''(eye'-oe,'' {{IPA2|<U+02C8>a<U+026A>o<U+028A>}}, Greek ''<U+1FD9><U+03CE>)'' is the innermost of the four [[Galilean moon|Galilean]] [[natural satellite|moons]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and the fourth largest moon in the [[Solar System]].  Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron (or iron-sulfide) core.  Thanks in part to this composition and tidal heating, Io has one of the most geologically active surfaces in the solar system, with over 400 active volcanoes and more than 100 mountains, some taller than Earth's [[Mount Everest]].<ref name=Lopes2004>

</ref>  Several of Io's volcanoes also produce volcanic plumes up to 500&nbsp;km (310&nbsp;mi) high, which are composed of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. These plumes produce large surface changes and provide material for Io's thin, patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere.

Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.  It was discovered, along with the other Galilean satellites, in [[1610]] by [[Galileo Galilei]].  This discovery furthered the adoption of the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]] of the Solar System, the development of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s laws of motion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. From Earth, Io remained nothing more than a point of light until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it became possible to resolve its large-scale surface features, such as the dark red polar and bright equatorial regions.  In [[1979]], the two ''[[Voyager_Program|Voyager]]'' spacecraft  revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters.  The Galileo spacecraft  performed several close flybys in the [[1990s]] and early [[2000s]], obtaining data about Io's interior structure and surface composition.  These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between the satellite and Jupiter's magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of radiation centered on Io's orbit.  The exploration of Io continued in the early months of 2007 with a distant flyby by Pluto-bound ''[[New Horizons]]''.

==Name==
While [[Simon Marius]] is not credited with the sole discovery of the Galilean satellites, his names for the moons have stuck. He named the innermost large moon of Jupiter after the [[Greek mythology|Greek mythological]] figure [[Io (mythology)|Io]], one of the many lovers of [[Zeus]] (who is also known as [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] in the [[Roman mythology]])<ref>
{{cite journal |quotes=no |last=Marius |first=S. |date=1614 |title=''Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici'' |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/marius.html }} (in which he [http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/jupiter_satellites.html attributes the suggestion] to Johannes Kepler)
</ref>. Marius' names fell out of favor, and were not revived in common use until the mid-[[20th century]]. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Io is simply referred to by its [[Roman numeral]] designation (a system introduced by Galileo) as "'''{{nowrap|Jupiter I}}'''", or simply as "the first satellite of Jupiter". The most common adjectival form of the name is ''Ionian''.

Features on Io are named after characters and places from the Io [[myth]], as well as deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'', names which are appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by ''[[Voyager 1]]'' the [[International Astronomical Union]] has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. Examples include [[Prometheus (volcano)|Prometheus]], [[Pan Mensa]], [[Tvashtar Paterae]], and [[Ts<U+0169>i Goab Fluctus]].

==Observational History==
The first reported observation of Io was made by [[Galileo Galilei]] on [[7 January]], [[1610]].  The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's ''Siderius Nuncius'' in March 1610.<ref name=IobookChap2>
{{cite book |last=Cruikshank |first=D. P. |authorlink=Dale P. Cruikshank |coauthors= and Nelson, R. M. |editor=Lopes, R. M. C.; and  Spencer, J. R. |title=Io after Galileo |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=3-540-34681-3 |pages=pp. 5-33 |chapter=A history of the exploration of Io }}
</ref> In his ''Mundus Jovialis'', published in [[1614]], Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in [[1609]], one week before Galileo's discovery. Galileo doubted this claim and dismissed the work of Marius as plagiarism. Given that he also published his discovery before Marius, Galileo is credited with the discovery.

For the next two and a half centuries, Io remained an unresolved, 5{{sup|th}}-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the [[17th Century]], Io and the other Galilean satellites served a number of practical purposes, including helping mariners determine their longitude, validating Kepler's [[Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law|Third Law of planetary motion]], and determining the light time between Jupiter and Earth.<ref name=IobookChap2/> Based on [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]] produced by astronomer [[Giovanni Cassini]] and others, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].<ref name=IobookChap2/> This resonance was later found to have a profound effect on the geologies of the three moons.

Improved telescope technology in the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed Io's disk to be resolved by astronomers. In the [[1890s]], [[Edward E. Barnard]] was the first to resolve variations Io's brightness between its equatorial and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and [[albedo]] between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer [[William Pickering]], or binary, as initially proposed by Barnard.<ref name=Barnard1894>

===''Pioneer''===
The first spacecraft to pass by Io were the twin ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' and ''[[Pioneer 11|11]]'' probes in 1973 and 1974 respectively. Radio tracking provided an improved estimate of Io's mass which, along with the best available information of Io's size, suggested that Io had the highest density of the four Galilean satellites, and was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice.<ref name=Anderson1974>Anderson, J. D.; ''et al.''; (1974); ''Gravitational parameters of the Jupiter system from the Doppler tracking of Pioneer 10'', Science, Vol. 183, pp. 322-323</ref> The ''Pioneers'' also revealed the presence of a thin atmosphere at Io and intense radiation belts near the orbit of Io. The camera on board ''Pioneer 11'' took the only good image of Io obtained by either spacecraft, showing its north polar region.<ref name=Pioneer11image>[http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/io/pioio.html ''Pioneer 11 Images of Io''] (Retrieved [[April 21]], [[2007]])</ref>

[[Image:Io_VGR_South_polar_color_mosaic.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mosaic of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' images covering Io's South Polar Region]]

===''Voyager''===
The twin probes ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' passed by in 1979, their more advanced imaging system allowing for far more detailed images. ''Voyager 1'' flew past the satellite on [[March 5]], [[1979]] from a distance of 20,600&nbsp;km (12,800&nbsp;mi).<ref name=VoyagerDesc>[http://pds-rings.seti.org/voyager/mission/ ''Voyager Mission Description''] (Accessed [[April 21]], [[2007]])</ref> The images returned during the approach revealed a strange, multi-colored landscape devoid of impact craters.<ref name=Smith1979>[[Bradford A. Smith|Smith, B. A.]]; ''et al.''; (1979); ''The Jupiter system through the eyes of Voyager 1'', Science, Vol. 204, pp. 951-972</ref> The highest resolution images showed a relatively young surface punctuated by oddly-shaped pits, mountains taller than Mount Everest, and features resembling volcanic lava flows. 

Shortly after the encounter, ''Voyager'' navigation engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a "plume" emanating from the surface in one of the images.<ref name=Morabito1979>Morabito, L. A.; ''et al.''; (1979); ''Discovery of currently active extraterrestrial volcanism'', Science, Vol. 204, p. 972</ref> Analysis of other ''Voyager 1'' images showed nine such plumes scattered across the surface, proving that Io was volcanically active.<ref name=Strom1979>Strom, R. G.; ''et al.''; (1979); ''Volcanic eruption plumes on Io'', Nature, Vol. 280, pp. 733-736</ref> This conclusion was predicted in a paper published shortly before the ''Voyager 1'' encounter by Stan J. Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds. The authors calculated that Io's interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede.<ref name=Peale1979a>Peale, S. J.; ''et al.''; (1979); ''Melting of Io by Tidal Dissipation'', Science, Vol. 203, pp. 892-894</ref> Data from this flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and [[sulfur dioxide]] frosts, compounds that also dominate its thin atmosphere, and the torus of plasma centered on Io's orbit (also discovered by ''Voyager'').<ref name=Soderblom1980>Soderblom, L.

''Voyager 2'' passed Io on [[July 9]], [[1979]] at a distance of 1,130,000&nbsp;km (702,150&nbsp;mi). Though it did not approach nearly as close as ''Voyager 1'', comparisons between images taken by the two spacecraft showed several surface changes that had occurred in the five months between the encounters. In addition, dedicated high-phase observations of Io revealed that eight of the nine plumes observed in March were still active in July 1979, with only [[Pele (volcano)|Pele]] shutting down between flybys.<ref name=Strom1982>Strom, R.

===''Galileo''===
To follow up on the discoveries of the two ''Voyager'' probes and ground-based observations taken in the intervening years, the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] arrived at Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth. Io's location within one of Jupiter's most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but ''Galileo'' did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system.  While no images were taken during the close flyby on [[December 7]], [[1995]], the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found in the rocky planets of the inner solar system.<ref name=Anderson1996>Anderson, J. D.; ''et al.''; (1996); ''Galileo Gravity Results and the Internal Structure of Io'', Science, Vol. 272, pp. 709-712</ref>

Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during ''Galileo's'' primary mission.  For example, ''Galileo'' observed the effects of a major eruption at [[Pillan Patera]] and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with [[mafic]] to ultramafic compositions with sulfur and sulfur dioxide serving a similar role to water and [[carbon dioxide]] on Earth.<ref name=Mcewen1998>McEwen, A. S.; ''et al.''; (1998); ''High-temperature silicate volcanism on Jupiter's moon Io'', Science, Vol. 281, pp. 87-90</ref> Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the primary mission, revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma on the surface and volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the ''Voyager'' and ''Galileo'' eras and between ''Galileo'' orbits.<ref name=IobookChap3>{{cite book |last=Perry |first=J.; ''et al.'' |editor=Lopes, R. M. C.; and Spencer, J. R. |title=Io after Galileo |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=3-540-34681-3 |pages=pp. 35-59 |chapter=A Summary of the Galileo mission and its observations of Io }}</ref> 

The ''Galileo'' Mission was twice extended, in 1997 and 2000. During these extended missions, the probe flew by Io three times in late 1999 and early 2000 and three times in late 2001 and early 2002. Observations during these encounters revealed the detailed nature of the geologic processes occurring at Io's volcanoes and mountains, excluded the presence of a magnetic field, and demonstrated the extent of volcanic activity.<ref name=IobookChap3/>  In [[December 2000]], joint observations of Io were made by ''Galileo'' and the [[Cassini-Huygens|''Cassini'']] spacecraft (making a distant encounter with Jupiter en route to [[Saturn]]), revealing a new plume at [[Tvashtar Paterae]].<ref name=Porco2003>[[Carolyn C. Porco|Porco, C. C.]]; ''et al.''; (2003); ''Cassini imaging of Jupiter's atmosphere, satellites, and rings'', Science, Vol. 299,  pp. 1541-1547</ref>

Following ''Galileo''<U+2019>s fiery demise in Jupiter's atmosphere in [[September 2003]], new observations of Io's volcanism predominately came from [[adaptive optics]] imaging from the [[Keck telescope]] in [[Hawaii]].<ref name=Marchis2005>Marchis, F.; ''et al.''; (2005); ''Keck AO survey of Io global volcanic activity between 2 and 5 <U+03BC>m'', Icarus, Vol. 176, pp. 96-122</ref> This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, even without a spacecraft in the Jupiter system.  The ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft, en route to [[Pluto]] and the [[Kuiper Belt]], flew by the Jupiter system and Io on [[February 28]], [[2007]]. During the encounter, numerous distant observations of Io were obtained. Early results include images of a large plume at Tvashtar, providing the first detailed observations of the largest class of Ionian volcanic plume since observations of Pele's plume in 1979.<ref name=NHTvashtarimage>[http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/gallery/missionPhotos/pages/031307.html ''A Midnight Plume''] (accessed [[April 21]], [[2007]])</ref>  ''New Horizons'' also captured images of a volcano near [[Girru Patera]] in the early stages of an eruption, and several volcanic eruptions that have occurred since ''Galileo''. The only forthcoming mission planned for the Jupiter system, ''[[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]'', does not have an imaging system powerful enough to perform Io surface science. Missions to Europa and Ganymede currently in the concept study phase may be able to study Io before starting their primary mission at their respective targets, but, as of 2007, they are at least a decade from arriving at Jupiter.<ref name=Moomaw2007>Moomaw, B.; [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Spaceships_Or_Flagships_For_Science_Or_Glory_999.html ''Spaceships Or Flagships For Science Or Glory''], Spaceblogger.com ([[10 April]] [[2007]]; accessed [[April 21]], [[2007]])</ref>

==Orbit==
Io orbits Jupiter at a distance of 421,700&nbsp;km (262,000&nbsp;mi) from the planet's center and 350,000&nbsp;km (217,000&nbsp;mi) from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its orbit lying between those of [[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]] and Europa. It takes  42.5 hours to revolve once (fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation). Io is in a 2:1 mean motion [[orbital resonance]] with Europa and a 4:1 mean motion orbital resonance with Ganymede, completing two orbits of Jupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by Ganymede. This resonance helps maintain Io's orbital eccentricity (0.0041), which in turn provides the primary heating source for its geologic activity.<ref name=Peale1979a/> Like the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the Earth's [[Moon]], Io rotates [[Tidal locking|synchronously]] with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter.

Io plays a significant role in shaping the Jovian magnetic field.  The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1 ton per second.<ref name=IobookChap11>{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=N.

These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, ultimately end up in various neutral clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere, and in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.

Surrounding Io (up to a distance of 6 Io radii from the moon's surface) is a cloud of neutral sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and potassium atoms.  These particles originate in Io's upper atmosphere but are excited from collisions with ions in the plasma torus (discussed below) and other processes into filling Io's [[hill sphere]].  Some of this material escapes Io's gravitational pull, and goes into orbit around Jupiter.  Over a 20-hour period, these particles form a banana-shaped neutral cloud that can reach as far as 6 Jovian radii from Io, either inside Io's orbit and ahead of the satellite or outside Io's orbit and behind the satellite.<ref name=IobookChap11/>  The collisional process that excites these particles also occasionally provides sodium ions in the plasma torus with an electron, removing those new "fast" neutrals from the torus.  However, these particles still retain their velocity (70 km/sec. compared to the 17 km/sec. orbital velocity at Io), leading these particles to be ejected in jets leading away from Io.<ref name=Burger1999>{{cite journal | last=Burger |first=M.

Io orbits within a belt of intense radiation known as the Io Plasma Torus.  The plasma in this donut-shaped ring of ionized sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine originates when neutral atoms in the "cloud" surrounding Io are ionized and carried along by the Jovian magnetosphere.<ref name=IobookChap11/>  Unlike the particles in the neutral cloud, these particles co-rotate with Jupiter's magnetosphere, revolving around Jupiter at 74 km/sec.  Like the rest of Jupiter's magnetic field, the plasma torus is tilted with respect to Jupiter's equator (and Io's orbital plane), meaning Io is at times below and at other times above the core of the plasma torus.  As noted above, these ions' higher velocity and energy levels are partly responsible for the removal of neutral atoms and molecules from Io's atmosphere and more extended neutral cloud.  The torus is composed of three sections: an outer, "warm" torus that resides just outside Io's orbit, a vertically extended region known as the "ribbon" composed of the neutral source region and cooling plasma at around Io's distance from Jupiter, and an inner, "cold" torus, composed of particles that are slowly spiraling in toward Jupiter.<ref name=IobookChap11/>  After residing an average of 40 days in the torus, particles in the "warm" torus escape and are partially responsible for Jupiter's unusually large [[magnetosphere]], their outward pressure inflating it from within.<ref name=Krimigis2002>Krimigis, S.

The plasma torus emits light at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, allowing researchers to monitor variations in the plasma torus.

Jupiter's [[magnetic field]] lines, which Io crosses, couples Io to Jupiter's polar ionosphere through the [[induction|generation]] of an [[electric current]] known as the [[Io Flux Tube]].<ref name=IobookChap11/>  This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter's polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io's atmosphere.  Particles from this auroral interaction act to darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths.  The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to the Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on the Jovian [[radio]] emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably.<ref name=IobookChap11/><sup>,</sup><ref name=Bigg1964/>  The ''Juno'' mission, planned for the next decade, should help to shed light on these processes.

==Structure==
[[Image:PIA01129 Interior of Io.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Model of the possible interior composition of Io]]
===Interior===
Composed primarily of [[silicate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[iron]], Io is closer in bulk composition to the terrestrial planets, than to other satellites in the outer solar system, which are mostly composed of a mix of water ice and silicates.  Io has a density of 3.5275 grams per cubic centimeter, the highest of any moon in the [[Solar System]], significantly higher than the other Galilean satellites, and higher than the Earth's moon.<ref name=Schubert2004>{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=J.

Modeling of Io's interior composition suggests that the mantle is composed of at least 75% of the magnesium-rich mineral [[forsterite]], and has a bulk composition similar to that of [[L_chondrite|L-chondrite]] and [[LL_chondrite|LL-chondrite]] [[meteorites]], with higher iron content (compared to [[silicon]]) than the [[Moon]] or [[Earth]], but lower than [[Mars]].<ref name=Sohl2002>Sohl, F.

Unlike the Earth and the Moon, Io's main source of internal heat comes from [[Tidal force|tidal]] dissipation rather than radioactive [[isotope]] decay.<ref name=Peale1979a/>  Such heating is dependent on Io's distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state.<ref name=IobookChap5/>  Its [[orbital resonance|Laplace-resonant orbit]] with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit.  The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge of as much as 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft). The friction produced in Io's interior due to the varying tidal pull from Jupiter between the [[periapsis]] and [[apoapsis]] points in Io's orbit is enough to cause significant tidal heating within Io's interior and creating a significant amount of melt.  This heat is then released from the interior in the form of volcanic activity and generates its high [[Heat transfer|heat flow]] (global total: 0.6-1.6{{e|14}}&nbsp;[[watt|W]]).<ref name=IobookChap5/>  Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time, and that the current heat flow is not representative of the long-term average.<ref name=IobookChap5/>

[[Image:Iosurface gal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Io exhibits extraordinary variations in color and brightness as shown in this color-enhanced image.]]

===Surface===
Based on their experience with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous [[impact crater]]s in ''Voyager 1'''s first images of Io.  The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to the moon's age.  However, they were surprised to discover that the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows.  Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten [[orange (fruit)|orange]] or to [[pizza]]) from various sulfurous compounds.  The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface, with volcanic materials continuously burying craters as they are produced.  This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by ''Voyager 1''.

In addition to volcanoes, Io's surface includes non-volcanic mountains, numerous lakes of molten sulfur, [[caldera]]s up to several kilometers deep, and extensive flows of low-viscosity fluid (possibly some form of molten sulfur or silicate) which stretch for hundreds of kilometers.

[[Image:Galileo_Io_Pele_color.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Color image of Io's trailing hemisphere,  highlighting the large red ring around the volcano [[Pele (volcano)|Pele]]]]
====Surface composition====
Io's colorful appearance is the result of various materials produced by its extensive volcanism.  These materials include silicates (such as [[orthopyroxene]]), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide.<ref name=IobookChap9>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=R. W.; ''et al.'' |editor=Lopes, R. M. C.; and Spencer, J. R. |title=Io after Galileo |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=3-540-34681-3 |pages=pp. 194-229 |chapter=Io's surface composition }}</ref>  Sulfur-dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials.  Sulfur is also seen in many places across the satellite, forming yellow to yellow-green regions.  Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often radiation damaged, breaking up normally stable 8-chain sulfur.  This radiation damage produces Io's red-brown polar regions.<ref name=Barnard1894/>

Explosive volcanism, often taking the form of umbrella-shaped plumes, paint the surface with sulfurous and silicate materials.  Plume deposits on Io are often colored red or white depending on the amount of sulfur and sulfur dioxide in the plume.  Generally, plumes formed at volcanic vents from degassing lava contain a greater amount of S<sub>2</sub>, producing red "fan" deposit, or in extreme cases, large (often reaching beyond 450&nbsp;km (280&nbsp;mi) from the central vent) red rings.  A prominent example of a red ring plume deposit is located at Pele.  These red deposits consist primarily of sulfur (generally 3- and 4-chain molecular sulfur), sulfur dioxide, and perhaps Cl<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=IobookChap9/>  Plumes formed at flow fronts (through the interaction of lava and pre-existing deposits of sulfur and sulfur dioxide), produce white or gray deposits.

Compositional mapping and Io's high density suggests that it contains little to no [[water]], though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain [[Gish Bar Mons]].<ref name=Doute2004>Dout<U+00E9>, S. ''et al.'' (2004). ''Geology and activity around volcanoes on Io from the analysis of NIMS spectral images''. Icarus '''169''', 175-196.</ref> This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early in the evolution of the solar system to drive off the volatile elements in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.

====Volcanism====
{{Main|List of paterae on Io}}
The tidal heating produced by Io's forced orbital eccentricity has led the moon to become one of the most volcanically active worlds in the solar system, with hundreds of volcanic centers and extensive lava flows.  During a major eruption, lava flows tens or even hundreds of kilometers long can be produced, consisting mostly of basaltic or ultramafic silicate lavas.  As a by-product of this activity, sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas and pyroclastic material are blown up to 500&nbsp;km (310&nbsp;mi) into space producing large, umbrella-shaped plumes, painting the surrounding terrain in red, black, and white, and providing material for Io's patchy atmosphere and Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere.

Io's surface is dotted with volcanic depressions known as paterae.<ref name=Radebaugh2001>{{cite journal | last=Radebaugh |first=J. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Paterae on Io: A new type of volcanic caldera? |journal=J.

These features resemble terrestrial [[caldera]]s, but it is unknown if they are produced through collapse over an emptied lava chamber as with their terrestrial cousins.

Lava flows represent another major volcanic terrain on Io.  Magma erupts onto the surface from vents on the floor of paterae or on the plains from fissures, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at [[Kilauea]] in Hawaii.  Images from the ''Galileo'' spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major lava flows, like those at at [[Prometheus (volcano)|Prometheus]] and at [[Amirani (volcano)|Amirani]] are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava flows on top of older flows.<ref name=Keszthelyi2001>{{cite journal | last=Keszthelyi |first=L. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Imaging of volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io by Galileo during the Galileo Europa Mission and the Galileo Millennium Mission |journal=J.

A major eruption in 1997 produced more than 3,500&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,350&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) of fresh lava as well as flooding the floor of the adjacent Pillan Patera.<ref name=Mcewen1998/>  

[[Image:Tvashtarvideo.gif|left|thumb|200 px|Sequence of ''[[New Horizons]]'' images showing Io's volcano Tvashtar spewing material 330 km above its surface.]]
Analysis of the ''Voyager'' images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur.  However, subsequent Earth-based [[infrared]] studies and measurements from the ''Galileo'' spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions.  This hypothesis is based on temperature measurements of Io's "hotspots," or thermal emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least {{nowrap|1200 K}} and some as high as {{nowrap|1800 K}}.<ref name=Mcewen1998/>  

The discovery of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki were the first sign that Io is geologically active.<ref name=Morabito1979/>  Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io's volcanoes at speeds reaching 1&nbsp;km/s (0.62&nbsp;mps).

Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than 1000&nbsp;km (620&nbsp;mi& in diameter.  Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and [[Dazhbog Patera|Dazhbog]].  Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide, sending the sulfur skyward.

Io has 100 to 150 mountains.

Despite the extensive volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all its mountains are tectonic structures, and are not produced by volcanoes.  Instead, most Ionian mountains form as the result of compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io's crust through [[Thrust_faults|thrust faulting]].<ref name=SchenkBulmer1998>{{cite journal | last=Schenk |first=P.

Mountains on Io (generally, structures rising above the surrounding plains) have a variety of morphologies.  [[Plateau]]s are most common.<ref name=Schenk2001/>  These structures resemble large, flat-topped mesas with rugged surfaces.  Other mountains appear to be tilted crustal blocks, with a shallow slope from the formerly flat surface and a steep slope of consisting of formerly sub-surface materials uplifted by compressive stresses.  Both types of mountains often have steep [[scarp]]s along one or more margins.  Only a handful of mountains on Io appear to have a volcanic origin.  These mountains resemble small shield volcanoes with steep slopes (6-7<U+00B0>) near a small, central caldera, and shallow slopes along their margins.<ref name=Schenk2004>{{cite journal | last=Schenk |first=P.

Other shield volcanoes with much shallower slopes are inferred from the morphology of several of Io's volcanoes, where thin flows radiated out from a central patera, such as at Ra Patera.<ref name=Schenk2004/>

Nearly all mountains appear to be in some stage of degradation.  Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation.  Scalloped margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.<ref name=Moore2001>{{cite journal | last=Moore |first=J.

[[Image:Io Aurorae color.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Auroral glows in Io's upper atmosphere.  Different colors represent emission from different components of the atmosphere (Green comes from emitting sodium atoms, red from emitting oxygen atoms, and blue from emitting volcanic gases like Sulfur dioxide).

===Atmosphere===
Io has an extremely thin [[celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide ({{chem|SO|2}}) with a pressure of a billionth of an [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].<ref name=Pearl1979>{{cite journal | last=Pearl |first=J. C. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Identification of gaseous {{chem|SO|2}} and new upper limits for other gases on Io |journal=Nature |volume=288 |issue= |pages=757-758 |date=1979 |url= |doi = }}</ref> The thin Ionian atmosphere means any future landing probes sent to investigate Io will not need to be encased in an aeroshell-style heatshield, but instead require [[retrorocket]]s for a soft [[landing]]. The thin atmosphere also necessitates a rugged lander capable of enduring the strong Jovian [[radiation]], which a thicker atmosphere would attenuate.

The same radiation (in the form of a [[magnetosphere|plasma]]) strips the atmosphere so that it must be constantly replenished.<ref name=IobookChap10>{{cite book |last=Lellouch |first=E.; ''et al.'' |editor=Lopes, R. M. C.; and Spencer, J. R. |title=Io after Galileo |year=2007 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |isbn=3-540-34681-3 |pages=pp. 231-264 |chapter=Io's atmosphere }}</ref> The most dramatic source of {{chem|SO|2}} is volcanism, but the atmosphere is largely sustained by sunlight-driven sublimation of {{chem|SO|2}} frozen on the surface.  The atmosphere is largely confined to the equator, where the surface is warmest and the majority of active volcanic plumes reside.<ref name=Feldman2000>{{cite journal | last=Feldman |first=P. D. |coauthors=''et al.'' |title=Lyman-<U+03B1> imaging of the {{chem|SO|2}} distribution on Io |journal=Geophys. Res. Lett. |volume=27 |issue= |pages=1787-1790 |date=1979 |url= |doi = }}</ref>  Other variations also exist, with the highest densities near volcanic vents (particularly at sites of volcanic plumes) and on Io's anti-Jovian hemisphere (the side that faces away from Jupiter, where {{chem|SO|2}} frost is most abundant).<ref name=IobookChap10/>

High resolution images of Io show an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like glow. As on Earth, this is due to radiation hitting the atmosphere. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks a magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact the satellite's atmosphere. More electrons collide with the atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to the satellite (i.e., near the equator), since the column of gas they pass through is longer there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to "rock" with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole.<ref name=equatorialspot>Retherford, K. D.; ''et al.''; [http://www.agu.org/journals/ja/ja0012/2000JA002500/pdf/2000JA002500.pdf ''Io's Equatorial Spots: Morphology of Neutral UV Emissions''] [[JGR|Journal of Geophysical Research]], Vol. 105, No. A12 ([[December 1]], [[2000]]), pp. 27,157-27,165</ref>
