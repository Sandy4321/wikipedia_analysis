The '''Siskiyou Mountains''' are a [[Coast Ranges|coastal]] [[mountain range]] in the northern [[Klamath Mountains]] in northwestern [[California]] and southwestern [[Oregon]] in the [[United States]]. They extend in an arc for approximately {{convert|100|mi|km}} from east of [[Crescent City, California]], northeast along the north side of the [[Klamath River]] into [[Josephine County, Oregon|Josephine]] and [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson]] counties in Oregon. The mountain range forms a barrier between the [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] of the Klamath River to the south and the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] to the north.

These mountains are not the highest or most dramatic in the Klamath Mountains but are subtly beautiful, botanically diverse, and the wildest the region has to offer. Due to the [[Orographic lift|relief]] so close to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the peaks receive more [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] than the surrounding land. This leads to forests that grow with heavy vegetation.<ref>http://conifercountry.com/nwCalifornia/climate.html</ref> [[Biodiversity|Diversity]] abounds because western canyons can receive over {{convert|100|in|mm}} of rain in some winters while eastern areas are slightly more arid. Because the Siskiyous trend both north and south and then east and west, it holds species that range from coastal, like [[coast redwood]], to Cascadian, like [[Alaska yellow-cedar]] and [[Pacific silver fir]]. 

Much of the range is within the [[Rogue River <U+2013> Siskiyou National Forest|Rogue River <U+2013> Siskiyou]] and [[Klamath National Forest|Klamath]] national forests. The [[Pacific Crest Trail]] follows a portion of the ridge of the range. The [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests]] are noted for their high [[biodiversity]].

== Name origins ==
The origin of the word ''siskiyou'' is not known. One version is that it is the [[Chinook Jargon]] word for "bob-tailed horse." According to historian Richard Mackie, "Siskiyou" was a [[Cree]] word for a bob-tailed horse,<ref>{{cite web | title = Mount Shasta Annotated Bibliography | year = 2001 | url = http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/bib/B7.htm | accessdate = 7 May 2012}}</ref> one of which perished in 1829 during [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod's]] journey over a pass later named for the "siskiyou" (today's [[Siskiyou Summit|Siskiyou Pass]]). The Cree were in the area as part of McLeod's [[Hudson's Bay Company]] expedition, and had been recruited far away in their homeland in eastern Canada.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mackie |first= Richard Somerset |title= Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific 1793-1843 |year= 1997 |publisher= University of British Columbia (UBC) Press |location= Vancouver |isbn= 0-7748-0613-3 |page=66}}</ref> Another version, given in an argument before the State Senate in 1852, is that the French name ''Six Cailloux'', meaning "six-stones," was given to a ford on the [[Umpqua River]] by [[Michel Laframboise]] and a party of Hudson's Bay Company [[Animal trapping|trappers]] in 1832, because six large stones or rocks lay in the river where they crossed.<ref>{{cite web | title = How did our 58 counties get their names? | year = 2012 | url = http://www.counties.org/default.asp?id=56 | accessdate = 7 May 2012}}</ref>  According to some, the ''Six Cailloux'' name was appropriated to this region by [[Stephen Meek]], another Hudson's Bay Company trapper who was known for his "discovery" of [[Scott Valley]], in regard to a crossing on the [[Klamath River]] near [[Hornbrook, California|Hornbrook]]. Still others attribute the name to a local tribe of [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]].

==Geography==
The highest peaks in the range include [[Mount Ashland]] at elevation {{convert|7533|ft|m}},<ref name = "USDAFS">{{cite web | title = Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest: About the Forest | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/home/?cid=stelprdb5305069 | accessdate = 7 May 2012}}</ref> [[Dutchman Peak]] at {{convert|7410|ft|m}}, [[Siskiyou Peak]] at {{convert|7147|ft|m}}, and [[Wagner Butte]] at {{convert|7140|ft|m}}, all of which are in Oregon.<ref name = "LaLande1995">{{cite web | title = An Environmental History of the Little Applegate River Watershed | last = LaLande | first = Jeff | date = September 1995 | url = http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/020912c1.pdf | accessdate = 10 May 2012}}</ref> The highest peak in the California portion of the range is [[Preston Peak]] at {{convert|7309|ft|m}}. The main drainages in the mountains are the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] drainage and the [[Klamath River]] drainage.<ref name = "Anderson1997">{{cite web | title = Siskiyou Ecological Province | last = Anderson | first = William | last2 = Borman | first2 = Michael | last3 = Krueger | first3 = William | year = 1997 | url = http://oregonstate.edu/dept/range/sites/default/files/EcologicalProvincesOfOregon/siskiyou.htm | accessdate = 10 May 2012}}</ref>

===Siskiyou Summit===
{{main|Siskiyou Summit}}
<!--[[File:SiskiyouSummitOregon.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Siskiyou Summit in Summer 2009 {{Deletable image-caption|date=April 2012}}]]-->
[[Interstate 5]] passes through the Siskiyou Mountains at Siskiyou Summit, located just north of the Oregon/California border, and just south of [[Ashland, Oregon]]. Siskiyou Summit is the highest pass on Interstate 5, at {{convert|4310|ft|m}}. This pass is one of the most treacherous in the Interstate highway system. The [[California]] side has a more gradual ascent/descent, but on the Oregon side of the pass (the side which is more hazardous), the freeway gains (loses) {{convert|2300|ft|m}} in elevation over a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of freeway. In addition, the pass includes several hazardous curves, and is frequently hit with bad weather (including snow, ice, and fog) during winter storms. During winter, it is common for the highway to be closed one to four times by transportation authorities due to hazardous conditions. The speed limit is {{convert|55|mph|km/h}}, but lower limits are set for larger vehicles.

==Climate==
The climate of the mountains is distinctive in how it varies from the coast to the inland slopes. Generally, it can be said that the mountains have milder temperatures and more rainfall near the coast.<ref name = "USDAFS"/>  However, the mountains produce a great difference in interior and coastal climates. The interior tends to be drier and warmer in the Summer months, but the eastern slopes resemble an interior climate.<ref name = "Whittaker1960">{{cite journal | title = Vegetation of the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon and California | last = Whittaker | first = R.H. | journal = Ecological Monographs | year = July 1960 | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 279&ndash;338 | url = http://www.orww.org/Wildfires/Biscuit/References/Whittaker_1960.pdf | accessdate = 7 May 2012 | archiveurl = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0012-9615%28196007%2930%3A3%3C279%3AVOTSMO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G | archivedate = 2003}}</ref>

The coast tends to have around {{convert|60|in|cm|}} of rainfall a year, rising to {{convert|100|in|cm|}} of rainfall at the peaks. The arid eastern areas receive around {{convert|30|in|cm|}} annually.<ref name = "USDAFS"/> Rainfall is heaviest in the winter and lightest in the summer.<ref name = "Whittaker1960"/> Fogs provide an additional source of water at low elevations especially during the summer. Most precipitation in the lower elevations is from rain; however, at higher elevations snow becomes a major source of water.<ref name = "USDAFS"/>

Snowfall can occur in the higher reaches because of the lower temperatures that occur there.<ref name = "USDAFS"/> Temperature trends actually tend to lie parallel to the coast, because of the ocean's major influence.<ref name = "Whittaker1960"/> The mean annual temperature is around {{convert|11.0|to|11.5|C|F|}} in the low elevations; however, higher in the mountains and further east, the temperatures range from minimums just above freezing to highs around {{convert|21.0|to|23.0|C|F|}}.

==Ecology and protection==
[[File:Red Buttes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Red Buttes Wilderness|Red Buttes]] in the Siskiyou Mountains]]There is considerable [[biodiversity]] within the Siskiyou Range, including extensive forests. Forests vary by elevation and relative locations, being primarily divided into [[California mixed evergreen forest|Mixed Evergreen Forests]], [[Montane ecology#Montane forests|Montane Forests]], and Subalpine Forests.<ref name = "Whittaker1960"/>

===Flora===
The occurrences of tree species are divided by these forest types. Exceptions to this exist. [[Coast Douglas-fir]] ''(Pseudotsuga menziesii'' subsp. ''menziesii)'' occurs in both Mixed Evergreen and Montane Forests. [[Lawson's Cypress]] (also known as Port Orford Cedar, ''Chamaecypraris lawsoniana'') occurs throughout the range west of the summit.<ref>{{cite web | title = Port Orford Cedar: an American Wood | last = Ohmann | first = Janet | year = 1984 | url = http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/usda/amwood/228porto.pdf | accessdate = 12 May 2012}}</ref> [[White Fir]] ''(Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowina)'' occurs in Montane and Subalpine Forests above {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. In the Montane Forest, occurring in the snowzone, [[Sugar Pine]] ''(Pinus lambertiana)'' also occurs. The subalpine forests above {{convert|5000|ft|m}} include [[Mountain Hemlock]] ''(Tsuga mertensiana)'' and [[Red Fir|Shasta Red Fir]] ''(A. magnifica'' subsp. ''shastensis)'' in addition to Douglas-fir.<ref name = "Anderson1997"/> [[Ponderosa Pine]] ''(Pinus ponderosa)'' is only dominant in Montane Forests on steep south facing slopes but also grows with Black Oak and in Mixed Evergreen Forests.<ref name = "Warring1968">{{cite web | title = Forest Plants of the Eastern Siskiyous | last = Warring | first = R | year = 1968 | url = http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/org_nws/NWSci%20journal%20articles/1960-1969/1969%20vol%2043/43-1/p01%20Waring.pdf | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> Rare [[Pacific Yew]] ''(Taxus brevifolia)'' grow at low elevations or at higher elevations near sources of water. Other conifers include [[Weeping Spruce]] ''(Picea breweriana)'', an endemic species,<ref name = "SisCrest">{{cite web | title = Siskiyou Crest: Climate Refuge | year = 2009 | url = http://www.siskiyoucrest.org/campaign.html | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and [[Coast Redwood]] ''(Sequoia sempervirens)''.

Various deciduous broadleaf trees grow in addition to the conifers. The largest extant [[Quercus kelloggii|Black oak]], ''Quercus kelloggii'', is found in the Siskiyou Mountains.<ref>John O. Sawyer, Andrea J. Pickart (2001) ''Trees and Shrubs of California'', University of California Press, 467 pages ISBN 0-520-22109-5</ref> The [[Blue Oak]], ''Quercus douglasii'', is beyond its contiguous range; however, there are disjunctive populations of Blue Oak within the Siskiyou Mountains.<ref>C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=85046 ''Blue Oak: Quercus douglasii'', ed. N. Stromberg]</ref>

[[Invasive species]] have become a concern in some areas. Some of these include [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] and [[Cytisus scoparius|scotch broom]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Noxious Weed Control | year = 2011 | url = https://fsplaces.fs.fed.us/fsfiles/unit/wo/secure_rural_schools.nsf/a8428fdd759191a988256cf0007dd6d2/0034eb5f4404c2f18525777b0054f0dc?OpenDocument | accessdate = 19 May 2012 }}</ref> Starthistle has become a problem in the Siskiyous only in the last twenty years.<ref = "USFSStar">{{cite web | title = Starthistle | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5316224 | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref> It has little value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants.<ref name = "Orloff">{{cite web | title = Management of Yellow Starthistle in Siskiyou County | last = Orloff | first = Steve | last2 = Drake | first2 = Dan | url = http://users.sisqtel.net/armstrng/Orloff2%20nox%20weeds.pdf | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref> [[Lythrum salicaria|Purple Loosestrife]] is a plant that is invasive to waterways.<ref name = "USFSPurp">{{cite web | title = Purple Loosestrife | url = http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/maps-pubs/?cid=stelprdb5316191 | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref>

===Fauna===
The diversity of [[fauna]] in the region is exhibited by the number of [[amphibian]], [[reptile]],<ref name = "Bury1999">{{cite journal | title = Klamath-Siskiyou Hepetofauna: Biogeographic Patterns and Conservation Strategies | last = Bury | last2 = Pearl | first2 = Christopher | journal = "Natural Area Journal" | volume = 19 | pages = 341<U+2013>350 | year = 1999 | url = ftp://ftp.blm.gov/pub/blmlibrary/UserRequests/Jorgensen/01.pdf | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> and [[Bird|avian]] species in the region.<ref name = "Alexander1999">{{cite web| title = Bird-Habitat Relationships In The Klamath/Siskiyou Mountains | last = Alexander | first = John | year = 1999 | url = http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/040226a1.pdf | accessdate = 12 May 2012}}</ref> Many of the amphibian and reptiles are [[Endemism|endemic]] species.<ref name = "Bury1999"/> The [[eponymous]] [[endangered]] [[Siskiyou Mountains salamander]] is found within this mountain range;<ref name = Yorke>{{cite web | title = Plethodon Stormi: The Siskiyou Mountain Salamander | last = Yorke | first = Nicole | url = http://biology.uoregon.edu/reference/herpetology/documents/yonke.pdf | accessdate = 12 May 2012}}</ref> in addition there is also the [[Plethodon asupak|Scott Bar Salamander]].<ref name = "kswild">{{cite web | title = The Klamath-Siskiyou Region | url = http://kswild.org/ksregion | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> The variety of habitats in the mountains contributes to the number of bird species in the area, because the birds have more variety of habitat available to them.<ref name = "Alexander1999"/> However, many birds disperse from the area following the breeding season.<ref name = "Werschkul1983">{{citation | title = Birds and Small Mammals of Southwestern Oregon: the Tanoak Forest | last = Werschkul | first = David | last2 = Swisher | first2 = Otis | date = 15 January 1983 | url = http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/031201a1.pdf | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> These birds include the endangered [[Spotted Owl]], which lives in the elevations up to {{convert|5800|ft|m}}.<ref name = "fwsOwl2012">{{cite web | title = Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Revised Critical Habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl | year = 2012 | url = https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2012/03/08/2012-5042/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-revised-critical-habitat-for-the-northern-spotted-owl | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> Endangered salmon live in the Rouge and Klamath watersheds.<ref name = "SisCrest"/>

Mammals in the area include small rodents, deer and elk, and bear and coyote.<ref name = "Werschkul1983"/> Medium sized mammals also live in the region, including [[red fox]], [[gray fox]], and [[weasel]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Siskiyou Crest National Monument America<U+2019>s First Climate Refuge | date = January 2010 | url = http://www.siskiyoucrest.org/download/SCNMprofile.pdf | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref> Another rare animal is the [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], a predatory medium sized mammal that lives in old growth forest.

===Conservation===
The Siskiyou range has federal protection in several forms.  [[Oregon Caves National Monument]] protects {{convert|488|acre|km2|0}} in the northern part of the range south of [[Grants Pass, Oregon]].<ref name = "NPS2010">{{cite web | title = Listing of Acreage | date = 31 December 2010 | url = http://www.nature.nps.gov/stats/Acreage/acrebypark10cy.pdf | accessdate = 13 May 2012}}</ref>  The [[Cascade<U+2013>Siskiyou National Monument]] protects {{convert|52940|acre|km2|0}} at the junction of the Siskiyou and Cascade Ranges.

==History==
Natives speaking the [[Athabaskan languages|Athapaskan Language]] lived along the Rouge River prior to 1850. These settlements were primarily winter residences, and the people likely spent much of the summer in the mountains.<ref>{{Cite Web| title = Indian Villages in Southwestern Oregon | last = Allen | first = Cain | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=573EAAC7-A48E-8CE6-1511AD6D7001438D}}</ref>

===Early exploration and Establishing Presence===
Most early exploration of the area came from the coast, beginning in 1775 when the Spanish lieutenant [[Bruno de Heceta]] [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|came to the Northwest]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Indians of Southwest Oregon: an Ethnohistorical Review | last = LaLande | first = Jeff | year = 1989 | url = http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/021211a1.pdf | accessdate = 12 May 2012}}</ref> He would be followed in 1791-1792 by other explorers like captain [[George Vancouver]], James Baker, and [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]]. The early [[Exploration of North America#Overland exploration of the West|western overland expeditions]] all avoided the area around the Oregon-California Border, so that the first land based expeditions came when the [[North West Company]] came to the area in 1820 followed by the [[Hudson Bay Company]] in 1821.

[[File:Siskiyou Trail.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Siskiyou Trail.]]
{{main|Siskiyou Trail}}
The Siskiyou Trail stretched from [[Central Valley (California)|California's Central Valley]], through the Siskiyous, to Oregon's [[Willamette Valley]]. Originally based on existing [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] foot trails winding their way through river valleys, the Siskiyou Trail provided the shortest practical travel path between early settlements in California and Oregon in the 1820s.

===New Settlement and Early Industry===
As settlement increased with a variety of new incentives, tensions over relations with the natives increased. In the 1850s, following the [[Donation Land Claim Act]],<ref name = "Cessna2011">{{cite web | title = The Pursuit of Commerce: Agricultural Development in Western Oregon, 1825-1861 | last = Smith | first = Cessna | year = 2011 | url = http://dr.archives.pdx.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/psu/7006/Smith_psu_0180E_10226.pdf?sequence=1 | accessdate  = 19 May 2012}}</ref> settlers came to the area to [[Gold prospecting|prospect for gold]]. The new settlements grew enough for Jackson County to be founded, with its seat in Jacksonville.<ref name = "Davidson2005">{{cite web | title = Guide to the Jackson County, Oregon Records: 1853<U+2013>1920 | last = Davidson | first = Hugh | last2 = Schlimgen | first2 = Veta | last3 = Hale | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Parlet | first4 = Tanya | year = 2005 | url = http://nwda-db.wsulibs.wsu.edu/findaid/ark:/80444/xv16766 | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref> [[Native Americans in the United States#Resistance|deteriorated]] the relationship with the natives in the area.<ref name = "Tveskov2001">{{cite web | title = Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail | last = Tveskov | first = Mark | last2 = Derr | first2 = Kelly | last3 = Norris | first3 = Nicole | last4 = Silva | first4 = Richard | year = 2001 | url = http://www.sou.edu/anthropology/Tveskov_etal_SiskiyouTrail.pdf | accessdate = 17 May 2012}}</ref> Mines opened up as various [[Gold mining in the United States#Oregon|claims]] were made.

The new population needed to be supported by an improved infrastructure. By 1859 the trail had been replaced by a toll road. A [[Telegraphy|telegraph line]] was built over the summit in 1864.<ref name = "Tveskov2001"/> By the end of the 1870s the first private lumber mills were established in the mountains had been established in some of the lower creeks.<ref name = "Lamm1957">{{cite web | title = Lumbering in Klamath | last = Lamm | first = W.E. | year = 1957 | url = http://scholarsarchive.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/10176/Lum_Kal.pdf?sequence=1 | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref> Commercial orchards began to be planted in 1885.<ref name = "JacksonCount2010">{{cite web | title = Jackson County Rural Living Handbook | date = January 2010 | url = http://www.jswcd.org/Files/Rural%20Living%20Handbook%20FINAL12172009.pdf | accessdate = 19 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] was completed over Siskiyou Summit in 1887.<ref name = "Tveskov2001"/> The new railroads were focused around [[Medford, Oregon|Medford]].<ref name = "Davidson2005"/>

===Industry develops===
