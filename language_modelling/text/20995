'''Charles Leo "Gabby" Hartnett''' (December 20, 1900 <U+2013> December 20, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional baseball|professional]] [[baseball]] player and [[manager (baseball)|manager]].<ref name="Gabby Hartnett statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/hartnga01.shtml |title=Gabby Hartnett statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=12 February 2011 }}</ref> He played almost his entire career in [[Major League Baseball]] as a [[catcher]] for the [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1922 to 1940. He spent the final season of his career as a player-coach for the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in 1941. After his playing career, he continued his involvement in baseball as a coach and as a minor league manager.

Hartnett was an all-around player, performing well both offensively and defensively.<ref name="Backstop: a history of the catcher and a sabermetric ranking of 50 all-time greats">{{Citation |first=McNeil | last=William |year=2006 |title=Backstop: a history of the catcher and a sabermetric ranking of 50 all-time greats |publisher=McFarland Publishing |isbn=978-0-7864-2177-0 |url=http://books.google.com.sa/books?id=xUtA_LRW2aoC&lpg=PA24&dq=greatest%20catchers%20of%20all%20time&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q=greatest%20catchers%20of%20all%20time&f=false |quote=}}</ref> Known for his strong and accurate throwing arm, he routinely led the [[National League]]'s catchers in [[caught stealing]] percentage and was the first major league catcher to hit more than 20 home runs in a season.<ref name="Backstop: a history of the catcher and a sabermetric ranking of 50 all-time greats"/> During the course of his career, he took part of some of the most memorable events in Major League Baseball history including; [[Babe Ruth's Called Shot]], [[Carl Hubbell]]'s strike out performance in the 1934 All-Star game and [[Dizzy Dean]]'s career-altering injury during the 1937 All-Star game. But the greatest moment of Hartnett's career came with one week left in the 1938 season, when he hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to put the Cubs into first place. The event, which occurred as darkness descended onto Wrigley Field, became immortalized as the ''Homer in the Gloamin'''.

Until the career of [[Johnny Bench]], Hartnett was considered the greatest catcher in the history of the [[National League]].<ref name="Gabby Hartnett">{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/gabby-hartnett-hof.htm |title=Gabby Hartnett |publisher=entertainment.howstuffworks.com |accessdate=12 February 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-jIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12&dq=gabby+hartnett+baseball+digest&hl=en&ei=4CxWTajuLtOUtwfhm42jDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Superstars of the 70's Who Will They Be? |author=Vass, George |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=November 1969 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=12 February 2011 }}</ref> A six-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], he appeared in four World Series during his playing career.

The young catcher had a disapointing year in [[1926 Chicago Cubs season|1926]] as his batting average dropped to .275 with only 41 runs batted in.
