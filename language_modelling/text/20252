'''Mineral Point''' is a city in [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The city is located within the [[Mineral Point (town), Wisconsin|Town of Mineral Point]]. Mineral Point is part of the [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] [[Madison, Wisconsin metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. One of Wisconsin's oldest cities, Mineral Point was settled in 1827, becoming a [[lead]] and [[zinc]] mining center during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today the city's historical character has made it a regional tourist destination. The population was 2,487 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

== History ==
The first European settlement at Mineral Point began in 1827. One of the first settlers to the area was [[Henry Dodge]] and his family who settled a few miles away from Mineral Point.<ref>[[#refFiedler1973|Fideler 1973]], p. 25.</ref> During the following year, large quantities of [[galena]], or [[lead]] ore, were discovered around the settlement in shallow deposits. Lead had many uses at the time, and settlers began to flock to the region hoping to make a living by extracting the easily accessible mineral. Lead deposits extended throughout an area that also included [[Dubuque, Iowa]] and [[Galena, Illinois]], but Mineral Point became the center of lead mining operations within the bounds of present day Wisconsin (then part of [[Michigan Territory]]). By 1829, the region's growing population led to the creation of [[Iowa County, Wisconsin|Iowa County]], which included all of the lead mining lands within the borders of Michigan Territory at the time. Mineral Point was established as the [[county seat]] later that year. During the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832, residents of Mineral Point built [[Fort Jackson (Wisconsin)|Fort Jackson]] to protect the town from a possible attack.<ref>[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.36.</ref> The young settlement's importance was further confirmed in 1834 when it was selected as the site of one of two federal land offices responsible for distributing [[Public domain (land)|public land]] to settlers within the area that now encompasses Wisconsin.

When [[Wisconsin Territory]] was created in 1836, Mineral Point hosted the [[inauguration]] of the first territorial governor, [[Henry Dodge]], and the territorial secretary, [[John S. Horner]]. During the ceremony, a design by Horner was officially recognized as the Great Seal of Wisconsin Territory. It displayed an arm holding a [[pickaxe]] over a pile of lead ore, demonstrating the importance of Mineral Point's early mining economy to the new territory. A census conducted in the months after the inauguration showed that Iowa County had  5,234 inhabitants, making it the most populous county in the Wisconsin Territory east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[[#refThwaites1895|Thwaites 1895]], p.249.</ref>

Mineral Point remained an important lead mining center during the 1840s. Although the most easily accessible lead deposits on the surface were being exhausted by this time, new immigrants began to arrive with more refined techniques for extracting ore. The largest group came from [[Cornwall]], which had been a mining center for centuries. Experienced [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners were attracted to the lead mining opportunities in Mineral Point, and by 1845 roughly half of the town's population had [[Cornish American|Cornish ancestry]].<ref>[[#refNesbit1989|Nesbit 1989]], p.114.</ref> The original dwellings of some of these early [[Cornish American|Cornish]] immigrants have been restored at the [[Pendarvis]] Historic Site in Mineral Point. Lead continued to be produced in abundant quantities by the [[Cornish American|Cornish]] miners, and in 1847, the ''Mineral Point Tribune'' reported that the town's furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900&nbsp;kg) of lead each day.<ref>[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.84.</ref>

Mining activity in Mineral Point began to decline in the following years. In 1848, the same year that Wisconsin achieved statehood, [[gold]] was discovered in [[California]]. Many experienced miners left Mineral Point to look for gold, and in all, the town lost 700 people during the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.95.</ref> While the lead industry in Mineral Point continued into the 1860s, the town never recovered its former importance. A further blow was struck in 1861 when the county seat of Iowa County was relocated to nearby [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin]], where it remains today. Afterwards there was an intense rivalry between the two cities, during which{{When|date=June 2010}} Mineral Point fired a cannon towards Dodgeville's direction.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

As lead mining declined in Mineral Point, [[zinc]] mining and [[smelting]] became important new industries. Zinc ore was discovered with increasing frequency near the bottoms of old lead mines. The Mineral Point Zinc Company was founded in 1882, and by 1891 it was operating the largest [[zinc oxide]] works in the United States at Mineral Point.<ref>[[#refFiedler1973|Fiedler 1973]], p.147.</ref> Zinc mining and processing continued on a large scale until the 1920s.

It is well documented that Mineral Point is the fourth oldest city in Wisconsin--- one behind Shullsburg, Wisconsin.
