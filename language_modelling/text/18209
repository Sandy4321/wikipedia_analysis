'''Hull City Association Football Club''' is an [[England|English]] [[football (soccer)|football]] club based in [[Kingston upon Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. The club participates in the [[Football League Championship]], the second tier of English football. Founded in 1904, the highest position Hull City have ever finished in the English Football League was 3rd in the [[Football League Second Division|second division]] of the old Football League. Their greatest achievement in cup competitions came in 1930, when the team reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]].

The club play their home games at the [[KC Stadium]] in Hull. The club previously played at [[Boothferry Park]], but moved to their current home in 2002, with Boothferry Park set for demolition. They traditionally play in black and amber, often with a striped shirt design, hence their nickname ''The Tigers''. The club's mascot is known as [[Roary the Tiger]].

==History==

Hull City Association Football Club was founded in [[June]] [[1904]]. For some years prior to this, attempts were made to found a [[football (soccer)|football]] club, but in a city dominated initially by [[rugby league]] with teams such as [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]] and [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull KR]], who were both respectable teams, this proved difficult.<ref name="1904-1915: The Formative Years">{{cite web

Hull City's first season as a professional football club consisted only of friendly matches, as due to the time of founding, Hull were unable to apply for membership to [[The Football League]] for the [[1904-05 in English football|1904<U+2013>05]] season.<ref name="1905-6 Part 1">{{cite web

Hull's first competitive football game was in the [[FA Cup]], but they were eliminated, after a replay, in the preliminary round against [[Stockton F.C.|Stockton]], the score was 7-4 on aggregate. After disputes with landlords at The Boulevard, Hull City moved to Anlaby Road Cricket Ground.<ref name="1904-1915: The Formative Years"/> After having played 44 friendly fixtures the previous season, Hull City were finally entered into the [[Football League Second Division]] for the [[1905-06 in English football|1905<U+2013>06 season]].<ref name="HULL CITY fchd">{{cite web

The following season a new ground was built for Hull City across the road from the cricket ground. Still under the managership of [[Ambrose Langley]], Hull continued to finish consistently in the top half of the table. They came agonisingly close to promotion in the [[1909-10 in English football|1909<U+2013>10]] season, recording what would be their highest ever finish in their history. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], missing promotion on goal average by the slim margin of 0.29 of a goal.<ref name="HULL CITY fchd"/>

The low ebb saw the arrival of unlikely looking saviours in the form of a chairman (Don Robinson) and manager ([[Colin Appleton]]) from the footballing outpost of [[Scarborough F.C.]] Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a young team featuring the likes of future England international [[Brian Marwood]], future England manager [[Steve McClaren]], fearsome centre-forward [[Billy Whitehurst]], and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by 1 goal the following season, Appleton left to manage [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]].

Hull reached the Second Division in 1985 under new player-manager [[Brian Horton]]. They defied the odds to stay there for the next five years before finally going down in 1991, by which time the club's manager was [[Terry Dolan (football manager)|Terry Dolan]]. Hull finished 14th in the Third Division in the [[1991-92 in English football|1991<U+2013>92]] season,<ref name="Final 1991/1992 English Division 3 (old) Table">{{cite web

In their first season in the rebranded division, Hull narrowly avoided another relegation but the board kept faith in Dolan and over the next two seasons they achieved secure mid table finishes. But terrible form in [[1995-96 in English football|1995-96]] condemned Hull to relegation to Division Three.<ref name="1980-1997: Robinson the Saviour - Boring, Boring Dolan">{{cite web

The club was purchased by former [[tennis]] player [[David Lloyd]] in 1997 and sacked Dolan as manager, who was replaced with [[Mark Hateley]] as boss after Hull could only finish in 17th place in the table in the [[1996-97 in English football|1996<U+2013>97]] season.<ref name="1997-2000: Saved? and Future Prospects"/><ref name="Final 1996/1997 Football League Two Table">{{cite web

After this feat, Joyce was perhaps unlucky to be replaced in April 2000 by the experienced [[Brian Little]].<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

Little breathed new life into Hull and managed to get good results out of the players, despite briefly being locked out of [[Boothferry Park]] by the bailiffs and with liquidation looking a real possibility. Hull qualified for the Division Three playoffs in [[2000-01 in English football|2000-01]], losing in the semi finals. A boardroom takeover by former Leeds United commercial director [[Adam Pearson]] had eased the club's precarious financial situation and all fears of closure were banished.<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

[[Image:Bothferry.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Boothferry Park]] in 2007.]]
The new chairman ploughed funds into the club, allowing Little to rebuild the team. Hull occupied the Division Three promotion and playoff places for much of the [[2001-02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02]] season, but Little was sacked two months before the end of the season and Hull slipped to 11th under his successor [[Jan M<U+00F8>lby]].<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

Hull began the [[2002-03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03]] season with a terrible start, which saw relegation look more likely than promotion and M<U+00F8>lby was sacked in October as Hull languished fifth from bottom in the league. [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] was named as Hull's new manager and in December 2002, just two months his appointment, Hull relocated to the impressive new 25,400-seater [[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]] after 56 years at [[Boothferry Park]].<ref name="History Of The Tigers"/>

The two seasons which followed the opening of the new stadium were hugely successful. Hull were Division Three runners-up in [[2003-04 in English football|2003<U+2013>04]] and League One runners-up in [[2004-05 in English football|2004<U+2013>05]] - back-to-back promotions - which took them into the Championship, the second tier of English football.<ref name="Final 2003/2004 Football League Two Table">{{cite web

Hull City did not wear a crest on their team shirt until [[1947]]. This crest depicted a tiger's head in a yellow-shaded badge, which was worn up till [[1955]], when it was changed to just the tiger's head. This was worn for four years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in [[1971]], the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club initials 'HCAFC' were shown for five years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the clubs name underneath was used from [[1980]] until [[1998]].

During [[World War II]], Anlaby Road was damaged by the Blitz, with repairs costing in the region of <U+00A3>1,000. The Cricket Club had served notice to quit at the same time and in 1943, the tenancy was officially ended.<ref name="Anlaby Road"/> Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 due to the destruction of Anlaby Road by the German bombing, and the poor condition of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road.<ref name="The Boulevard"/>

Hull decided to continue with the development of the stadium at Boothferry Road and plans were commissioned. The work did not commence until 1932 because of financial problems, after only the terracing was started and the pitch was laid out. Due to a proposal to build a multi-purpose sports stadium on the site, the plans were temporarily thrown into doubt. However, as a reasonable price was not offered for the site, Hull decided to continue with the plans and development restarted in 1939. The ground was opened under the name of [[Boothferry Park]] on [[31 August]] [[1946]].
