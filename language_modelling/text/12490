<tt>'''.sj'''</tt> is the [[Internet]] [[country code top-level domain|country code]] [[top-level domain]] (ccTLD) reserved for the designation [[Svalbard and Jan Mayen]]. The [[domain name registry]] is [[Norid]], but <tt>.sj</tt> is not open for registration. The issuing of the domain was based on the [[ISO 3166]] designation of Svalbard and Jan Mayen, which consists of two separately administrated integrated territories of Norway: the Arctic archipelago [[Svalbard]] and the nearly uninhabited volcanic island [[Jan Mayen]]. <tt>.sj</tt> was designated on 21 August 1997, at the same time as [[Bouvet Island]] was allocated <tt>[[.bv]]</tt>. Both were placed under the <tt>[[.no]]</tt> registry Norid, which is also the sponsor. Norwegian policy states that <tt>.no</tt> is sufficient for those institutions connected to both Svalbard and Jan Mayen, and therefore the domain is not open to registration. It is Norwegian policy not to commercialize domain resources, so there are no plans to sell <tt>.sj</tt>. Should the domain later come into use, it will be under regulation of the [[Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority]] and follow the same policy as <tt>.no</tt>.

==History==
Svalbard and Jan Mayen are two independent integrated territories of Norway. The [[Svalbard Treaty]] grants Norway full [[sovereignty]] of Svalbard,<ref name=treaty>{{cite news |title=Svalbard Treaty |publisher=[[Governor of Svalbard]] |url=http://www.sysselmannen.no/hovedEnkel.aspx?m=45301 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref> but the archipelago holds [[list of special entities recognized by international treaty or agreement|special status]] as among other things a [[free economic zone]] and is not part of the [[European Economic Area]] and the [[Schengen Area]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lovdata.no/all/tl-19921127-109-0.html |title=Lov om gjennomf<U+00F8>ring i norsk rett av hoveddelen i avtale om Det europeiske <U+00F8>konomiske samarbeidsomr<U+00E5>de (E<U+00D8>S) m.v.

==Policy==
Management of <tt>.sj</tt> lies with the [[Trondheim]]-based Norid, which is also the domain name registry for <tt>.no</tt> and the unused <tt>.bv</tt>. Norid is a limited company owned by [[Uninett]], which is again owned by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norid.no/omnorid/index.en.html |title=About Norid |publisher=[[Norid]] |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> The legal right to manage the domains is two-fold, based both on an agreement with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) and regulations under the ''Telecommunication Act'' which is supervised by the [[Lillesand]]-based Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority.<ref>Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority (2002): 26</ref>

The policy for use of <tt>.sj</tt> is regulated by the ''Regulation Concerning Domain Names Under Norwegian Country Code Top-level Domains'', also known as the ''Domain Regulation''. This regulation also regulates Norway's other two ccTLDs, <tt>.bv</tt> and <tt>.no</tt>. Should <tt>.sj</tt> later come unto use, the same rules and procedures currently regarding <tt>.no</tt> would be used for <tt>.sj</tt>.<ref>Norwegian Post and Telecommunications Authority (2002): 42</ref> The domain remains reserved for potential future use. Sale of the two unused ccTLDs has not been an item to consider for policymakers, as commercialization the domain resources is in direct contradiction to Norwegian policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norid.no/omnorid/bv-sj.en.html |title=The .bv and .sj top level domains |publisher=[[Norid]] |date=3 August 2010 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref>
