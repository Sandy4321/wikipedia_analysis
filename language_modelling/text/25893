'''''Henner's Lydia''''' ({{OCLC|193672}}) is a 1936 children's story book written and illustrated by [[Marguerite de Angeli]], who later won the [[Newbery Medal]] for excellence in [[United States|American]] [[children's literature]] for another book, her 1950 ''[[The Door in the Wall]]''. ''Henner's Lydia'' is a story about a young [[Amish]] girl named Lydia Stoltzfus and her "Pop" Henner, or Henry. The story is set in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]]. 

The landscape portrayed in the author's illustrated end papers of the book can be easily discerned the real landscape today, but for the movement of the location of a small stone quarry in the illustration, probably for artistic balance. Many of illustrations in the book were sketched by the author at the site of the [http://www.wikimapia.org/#y=40146077&x=-75948315&z=14&l=0&m=h&v=2 little red schoolhouse] that still stands at the intersection of PA route 23 and Red Schoolhouse Road west of [[Morgantown, Pennsylvania]].
