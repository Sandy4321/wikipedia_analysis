"'''Monster'''" is a song by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]], from her third [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' (2009). Inspired by her "Fear of Attachment Monster",<ref name="sex">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/458779/lady-gagas-monster-is-about-the-fear-of-attachment.jhtml |title=Lady Gaga's 'Monster' Is About The Fear Of Attachment |format=video |publisher=[[MTV]] ([[MTV Networks]]) |date=2009-11-23 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> the record was written by Gaga, [[RedOne]] and [[Space Cowboy (musician)|Space Cowboy]], with RedOne [[record producer|producing]] the track. Gaga had explained that "Monster" describes her fear of sex and relationships, and described the lyrics as being in love with the bad boy all the time, but instead of running away, one keeps going back to the same person. She added that the fear in "Monster" erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. Incorporating the usage of heavy bass lines, descending keyboard lines and "massive" choruses, "Monster" contains zombie like [[metaphors]], and a reference to Gaga's debut single "[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]".

"Monster" received generally positive reviews from critics who appreciated the song's musical arrangement and frequently rated it as a top track from ''The Fame Monster'', while some disliked its lyrics. "Monster" enjoyed brief commercial success in 2010, charting on four [[record chart|singles charts]], as well as the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and [[Latin Pop Airplay]]. Gaga has mostly performed "Monster" on her 2009<U+2013>11 [[The Monster Ball Tour]]. The performance included the portrayal of [[homicide]] and was criticized following a real-life incident at  Manchester in the United Kingdom. She also performed "Monster" on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.
