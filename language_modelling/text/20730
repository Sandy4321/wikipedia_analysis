The Republican gubernatorial primary took place on June 8, 2010, and Haley captured 49% of the vote, necessitating a runoff election on June 22.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sordid S.C. governor's race heads to runoff |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37577412/ns/politics-decision_2010/|work=MSNBC.com|agency=Associated Press|date=June 9, 2010}}</ref> Haley won handily in the runoff vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP: Republicans tap Haley for gov, make history |url=http://www.thestate.com/2010/06/22/1345251/ap-republicans-tap-haley-for-gov.html|publisher=The State|date=June 22, 2010}}</ref>

Haley was elected governor on November 2nd, 2010 over the Democratic candidate, Vincent Sheheen 51% to 47%.

===Racial commentary against Haley===
On June 3, 2010, on the internet political talk show Pub Politics, State Senator [[Jake Knotts]], a South Carolina lawmaker and supporter of Haley opponent [[Andre Bauer]], repeatedly referred to Haley as a "[[raghead]]" because of her Sikh background (male Sikhs wear turbans as part of their religious uniform). Knotts said "We've already got a raghead in the White House, we don't need another raghead in the governor's mansion."  The Republican state legislator later apologized for the slur, saying the remarks about President [[Barack Obama]] and state Rep. Nikki Haley were meant as a joke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wciv.com/news/stories/0610/742951.html |title=Senator Refers to Nikki Haley as 'Raghead'&#124;ABC News 4 |publisher=Wciv.com |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2010-06-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>Hutchins, Corey.

Haley campaign manager Tim Pearson called Knotts "an embarrassment to our state and to the Republican Party." Jenny Sanford, the former First Lady of South Carolina reaffirmed her support for Haley stating that "I can't help but think that these attacks are being leveled at Nikki Haley because of the courageous stands she has taken over the years in defense of taxpayers and government reform - stands that offend many of the most powerful interests in state government. I am more convinced than ever that Nikki Haley is the best person to be South Carolina's next Governor."<ref>Alongi, Paul.
