The '''F-35 Lightning II''', formerly known as the ''Joint Strike Fighter'' (''JSF''), is a [[military]] [[fighter aircraft]] whose development was funded by the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and other partner governments; and which was designed and built by an industry team led by [[Lockheed Martin]] that includes [[Northrop Grumman]], [[BAE Systems]], and [[Smiths Aerospace]]. The F-35 is expected to enter U.S. service in 2011.

The F-35 is a multi-role [[strike fighter]], a plane that can perform [[close air support]], tactical bombing, and air-to-air combat. [[Stealth technology]] makes the plane hard to detect as it approaches [[X-band radar|X-band]] short-range tracking radar, although it is much more easily spotted by X-band to its rear, and is not stealthy to [[L band]] long-range radar.

In a bid to save money, the F-35 is to be built in three variants: the conventional takeoff and landing ([[CTOL]]) F-35A for the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] (USAF); the short takeoff vertical landing ([[STOVL]]) F-35B for the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[Royal Navy]] (RN); and the [[aircraft carrier|carrier]]-based (CV) F-35C for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] (USN). The variants share more than 80% of their parts.  

The F-35 is intended to replace current combat jets, particularly the [[VTOL|vertical take off and landing]] (VTOL) Harrier jump jets: the USMC [[AV-8 Harrier II]], RAF [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7/9]], and the RN [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]], along with the conventional USAF [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] and  [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and the USMC [[F/A-18 Hornet]]. The F-35 is to begin replacing A-10s and F-16s in 2011, and AV-8Bs and F/A-18s in 2012.

The designation "F-35" was chosen by the Department of Defense; in proper sequence, the aircraft should have been designated "F-24", following the [[YF-23 Black Widow II]]. 
==International participation==

The primary customers and financial backers are the United States and the United Kingdom. Eight other countries are helping to fund the plane's development and will decide in 2006 whether to purchase it. There are three levels of international participation. The United Kingdom is the sole level I partner, contributing a little over [[US dollar|US$]]2 [[billion]]. Level II partners are [[Italy]], US$1 billion; and the [[Netherlands]], US$800 million. At level III are [[Turkey]], US$175 million; [[Australia]], US$144 million; [[Norway]], US$122 million; [[Denmark]], US$110 million; and [[Canada]], US$100 million. The levels generally reflect the financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the order in which countries can obtain production aircraft. [[Israel]] and [[Singapore]] have also joined as Security Cooperative Participants.<ref>Katherine V. Schnasi [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04554.pdf Joint Strike Fighter Acquisition: Observations on the Supplier Base] ''US Accounts Office''. Retrieved Feb. 08, 2006.</ref>

Some of the partner countries have wavered in their public commitment to the JSF program, hinting or warning that unless they receive more subcontracts or technology transfer, they will forsake JSF purchases for the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[JAS-39 Gripen|Gripen]] or [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]]. 

===United Kingdom participation===
{{main|Joint Combat Aircraft}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has spent US$2 billion (GPB <U+00A3>1.08 Billion) on developing the project. Britain has also worked for five years for an [[ITAR]] waiver to allow greater technology transfer associated with the project. The effort, backed by the Bush administration, has been repeatedly blocked by U.S. Representative [[Henry Hyde]] because of his concern about potential technology transfer to third countries.<ref>Spiegel, Peter, MSNBC [http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:E7c2TgkVc2YJ:www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10164422/ UK denied waiver on US arms technology].

Retrieved May 27, 2006</ref>

The CEO of [[BAE Systems]] [[Michael Turner (businessman)|Mike Turner]], the British contractor on the plane, had complained that the U.S. has not given the UK (and his company) access to the crucial [[source code]] of the plane's software, thus making it impossible for the UK to maintain and modify the JSF independently. On [[21 December]] [[2005]] an article was published in the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' saying that MPs viewed as "unacceptable" the U.S. refusal to grant access to the source code. The article quoted the chairman of the [[Defence Committee|Commons Defence Select Committee]] as saying that unless the UK receives assurances of access to the software information, "the UK might have to consider whether to continue in the programme".<ref>UK Defense Committee Statement [http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/defence_committee/def051220___no__13.cfm MoD 'slippage' set to leave forces with reduced capability, says committee] ''UK Parliament''. Retrieved Feb. 08, 2006.</ref> 

Following on from this [[Lord Drayson]], [[Defence Procurement Agency|Minister for Defence Procurement]], while on a government visit to [[Washington]] to speak to members of [[Congress]], took a firmer stance. He was quoted as saying, <nowiki>"We do expect [the software] technology transfer to take place. But if it does not take place we will not be able to purchase these aircraft"</nowiki>, and has mentioned that there is a 'plan B' if the deal falls through. <ref> Matt Chapman [http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2152035/joint-strike-fighter Britain warns US over jet software codes] ''vunet.com'' Retrieved March. 16 2006.</ref> A suggested likely option was the development of a navalised [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]]. Mike Turner has said it was not what he recommend, but:
:''"as Lord Drayson has made clear, there needs to be a fall-back in case something goes wrong.''<ref>Turner, Mike (2006).[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmdfence/uc824-iii/uc82402.htm Evidence to UK Defence Select Committee]. Retrieved Apr. 1, 2006.</ref> 
A navalised Typhoon would have required the RN's [[CVF]] aircraft carriers to be built with [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]]s, adding considerably to their cost.

===Australian participation===
In May 2005 the [[Australia|Australian]] government announced that it was delaying a final decision on the JSF from the initial 2006 decision date to 2008 (and thus past the term of the present government). [[RAAF|Royal Australian Air Force]] opinion remains strongly in favor of the JSF. There are some concerns amongst Australian media, lobby groups and politicians, who have raised doubts that the aircraft will be ready in time to replace the aging Australian air force fleet of [[General Dynamics F-111]] strike aircraft and F/A-18 Hornet fighters.  

Concerns have been raised over cost efficiency, [[dogfight]]ing capability, short range (somewhat shorter than the [[F-22 Raptor]]) and lack of [[supercruise]]. Some advocates of an F-22 purchase also claim that the cost of purchasing mature F-22 Raptors may not be that much greater than the JSF.<ref>Related discussions and analyzes on [http://www.ausairpower.net Air Power Australia web site].</ref> These claims are currently being examined in a parliamentary inquiry.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jfadt/adfair/subs.htm Inquiry into Australian Defence Force Regional Air Superiority], Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Trade, Australian Parliament</ref>

==Program history==
[[Image:JSF competitors.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Boeing X-32]] (left) and Lockheed Martin X-35 prior to down-select in 2001, where the X-35 was chosen. DoD photo]]
The Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program was created in 1993, implementing one of the recommendations of a [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) "Bottom-Up Review."  (The review also led the Pentagon to continue the [[F-22]] and F/A-18E/F programs, cancel the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) and the A/F-X programs, and curtail [[F-16]] and F/A-18C/D procurement.)

The JAST program office was established on [[January 27]], [[1994]], to develop [[aircraft]], [[weapons|weapon]], and [[radar|sensor technology]] with the aim of replacing several U.S. and UK airplanes with a family of aircraft.

Two contracts to develop prototypes were awarded on [[16 November]] [[1996]]; one each to Lockheed Martin and [[Boeing]]. Each firm would produce two aircraft to demonstrate conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL), carrier takeoff and landing (CV version), and short takeoff and vertical landing ([[STOVL]]).

Also in 1996, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] launched the [[Joint Combat Aircraft|Future Carrier Borne Aircraft]] project. This program sought a replacement for the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] (and later the [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier GR7]]); the Joint Strike Fighter was selected in January 2001.

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:First F-35A.jpg|thumb|250px|The first F-35A leaves Lockheed Martin]]  -->
The contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) was awarded on [[26 October]], [[2001]], to Lockheed Martin, whose X-35 beat the [[Boeing X-32]]. DoD officials and the UK [[William Bach|Minister of Defence Procurement]] said the X-35 consistently outperformed the X-32, although both met or exceeded requirements. 

On [[February 19]], [[2006]], the first F-35 (USAF version) was rolled out in [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]. The aircraft will undergo extensive ground testing and then flight tests in the fall.

===Naming===
On [[July 7]], [[2006]], the US Air Force officially announced the name of the F-35: Lightning II,<ref name="jsf_name_announcement">"[http://www.jsf.mil/downloads/documents/JSF_F-35_2006_Inauguration%20Press%20Release.doc Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter Officially Named 'Lightning II.']" Official Joint Strike Fighter program office press release. [[July 7]], [[2006]].</ref> in honor of Lockheed's [[World War II]]-era twin-prop [[P-38 Lightning]] and the [[Cold War]]-era jet [[English Electric]] [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]]. English Electric's aircraft division was incorporated into [[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]], a predecessor of F-35 partner [[BAE Systems]]. Other names previously listed as contenders were [[Kestrel (bird)|Kestrel]], [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], [[Piasa]], [[Black Mamba]], and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire II]]. Lightning II was also an early name for the aircraft that became the [[F-22 Raptor]].  Lightning II has the advantage of being usable in both countries without modification, as both the US and UK have previous aircraft named "Lightning."

==Design==
[[Image:Harrier.gr7.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[RAF Harrier II|Harrier]], which the F-35 is set to replace.]]
The Lightning II exists in three primary variants: F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C. During the Concept Definition Phase; two JSF airframes were flight tested; the X-35A (which was later converted into the X-35B), and the larger-winged X-35C.[http://www.jsf.mil/history/his_jsf.htm]

The conventional takeoff and landing F-35A is the smallest, lightest version, intended for use primarily by the U.S. Air Force. The F-35C, intended for naval use aboard aircraft carriers, has the largest wingspan, allowing high glide angles and more control at low landing speeds, and the heaviest, most reinforced fuselage to endure arrested landings and catapult launches. The F-35B STOVL aircraft, often referred to as the Marine version, is intended to replace the U.S. Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier strike jets.

The F-35B powerplant uses the highly complex [[Remote Shaft-Driven Lift Fan]] concept. Turbine power is diverted forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox, to a vertically mounted, [[contra-rotating]] lift fan located forward of the main engine in the center of the aircraft. Bypass air from the turbofan exhausts through a pair of roll post nozzles on either side of the fuselage, while the lift fan and the LP turbine streams exhaust through thrust-vectoring nozzles. In effect, the F-35B power plant acts as a flow multiplier. It also reduces environmental effects during landing: for example, limiting heat transfer on a carrier deck.

The STOVL variant of rival [[Boeing X-32]] adopted a Direct Lift System whose engine exhaust gases were redirected to thrust-vectoring nozzles to achieve lift during a STOVL landing. The fan was oversized and throttle-pushed, but still generated insufficient lift. Because of the large engine airflow, the X-32 had a large front air intake, compromising the aesthetics and the aircraft's aerodynamics. Critics said Boeing designed an airplane "only its mother would love", in violation of the [[Maxim (saying)|maxim]] "if it looks good, it flies good".

Both the X-32 and X-35 power plants were derived from Pratt & Whitney's [[Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100|F119]], with the STOVL variant of the latter incorporating a [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls Royce]] Lift Fan module.

Arguably the most persuasive demonstration of the X-35's capability was the final qualifying flight of the JSF trials, in which the X-35B STOVL aircraft took off vertically, went supersonic, and landed vertically.

Elements of the Lockheed X-35 design were pioneered by the F-22. The airframe appears smaller but quite similar to the [[F-22]], which has two engines to the JSF's one.

The JSF was designed to be affordable, lethal, rugged, and easier to maintain. Some specific improvements over current aircraft are:
*Durable, low-maintenance [[Stealth technology]] characteristics
*Integrated avionics and sensor fusion: this allows information from off-board sensors to be combined with those on-board the aircraft, to increase the pilot's situational awareness and improve identification and weapon delivery accuracy, and to relay information quickly to other C2 nodes.
*Low life-cycle costs

The F-35, which will have helmet-mounted displays, will be the first combat aircraft in recent history without a [[Head-Up Display|heads-up-display]].<ref name=NAWCAD>{{cite web | last = Jenkins | first = Jim | year = 2001 | url = http://www.dcmilitary.com/navy/tester/11_02/national_news/39041-1.html | title = Chief test pilot gives brief on F-35 | publisher = dcmilitary.com | accessdate = 2006-04-10}}</ref>

==Analysis of JSF program==
Critics of the program maintain that the JSF suffers from ill-defined design goals; that it has insufficient range to make a capable replacement for dedicated bombing aircraft (but was never intended to do so, nor is it touted as such); that its inability to [[supercruise]] limits it as an air defense platform (although this is not its intended purpose and supercruise was determined to be a low-payoff capability), and that it is almost certain to suffer lengthy development delays and cost overruns (but a thorough requirements definition process with years of analysis and international participation has mitigated this concern). If the F-22 is used as an example, interim types may have to be purchased to fill the gap between the end of useful life of existing fleets and the introduction of the JSF. However, it is important to note that the multi-role design philosophy has been tested and proven in combat over a period of at least 25 years, with successful types like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F-18 Hornet. Several nations, mainly current F-16 and F-18 users, already have sufficient confidence in the design to have committed substantial sums to become minority partners in the JSF manufacturing team.

The program's advocates see the JSF as an opportunity to break out of the decades-old pattern of U.S. military aircraft procurement: instead of a traditional per-service design approach, the JSF is being developed jointly by the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. This allows an estimated 80% [[commonality]] between the JSF variants for the different services, lowering procurement and service costs. This follows to a degree the philosophy behind the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[Panavia Tornado]] international development programs, the latter being called a multi-role combat aircraft (or MRCA) prior to service entry. Additionally, JSF is the first U.S. aircraft program to consider ''cost as independent variable'' (CAIV). In earlier programs the aircraft cost has been a dependent variable; additional features have always increased the aircraft cost. Such design changes are not being allowed during the JSF development.

===Non-vehicle differentiator===
A ground-based information system (the Autonomic Logistic Information System, or ALIS), built by Lockheed Martin Simulation Training and Support, is intended to make the JSF less expensive to operate and maintain.

===Cost to weight ratio===
Through 2004 the JSF's total projected cost had risen 23% to US$244 billion. The major technical problem was the F-35B variant's mass, which was reported to be one [[tonne]] (2,200 [[pound (mass)|pound]]s) or 8%, over the target, which meant that the STOVL plane was projected to miss performance requirements.

Lockheed Martin eventually solved the weight problem by adding engine thrust and shedding over a ton by thinning the aircraft's skin; shrinking the F-35B weapons bay and vertical tails; redesigning the wing-mate joint, portions of the electrical system, and the portion of the aircraft immediately behind the cockpit; and rerouting some thrust from the roll-post outlets to the main nozzle. <ref>Fulghum, David A.;  Wall, Robert ([[19 September]] [[2004]]). [http://www.aviationnow.com/avnow/news/channel_awst_story.jsp?id=news/09204wna.xml USAF Plans for Fighters Change]. ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'' Retrieved Feb. 08, 2006.</ref>

The smaller weapons bay will limit F-35B to 2 x 1000 lb (450 kg) weapons internally (this is as originally planned, for the 2 x 2000 lb requirement was added later). This is not expected to be a hindrance in [[close air support]] missions, which are likely to take place after enemy air defenses are down. Still, this may make the "B" variant different from the other two, boosting costs.

The internal weapons are stored offline to the external air flow, which will complicate weapons certification testing &mdash; no demonstrations of weapons delivery capability were done prior to contract award.

===Postulated USAF STOVL purchase===
The JSF program is not immune from [[interservice rivalry|interservice politics]]. A recurring "posturing" theme has been the potential for a USAF requirement for the F-35B. The STOVL variant had been viewed as the most likely victim of cost-cutting measures; however, a USAF "commitment" seems to guarantee the aircraft that the USMC, RN, and RAF need. It is understood that the U.S. military's experience in [[Afghanistan]] has highlighted the importance of flexible assets in the [[close air support]] role.

The USAF has reportedly investigated buying up to three [[United_States_Air_Force#Wings|wings]] (representing 216 examples) of the F-35B. For a time it appeared that the hypothetical USAF variant of the F-35B would contain enough changes to constitute a new variant (an F-35D). Changes considered were to include differences in the propulsion system to increase emphasis on [[STOL]] capability over that of [[VTOL]], a larger wing to allow more fuel, an interior cannon (as opposed to the USMC external gun pod), or changes to the in-flight refueling system (sacrificing compatibility with Air Force [[KC-135 Stratotanker]]s, which only use the flying boom in-flight refueling system, but not the [[KC-10 Extender]]). However, due to opposition from people involved with the program, and the associated cost of developing a fourth variant, the hypothetical USAF version would likely be identical to the USMC/RN F-35B specification.
