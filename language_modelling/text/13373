'''"Night Out"''' is the eleventh episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[United States|American]] [[comedy]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]'', and the show's sixty-third episode overall. Written by [[Mindy Kaling]], and directed by [[Ken Whittingham]], the episode first aired in the [[United States]] on [[April 24]], [[2008]] on the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC).<ref name="NBC"/>

In this episode, Michael and Dwight travel to New York City to party with Ryan. Ryan starts acting erratically, and it is revealed that he is under the influence of drugs. Meanwhile, the rest of the office is forced to come in and work on a Saturday. Jim proposes that they work late on Friday, so they don't have to come in the next day. Once the office finishes working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly blames Jim.

==Plot==
A surprisingly friendly [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B.J. Novak]]) arrives to the Scranton Branch to explain the new [[Dunder Mifflin]] website, "Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0". The previous version was shut down due to an invasion by sexual predators of the social networking component of the site. As Ryan leaves, he tells [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) of the women he meets in clubs in [[New York City]]. Michael and [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) decide to go to New York, find Ryan, party with him, and try to meet girls.

Upon their arrival at a club, they find Ryan, apparently under the influence of drugs, although Michael and Dwight don't appear to notice. Later on, Michael, Dwight, Ryan, and Ryan's colleague, Troy Undercook (Noel Potek), wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they don't have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them off with members of a women's basketball team, also waiting in line. When Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and violent, he accidentally hits a girl and is attacked by her friends. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, and the trio run off with Ryan. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks "his friend Troy" has a [[drug addiction|drug problem]], and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a [[wiretap]] and snitching on a [[drug dealer]].

Back in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]], the rest of the office is forced to work on a Saturday to record their own sales as the website's sales, which is, according to Ryan, "a temporary procedure to increase the legitimacy of the website". With no one eager to participate, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) decides to ask everyone to stay in the office overtime instead of coming in for the Saturday. They all agree with the plan, and after working until 9:00 in the late evening, they are shocked to find the parking lot gates locked, directly resulted from Jim forgetting to tell the security guard that they were staying overtime. They are unable to return to the office because [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) locked the door from the inside, and Dwight, miles away in New York, has both the spare and master keys. Sitting in the lobby area waiting for the security guard to arrive, the employees exchange jokes and during a moment of levity, [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) affectionately places his hand on Pam's knee. After an excruciatingly awkward silence, Toby proclaims that he is moving to [[Costa Rica]]; he then hops the parking lot fence and runs away. Jim repeatedly calls Hank, the security guard (Hugh Dane), but he fails to show up. Eventually, the cleaning staff arrives and lets everyone out.

==Production==
"Night Out" was the seventh episode of the series directed by [[Ken Whittingham]]. Whittingham had previously directed "[[Health Care (The Office)|Health Care]]", "[[Michael's Birthday]]", "[[The Convention]]", "[[The Merger]]", "[[Phyllis' Wedding]]", and "[[Launch Party]]". "Night Out" was written by [[Mindy Kaling]], who also acts in the show as customer service representative [[Kelly Kapoor]].  The episode was shot during the night. The scene that has Toby putting his hand on Pam's knee was shot at 2:30 on a Friday night. That scene was shot about eight times because according to writer and actor Mindy Kaling, "everyone kept breaking because Toby was so vulnerable and awkward." [[Kate Flannery]] did her stunts in the scene where Pam throws a football and hits [[Meredith Palmer]] (Flannery) in the face. Flannery had a stunt double on the set, but she was never needed for the scene. Kate recalls that she "didn't get a scratch in all 14 takes that we shot." [[Paul Lieberstein]] on the other hand used a stunt double for the scene in which Toby climbs over the fence. Although Lieberstein offered to do the stunt himself, producer [[Greg Daniels]] decided against it.<ref name="OfficeTally">{{cite web |url=http://www.officetally.com/mindy-kaling-answers-night-out-questions |title=Mindy Kaling answers <U+2018>Night Out<U+2019> questions |accessdate=2008-07-05 |work= |publisher=OfficeTally |date=2008-04-26 }}</ref>

When casting "Tall Girl #1" (the woman who would kiss with Dwight), the show was looking for a girl <nowiki>6'1''</nowiki> or taller. Actress Cassie Fliegel, who is <nowiki>5'11''</nowiki> auditioned for the part anyway, and after getting a callback went to a gym to workout. On the day of the callbacks, Fliegel remembers being right next to a girl who was <nowiki>6'8''</nowiki>. Despite her size, Cassie, a former basketball player herself, was cast for the part. Initially, she didn't even know that her character was going to make-out with Dwight. Fliegel recalls that when she first heard about kissing Dwight she "was like, I don<U+2019>t think so,". However, after finding out that she had her own trailer, Fliegel warmed up to the idea.<ref name="RemoteAccess">{{cite web |url=http://remote.lohudblogs.com/2008/04/24/office-kiss-and-tell-actress-who-plants-one-on-dwight-tonight-grateful-for-big-break/ |title=Office kiss and tell: Actress who plants one on Dwight tonight grateful for big break |accessdate=2008-07-05 |work= |publisher=Remote Access |date=2008-04-24 }}</ref> On the day of shooting, Fliegel said that [[Rainn Wilson]] was "hilarious." The two were sitting next to each other right before the scene was going to be filmed, and Rainn turned to Cassie and said "Ok. So...This is how this is gonna go. Mostly lip-a little tongue-but mostly lips." The two did six or seven takes, each ending after the camera panned over [[Steve Carell]]. According to Fliegel, Rainn Wilson kept telling director [[Ken Whittingham]] "I think we need another take of that!"<ref name="ScrantonBranchOffice">{{cite web |url=http://twocentsbranchoffice.blogspot.com/2008/04/scrantonbranchoffice-exclusive.html?showComment=1209161820000#c7705343324240049314 |title=ScrantonBranchOffice Exclusive Interview with Dwight's "Night Out" Date!  |accessdate=2008-07-05 |work= |publisher=ScrantonBranchOffice |date=2008-04-25 }}</ref>

The music in the club was chosen by [[writer]] and [[actor]] [[B.J. Novak]], Mindy Kaling's boyfriend [[Benjamin Nugent]], and [[Daniel Chun]]. For the shooting of Ryan dancing in the club, the girl that Ryan hit was actually a stunt woman. Pads had been placed on the floor so B.J. Novak could fall down safely. The [[Germany|German]] [[lullaby]] that Dwight sang to Ryan was script supervisor Veda Semarne's idea. Her [[Austria|Austrian]] grandmother would sing the same song to her as a child.<ref name="OfficeTally"/>
