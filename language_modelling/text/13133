The '''Palatine uprising''' ({{lang-de|Pf<U+00E4>lzische Aufstand}} or ''Pf<U+00E4>lzer Aufstand''), took place during the months of May and June 1849 in [[Circle of Rhine|Rhenish Palatinate]] and was part of the Imperial Constitution Campaign (''Reichsverfassungskampagne''). The aim of the revolutionaries was both the defence of the [[Frankfurt Constitution|Constitution]] as well as liberation from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]].

== Background ==
The movement of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] in the member states of the [[German Confederation]] had led to the election of the [[Frankfurt Assembly]], the first all-German parliament. This parliament had enacted a [[Frankfurt Constitution|Constitution of the German Empire]] on 28 March 1849 that envisaged the state to be a hereditary constitutional monarchy. The Prussian king [[Frederick William IV]], however, refused to accept the imperial crown offered to him.

In the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] - to which the [[Rhine Circle|Rhenish Palatinate]] belonged - the first parliamentary elections to take place after the recently imposed voting rights were held on 7 December 1848. The result was a majority in favour of the Left (''die Linke''), the so-called "Followers of Popular Sovereignty and the Unity of Germany". In particular, in the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate voters had filled all 19 seats with representatives of the Left.<ref>[http://www.hdbg.de/parlament/content/ltDetail.php?id=13&popH=840 see home page of the House of Bavarian History]</ref> 
At the opening of parliament on 22 January 1849, King [[Maximilian II Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian]] promised further reforms. On 9 January, the majority of the parliament brought the bill of rights<ref>''Act on the Fundamental Rights of the German People'' of 21 December 1848 [http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/1848/content/titleinfo/2166565 online at the University Library of Frankfurt am Main]</ref> laid out by the Frankfurt Assembly in December 1848 into force as an act. The king refused to recognize the decision and adjourned the parliament on 8 March. On 23 April, the king and his government rejected the Frankfurt Constitution and, on 14 April, the Bavarian Supreme Court rejected the validity of the Fundamental Rights document for Bavaria.<ref>see Fleischmann p. 106</ref>

This was regarded by the Left as a [[coup d'etat]]. Palatine deputies to the National Assembly laid a resolution before the Palatine municipalities, according to which the non-recognition of the constitution was asserted to be ''"a criminal rebellion against the newly created legal order; and any use of force [would be] treason against the German Nation"''.<ref>quoted by G. Struve, p. 241</ref> The [[Central March Societies|March societies]] in the Bavarian territories of the Palatinate, Franconia and Swabia now demanded the adoption of the constitution, the abolition of the monarchy and the separation of the Palatinate and Franconia from the Kingdom of Bavaria.<ref>[http://www.hdbg.eu/koenigreich/web/index.php/themen/index/herrscher_id/3/id/28 see home page of the House of Bavarian History]</ref>

On 3 May 1849, the [[May Uprising in Dresden]] broke out, but was put down on 9 May by Saxon and Prussian troops. On 11 May, the [[Baden Revolution|third Baden uprising]] began with the mutiny of Baden troops in the federal fortress of [[Rastatt Fortress|Rastatt]].

== Course of the uprising ==
=== Palatinate committee for the defence of the constitution ===
On 1 May 1849, a meeting of the democratic people's associations was held in [[Kaiserslautern]]. About 12,000 people gathered under the slogan "If the government becomes rebellious, the citizens of the Palatinate will become the enforcers of the laws." On 2 May, it was decided that a ten-man "State Committee for the Defence and Implementation of the [[Frankfurt Constitution|Constitution]]" should be established. There was no declaration of a republic, as had happened in Baden, however. Within a short time the committee took over the province. As a result, people's militias were formed and officials had to swear an oath to the constitution. A revolutionary army was formed; and even soldiers of the [[Royal Bavarian Army]] joined.<ref>M<U+00FC>ller, Frank Lorenz: ''The Revolution of 1848-49.'' Darmstadt, 2002, p. 137;. Staroste, Volume 2, p. 261 estimates the number of deserters from the Bavarian Army as 3,500</ref>
On 7 May 1849 the representative of the central authority for the Palatinate, [[Bernhard Eisenstuck]], legitimized the defence committee, for which he was dismissed on 11 May for exceeding his powers.

=== Provisional government ===
On 17 May 1849, a people's assembly in Kaiserslautern decided to establish a five-man provisional government under the leadership of lawyer, [[Joseph Martin Reichard]]. Also elected to the government were Philip Hepp, Friedrich Sch<U+00FC>ler (absent; later declined to stand), August Ferdinand Culmann (absent; later declined to stand), Georg Friedrich Kolb (absent; later declined to stand). In place of the absentees, Peter Fries, Jean Louis Christian Greiner and Nicholas  Schmitt were selected.

This government voted in favour of the [[Frankfurt Constitution|constitution]] and prepared for its final separation from Bavaria. Thus there was, if only for a few weeks, a ''de facto'' separation of Rhenish Palatinate from Bavarian rule. On 18 May 1849 an alliance with the [[Baden Republic]] was agreed.

=== Revolutionary army ===

The commander of the revolutionary units was transferred on 9 May 1849 to [[Daniel Fenner von Fenneberg]]; however he relinquished this position on 20 May again. On that day a military commission was introduced whose chairmanship was held by [[Fritz Anneke]]. On 21 May, military command was given to [[Franz Sznayde]]. [[Ludwig Blenker]] was commander of the people's militia and [[August Willich]] was commander of all Palatine volunteers. [[Franz Zitz]] and [[Ludwig Bamberger]] commanded a Rhenish-Hessian ''[[freikorps]]''.

=== Defeat ===
[[File:Die Gartenlaube (1872) b 609.jpg|thumb|upright|Freischar memorial in Kirchheimbolanden]]
On 11 June the feared Prussian intervention began. The [[advance guard]] of the 1st Division of the 1st Prussian Army Corps under Major General von Hannecken crossed the Palatine border near [[Bad Kreuznach|Kreuznach]] unopposed.

At [[Battle of Kirchheimbolanden|Kirchheimbolanden]] there was a battle on 14 June with men of the people's militia led by Mathilde Hitzfeld, but in the end they were all killed or captured.

Agains the army of 19,000 [[Prussian Army|Prussian soldiers]] under [[Moritz von Hirschfeld]], the revolutionary troops, who were also poorly armed, were hopelessly inferior. They put up hardly any resistance. In addition it was clear that the Palatine uprising, which became increasingly radical, not longer had broad support amongst the rural population. On 14 June 1849 the provisional government fled and the Bavarian authorities returned to their positions. With the [[Battle of Ludwigshafen]] on 15 June and the [[Battle of Rinnthal]] on 17 June 1849, fighting on Palatine soil was practically over, and the remains of the Palatine revolutionary army retreated on 18 June over the [[Knielingen]] Rhine bridge towards Baden - followed by its rearguard, the Willich Freikorps, on 19 June.

As a result of the [[Uprising|rebellion]] and [[high treason]] 333 legal cases were pursued.<ref>M<U+00FC>ller, Frank Lorenz: ''Die Revolution von 1848/49.'' Darmstadt, 2002, p. 138</ref> Two [[death sentence]]s were passed against revolutionary Bavarian officers. On 9 March 1850 in [[Landau in der Pfalz]], [[Fugger von der Lilie#Theodor Fugger|Lieutenant Graf Fugger]] was executed; but  Major Fach was able to escape.<ref>[[Wilhelm Blos]]: ''Die Deutsche Revolution.
