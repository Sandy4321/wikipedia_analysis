'''Isaac Okoronkwo''' (born May 1, 1978 in [[Nbene]], [[Nigeria]]) is a professional [[football (soccer)|football]] player who currently plays as a defender for [[FC Rostov]] in Russia.

Okoronkwo started his career at [[FC Lagos]] before moving to the Nigerian topclub [[Julius Berger FC]]. His first club outside Nigeria was a six month spell at [[Al-Rayyan Sports Club|Al-Rayyan]] in Qatar, but the club could not afford to keep him before this period and he returned home to [[Iwuanyanwu Nationale]]. He spent one season there before again heading abroad with [[Sheriff Tiraspol]] of Moldova for two seasons. In Summer 2000, he signed to [[Shakhtar Donetsk]] in the Ukraine.

With Shakhtar he played in the [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Cup]], and won the Ukrainian Cup in 2001 and the league title in 2002. After his contract expired in 2003, several [[FA Premier League]] and German [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] clubs like [[Schalke 04]] and [[Borussia M<U+00F6>nchengladbach]] tried to sign him. He eventually signed a one-year deal with newly-promoted Premier League side [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]].

Okoronkwo's time in England did not prove a success though as he was unable to break into the team until the closing months of the season, by which time the club faced almost certain relegation from the top flight. After they suffered the drop, Okoronkwo was released and eventually came to play in Russia with [[Alania Vladikavkaz]]. Alania folded under financial problems in 2005 and he signed with [[FC Moscow]] in 2006, soon becoming an important member of the starting line-up at his new club. The same season he was voted player of the season, alongside [[Hector Bracamonte]]. 

Okoronkwo played 25 games for the [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria national team]] since making his debut on January 13, 2001, against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]]. He played in the [[2002 African Cup of Nations|2002]] and [[2004 African Cup of Nations|2004]] [[African Cup of Nations]] (finishing 3rd both times) and in the [[Football at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Olympics Games]] in 2000. He also played in every minute of Nigeria's [[2002 FIFA World Cup#Group F|2002 World Cup]] campaign, where they failed to progress beyond the group stage.
