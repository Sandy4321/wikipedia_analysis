'''Gheorghe I. T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu''' (also known as ''Gu<U+0163><U+0103> T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu'', with a slightly antiquated pet form of his given name; [[1886]]&mdash;[[March 28]], [[1957]]) was a [[Romania]]n politician who served twice as [[Prime Minister of Romania]] (1934-1937; 1939-1940), three times as [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] (''interim'' in 1934 and 1938; appointed to the office in 1945-1947), and once as [[Ministry of National Defence of Romania|Minister of War]] (1934). Representing the "young liberals" faction inside the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu began his political career as a collaborator of [[Ion G. Duca]], becoming noted for his [[anti-Communism]] and, in time, for his conflicts with the PNL's leader [[Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu]] and the Foreign Minister [[Nicolae Titulescu]]. During his first time in office, he moved closer to [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], leading an ambivalent policy toward the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] and ultimately becoming instrumental in establishing the [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[Corporatism|corporatist]] regime around the [[National Renaissance Front]]. In 1940, he accepted the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] to the [[Soviet Union]], and consequently had to resign.

After the start of [[World War II]], Gheorghe T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu initiated a move to rally political forces in opposition to [[Ion Antonescu]]'s dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the [[National Liberal Party-T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu]], and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed [[Petru Groza]] cabinet. In 1946-1947, he was also the President of the Romanian Delegation to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Peace Conference]] in [[Paris]]. After that moment, relations between T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the [[T<U+0103>m<U+0103>d<U+0103>u Affair]]. Following the [[Communist Romania|Communist takeover]], he was arrested and held as a [[political prisoner]], while being called to testify in the trial of [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]]. He died soon after his release from prison.

Elected an honorary member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1937, he was removed from his seat by the Communist authorities in 1948.<ref>Gogan</ref> One of his brothers, Colonel [[<U+015E>tefan T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu]], was at some point the leader of a minor [[Nazism|Nazi]] grouping, the [[National Socialist Party (Romania)|National Socialist Party]].

==Early life and politics==
Born in [[T<U+00E2>rgu Jiu]], T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu studied at [[Carol I High School]] in [[Craiova]]. He later went to [[France]], where he was awarded a [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Paris]] in 1912, with a thesis on the Romanian [[parliamentary system]] (''Le r<U+00E9>gime <U+00E9>lectoral et parlementaire en Roumanie'').<ref>Gogan</ref> He subsequently worked as a [[lawyer]] in [[Bucharest]]. He fathered a son, Tudor, and a daughter, Sanda (married to the lawyer Ulise Negropontes in 1940).<ref>Petru</ref>

After joining the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]] (PNL), he was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]] for the first time in November 1919, representing [[Gorj County]].<ref>Constantinescu, p.21</ref> Among his first notable actions as a politician was an initiative to interpellate [[Nicolae L. Lupu]], the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of Interior Affairs Ministry]] in the [[Romanian National Party]]-[[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]] cabinet, in answer to concerns that the executive was tolerating [[Socialism|socialist]] agitation in the countryside.<ref>Constantinescu, p.24-25</ref>

He stood among the PNL's "young liberals" faction (as they were colloquially known), supporting [[free trade]] and a more [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rule over the country around [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], and opposing both the older generation of leaders (who tended to advocate [[protectionism]] and a [[liberal democracy]]) and the dissident group of [[Gheorghe I. Br<U+0103>tianu]] (''see [[National Liberal Party-Br<U+0103>tianu]]'').<ref>Hitchins, p.380, 385, 412; Ornea, p.16; Scurtu, "Politica...", p.16-17; Veiga, p.212</ref>

Undersecretary in the Interior Affairs Ministry under several PNL cabinets (beginning with that of [[Ion I. C. Br<U+0103>tianu]] in 1922-1926), he first became noted as a collaborator of [[Ion G. Duca]]. In 1924-1936, in contrast to his post-[[World War II]] agenda, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu was a noted [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]], and reacted vehemently against the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCdR, later PCR)<ref>Cioroianu, p.36, 111</ref> &mdash; recommending and obtaining its outlawing, based on Communist adversity to the concept of [[Greater Romania]], and notably arguing that the [[Comintern]]-supported [[Tatarbunary Uprising]] was evidence of "[[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[communism]]".<ref>T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu, 1926 speech</ref>

==First cabinet==
===Context===
T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu became leader of the cabinet in January 1934, as the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Iron Guard]] had assassinated Prime Minister Duca on [[December 30]], [[1933]] (the five-day premiership of [[Constantin Anghelescu]] ensured transition between the two governments). His was the second PNL cabinet formed during Carol's reign, and the latter's failure to draw support from the mainstream group led to a tight connection being established between Carol and the young liberals, with T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu backing the process leading to the creation of a royal [[dictatorship]].<ref>Hitchins, p.412; Scurtu, "Politica...", p.16</ref> One of T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's first measures was a decisive move to end the conflict between the National Liberal executive and the [[List of mayors of Bucharest|Mayor of Bucharest]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]] (who was backed by the [[National Peasants' Party]]) &mdash; making use of his prerogative, he removed Dobrescu from office on January 18.<ref>Z<U+0103>nescu ''et al.'', p.83</ref>

The brief period constituted a reference point in [[Economy of Romania|Romanian economy]], as the emergence from the [[Great Depression]], although marked by endemic problems, saw prosperity more widespread than ever before.<ref>Veiga, p.211</ref> This was, in part, the contribution of new economic relations which T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu defended and encouraged: the state transformed itself into the main agent of economic activities, allowing for prosperous businesses to benefit from its demands, and, in time, leading to the creation of a ''[[Camarilla (history)|camarilla]]'' dominated by the figures of industrialists such as [[Aristide Blank]], [[Nicolae Malaxa]], and [[Max Auschnitt]].<ref>Gallagher, p.102-103; Veiga, p.212-213</ref> In this context, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's allegedly subservient position in front of Carol was a frequent topic of ridicule at the time.<ref>Gallagher, p.102; Pandrea</ref> According to a hostile account of the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Petre Pandrea]]:
<blockquote>"T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu was ceremonious in order to cover his menial nature. When he was leaving audiences [with the King], he pressed forward on the small of his back and  returned ''facing backwards'' from the desk to the door, not daring to show his back. [...] Watching over the scene [...], Carol II exclaimed to his intimate assistants: <br>&mdash; I don't have a big enough tooshie for all the politicians to kiss!"<ref>Pandrea (Pandrea's italics)</ref></blockquote>

Among other services rendered, he intervened in the conflict between Carol and his brother, [[Nicholas of Romania|Prince Nicholas]], asking the latter to renounce either his marriage to Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti &mdash; considered a misalliance by Carol, it had not been recognized by Romanian authorities &mdash; or his princely prerogatives.<ref>Scurtu, "Principele Nicolae..."</ref> Nicholas chose the latter alternative in 1937.<ref>Scurtu, "Principele Nicolae..."</ref>

Inside his party, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu lost ground to [[Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu]], elected by the traditional Liberal elite as a compromise in order to ensure unity; upon his election in 1934, the latter stated:
<blockquote>"This time as well, I would have gladly conceded, if I were to believe that anyone else in the party could gather voter unanimity."<ref>Br<U+0103>tianu, in Scurtu, "Politica...", p.17</ref></blockquote>

The issue remained debated for the following two years. The party congress of July 1936 eventually elected T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu to the second position in the party, that of general secretary.<ref>Scurtu, "Politica...", p.17</ref>

===European politics===
In his foreign policy, Prime Minister T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu balanced two different priorities, attempting to strengthen the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance|traditional military alliance]] with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] which was aimed at the [[Soviet Union]], and reacting against the growing regional influence of [[Nazi Germany]] by maintaining the relevancy of the [[Little Entente]] and establishing further contacts with the Soviets. 

In August 1936, he renounced the services of [[Nicolae Titulescu]] as Foreign Minister, replacing him with [[Victor Antonescu]]. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's [[diplomatic corps]] voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including [[Constantin Vi<U+015F>oianu]], the ambassador to Poland, [[Constantin Antoniade]], Romania's representative to the [[League of Nations]], [[Dimitrie Ghyka]], the ambassador to [[Belgium]], and [[Caius Brediceanu]], the ambassador to [[Austria]]) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as [[Antoine Bibesco]], were returned to office.<ref>Potra, Part I, Part II</ref> Bibesco subsequently campaigned in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], in an attempt to reassure Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities.<ref>Potra, Part II</ref> T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.<ref><U+0162>urlea, p.29</ref>

In early 1937, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu rejected the proposal of [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]], [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland|Poland's Minister of Foreign Affairs]], to withdraw Romania's support for [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and attempt a reconciliation with [[Hungary]] (the following year, Romania withdrew its support for the former, indicating, just before the [[Munich Agreement]], that it was not in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia's frontiers).<ref>Hitchins, p.432-433</ref> This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal erupted in the same year, when the country's ambassador to Romania, [[Jan <U+0160>eba]], published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over [[Bessarabia]]) and expressing the hope that the Soviet state would extend its borders into Western [[Belarus|Byelorussia]] and [[Ukraine]].<ref>Otu</ref> [[Kamil Krofta]], Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu paid a visit to [[List of Prime Ministers of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Prime Minister]] [[Milan Hod<U+017E>a]], <U+0160>eba was recalled to [[Prague]].<ref>Otu</ref>

===Facing the Iron Guard===
In combating the Iron Guard, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu chose to relax virtually all pressures on the latter (while mimicking some of its messages), and instead concentrated again on curbing the activities of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) and outlawing its ''[[Popular Front]]''-type organizations (''see [[Amicii URSS]]'').<ref>Cioroianu, p.43, 113-118; Frunz<U+0103>, p.84, 102-103; Veiga, p.223-224</ref> 

In April 1936, he and the [[List of Romanian Ministers of the Interior|Minister of the Interior]] [[Ion Incule<U+0163>]] allowed the a youth congress to gather in [[T<U+00E2>rgu Mure<U+015F>]], aware of the fact that it was masking a fascist gathering; delegates to the congress, traveling in a special train commissioned by the government, vandalized [[Ion Duca]]'s memorial plate in [[Sinaia train station]], and, upon their arrival in T<U+00E2>rgu Mure<U+015F>, made public their violent [[Anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] agenda.<ref>Ornea, p.304-305; Veiga, p.233</ref> It was probably there that [[death squad]]s were designated and assigned missions, leading to the murder of [[Mihai Stelescu]], a former associate, in June of the next year.<ref>Ornea, p.305, 307</ref>

In February 1937, an intense publicity campaign by the Guard, begun with the ostentatious funerals of [[Ion Mo<U+0163>a]] and [[Vasile Marin]] (killed in the [[Spanish Civil War]]) and culminating in the physical assaulting of [[Traian Bratu]], [[rector]] of the [[University of Ia<U+015F>i]], by Guardist students, provoked the premier's order to close down universities throughout the country.<ref>Veiga, p.234</ref> 

Later in that year, the collaboration between monarch and premier, coupled with the fact that T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu had successfully attracted [[Nationalism|nationalist]] votes from the Iron Guard, led to the signing of an electoral agreement between the latter, the [[National Peasants' Party]] (the main democratic opposition group), and the [[National Liberal Party-Br<U+0103>tianu]] &mdash; the pact was meant to prevent all attempt by Carol to manipulate the votes in elections.<ref>Hitchins, p.412-413; Ornea, p.302-303, 304; Veiga, p.234-235; Zamfirescu, p.11</ref> (A secondary and unexpected development was that the illegal PCR, which had decided to back the National Peasants' Party prior to the elections, eventually supported the electoral pact.)<ref>Veiga, p.235</ref> T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's own alliance policy rose the anger of his opponents inside the PNL, as he signed collaboration agreements with the fascist [[Romanian Front]] and [[German Party (Romania)|German Party]].<ref>Scurtu, "Politica...", p.17</ref> 

The [[Romanian general election, 1937|1937 elections]] led to an unprecedented situation: although the PNL and T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu had gained the largest percentage of the vote (almost 36%), they fell short of being awarded [[majority bonus]] (granted at 40% of the vote).<ref>Hitchins, p.413</ref> As the [[far right]] had gathered momentum (the Guard, running under the name of "Everything for the Fatherland Party", had obtained 15.6 of the vote),<ref>Hitchins, p.413; Zamfirescu, p.11</ref> Carol was faced with the threat of an Iron Guard government, which would have been one deeply opposed to all of his political principles: he called on a third party, [[Octavian Goga]]'s [[National Christian Party]] (coming from the anti-Semitic far right but deeply opposed to the Guard) to form a new cabinet in December of that year.<ref>Hitchins, p.414</ref> 

Consequently, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu renounced his offices inside the party, and, while keeping his office of general secretary, he was surpassed by the readmitted [[Gheorghe I. Br<U+0103>tianu]] &mdash; who was elected to the new office of PNL vice president on [[January 10]], [[1938]].<ref>Scurtu, "Politica...", p.17</ref> After the failure of Goga's policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu, resorted to dissolving all political parties on [[May 30]], [[1938]], creating instead the [[National Renaissance Front]].<ref>Hitchins, p.415, 417-418; Pope Brewer</ref>

==Second cabinet==
{{main|National Renaissance Front}}
In this context, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu chose to back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, remained active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning it had never been enforced any further).<ref>Hitchins, p.416; Veiga, p.247-248</ref> Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years.<ref>Scurtu, "Politica...", p.18</ref> Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by [[Iuliu Maniu]], leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu's political allies.<ref>Scurtu, "Politica...", p.18</ref>

Soon after his second arrival to power, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu became noted for the enthusiastic support he gave to the [[Modern art|modernist]] sculptor [[Constantin Brancusi]], and directed state funds to finance the building of Brancusi's ''[[The Endless Column]]'' complex in [[T<U+00E2>rgu Jiu]] (completed in October 1938).<ref>Gogan</ref> 

Alongside [[Alexandru Vaida-Voevod]] and [[Constantin Argetoianu]] (whom he succeeded as Premier), T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu became a dominant figure in the group of maverick pro-Carol politicians.<ref>Argetoianu</ref> After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite political forces in a [[national government]] that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1945, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu stressed his belief that [[authoritarianism]] benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war.<ref>Pope Brewer</ref> T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties,<ref>Hitchins, p.418</ref> and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by [[Ernest Urd<U+0103>reanu]] and [[Mihail Ghelmegeanu]], began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.<ref>Hitchins, p.419; Ornea, p.323-325; Zamfirescu, p.11</ref> 

T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu remained in office throughout the rest of the [[Phony War]], until the [[fall of France]], and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with [[Nazi Germany]] (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country)<ref>Veiga, p.267</ref> and saw the crumbling of Romania's alliance with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]].<ref>Veiga, p.267-268</ref> The cabinet was brought down by the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia|cession of Bessarabia]] and [[Bukovina|Northern Bukovina]] to the Soviet Union (effects of the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu with [[Ion Gigurtu]], and recreating the Front as the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] ''Party of the Nation''.<ref>Argetoianu; Hitchins, p.419</ref>

==World War==
[[Image:Northern_Transylvania_yellow.png|thumb|250px|[[Greater Romania]] with [[Northern Transylvania]] highlighted in yellow]]
After the [[Second Vienna Award]] (when [[Northern Transylvania]] was lost to Hungary), confirming Carol's failure to preserve both the country's neutrality and its territorial integrity, Romania was taken over by an Iron Guard dictatorial government (the [[National Legionary State]]). Speaking five years later, [[Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu]] placed the blame for the serious developments on T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's own actions, addressing him directly:
<blockquote>"I remind you: [...] you have contributed directly, in 1940, in steering the country towards a foreign policy that, as one could tell even then, was to prove ill-fated and which led us to the loathsome Vienna settlement, one which you have supported inside the [[Crown Council]] [...]."<ref>Br<U+0103>tianu, in <U+0162>urlea, p.29</ref></blockquote>  

On [[November 26]], [[1940]], the Iron Guard began a bloody retaliation against various political figures who had served under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu and [[Constantin Argetoianu]] were among the second wave of captured politicians (on November 27), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of [[Romanian Police|regular police]] forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist [[militia]]s.<ref>Veiga, p.292, 309</ref>

Retired from political life during the war, he was initially sympathetic to [[Ion Antonescu]]'s pro-German dictatorship (''see [[Romania during World War II]]'') &mdash; Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu, who remained in opposition to the Antonescu regime, made mention an official visit to Bessarabia, recovered after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], when T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu had accompanied Antonescu, "thus making common cause with his warmongering action".<ref>Br<U+0103>tianu, in <U+0162>urlea, p.29</ref> At the time, his daughter Sandra T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu Negropontes worked as an [[ambulance]] driver for the [[Romanian Red Cross]].<ref>Petru</ref>

In the end, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu became involved in negotiations aimed at withdrawing Romania from the conflict, and, while beginning talks with the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR), tried to build foreign connections to support Romania's cause following the inevitable defeat; he thus corresponded with [[Edvard Bene<U+0161>]], leader of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[government in exile]] in [[England]].<ref>Tejchman</ref> Bene<U+0161>, who had already been discussing matters involving Romania with [[Richard Franasovici]] and [[Grigore Gafencu]], and had agreed to support the Romanian cause, informed the [[Allies of World War II|Allied governments]] of T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's designs.<ref>Tejchman</ref> 

T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu later contrasted his diplomatic approach with the strategy of [[Barbu <U+015E>tirbey]] (who had only attempted an agreement with the [[Western Allies]] in [[Cairo]], instead of opening relations with the Soviets).<ref>Pope Brewer</ref> Initially meeting with the refusal of [[Iuliu Maniu]] and Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu (who decided to invest their trust in <U+015E>tirbey), he was relatively successful after the Cairo initiative proved fruitless: the two traditional parties accepted collaboration with the bloc formed by the PCR, the [[Romanian Social Democratic Party (defunct)|Romanian Social Democratic Party]], the [[Ploughmen's Front]], and the [[Socialist Peasants' Party]], leading to the formation of the short-lived and unstable ''National Democratic Bloc'' (BND) in June 1944.<ref>Tejchman</ref> It overthrew Antonescu in August, by means of the successful [[King Michael Coup]].

==Alliance with the Communists==
T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu returned to the PNL later in 1944 &mdash; after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had entered Romania and the country had become an Allied state, political parties were again allowed to register. Nevertheless, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu was again opposed to the party leaders Dinu and [[Gheorghe I. Br<U+0103>tianu]], and split to form his own group in June-July 1945.<ref>Hitchins, p.502; <U+0162>urlea, p.29</ref> Dinu Br<U+0103>tianu convened the PNL leadership and formally excluded T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu and his partisans, citing their support for dictatorial regimes.<ref><U+0162>urlea, p.29</ref>

As the PCR, which was growing more influent (with the backing of [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation]]) while generally lacking popular appeal, sought to form alliances with various forces in order to increase its backing, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu declared his group to be [[left-wing]] and [[Social liberalism|Social liberal]], while attempting to preserve a middle course in the new political setting, by pleading for close relations to be maintained with both the Soviet Union and the Western Allies.<ref>Hitchins, p.502, 506; <U+0162>urlea, p.30, 31</ref> [[N. D. Cocea]], a prominent socialist who had joined the PNL, represented the faction in talks for an alliance with the Communists.<ref>Frunz<U+0103>, p.147</ref> The agreement, favored by [[Ana Pauker]], was vehemently opposed by another member of the Communist leadership, [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]], who argued in favor of "making a distinction inside the [[bourgeoisie]]",<ref>P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu, in Betea,</ref> and collaborating with the main PNL, while calling T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's faction "a gang of [[Confidence trick|con artists]], [[blackmail]]ers, and well-known [[bribe]]rs".<ref>P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu, in Betea</ref>

T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu became Foreign Minister and vice president of the government in the cabinet of [[Petru Groza]] when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries &mdash; Finance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was [[Alexandru Alexandrini]]), Public Works, with [[Gheorghe V<U+00E2>ntu]],<ref>Cioroianu, p.97; Frunz<U+0103>, p.187, 308</ref> Industry (with [[Petre N. Bejan]]), and Religious Affairs, with [[Radu Ro<U+015F>cule<U+0163>]]. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an [[electoral fraud]] during the [[Romanian general election, 1946|general election in 1946]] by failing to reply to [[United States|American]] proposals for organizing fair elections.<ref>Hitchins, p.517</ref> At the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Conference]],<ref>The delegation he headed included [[Florica Bagdasar]], [[Miti<U+0163><U+0103> Constantinescu]], General [[Dumitru D<U+0103>m<U+0103>ceanu]], [[Dimitrie Dimancescu]], [[Richard Franasovici]], [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]], [[Horia Grigorescu]], [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]], [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]], [[Lothar R<U+0103>d<U+0103>ceanu]], [[Mihai Ralea]], [[Simion Stoilow]], [[Elena V<U+0103>c<U+0103>rescu]], [[<U+015E>erban Voinea]], and [[<U+015E>tefan Voitec]]. ("Documente inedite. Rom<U+00E2>nia...", p.16;  [http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Commentary/Paris/DlgtnNames.html ''Paris-WWII Peace Conference-1946: Settling Romania's Western Frontiers. Delegation'', at the Romanian Honorary Consulate in Boston site])</ref> where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]] and P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu, he acknowledged the dissolution of ''[[Greater Romania]]'' under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).<ref>Hitchins, p.526</ref>

==1947 and after==
Tensions between his group with the PCR occurred when the former founded itself as a party under the name of ''National-Liberal Party'' (commonly known as the [[National Liberal Party-T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu]]), and, in June-July 1945, proclaimed its goal to be the preservation of property and a [[middle class]] under a new regime.<ref>Frunz<U+0103>, p.121; Hitchins, p.510-511, 515, 538; <U+0162>urlea, p.31</ref> Of himself and his principles, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu stated:
<blockquote>"I am not a [[Communism|communist]]. Taking in view my attitudes towards mankind, society, property, I am not a communist. Thus, the new orientation in external politics which I demand for my country cannot be accused of being determined by affinities or sympathies of doctrine."<ref>T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu, in <U+0162>urlea, p.31</ref></blockquote>

Speaking in retrospect, Gheorghiu-Dej indicated the actual relation between his party and T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's: "we have had to tolerate by our side a [[Capitalism|capitalist]]-[[gentry]] political group, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's group".<ref>Gheorghiu-Dej, February 1948, in Frunz<U+0103>, p.121</ref>

T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu himself continued to show his support for several PCR policies: in the summer of 1947, he condemned the United States for having protested against the repression of forces in the opposition.<ref>Hitchins, p.533</ref> Nevertheless, at around the same time, he issued his own critique of the Groza government, becoming the target of violent attacks initiated by [[Miron Constantinescu]] in the PCR press.<ref>Cioroianu, p.96-97</ref> Consequently, he was singled out for negligence in office when, during the [[Kangaroo court|kangaroo trial]] of [[Iuliu Maniu]] (''see [[T<U+0103>m<U+0103>d<U+0103>u Affair]]''), it was alleged that several employees of his ministry had [[Conspiracy (political)|conspired]] against the government.<ref>Frunz<U+0103>, p.307-308; Hitchins, p.538</ref> ''[[Sc<U+00EE>nteia]]'', the official voice of the PCR, wrote of all National Liberal Party-T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu offices in the government: "The rot is all-encompassing! It has to be removed!".<ref>''[[Sc<U+00EE>nteia]]'', November 6, 1947, in Frunz<U+0103>, p.121</ref>

T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu resigned his office on [[November 6]], [[1947]], and was replaced by the Communist [[Ana Pauker]]. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures,<ref>Hitchins, p.538</ref> and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with [[Petre N. Bejan]] &mdash; the party was subsequently known as ''National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan'').<ref>Frunz<U+0103>, p.357; Hitchins, p.538</ref> One of his last actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the [[Marshall Plan]].<ref>Cioroianu, p.74</ref>

After the proclamation of the ''[[Communist Romania|People's Republic of Romania]]'' on [[December 30]], [[1947]], the existence of all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of March 28, the [[single-party state]] was confirmed by legislation.<ref>Frunz<U+0103>, p.357</ref> He was arrested on [[May 5]], [[1950]], and held in the notorious [[Sighet prison]]<ref>Gogan; Ioni<U+0163>oiu; Rusan</ref> (alongside three of his brothers &mdash; [[<U+015E>tefan T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu]] included &mdash; and his former collaborator Bejan).<ref>Rusan</ref> His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from [[schizophrenia]] after 1950, and had to be committed to an institution (where he died in 1955).<ref>Petru</ref> Sandra T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>Petru</ref>

One of Gheorghe T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu's last appearances in public was his stand as one of the prosecution's witnesses in the 1954 trial of [[Lucre<U+0163>iu P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]], when he claimed that the defendant had been infiltrated into the PCR during the time when he had been premier (P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu was posthumously cleared of all charges).<ref>Cioroianu, p.228; Ioni<U+0163>oiu</ref> Released in 1955, T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu died in [[Bucharest]], less than two years later.<ref>Gogan; Petru</ref> According to Sanda T<U+0103>t<U+0103>rescu Negropontes, this came as a result of [[tuberculosis]] contracted while in detention.<ref>Petru</ref>
