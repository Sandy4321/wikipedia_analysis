__NOTOC__
Year '''2''' ('''[[Roman numerals|II]]''') was a [[common year starting on Sunday]] or [[Common year starting on Monday|Monday]] (link will display the full calendar) of the [[Julian calendar]] (the sources differ, see [[Julian calendar#Leap year error|leap year error]] for further information) and a [[common year starting on Sunday]] of the [[Proleptic Julian calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the [[Consulship]] of [[Vinicius]] and [[Alfenus Varus|Varus]]''' (or, less frequently, '''year 755 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 2 for this year has been used since the early [[medieval period]], when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
