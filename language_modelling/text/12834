This is a '''list of European Union member states, their dates of application and accession'''. It shows the growth of the [[European Union]] and its predecessors through [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]] from six members in 1952 to twenty-seven members in 2007; [[as of 2007]], at least seven (possibly even more) are expected to join in its future.

The European Union ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'' was created on [[1 November]] [[1993]] when the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty on European Union]] came into effect.<ref>{{ cite web || author=[[European Commission]] || title=1993  || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1993/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> Twelve of the current twenty-seven member states joined one of the Union's predecessors, either the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (which came into existence on [[23 July]] [[1952]]<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1952 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1952/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> and ceased to exist exactly 50 years later<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=2002 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/2002/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref>), the [[European Economic Community]] (which came into existence on [[1 January]] [[1958]]<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1958 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1958/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref>), or the [[European Community]] (which came into existence on [[1 July]] [[1967]] as a merger of ECSC, EEC and the [[Euratom|European Atomic Energy Community]],<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1967 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1967/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> and is one of the [[three pillars of the European Union]] today).

Not all accession attempts have been successful, though, and on one occasion a territory even left the European Union (then European Community).
* While '''[[Norway]]''' had completed European Community/European Union accession negotiations twice already (with the proposed accession dates having been [[1 January]] [[1973]] and [[1 January]] [[1995]], respectively), the accession failed both times when the Norwegians rejected membership in referendums (on [[25 September]] [[1972]]<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1972 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1972/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> and [[28 November]] [[1994]]<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1994 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1994/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref>).
* The [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Autonomous entity|autonomous territory]] of '''[[Greenland]]''' initially joined the European Community together with Denmark, but left on [[1 February]] [[1985]] after it had acquired [[devolution|home rule]] and had held a referendum on the issue.<ref>{{ cite web || author=European Commission || title=1985 || year=[[2005-11-10]] || work=The History of the European Union || url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1985/index_en.htm || accessdate=2006-01-18 }}</ref>
* '''[[Morocco]]''' applied to join in 1987, but was rejected by the [[European Council]] because it was [[Copenhagen criteria#Geographic criteria|not considered a European country]] and therefore not eligible to join.<ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1636915&C=europe || title=EU Mulls Deeper Policy Cooperation with Morocco || publisher=Defense News || date=[[2006-03-22]] || accessdate=2006-07-04 }}</ref> (Interestingly, the Copenhagen criteria had not yet been formally agreed upon at that time.)
* Although '''[[Switzerland]]''' applied to join in 1992, it froze its application after accession to the [[European Economic Area]] was rejected in a referendum on [[6 December]] [[1992]].<ref>{{ cite web || author=British [[Diplomatic mission|Embassy]], [[Berne]] || title=EU and Switzerland || year=[[2006-07-04]] || work=The UK & Switzerland || url=http://www.britishembassy.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&c=Page&cid=1085326325096 || accessdate=2006-07-04 }}</ref>

;Non-European countries

Although the [[Maastricht Treaty|Treaty of Maastricht]] states that only European countries may apply, a number of countries not generally considered European have also considered membership bids. 

The island nation of [[Cape Verde]], part of the island region [[Macaronesia]] (which is comprised of Cape Verde, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] islands of the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] and the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Canary Islands]]) has stated it wishes to join the European Union.<ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/17267 || title=Cape Verde PM discusses special partnership with EU || publisher=afrol News || date=[[2005-11-15]] || accessdate=2006-05-06 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/15920 || title=EU membership for Cape Verde proposed in Portugal || publisher=afrol News || date=[[2005-03-16]] || accessdate=2006-05-06 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/18640 || title=EU, Cape Verde display different interests in integration || publisher=afrol News || date=[[2006-03-30]] || accessdate=2006-05-10 }}</ref> [[Israel]] has considered applying for membership;<ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=295216 || title=Shalom considers asking to join the EU || publisher=[[Haaretz]] || date=[[2003-05-21]] || accessdate=2006-09-09 }}</ref> while the European Union and Israel share a common culture, history and society, the ongoing [[Arab-Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli]] and [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]s and Israel's location in one of the most conflict-ridden regions of the world would be major arguments against its accession. Finally, even [[Canada]]'s accession has occasionally been proposed, though often rather in a [[tongue-in-cheek]] manner;<ref>{{ cite news || author=Staff writer || url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,344556,00.html || title=It's Time For Canada to Join the EU || publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] || date=[[2005-03-03]] || accessdate=2006-09-10 }}</ref> the main arguments used are the very similar cultural standards and viewpoints on matters of [[international law]], especially when juxtaposed with those of the [[United States]]. None of the three countries is a member of the [[Council of Europe]], which is a ''[[de facto]]'' prerequisite for membership under the [[Copenhagen criteria#Geographic criteria|Copenhagen criteria]] and the Treaty of Maastricht.

;Likely next enlargement

It is generally expected that the states of [[Balkans|southeastern Europe]] will be the next states to join the European Union, and that neither the developed countries which are not members of the Union (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the microstates) nor the three countries in eastern Europe (Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine) will join in the foreseeable future.
