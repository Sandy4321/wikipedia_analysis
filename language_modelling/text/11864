'''Hurricane Lili''' was a relatively long-lived hurricane [[1996 Atlantic hurricane season]] that affected countries from Central America to the United Kingdom. Lili formed on October&nbsp;14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October&nbsp;4. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October&nbsp;16 and then to hurricane status on October&nbsp;17. The next day, Lili struck [[Cuba]] and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since [[Hurricane Kate (1985)|Hurricane Kate]] in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category&nbsp;3 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] near the [[Bahamas]]. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical storm]] north of the [[Azores]] on October&nbsp;27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain.

Early in its duration, Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14&nbsp;people. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly due to the hurricane's heavy rainfall which totaled 29.41&nbsp;in (747&nbsp;mm). The hurricane affected 11&nbsp;[[Provinces of Cuba|Cuban provinces]], damaging 92,542&nbsp;houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops, and overall damage in the country was estimated at $362&nbsp;million (1996&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). After 269,995&nbsp;people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300&nbsp;million in damage (1996&nbsp;USD) and six deaths.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Lili 1996 track.png}}
On October&nbsp;4, a [[tropical wave]] exited the west coast of Africa with a large associated [[tropical cyclone#physical structure|circulation]]. Unfavorable [[wind shear]] prevented any [[tropical cyclogenesis|development]], and the wave continued westward, entering the Caribbean Sea on October&nbsp;11. Two days later, the wave axis encountered a pre-existing [[low pressure area]] in the southwest Caribbean. It quickly developed a well-defined circulation, becoming a tropical depression on October&nbsp;14 off the east coast of Nicaragua. Due to an [[cold-core low|upper-level low]] in the Gulf of Mexico, the system tracked to the northwest, brushing [[Central America]] in its path. The depression developed [[Rainband|banding features]] as the pressure gradually dropped, and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili at around 0600&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on October&nbsp;16. During this time, the storm executed a small cyclonic loop while a few hundred miles north of the [[Swan Islands]]. By early on October&nbsp;17, Lili had attained hurricane status while it was turning to the north.<ref name="tcr"/> 

Hurricane Lili grazed [[Isla de la Juventud]] on October&nbsp;18, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to the island. Later that day, Lili made landfall in [[Matanzas Province]], [[Cuba]] as a [[Saffir<U+2013>Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 2]] hurricane, with winds close to {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Despite the mountainous terrain, the storm did not weaken, with the same pressure reading of {{convert|975|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}} being observed at landfall and when Lili reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. After reaching warm waters, Lili further strengthened as it approached the [[Bahamas]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of the storm &ndash; reaching a width of over {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} &ndash; passed over [[San Salvador Island]] and [[Great Exuma]] on October&nbsp;19, and brushed several other islands. That day, a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] in the westerlies caused Lili to accelerate northeastward, reaching a forward speed of almost {{convert|29|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. On October&nbsp;19 at 1200&nbsp;UTC, Hurricane Lili attained its peak intensity for a brief time, reaching {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds and pressure of {{convert|960|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}, both measured by the [[Hurricane Hunters]]. This made Lili the sixth [[Tropical cyclone scales#Atlantic and East Pacific|major hurricane]] &ndash; a category&nbsp;3 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] &ndash; of the season.<ref name="tcr"/>

Within six hours, Lili had weakened below its peak intensity on October&nbsp;19. The center passed {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently the winds gradually decreased. A mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] caused Lili to slow to an east-southeast drift on October&nbsp;22. After two days, the hurricane again accelerated to the northeast, briefly re-intensifying into a category&nbsp;2 hurricane. Lili again started a weakening trend soon after, and by October&nbsp;26, was downgraded to a tropical storm about {{convert|345|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of the [[Azores]]. On October&nbsp;27, it was estimated that Lili became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]], which maintained gale-force winds as it approached Europe. The remnants moved across Ireland and Great Britain on October&nbsp;28 with winds of about {{convert|65|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The remnants of Lili were absorbed by a much larger extratropical system in the [[North Sea]] on October&nbsp;29, which proceeded to cross over the European mainland.<ref name="tcr">{{cite report|author=Miles B.

The storm briefly posed a threat to Mexico, and a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|tropical storm warning]] was issued from [[Chetumal Bay]] to [[Cabo Catoche]] along the eastern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n peninsula]]. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref name="tcr"/>

===Cuba===

[[Image:Lili1996filledrainblk.gif|thumb|right|250 px|Lili's rainfall in Florida]]
[[Tropical cyclone forecast model]]s correctly anticipated that Lili would pass southeast of Florida, despite a potential landfall within 24&nbsp;hours had the storm maintained its previous track.

High waves from the hurricane affected the northern coast of Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding.<ref name="ncdc"/>

On October&nbsp;18, a low pressure area developed near [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which moved up the coastline and struck New England the next day. The system drew moisture from Lili, which dropped heavy rainfall over portions of the northeastern United States that reached {{convert|13.03|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. In the state, the rains flooded hundreds of houses, leaving over $10&nbsp;million in damage. High rainfall and a storm surge flooded coastal portions of Maine, and [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] lost freshwater access for 24&nbsp;hours after a water main broke. There was one indirect death when a man tried driving across a flooded road in [[Cumberland County, Maine|Cumberland County]], and damage in the state totaled over $26&nbsp;million. Heavy rainfall in New Hampshire also caused flooding, and river flooding occurred in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey due to the storm. Farther south in Delaware, the rains caused flash flooding in northern [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], and roadway flooding occurred in eastern Maryland.<ref name="ncdc">{{cite report|title=Severe Weather and Unusual Weather Phenomena for October 1996|publisher=National Climatic Data Center|accessdate=2013-06-18|url=http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS-A68406B2-BA3C-469D-8D9E-0948858C830B.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Bahamas===
A hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas on October&nbsp;17, which was upgraded to a warning and expanded to cover the central Bahamas on the next day. A tropical storm warning was later issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].<ref name="tcr"/> The airport in Nassau was closed before the storm struck, and 40&nbsp;people in Georgetown on [[Exuma]] island evacuated.<ref name="ap1020">{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=1996-10-20|title=Lili Hits Bahamas, Inflicts Scattered Damage; Cuban Crops Hammered|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-06-21|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-20/news/mn-55943_1_scattered-damage}}</ref>

While moving through the Bahamas, Lili produced {{convert|92|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 10&ndash;minute sustained winds on [[San Salvador Island]]. On [[Great Exuma]] island, there was an estimated {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm tide]],<ref name="tcr"/> mostly on the southwestern portion, which caused beach erosion and some coral damage.

===United Kingdom===
On October&nbsp;28, the extratropical remnants of Lili moved over Ireland and the United Kingdom,<ref name="tcr"/> considered the strongest storm to affect the area since 1961.<ref name="ency"/> [[Alderney]] in the [[Channel Islands]] reported {{convert|52|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds, with gusts to 90&nbsp;mph (144&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="tcr"/> [[Swansea]] in [[Wales]] reported gusts of {{convert|92|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, leaving thousands of houses without power in the region. The remnants of Lili produced {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves in [[Bristol Channel]], which heavily damaged about 500&nbsp;cottages in [[Somerset]]. {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} waves in the North Sea removed an oil platform from its moorings, which nearly washed ashore near [[Peterhead]] until a line was reconnected. A {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} storm tide along the [[River Thames]] flooding coastal areas, and high waves washed a sailboat ashore along [[Chale Bay]] in the [[Isle of Wight]]. The remnants of Lili also dropped about {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} of rainfall, which alleviated drought conditions.<ref name="ency"/> The storm killed six people in Great Britain &ndash; four were related to traffic accidents, and two fishermen were swept into the sea.<ref name="tcr"/> Damage was estimated at $300&nbsp;million (1996&nbsp;USD, <U+00A3>150&nbsp;million in 1996 [[pound sterling]]s), making it the costliest storm in the United Kingdom since the [[Great Storm of 1987]].<ref name="ency"/>
