'''''Niantic''''' was a whaleship that brought fortune-seekers to [[Yerba Buena (town)|Yerba Buena]] later renamed [[San Francisco]] during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849. Run aground and converted into a storeship and hotel, she was a prominent landmark in the booming city for several years. The site of ''Niantic'' beside the [[Transamerica Pyramid]] is now a [[California Historical Landmark]]. Artifacts excavated in 1978 and the ship's log from her last voyage are on display in the [[San Francisco Maritime Museum]].

==Early years==
1832<U+2014>''Niantic'' built in [[Connecticut]]. Originally intended for trade with [[China]], she was later converted to a [[sperm whale]]r. Owners in 1840 appear to have been N. L. and G. Griswold of [[New York]].<ref name=Chagres/>

1840<U+2014>''Niantic'', Captain Doty in command (Captain Robert Bennett Forbes acting), sailed with [[tea]] and [[silk]] from Port of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] to an unstated destination (perhaps New York) via Anjer ([[Anyer]]), [[Indonesia]], just missing a [[blockade]] by the British in Canton as part of the [[Opium Wars]]. "Probably this was the last and most profitable voyage of ''Niantic'' as a merchant ship."<ref name=Chagres/>

The [[China trade painting]] of ''Niantic'' at right shows her at the [[Whampoa]] anchorage near [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although the date is unknown, 1840 seems likely.

1844<U+2014>''Niantic'' bought by C. T. Deering for whaling.<ref name=Chagres/>

June 4, 1844<U+2014>''Niantic'' sailed from [[Sag Harbor]], Captain Slate in command, for Pacific whaling cruise, including New Zealand whaling grounds.<ref name=Chagres/>

February 1, 1847<U+2014>''Niantic'' returned to Sag Harbor after voyage of nearly three years.<ref name=Chagres/>

1847<U+2014>''Niantic'' purchased by Burr & Smith of [[Warren, Rhode Island|Warren]], [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=Chagres/>

September 16, 1848<U+2014>''Niantic'' sailed from Warren, Captain Henry Cleaveland of [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts]] ([[Martha's Vineyard]]) in command,<ref>[http://www.maritimeheritage.org/captains/cleavelandHenry.html "Henry Cleaveland (aka Henry Cleveland)"], entry at The Maritime Heritage Project</ref> headed for northwest Pacific. His sons James and Daniel Cleaveland were first and second mates, respectively.<ref name=Chagres/>

==Peru, Panama, and the race to California, 1849==

After rounding [[Cape Horn]] in January 1849, ''Niantic'' put into Paita (Payta), [[Peru]] on March 8, and received a letter there from the American consul in Panama requesting them to carry passengers from [[Panama]] to San Francisco. Large numbers of people (in some accounts referred to as [[Argonaut (Gold Rush)|Argonauts]]) had crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and were waiting on the Pacific coast for transportation to [[California]]; the gold rush had begun. The vessel was immediately modified to carry passengers above and below the [[weather deck]]. They departed Paita for Panama on March 25, taking 150 mules, perhaps 200 barrels of potatoes, a large amount of lumber, and other supplies.

Arriving on the Panama coast April 8, ''Niantic'' spent nearly four weeks in preparations. She departed for San Francisco May 2 with 246 passengers; 20 are reported to have been accommodated in the captain's cabin alone. Sixteen passengers paid $250 each, and the remaining paid $150, or an unrecorded amount. Thus, the total passenger fees probably amounted to $38,500. One slave was included among the passengers. Two passengers died en route.

Experience whaling in the [[Pacific]] and familiarity with its winds gave Cleaveland an advantage over other ships in the race to San Francisco; for 28 days he headed generally southwest, against the vocal objections of dismayed passengers, before catching the southeast [[trade wind]]s beginning May 24, and finally turning northwest May 30. ''Niantic'' was thus one of the first ships to bring gold seekers to San Francisco, arriving at 11 pm July 5, 1849.

==Storeship and hotel==

[[Image:Niantic_storeship_(San_Francisco).jpg|thumb|400px|The Niantic Hotel in 1850]]

In San Francisco harbor, most of the crew deserted to join the gold rush. ''Niantic's'' log records that five of the crew deserted the first day, nine the second day, three more deserted the fourth day and two were arrested by the [[USS Warren (1827)|US Sloop of War ''Warren'']] for assaulting Captain Cleaveland with a knife, and five were released the sixth day (including one released by the ''Warren''). This may have left a crew as small as five to finish unloading the ship. The ''Niantic's'' log ends the next day, July 12, 1849.

Without a crew to sail, and with more ships arriving daily, the officers of ''Niantic'' were instructed by her owners, probably through an agent in San Francisco, to sell the vessel. With the aid of her empty [[whale oil]] barrels tied to her hull for extra buoyancy, the ship was floated on a high tide into shallow water, just offshore from the intersection of Clay and Montgomery Streets. Now hard aground, ''Niantic'' was converted for use variously as a warehouse, store,<ref>{{Cite book

offices, and hotel.

Access was first by a pier or footbridge, but later, the sandy bluffs along [[Montgomery Street]] were flattened and the shallows around the ship were filled.

The Cleavelands appear to have purchased the smaller vessel ''Mary Wilder'', and were able to sail out of San Francisco with a crew of just six.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Fires, 1850-1852==

The converted vessel burned repeatedly in the fires that devastated the new city of San Francisco over the next several years, but was repeatedly rebuilt as the Niantic Hotel, looking less like a ship each time. The Niantic Hotel was described in about 1852 as the finest hotel in San Francisco.

==1872, 1907, 1919==

The hull of ''Niantic'' was rediscovered when the old Niantic Hotel was demolished in 1872. Thirty-five baskets of champagne were found in the ruins.

In 1907, ''Niantic'' was again discovered during rebuilding from the [[San Francisco Fire]] of 1906. A new Niantic Building was constructed.

A plaque was placed at 505 Sansome at Clay by the Historic Landmarks Committee of the Native Sons of the Golden West, on September 19, 1919.

==Excavation, 1978==

''Niantic'' was rediscovered once again in 1978 during excavation for the Mark Twain Plaza Complex next to the [[Transamerica Pyramid|Transamerica Building]], now about six blocks from the waterfront. Excavations were hurried, and there was little time for preservation or study.

One last basket of intact bottles of champagne ([http://www.champagnejacquesson.com Jacquesson et Fils]) was found deep in the charred remnants of the hull. One of these bottles was later given to [[Dionis Coffin Riggs]], the great granddaughter of Captain Cleaveland, in appreciation for donating the ship's log to investigators.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Although some of the ''Niantic's'' remains were removed to a landfill, a portion of the bow remains undisturbed under a parking lot, perhaps to be "rediscovered" yet again in the future.

==California Historic Landmark==

The site of ''Niantic'' is designated as [[List of California Historical Landmarks|California Historical Landmark]] #88.

==San Francisco Maritime Museum==

A portion of the ''Niantic's'' hull and rudder, with several related artifacts, is in the [[San Francisco Maritime Museum]]. The display includes the ship's log kept by First Mate James Cleaveland, recording the arrival in San Francisco. A diorama shows the ship as she is believed to have appeared in 1850, converted to a storeship but not yet landlocked.<ref>[http://www.momentsintimeexhibits.com/DW-NianticDesBkForwrdAlt.html Photographs of exhibit]</ref>
