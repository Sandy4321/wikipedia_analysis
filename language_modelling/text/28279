A '''burn''' is a type of [[injury]] to [[flesh]] or [[skin]] caused by [[heat]], [[electricity]], [[chemicals]], [[friction]], or [[radiation]].<ref name=TBCChp4/> Burns that affect only the superficial skin are known as superficial or first-degree burns. When damage penetrates into some of the underlying layers, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as [[muscle]] or [[bone]]. 

<!--Management  -->
The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than [[analgesics|simple pain relievers]], while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized [[burn center]]s. Cooling with tap water may help relieve pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged exposure may result in [[hypothermia|low body temperature]]. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as [[skin grafting]].  Extensive burns often require large amounts of [[intravenous fluids]] because the subsequent inflammatory response will result in significant [[capillary]] fluid leakage and [[edema]]. The most common complications of burns are related to [[infection]].

<!-- Epidemiology -->
While large burns can be fatal, modern treatments developed since 1960 have significantly improved the outcomes, especially in children and young adults.<ref name=TBCChp1/> Globally, about 11&nbsp;million people seek medical treatment, and 300,000 die from burns each year.<ref name=Epi2011/> In the United States, approximately 4% of those admitted to a [[burn center]] die from their injuries.<ref name=ABA2012/> The long-term outcome is primarily related to the size of burn and the age of the person affected.

==Signs and symptoms==
The characteristics of a burn depend upon its depth. Superficial burns cause pain lasting two or three days, followed by peeling of the skin over the next few days.<ref name=EMP2009/><ref name=TBCChp10/> Individuals suffering from more severe burns may indicate discomfort or complain of feeling pressure rather than pain. Full-thickness burns may be entirely insensitive to light touch or puncture.<ref name=TBCChp10/> While superficial burns are typically red in color, severe burns may be pink, white or black.<ref name=TBCChp10/> Burns around the mouth or singed hair inside the nose may indicate that burns to the airways have occurred, but these findings are not definitive.<ref name=Schw2010/> More worrisome signs include: [[shortness of breath]], hoarseness, and [[stridor]] or [[wheezing]].<ref name=Schw2010/> [[Pruritus|Itchiness]] is common during the healing process, occurring in up to 90% of adults and nearly all children.<ref name=Itchy2009>{{cite journal|last=Goutos|first=I|coauthors=Dziewulski, P; Richardson, PM|title=Pruritus in burns: review article.|journal=Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association|date=2009 Mar-Apr|volume=30|issue=2|pages=221<U+2013>8|pmid=19165110}}</ref> Numbness or tingling may persist for a prolonged period of time after an electrical injury.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Burns may also produce emotional and psychological distress.<ref name=Epi2011/>

==Cause==
Burns are caused by a variety of external sources classified as thermal, chemical, electrical, and radiation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kowalski|first=Caroline Bunker Rosdahl, Mary T.|title=Textbook of basic nursing|year=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6521-3|page=1109|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=odY9mXicPlYC&pg=PA1109|edition=9th}}</ref> In the United States, the most common causes of burns are: fire or flame (44%), scalds (33%), hot objects (9%), electricity (4%), and chemicals (3%).<ref name=ABA2012pgi>National Burn Repository Pg. i</ref> Most (69%) burn injuries occur at home or at work (9%),<ref name=ABA2012>{{cite web|title=Burn Incidence and Treatment in the United States: 2012 Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ameriburn.org/resources_factsheet.php|work=American Burn Association|accessdate=20 April 2013|year=2012}}</ref> and most are accidental, with 2% due to assault by another, and 1-2% resulting from a [[suicide]] attempt.<ref name=Epi2011/> These sources can cause inhalation injury to the airway and/or lungs, occurring in about 6%.<ref name=TBCChp3/>

Burn injuries occur more commonly in the poor.<!-- <ref name=Epi2011/> --> Smoking is a risk factor, although alcohol use is not.<!-- <ref name=Epi2011/> --> Fire-related burns are generally more common in colder climates.<ref name=Epi2011/> Specific risk factors in the developing world include cooking with open fires or on the floor<ref name=TBCChp4/> as well as [[developmental disabilities]] in children and chronic diseases in adults.<ref name=LMIC2006/>

===Thermal===
In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%.<ref name=TBCChp4/> Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire.<ref name=TBCChp4/> [[Scalding]] is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature [[tap water]] in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam.<ref>{{cite book|editors=Murphy, Catherine; Gardiner, Mark; Sarah Eisen |title=Training in paediatrics : the essential curriculum|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-922773-0|page=36|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=FLBMvTff9sMC&pg=PA36|coauthors=Eisen, Sarah; Murphy, Catherine}}</ref> Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five<ref name=Tint2010/> and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20-30% of burns in children.<ref name=TBCChp3/> Generally, scalds are first or second degree burns, but third degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact.<ref name=Mag2008/> [[Fireworks]] are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peden|first=Margie|title=World report on child injury prevention|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-156357-4|page=86|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UeXwoNh8sbwC&pg=PA86}}</ref> This is a particular risk for adolescent males.<ref>{{cite web|title=World report on child injury prevention|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/child/injury/world_report/Burns_english.pdf|author=World Health Organization}}</ref>

===Chemical===
{{Main|Chemical burn}}
Chemicals cause from 2 to 11% of all burns and contribute to as many as 30% of burn-related deaths.<ref name=Hard2012>{{cite journal|last=Hardwicke|first=J|coauthors=Hunter, T; Staruch, R; Moiemen, N|title=Chemical burns--an historical comparison and review of the literature.|journal=Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries|date=2012 May|volume=38|issue=3|pages=383<U+2013>7|pmid=22037150}}</ref> Chemical burns can be caused by over 25,000 substances,<ref name=Tint2010/> most of which are either a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] (55%) or a strong [[acid]] (26%).<ref name=Hard2012/> Most chemical burn deaths are secondary to  [[ingestion]].<ref name=Tint2010/> Common agents include: [[sulfuric acid]] as found in toilet cleaners, [[sodium hypochlorite]] as found in bleach, and [[halogenated hydrocarbons]] as found in paint remover, among others.<ref name=Tint2010/> [[Hydrofluoric acid]] can cause particularly deep burns which may not become symptomatic until some time after exposure.<ref name=HF2008>{{cite journal|last=Makarovsky|first=I|coauthors=Markel, G; Dushnitsky, T; Eisenkraft, A|title=Hydrogen fluoride--the protoplasmic poison.|journal=The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ|date=2008 May|volume=10|issue=5|pages=381<U+2013>5|pmid=18605366}}</ref> [[Formic acid]] may cause the breakdown of significant numbers of [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=Schw2010/>

===Electrical===
{{main|Electrical burn}}
Electrical burns or injuries are classified as high voltage (greater than or equal to 1000&nbsp;[[volts]]), low voltage (less than 1000&nbsp;[[volts]]), or as [[flash burn]]s secondary to an [[electric arc]].<ref name=Tint2010/> The most common causes of electrical burns in children are electrical cords (60%) followed by electrical outlets (14%).<ref name=TBCChp3/> [[Lightning]] may also result in electrical burns.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edlich|first=RF|coauthors=Farinholt, HM; Winters, KL; Britt, LD; Long WB, 3rd|title=Modern concepts of treatment and prevention of lightning injuries.|journal=Journal of long-term effects of medical implants|year=2005|volume=15|issue=2|pages=185<U+2013>96|pmid=15777170}}</ref> Risk factors for being struck include involvement in outdoor activities such as mountain climbing, golf and field sports, and working outside.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Mortality from a lightning strike is about 10%.<ref name=RosenChp140/>

While electrical injuries primarily result in burns, they may also cause [[fractures]] or [[dislocations]] secondary to [[blunt force trauma]] or [[muscle contraction]]s.<ref name=RosenChp140/> In high voltage injuries, most damage may occur internally and thus the extent of the injury cannot be judged by examination of the skin alone.<ref name=RosenChp140/> Contact with either low voltage or high voltage may produce [[cardiac arrhythmias]] or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=RosenChp140/>

===Radiation===
{{Main|Radiation burn}}
[[Radiation burns]] may be caused by protracted exposure to [[ultraviolet light]] (such as from the sun, [[tanning booths]] or [[arc welding]]) or from [[ionizing radiation]] (such as from [[radiation therapy]], [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive fallout]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Prahlow|first=Joseph|title=Forensic pathology for police, death investigators, and forensic scientists|year=2010|publisher=Humana|location=Totowa, N.J.|isbn=978-1-59745-404-9|page=485|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=rF1WTiX0nHEC&pg=PA485}}</ref> Sun exposure is the most common cause of radiation burns and the most common cause of superficial burns overall.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kearns RD, Cairns CB, Holmes JH, Rich PB, Cairns BA |title=Thermal burn care: a review of best practices.

===Non accidental===
In those hospitalized from scalds or fire burns, 3{{endash}}10% are from assault.<ref name=Peck2012/> Reasons include: [[child abuse]], personal disputes, spousal abuse, elder abuse, and business disputes.<ref name=Peck2012/> An immersion injury or immersion scald may indicate child abuse.<ref name=Mag2008>{{cite journal|last=Maguire|first=S|coauthors=Moynihan, S; Mann, M; Potokar, T; Kemp, AM|title=A systematic review of the features that indicate intentional scalds in children.|journal=Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries|date=2008 Dec|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1072<U+2013>81|pmid=18538478}}</ref> It is created when an extremity or the lower body (buttock or [[perineum]]) is held under the surface of hot water.<ref name=Mag2008/> It typically produces a sharp upper border and is often symmetrical.<ref name=Mag2008/> Other high-risk signs of potential abuse include: circumferential burns, the absence of splash marks, a burn of uniform depth, and association with other signs of neglect or abuse.<ref name=TBCChp61/>

[[Bride burning]], a form of [[domestic violence]], occurs in some cultures such as India where a woman is burned due to what the husband or his family consider to be an inadequate [[dowry]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jutla|first=RK|coauthors=Heimbach, D|title=Love burns: An essay about bride burning in India.|journal=The Journal of burn care & rehabilitation|date=2004 Mar-Apr|volume=25|issue=2|pages=165<U+2013>70|pmid=15091143}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Peden|first=Margie|title=World report on child injury prevention|year=2008|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva, Switzerland|isbn=978-92-4-156357-4|page=82|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=UeXwoNh8sbwC&pg=PA82}}</ref> In Pakistan, [[acid throwing|acid burns]] represent 13% of intentional burns, and are frequently related to domestic violence.<ref name=TBCChp61>{{cite book|editor=Herndon D|title=Total burn care|publisher=Saunders|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-4377-2786-9|page=689-698|edition=4th|chapter=Chapter 61: Intential burn injuries}}</ref> [[Self-immolation]] (setting oneself on fire as a form of protest) is also relatively common among Indian women.<ref name=Epi2011/>

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Burn Degree Diagram.svg|thumb|Three degrees of burns]]
At temperatures greater than {{convert|44|C|F}}, proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down.<ref name=Rosen2009>{{cite book|last=Marx|first=John|title=Rosen's emergency medicine : concepts and clinical practice|year=2010|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-05472-0|edition=7th |chapter=Chapter 60:  Thermal Burns}}</ref> This results in cell and tissue damage.<ref name=Tint2010/> Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin.<ref name=Tint2010/> They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature.<ref name=Tint2010/> Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium.<ref name=Tint2010/> 

In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response.<ref name=Roj2012>{{cite journal |author=Rojas Y, Finnerty CC, Radhakrishnan RS, Herndon DN |title=Burns: an update on current pharmacotherapy |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=13 |issue=17 |pages=2485<U+2013>94 |year=2012 |month=December |pmid=23121414 |pmc=3576016 |doi=10.1517/14656566.2012.738195 |url=}}</ref> This results in increased leakage of fluid from the [[capillaries]],<ref name=Schw2010/> and subsequent tissue [[edema]].<ref name=Tint2010/> This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant [[Blood plasma|plasma]] loss, making the blood more concentrated.<ref name=Tint2010/> Poor blood flow to [[organs]] such as the kidneys and [[gastrointestinal tract]] may result in [[renal failure]] and [[gastric ulcers|stomach ulcers]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hannon|first=Ruth|title=Porth pathophysiology : concepts of altered health states|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-1-60547-781-7|page=1516|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=2-MFXOEG0lcC&pg=PA1516|edition=1st Canadian}}</ref>

Increased levels of [[catecholamines]] and [[cortisol]] may result in a [[hypermetabolism|hypermetabolic state]] which can last for years.<ref name=Roj2012/> This is associated with increased [[cardiac output]], [[metabolism]], [[tachycardia|a fast heart rate]], and poor [[immune suppression|immune function]].<ref name=Roj2012/>

==Diagnosis==
Burns can be classified by depth, mechanism of injury, extent, and associated injuries. The most commonly used classification is based on the depth of injury. The depth of a burn is usually determined via examination, although a biopsy may also be used.<ref name=Tint2010/> It may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of a burn on a single examination and repeated examinations over a few days may be necessary.<ref name=Schw2010/> In those who have a [[headache]] or are dizzy and have a fire-related burn, [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] should be considered.<ref name=CEM2012/> [[Cyanide poisoning]] should also be considered.<ref name=Schw2010>{{cite book|last=Brunicardi|first=Charles|title=Schwartz's principles of surgery|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill, Medical Pub. Division|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-154769-7|edition=9th|chapter=Chapter 8:  Burns}}</ref>

===Size===
The size of a burn is measured as a percentage of [[total body surface area]] (TBSA) affected by partial thickness or full thickness burns.<ref name=Tint2010/> First-degree burns that are only red in color and are not blistering are not included in this estimation.<ref name=Tint2010/> Most burns (70%) involve less than 10% of the TBSA.<ref name=TBCChp3/>

There are a number of methods to determine the TBSA, including the "rule of nines", Lund and Browder charts, and estimations based on a person's palm size.<ref name=EMP2009/> The rule of nines is easy to remember but only accurate in people over 16&nbsp;years of age.<ref name=EMP2009/> More accurate estimates can be made using Lund and Browder charts, which take into account the different proportions of body parts in adults and children.<ref name=EMP2009/> The size of a person's handprint (including the palm and fingers) is approximately 1% of their TBSA.<ref name=EMP2009/>

In order to determine the need for referral to a specialized burn unit, the American Burn Association devised a classification system. Under this system, burns can be classified as major, moderate and minor. This is assessed based on a number of factors, including total body surface area affected, the involvement of specific anatomical zones, the age of the person, and associated injuries.<ref name=CEM2012/> Minor burns can typically be managed at home, moderate burns are often managed in hospital, and major burns are managed by a burn center.<ref name=CEM2012>{{cite book|last=Garmel|first=edited by S.V.

==Management==
Resuscitation begins with the assessment and stabilization of the person's airway, breathing and circulation.<ref name=EMP2009/> If inhalation injury is suspected, early [[intubation]] maybe required.<ref name=Schw2010/> This is followed by care of the burn wound itself.
