After [[Finland's declaration of independence]] the parish became an issue in Finnish-Russian relations when its population held a vote in August [[1918]] to join Finland. The Finnish Army moved to occupy Repola in October. In the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian<U+2013>Finnish)|Treaty of Tartu]], [[1920]], Finland gave up her claims on Repola and the neighbouring [[Poraj<U+00E4>rvi]], and instead received [[Petsamo]] in the far north.

The inhabitants of Repola did however not give up, and in [[1921]] they started a rebellion against the [[Bolshevik]]. The resistance movement, the [[Mets<U+00E4>sissit]] (literally ''Forest Guerillas'') received volunteers from Finland and managed to capture large parts of [[East Karelia]]. The Bolsheviks fought back, and in [[1922]] the last guerillas withdrew to Finland.

During the negotiations prior to the [[Winter War]] [[Stalin]] offered Repola and Poraj<U+00E4>rvi in exchange for a smaller area on the [[Karelian Isthmus]]. The offer was rejected. 

Repola was occupied ([[1941]]&ndash;[[1944]]) by the [[Finnish 14th Division (Continuation War)|Finnish 14th Division]] during the [[Continuation War]], until it was recaptured by Soviet forces.
