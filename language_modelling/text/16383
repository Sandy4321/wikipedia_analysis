'''''Imperator Pavel I''''' ({{lang-ru| '''<U+0418><U+043C><U+043F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0430><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440> <U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+0435><U+043B> I'''}} - [[Paul I of Russia|Czar Paul I]]) was a {{sclass|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship|0}} [[predreadnought battleship]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the mid-1900s. The ship's construction was seriously extended by design changes as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and labor unrest after the [[1905 Revolution]] and she took nearly six years to build. ''Imperator Pavel I'' was not very active during [[World War I]] and her bored sailors were the first to mutiny in early 1917. The ship was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] in 1918 and she was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1923.

==Description==
''Imperator Pavel I'' was {{convert|454|ft|m|1}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|460|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|80|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|18902|LT|t|0}} at [[deep load]]. Her hull was subdivided by 17 transverse watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and the engine rooms were divided by a centerline longitudinal bulkhead. She had a [[double bottom]] and a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|4|ft|m|1}}.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 180, 185</ref>

''Imperator Pavel I'' had two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple-expansion steam engines]] with a total designed output of {{convert|17600|ihp|lk=in}}. Twenty-five [[Belleville boiler]]s provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of {{convert|285|psi|kPa kg/cm2|lk=on}}. On [[sea trial]]s, the engines produced {{convert|18596|ihp|abbr=on}} and a top speed of {{convert|18.5|knots}}. She carried a normal load of {{convert|800|LT|t}} of coal that provided a range of {{convert|1300|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a maximum load of {{convert|1500|LT|t}} that gave {{convert|2400|nmi}} at the same speed.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 181, 187</ref>

The main armament consisted of two pairs of [[Russian 12 inch 40 caliber naval gun|12-inch Model 1895]] 40-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] guns mounted in twin-[[gun turret]]s fore and aft. These guns had a maximum elevation of 35<U+00B0> and could depress to -5<U+00B0>. 80 rounds per gun were carried and they could fire one round per minute. Eight of the fourteen {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} Model 1905 45-caliber guns were mounted in four twin-gun turret at the corners of the superstructure while six were mounted in [[casemate]]s in the superstructure. For defense against [[torpedo boat]]s, ''Imperator Pavel I'' carried twelve {{convert|120|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} guns mounted in casemates above the 8-inch guns in the superstructure. Two underwater {{convert|457|mm|adj=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s were mounted, one on each side, and they were provided with six spare torpedoes.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 186</ref> 

Based on the Russian experience at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], the sides of the ship's hull were completely protected by [[Krupp cemented armor]]. The main waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] had a maximum thickness of {{convert|8.5|in|0}} and the upper belt was {{convert|5|in|0}} at its thickest. The sides of the main gun turrets were {{convert|8|in|0}} thick and the armor of the casemates ranged from {{convert|3.1|to|5|in|0}} in thickness. The greatest thickness of [[deck (ship)|deck]] armor was {{convert|1.5|in|0}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 181</ref>

==Service history==
''Imperator Pavel I'' was built by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Construction began on 27 October 1904<ref group=Note>All dates used in this article are [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]</ref> and was slowed by labor trouble in the shipyard from the 1905 Revolution. She was launched on 7 September 1907 and began her sea trials in October 1910. The ship entered service on 10 March 1911 before her trials were completed in October 1911.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 180</ref> ''Imperator Pavel I'' joined the Baltic Fleet on completion and she made a port visit to [[Copenhagen]] in September 1912. The following September she visited [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], [[Cherbourg]], and [[Stavanger]]. At the beginning of World War I she covered Russian [[minelaying]] operations at the entrance of the [[Gulf of Finland]].<ref name=m2/> She did little else for the rest of the war as the Russian naval strategy in the Baltic was defensive; the four {{sclass|Gangut|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts and the two {{sclass|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship|0}} predreadnoughts were to defend the entrance to the [[Gulf of Finland]].<ref>Halpern, p. 190</ref> The ship's lattice masts were cut down in late 1914 and light topmasts were added. [[Torpedo net]]s were fitted in early 1915 and the ship's torpedoes were removed in January 1916. In late 1916, four {{convert|76|mm|0|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were added.<ref name=m2/> 

Disgruntled sailors aboard ''Imperator Pavel I'' instigated the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet in [[Helsinki]] on 16 March 1917, after they received word of the [[February Revolution]] in Saint Petersburg, and the ship was renamed ''Respublika'' (''Republic'') on 29 April. The [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] required the Soviets to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have their ships interned by newly independent [[Finland]] even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over. ''Respublika'' and her sister ship {{ship|Russian battleship|Andrei Pervozvanny||2}} led the second group of ships on 5 April and reached [[Kronstadt]] five days later in what became known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet|'Ice Voyage']]. The ship was laid up in October 1918 for lack of manpower and she was scrapped beginning on 22 November 1923. Curiously, ''Respublika'' was not formally stricken from the [[Navy List]] until 21 November 1925.<ref name=m2>McLaughlin, pp. 188, 300<U+2013>02</ref>
