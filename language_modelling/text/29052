'''''The Headphone Masterpiece''''' is the [[debut album]] by American recording artist [[Cody Chesnutt]]. He recorded the album in his home bedroom with a [[4-track recorder]] and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an [[organ (music)|organ]]. A 36-song [[double album]], ''The Headphone Masterpiece'' features [[neo soul]] and [[lo-fi music]], and distorted, [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as falling in love with his wife and reconciling his love for [[rock and roll]] with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.

After unsuccessfully shopping the album to record companies, Chesnutt released it himself on his website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 through his own label Ready, Set, Go!. The album charted for one week on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and had sold 25,000 copies by March 30, 2003, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]. ''The Headphone Masterpiece'' was well received by music critics, who found it musically adventurous, albeit indulgent.

== Recording ==
After his band [[The Crosswalk]] was dropped from [[Hollywood Records]] in 1997, [[Cody Chesnutt]] spent several months recording ''The Headphone Masterpiece'' in his bedroom, which he used as a makeshift studio called the Sonic Promiseland,<ref name="Fader">{{cite journal|journal=[[The Fader]]|last=Robinson|first=Knox|year=2002|page=135|issue=12|location=New York}}</ref> in Valley Village, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8200369&style=music&fulldesc=T|title=Cody ChesnuTT <U+2013> Headphone Masterpiece CD Album|publisher=[[CD Universe]].

A 36-song [[double album]], ''The Headphone Masterpiece'' has [[overdubbing|overdubbed]], distorted production,<ref name="Fader"/> and incorporates [[pop rock]], [[soul music|soul]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] styles.<ref name="Gowan"/> Music journalist [[Philip Sherburne]] said that it explores [[British Invasion]] music on songs such as "Upstarts in a Blowout", [[synth-pop]] on "The World Is Coming to My Party", and "cheerfully misogynist" hip hop on "Bitch, I'm Broke", but the album's "core is classic soul".<ref name="Sherburne"/> Jared Levy of [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] called it a [[neo soul]] album,<ref name="Levy">{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Jared|date=August 24, 2011|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/delorean/cody-chesnutt-headphone-masterpiece|title=Cody ChesnuTT <U+2013> The Headphone Masterpiece|publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[The Fader]]'' magazine's Knox Robinson categorized it as [[lo-fi music]].<ref name="Fader"/>

Chesnutt's lyrics mix irony and sincerity.<ref name="Hampton"/> He wrote the album to express the complexity of his personal experiences, such as falling in love with his wife, [[rock and roll]], and reconciling his love for the music with the trappings of the [[Social effects of rock music|rock lifestyle]].<ref name="Fader"/> [[Pitchfork Media]]'s Rob Mitchum wrote that "Serve This Royalty" celebrates Chesnutt's "cultural sect", and "The Seed" mixes his "hypersexual egotism" with "a tone of evolutionary bravado."<ref name="Mitchum"/> On the former song, Chesnutt sings "Thank you Jesus / For my mama / Thank you bitches / For my money". He said of recording the song, "I woke up, went to the organ, and played these chords".<ref name="Hampton"/> Following "Bitch, I'm Broke", the album features a [[suite (music)|suite]] of songs written about Chesnutt's wife and the pleasures of monogamy.<ref name="Hampton"/>

== Release and promotion ==
Chesnutt shopped the album around to record companies, but they mistook it for a [[demo (music)|demo]] and rejected it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals.<ref name="Hampton"/> He said in an interview for ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' at the time, "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had in my bedroom? To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do."<ref name="Hampton"/> In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website,<ref name="billboard"/> and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go!.<ref name="Hampton"/>

Chesnutt performed at clubs in Los Angeles in the album's promotion.<ref name="billboard"/> He subsequently toured with [[Macy Gray]], [[Erykah Badu]], and [[The Roots]], who covered his song "[[The Seed (2.0)|The Seed]]" on their 2002 album ''[[Phrenology (album)|Phrenology]]''.<ref name="billboard"/> The band released a music video for the song featuring Chesnutt, which received airplay on [[MTV]].<ref name="billboard"/> Consequently, ''The Headphone Masterpiece'' entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 128 with sales of 8,000 copies.
