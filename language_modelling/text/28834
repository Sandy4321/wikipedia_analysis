The '''Pintail''' or  '''Northern Pintail''' (''Anas acuta'') is a [[duck]] with wide geographic [[Range (biology)|distribution]] that breeds in the northern areas of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. It is [[bird migration|migratory]] and winters south of its [[breeding range]] to the [[equator]]. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical [[subspecies]] if the possibly [[conspecific]] duck [[Eaton's Pintail]] is considered to be a separate species.

This is a large duck, and the  male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage.  The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female [[dabbling duck]]s.  Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.

The Northern Pintail is a bird of open [[wetland]]s which nests on the ground, often some distance from water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small [[invertebrate]]s to its diet during the [[nesting season]]. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also had a significant impact on numbers. Nevertheless, the fact that this species has huge range and large population mean that it is not threatened globally.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his ''Systema naturae'' in 1758 as ''Anas acuta''.<ref name=" Linnaeus ">{{la icon}} {{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=Carolus | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

Eaton's Pintail has two subspecies, ''A. e. eatoni'' (the Kerguelen Pintail) of [[Kerguelen Islands]], and ''A. e. drygalskyi'' (the Crozet Pintail) of [[Crozet Islands]], and was formerly considered conspecific with the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere's]] Northern Pintail.

==Description==
[[File:Anas acuta male.JPG|thumb|Male in [[river Ljubljanica]], Slovenia]]
The Northern Pintail is a fairly large duck with a [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] of 23.6<U+2013>28.2&nbsp;cm (9.3<U+2013>11.1&nbsp;in) and wingspan of {{convert|80|-|95|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A. and Sargatal, J. (1992) ''Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 1: Ostrich to Ducks''. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona.</ref> The male is 59<U+2013>76&nbsp;cm (23<U+2013>30&nbsp;in) in length and weighs 450<U+2013>1360&nbsp;grammes (1<U+2013>3&nbsp;lb), and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is 51<U+2013>64&nbsp;cm (20<U+2013>25&nbsp;in) long and weighs 454<U+2013>1135&nbsp;grammes (1<U+2013>2.5&nbsp;lb).<ref name= umich/> The Northern Pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly-widespread [[Mallard]], but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding [[plumage]]d male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail,<ref name=Madge/> which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in). The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.<ref name= Gooders >{{cite book | last = Gooders | first = John | coauthors= Boyer, Trevor |title = Ducks of Britain and the Northern Hemisphere | year = 1997 | pages = 58<U+2013>61 | publisher = Collins & Brown | isbn =1-85585-570-4}}</ref>

The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill.<ref name=Madge/> In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake Pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown [[speculum feathers|speculum]] with a narrower trailing edge.<ref name=Collins/>

The Pintail walks well on land, and swims well.<ref name=Madge/> It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female's speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of 1600&nbsp;metres (1&nbsp;mi).<ref name=Collins/>

The male's call is a soft ''proop-proop'' whistle, similar to that of the [[Common Teal]], whereas the female has a [[Mallard|Mallard-like]] descending quack, and a low croak when flushed.<ref name=Madge/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Northern Pintail (Males) near Hodal I IMG 9252.jpg|thumb|Non-breeding males wintering in India]]

This [[dabbling duck]] breeds across northern areas of [[Eurasia]] south to about [[Poland]] and [[Mongolia]],<ref name= umich/> and in [[Canada]], [[Alaska]] and the [[Midwestern United States]]. It winters mainly south of its breeding range, reaching almost to the equator in [[Panama]], northern [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and tropical [[South Asia]]. Small numbers migrate to [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] islands, particularly  [[Hawaii]], where a few hundred birds winter on the main islands in shallow [[wetland]]s and flooded agricultural habitats.<ref name=Madge/> [[Ocean|Transoceanic]] journeys also occur: a bird that was caught and [[bird ringing|ringed]] in [[Labrador]], Canada, was shot by a hunter in England nine days later,<ref name=umich/> and [[Japan|Japanese-ringed]] birds have been recovered from six US states east to [[Utah]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref name = ESPN>{{cite web|title= From Tokyo to Tupelo |work= ESPN Outdoors News |url= http://web.archive.org/web/20090901062142/http://sports.espn.go.com/outdoors/general/news/story?id=3200913|author=Towell, Larry |date=23 January 2008| publisher= ESPN Outdoors |accessdate=23 January 2008}}</ref> In parts of the range, such as [[Great Britain]] and the northwestern United States, the Pintail may be present all year.<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter.

The Northern Pintail's breeding habitat is open unwooded wetlands, such as wet grassland, lakesides or tundra. In winter, it will utilise a wider range of open habitats, such as sheltered estuaries, brackish marshes and coastal lagoons. It is highly gregarious outside the breeding season and forms very large mixed flocks with other ducks.<ref name=Madge/>

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
[[Image:2005.01.10-10.18.52-(DSCF00.jpg|thumb|Breeding pair]]
Both sexes reach sexual maturity at one year of age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there is a group of males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers on the back of her head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.<ref name= umich/>

Breeding takes place between April and June, with the nest being constructed on the ground and hidden amongst vegetation in a dry location, often some distance from water. It is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with plant material and down.<ref name= Madge/> The female lays seven to nine cream-coloured eggs at the rate of one per day;<ref name= umich/> the eggs are 55&nbsp;x&nbsp;38 millimetres (2.2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;in) in size and weigh 45&nbsp;grammes (1.6&nbsp;oz), of which 7% is shell.<ref name= BTO/> If predators destroy the first clutch, the female can produce a replacement clutch as late as the end of July.<ref name= umich/>

The hen alone incubates the eggs for 22 to 24 days before they hatch. The [[precocial]] downy chicks are then led by the female to the nearest body of water, where they feed on dead insects on the water surface. The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has completed [[moult]]ing.<ref name= umich/>

Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce.<ref name= umich/> The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] bird.<ref name = BTO>{{cite web|title= Pintail ''Anas acuta'' [Linnaeus, 1758] |work= BTO''Web'' BirdFacts|url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob1890.htm |publisher=British Trust for Ornithology |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>

===Feeding===
[[Image:Northern Pintails (Male & Female)- Up-ending I 342.jpg|thumb|Up-ending to feed (male on right)]]
The Pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting.<ref name=Madge/> Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to 30&nbsp;centimetres (1&nbsp;ft) deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard.<ref name=Gooders/>

The winter diet is mainly plant material including seeds and [[rhizome]]s of aquatic plants, but the Pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other ''Anas'' ducks.<ref name=Gooders/>  During the nesting season, this bird eats mainly [[invertebrate]] animals, including aquatic [[insect]]s, [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s and [[crustacean]]s.<ref name=umich/>

==Health==
[[Image:Northern Pintail (Male)- Preening I IMG 1119.jpg|thumb|Male preening]]
Pintail nests and chicks are vulnerable to predation by mammals, such as [[fox]]es and [[badger]]s, and birds like [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s and [[magpie]]s. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large [[carnivore]]s such as [[bobcat]]s.<ref name= umich>{{cite web |last= Robinson |first= Jerry |coauthors= Johansson, Carl (editor) |title=''Anas acuta'' |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Anas_acuta.html |year=2002 |work=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref> Large [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], such as [[Northern Goshawk]]s, will take ducks from the ground, and some [[falcon]]s, including the [[Gyrfalcon]], have the speed and power to catch flying birds.<ref name=Forsman>{{cite book | last =Forsman | first =Dick  | title = The Raptors of Europe & the Middle East A Handbook of Field Identification | year =  2008| publisher = Princeton University Press | pages = 21<U+2013>25|isbn =0-85661-098-4 }}</ref>

Pintails in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5 million water birds, the majority being Northern Pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.<ref name= Friend/>
