'''Psittacosaurus''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02CC>|s|<U+026A>|t|<U+0259>|k|<U+0259>|<U+02C8>|s|<U+0254>r|<U+0259>|s}} {{respell|SIT|<U+0259>-k<U+0259>|SOR|<U+0259>s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for "[[parrot]] [[lizard]]") is a [[genus]] of [[psittacosaurid]] [[ceratopsia]]n [[dinosaur]] from the Early [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]] of what is now [[Asia]], about 130 to 100 [[million years ago]]. It is notable for being the most [[species]]-rich dinosaur genus. Nine to eleven  species are recognized from [[fossil]]s found in different regions of modern-day [[China]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Russia]], with a possible additional species from [[Thailand]].

All species of ''Psittacosaurus'' were [[gazelle]]-sized [[biped]]al [[herbivore]]s characterized by a high, powerful [[beak]] on the upper jaw. At least one species had long, quill-like structures on its tail and lower back, possibly serving a display function. Psittacosaurs were extremely early ceratopsians and, while they developed many novel adaptations of their own, they also shared many anatomical features with later ceratopsians, such as ''[[Protoceratops]]'' and the [[elephant]]-sized ''[[Triceratops]]''.

''Psittacosaurus'' is not as familiar to the general public as its distant relative ''Triceratops'' but it is one of the most completely known dinosaur genera. Fossils of over 400 individuals have been collected so far, including many complete skeletons. Most different age classes are represented, from [[hatchling]] through to adult, which has allowed several detailed studies of ''Psittacosaurus'' growth rates and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. The abundance of this dinosaur in the [[fossil record]] has led to its use as an [[index fossil]] for Early Cretaceous sediments of [[central Asia]].

The skull of ''Psittacosaurus'' was highly modified compared to other [[ornithischia]]n dinosaurs of its time. The skull was extremely tall in height and short in length, with an almost round [[wikt:profile|profile]] in some species. The portion in front of the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] (eye socket) was only 40% of total skull length, shorter than any other known ornithischian. The lower jaws of psittacosaurs are characterized by a bulbous vertical ridge down the center of each tooth. Both upper and lower jaws sported a pronounced beak, formed from the ''rostral'' and ''predentary'' bones, respectively. The bony core of the beak may have been sheathed in [[keratin]] to provide a sharp cutting surface for cropping [[plant]] material. As the generic name suggests, the short skull and beak superficially resembled those of modern parrots. ''Psittacosaurus'' skulls shared several adaptations with more [[derived]] ceratopsians, such as the unique rostral bone at the tip of the upper jaw, and the flared [[jugal]] (cheek) bones. However, there was still no sign of the bony neck frill or prominent facial horns which would develop in later ceratopsians.<ref name=youdodson2004>You Hailu & Dodson, Peter. (2004). Basal Ceratopsia. In: Weishampel, David B., Dodson, Peter, & Osmolska, Halszka (Eds.). ''The Dinosauria'' (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 478<U+2013>493.</ref> Bony horns did protrude from the skull of ''P. sibiricus'', but these are thought to be an example of [[convergent evolution]].<ref name=averianovetal2006/>

''Psittacosaurus'' postcranial skeletons were more typical of a 'generic' bipedal ornithischian. In ''P. mongoliensis'', similarly to other species, the forelimbs were only 58% as long as the hindlimbs and their range of motion indicates that the hands could neither be pronated nor used to generate propulsive force, suggesting that these animals were totally bipedal in life.<ref name=Senter2007>Senter, P.

Overall, the four-toed hindfoot was very similar to many other small ornithischians.<ref name=youdodson2004/>

==Taxonomy==
''Psittacosaurus'' was named in 1923 by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], [[paleontologist]] and president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] (AMNH) in a paper published on October 19. The generic name is composed of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''<U+03C8><U+03B9><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C2>''/''psittakos'' ('parrot') and ''<U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>''/''sauros'' ('lizard'), suggested by the superficially parrot-like beak of these animals and their [[reptile|reptilian]] nature.<ref name="osborn1923">Osborn, Henry F.

Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. Pp. 21<U+2013>58.</ref> This is the highest number of valid species currently assigned to any single dinosaur genus (not including [[bird]]s). In contrast, most other dinosaur genera are ''monospecific'', containing only a single known species. The difference is most likely due to quirks of the fossil record. While ''Psittacosaurus'' is known from hundreds of fossil specimens, most other dinosaur species are known from far fewer, and many are represented by only a single specimen. With a very high sample size, the diversity of ''Psittacosaurus'' can be analyzed more completely than that of most dinosaur genera, resulting in the recognition of more species. Most [[Extant taxon|extant]] animal genera are represented by multiple species, suggesting that this may have been the case for extinct dinosaur genera as well, although most of these species may not have been preserved. In addition, most dinosaurs are known solely from [[bone]]s and can only be evaluated from a [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] standpoint, whereas extant species often have very similar skeletal morphology but differ in other ways which would not normally be preserved in the fossil record, such as behavior, or coloration. Therefore actual species diversity may be much higher than currently recognized in this and other dinosaur genera.<ref name=archibald1997>Archibald, J. David. (1997). Species.

All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a [[plesiomorphy]] or primitive trait, whereas all species of ''Psittacosaurus'' had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the ''antorbital fenestra'', an opening in the skull between the eye socket and [[nostril]], was lost during the [[evolution]] of Psittacosauridae, but is still found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other [[archosaur]]s. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would [[evolution|evolve]] a second time.<ref name=youdodson2004/>

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of ''Psittacosaurus'' and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been [[cathemeral]], active throughout the day at short intervals.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmitz, L.; Motani, R. |year=2011 |title=Nocturnality in Dinosaurs Inferred from Scleral Ring and Orbit Morphology |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue= 6030|pages= 705<U+2013>8|doi=10.1126/science.1200043 |pmid=21493820}}</ref> 

===Diet===
[[File:Psittacosaurus gastroliths.jpg|thumb|''P. mongoliensis'' specimen AMNH 6254 with gastroliths in its stomach region, [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
Psittacosaurs had self-sharpening teeth that would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. However, unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths, stones swallowed to wear down food as it passed through the digestive system. Gastroliths, sometimes numbering more than fifty, are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a [[gizzard]], as in modern birds.<ref name=sereno1997/>

Unlike many other dinosaurs, psittacosaurs had akinetic skulls: the upper and lower jaws behaved as single units without internal joints. The only joint was the jaw joint itself, and psittacosaurs could slide their lower jaws forward and backward on the joint, permitting a shearing action.  Unlike most ceratopsians, their beaks did not form curved tips, but were instead rounded and flattened.  If the jaws were aligned, the beaks could be used to crop objects, but if the lower jaw was retracted so that the lower beak was inside the upper beak, the jaws may have served a nutcracking function.  A nut- or seed-rich diet would also match well with the gastroliths often seen in well-preserved psittacosaur skeletons.<ref name=serenoetal2010/>

===Growth rate===
[[File:Psittacosaurus mongoliensis juvenile.jpg|thumb|left|Skull of a juvenile ''P. mongoliensis'', AMNH]]
Several juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' have been found. The smallest is a ''P. mongoliensis'' hatchling in the AMNH collection, which is only 11 to 13&nbsp;centimeters (4<U+2013>5&nbsp;inches) long, with a skull 2.8&nbsp;centimeters (1&nbsp;in) in length. Another hatchling skull at the AMNH is only 4.6&nbsp;centimeters (1.8&nbsp;inches) long. Both specimens are from Mongolia.<ref name=coombs1982>Coombs, Walter P. (1982). Juvenile specimens of the ornithischian dinosaur ''Psittacosaurus''. ''Palaeontology'' 25: 89<U+2013>107.</ref> Juveniles discovered in the Yixian Formation are approximately the same age as the larger AMNH specimen.<ref name=mengetal2004>Meng Qingjin, Liu Jinyuan, Varrichio, David J., Huang, Timothy & Gao Chunling.

A [[histology|histological]] examination of ''P. mongoliensis'' has determined the growth rate of these animals. The smallest specimens in the study were estimated at three years old and less than 1&nbsp;kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb), while the largest were nine years old and weighed almost 20&nbsp;kilograms (44&nbsp;lb). This indicates relatively rapid growth compared to most reptiles and [[marsupial]] mammals, but slower than modern [[bird]]s and [[placental]] mammals.<ref name=erickson2000/> An [[Age determination of dinosaurs|age determination]] study performed on the [[fossil]]ized remains of ''Psittacosaurus mongoliensis'' by  using growth ring counts suggest that the longevity of the [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] ceratopsian was between 10 or 11 years.<ref name=erickson2000/>

===Integument===
{{See also|Feathered dinosaurs}}
[[File:Psittacosaurus mongoliensis.jpg|thumb|The specimen with tail integument, [[Senckenberg Museum]]]] 
The [[integument]], or body covering, of ''Psittacosaurus'' is known from a Chinese specimen, which most likely comes from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning. The specimen, which is not yet assigned to any particular species, was illegally exported from China, in violation of Chinese law, but was purchased by a [[Germany|German]] [[museum]] and arrangements are being made to return the specimen to China.<ref name=mayretal2002>Mayr, Gerald, Peters, D. Stephan, Plodowski, Gerhard & Vogel, Olaf. (2002). Bristle-like integumentary structures at the tail of the horned dinosaur ''Psittacosaurus''. ''Naturwissenschaften'' 89: 361<U+2013>365.</ref>

Most of the body was covered in [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Larger scales were arranged in irregular patterns, with numerous smaller scales occupying the spaces between them, similarly to skin impressions known from other ceratopsians, such as ''[[Chasmosaurus]]''. However, a series of what appear to be hollow, tubular bristles, approximately 16&nbsp;centimeters (6.4&nbsp;in) long, were also preserved, arranged in a row down the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] (upper) surface of the tail. However, according to some scientists "[a]t present, there is no convincing evidence which shows these structures to be [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the structurally different <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[feather]]s and protofeathers] of [[theropod]] dinosaurs."<ref name=mayretal2002/> As the structures are only found in a single row on the tail, it is unlikely that they were used for [[thermoregulation]], but they may have been useful for [[animal communication|communication]] through some sort of display.<ref name=mayretal2002/>

===Limb function===
Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 conducted on ''Psittacosaurus neimongoliensis'' and ''Psittacosaurus mongoliensis'' concluded that the forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other ''Psittacosaurus'' species) were too short to reach the ground and could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that ''Psittacosaurus'' was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if ''Psittacosaurus'' needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands couldn't reach the mouth, ''Psittacosaurus'' could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.<ref name=Senter2007/>

===Parental care and gregariousness===
[[Image:Psittacosaurus nest.jpg|thumb|Specimen in nest with 34 juveniles]] 
An extremely well preserved specimen found in the Yixian Formation of [[Liaoning Province]], China provides some of the best evidence for parental care in dinosaurs. This specimen consists of an adult ''Psittacosaurus'' (not assigned to any particular species), which is closely associated with 34 articulated juvenile skeletons, all preserved in [[dimension|three dimensions]]. The young ''Psittacosaurus'', all approximately the same age, are intertwined in a group underneath the adult, although all 34 skulls are positioned above the mass of bodies, as they would have been in life. This suggests that the animals were alive at the time of burial, which must have been extremely rapid, perhaps due to the collapse of a [[burrow]].<ref name=mengetal2004/>
[[File:Psittacosaurus family.jpg|thumb|left|Mounted casts of an adult with juveniles]] 
The juvenile bones are very small but are well-[[endochondral ossification|ossified]]. This has been taken as evidence of extensive parental care, as the young must have been in the nest long enough for their bones to become ossified.<ref name=mengetal2004/> A separate find of a herd of six ''Psittacosaurus'' individuals killed by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence of at least two age groups from two distinct clutches. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian.<ref>Zhao, Q., Barrett, P.M., Eberth, D.A. (2007). "Social behaviour and mass mortality in the basal ceratopsian dinosaur ''Psittacosaurus'' (Early Cretaceous, People's Republic of China)". ''Palaeontology'' 50(5): 1023<U+2013>1029. doi:10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00709.x</ref> Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been [[precocial]], although this does not rule out continued parental care.<ref name=coombs1982/>

===Possible aquatic behavior===
Ford and Martin (2010) proposed that ''Psittacosaurus'' was semi-aquatic, swimming through the use of its tail similar to crocodiles, and through paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; the position of the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long [[chevron (anatomy)|chevrons]] (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of [[gastroliths]], interpreted as ballast.  They further suggested that some species of ''Psittacosaurus'' were more terrestrial than others.<ref name=fordmartin2010>{{Cite book |last=Ford |first=Tracy L. |coauthor=and Martin, Larry D. |year=2010 |chapter=A semi-aquatic life habit for ''Psittacosaurus''  |editors=Ryan, Michael J.;  Chinnery-Allgeier, Brenda J.; and Eberth, David A.

===Predation===
[[File:Repenomamus with stomach contents.jpg|thumb|The ''Repenomamus robustus'' specimen with ''Psittacosaurus'' remains in its stomach]]
Another fossil from the Yixian Formation provides direct evidence of ''Psittacosaurus'' as a [[prey]] animal. One skeleton of ''[[Repenomamus|Repenomamus robustus]]'', a large [[triconodont]] mammal, is preserved with the remains of a juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the [[carnivore|carnivorous]] mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in that it is the first known example of [[Mesozoic]] mammals preying on live dinosaurs.<ref name=huetal2005>Hu Yaoming, Meng Jin, Wang Yuanqing & Li Chuankui. (2005). Large Mesozoic mammals fed on dinosaurs. ''Nature'' 433: 149<U+2013>152.</ref> Heavy predation on juvenile ''Psittacosaurus'' may have resulted in [[R/K selection theory|R-selection]], the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.

===Pathology===
Out of over 400 known ''Psittacosaurus'' specimens, only one has been published with any sort of [[pathology]]. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to ''P. mongoliensis'', was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation of China. There is no sign of a [[bone fracture]], but very clear signs of an [[infection]] can be seen near the midpoint of the right [[fibula]]. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of [[necrosis]] due to a lack of [[blood]] supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a [[weight bearing]] bone in the leg would likely have been fatal. However, unlike the [[femur]] and [[tibia]], the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.<ref name=luetal2007/>
