'''''Midtown Madness''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] [[video game]] developed for [[Windows]] by [[Angel Studios (San Diego)|Angel Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft]]. A [[game demo|demo version]] was released via download on May 1, 1999, and the entire game was released on May 27, 1999. A sequel, ''[[Midtown Madness 2]]'', was released in 2000. Set in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the goal of ''Midtown Madness'' is to win [[street racing|street races]] and obtain new cars.

Unlike many racing games, which restrict the player to a race track, ''Midtown Madness'' offers an [[open world (video games)|open world]] recreation of Chicago. This setting was developed by Microsoft and described as offering "an unprecedented degree of freedom to drive around in a virtual city".<ref name=IGNInt1 /> Players can explore the city via one of several modes, and can determine the weather and traffic conditions for each race. The game supports [[multiplayer]] races over a [[local area network]] or the Internet. Overall, the game received positive reviews from gaming websites;<ref name=GameRankings/><ref name=MobyRank/> reviewers generally praised the gameplay, though some criticized the graphics.

==Gameplay==
''Midtown Madness'' features four single-player modes: Blitz, Circuit, Checkpoint, and Cruise. In Blitz, the player must reach a destination within a time limit; in Circuit, the player races other vehicles; in Checkpoint, the game adds the complication of other traffic, such as police cars and pedestrians; and in Cruise, the player simply explores the city.  Players have a choice of up to ten vehicles, although only five are available at the start. To unlock the other cars, players must achieve goals such as winning a certain number of races.<ref name=AllgameO /><ref name=IGNprev>Trent C.

The city is modeled after Chicago, including many of its landmarks, such as the "[[Chicago 'L'|El-Train]]", [[Sears Tower]], [[Wrigley Field]], and [[Soldier Field]].<ref name=FSprev1>Bob Colayco (April 2, 1999) [http://www.firingsquad.com/games/mtmpreview/default.asp Chi-town].

Accessed June 20, 2008.</ref> Its streets feature many objects that the player can crash into, such as bins, parking meters, mailboxes, and street lights.<ref name=FSprev1/> In Checkpoint, traffic is regulated by traffic lights, but the player is under no obligation to obey them. 

''Midtown Madness'' supports multiplayer games via local area network, Internet, or [[serial cable]] connection. Multiplayer mode was originally supported by Microsoft's [[MSN Gaming Zone]], though this service was retired on June 19, 2006.<ref>[http://zone.msn.com/en/general/article/midtretiring.htm Midtown Madness and Motocross Madness matchmaking has been retired on MSN Games&nbsp;<U+2013> thank you so much for playing!] (June 19, 2006).

Accessed June 21, 2008.</ref> Multiplayer includes a Cops and Robbers mode, inspired by the television program ''World's Deadliest Police Chases''. This is a [[capture the flag]]-style game in which players form two teams; each team must steal the opposing team's cache of gold and return it to their own hideout.<ref name=PCGpreview />

==Development==
''Midtown Madness'' was one of the first games that Angel Studios (now [[Rockstar San Diego]], part of [[Rockstar Games]]) developed for the PC.<ref name=IGNInt1 /> Microsoft was following up on their previous ''Madness'' computer games, ''[[Motocross Madness]]'' and ''[[Monster Truck Madness]]''. According to project director Clint Keith, the idea behind the game came to two Microsoft employees while they were "trying to cross a busy Paris street".<ref name=PCGpreview /> They proposed their idea to Angel Studios, who were attempting to sell Microsoft a [[3D computer graphics|3D vehicle simulator]]. Angel Studios were initially hesitant to accept Microsoft's offer, as it "seemed too large a challenge to pull off".<ref name=PCGpreview /> After agreeing, Angel Studios chose Chicago for the setting because it is the site of several famous car chases, such as those in the films ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[The Blues Brothers]]''. To ensure that the city was recreated faithfully, Angel Studios had Chicago residents [[Game tester|playtest]] the game. ''[[PC Gamer]]'' reported a consensus that the recreation was mostly accurate, though Angel Studios had relocated landmarks to enhance the gameplay.<ref name=PCGpreview>[[Gary Whitta]] (March 1999). "Scoop! Midtown Madness". ''[[PC Gamer]]''. pp. 34&ndash;35.</ref>

Angel Studios and Microsoft included ordinary cars in addition to the "overpowered Italian sports cars" often seen in racing games.<ref name=IGNDriversFound /> The developers had to obtain permission from manufacturers to use the likenesses of the vehicles; Microsoft thus received permission from [[Volkswagen]] for the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]] and from [[Ford]] for the [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] and [[Ford F350|F-350]].<ref name=PCGpreview /><ref name=IGNDriversFound>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/067/067180p1.html Drivers Found] (March 4, 1999). [[IGN]]. Accessed June 19, 2008.</ref> The decision to make only half the cars available at the outset was to promote a "spirit of competitiveness".<ref name=sports /> Microsoft also told Angel Studios not to allow players to hit pedestrians. After deciding against rendering pedestrians in two dimensions, Angel Studios developed 3D pedestrian models that could run and jump out of the way. Angel Studios included an option to remove pedestrians, as they do not alter gameplay but may significantly affect system performance when in a group; consequently, the game does not require a 3D [[graphics card]].<ref name=PCGpreview />

The game is distinctly different from other racing games<U+2014>[[IGN]] noted the difference from the ''[[Need for Speed]]'' series<U+2014>because of what Microsoft called "an unprecedented degree of freedom to drive around in a virtual city."<ref name=IGNInt1>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/067/067312p1.html Pedal to the Metal] (January 26, 1999). [[IGN]]. Accessed June 19, 2008.</ref> Clint Keith said the idea behind an "open space" game was to make the gameplay more diverse, and to add an "element of discovery", such as the shortcuts players can take to reach the finish line first.<ref name=IGNInt1 /> Whitta described the game as open racing: "you still have checkpoints to hit ...[but] you don't have to follow the A-B-C-D standard to do it".<ref name=PCGpreview />

Reviews of the game were generally positive. IGN rated the game's appearance highly, noting that overall "the downtown portion of Chicago is portrayed very accurately", though generic-looking portions of the city were criticized.<ref name=IGNreview /> GameSpot approved of the variety in third-person, first-person dashboard, and widescreen driving views. However, it complained of the game suffering from "choppy [[frame rate]]s" and unconvincing [[visual effects]].<ref name=GSpotreview /> ''PC Zone'' praised Angel Studios for avoiding gimmicks, instead presenting "accurately modelled cars and a meticulously recreated city" to the player.<ref name=PCZreview /> Allgame said ''Midtown Madness'' "possesses superb, immersive graphics", using the different times of day and weather as an example. However, it complained that cars not controlled by the player were lacking in details.<ref name=Allgame /> ''Computer and Video Games'' said that as well as being "structurally and visually consistent", the Chicago setting in ''Midtown Madness'' was "brought to life"<U+2014>for instance, a "city bus legitimately pulling out at a four-way junction" can end the race for a player by destroying their car.<ref name=CVGreview /> However, Total Video Games called the game's presentation "far from optimal" even at the recommended [[system requirements]]. Reviewer Noel Brady pointed out a "a serious lack of detail" and blockiness, especially without a graphics card.<ref name=TVG />

[[Image:Midtown madness screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|A heavily damaged [[Cadillac Eldorado]] hitting oncoming traffic while being pursued by a [[police car]]. Moments like this earned the game praise for making it "fun to be able to drive like a maniac...because you know you can't in real life."<ref name=GSpotreview />]]
IGN described the in-game narration as "a nice touch", but noted some [[glitch]]es among the otherwise "distinctive engine and horn sounds".<ref name=IGNreview /> GameSpot called the game's sounds exceptional, approving of its variety of car noises such as the "warning beeps when the bus goes in reverse".<ref name=GSpotreview /> ''PC Zone'' praised the in-game radio system, and the support for external media players.<ref name=PCZreview /> Allgame said players "get a dose of reality" with other drivers and pedestrians "hurling insults and exclamations your way".<ref name=Allgame /> Total Video Games was critical of the [[AI]], declaring that cars often drive "without noticing [the player] at all".<Ref name=TVG /> In his book ''AI Game Engine Programming'', Brian Schwab described ''Midtown Madness''{{'}} gameplay as "arcade style" and "fast and loose", and said the in-game traffic was great.<ref>Brian Schwab (2004). [http://books.google.com/books?id=mDcRYavIn2MC&pg=PA183&as_brr=3&sig=ACfU3U0hlcrwWlxY8J_hZ1n3dJ_MseXnTA#PPA183,M1  ''AI Game Engine Programming'']. Charles River Media. p. 183.</ref>

Reviews of ''Midtown Madness'' attributed the most praise to its gameplay or "fun" elements. IGN wrote that the game "doesn't rely heavily on driving authenticity; this game's all about fun." The review also praised the simplicity whereby players can "pick a real-world car and go".<ref name=IGNreview /> GameSpot wrote that "it's fun to be able to drive like a maniac...because you know you can't in real life."<ref name=GSpotreview />  ''Computer and Video Games'' remarked on the game's humor, provided by other drivers, police, contenders (described as maniacs), and the "carnage that unfolds before your windscreen".<ref name=CVGreview /> ''PC Zone'' recommended the game, calling it highly refreshing; Total Video Games said the game seemed a good choice, but suggested that it would be outdone by [[GT Interactive]]'s ''[[Driver (video game)|Driver]]'', released soon after.<ref name=TVG /> Allgame called it a "must-buy for the driving game enthusiast", and argued that it would appeal to those not otherwise fans of the genre.<ref name=Allgame />
