In [[medicine]], '''ovarian vein syndrome''' is a rare condition in which a dilated [[ovarian vein]] compresses the [[ureter]] (the tube that brings the [[urine]] from the [[kidney]] to the [[bladder]]). This causes chronic or [[colic|colicky]] [[abdominal pain]], [[back pain]] and/or [[pelvic pain]]. The pain can worsen on lying down or between ovulation and menstruation.<ref name="pmid12379831">{{cite journal |author=Tourn<U+00E9> G, Ducroux A, Bourbon M, Blinding H |title=The ovarian vein syndrome: eight cases and review of the literature |language=French |journal=J Gynecol Obstet Biol Reprod (Paris) |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=471<U+2013>7 |year=2002 |month=September |pmid=12379831 |doi= |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-JGYN-09-2002-31-5-0368-2315-101019-ART5}}</ref><ref name="pmid16703736">{{cite journal |author=del Valle Gonz<U+00E1>lez N, Est<U+00E9>banez Zarranz J, Escudero Caro T, ''et al'' |title=[http://www.actasurologicas.info/v30/n01/ENG/3001NC03.htm Laparoscopic treatment of ovarian vein syndrome] |language=Spanish; Castilian |journal=Actas Urol Esp |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=85<U+2013>9 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16703736 |doi= |url=}}</ref> There can also be an increased tendency towards [[urinary tract infection]] or [[pyelonephritis]] (kidney infection). The right ovarian vein is most commonly involved, although the disease can be left-sided or affect both sides. It is currently classified as a form of [[pelvic congestion syndrome]].

Since it is a rare disease, it remains a [[diagnosis of exclusion]] of other conditions with similar symptoms. The diagnosis is supported by the results of imaging studies such as [[computed tomography]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging]], [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the abdomen (with or without [[doppler imaging]]) or [[intravenous urography]].

Treatment consists of [[painkillers]] and surgical ablation of the dilated vein. This can be accomplished with open abdominal surgery ([[laparotomy]]) or keyhole surgery ([[laparoscopy]]).<ref name="pmid8808882">{{cite journal |author=Elashry OM, Nakada SY, Wolf JS, Figenshau RS, McDougall EM, Clayman RV |title=Ureterolysis for extrinsic ureteral obstruction: a comparison of laparoscopic and open surgical techniques |journal=J.

==Disease mechanism==
Normally, the ovarian vein crosses over the ureter at the level of the fourth or fifth lumbar [[Vertebra|vertebral bone]]. The ureter itself courses over the [[external iliac artery]] and [[external iliac vein|vein]].<ref name="pmid9113150">{{cite journal |author=Maubon A, Ferru JM, Thiebaut C, Berger V, Hoche N, Rouanet JP |title=Left ovarian vein syndrome |language=French |journal=J Radiol |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=223<U+2013>5 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9113150 |doi= |url=http://www.masson.fr/masson/MDOI-JR-03-1997-78-3-0221-0363-101019-ART59}}</ref> Thus, these vessels can impinge on the ureter causing obstruction. The left ovarian vein ends in the [[renal vein]] whereas the right ovarian vein normally enters into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In the case of right ovarian veine syndrome, the vein often ends in the renal vein. This is thought to contribute to venous engorgement, in analogy to what is seen in [[varicocele]]s, which arise more commonly on the left side. The straigth angle between the ovarian vein (or testicular vein in males in the case of varicocoele) and the renal vein has been proposed as a cause of decreased blood return.

The ovarian vein often displays incompetent valves. This has been observed more often in women with a higher number of previous [[pregnancies]]. Pressure from the baby might hinder the return of blood through the ovarian vein. It has to be noted however that dilation of the [[urinary tract]] is a normal observation in pregnancy, due to mechanical compression and the hormonal action of [[progesterone]]. Ovarian vein dilatation might also follow [[venous thrombosis]] (clotting inside the vein).

Another proposed mechanism of obstruction is when the ovarian vein and ureter both run through a sheath of [[fibrosis|fibrous]] tissue, following a local [[inflammation]]. This could be seen as a localised form of [[retroperitoneal fibrosis]].<ref name="pmid9113150"/>

Following obstruction, the ureter displays an abnormal [[peristalsis]] (contractions) towards the kidney instead of towards the bladder. This is thought to cause the colicky pain (similar to [[renal colic]]), and it is relieved after surgical decompression.
