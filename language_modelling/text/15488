'''Cao Cao's invasion of Xu Province''' was a punitive invasion launched by the warlord [[Cao Cao]] against [[Tao Qian (Han Dynasty)|Tao Qian]], Governor of Xu Province (<U+5F90><U+5DDE>; covering present-day [[Jiangsu]]), during the [[End of the Han Dynasty|prelude]] to the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. The goal of the invasion was to punish Tao Qian for what Cao Cao saw as Tao's responsibility in the murder of Cao's father, [[Cao Song]]. The invasion took place in two separate waves in 193 and 194, during each of which Cao Cao captured a number of towns and engaged in collective punishment of the civilian populace.

==Background==
===The death of Cao Song===
Cao Cao's father Cao Song was fleeing from the turmoil consuming the capital regions following the fall of [[Dong Zhuo]] at the end of the Han Dynasty. A former high ranking government official, Cao Song was very wealthy, and had brought with him a baggage train cosisting of more than 100 covered carts full of his effects.<ref name=sgz_11>{{cite book|author=Chen Shou|authorlink=Chen Shou|editor=Pei Songzhi|editor-link=Pei Songzhi|trans_title=[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]|title=<U+4E09><U+570B><U+5FD7>|publisher=Dingwen Printing|origyear=280|chapter=<U+5377> 1: <U+6B66><U+5E1D><U+64CD>|place=Taibei|year=1977|page=11}}</ref><ref name=zztj_1945>{{cite book|editor=Sima Guang|editor-link=Sima Guang|title=<U+8CC7><U+6CBB><U+901A><U+9452>|trans_title=[[Zizhi Tongjian]]|origyear=1084|location=Beijing|publisher=Zhonghua Publishing House|year=1956|chapter=60: <U+6F22><U+7D00><U+4E94><U+5341><U+4E8C>|page=1945}}</ref> In or near Hua County (near [[Mount Tai]]), Cao Song and his son Cao De (<U+66F9><U+5FB7>) were ambushed and killed.

===Tao Qian's responsibility===
Accounts of the degree of Tao Qian's responsiblity in the murder of Cao Song differ.

According to the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'' and ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', Tao Qian had garrisoned men nearby at Yinping, who were tempted by greed for Cao Song's riches and murdered him for his wealth en route to his destination of Langye (<U+7405><U+90AA>; present-day [[Linyi]], [[Shandong]]).<ref name=hhs_2367>{{cite book|editor=Fan Ye|editor-link=Fan Ye|title=<U+5F8C><U+6F22><U+66F8>|trans_title=[[Book of the Later Han]]|origyear=445|location=Beijing|publisher=Zhonghua Publishing House|year=1965|chapter=<U+5377> 73: <U+9676><U+8B19><U+5217><U+50B3>|page=2367}}</ref><ref name=zztj_1945 />

The main text of the ''[[Records of Three Kingdoms]]'' makes no specific note of Tao Qian's involvement in Cao Song's murder, but [[Pei Songzhi]]'s annotations mention two other accounts from two other sources now lost. According to [[Wei Zhao (Three Kingdoms)|Wei Zhao]]'s ''Book of Wu'', Tao Qian despatched 200 bodyguards led by Commandant of the Capital [[Zhang Kai (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Kai]] to escort Cao Song, but Zhang instead murdered Cao and made off with his riches. The ''Accounts of the Wei and Jin Dynasties'' (<U+9B4F><U+6649><U+4E16><U+8A9E>) claim that Cao Cao ordered the Administrator of Mount Tai, [[Ying Shao]], to escort Cao Song's entourage to safety. Before Ying Shao could arrive, Tao Qian ordered several thousand riders to attack Cao Song instead. Cao Song, expecting an escort rather than a sneak attack, was thus taken completely by surprise.<ref name=sgz_11 />

All sources agree that whatever Tao Qian's degree of involvement, Cao Cao intended to hold him accountable.

==The first invasion==
In the summer or autumn<ref>''Book of the Later Han'' (volume 73, p. 2367), followed by the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' (volume 60, p. 1945) have "autumn", while the ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' (volume 1, p. 11) has "summer". The secondary source ''History of Chinese Warfare'' specifies "the sixth month" (volume 4, p. 67), which would have been around August.</ref> of 193, Cao Cao invaded Xu Province with an unspecified number of troops and easily captured over ten cities.<ref name=sgz_249>{{cite book|author=Chen Shou|authorlink=Chen Shou|editor=Pei Songzhi|editor-link=Pei Songzhi|trans_title=[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]|title=<U+4E09><U+570B><U+5FD7>|publisher=Dingwen Printing|origyear=280|chapter= <U+5377> 8: <U+9676><U+8B19>|place=Taibei|year=1977|page=249}}</ref><ref name=zztj_1945 /><ref name=zgzzs_67>{{cite book|author1=Wu Guoqing|author2=Mu Zhongyue|trans_title=History of Chinese Warfare|title=<U+4E2D><U+570B><U+6230><U+722D><U+53F2>|publisher=Gold Wall Press|place=Beijing|volume=4|page=67}}</ref> Arriving at Tao Qian's capital of Pengcheng (present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]), Cao Cao conquered it, killing possibly more than 10,000 defenders.<ref>This casualty statistic, which appears in Tao Qian's biography in ''Records of Three Kingdoms'' (volume 8, p. 249), is attached to a phrase describing the [[Si River]] being dammed with the bodies of the dead. According to [[Rafe de Crespigny]] (''[https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/peace1_part3.pdf To Establish Peace]'', volume 1, internet edition (2004), p. 68 note 24 [internet pagination]), this is unsupported by geography and probably happened during Cao Cao's massacre of civilians somewhat farther south, not during his battle at Pengcheng. Thus, the casualty figure is most probably not reliable.</ref> Tao Qian fled to [[Tancheng County|Tancheng]], which Cao Cao assaulted unsuccessfully.

Thwarted and low on rations<ref name=sgz_249 />, Cao Cao turned his army around, sacking in the process the counties of Qiul<U+00FC> (<U+53D6><U+616E>), Suiling (<U+7762><U+9675>), and Xiaqiu (<U+590F><U+4E18>).<ref>The ''Book of the Later Han'' (volume 73, p. 2367) also includes amongst Cao Cao's ravages Pengcheng and Fuyang (<U+5085><U+967D>), in present-day Linyi, Shandong.</ref> The local population was swollen with refugees from the violence of the capital regions. Cao Cao's army killed over 100,000 civilians, including both men and women, such that the [[Si River]] was stoppered up with their corpses. His army took the chickens and dogs for food and tore down the villages into ruins. No one returned: Tao Qian's people were annihilated.<ref name=hhs_2367 /><ref name=zztj_1945 /><ref name=zgzzs_67 />  

==The second invasion==
In the spring of 194, Cao Cao's army returned to Xu Province, and Tao Qian begged aid from [[Tian Kai]] in the nearby Qing Province (<U+9752><U+5DDE>). Tian Kai sent Tao Qian a force of some thousand men commanded by [[Liu Bei]]. Tao Qian, seeking to open a southern front against Cao Cao,<ref>{{cite book|last=de Crespigny|first=Rafe|authorlink=Rafe de Crespigny|title=To Establish Peace|volume=1|edition=internet|publisher=Australian National University Faculty of Asian Studies|year=2004|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/html/1885/42048/peace1_part4.pdf|page=13 note 6}}</ref> appointed Liu Bei Inspector of [[Yuzhou (nine ancient provinces)|Yu Province]], and transferred 4,000 soldiers into his service.<ref>''Zizhi Tongjian'', volume 61, p. 1949</ref><ref name=zgzzs_68>''History of Chinese Warfare'' volume 4, p. 68</ref> Along with Tao Qian's general [[Cao Bao (Han Dynasty)|Cao Bao]], Liu Bei encamped east of the city of Tancheng.<ref name=sgz_11 />

Cao Cao's army plundered Langye and Donghai (<U+6771><U+6D77>; near present-day [[Tancheng County|Tancheng]], Shandong), destroying all in its path.<ref name=sgz_11 /><ref name=zztj_1950>''Zizhi Tongjian'', volume 61, p. 1950</ref><ref name=zgzzs_68 /> Returning west, Cao Cao engaged and defeated Tao Qian's forces led by Liu Bei.<ref name=sgz_11 /><ref name=zztj_1950 /> According to one account, Cao Cao conquered the nearby city of Xiangfen (<U+8944><U+8CC1>) after this.<ref name=sgz_11 />

Xu Province was only granted reprieve when [[Zhang Miao]] betrayed Cao Cao and invited [[L<U+00FC> Bu]] to take over Cao Cao's home base of Yan Province (<U+5157><U+5DDE>).<ref>''Book of the Later Han'', volume 73 p. 2368</ref> Cao Cao broke off his misplaced vengeance against Tao Qian and turned his army back to attack L<U+00FC> Bu.

==Aftermath==
Tao Qian's magnanimity towards Liu Bei shifted the latter's alliance from Tian Kai, and after Cao Cao left Xu Province Liu Bei remained. Such were his connections that when Tao Qian died of illness later in 194, his sons Tao Shang (<U+9676><U+5546>) and Tao Ying (<U+9676><U+61C9>) were passed over for governorship by the local elite in favour of Liu Bei. Thus Liu Bei gained his first territory as a result of Cao Cao's campaign.

==Modern references==
Cao Cao's invasion of Xu Province is featured as playable stages in the [[Dynasty Warriors 7|seventh]] installment of [[Koei]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' video game series.
