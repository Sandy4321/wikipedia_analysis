'''Alou Diarra''' ({{IPA-fr|alu dja<U+0281>a}}) (born 15 July 1981) is a [[France|French]] [[Association football|football]] player of [[Mali]]an ancestry who currently plays for French club [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. He primarily plays as a [[Midfielder|defensive midfielder]], but can also deputized as a [[Defender (football)|centre back]] if necessary. Diarra is described as a player who is "strong, athletic and very powerful" and possesses a "combative edge" similar to former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Patrick Vieira]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jan/05/newsstory.sport4 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | title = Wenger weighs up <U+00A3>5m move for Liverpool cast-off Diarra |date = 5 January 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}</ref> Diarra is also known for his leadership ability and has served as captain of both Bordeaux domestically and [[France national football team|France]] internationally.

Diarra began his career playing for clubs based in [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], such as CSL Aulnay and hometown club FC Villepinte. In 1997, he joined [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux|Louhans-Cuiseaux]] and made his professional debut with the club in the [[1999<U+2013>2000 French Division 2|1999<U+2013>2000 season]] while the club was playing in the [[Ligue 2|second division]]. In 2000, Diarra was recruited by [[Germany|German]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He spent two years playing on the club's reserve team, [[Bayern Munich II]], and spent the second half of his second year with Bayern playing on loan at [[SC Freiburg|Freiburg]]. In 2002, he was signed by compatriot [[G<U+00E9>rard Houllier]] as part of the manager's ''French Revolution'' to play for [[England|English]] club [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]]. Diarra's stint at the club was deemed a disappointment as he spent both years at the club on loan in France playing for [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], [[SC Bastia|Bastia]], and [[RC Lens|Lens]]. 

After a successful 2004<U+2013>05 season with Lens, Diarra made a permanent return to France joining the club from Liverpool on a permanent deal. He spent two seasons at the club amassing over 70 appearances before signing with the then five-team defending champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. At Lyon, Diarra struggled for playing time and left the club to join [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] after one year. He did earn a winner's medal as a result of the club winning the [[2006<U+2013>07 Ligue 1]] title. With Bordeaux, Diarra was ever-present within the team under manager [[Laurent Blanc]]. He was a prominent figure on the Bordeaux team that won the [[The double|league and league cup double]] in the [[2008<U+2013>09 Ligue 1|2008<U+2013>09 season]]. Diarra has also won two [[Troph<U+00E9>e des champions]] while playing for the club.

Diarra is also a [[France national football team|France international]]. Prior to playing at senior level, he played at [[France national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. With the under-20 team, Diarra played on the team that participated in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. He made his senior international debut in October 2004 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Diarra has participated in both the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]]. In the 2006 competition, he appeared in a group stage match against [[Togo national football team|Togo]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|the final match]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] as a substitute. In the 2010 edition, Diarra captained France for the first time in the team's final group stage match against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Diarra was born in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Villepinte]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] to [[Mali]]an parents.<ref name="alou_career">{{cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/111685/alou-diarra-le-perseverant/ | publisher = [[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = Alou Diarra, le pers<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>rant |date = 20 May 2010 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> He has a younger brother, Zank<U+00E9>, who also plays football. The younger Diarra currently plays for the [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] of professional club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. Both brothers were raised in the nearby commune of [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]] and began their football careers at hometown club CSL Aulnay.<ref name="alou_career"/> After six years in Aulnay, Diarra moved back to his birth city to join FC Villepinte. While in the youth academy of Villepinte, he struggled to attract the attention of professional clubs often personally contacting clubs in order to earn [[Trial (sport)|trials]]. Diarra was ultimately denied several opportunities, most notably by [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]] and, according to his brother, the struggle made the elder Diarra "very motivated to succeed".<ref name="alou_career"/><ref name="alou_career2">{{cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/131388/diarra-juste-quelqu-un-de-bien/ | publisher = [[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = Diarra, juste quelqu<U+2019>un de bien<U+2026> |date = 20 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref>

In 1997, Diarra was signed to an amateur contract by professional club [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux]] who were playing in [[Ligue 2]], the second level of [[Football in France|French football]], and was inserted into the club's youth academy. In the 1998<U+2013>99 season, Diarra was promoted to the club's reserve team and spent two seasons playing there. In the latter part of the [[1999<U+2013>2000 French Division 2|1999<U+2013>2000 season]], he was called up to the senior team by [[Coach (sport)|manager]] [[Philippe Hinschberger]]. On 15 April 2000, Diarra made his professional debut in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] picking up a [[Penalty card|yellow card]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45708 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Louhans-Cuiseaux v. Toulouse Match Report |date = 15 April 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> Two weeks later, he made his first professional start in the team's 3<U+2013>2 loss to [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45660 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Louhans-Cuiseaux v. Niort Match Report |date = 29 April 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> In his final appearance with Louhans-Cuiseaux, Diarra received his first red card of his career after incurring two yellow card infractions in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45660 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Le Mans v. Louhans-Cuiseaux Match Report |date = 5 May 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> Louhans-Cuiseaux finished the campaign in last place and were relegated to the semi-professional [[Championnat National]], the third division of French football. After the season, Louhans-Cuiseaux attempted to tie down Diarra on a long-term deal and offered the player a trainee contract. Diarra refused the deal and was subsequently available to sign with any club on a [[free transfer]].<ref name="alou_contract">{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/media-watch/diarra-in-french-dispute | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra in French dispute  |date = 20 September 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref>

=== Germany and England ===
During the summer of 2000, Diarra was signed by [[Germany|German]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after the club saw him play one match with Louhans-Cuiseaux.<ref name="alou_career2"/> Upon his arrival to the club, he was immediately placed onto the club's reserve team, [[Bayern Munich II]], in the [[Regionalliga S<U+00FC>d]], the fourth level of [[Football in Germany|German football]]. Diarra was a regular within the team playing alongside the likes of [[Owen Hargreaves]], [[Philip Lahm]], [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], and [[Zvjezdan Misimovi<U+0107>]].<ref name="alou_bayern">{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000028/match=2000396/prematch/focus/index.html | publisher = [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Diarra keeping plenty in reserve for Bayern |date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}</ref> In his first season with the reserve team, he appeared in 28 matches scoring four goals. Diarra's influence in the team was immediate as he scored his first goal for the team in the first league match of the season against [[VfR Mannheim]] in 4<U+2013>2 defeat.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/regionalliga/sued/2001/1/bayernii-vfrmannheim/ | publisher = Fussballdaten | title = Spielstatistik FC Bayern M<U+00FC>nchen II - VfR Mannheim |date = 30 July 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = German}}</ref> His combative style of play also began to take shape as he collected nine yellow cards during the campaign with seven of them coming in the team's first 17 matches. The season was ultimately a success for Diarra partly due to the player being promoted to the senior team for the [[2001<U+2013>02 Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|2001<U+2013>02 season]] by manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]]. He was assigned the number 30 shirt.

Diarra began the 2001<U+2013>02 season by making the bench in several of the team's league matches in August and September, but failing to make an appearance. In October 2001, he was dropped back down to the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning promotion back to the senior team for its [[2001 Intercontinental Cup]] showdown with [[Argentina|Argentine]] club [[Boca Juniors]]. Diarra made the bench for the match, but did not feature as Bayern won the match courtesy of an extra time goal from [[Samuel Kuffour]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=510885.html#toyota+cup+2001 | publisher = [[FIFA|F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association]] | title = Toyota Cup 2001 |date = 27 November 2001 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> The victory gave Diarra his first major honour of his career. In January 2002, he was sent on loan to fellow first division club [[SC Freiburg]] in order to receive some significant playing time. Diarra, however, failed to make an appearance for the club and returned to Bayern in March to play with the reserve team where he made nine more appearances. Following the season, Diarra was offered a new three-year contract with the club, but rejected it citing his limited playing time.<ref name="alou_liverpool">{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-11-useless-facts-you-must-know | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra: 11 useless facts you must know!  |date = 10 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> Despite his disappointing stint with Bayern, which included failing to make an appearance with the club's senior team, in 2009, Diarra stated "I have very fond memories of my time in Bayern".<ref name="alou_bayern"/> Following Diarra's success at [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], Bayern's general manager [[Uli Hoene<U+00DF>]] admitted that Diarra's rise to prominence as a footballer is "one of the seven wonders of the world". Hoene<U+00DF> admitted that he was surprised by Diarra's resurgence stating "If somebody had told me [he would return for a UEFA Champions League game] five years ago and made a bet with me, I would have lost a fortune".<ref name="alou_bayern"/>

On 3 July 2002, [[England|English]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] confirmed its interest in signing Diarra under the guidance of manager [[G<U+00E9>rard Houllier]] who had likened the player to [[Patrick Vieira]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/liverpool-confirm-interest-in-diarra | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Liverpool confirm interest in Diarra  |date = 3 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> Liverpool were also in competition with [[Italy|Italian]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and several French clubs.<ref name="alou_liverpool"/> On 9 July, Liverpool confirmed that the club had signed the player from Bayern Munich. Diarra agreed to a five-year contract and made his club debut against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] during the club's pre-season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/houllier-swoops-for-midfielder | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Houllier swoops for midfielder   |date = 9 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-makes-reds-debut | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra makes Reds debut  |date = 19 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> A day after the match against Le Havre, it was reported that Diarra was on a verge of a loan move to the same club.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-loan-move-a-possibility | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra loan move a possibility  |date = 20 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> On 1 August, the loan was confirmed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-loan-deal-done | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra loan deal done  |date = 1 August 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref>

;Loan stints in France

Diarra made his debut for Le Havre on 17 August 2002 in the team's 1<U+2013>1 draw with [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] appearing as a substitute.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/47521 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Strasbourg v. Le Havre Match Report |date = 17 August 2002 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> He was a frequent starter for the majority of the fall season, but, following the winter break, began appearing primarily as a substitute. In September 2002, Diarra's contract dispute with Louhan-Cuiseaux came into the spotlight after his former club admitted that the player was reportedly banned from playing in France professionally for three years due to moving abroad without Louhans-Cuiseaux receiving a trainers' compensation fee.<ref name="alou_contract"/> Louhans-Cuiseaux reported the situation to [[FIFA]], however, the organization ruled in favor of Diarra who was allowed to continue his career with Le Havre. Diarra scored his first professional goal on 25 January 2003 in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to [[Stade Lavallois|Laval]] in the [[Coupe de France]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-on-target-for-le-havre | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra on target for Le Havre |date = 26 January 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> He finished the campaign with 28 total appearances.

In the 2003 off-season, Diarra admitted that he would love to return to Liverpool stating "I'm someone who is ambitious and I hope to win my place at Anfield next season".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-hoping-for-anfield-return | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra hoping for Anfield return |date = 19 June 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> However, in July 2003, Houllier confirmed that Diarra would remain in France on loan, this time with [[Corsica]]n club [[SC Bastia|Bastia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-set-for-another-loan-spell | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra set for another loan spell  |date = 15 June 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> Upon his arrival to the club, Diarra was inserted as a starter by manager [[G<U+00E9>rard Gili]] and paid immediate dividends scoring in back-to-back weeks in a 4<U+2013>2 win against [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] and a 4<U+2013>1 loss to [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in September.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48102 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bastia v.

After the season, Diarra returned to Liverpool for pre-season training, however, not under the guidance of his recruiter Houllier, but under [[Spain|Spanish]] coach [[Rafael Ben<U+00ED>tez]]. As a result, he was, for the third consecutive season, linked with a loan move.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/media-watch/lens-eye-diarra-loan-move | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Lens eye Diarra loan move  |date = 23 July 2004 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> His non-inclusion on the club's roster for its [[North America]] tour meant a loan move was inevitably and, on 27 July 2004, he was loaned to [[RC Lens|Lens]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-set-to-go-out-on-loan-again | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra set to go out on loan again |date = 27 July 2004 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}</ref> 

Similar to his stint at Bastia, Diarra was included in the team as a starter by coach [[Jo<U+00EB>l Muller]]. The season was a major success for Diarra as he was the only player in the team to start every league match he played for the club. He also served as captain for a majority of the season. His consistent performances led to his call up to the senior national team. Diarra scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1<U+2013>1 draw with [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]]. He scored the goal in the opening minute of the match.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48934 | publisher = [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lens v.

Diarra also collected 11 yellow cards.

=== Return to France ===
After establishing himself as a premier player in France and an international during the 2004<U+2013>05 campaign, Ben<U+00ED>tez declared that Diarra still had a future at Liverpool stating "I think it's still early days for him, but it's good news for us to see a young player doing so well. If he continues to play well for his club and is in the national team, we will be reminding everyone he is our player".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/rafa-diarra-can-have-a-future-here | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Rafa: Diarra can have a future here   |date = 14 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref> However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-i-want-to-stay-at-lens | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra: I want to stay at Lens  |date = 19 April 2005 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref> After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be [[Euro|<U+20AC>]]3.2 million.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lens-agree-terms-for-diarra | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Lens agree terms for Diarra  |date = 24 June 2005 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref> Diarra finished his Liverpool career with no first-team appearances and only one club appearance, which came in a pre-season friendly.

Diarra remained a starter at Lens and also retained his consistency appearing in a career-high 44 matches, scoring two goals, and providing four assists.

Following the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Diarra was linked with a move to the then five-team defending champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] where he could reunite with former manager G<U+00E9>rard Houllier. On 23 August 2006, the move came to fruition following the departure of Diarra's namesake, [[Mahamadou Diarra|Mahamadou]], who moved to Spanish club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for a fee of <U+20AC>26 million.

On 13 August 2004, Diarra was named to the [[France national football team|senior national team]] for the first time by Domenech to participate in a friendly match against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/cisse-and-diarra-named-in-france-squad | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Cisse and Diarra named in France squad  |date = 13 August 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref> He did not make his debut in the match, but was named to the team again in October for [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches against the [[Republic of Ireland|Republic of Ireland]] and [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-shines-in-france | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra shines in France  |date = 4 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref>  Diarra earn his debut cap in the match against Ireland appearing as a substitute for [[Olivier Dacourt]] in a 0<U+2013>0 draw.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-makes-french-debut | publisher = [[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra makes French debut   |date = 10 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}</ref> He featured with the team heavily in World Cup qualification primarily as a substitute for either Patrick Vieira or [[Claude Mak<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>]] and, following France's qualification for the tournament, was named to the team to participate in the competition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/304080.shtml | publisher = [[French Football Federation]] | title = Les "Mondialistes" en chiffres |date = 14 May 2006 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French }}</ref> In the competition, Diarra appeared in two matches.

After appearing in a November 2006 friendly match against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], Diarra was absent from the national team for nearly two years, partly due to his struggle for playing time in [[Lyon]]. As a result, he missed [[UEFA Euro 2008]], although he was named to the competition's preliminary squad. After regaining his form at Bordeaux, Diarra began making his way back into the team and participated in seven [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] matches. He was later selected to participate in his second consecutive FIFA World Cup. France endured a disastrous campaign as the players went on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of [[striker]] [[Nicolas Anelka]] from the team. In the team's final group stage match against hosts [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], with several veteran players missing from the squad, Diarra was rewarded with the captaincy for the first time in his international career and led the team to a 2<U+2013>1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sport.fr/football/l-equipe-de-france-de-football-alou-diarra-bon-capitaine-199078.shtm | publisher = Football365 | title = Alou Diarra, bon capitaine? |date = 11 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.girondins.com/diarra-capitaine-en-bleu.html | publisher = [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]] | title = Diarra <U+2013> Capitaine en bleu |date = 22 June 2010 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}</ref> 

Diarra was one of several players retained by incoming coach [[Laurent Blanc]], his former manager. After missing the August 2010 friendly due to suspension, he returned to the team in September playing the entire match in 2<U+2013>0 wins over both Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Diarra served as captain in both matches.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/125426/a-diarra-capitaine-valbuena-titulaire/ | publisher = [[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = A.
