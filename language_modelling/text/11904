"[http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/nov/11ek.htm Amitabh Bachchan: Man On Fire]." ''[[Rediff.com]]''. 11 November 2005. Retrieved on 28 March 2012.</ref> Lakhia explained that "[[Man on Fire (novel)|Man On Fire]] has been made into four films in five different languages.<!--This is the quote, even though we know of only three films, including this one, the 1987 French-Italian production, and the 2004 American film--> So this is the Indian version. It has all the necessarily ingredients required for a movie to come out of India."<ref name="Chhabra"/> [[Vikram Chatwal]], who plays Ravi Rathore in the film, said "People talk a lot about cross cultural films. These films don't necessarily have to be like [[Monsoon Wedding]] or [[Bend It Like Beckham]]. This is not another [[Hindi film]]. This is not a remake of [[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]. If you see the way it is shot, edited and directed, it is setting new standards. Mr Bachchan is reinventing himself. So please don't turn this film into another Bollywood film."<ref name="Chhabra"/>

The film was shot on location in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], for 35 days. Lakhia said that he and [[Bunty Walia]], a producer, chose Bangkok because "we wanted our characters to stand out. When they are walking on the street they will look different. Both my heroes are over six feet and Thai men are not as tall. So it was really important to be in a place where they could stand out."<ref name="Chhabra"/>
