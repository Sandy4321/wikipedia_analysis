The '''history of Georgetown University''' spans over four hundred years, from the early settlement of America to the present day.<ref name=ce/> [[Georgetown University]] has grown with both its city, [[Washington, D.C.]], and the [[United States]], each of which date their founding to the period from 1788 to 1790.<ref name=nevils/> Georgetown's origins are in the establishment of the [[Maryland colony]] in the seventeenth-century. Bishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] established the school at its present location by the [[Potomac River]] after the [[American Revolution]] allowed for free religious practice.

The role of the [[Society of Jesus]] in the school's operation has evolved from that of founders and financiers to faculty and advisers. Their focus on liberal studies and religious pluralism have helped to give the school its identity. Georgetown was also affected by its times, including the [[American Civil War]], which disrupted the growing school and significantly changed its student body. [[Presidents of Georgetown University|University presidents]] like [[Patrick Francis Healy]] modernized the institution into an active research university with several graduate and undergraduate schools, and oversaw the expansion of educational opportunities on campus, around the city, and abroad.

==Founding==

The history of Georgetown University traces back to two formative events, in 1634 and 1789. Until 1851, the school used 1788, the start of construction on the Old South building, as its founding date. In that year a copy-edit in the college catalog began mislabeling the construction as beginning in 1789. This was discovered in preparation for the centennial celebration in 1889, at which point rather than correct the annual, the date of Georgetown's foundation was fixed to the date January 23, 1789.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=7}}</ref>

===First establishments===
On November 22, 1633 [[Jesuit]]s [[Andrew White (Missionary)|Andrew White]], John Altham Gravenor, and Thomas Gervase set sail on ''The Ark'' for [[British North America]] under the leadership and financing of the [[Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], [[Leonard Calvert]].<ref name=nevils>{{harvnb|Nevils|1934|pp=1<U+2014>25}}</ref> Their landing on March 25, 1634 on [[St. Clement's Island]] marks the birth of the [[History of Maryland#Colonial Maryland|Maryland colony]], this anniversary now celebrated as [[Maryland Day]]. These Jesuits were joined in 1637 by [[Thomas Copley]] and [[Ferdinand Poulton]], together establishing near [[St. Mary's City, Maryland|St. Mary's City]] some means of [[Christian]] education for the native [[Yaocomico]] tribe.<ref name=ce>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06083b.htm |title= Philip Fisher |first= Edward P. |last= Spillane |year= 1909 |encyclopedia= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |publisher= Robert Appleton Company |accessdate= March 6, 2007}}</ref>

Inquiring about patronage for their school, Poulton wrote to [[Vincenzo Carafa]], the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]] in Rome under [[Pope Urban VIII]], who on September 15, 1640 approved the institution of a school in principle.<ref>{{harvnb|Burns|1908|p=90}}</ref> That year they moved to a permanent building at Calverton Manor on in the [[Wicomico River (Potomac River)|Wicomico River]]. This early establishment was burnt in 1645 as part of the [[English Civil War]], and the remaining Jesuits were brought to trial in England. The new Protestant administration had their school outlawed, though it was functioning by 1648, when Thomas Copley managed to return there.<ref name=ce/>

Newtown Manor, also known as "Bretton's Neck", near modern-day [[Leonardtown, Maryland]], become available to the Jesuits in 1677. This house served as the Jesuit schoolhouse until 1704 when its existence was alerted to British authorities. The school afterward conducted itself periodically and in secrecy at the new Jesuit colony of [[Bohemia Manor]]. [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] attended this school from 1745 until 1748.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/case3.htm |title= The Bohemia Manor Academy |work= [http://library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/bicmain.htm Bicentennial Exhibit] |accessdate= March 6, 2007}}</ref> Carroll then left for studies in Europe, but was forced to return to Maryland in 1774, after [[Pope Clement XIV]] ordered the suppression of the Jesuit order.<ref name=bulletin/> This put Carroll in the right place at the right time, when the [[American Revolution]] pushed out the English administration, opening up new possibilities for scholastic expansion.

After returning in 1774 to live on the [[Rock Creek Park|Rock Creek]] in Maryland, Carroll established [[St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Silver Spring, Maryland)|Saint John the Evangelist Church]], in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. In 1776, his cousin, [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] invited John to join him, [[Samuel Chase]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] in traveling to [[Quebec]] and attempt to persuade the [[French Canadian]] population to join the revolution. The mission was unsuccessful, but John Carroll's association with Benjamin Franklin proved useful. In 1784, Franklin, as [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]], recommended Carroll to the papal [[nuncio]] in [[Paris]] as the head of the Catholic Church in American, and on June 9, 1784 Carroll was anointed ''Superior of Missions in the United States of North America''. On November 6, 1789 Carroll's authority was confirmed after being elected by the clergy as the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Bishop of Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.archbalt.org/our-history/ordinaries-detail.cfm?customel_datapageid_999=1343 |title= Most Rev.

Beginning in 1783, Carroll convened meetings of area clergy, mostly ex-Jesuits, at [[Sacred Heart Church (Bowie, Maryland)|Sacred Heart Church]] in White Marsh, outside [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. This body, known as the General Chapters, resolved on November 13, 1786, that "a school be erected for the education of youth" and that the location for the school would be in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].<ref>{{harvnb|Easby-Smith|1907|pp=22<U+2014>24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sacredheartbowie.org/history.php |title= Parish History |work= Sacred Heart Church |accessdate= March 2, 2010}}</ref> The site was influenced by Carroll's experience with Jesuit colleges in Europe, where were located in urban centers.<ref>{{harvnb|Curran|1993|p=20}}</ref> Port towns were used by Jesuits because of their missionary focus. By March 1787, they formed a fund raising committee, and Carroll solicited formal proposals for an "academy, at George-town, Patowmack-River, Maryland."<ref name=timeline/> The [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia's]] borders wouldn't be defined until the passage and implementation of the [[Residence Act]] in 1790.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Residence.html |title= Residence Act |work= [[Library of Congress]] |date= January 7, 2010 |accessdate= March 8, 2010}}</ref>

On April 24, 1787, Georgetown landowner John Threlkeld donated a plot of land to Carroll, which was ultimately where [[Holy Trinity Catholic Church (Washington, D.C.)|Holy Trinity Church]] was built.<ref>{{harvnb|Warner|1994|p=3<U+2014>5}}</ref> In April 1788, construction began at a larger neighboring plot on Georgetown's first building, later called "Old South", leading Carroll to write "We shall begin the building of our Academy this summer.

==Early growth==
Carroll had difficulty filling the position of [[List of Presidents of Georgetown University|president of the university]], with many candidates declining the job before Robert Plunkett first took the office in 1791, though he only served 18 months. He oversaw the division of the academy into "[[Georgetown College (Georgetown University)|college]]", "[[Georgetown Preparatory School|preparatory]]", and "elementary", with the youngest starting at age eight. Georgetown's second building, Old North, which survives to this day, began construction in 1794. At three times the size of Old South, it greatly increased the number of classrooms and sleeping space on campus.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=13<U+2014>14}}</ref> Upon the building's completion, [[George Washington]] visited and spoke from the porch, a position since reserved for [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]].

[[Image:Neale large.jpg|thumb|left|Archbishop Leonard Neale overlooking Georgetown College in 1798|alt=A painting of a priest with thin brown hair facing his left in front of a parted curtain that reveals a series of buildings in the background.]]
In its early years, Georgetown suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local Jesuit-owned lands.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=12}}</ref> By September 1792, tuition had to be increased for the first time.<ref name=timeline/> In 1796, [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg]] arrived and became president. Dubourg brought with him a collection of books from his own collection and others from [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St. Mary's Seminary]], the Baltimore [[Society of Saint-Sulpice]], and these books formed the nucleus of Georgetown's library.<ref name=library>{{cite web |url= http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/libhist.htm |title= Special Collections at Georgetown: A Brief History |work= [http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll Georgetown Universities Libraries Special Collections] |date= November 11, 2000 |accessdate= September 11, 2007}}</ref> On January 1, 1798, Dubourg released the first prospectus to advertise the college abroad, but also drove the school into debt by hiring numerous new faculty, including fencing teachers, and by buying silver and a school piano.<ref name=case5>{{cite web |url= http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/case5.htm |title= The Early Years |work= Georgetown University Libraries |date= November 11, 2000 |accessdate= October 16, 2009}}</ref> The first board of directors organized in 1797, and quickly became antagonized with Dubourg because of his spending and preference for French faculty, and forced him to resign in December 1798.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/sulpicia.htm |title= The French Sulpicians |first= George M |last= Barringer |work= [http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll Georgetown Universities Libraries Special Collections] |date= November 11, 2000 |accessdate= September 11, 2007}}</ref>

Beginning in 1798, [[Leonard Neale]] and his brother [[Francis Neale]] oversaw the growth of the university as presidents for a combined eleven years. Leonard Neale acted in the dual capacity of president and tutor for several years and under his guidance the institution was developed from an academy into a college in 1801. 
Carroll applied to Rome to name Neale as his [[coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]], and Neale was appointed coadjutor in 1800. In 1799 Neale invited three sisters of the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary]] to open a convent at Georgetown. On June 24, 1799, the young [[Visitation Convent, Georgetown|Visitation Convent]] under Mother [[Teresa Lalor]] began a Saturday school for young women.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.visi.org/about_visitation/historytraditions.aspx |title= History & Traditions |work= [[Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School]] |accessdate= May 4, 2009}}</ref> This developed into an academy, now [[Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School]], in 1802. Leonard Neale remained as president of Georgetown until 1806 when he was succeeded by [[Robert Molyneux]], who died in 1808. Leonard Neale's brother, Francis Neale, then became president of Georgetown College in 1809.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10728d.htm |title= Leonard Neale |first= J.

The [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuits]] in Maryland ended in 1805. In 1806 the school commenced a [[novitiate]] for Jesuit recruits moving from [[Russia]], which had harbored the Society during the suppression.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|1895|p=281}}</ref> John Carroll didn't seek civil recognition for Georgetown until after the suppression of the full Society ended in 1814. Instead of seeking a state charter, he went to the federal government, then in charge of the District of Columbia. Now [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] William Gaston sponsored the legislation, and Georgetown received the first federal charter on March 1, 1815.<ref name=charter>{{cite web |url= http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080103020623/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html |archivedate= January 3, 2008 |title= The Federal Charter |work= [[Georgetown University]] |accessdate= March 6, 2007}}</ref> Founder John Carroll died December 3, 1815, and in his will he left Georgetown four-hundred [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], which marked the beginning of Georgetown's endowment.<ref name=library/>

The new charter allowed Georgetown to grant academic degrees for the first time. The college's first two official graduates, a pair of brothers from [[New York]] named Charles and George Dinnies, were awarded the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|bachelor of arts]] in 1817.<ref name=charter/> Other Jesuit schools would confer degrees under Georgetown's charter for many years afterward.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=20}}</ref> Graduate degrees were awarded for the first time in 1821.<ref name=timeline/> In 1833, the [[Holy See]] empowered Georgetown to confer degrees in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. On June 10, 1844, the school was reincorporated by Congress under the name ''The President and Directors of Georgetown College''. [[Georgetown University Astronomical Observatory|Georgetown's Observatory]], completed in 1844, was used in 1846 to determine the latitude and longitude of Washington, D.C., which was the first such calculation for the nation's capital.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=28}}</ref>

In 1830, construction of an infirmary in the new Gervase Building brought the first hospital beds to Georgetown. In 1849, four Catholic doctors frustrated with discriminatory practices at neighboring Columbian College (later renamed [[George Washington University]]) petitioned Georgetown President James Ryder to found a medical program.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=35}}</ref> A building for this purpose was purchased at 12th and F Streets, and the [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] was founded in 1850, holding its first classes the following year.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://som.georgetown.edu/docs/History.pdf |format= PDF |work= [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]] |title= History |date= March 23, 2008 |accessdate= March 24, 2009}}</ref>

From its beginning, Georgetown was not intended to be exclusively Catholic, and over its first ten years, nearly one-fifth of students were Protestant. A fifth of students were also from the [[Caribbean]]. By 1830, Jewish students were known to be attending. European immigrants and [[Napoleonic War]] refugees also made up significant parts of the early student body.<ref name=bulletin/> School rules were harshly enforced. Leonard Neale, a strict moralist, regulated students' movements such that founder John Carrol accused him of running Georgetown "on the principles of a convent."<ref name=case5/> There were three student organized rebellions against the Georgetown administration in the [[antebellum era|antebellum]] period. The most notable of these occurred in January 1850, against the administration of James A. Ryder over the school food. Students damaged the dormitories and took charge of a local hotel.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/case6.htm |title= The Academy becomes a College |date= November 11, 2000 |accessdate= September 11, 2007 |work= [http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll Georgetown Universities Libraries Special Collections]}}</ref>

The first student society, the [[Sodality of Our Lady|Sodality]] was founded in 1810 as a religious devotional group.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=25}}</ref> A strict revision of school rules in 1829 forbade personal conversations or particular associations.<ref name=case5/> Despite this the [[Philodemic Society]] was founded in 1830 as the schools debating society, the oldest of its kind in America and the oldest secular group at Georgetown.

[[American Civil War|The Civil War]] was an important and tragic time for the University. Beginning on December 11, 1859 the [[Philodemic Society]] debated whether or not the southern states should secede. The debate lasted weeks, and after the Society affirmed secession, a brawl ensued, and debates were canceled for the rest of 1860.<ref name=goundrey/> Fist fights on campus between northern and southern students soon became common. Beginning in 1861, many students left their studies to join the war. 925 students ultimately enlisted with the [[Confederate Army]] and 216 with the [[Union Army]]; between them 106 died in the war. Enrollment dropped from 313 students in 1859 to only 17 late in 1861.<ref name=bulletin>{{cite web |url= http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html |title=Georgetown: A Brief History |first= Robert Emmett |last= Curran |work= [http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/index.html Undergraduate Bulletin] |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate= August 27, 2007}}</ref> By 1862, Georgetown only had 120 total students, about ten percent of what it was just a few years earlier.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm |title= Georgetown University |encyclopedia= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year= 1909 |publisher= Robert Appleton Company |first= E.I. |last= Devitt |accessdate= July 10, 2007}}</ref> Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 a decade prior.

Responding to lack of adequate hospital beds and housing for soldiers needed to protect the District, the Union commandeered University buildings, and by the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400 Union Army troops were stationed in temporary quarters there.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=36}}</ref> 1,300 of them were from the [[69th Infantry Regiment (United States)|69th Infantry Regiment]], which established itself in Maguire Hall from May 4, 1841 to June when the unit was replaced by the [[79th New York Volunteer Infantry]].

Georgetown would later be connected to the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].

The war drastically changed Georgetown, making it both more northern and more Catholic.<ref name=bulletin/> Increasingly larger percentages of the student body came from northern cities, more populated with Catholic immigrants, while the student body had been primarily southern before the war.<ref name=timeline/> This dynamic is expressed in Georgetown's official school colors. In 1876, Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's rowing team, adopted blue, from the [[uniform of the Union Army]], and gray, from the [[uniforms of the Confederate States military forces]], as their team colors in order to signify the peaceful unity between students from the North and those from the South.

Numerous new schools were founded during twentieth-century. The [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] (SFS) was founded in 1919 by [[Edmund A. Walsh]] to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy.<ref name= bulletin/> The School of Languages and Linguistics was organized in 1949 and the School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1955. New developments also came to [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. In 1898, [[Georgetown University Hospital]] was first established on campus. Georgetown obtained the Washington Dental College in 1901, and integrated it with the medical school.<ref name=bulletin>{{cite web |url= http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html |title=Georgetown: A Brief History |first= Robert Emmett |last= Curran |work= [http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/index.html Undergraduate Bulletin] |publisher= Georgetown University |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate= September 6, 2007}}</ref> In 1903, Georgetown University began an undergraduate medical program with the [[School of Nursing and Health Studies|School of Nursing]].

Georgetown, as a major world university, has been featured in many media over the years. The most prominent example is the 1971 [[horror novel]], ''[[The Exorcist]]'', written by [[William Peter Blatty]], who received an English degree from Georgetown in 1950. The novel is loosely based on a series of 1949 exorcisms conducted on a fourteen-year-old boy at [[Georgetown University Hospital]], nearby [[Maryland]], and in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. In 1973, Blatty's bestselling novel was made into a film, also titled ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''. Like the novel, the film was set at Georgetown and filmed on campus during the fall semester in 1972.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=119}}</ref> The climatic scene uses a steep staircase between Prospect Street and Canal Road, previously know popularly as the "Hitchcock Steps" for their spooky appeal.

The 1985 "[[Brat Pack (movies)|Brat Pack]]" movie ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' also revolved around a group of students who had just graduated from Georgetown.
