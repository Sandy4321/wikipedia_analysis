The '''Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovak Republic''' (KOZ SR) is a [[national trade union center]] in [[Slovakia]].

In March, 1990 the [[Czechoslovak Confederation of Trade Unions]] (CSKOS) was formed from the remains of the [[Central Council of Trade Unions]] (URO). Within months, as the separation of the two states developed, the party was divided into the [[Bohemian-Moravian Chamber]] (CMK CSKOS) and the KOZ SR.

The KOZ SR is affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], and the [[European Trade Union Confederation]], as well as having observer status at the [[Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD]].

During the Dzurinda-era the KOZ was more and more weakened. In 2006 KOZ and the social-democratic [[SMER]] agreed on co-operation and the KOZ appelled for voting the SMER. Since the SMER-election winning in 2006 the KOZ gained more and more strength.<ref>[http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb5/frieden/regionen/Slowakei/politik.html Hannes Hofbauer: ''Die R<U+00FC>ckkehr der Politik - Im Billiglohnland Slowakei ger<U+00E4>t der Neoliberalismus zusehends in die Defensive'', junge Welt, 23 January 2008.]</ref>
