'''Naturopathic medicine''' (also known as '''naturopathy''' or '''natural medicine''') is a [[complementary and alternative medicine]] which emphasizes the ability of the body to heal and maintain itself, which practitioners believe is innate. Naturopathic practice may include different modalities and practitioners emphasize a [[holistic health|holistic]] approach to patient care, and may recommend patients use conventional medicine alongside their treatments. Naturopathy has its origins in the Nature Cure movement of Europe<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Naturopathy|url=http://www.naturopathy-uk.com/library/2007/03/12/history-of-naturopathy/|year=2007}}</ref>.    It is practiced in many countries but subject to different standards of regulation and levels of acceptance. 

Naturopathic practitioners prefer not to use invasive [[surgery]], or most synthetic [[medication|drugs]], preferring natural remedies, for instance relatively unprocessed or whole medications, such as herbs and foods. Graduates of a [[naturopathic medical school in North America]] are trained to use diagnostic tests such as [[imaging]] and [[blood tests]] before deciding upon the full course of treatment.  If the patient does not respond to these treatments, they are often referred to physicians who utilize standard medical care to treat the disease or condition.  In some states, naturopathic doctors who hold an [[Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine|ND]] are licensed to prescribe pharmaceutical medicines and perform minor surgeries.

==History of naturopathic medicine==
Some see the ancient Greek "Father of Medicine", [[Hippocrates]], as the first advocate of naturopathic medicine.  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturopathy-uk.com/home/home-what-is-naturopathy/|title=What is Naturopathy?|year=1998}}</ref>.  In Scotland, [[Thomas Allinson|Dr Thomas Allinson]] started advocating naturopathy in the 1880s, promoting a natural diet and exercise with avoidance of tobacco and overwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allinsonflour.co.uk/aa_dr_allinson.cfm|title=Dr Thomas Allinson|year=2003}}</ref> 

In the USA, the term naturopathy was coined before 1900, by John Scheel, and used by [[Benedict Lust]]. Lust had been schooled in [[hydrotherapy]] and other natural health practices in [[Germany]] by Father [[Sebastian Kneipp]], who sent Lust to the [[United States]] to bring them Kneipp's methods. In 1905, Lust founded the American School of Naturopathy in [[New York]], the first naturopathic college in the United States. Lust took great strides in promoting the profession, culminating in passage of licensing laws in several states prior to 1935, including [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington]] and the founding of several naturopathic colleges.

Naturopathic medicine went into decline, along with most other natural health professions, after the 1930s, with the discovery of penicillin and advent of synthetic drugs such as [[antibiotics]] and [[corticosteroids]]. In the post-war era, Lust's death, conflict between various schools of natural medicine ([[homeopathy]], [[eclectics]], physio-medicalism, [[herbalism]], naturopathy, etc.), and the rise of medical technology were all contributing factors. In 1910, when the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] published the [[Flexner Report]] which criticized many aspects of medical education in various institutions (natural and conventional), it was mostly seen as an attack on low-quality natural medicine education. It caused many such programs to shut down and contributed to the popularity of conventional medicine.                                      

Naturopathic medicine never completely ceased to exist, however, as there were always a few states in which licensing laws existed&mdash;though at one point there were virtually no schools. One of the most visible steps towards the profession's modern renewal was the opening in 1956 of the [[National College of Naturopathic Medicine]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. This was the first of the modern naturopathic medical schools offering four-year naturopathic medical training with the intention of integrating science with naturopathic principles and practice. Today there are six [[List of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Schools in North America|accredited naturopathic medical schools]] in North America.

===Naturopathy In India===
There are also many doctors trained in conventional medicine who have acquired naturopathy degrees so as to integrate the insights gained into their system of practice.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The Indian stream of naturopathy differs from the Western stream in many ways, particularly in their emphasis on strict [[vegetarian]]ism and [[yoga]].{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

===Naturopathic practitioners===
There are two groups in North America calling themselves "naturopaths" who have recently been engaged in legal battles.  The term when originally coined by John Scheel, and popularized by Dr. [[Benedict Lust]] was to apply to those receiving an education in the basic medical sciences with an emphasis on natural therapies. This usage best describes modern day naturopathic physicians. In the absence of universal regulation of naturopathy, another group of practitioners (the so-called 'traditional naturopaths') has emerged. Additionally, a variety of health care professionals may incorporate naturopathic principles and modalities into their practice. 
<!-- Seems a bit redundant as this distinction is made clear below
*Naturopathic Physicians are formally educated at an accredited school, board-licensed, and are exclusively designated ND or NMD in jurisdictions where these titles are protected.
*Traditional naturopaths have no standardized education, are not board-licensed, may sometimes use the title DNM, but sometimes claim the ND designation in jurisdictions where titles are not protected.-->

===Naturopathic physicians===
[[Naturopathic doctor|Naturopathic physicians]] in North America are primary care providers<ref>http://www.naturalmedicinect.com/</ref> trained in conventional medical sciences, diagnosis and treatment, and are experts in natural therapeutics.  Licensing and training requirements vary from state to state, but at least 15 states<!-- to be consistent with Regulation in North America described below  -->, the District of Columbia, and four Canadian provinces have formal licensing and educational requirements. <ref>[http://www.naturopathic.org/viewbulletin.php?id=118 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians]</ref><ref>[http://www.cand.ca Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors - Welcome!<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
In these jurisdictions, Naturopathic Physicians must pass comprehensive board exams set by the [[North American Board of Naturopathic Examiners]] (NABNE)<ref>[http://www.nabne.org NABNE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> after having completed academic and clinical training at a college certified by the [[Council on Naturopathic Medical Education]] (CNME)<ref>[http://www.cnme.org Council on Naturopathic Medical Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. The letters ND usually designate a naturopathic doctor or physician in jurisdictions where such a title is protected by law.

===Traditional naturopaths===
Traditional naturopaths are guided by the same naturopathic philosophies and principles as board-licensed Naturopathic physicians and often prescribe similar treatments but do so as alternative or complimentary practitioners rather than as primary care providers. Some may voluntarily join a professional organization, but these organizations do not accredit educational programs in any meaningful way or license practitioners per se. The training programs for traditional naturopaths can vary greatly, are less rigorous and do not provide the same basic and clinical science education as naturopathic medical schools do.  The professional organizations formed by traditional naturopaths are not recognized by the U.S. Government or any U.S. State or Territory.

===Other health care professionals===
According to a 1998 taskforce report, many conventionally trained physicians are choosing to add naturopathic modalities to their practice<ref>[http://www.futurehealth.ucsf.edu/pdf_files/RTF.PDF]</ref>, and states such as Texas have begun to establish practice guidelines for MDs who integrate alternative and complementary medicine into their practice <ref>Texas Administrative Code title 22, part 9 <U+00A7> 200.3, 1998</ref>. Continuing education in naturopathic modalities for health care professionals varies greatly but includes offerings for practitioners who hold a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.), Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.), Licensed Acupuncturist (L.Ac.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Physician<U+2019>s Assistant (P.A.), and Registered Nurses (R.N.)<ref>[http://www.futurehealth.ucsf.edu/pdf_files/Naturo2.pdf Profile of Profession: Naturopathic Practice]</ref>. These professionals usually retain their original designation but may use terms such as 'holistic', 'natural', or 'integrative' to describe their practice.

==Regulation of naturopathic medicine==
{{Globalise}}

In some jurisdictions the practice of naturopathic medicine is unregulated and so the titles like "naturopath", "naturopathic doctor", and "doctor of natural medicine" are not protected by law. This may lead to difficulty in ensuring that a practitioner is trained to a particular standard or has adequate liability insurance.

===Regulation in Australia===
There is currently no state [[licensure]] in [[Australia]], rather the industry is self-regulated. There is no protection of title, meaning that technically anyone can practise as a naturopath. The only way to obtain [[insurance]] for professional [[indemnity]] or public [[Liability insurance|liability]] is by joining a [[Professional body|professional association]], which can only be achieved having completed an [[School accreditation|accredited]] course and gaining [[professional certification]]. Currently the only registered modalities of natural medicine in Australia are those relating to Chinese medicine, and only in the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].{{Fact|date=May 2007}}

===Regulation in North America===
{{see also|List of accredited naturopathic medical schools in North America | Naturopathic medical school in North America}}
Jurisdictions that currently regulate naturopathic medicine include:
*U.S. jurisdictions with full licensure: [[Alaska]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[District of Columbia]], [[Hawaii]], [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[Montana]], [[Vermont]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Utah]], [[Washington]].<ref>[http://www.naturopathic.org/viewbulletin.php?id=118 American Association of Naturopathic Physicians]</ref>
*[[Utah]] licensed N.D.s can only prescribe medications listed from the Naturopathic Physician Formulary. [http://www.rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r156/r156-71.htm#E5]
*U.S. state with registration for naturopathic physicians: [[Kansas]]<ref>[http://www.ksbha.org/ Kansas State Board of Healing Arts]</ref>
*U.S. jurisdictions with two-tier licensure: [[Puerto Rico]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*U.S. states with legal basis for practice: [[Rhode Island]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}
*U.S. states which specifically prohibit the practice of naturopathy: [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]]
*Canadian provinces with full licensure: [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]] <ref>[http://www.cand.ca/index.php?40 Canadian Association of Naturopathic Doctors]</ref>

===Regulation in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], there is no government sponsored regulation of the naturopathy profession. The largest registering body, The General Council & Register of Naturopaths, recognises three courses in the UK, two being taught at osteopathic schools: the [[British College of Osteopathic Medicine]]; The [[College of Osteopaths Educational Trust]]; and one at the [[University of Westminster]] School of Integrated Health under the auspices of the B.Sc Health Science (Naturopathy) course.  

Members of this register will either have completed a three or four year full time [[Academic degree|degree]] level course or possibly be a [[Health profession|healthcare professional]] (Medical Doctor, Osteopath, Chiropractor, Nurse) who has completed a two year post-graduate Naturopathic Diploma, the N.D.  As the naturopathic profession has developed along different lines in the UK, naturopaths do not perform minor surgery or have prescribing rights.
