This is a '''list of Indian state and union territory capitals'''. 

[[India]] is divided into twenty-nine states and six [[union territories]] (UTs)and one [[national capital territory]]. States have their own government, whereas UTs are administered by the [[Government of India|Central government]]. However, [[Pondicherry]], a UT, has its own elected government. The [[National Capital Territory of Delhi]] is a special region that has its own elected government and a status in between a state and a union territory.

==Capitals==
The state and union territory capitals are sorted according to the administrative, legislative and judicial capitals. The administrative capital is where the executive government offices are located, the legislative capital is where the [[Vidhan Sabha|state assembly]] convenes, and the judicial capital is the location of the state or territorial [[High Courts of India]].

The date mentioned refers to when the city became the capital of the state or territory. In the following table ''S'' and ''W'' refers to the summer and winter sessions respectively. ''B'' refers to the budget session of the legislature.

The administrative capital in bold lettering is considered to be the ''main'' capital of the state. The former capital refers to a city which was the capital from admission into the Indian Union. An absence of a legislative capital means that it is administered by the Central government.

After that, in 1956, [[Berar]]([[Vidarbha]]) was separated from [[Madhya Pradesh]], and merged with the [[Bombay State]]. Nagpur, thus lost the status of a capital city.

Owing to the lack of seriousness, which the Maharashtra government attaches to this session, it is often referred to as the "picnic session".</ref>
