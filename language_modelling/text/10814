'''Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Fran<U+00E7>ois Chopin''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|<U+0283>|o<U+028A>|p|<U+00E6>|n}}; {{IPA-fr|f<U+0281>e.de.<U+0281>ik <U+0283><U+0254>.p<U+025B><U+0303>}}; 22&nbsp;February or 1&nbsp;March 1810{{spaced ndash}}17&nbsp;October 1849), born '''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''',{{#tag:ref|In Polish, pronounced {{IPA-pl|<U+02C8><U+0282><U+0254>p<U+025B>n|}}, with alternative, [[phonetic]] spelling ''Szopen''.|group=n}} was a [[Romantic music|Romantic]]-era Polish composer. A [[child prodigy]], Chopin was born in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. He grew up in [[Warsaw]], which after 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]], and there completed his musical education and composed many of his works before leaving Poland, aged 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]].

At the age of 21 he settled in Paris (obtaining French nationality in 1835). During the remaining 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]; he supported himself by selling his compositions and as a sought-after piano teacher, and gained renown as a leading virtuoso of his generation. He formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including [[Robert Schumann]]. After a failed engagement with a Polish girl, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer [[George Sand]]. A brief and unhappy visit with Sand to [[Majorca]] in 1838<U+2013>39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health; he died in Paris in 1849, probably of [[tuberculosis]].

All of Chopin's compositions include the piano; most are for solo piano, although he also wrote two [[piano concertos]], a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs]] to Polish [[lyrics]]. His [[musical keyboard|keyboard]] style, which is highly individual, is often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]]; his major piano works also include [[sonata]]s, [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise]]s, [[<U+00E9>tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, and [[prelude (music)|prelude]]s, some published only after his death. Many contain elements of both Polish [[folk music]] and of the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[J.S. Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], whom Chopin particularly admired. Chopin's innovations in style, [[musical form]], and [[harmony]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.

Both in his native Poland and beyond, Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest 'superstars', his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his amours and his early death have made him, in the public consciousness, a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.

In October 1810, six months after Chopin's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the [[Warsaw Lyceum]], then housed in the [[Saxon Palace]]. Chopin's father played the [[flute]] and violin;<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>6</ref> his mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.<ref name="woyciechowski"/> Even in early childhood, Chopin was slight of build and prone to illnesses.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), 6 (loc. 142).</ref>

Chopin may have had some piano instruction from his mother, but his first professional music tutor, from 1816 to 1821, was the [[Czech people|Czech]] [[Wojciech <U+017B>ywny]].<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>1, para. 3">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>1, para. 3</ref> Chopin's elder sister Ludwika also took lessons from <U+017B>ywny, and occasionally played duets with her brother.<ref>Samson (1996), p. 8.</ref> The seven-year-old Chopin began giving public concerts, and in 1817 he composed two [[polonaise]]s, in [[G minor]] and [[B-flat major]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/the-complete-solo-works/chopin-the-complete-keyboard-works/ "The Complete Keyboard Works"], Chopin Project website, accessed 21.12.2013</ref> Chopin's next work, a polonaise in A-flat major of 1821, dedicated to <U+017B>ywny, is his earliest surviving musical manuscript.<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>1, para. 3"/>

During this period, Chopin was sometimes invited to the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] as playmate to the son of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]]'s ruler, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]]; he played the piano for the Duke and composed a march for him. [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], in his dramatic [[eclogue]], "''Nasze Przebiegi''" ("Our Discourses", 1818), attested to "little Chopin's" popularity.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 11<U+2013>12 (location 231<U+2013>248).</ref>

===Education===
[[File:J<U+00F3>zef Elsner.PNG|thumb|upright=0.6|[[J<U+00F3>zef Elsner]] after 1853]]From September 1823 to 1826 Chopin attended the [[Warsaw Lyceum]].<ref>Samson (1996), p. 15.</ref> In the autumn of 1826, Chopin commenced a three-year course of studies with the [[Silesia]]n composer [[J<U+00F3>zef Elsner]] studying [[music theory]], [[figured bass]], and [[musical composition|composition]] at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Warsaw Conservatory]].<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>1, para. 5.">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>1, para. 5.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Conservatory was affiliated with the [[University of Warsaw]]; hence Chopin is counted among the [[University of Warsaw#Notable alumni|university's alumni]].|group=n}} Throughout this period Chopin continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of a mechanical organ, the "eolomelodicon", and in May 1825 performed on this instrument part of a concerto by  [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]] and his own improvisation. The success of this concert resulted in him being asked to give a similar recital on the instrument before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented Chopin with a diamond ring. At a subsequent eolomelodicon concert (10 June 1825) Chopin performed his Rondo Op. 1 (the first of his works to be commercially published); this earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung|Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' praised his "wealth of musical ideas."<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 21<U+2013>2 (locs. 365<U+2013>387).</ref>

In 1824<U+2013>28 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales;{{#tag:ref|At [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]] (in 1824&nbsp;<U+2013> perhaps his first solo travel away from home&nbsp;<U+2013> and in 1825), [[Duszniki-Zdr<U+00F3>j|Duszniki]] (1826), [[Pomerania]] (1827) and [[Sanniki, Masovian Voivodeship|Sanniki]] (1828).<ref>Szklener (2010), p. 8.</ref>|group=n}} in 1824 and 1825, at [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]], where he was a guest of the father of his schoolmate [[Dominik Dziewanowski]]. Here for the first time Chopin encountered Polish rural [[folk music]].<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>1 para. 2.</ref> His missives home from Szafarnia (the self-styled "Szafarnia Courier" letters), written in a very modern and lively Polish, amused his family with their [[parody|spoofing]] of the Warsaw newspapers and demonstrated the youngster's literary gift.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 19<U+2013>20 (locs. 334<U+2013>352).</ref>

In 1827, soon after the death of Chopin's youngest sister Emilia, the family moved from their home in a Warsaw University building near the [[Kazimierz Palace]] to lodgings just across the street from the university, in the south annex of the [[Czapski Palace#History|Krasi<U+0144>ski Palace]] on [[Krakowskie Przedmie<U+015B>cie]]. {{#tag:ref|The palace is now the [[Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw|Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts]].|group=n}} Here the parents continued running a boarding house for male students; Chopin lived here until he left Warsaw in 1830. In 1829, the artist [[Ambro<U+017C>y Mieroszewski]] executed a set of portraits of Chopin family members, including the first known portrait of the composer.{{#tag:ref|The originals perished in World War II; only copies of illustrations remain.<ref>See Kuhnke (2010)</ref>|group=n}}{{#tag:ref|In 1837<U+2013>39, the artist-poet [[Cyprian Norwid]] lived here, and later wrote the poem, "Chopin's Piano", about the [[defenestration]] of the instrument by Russian troops in [[January Uprising#January Uprising in literature|1863]].<ref name="redniowiecza"/>|group=n}} The [[Chopin Family Parlor|Chopin Family Parlour]] (''Salonik Chopin<U+00F3>w'') is now a small museum open to the public.

Four boarders at his parents' apartments became Chopin's intimates: [[Tytus Woyciechowski]], [[Jan Bia<U+0142>ob<U+0142>ocki]], [[Jan Matuszy<U+0144>ski]] and [[Julian Fontana]]; the last two would later be part of Chopin's Paris milieu. Chopin was also friendly with members of Warsaw's young artistic and intellectual world, including [[J<U+00F3>zef Bohdan Zaleski]], Julian Fontana and [[Stefan Witwicki]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 43 (loc. 696).</ref> He was also attracted by the singer [[Konstancja G<U+0142>adkowska]]; in letters to his friend Woyciechowski, Chopin indicated which of his works, and even which of their passages, were influenced by his fascination with her.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 50<U+2013>51 (locs. 801<U+2013>823).</ref> In his final report from the Conservatory (July 1829), Chopin was recorded as showing "exceptional talent, musical genius."<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>1, para. 5."/>

===Travel===
[[File:Chopin concert.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Chopin playing his works before the Radziwill family in 1829 (1887 oil painting by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]])]]In September 1828, Chopin had visited Berlin with a family friend, the zoologist [[Feliks Pawe<U+0142> Jarocki|Feliks Jarocki]]. There he enjoyed operas directed by [[Gaspare Spontini]], attended several concerts, and saw [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and other celebrities. On a return trip to Berlin, he was a guest of Prince [[Antoni Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]], governor of the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]]<U+2014>himself an accomplished composer and aspiring [[cello|cellist]]. For the Prince and his pianist daughter Wanda, Chopin composed his [[Introduction and Polonaise brillante (Chopin)|Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major for cello and piano]], Op. 3.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 45 (loc. 731)</ref>

Back in Warsaw, in 1829, Chopin heard [[Niccol<U+00F2> Paganini]] play and met the pianist and composer [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]]. On 11 August of the same year, three weeks after completing his studies at the Warsaw Conservatory, Chopin made his debut in [[Vienna]]. He gave two piano concerts and received many favorable reviews<U+2014>in addition to some that criticized the "small tone" that he drew from the piano.<ref name="rjsfih"/> In one of these concerts on 11 August, he premiered his ''[[Variations on "L<U+00E0> ci darem la mano" (Chopin)|Variations on "L<U+00E0> ci darem la mano"]]'', Op. 2 (variations on a theme from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'') for piano and orchestra. On his return to Poland he premiered, in December 1829, at the Warsaw Merchants' Club, his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor]], Op. 21. In this period he also began writing his first ''<U+00C9>tudes'' (1829<U+2013>32).<ref name="rjsfih"/>

Chopin's successes as a composer and performer opened the door for him to western Europe, and on 2&nbsp;November 1830, he set out, in the words of [[Zdzis<U+0142>aw Jachimecki]], "into the wide world, with no very clearly defined aim, forever."<ref name="Jachimecki 1937, 422">Jachimecki (1937), p. 422</ref> With Woyciechowski he headed for Austria, intending to go on to Italy. Later that month, in Warsaw, the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] broke out, and Woyciechowski returned to Poland to enlist. Chopin, now alone in Vienna, was nostalgic for his homeland, and wrote to a friend, "I curse the moment of my departure."<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>2, para. 1</ref> When in September 1831 he learned, while traveling from Vienna to Paris, that the uprising had been crushed, he expressed his anguish in the pages of his private journal: "O God!&nbsp;... You are there, and yet you do not take vengeance!"<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>2, para. 3. The journal is now in the [[National Library of Poland]].</ref> Jachimecki ascribes to these events the composer's maturing "into an inspired [[national bard]] who intuited the past, present and future of his native Poland."<ref name="Jachimecki 1937, 422"/>

In France Chopin used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport.<ref name="free"/> However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants; he never felt fully comfortable speaking French.<ref name="Vanessa Gera">{{cite web|author=Vanessa Gera |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100219/eu-poland-celebrating-chopin/ |title=Poles Throw Bicentennial Bash for Chopin |publisher=[[Huffington Post]] |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref> Chopin's biographer [[Adam Zamoyski]] writes that Chopin never considered himself to be French, despite his father's ancestry, and always [[National identity|saw himself]] as a Pole.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 129</ref>

In Paris, Chopin found artists and other distinguished company, as well as opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity, and before long he was earning a handsome income teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>2, paras. 4<U+2013>5</ref> This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.<ref name="rjsfih"/> During his years in Paris he was to become acquainted with, amongst many others, [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Delacroix]], and [[Alfred de Vigny]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 106 (loc. 1678).</ref> Two Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried, without success, to establish himself in England; Albert Grzyma<U+0142>a, who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and "gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life."<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;106<U+2013>107 (locs. 1678<U+2013>1696).</ref> Fontana was to become, in the words of Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson, Chopin's "general [[servant|factotum]] and copyist."<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>3, para. 2</ref> Chopin was also acquainted with the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]],<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 137 (loc. 2164)</ref> some of whose verses he set as songs.

At the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when [[Robert Schumann]], reviewing Chopin's Op. 2 Variations in the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' (his first published article on music), declared: "Hats off, gentlemen! A genius."<ref>Schumann (1988), pp. 15<U+2013>17.</ref> On 26 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert at the [[Salle Pleyel]] which drew universal admiration. The critic [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Joseph F<U+00E9>tis]] wrote in the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale]]'': "Here is a young man who&nbsp;... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,&nbsp;... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else&nbsp;..."<ref>cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 88 (loc. 1384).</ref> After this concert, Chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private [[salon (gathering)|salons]] (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).<ref name="rjsfih"/>

[[File:Maria Wodzi<U+0144>ska.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.6||[[Maria Wodzi<U+0144>ska]], self-portrait]]Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons, but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. [[Arthur Hedley]] has observed that "As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances<U+2014>few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The list of musicians who took part in some of Chopin's concerts provides an indication of the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt and Hiller performed (on pianos) a [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)#Concertos for three harpsichords|concerto by J. S. Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; Chopin wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d), <U+00A7>2, para. 5.</ref>

In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where, for the last time in his life, he met with his parents. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi<U+0144>skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter [[Maria Wodzi<U+0144>ska|Maria]] in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via [[Leipzig]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;118<U+2013>9 (locs. 1861<U+2013>1878).</ref> The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as amongst Chopin's best likenesses.<ref name="demonstrated"/> In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met with Schumann, [[Clara Wieck]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St. Paul]]'', and who considered Chopin "a perfect musician".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;119<U+2013>20 (locs. 1878<U+2013>1896).</ref> In July 1836 Chopin traveled to [[Marienbad]] and [[Dresden]] to be with the Wodzi<U+0144>ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria; her mother Countess Wodzi<U+0144>ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his [[Ballades (Chopin)#Ballade No. 1|G minor Ballade]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;126<U+2013>7 (locs.1983<U+2013>2001).</ref> At the end of 1836 Chopin sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 [[Nocturnes, Op. 27 (Chopin)#Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1|Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1]].<ref>Jachimecki (1937), p. 423.</ref> The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.<ref>Chopin (1962), p. 144.</ref>

===George Sand===

In 1836, at a party hosted by Liszt's mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]], Chopin met the French author [[George Sand]] (real name: Aurore Dupin). Chopin initially felt an aversion to Sand, and wrote, "What an unattractive person la Sand is. Is she really a woman?"<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.) <U+00A7>3, para. 3.</ref> However, by early 1837 Maria's mother had made it clear to Chopin in correspondence that a marriage with her daughter was unlikely to proceed.<ref>Chopin (1962), p. 141.</ref> It is thought that she was influenced by his poor health and possibly also by rumours about his associations with women such as d'Agoult and Sand.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;137<U+2013>8 (locs. 2169<U+2013>2186).</ref> Chopin finally placed the letters from Maria and her mother in a package on which he wrote, in Polish, "My tragedy".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 147 (loc. 2318).</ref> Sand, in a letter to Grzyma<U+0142>a of June 1838, admitted strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin; she asked Grzyma<U+0142>a to assess Chopin's relationship with Maria Wodzi<U+0144>ska, without realising that the affair, at least from Maria's side, was over.<ref>Chopin (1962), pp. 151<U+2013>161.</ref>

In June 1837 Chopin had made an incognito visit to London in the company of the piano manufacturer [[Camille Pleyel]] where he played at a musical soir<U+00E9>e at the house of [[James Broadwood]].<ref>Za<U+0142>uski (1992), p. 226</ref>  Returning to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, and by the end of June 1838 they had become lovers.<ref name="ReferenceB">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.) <U+00A7>3, para. 4.</ref> Sand, who was six years older than Chopin, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: "I must say I was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me&nbsp;... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away&nbsp;..."<ref>Cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 154 (loc. 2417).</ref> The two spent a miserable winter on [[Majorca]] (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the healths of Chopin and Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover [[F<U+00E9>licien Mallefille]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 159 (loc. 2514).</ref> However, after discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply religious people of Majorca became inhospitable,<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;161<U+2013>162 (locs. 2544<U+2013>2560).</ref> making accommodation difficult to find; this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Valldemossa]] which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

[[File:Eug<U+00E8>ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 041.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|George Sand sewing, by Delacroix, from his joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]]On 3 December, Chopin complained about his bad health and the incompetence of the doctors in Majorca: "Three doctors have visited me&nbsp;... The first said I was dead; the second said I was dying; and the third said I was about to die."<ref>cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 162 (loc. 2560).</ref> Chopin also had problems having his [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel piano]] sent to him. It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: "I am sending you my ''[[Preludes (Chopin)|Preludes]]'' [(Op. 28)]. I finished them on your little piano, which arrived in the best possible condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs."<ref name="ReferenceB"/> Chopin was also able to undertake work on his [[Ballades (Chopin)#Ballade No. 2|Ballade No. 2]], Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the [[Scherzo No. 3 (Chopin)|Scherzo No. 3]], Op. 39.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 168 (loc. 2646).</ref>

Although this period had been productive, the bad weather had such a detrimental effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 168 (loc. 2654)</ref>{{#tag:ref|Two neighbouring apartments at the Valldemossa monastery, each long hosting a Chopin museum, have been claimed to be the sojourning place of Chopin and Sand, and to hold Chopin's Pleyel piano.

The group traveled first to [[Barcelona]], then to [[Marseilles]], where they stayed for a few months while Chopin convalesced.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.) <U+00A7>3, para. 5.</ref> In May 1839 they headed to Sand's estate at [[Nohant-Vic|Nohant]] for the summer (where they spent most summers until 1846). In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment, at 5 rue Tronchet, was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. Chopin frequently visited Sand in the evenings, but both retained some independence.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.) <U+00A7>4, para. 1.</ref> At the funeral of the tenor [[Adolphe Nourrit]] in Paris 1839, Chopin made a rare appearance at the [[organ (music)|organ]], playing a transcription of [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[lied]]'' ''Die Gestirne''.<ref name="acquaintance"/> In 1842 Chopin and Sand moved to the [[Square d'Orl<U+00E9>ans]], living in adjacent buildings.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.) <U+00A7>4, para. 4.</ref>

During the summers at Nohant, particularly in the years 1839<U+2013>43, Chopin found quiet but productive days during which he composed many works. They included his [[Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53 (Chopin)|Polonaise in A-flat major]], Op. 53. Amongst the visitors to Nohant were Delacroix and the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[Pauline Viardot]], whom Chopin had advised on piano technique and composition.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 197 (loc. 3100).</ref> Delacroix gives an account of staying at Nohant in a letter of 7 June 1842:
<blockquote>The hosts could not be more pleasant in entertaining me.  When we are not all together at dinner, lunch, playing billiards, or walking, each of us stays in his room, reading or lounging around on a couch. Sometimes, through the window which opens on the garden. a gust of music wafts up from Chopin at work. All this mingles with the songs of nightingales and the fragrance of roses.<ref>Cited in Atwood (1999),  p. 315.</ref></blockquote>

===Final years===
[[File:Jane stirling par deveria.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Jane Stirling]], by [[Achille Dev<U+00E9>ria|Dev<U+00E9>ria]], c. 1830]]From 1845 Chopin's health continued to deteriorate. Recent research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Sara Reardon, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/31/AR2011013104713.html "Chopin's hallucinations may have been caused by epilepsy"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 31 January 2011, accessed 10 January 2014.</ref> A series of his letters dated from 1845 to 1848, now at the Warsaw Chopin Museum, describe his daily life during this period and the composition of  his [[Cello Sonata (Chopin)|Cello Sonata in G minor]].<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXk-FI8qDObmo-ABKXwYZyCaz_7w?docId=CNG.f562d238b750a565f6cd658dfd177857.2d1 "Long-lost Chopin letters revealed by Polish museum"], [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]], 24 March 2011, accessed 27 July 2013.</ref> Chopin's relations with Sand also soured, worsened in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and her fianc<U+00E9>, the young fortune-hunting sculptor [[Auguste Cl<U+00E9>singer]].<ref name="MichaowskiSamson">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>5, para.2.</ref> Chopin frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice.<ref>Samson (1996), p. 194.</ref> As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her "third child." In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a "child," a "little angel," a "sufferer" and a "beloved little corpse."<ref name="gredxn"/>

In 1847 Sand published her novel ''Lucrezia Floriani'', whose main characters<U+2014>a rich actress and a prince in weak health<U+2014>could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the [[galley proof|printer's galleys]]. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and Chopin quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made "a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship."<ref name="MichaowskiSamson" />

Chopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils. In February 1848 he gave his last Paris concert, with Franchomme, which included three movements of the Cello Sonata Op. 65. In April, with the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] underway in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and at numerous receptions in great houses.<ref name="gredxn"/> This tour was suggested to Chopin by his Scottish pupil [[Jane Stirling]] and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the necessary arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>5, para. 3.</ref>

In London Chopin took lodgings at [[Dover Street]], where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at [[Stafford House]], the audience included [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]; the Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] and the singer [[Jenny Lind]]. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] (<U+00A3>1.05 in present British currency) per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some his mazurkas to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] texts.<ref>Za<U+0142>uski (1992), pp. 227-9.</ref>

In late summer he was invited by Jane Stirling to visit Scotland, staying at Calder House near [[Edinburgh]] and at [[Johnstone Castle]] in [[Renfrewshire]], both owned by members of Stirling's family.<ref name="Chopin's Scottish autumn <U+2013> Frederick Chopin" /> Stirling clearly had a notion of going beyond mere friendship, and Chopin was obliged to make it clear to her that this could not be so. He wrote at this time to Grzyma<U+0142>a "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed."<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 279 (loc. 4385). Letter of 30 October 1848.</ref> Chopin gave a public concert in Glasgow on 27 September,<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 276<U+2013>8 (locs. 4340<U+2013>4357)</ref> and another in Edinburgh, at the Hopetoun Rooms on Queen Street (now Erskine House) on 4 October.<ref name="monuments" /> In late October 1848, while staying in Edinburgh, at 10 Warriston Crescent, with the Polish physician Adam <U+0141>yszczy<U+0144>ski, Chopin wrote out his last will and testament<U+2014>"a kind of disposition to be made of my stuff in the future, if I should drop dead somewhere," he wrote to Grzyma<U+0142>a.<ref name="gredxn"/>

Chopin made his last public appearance on a concert platform at London's [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] on 16 November 1848, when, in a final patriotic gesture, he played for the benefit of Polish refugees. He was at this time clearly seriously ill, weighing less than 45&nbsp;kg (99 pounds), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was in a terminal stage.<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>5, para. 4.">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>5, para. 4.</ref>

At the end of November, Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and [[Auguste Franchomme]]. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of [[Delfina Potocka]], for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in [[Chaillot]], out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 283<U+2013>6 (locs. 4446<U+2013>4487).</ref>

===Death and funeral===

In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter. In September 1849, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling,<ref>Zamoyski (2010) p. 288 (loc. 4512).</ref> Chopin took an apartment at [[Place Vend<U+00F4>me|Place Vend<U+00F4>me 12]]. After 15 October, when Chopin's condition took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although Viardot sardonically remarked that "all the grand Parisian ladies considered it ''[[de rigueur]]'' to faint in his room."<ref name="Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>5, para. 4."/>

Some of his friends provided music at his request; amongst them, Potocka sang and Franchomme played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw. He also bequeathed his unfinished piano method to Alkan for completion.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), 291<U+2013>3 (locations 4566<U+2013>4591).</ref> On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. "No longer", Chopin replied. He died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and Thomas Albrecht.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), 293 (loc. 4591).</ref> Later that morning, Solange's husband Cl<U+00E9>singer made Chopin's [[death mask]] and a cast of his left hand.

===Overview===
[[File:Chopinamqsop53.jpg|thumb|left|Autographed musical quotation from the Polonaise [[Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53 (Chopin)|Op. 53]], signed by Chopin on 25 May 1845]]Over 230 works of Chopin survive; some compositions from early childhood have been lost. All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s or [[chamber music]].

Chopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. Chopin cited Bach and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>6 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the "brilliant" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of Italian opera. Much of what became Chopin's typical ornamentation (e.g. his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|mode]]s and features (e.g. [[drone (music)|drones]]) of the music of his native country.<ref>Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.). <U+00A7>6, paras 1<U+2013>4.</ref>

Chopin took the new salon genre of the ''[[nocturne]]'', invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. Chopin was the first to write ''[[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]''<ref name="scholesballade"/> and ''[[scherzi]]'' as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing ''preludes'' (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert ''[[<U+00E9>tude]]'', already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304<U+2013>5</ref>

Chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's ''mazurkas'']], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; "it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map."<ref>Jones (1998b), 177</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|''polonaises'']] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op. 26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name="chopin13"/> Chopin's [[Waltzes (Chopin)|''waltzes'']] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref>Jones (1998a), 162.</ref>

===Form and harmony===

[[Fryderyk Chopin Museum]], Warsaw.]][[Musical improvisation|Improvisation]] stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes: however, this does not imply impulsive rambling<U+2014>"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form."<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 298.</ref> The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be "merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing&nbsp;... formally longwinded and extremely conservative."<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 305.</ref> After the early piano concerti (both dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure."<ref name="Hutchings 1968, p. 137">Hutchings (1968), p. 137.</ref> Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar [[phrase (music)|phrase]] as a structural unit.<ref>Rosen (1995), pp.&nbsp;262<U+2013>278.</ref>

J. Barrie Jones suggests that "amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme", and adds that "the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] op. 60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody."<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161<U+2013>2.</ref> Nicholas Temperley explains that in these works, based on an extended 'departure and return' form, and with "immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail", "the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes."<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>

Chopin's ''Mazurkas'' and ''Waltzes'' are basically all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The ''Mazurkas'' often show more 'folky' features than much of Chopin's other works, sometimes including [[mode (music)|modal]] scales and harmonies and the use of [[drone (music)|drone basses]]. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op. 63 No. 3, which includes a [[canon (music)|canon]] at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.<ref>Jones (1998b), pp.&nbsp;177<U+2013>9.</ref>

[[<U+00C9>tudes (Chopin)|Chopin's ''<U+00C9>tudes'']] are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name="Jones 1998a, p. 160">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used his ''<U+00C9>tudes'' to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name="rjsfih"/><U+2014>for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] (Op. 25, No. 6), playing in octaves (Op. 25, No. 10), and playing repeated notes (Op. 10, No. 7).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160<U+2013>161.</ref>

His [[Preludes (Chopin)|''Pr<U+00E9>ludes'']], many of which are very brief, some of them consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure, were described by Schumann as "the beginnings of studies."<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J. S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's chromatic sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by Chopin and later pianists as generic preludes to other pieces by Chopin, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] has noted in a recording by [[Feruccio Busoni]] of 1922, or even by other composers.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101<U+2013>2.</ref>

The two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No. 2]], Op. 35, written in 1839 and [[Piano Sonata No. 3 (Chopin)|No. 3]], Op. 58, written in 1844) are both in four movements, In Op. 35, Chopin "used the sonata genre as a framework within which the achievements of his earlier music <U+2013> the figurative patterns of the <U+00E9>tudes and preludes, the cantilenas of the nocturnes, and even the periodicity of the dance pieces <U+2013> might be drawn together&nbsp;... a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle."<ref name="ReferenceC">Micha<U+0142>owski and Samson (n.d.), <U+00A7>9 para. 2.</ref> The last movement, a brief (75-bar) [[perpetuum mobile]] in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann.<ref>Rosen (1995), pp.&nbsp;294<U+2013>7.</ref> The Op. 58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex [[counterpoint]] "worthy of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]."<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

Chopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. "Novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. [[Chord progression]]s sometimes anticipate the shifting [[tonality]] of later composers such as [[Claude Debussy]], as does Chopin's use of [[mode (music)|modal]] harmony.<ref>Temperley (1980), pp.&nbsp;302<U+2013>3.</ref>

===Titles, opus numbers and editions===
[[File:Chopin polonaise Op. 53.jpg|thumb|Chopin's autograph of first 32 bars of [[Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53 (Chopin)|Polonaise in A-flat major]], 1842]]Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, e.g. the ''[[<U+00C9>tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|Revolutionary <U+00C9>tude]]'' (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1) However, Chopin never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extra-musical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref name="ReferenceA">Hedley (2005), p. 264.</ref><ref>Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary <U+00C9>tude'' was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata within which it is contained; but the exact occasion is not known. It appears not to have been inspired by any specific personal bereavement.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4<U+2013>8.</ref>

The last opus number that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the [[Cello Sonata (Chopin)|Cello Sonata in G minor]]. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66<U+2013>73), published in 1855.<ref name="Piano Society"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name="Classical Archives"/>

Works published since 1857 have received alternate catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobylanska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla<U+0144>ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ "What does the "KK" Mean?"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21.12.2013.</ref>

===Chopin's technique and performance style===
[[File:Op 62-1ms.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Extract from Chopin Nocturne op. 62 no. 1 (1846) (composer's manuscript).]][[File:Chopin op 62-1 pr.png|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The same passage (1881 [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]] edition). The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]] Chopin's style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique. In his projected but uncompleted piano methodology, ''"Projet de m<U+00E9>thode"'', he wrote: "Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm."<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further noted: "One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity."<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this attitude to technique in Chopin's music include as characteristics the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (e.g. four against three) by the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18<U+2013>20.</ref>

[[Jonathan Bellman]] notes that modern concert performance style<U+2014>set in the "[[music school|conservatory]]" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria and/or recordings<U+2014>militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149<U+2013>50</ref> Chopin himself is quoted as saying to a pupil that "concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art."<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that Chopin in performance avoided rigid procedures, sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as "always crescendo to a high note", but was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153<U+2013>4</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853: "[Chopin] has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn."<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that "What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers."<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154</ref>

Chopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'' (i.e. divergence from strict rhythm). There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] points out that <blockquote>most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil, [[Carl Mikuli|Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref></blockquote>

Another Chopin pupil, Friederike M<U+00FC>ller, wrote:
<blockquote>[Chopin's] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was "He<U+2014>or she<U+2014>does not know how to join two notes together." He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[ritardando]]s''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.<ref name="nifc14"/>

===Polish heritage in Chopin's music===
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; font-size: 85%; margin-left: 0em; margin-right: 0em; margin:10px; background:#F0E68C; color:black; width:40em; max-width: 25%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" |
The 'Polish character' of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas (<U+2026>) which forms (<U+2026>) were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside. Through the absolute 'musicality' of his works he loomed large above his period in two ways: as an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation that transcended history. For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of 'national music' <U+2013> an inspired solution to his art <U+2013> was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland (<U+2026>) and were raised to the pinnacle of all human art. Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.
|-
| style="text-align: left; font-size: 85%;" |[[Karol Szymanowski]], (1923)<ref>cited in Downes (2001), p. 63</ref>
|}With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of [[nationalism]]. Schumann, in his 1836 review of Chopin's piano concertos, highlighted Chopin's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that "Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 rising]]], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... [I]f the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e., Tsar Alexander I] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The influential biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne von Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856<U+2013>61.</ref> claims that Chopin "must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation."<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>
 
However, some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a "nationalist" or "patriotic" composer. George Golos adverts to earlier "nationalist" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha<U+0142> Kleofas Ogi<U+0144>ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439<U+2013>42.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from Warsaw "urbanised" versions than from [[folk music]], and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113<U+2013>21.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising <ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344<U+2013>45.</ref> and notes that non-Poles' ambivalence toward the idea of Polish nationalism in Chopin's compositions persists: "[Chopin] felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely" but consciously modeled his works on the tradition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], Beethoven, [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361<U+2013>63.</ref>

A reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Attwood: "Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;..."<ref>Attwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>

Jones comments that "Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote for the piano, has rarely been questioned."<ref name="Jones 1998a, p. 160"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831<U+2014>"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons"<U+2014>and these factors as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref> Whilst his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir<U+00E9>es), "his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional" amongst his romantic contemporaries.<ref name="Hutchings 1968, p. 137"/> Such traits marked him off from many of his more showy pianist contemporaries in Paris such as Liszt and [[Henri Herz]].

His qualities as a pianist and composer were, however, recognized by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'' (Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann). Liszt was at Chopin's Paris debut and appeared with him in two concerts in 1833. His performance of Chopin's Op. 10 <U+00C9>tudes was admired by the composer, who wrote to Hiller "I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies", although the friendship between the two was often uneasy. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref>Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk-music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.<ref>Conway (2012), pp. 229<U+2013>30.</ref>

Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821<U+2013>1897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of Chopin's playing to their own students, some of whom (e.g. [[Raoul Koczalski]]) were to make recordings of Chopin's music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk|Louis Gottschalk]], <U+00C9>douard Wolff (1816<U+2013>1880) and Pierre Zimmermann.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 150<U+2013>51.</ref> Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano ''[[<U+00C9>tudes (Debussy)|<U+00C9>tudes]]'' to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.<ref>Wheeldon (2009), pp. 55, 62.</ref>

Polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as [[Moritz Moszkowski]], but his "one worthy successor" amongst his compatriots was [[Karol Szymanowski]] (1882<U+2013>1937).<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 180.</ref> [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Anton<U+00ED>n Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k]], [[Isaac Alb<U+00E9>niz]], [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], among others, have been assessed as influenced by Chopin's use of national modes and idioms.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 307.</ref>
In the 20th century, composers who paid homage to (or in some cases parodied) the music of Chopin included [[George Crumb]], [[Bohuslav Martin<U+016F>]], [[Darius Milhaud]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref>Mariola Wojtkiewicz, tr. Jerzy Ossowski, [http://www.chopin.pl/reception_works.en.html "The Impact of Chopin's Music on the Work of 19th and 20th Century Composers"], in chopin.pl website, accessed 4 January 2014.</ref>

Chopin's music was also utilised in the 1909 [[ballet]] ''[[Les Sylphides|Chopiniana]]'', choreographed by [[Michel Fokine]], using orchestrations by [[Alexander Glazunov]]. Further orchestrations were commissioned from Stravinsky, [[Anatoly Lyadov]], [[Sergei Taneyev]] and [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] for later productions (using the title ''Les Sylphides'').<ref>Taruskin (1996), pp.&nbsp;546<U+2013>7.</ref>

Chopin's music remains popular and is regularly performed, recorded and broadcast. The world's oldest monographic music competition, the [[International Chopin Piano Competition]], founded in 1927, is held every five years in Warsaw.<ref>[http://konkurs.chopin.pl/en/about/competition "About Competition"], International Chopin Competition website, accessed 12 January 2014.</ref> The Fryderyk Chopin Institute of Poland lists on its website over eighty societies world-wide devoted to the composer and his music.<ref>[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/search/cat/1/page/1 "Institutions related to Chopin&nbsp;<U+2013> Associations"], Fryderik Chopin Institute website, accessed 5 January 2014.</ref> The Institute site also lists nearly 1500 performances of works of Chopin on [[YouTube]] as of January 2014.<ref>[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/youtube/search "Chopin on YouTube"], Fryderik Chopin Institute website, accessed 5 January 2014.</ref>

==Recordings==
The [[British Library]] notes that "Chopin's works have been recorded by all the great pianists of the recording era." The earliest recording was an 1895 performance by [[Pavel Pabst|Paul Pabst]] of the Nocturne in E major Op. 62 No. 2. The British Library site makes available a number of historic recordings, including some by Paderewski, [[Xaver Scharwenka]], [[Alfred Cortot]], [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], [[Ignaz Friedman]], [[Artur Rubinstein]], [[Vladimir Horowitz]] and many others.<ref>[http://sounds.bl.uk/classical-music/chopin "Chopin"], British Library website, accessed 22.12.2013. Recordings accessible free online throughout the [[European Union]].</ref>

There are presently numerous recordings available of Chopin's works. On the occasion of the composer's bicentenary, the critics of ''[[The New York Times]]'' recommended performances by the following contemporary pianists (amongst many others):<ref>[[Anthony Tommasini]] et al., [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/arts/music/28chopinweb.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 "1 Composer, 2 Centuries, Many Picks"], ''The New York Times'', 27 May 2010, accessed 28 December 2013.</ref> [[Krystian Zimerman]], [[Murray Perahia]], [[Emanuel Ax]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], [[Martha Argerich]], [[Maurizio Pollini]], and [[Evgeny Kissin]].

==Chopin in literature, stage, film and television==
Chopin has figured extensively in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies of his life and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 [[sonnet]] on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Andr<U+00E9> Gide]]; and he has also featured in works of [[Gottfried Benn]] and [[Boris Pasternak]].<ref>Andrzej Hejmej, tr. Philip Stoeckle, [http://www.chopin.pl/chopin_literature.en.html "Chopin and his music in literature"], in chopin.pl website, accessed 4 January 2014.</ref> There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English. (See "Bibliography" below for some of these.)
 
Possibly the first venture into fictional treatments of Chopin's life was a fanciful operatic version of some of its events. ''Chopin'' was written by [[Giacomo Orefice]] and produced in Milan in 1901. All the music is derived from that of Chopin.<ref>G<U+00F6>ran Forsling, [http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=572911 Giacomo Orefice: Chopin], on ArkivMusik website, accessed 25 August 2013.</ref>

Chopin's life and his relations with George Sand have been fictionalized in numerous films. The 1945 [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[A Song to Remember]]'' earned [[Cornel Wilde]] an [[Academy Award]] nomination as [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for his portrayal of the composer. Other film treatments have included: ''La valse de l'adieu'' (France, 1928) by [[Henry Roussel]], with [[Pierre Blanchar]] as Chopin; ''[[Impromptu (1991 film)|Impromptu]]'' (1991), starring [[Hugh Grant]] as Chopin; ''La note bleue'' (1991); and ''[[Chopin: Desire for Love]]'' (2002).<ref>Iwona Sowi<U+0144>ska, tr. Philip Stoeckle, [http://www.chopin.pl/chopin_films.en.html#1 "Chopin goes to the movies"], in chopin.pl website, accessed 4 January 2014. The site gives details of numerous other films featuring Chopin.</ref> In [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Autumn Sonata]]'', the difference in interpreting Chopin's Prelude No. 2 in A minor between pianist Charlotte Andergast and her daughter Eva constitutes a major scene.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/333800%7C0/Autumn-Sonata.html ''Autumn Sonata''], [[Turner Classic Movies]] website, accessed 25 August 2013.</ref>
