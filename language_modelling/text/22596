'''Orson''' is a [[Local government in Pennsylvania#Village|village]] in [[Preston Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania|Preston Township]], [[Wayne County, Pennsylvania|Wayne County]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. It was once an important [[Train station|depot]] along the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway#History|New York, Ontario & Western (O&W) Railway]]'s Scranton Line, but today, when it is known outside of its immediate vicinity, it is largely as the intersection of two important state roads, [[Pennsylvania Route 370|PA Route 370]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 670|PA Route 670]], or as the location of Independent Lake Camp,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://independentlake.com/|title=Independent Lake Camp|author=1.I.L., Inc. (d/b/a Independent Lake Camp)|date=2014|website=Independent Lake Camp|publisher=1.I.L., Inc. (d/b/a Independent Lake Camp)|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> since that business, like most rural [[Summer camp#United States|American summer camps]], caters to a clientele that extends beyond Orson.
==Municipal status==
A [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|PennDOT]] sign on Route 370 identifies this locality as the "Village of Orson." "Village" is Pennsylvania's designation for an unincorporated community within a township, but PennDOT identifies most villages with [[Local government in Pennsylvania#Village|roadside signs]], a fact that might reasonably lead those unfamiliar with this practice to believe that these communities are [[Municipal corporation|incorporated municipalities]]. Therefore, it should be emphasized that Pennsylvania's villages, including Orson, are not municipalities in their own right.
==History==
The community known today as Orson was founded by Merritt Hine (some sources say "Merrill Hine"<ref>{{cite book|last=Goodrich|first=Phineas G.|date=1992|origyear=1880|title=History of Wayne County|location=Baltimore|publisher=Gateway Press, Inc.|page=244}}</ref>) of [[Woodbridge, Connecticut]] in 1840.<ref name="Commemorative Biographical Record">{{cite book|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Commemorative Biographical Record of Northeastern Pennsylvania|location=Chicago|publisher=J.H.

On December 25, 1878, Orson C. Chamberlain, a great-grandchild of Merritt Hine, died of [[diphtheria]] in an epidemic that affected many in Preston Township.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=From Another Correspondent|newspaper=The Wayne Independent|location=Honesdale, PA|date=9 January 1879}}</ref> The community came to be known as Orson in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=30701008|title=Orson Chamberlain|last=Ann|first=Merry|date=20 October 2008|website=Find A Grave|publisher=Jim Tipton|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> The Hines Corners Post Office was renamed "Orson Post Office" on September 19th, 1896.<ref name="USPS"/>

When the O&W Railway expanded its service to [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] in 1890, it created several depots in rural Wayne County, one of which was located in Orson and was referred to either as such or by the name of another small community, Belmont, which was located slightly to the south of Orson in [[Mount Pleasant Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania|Mount Pleasant Township]], near the intersection of Routes [[Pennsylvania Route 371|371]] and 670, now called Belmont Corners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.west2k.com/pastations/waynepa.shtml|title=Wayne County Pennsylvania Railroad Stations|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=2014|website=Pennsylvania Railroad Stations Past & Present|publisher=Dan West|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> The Orson/Belmont depot was located approximately at what is now the intersection of Routes 370 and 670; its construction caused the community to move slightly southwards in order to take advantage of the new [[Rail transportation in the United States|railroad]].<ref name="Steffen"/> While it has never been exceptionally populous, the community has been home to four [[Education in the United States|public schools]], two [[Creamery|creameries]], the aforementioned post office (which was placed under [[Discontinued post office|suspension]] on May 9th, 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savethepostoffice.com/post-offices-under-suspension-%E2%80%A8112012|title=Post Offices Under Suspension (as of <U+2028>1/1/2012)|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=3 February 2012|website=Save the Post Office|publisher=Steve Hutkins|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>), a [[Sawmill|sawmill]], a [[Gristmill|grain mill]], and several hotels and stores, as well as other establishments, throughout its history, largely in order to serve the influx of people brought to Orson by the railroad.<ref name="Steffen"/>

The Scranton Line was abandoned in 1957 following the closure of the O&W, largely marking the end of Orson's supra-regional importance. Many of Orson's business establishments closed soon after the railroad did, with the exception of the summer camps that would gradually come to replace the railroad as Orson's main source of supra-regional notability. The first of these was Camp Keeyumah, a [[Judaism|Jewish]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Kuttler|first=Hillel|date=18 March 2014|title=From Jewish sleepaway camp to the big-time courts, Larry Brown leads the way|url=http://www.jta.org/2014/03/18/arts-entertainment/sports/from-jewish-sleepaway-camp-to-the-big-time-courts-larry-brown-leads-the-way|newspaper=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|location=Baltimore|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> camp which operated from 1949 to 1974<ref>{{cite news|last=Kornheiser|first=Tony|date=20 June 2001|title=Camp Reunion Paunchy, Poignant|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jun/20/news/cl-12521|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> and was situated on the banks of Independent Lake. In 1981<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campwestmont.com/|title=Camp Westmont|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Camp Westmont|publisher=Camp Westmont, Inc.|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>, Camp Westmont opened on the same site, and maintained most of the same facilities until 1991, when it moved its operations across the lake to [[Poyntelle, Pennsylvania|Poyntelle]], where it currently operates. The same year, the aforementioned Independent Lake Camp opened in its place. Independent Lake Camp occupied this area until 2003, when it expanded to include previously undeveloped land to the south of the lakefront.

Today, Orson is home to three year-round businesses: the Orson Country Inn<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Orson-Country-Inn/104674559566287|title=Orson Country Inn|author=Orson Country Inn, Inc.|date=22 September 2011|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook, Inc.|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> (which is often referred to as the Orson Inn or simply "the O" by locals), Orson Corners Veterinary Clinic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/101105972706679109356/about|title=Orson Corners Veterinary Clinic|author=Orson Corners Veterinary Clinic|website=Google+|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> and Orson's Best Garden Center And Farmstand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OrsonsBest|title=Orson<U+2019>s Best Garden Center and Farmstand|author=Orson<U+2019>s Best Garden Center and Farmstand|date=1 November 2014|website=Facebook|publisher=Facebook, Inc.|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> It is also the location of one seasonal business, the previously mentioned Independent Lake Camp, also known as "ILC," which operates from the second-to-last Sunday in June until the last Sunday in August. In addition, a stretch of the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway|PA O&W Trail]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traillink.com/trail/ow-trail---pa.aspx|title=O&W Trail <U+2013> PA|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=2014|website=TrailLink|publisher=Rails-to-Trails Conservancy|accessdate=4 November 2014}}</ref> part of the [[Rails-to-Trails Conservancy]], runs through Orson.
==Education==
As noted above, Orson has been home to a series of four schools over the course of its history. The first and second were situated in what was then Hine's Corners, and were both located along what is today Oxbow Road near what is now Clark Road, the first on the south side of Clark Road and the second on its north side. They existed from 1860 to around 1872 and from around 1872 to around 1890, respectively; both were referred to simply as "Hine's Corners School."<ref name="Steffen"/> The final two were both located in Orson-proper, on Oxbow Road between Clark and Route 370, adjacent to Orson Church, the third pushed back significantly from the road. The former of these two operated from around 1890 to 1924, while the latter was open from 1924 to 1956; both were generally referred to as "Orson School,"<ref name="Steffen"/> although at least one source refers to the fourth school as "Simpson School."<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Section C|newspaper=The Wayne Independent|location=Honesdale, PA|date=4 February 1978}}</ref> The building that once housed this last school is still standing and has been converted into a private residence.<ref name="Steffen"/>

Today, Orson, along with the rest of Preston Township, is part of the [[Wayne Highlands School District]], and is located in [[Wayne Highlands School District#Region I|Region I]] of that district. The closest school is the [[Wayne Highlands School District#Schools|Preston Area School]] in nearby [[Lakewood, Pennsylvania|Lakewood]], which serves children grades [[K-8 School|K-8]]. For [[Secondary education in the United States#High school|high school]]-aged students, [[Honesdale High School]] serves the entire district. There are also several [[Private school#United States|private]] and [[Parochial school#United States & Canada|parochial]] schools in the area, but all are outside of Preston Township.

==Human features==
Orson is centered around the intersection<U+2013>sometimes called "Orson Corners"<U+2013>of Crosstown Highway (part of Route 370) and Belmont Turnpike (part of Route 670), the latter of which begins at this intersection; the paved road extending north of 670 from the intersection is known locally as Oxbow Road. Other roads in Orson include Clark Road, which connects to Oxbow Road and Route 370; Doyle Road, which connects to Route 370 and Clark Road; and Hines Road, which connects to Clark Road; Clark, Doyle, and Hines Roads are all unpaved.
