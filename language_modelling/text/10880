'''Carlos Amaral Freire''' is a [[Brazil]]ian scholar, [[Linguistics|linguist]] and [[translation|translator]]. He has mastered more than 30 languages in the sense that he has some theoretical and practical knowledge that makes it possible for him to communicate in them, but he can make translations, read, and write in others. He has studied more than a hundred twenty languages, but he has half-forgotten many of them, which would need a little study to come back in conversation skills. He still studies two new languages each year.

Freire's ''Babel de Poemas'' is a polylingual [[anthology]] with translations of poems from 60 languages.
