'''Jan Christian Smuts''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Companion of Honour|CH]], [[ED]], [[King's Counsel|KC]], [[Royal Society|FRS]] ([[May 24]], [[1870]] &ndash; [[September 11]], [[1950]]) was a prominent [[South Africa]]n and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[statesman]], military leader, and philosopher.  He served as a Boer [[General]] during the Boer War, a British General during the First World War and was appointed [[Field Marshal]] by [[King George VI]] during the Second World War.  In addition to various [[cabinet]] appointments, he served as [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] of the [[Union of South Africa]] from 1919 until 1924 and from 1939 until 1948.  From 1917 to 1919 he was one of five members of the British [[War Cabinet]], helping to create the [[Royal Air Force]]. He played a leading part in the post-war settlements at the end of both world wars, making significant contributions towards the creation of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]].  He did much to redefine the relationship between Britain and the Dominions and Colonies, leading to the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]].

Jan Smuts was born in 1870, the second son of a traditional [[Boer]] farming family. By rural tradition, the eldest son would be the only child to receive a  full formal education; however, on the death of his elder brother in 1882, 12-year-old Jan was sent to school for the first time. After four years of education he had made exceptional progress, gaining admission to study at [[Victoria College]] in [[Stellenbosch]].  He graduated in 1891 with first-class honours in Literature and Science. With this strong academic background, he applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study, electing to read Law at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]]. After further academic success, and the recipient of many prestigious academic awards, he graduated in 1894 with double First-class honours.  After graduating, Smuts passed the examinations for the [[Inns of Court]], entering the [[Middle Temple]]. In 1895, despite the prospect of a bright future in the [[United Kingdom]], the homesick Smuts returned to South Africa.

==In South Africa==
===Childhood===
[[Image:Jan Smuts early life map.png|thumb|250px|right|Smuts was born and raised in the district of Malmesbury, in the British [[Cape Colony]].]]
Jan Christiaan Smuts was born into a prosperous [[Afrikaner]] family at the family farm, Bovenplaats, in the district of [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]], [[Cape Colony]]. He was the second son in a family of four sons and two daughters. His family were of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent on his father's side, and of [[Huguenot]] descent on his mother's side.

The Smuts family was well-established in the area.  His father, Jacobus Abraham, was a man of local prominence, a pillar of the church, and a leading figure in the social and political affairs of the area.  He was later to be elected as the member for Malmesbury in the Cape Colony legislature.<ref>^ WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.5</ref> Smuts's mother, Catherina Petronella, was the sister of the local [[predikant]] (minister of religion in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]). She was a woman of considerable education and culture (at least according to the standards of the area) having studied music and French at college in [[Cape Town]].

In 1878, when Jan was eight, the family moved from Bovenplaats, where they had been living on the family farm with Jacobus Smuts's father, to a newly inherited farm at Klipfontein - some 13 miles away.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.15</ref> 

The Smuts family were traditional Afrikaner farmers.  As such, questions of property and family affairs were governed extensively by custom. This dictated that it was on the first son that the family expectations fell; it was he that the family would put through a course of formal education, to enable him to enter into one of the professions.  As for the others, they would be put to work on the farm whilst receiving a rudimentary home education.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.8</ref> As the second son, this was to be Jan's role.  His elder brother, Michiel, was sent to school, destined for a future as a predikant in the Dutch Reformed Church.
[[Image:JanSmutsFamily.png|thumb|250px|left|Jacobus and Catherina Smuts, 1893]]
Farmwork combined with education from his mother <U+2014> this was the order of Jan's life for the next few years.  In his early years he accompanied the family servants on their day to day work.  As he followed them around, talking to them and helping as best he could, he learned both about farmwork and of the flora and fauna of the surrounding countryside.  Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility on the farm was as a herd, first of the pigs and poultry and later of the cattle.  Custom dictated that this work would have its benefits; Jan was entitled to a share of the natural increase of the beasts under his care.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.8</ref>  During this time, he built up a respectable holding of livestock.  In his spare time he went for long, solitary walks, exploring the area surrounding Klipfontein; expeditions which led to a life-long love of the countryside and its natural beauty.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.12</ref> 

In ordinary circumstances Jan Smuts would have, in time, taken over the running of the farm, spending his life as a farmer, as his father, grandfather and great-grandfather had before him.  However this was not to be; a new turn of events was to change this destiny.

===Schooldays===

In 1882 Jan's elder brother died of typhoid.  Jan was now the eldest son and the family looked to him to assume his brother's position.  Jan was immediately sent to school in the nearby town of [[Riebeek West]].  At twelve years of age Jan was physically slight with a delicate and reserved disposition.  He had lived all his life in a conservative, pious, and rural Afrikaner environment.  He spoke only Afrikaans.  Hitherto, his education had been rudimentary (although thanks to his mother's culture, it was superior to others in his position) and he was starting school far later than his contemporaries.

Despite these disadvantages, Jan proved himself an outstanding scholar.  After only three years of study, he had made sufficient progress to overtake most of  his peers - children with up to eleven years of formal education.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.15</ref>  When he came to sit the Cape Colony elementary examination, he was placed ninth in the entire colony.  The next year, sitting the School Higher examinations, Jan bettered even this - he was placed second on the Cape lists.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.11</ref>

Jan's time at school set the future direction of his life. It was here that he developed his lifelong zeal for hard work and reading, an enthusiasm bordering on mania during these early years.  A few weeks before the School Higher exams, he fell ill and was ordered to bed by his doctor for a complete rest, with an absolute ban on study and books. Despite the doctor's instructions, Jan made strenuous efforts to obtain all the books that he could. One story told of him during this enforced convalescance describes how he used to bribe the headmaster's youngest son to bring him books. The subterfuge was successful until a visitor, in fact the headmaster's wife, hoping to ease his obvious discomfort, insisted on making his bed for him. To her astonishment, she discovered that the reason for his restlessness was not due to his illness, but to the immense pile of books he was concealing under his bedclothes!<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.11</ref> 

At the age of sixteen, Jan embarked on the next stage of his education; his headmaster entered him for the entrance exam for [[Stellenbosch University|Victoria College]], a prominent Afrikaans college in [[Stellenbosch]]. He passed, and joined Victoria College in 1886.

===Victoria College===
[[Image:IsieKrige1888.png|thumb|250px|right|Isie Krige, 1888]]
At Victoria College, Jan faced similar problems to those that he faced at school. He was reclusive and addicted to his studies. Perhaps the best indication of Jan's personality at this time comes from a letter he wrote just prior to enrolling, to a tutor there, Dr C Murray:

{{cquote|... such a place [Stellenbosch], where a large puerile element exists, affords fair scope for moral, and what is more important, religious temptation, which, if yielded to will eclipse alike the expectations of my parents and the intentions of myself ... for of what use will a mind, enlarged and refined in all possible ways, be to me, if my religion be a deserted pilot and morality a wreck?<ref>Smuts to C Murray, 12 June 1886, Selections from the Smuts Papers (hereafter SP) vol.1, p.4</ref>}}

Given these attitudes, it is unsurprising that Jan spent his five years in Stellenbosch largely aloof from the "puerile element" - that is to say from his peers.  Without social outlet, he buried himself in his work. He taught himself [[Dutch language|High Dutch]].  He immersed himself in [[German language|German]] and in the works of the German [[Romanticism|romantics]], whilst learning [[Ancient Greek]], so that he could study the [[classics]].  On Sundays, he attended both morning and evening church services and conducted a Bible study class for coloured boys.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.15</ref>  During the week, he also found time to regularly attend prayer meetings.  Physically, he continued to find refreshment in long, solitary walks.

However, Stellenbosch began to round some of the sharp edges in Jan's character; during his time there, he began to cast off some of his shyness.  Here he met Isie Krige, with whom he fell in love.  She adored him, and revered him for his intellect.  He was happy with having any female acquaintance, especially someone who gave him self-confidence.

He joined the local militia and began to write for the college magazine - for the first time beginning to consider the major political issues confronting South Africa.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.31</ref>

====Political awakening====

While at Stellenbosch, he became leader of the college debating society; in this role he was called upon to make the speech of welcome to [[Cecil Rhodes]], on the occasion of his visit to the college in 1888. Rhodes, on the verge of becoming Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, was an enthusiastic proponent of a wider Southern African union and the extension of British dominion in Africa.  It was fitting therefore that Smuts, whose thoughts had begun to develop along the very same lines, should deliver the welcome address on the theme of Pan-Africanism.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.19</ref> 

Smuts had been thinking along these lines throughout his time at Stellenbosch.  These emerging political views developed in tandem with his personal system of philosophy - ideas which he was later to develop into the philosophy of holism.  Smuts wrote two political essays during this time, essays which already betray the influence of one holism's key concepts - the realisation of inherent unity.  

The first essay was written in 1890.  Entitled'' 'South African Customs Union'''<ref>Essay, 1891, SP vol.1, p.15</ref>, it was entered for the JB Ebden prize offered by the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]].  The essay, conisting of some sixty pages of closely written foolscap, was 'highly commended', but failed to win the prize.  In this essay, Smuts considered the economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa - relations which were often beset by arguments and petty jealousies.  Smuts's overarching conclusion was that:

{{cquote|No policy in any Colony or state is sound, which does not recognise, and frame its measures as much as possible in accordance with the fact that South Africa is one, that consisting as it does of separate parts, it yet forms one commercial and moral unity.}} 

In this essay, Smuts examined the existing economic arrangements of South Africa, attempting to illustrate the weaknesses of existing arrangements - weaknesses which were to the disadvantage of all of South Africa.  Smuts pressed the advantages of economic union as being self-evidently superior.  Smuts had considered the realisation of the inherent commercial unity of South Africa, in his next important essay he considered moral unity.

In '' 'The Conditions of Future South African Literature'''<ref>Essay, 1892, SP vol.1, p.41</ref> Smuts considered the cultural and emotional elements which would be necessary, in addition to commercial union, for the realisation of South Africa's inherent unity.  Smuts considered the chief barrier to be the relations between the traditionalist Afrikaners and the new British immigrants.    Smuts urged the Britons to integrate with the existing population, and the Afrikaners to accept the new dynamism that the immigrants were injecting.  In Smuts's view, such consolidation was vital, both for the sake of a future South African nation and for the survival of the white populations in the face of the vastly greater African population.

Smuts's views were of limited importance, for the time being.  These were merely schoolboy essays which, although cogently argued, suffered from many analytical faults.  Nevertheless, the themes within them served as the long-term bedrock of Smuts's politics.

In 1891, he graduated with First-class honours in Literature and Science. He applied for, and won, the Ebden scholarship for overseas study.  He left the Cape to read Law at [[Cambridge University]].

==Spreading his wings==
===Cambridge===
Jan went to study at [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]], [[Cambridge]], a bastion of academia at the heart of the [[British Empire]]. In later years, he was to write:

{{cquote|At Cambridge, I read much, walked much and thought much; and when I left the University I had probably drunk as deeply of the well of knowledge as most ... I did not, however, mix much in the social life of the place.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.21</ref>}} 
[[Image:ChristsCollege Gate.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Christ's College, Cambridge.]]
Smuts came to Cambridge at the age of twenty-one, three or more years older than his fellow undergraduates.  He was isolated from the other men of his year by a different social background, upbringing and attitudes. He maintained his disdain for the 'puerile element' from his days in Stellenbosch. During his first term at Cambridge, Smuts suffered from tremendous homesickness, describing himself as being "utterly desolate".<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.33</ref>

In spite of Smuts's loneliness, he had not been without social opportunities.  During his first term, he received and accepted invitations to join the debating society and to write for the college magazine.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.34</ref>  However, he did not follow up the opportunities for friendship which these activities put in his way. Smuts's shyness was undoubtedly a factor in this, however perhaps the dominant cause was that Smuts was living in poverty, he lacked the money to repay the hospitality of others.<ref>K Ingham, Smuts: The Conscience of a South African, p.9</ref> 

Smuts was a recipient of the Ebden scholarship which typically paid some <U+00A3>200 per year.  However, due to a bank failure, Smuts was awarded only <U+00A3>100. Before leaving the Cape, Smuts sold the holding of livestock which he had accumulated from the family farm. This money paid his sea passage and left him with a modest sum to bank. Nevertheless, he soon discovered that even  essential undergraduate expenses were beyond his resources. Smuts wrote to the trustees of the Ebden fund, but was told that nothing could be done. In desperation, he wrote, bemoaning his situation, to a friend from his time at Stellenbosch, Professor JI Marais, lecturer in Theology. Professor Marais immediately replied, enclosing a cheque for <U+00A3>50 and urging Smuts to approach him whenever he found himself in need.<ref>JI Marais to Smuts, 8 Aug 1892, SP vol.1, p.25</ref> Marais continued to advance money towards Smuts throughout his time at Cambridge; in return, Smuts took out a life insurance policy, naming Marais as beneficiary.

With his financial situation more secure, Smuts found himself able to enter more into the social arena of the university. He ceased to be lonely, making acquaintances chiefly amongst the other colonial students.<ref>WK Hancock, Smuts: 1. The Sanguine Years, p.42</ref> He went on frequent walking expeditions, both with these friends and alone. Although he ceased to be lonely, he remained extremely serious and dedicated to his work; an attitude which perhaps was the main barrier between him and the English undergraduates.

At Cambridge, Smuts nurtured his passion for [[literature]], reading widely from sources that had not been available to him, even at Victoria College. He was enthralled by the [[romanticism|romantics]] and [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]]. His favourite author was the [[United States of America|American]] [[poet]] [[Walt Whitman]]. So great was Whitman's impact upon Smuts that the student wrote a book on Whitman, but it remained [[publishing|unpublished]] until Smuts's fame had made it inevitable. However, the effect manifested itself more evidently in Smuts's [[idealism]], and his later work, ''[[Holism and Evolution]]'', which drew greatly from the [[transcendentalism|transcendental]] movement.

In addition to extra-curricular studies, Smuts also excelled at Law. He achieved the unique distinction of attempting both parts of the Law Tripos in the same year and passing with First-class honours. He won many academic awards and accolades. In 1893, he won the prestigious [[George Long]] prize in Roman Law and Jurisprudence; a particular honour given that the prize was very rarely awarded as the required high academic standard was rarely met.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.23</ref>

===Aftermath===
Smut's tutor, Professor [[Frederic William Maitland|FW Maitland]], himself one of the most eminent legal scholars of the time, described Smuts as the most brilliant law student he had ever taught, providing Smuts with a glowing testemonial.<ref>FW Maitland to Smuts, 15 June 1894, SP vol.1, pp.33<U+2013>34</ref> With his brilliant academic record and endorsements such as this Smuts's future was bright.

In 1894, he passed the examinations for the [[Inns of Court]], entering the [[Middle Temple]].  The possibility of a distinguished legal career was now before him. His old college, Christ's College, offered him a fellowship in Law, but Smuts turned it down.<ref>JC Smuts, Jan Christian Smuts, p.24</ref> Instead, by June 1895, he was back in the Cape Colony, determined to make his future there.
