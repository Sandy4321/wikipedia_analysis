'''David Melville "Doc" Smith''' ([[July 27]], [[1884]] &ndash; [[November 26]], [[1962]]) was a renowned [[professor]] and [[mathematician]] at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech).

==Biography==
===Career===
D. M. Smith was born in 1884 in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. He attended [[Vanderbilt University]], earning a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1905 and a [[master's degree]] in 1906. Upon leaving Vanderbilt, Smith began teaching [[mathematics]] at [[Centenary College of Louisiana]]. He later moved to [[Texas]] after accepting a teaching position at Fort Worth University. Smith then returned to [[graduate school]] at the [[University of Chicago]], where he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under the advisement of [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]].<ref>{{ cite web | work=[[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] | publisher=[[North Dakota State University]] | accessdate=2007-10-15 |  url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=6051 | title=David Melville Smith }}</ref> As with the most notable research of his advisor, Smith focused on the [[calculus of variations]] in his [[dissertation]], ''Jacobi's Condition for the Problem of Lagrange in the Calculus of Variations''.<ref>{{ cite journal | year=1916 | title=Jacobi's Condition for the Problem of Lagrange in the Calculus of Variations | last=Smith | first=David M. | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=17 | issue=4 | pages=459-475 | doi=10.2307/1988832 | accessdate=2007-10-15 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-9947%28191610%2917%3A4%3C459%3AJCFTPO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V }}</ref> After graduating from the University of Chicago,<ref>Records are inconsistent about Smith's year of graduation from the University of Chicago; some suggest 1913 as the year, while others suggest 1916.</ref> Smith was hired by the Georgia Institute of Technology as an assistant professor.<ref name="dhwg">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Wallace|title=Dress Her in WHITE and GOLD: A biography of Georgia Tech|publisher=The Georgia Tech Foundation, Inc|year=1969}}</ref><!-- page 416 -->

Smith spent over forty years as a professor of mathematics at Georgia Tech. One of Smith's duties was teaching an introductory [[calculus]] course for which he received much acclaim from students.<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall98/feedback.html | accessdate=2007-10-14 | work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine Online | year=1998 | publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association | title=Feedback: V-12 Program Was Vital | last=Ritch | first=E.R. | quote=One of my favorite professors was Doc [D.M.] Smith, a math professor.

===Personality===
"Doc" Smith, as he was called, made a powerful impression on his students. A Georgia Tech professor and former student of Smith's remembered him as "a friendly, inspiring [[curmudgeon]] who could scare the hell out of you, teach you, advise you, and follow your future after graduation. [...] Dr. Smith was unfailingly interested and supportive."<ref>{{ cite news | work=SciTech Vol. 3 | page=3 | publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Sciences]] | url=http://www.cos.gatech.edu/scitech_v3.pdf | year=2004 | last=Llewellyn | first=Donna C. | page=3 | accessdate=2007-10-14 | title=Faculty Profile: Tech Alumni Remember their Great Teachers at Georgia Tech }}</ref> Other [[List of Georgia Tech alumni|Georgia Tech alumni]] who were instructed by Smith called him "a gifted teacher",<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/spr91/teacher.html | work=Tech Topics | publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association | year=1991 | title=Tribute To a Great Teacher | last=Lampert | first=Sy | accessdate=2007-10-14 }}</ref> unforgettable, likable, and "a good-hearted guy."<ref>{{ cite news | url=http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/win99/burdell.html | accessdate=2007-10-14 | year=1999 | work=Tech Topics | publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association | title=Burdell & Friends: New Centenarian | last=Dunn | first=John | quote='I'll never forget D.

Physically, Smith was described as "a small, white-haired gentleman with a noticeable limp caused by a short leg" who "always wore a black suit with a bow tie." He was often seen driving around the Georgia Tech campus in a [[1930s]] black [[coup<U+00E9>]] automobile similar to the [[Ramblin' Wreck]].<ref name="SmithGem"/>

==D. M. Smith Building==
Smith is recognized by the D. M. Smith Building named in his honor, one of twelve structures comprising the [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District]]. The building was erected in [[1923]] by the [[architectural firm]] Roberts and Company, Inc. with [[U.S. dollar|US$]]150,000 donated by the [[Carnegie Foundation|Carnegie Corporation]] and $50,000 from Greater Georgia Tech Campaign funds. The [[English collegiate architecture|English collegiate]] architectural style of the building, recommended by Georgia Tech architecture faculty members John L. Skinner and Harold Bush-Brown, would serve as an influential model for Georgia Tech campus buildings constructed over the next twenty years.<ref name="MSAA">{{ cite web | url=http://www.artery.org/GaTech.htm | publisher=Marietta Street Artery Association | title=Georgia Institute Of Technology Historic District | accessdate=2007-10-14 }}</ref>

Many [[academic department]]s have been housed in the D. M. Smith Building as institutional needs changed. The first inhabitants were Georgia Tech's Architecture and Physics departments. Later, the building contained offices and laboratories for the Social Sciences, Psychology, and Mathematics departments.<ref name="MSAA"/> Presently, the building is home to the School of History, Technology, and Society and the School of Public Policy in the [[Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts]].<ref>{{ cite web | work=Georgia Tech Campus Map | url=http://gtalumni.org/campusmap/bldngmodel.php?id=24 | publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association | title=Detail of D.
