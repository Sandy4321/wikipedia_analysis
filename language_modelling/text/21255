'''West Hollywood''', colloquially referred to as '''WeHo''', is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The city was incorporated on November 29, 1984. It is notably famous for its unique vibrant commercial corridors, dining, and [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] nightlife focused on the [[Sunset Strip]]. As of the 2011 census, its population is 34,650, with a large proportion of [[gay]] men. Most of West Hollywood is in the Postal Zip Code 90069.<ref name="Dem" />

==Geography==
West Hollywood is bordered on the north by the [[Hollywood Hills]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]],<ref>[http://map.ais.ucla.edu/portal/site/UCLA/menuitem.789d0eb6c76e7ef0d66b02ddf848344a/?vgnextoid=33ec064a9a7d1010VgnVCM1000008f8443a4RCRD UCLA.edu - East of Campus].

New York: Random House.</ref>

The irregular border of the city is featured in the city logo, and was largely formed from the unincorporated Los Angeles County area that had not become part of the surrounding cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://navigatela.lacity.org/common/mapgallery/pdf/annex34x44.pdf |title=Annexation and Detachment Map <U+2013>  City of Los Angeles |accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

West Hollywood benefits from a very dense, compact urban form with small lots, mixed land use, and a walkable street grid. According to Walkscore, a website that ranks cities based on walkability, West Hollywood is the most walkable city in California with a [[Walkscore]] of 89.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cities in California |publisher=[[walkscore.com]] |url=http://www.walkscore.com/CA |accessdate=2013-03-03}}</ref> Commercial corridors include the nightlife and dining focused on the [[Sunset Strip]], along [[Santa Monica Boulevard]], and the Avenues of Art & Design along [[Robertson Boulevard|Robertson]], [[Melrose Avenue|Melrose]], and [[Beverly Boulevard]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Residential neighborhoods in West Hollywood include the [[Norma Triangle]], West Hollywood North, [[West Hollywood West]], West Hollywood East, and West Hollywood Heights, all of which are only a few blocks long or wide. Major intersecting streets typically provide amenities within walking distance of adjacent neighborhoods.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2011}}

Most historical writings about West Hollywood began in the late 1700s with European colonization when the Portuguese explorer [[Jo<U+00E3>o Rodrigues Cabrilho]] arrived offshore and claimed the already inhabited region for Spain.  Around 5,000 of the indigenous inhabitants from the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] [[Indian tribe]] canoed out to greet Juan Cabrillo. The Tongva tribe was a nation of hunter-gatherers known for their reverence of dance and courage. By 1771, these native people had been severely ravaged  by diseases brought in by the Europeans from across wide oceans. The Spanish mission system changed the tribal name to "Gabrielinos", in reference to the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc<U+00E1>ngel|Mission de San Gabriel]]. Early in 1770 [[Gaspar de Portola]]'s Mexican [[expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] stopped just south of the Santa Monica Mountains near what would become West Hollywood to draw [[pitch (resin)|pitch]] (''la brea'') from [[tar pit]]s to waterproof their belongings and to say mass.{{Sfn|Gierach|11-12}} The Gabrielinos are believed to have burned the pitch for fuel.{{Sfn|Torrence|12}}

By 1780, what became the "[[Sunset Strip]]" was the major connecting road for El [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]], and all ranches westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This land passed  through the hands of various owners during the next one hundred years, and it was called names such as "La Brea" and "Plummer" that are listed in historical records.{{Sfn|Gierach|11-12}}<ref name=plummer>{{cite book|last=Plummer|first=E.R.|title=Se<U+00F1>or Plummer|year=1942|publisher=Plummer Committee|location=Los Angeles|pages=70<U+2013>71}}</ref>  Most of this area was part of the [[Rancho La Brea]], and eventually it came to be owned by the [[Henry Hancock]] family.{{Sfn|Torrence|12}}

During the final decade years of the nineteenth century, the first large land development in what would later become West Hollywood<U+2014>the town of "Sherman"<U+2014>was established by [[Moses Sherman]] and his partners of the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], an [[interurban]] [[railroad]] line which later became part of the [[Pacific Electric Railway]] system. Sherman became the location of the railroad's main shops, [[railroad yard]]s, and "car barns". Many working-class employees of the railroad settled in this town.{{Sfn|Gierach|63}} It was during this time that the city began to earn its reputation as a loosely regulated, liquor-friendly (during [[Prohibition]]) place for eccentric people wary of government interference. Despite several annexation attempts, the town elected not to become part of the [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]].<ref name="kcet.org">{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Nathan|date=1 December 2011|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/west-hollywood-at-27-how-the-town-of-sherman-became-weho.html|title=West Hollywood at 27: How the Town of Sherman Became WeHo|website=[[KCET]]|accessdate=2 December 2011}}</ref> In a controversial decision, in 1925 Sherman adopted "West Hollywood", "...a moniker pioneered earlier in the decade by the West Hollywood Realty Board" as its informal name. though it remained under the governance of [[Los Angeles County]].<ref name="kcet.org"/>

For many years, the area that is now the city of West Hollywood was an unincorporated area in the midst of Los Angeles. Because gambling was illegal in the city of Los Angeles, but still legal in Los Angeles County, the 1920s saw the proliferation of many  [[casino]]s, night clubs, etc., along [[Sunset Boulevard]] (which starts in downtown Los Angeles and runs westward). These businesses were immune from the sometimes heavy-handed law-enforcement of the [[L.A. Police Department]].

Some people connected with movie-making were attracted to this less-restricted area of the County, and a number of [[architecture|architecturally]] distinctive apartment buildings and apartment hotels were built. Many interior designers, decorators and "to the trade" furnishing showrooms located in West Hollywood dating back to the middle of the century.

Eventually, the area and its extravagant nightclubs fell out of favor. However, the Sunset Strip and its restaurants, saloons, and nightclubs continued to be an attraction for out-of-town tourists. During the late 1960s, the Sunset Strip was transformed again during the [[hippie]] movement which brought a thriving music publishing industry coupled with "hippie" culture. Some young people from all over the country flocked to West Hollywood.

The most recent migration to West Hollywood came about after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, when thousands of Russian Jews immigrated to the city. A majority of the 5,000 to 6,000 Russian Jews settled in two major immigration waves, 1978<U+2013>79 and 1988<U+2013>92.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tugend |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Tugend |title=Russians & Gays & Lesbians, Oh My... |work=The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles |date=March 24, 2000 |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/old_stories/article/russians_amp_gays_amp_lesbians_oh_my_20000324/}}</ref> Other than New York, West Hollywood's Russian-speaking community is the most concentrated single Russian-speaking region in United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=City of West Hollywood: Russian Speaking Community |publisher=West Hollywood website |url=http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=866 |accessdate=2011-03-08 }}</ref>

In 1984, residents in West Hollywood organized to maintain rent control. When Los Angeles County began planning to discontinue rent controls, West Hollywood was a densely populated area of renters, many of whom would not be able to afford to keep up with the generally rapid raises in rent in the Los Angeles area. A tight coalition of seniors, [[Jew]]s, gays and renters were greatly assisted by the Community for Economic Survival (CES) and they swiftly voted to incorporate as the "City of West Hollywood".  West Hollywood then immediately adopted one of the strongest rent control laws in the nation.<ref>The vacancy-control part of this ordinance has since been rendered null by an act of the state legislature in the early 1990s called Costa-Hawkins that effectively ended "strong" rent control measures in California.</ref>

{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
West Hollywood also has [[inclusionary zoning]] laws governing development. The city established the Affordable Housing Trust Fund in 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.west-hollywood.ca.us/index.aspx?page=514 |title=City of West Hollywood Affordable Housing Trust Fund |publisher=Ci.west-hollywood.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> requiring developers to either provide affordable housing in new projects or pay a fee in-lieu to the city which it directs towards other affordable housing projects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With a socially minded population, West Hollywood adopted one of the nation's first mandatory [[green building]] ordinances on October 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qcode.us/codes/westhollywood/view.php?topic=13--13_24_010&highlightWords=green+building&frames=on |title=West Hollywood Municipal Code Adoption of Green Building Standards Code |publisher=Qcode.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> The ordinance ensures{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that new buildings will be healthier for residents and use energy and resources more efficiently.

[[Traffic congestion]], [[public transport]] and parking are critical issues in the city due to its location between access to areas such as [[Greater Hollywood, Los Angeles|Greater Hollywood]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]] to the east and the area of the Los Angeles West Side, with the [[Hollywood Hills]] creating a natural impediment to the north. [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] and [[Sunset Boulevard]] are critical east-west arteries in the metropolitan area, and [[Laurel Canyon Boulevard]] is a popular shortcut through the hills. Nearly 600 employees and 260 buses in the District 7 [[fleet of the LACMTA]] are based in a large facility on prime real estate near [[San Vicente Boulevard]] and [[Santa Monica Boulevard]]. The development of a "pink line" subway through the city, providing a connection between the [[Metro Red Line (LACMTA)|Metro Red Line]] and a proposed [[Metro Purple Line (LACMTA)|Metro Purple Line]] along [[Wilshire Boulevard]] is currently under study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.net/projects/westside/ |title=Metro Westside Subway Extension |publisher=Metro.net |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

Residents of West Hollywood vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party. They also regularly pass ordinances geared toward reducing perceived discrimination and protecting the public health and dignity of all living things. West Hollywood is nationally known as a front-runner in social justice legislation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 1985, West Hollywood was the first city to create a same-gender [[domestic partnership]] registration for its residents, as well as to offer same-gender [[Domestic partnership|domestic partner]] benefits for city employees. West Hollywood's comprehensive Domestic Partnership Ordinance<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=82 |title=City of West Hollywood: Domestic Partnerships |publisher=Weho.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> allows those couples that are prohibited from marrying (same-sex) and those who can marry but choose not to (heterosexual), to register their union with the city. These unions are treated on an equal basis with legal marriages with respect to city-level benefits and services. In California as a whole, same-sex couples may enter [[domestic partnerships in California|domestic partnerships]] which offer them all of the state rights of marriage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/dpregistry/ |title=California Secretary of State Domestic Partnerships Registry |publisher=Sos.ca.gov |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

In 1993 the West Hollywood City Council voted for West Hollywood to become the first official pro-choice city in America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weho.org/index.aspx?page=114 |title=City of West Hollywood : Mayor Abbe Land |publisher=Weho.org |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>

Legislation prohibiting discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation is widely recognized as the toughest in the nation. The city is also one of 92 jurisdictions in the country where it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of gender identity or expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transgenderlaw.org/ndlaws/index.htm |title=TLPI: U.S. Jurisdictions that include transgender people in human rights laws |publisher=Transgenderlaw.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

City legislation also bans the sale of handguns, prohibits smoking in public places, and restricts the city from doing business directly or indirectly (via vendors) with any country known to violate human rights. Also, the city is one of 19 in California that has banned the use of gas-powered [[leaf blower]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonoise.org/quietnet/cqs/other.htm |title=NPC Quietnet: CQS <U+2013> Other California Cities |publisher=Nonoise.org |date=1991-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

West Hollywood is in close proximity to [[Runyon Canyon Park]]'s hiking trail and dog park in Hollywood.

==Celebrities==

The [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]] Academy Awards Party has traditionally been held at the [[Pacific Design Center]]. It is a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for the foundation.<ref name="ejaf">{{cite web |title = EJAF Fundraising | publisher = Elton John AIDS Foundation | url = http://www.ejaf.org/pages/about/fundraising.html | accessdate =2008-02-26 }}</ref>

The issue of [[Paparazzi]] chasing celebrities is raised regularly and the city participates in meetings with other nearby municipalities such as [[Beverly Hills]] and Los Angeles to discuss the problem and possible actions to better control the activity. The epicenter of the [[Thirty Mile Zone]] lies just blocks to the south of the city, and is the basis for the name of [[TMZ on TV]], a paparazzi footage-based program.  TMZ has moved their operations (within the last year) from Sunset and Crescent Heights Boulevards to a location still to be ascertained.

===Celebrity controversies===

[[File:ChateauMarmont 01.jpg|thumb|[[Chateau Marmont Hotel]] in adjacent [[Hollywood]]]]

In 1982, [[John Belushi]] died of a drug overdose at the [[Chateau Marmont]] hotel in Hollywood, adjacent to WeHo. On the night of his death, he was visited separately by friends [[Robin Williams]] (at the height of his own drug exploits)<ref>''Robin Williams'', television biography from the ''Biography Channel'', 7/7/06.</ref> and [[Robert De Niro]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franksreelreviews.com/shorttakes/morbid.htm#belushi |title=John Belushi Dies at the Chateau Marmont |publisher=Franksreelreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> each of whom left the premises, leaving Belushi in the company of assorted others, including [[Cathy Smith]].  This is just one of many notable sordid events at the location. A 1930s movie executive reportedly said, 'If you must get into trouble, do it at the Chateau Marmont'.

In 1961, comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] was arrested on [[obscenity]] charges at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in then-unincorporated West Hollywood. The arresting officer was a young deputy named [[Sherman Block]], who would later become County Sheriff.

In 1989, actor [[Christian Slater]] was arrested in West Hollywood for leading the police on a drunken car chase that ended when Slater crashed his car into a telephone pole.

==Controversies==
Sometime in the 1940s a sign appeared over the bar at [[Barney's Beanery]] that said "FAGOTS <U+2013> STAY OUT." The message so offended locals that ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine did an article on opposition to the sign in 1964, which included a photograph of the owner steadfastly holding on to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jmu.edu/safezone/wm_library/Timeline%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf |title=LGBT Timeline (from the 60<U+2019>s to the 90<U+2019>s) from James Sears<U+2019> LGBT Timeline |publisher=[[James Mason University]] |date= |accessdate=2013-09-21 |type=pdf}}</ref> The owner died in 1968, and efforts continued to have the sign removed. The [[Gay Liberation Front]] organized a [[Zap (action)|zap]] of the restaurant on February 7, 1970 to push for its removal. The sign disappeared that day.<ref>Teal, pp. 255<U+2013>57</ref> The sign was put up and taken down several times over the next 14 years, but the practice ended in December 1984, days after the city voted itself into existence. The then-mayor, [[Valerie Terrigno]], the entire city council and gay-rights activists marched into Barney's and relieved the wall of the offending sign.<ref>Kenney, p. 50</ref> It was held by [[Morris Kight]] for many years and now rests in the [[ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives]].

A resident drew national attention during the [[2008 Presidential campaign]] by including a [[Sarah Palin]] [[mannequin]] hung in effigy in a [[Halloween]] display. The home's decorations also featured a doll of [[John McCain]] surrounded by decorative flames in the chimney. Some residents complained about the display as a [[hate crime]], but the Los Angeles County Sheriff concluded the display did not violate any laws.<ref name="latimesPalin">{{cite news | last = Kim | first = Victoria | title = Effigy of Sarah Palin hanging by a noose creates uproar in West Hollywood | work = Los Angeles Times  | publisher = Los Angeles Times | date = October 28, 2008  | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-palineffigy28-2008oct28,0,541630.story | accessdate = October 31, 2008 }}</ref>

In March 2006, agents from [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] and the [[U.S. Secret Service]] seized 250 [[fake denomination]] notes, each bearing a denomination of $1 billion, from a West Hollywood apartment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://communitydispatch.com/Department_of_Homeland__Security_63/HOMELAND_SECURITY_AGENTS_SEIZE__BILLION_DOLLAR__BO_4175.shtml |title=Homeland Security Agents Seize "Billion Dollar" Bogus Federal Reserve Notes |publisher=Communitydispatch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

In 2006, the City Council passed a [[medicinal marijuana]] resolution, by a vote of 4<U+2013>0, making it the first city in [[Southern California]] to adopt a lowest law enforcement priority law for cannabis offenses.

==Politics and government==

===Local===
The city government is headed by a five-member city council, including a mayor and a mayor pro tem who serve one-year terms. The positions of mayor and mayor pro tem are largely-ceremonial positions which rotate between the council members, and both positions are largely not re-elected in concurrent terms, although councilmembers serve multiple non-concurrent terms in both offices. 

West Hollywood was the first city in the country to have a city council with a majority of gay members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gaytoday.badpuppy.com/garchive/people/032000pe.htm |title=Gay Today: People |publisher=Gaytoday.badpuppy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>  Council member [[John Heilman]] is the city's longest-serving council member (having served continuously since 1984).

On February 19, 2001, West Hollywood became the second city in the United States (after [[Boulder, Colorado]]) to change the term pet "owner" to pet "guardian" in their municipal codes.<ref>[http://www.nabrlaw.org/portals/10/PDF%20Files/LSOFNHA2002.pdf NABR Animal Law Section <U+2013> Ownership v.

With West Hollywood being one of the most prominent gay-friendly cities in the United States, it was no surprise that [[Proposition 8]] had the highest rejection in West Hollywood than all of the cities in Los Angeles county. A whopping 86% of the city voted against the amendment, which restricted marriage to heterosexual couples. 14% voted in favor of the amendment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gay marriage ban: How cities in Los Angeles County voted|url=http://projects.latimes.com/elections/la-county-prop-8-results-by-city/|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

===Representation===

===Social services===
West Hollywood, with a gay male population of about 41%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weho.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=623 |title=City of West Hollywood Demographic Profile 2002 <U+2013> PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref> has been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic which has ravaged its gay male population since the early 1980s. This town  funds or subsidizes an array of services for those living with [[HIV]] or [[AIDS]]. The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] parks a Mobile HIV/STD testing van outside of the city's busiest nightclubs on Friday and Saturday nights, and again on Sunday afternoons.  This outreach attempts to intervene with those young people most at-risk for HIV infection. [[Project Angel Food]] receives city funding to deliver hundreds of fresh lunches and dinners daily which are prepared under the supervision of a registered dietitian who tailors the meals to meet individual client's nutritional needs.  [[AIDS Project Los Angeles]] (APLA) is a national leader for AIDS policy and advocacy issues and provides assistance to clients navigating the maze of available public benefits.  APLA also provides free dental, psychotherapy and pharmaceutical services.  [[Aid for AIDS]] provides direct financial support by assisting clients with rent, utility and pharmacy expenses.  The city also subsidizes agencies that help clients train for a return to the workforce. The city permits all residents living with HIV/AIDS to have up to two pets in his or her home regardless of a landlord's specifications in the property's lease.

West Hollywood subsidizes programs for its growing population of children through a partnership with the [[USDA]] and local schools.  "Healthy Start West Hollywood" is a program of the city's Social Services division that introduces pre-Kindergarten through High School age kids to the benefits of good nutrition through such activities as collective vegetable gardens and yoga.

The special needs of senior citizens are addressed through a variety of programs.  West Hollywood either funds or subsidizes agencies that offer adult day care, a roommate matching service, and nutritious meals.  The West Hollywood Senior Center provides recreational programs, excursions, and socializing as well as counseling and case management.

West Hollywood also seeks to address the health needs of residents who do not have adequate insurance by subsidizing the LA Free Clinic and The [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]].  Residents can access free medical, dental, legal and mental health services between these two sites.

The West Hollywood's Public Safety Division publishes guides on sexual assault prevention, nightclub safety, and how to access rape services.<ref>
