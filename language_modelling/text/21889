'''Cloverdale''' is a [[town centre]] of [[Surrey, British Columbia]], located near [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley]], which is east of [[Vancouver]].  It is near several border crossings into the [[United States]]. Cloverdale is home to many heritage sights, and is over one hundred years old. One of its oldest buildings, Surrey Center Elementary, has been rebuilt many times over the years, but still stands today having just been rebuilt once again in 2003 and classes there are still in session for kindergarten through grade seven. 

==Film industry==
Cloverdale is best-known outside its immediate vicinity as the primary "main street" and "downtown" sets for the television show [[Smallville (TV series)|''Smallville'']]. A billboard on the edge of the community reads, "Destination Cloverdale - Home of Smallville."

The community has been home to other filming, including one of [[Coca-Cola]]'s Christmas commercials. Despite filming during summer, the town square was decked with Christmas decorations, including fake snow. In June 2006, a film titled ''Deck the Halls'' was filmed, and the area was once again decorated in Christmas decorations and fake snow.  In September 2006 the feature film [[Postal (film)|Postal]] was filmed in Cloverdale.

The 2007 film ''[[Hot Rod (film)|Hot Rod]]'', starring [[Andy Samberg]], was also filmed in Cloverdale. A portion of 157th Street was shut down to accommodate a [[riot]] scene and a [[motorcycle]] stunt involving jumping over fifteen [[school bus]]es was filmed at the [[Cloverdale Fairgrounds]].

==Rodeo==

It is the second largest rodeo in Canada after the [[Calgary Stampede]]. Its location, the [[Cloverdale Fairgrounds]], is also home to Fraser Downs which is a popular racetrack and casino.
