'''[[Bangalore]]''' (Bengaluru), the capital of  [[Karnataka]] state, India, reflects its multireligious and cosmopolitan character by its more than 1000 [[temple]]s, 400 [[mosques]], 100 [[Churches]], 40 [[Jain]] [[mandirs]], three [[Gurudwara]]s, two [[Buddha|Buddhist]] [[Vihara]]s and one [[Parsi]] Agiari located in an area of 741&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of the metropolis.<ref name=home>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/08/29/stories/2002082900270200.htm|title= Home to all faiths|accessdate=2009-03-11|publisher=The Hindu}}</ref><ref name="area">{{cite web |url=http://www.kar.nic.in/finance/bud2007/bs07e.pdf|title=Finance Budget for 2007-08, the total area of Greater Bangalore has been mentioned in the Karnataka budget of 2007-08 as 741 km<U+00B2>|page=77|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=2009-03-11|format=PDF}}</ref>.The religious places are further represented to include the few members of  the [[Jewish]] community who are making their presence known through the [[Chabad]] that they  propose to establish in [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] and the fairly large number of [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s]] whose presence is registered with a society called the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Centre.<ref name=jews>{{web|url=http://mostlyslow.blogspot.com/2008/08/jews-in-south-india-part-1-tisha-bav.html|title= Jews in Bangalore|accessdate=2009-3-11}}</ref>
In the demographically diverse, major economic hub and India's fastest-growing major metropolis of Bengaluru, the number of religious places of each religion reported reflects growth in proportion to the population growth. According to the 2001 [[Census of India]], 79.37% of Bangalore's population is [[Hindu]], roughly the same as the [[Demographics of India|national average]].<ref name=GISData>{{cite web|url=
http://www.censusindiamaps.net/page/Religion_WhizMap1/housemap.htm|title= "Census GIS Household". censusindiamaps.net. |date=2006|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref> Muslims comprise 13.37% of the population, which again is roughly the same as the national average, while [[Christian]]s and [[Jain]]s account for 5.79% and 1.05% of the population, respectively, double that of their national averages. [[Anglo-Indians]] also form a substantial group within the city.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.censusindia.gov.in/|title= Total Population, Slum Population|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070806121833/http://www.censusindia.net/results/slum/slum2.html|date=2007-08-06|title= Census of India,2006, Government of India|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2008/feb/06sld2.htm|title=India's 10 fastest growing cities|publisher= Rediff.com.|date=February 6, 2008|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

The various types of religious institutions of different [[culture]]s and sub&ndash;cultures that coexist in the city also reflect the eclectic mix of [[languages]] spoken in Bangalore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdesi.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2290&type=details&Itemid=54|title=Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-22}}</ref>

==Hindus and temples==
The thousand and odd number of Hindu temples in Bengaluru mirrors the majority population of the city whose earliest traditional Hindu temple is traced to the [[Domlur]] Chokkanatha temple of the [[Chola]] period ([[tenth century]]). The next oldest temple is the  [[Halasuru Someshwara Temple]] Ulsoor (of the [[Hoysala]]s built between twelfth century and thirteenth century &ndash; a combination of [[Hoysala]], [[Chola]], and [[Vijayanagara Architecture]]), which was renovated and beautified by three generations of the Yelahanka dynasty-&ndash;Gidde Gowda, [[Kempe Gowda I]] and II.<ref name=home/> According  to a folk legend of this oldest temple, it is said that Kempe Gowda, tired after hunting, rested under a tree and fell asleep on the present site of the temple. Lord [[Someshwara]] appeared to him in a dream, revealing the existence of hidden [[treasure]] and told him to build the temple dedicated to him with it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/s/019pho000430s41u00025000.html |title=The online gallery of the British Library |accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>

===Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple===
Another ancient temple is the [[Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple]], in the [[Chola]] style of architecture, which is a protected monument under the [[Karnataka]] Ancient and Historical Monuments, and [[Archaeological]] Sites and Remains Act 1961. It is a cave temple dedicated to Lord [[Shiva]]. It is one of the best architectural monuments depicting a monolithic idol of Lord [[Shiva]] made of [[granite]], a rare idol of [[Agni]], the God of fire and monolithic exquisitely carved four pillars in side the cave. The cave temple is also stated to be a fine piece of Indian [[rock cut architecture]] of the [[ninth century]]. In the sixteenth century  Kempe Gowdas added grandeur to the temple by building the frontage to the cave temple with [[Gopura]]s (towers), large [[trident]]s, discs known as Suryapana and Chandrapana representing  the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]], a [[damaru]] ([[drum]]) and a [[fan]] (all pictured in the gallery).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourtravelworld.com/india/bangalore/|title=About Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-15|publisher=Tour Travel:World.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web

Another interesting astronomical feature which attracts thousands of devotes to the temple on [[Makara Sankranthi]] day in January is of sun rays passing between the horns of the [[Nandi]] (Bull), located outside at the entrance to the temple, which lights the idol of Shiva inside the cave.<ref name=home/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templenet.com/Karnataka/gavigang.html|title= Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple at Bangalore(Karnataka) |accessdate=2009-03-15|publisher=The Templenet Encyclopedia:Temples of Karnataka}}</ref>

===Bull temple===
A famous temple built in the sixteenth century during the rule of Kempegowdas, is the Bull temple or the [[Nandi Temple]] (<U+2018>Nandi<U+2019> in Sanskrit means <U+2018>joyful<U+2019>) made of granite. This temple built in 1537 on a hill top with a porch in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture|Vijayanagara architectural style]] is named after the large granite Nandi [[monolith]] placed on a [[plinth]] in the temple shrine. The temple is exclusive for the worship of the sacred bull in [[Hinduism]], known as [[Nandi bull|Nandi]], [[Lord Shiva]]'s [[vahana]], or animal mount. Nandi idol at this temple is said to be one of the largest in the world, with height of about {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|ft|m}} length. Temples for Dodda [[Ganapathy]] (huge [[Ganesha]] -&ndash; {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} height & {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide) and for Lord Shiva, a little above the Ganesha temple, are also located at the foot of the hill. A [[peanut|groundnut]] fair called Kadalekay Parishe in [[Kannada language]], which is linked to a popular folklore legend, is held by farmers every year during November to thank Nandi for  the good yield of this crop and to seek further blessings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/mysore/nt01.html|title=Nandi Temple|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/mysore/nt02.html|title=Nandi Temple|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/mysore/nt03.html|title=Tower|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saigan.com/heritage/temple/nandib.html|title=Basavanagudi Nandi Temple|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> 
[[File:Temple at entrance to Avensue road of the Old Bangaluru Pete.JPG|thumb|right|200px|One of the oldest [[Hanuman]] temple at [[Yelahanka]] gate in the heart of Bangalore]]

===Other temples===
Apart from the above famous temples, the other  temples built between the sixteenth and nineteenth  centuries are also numerous and some of the well known ones with interesting history are the 1)  Karanji Anjaneya in [[Basavanagudi]], 2) Bande Mahakali, 3) Pralayakalada Veerabhadra, 4) Kalabhairava in Gavipura Guttahalli, 5) Basaveshwara in the fort (shifted to Mamulpet), 6) Anjaneya at Yelahanka Gate (at Avenue road crossing), 7) Dharmaraya at the end of OTC Road, 8) Ranganathaswamy in Balepete. 9) Kadu Malleswara temple at [[Malleswaram]], 10) Kote Venkataramanaswamy ([[Srinivasa]])  temple (1690) adjoining  [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Palace, [[Kasi]] Vishveshwara temple (1840) in Balepete and 11) Bennekrishna temple at Tulasi Thota, 11) [[Mookambika]] Temple in Mahalakshmi Layout famous for its oracular powers and 12) the [[ISKCON]] temple in Mahalakshmi Layout. Many temples have been built by ordinary citizens and are also patronised by certain communities such as the [[Devanga]], [[Golla]], Besta (fisherfolk), [[Uppara]], Goniga, Kshaurika (barber), Nagartha, [[Ganiga]] (oilfolk), [[Vishwakarma]], and so forth. The most popular temples listed are that of [[Anjaneya|Hanuman]] (the monkey God), 635 numbers, and the oldest of them is reported to be the Anjaneya temple on [[Mysore]] Road, said to have been established in 1425 by Vyasaraja.<ref name=home/>

==Muslims and mosques==
[[File:Oldest Mosque in Bengaluru in City market.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the oldest [[Mosque]]s in Bangalore at the city market]]
[[File:Peace through grille.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An old Mosque in Cantonment area of Bangalore - seen through a gate]]
The earliest recorded history of Islamic influence in Bengaluru could be traced to 1638, when the old [[Bengaluru Pete]] (now an integral part of the Bengaluru city) was conquered by [[Bijapur Sultan]] who ruled for the next 50 years. The [[Mughals]] took over in 1687 and leased the town and the surrounding areas to Chikkadeva Raya [[Wodeyar]] of the [[Mysore Kingdom]], in 1690 AD. Chikkadeva Raya Wodeyar (1673 AD &ndash;1704 AD) built an oval-shaped fort south of the old mud fort and  after his death in 1704 AD, the rule of  [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tippu Sultan]] ensued till Tippu's death at the hands of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1790. It was during this period that [[mosque]]s and [[darga]]s were built in Bengaluru.<ref name=public>{{cite web|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172004-231956/unrestricted/4.pdf|title= Public Space In Bangalore: Present And Future Projections|pages=33 to 68|accessdate=2009-03-07}}</ref><ref name=biotec>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060919220936/http://www.bangaloreit.in/html/aboutbng/history.htm |title = About Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=official Web site of the Department of Bangalore IT and Biotechnology, Government of Karnataka}}</ref>

Thus, over a period of 370 years from the earliest rule of the [[Bijapur Sultan]] in 1638, Muslim shrines (mosques or [[masjid]]s and darghas) have been built which now number more than 400 and indicates the large Muslim population of the city. Some of the important mosques and darghas in Bangalore are discussed below.

===Jamia Masjid===
Jamia Masjid, situated near the City Market, is the most impressive mosque in Bangalore. Designed by Rayyaz Asifuddin of [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], India, it was built in 1940 with white marble from [[Rajasthan]] and is dedicated to [[Tippu Sultan]]. This land mark has bulbous domes, twin towers standing on exquisitely carved granite pillars and fashioned [[jali]] work in the balcony. It is a five&ndash;storeyed structure, with space to accommodate up to 10,000 devotees.  With an ablution pool in the centre of mosque, the ambiance inside the mosque is cool, serene and airy. In the elevated prayer hall of the mosque, beautiful [[bubris]] (frescoes) that bear mark of Tippu Sultan have been revealed, after removing the old plaster. Muslims in large numbers congregate here during the death anniversary of Tippu Sultan, to mark the "Tipu Urs".<ref name=majid>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverbangalore.com/worship2.htm|title=Hindu Places of Worship|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref><ref name=sight>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangalorebest.com/discoverbangalore/sightseeing/religion/index2.asp |title= Places of Worship|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/india/bangalore/sightseeing-in-bangalore/jumma-masjid-in-bangalore.html|title= Jumma Masjid in Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>

===The Jumma Masjid===
The Jumma Masjid located on the Old Poor House Road in the [[Cantonment]] area of the city is also said to be one of the oldest mosques, built by Abdul Quddus in the early nineteenth century. It was earlier known as the Sangian Jamia Masjid but is now called the Jumma Masjid. While the raised prayer hall of the mosque has granite pillars, the building as such is a brick and mortar structure with ornate jali work and floral motifs in plaster on the facade.<ref name=majid/><ref name=sight/>.

===Other mosques===
Of the many other older masjids in the city, the important ones are the Sangeen Jamia Masjid in Taramandalpet built by the [[Moghul]]s (1687<U+2013>1690), the Ibrahim Shah Sahele Masjid built in 1761 (at Kumbarpete) by Hyder Khilledar Ibrahim Khan and the Bademakan Masjid (Siddiah Road) built during [[Hyder Ali]]'s period by two [[Sufi]] saints of [[Bijapur, Karnataka|Bijapur]].<ref name=majid/>
[[File:Hazrath Tawakkal Mosque.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Hazrath Tawakkal Mosque or Dargha decorated during the [[Karaga]], a Hindu festival]]

===Dargas===
There are 24 [[dargha]]s  (darghas are [[Sufi]] shrines built over the grave of  revered religious figures) in Bangalore and the popular ones are the Kambal Posh Darga (Old Broadway), Hazarat Tawakkal Mastan Shah Darga (Cottonpet) and Besarwali Shahi Darga (Cubbonpet). The Tawakkal Mastan, in particular, has a legend which has a Hindu linkage as it is associated with a local Hindu festival called ''karaga''. According to a popular folk legend, Hazrat Tawakkal Mastan, a mason from Arabia while working in disguise as an ordinary [[coolie]] (labour) in the construction of [[Hyder Ali]]'s fort was trampled by a crowd during the [[karaga]] procession and fainted but was revived by some Hindu priests who applied ''kumkum'' ([[vermillion]] powder), which resulted in the healing of  his wounds and recovery. Since then, on his insistence, the ''karaga'' procession used to stop at the dargah as mark of respect and devotion, which is continued to this day.<ref name=majid/> Thus, the two religious systems coming together every year at the Tawakkal Dargah (which has a history of over 200 years), on the occasion of the annual Karaga festival of Dharmaraya Swamy reflects a "syncretic cultural legacy".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/india/karnataka/bangalore/sights/dargahhazarathtawakkalmastan|title= Dargah-e-Qutb-e-Bangalore, Syedina Hazrat Tawakkal Masthan Suhrawardi (RA)|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>

==Christianity and churches==
[[File:PIC 0478.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St. Mary's Basilica - Oldest church in Bangalore]]
[[File:Church of the Infant Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Infant Jesus Church]]
Bengaluru with recorded number of 40 churches (thus also called the city of churches), represents diverse Christian communities, such as the Roman Catholic Church, the ancient Syrian Church of Kerala and its reformed counterpart, the Mar Thoma Church,  Protestants from the Church of South India (which includes Anglicans, Lutherans and other older denominations) and newer evangelical groups with links to the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/20/world/bangalore-journal-christians-revel-in-conversion-back-to-indianness.html|title=Bangalore Journal; Christians Revel in Conversion Back to Indianness|accessdate=2009-03-21|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>

It was in the year 1648 that [[Christianity]] made its first mark in [[Srirangapattana]], the capital city of the then [[Mysore]] Kingdom.  [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] was not a big city those days.  Even though the first Church in Bangalore was dated to the years 1724&ndash;1725  the spread of Christianity suffered a decline during Tippu Sultan's rule.  However, the history  of revival of  [[Christianity]]  in Bangalore is traced to the year 1799 when the French priest Fr. Abbe du Bois  came to  Bangalore, at a time when the [[Great Britain|British]] seized [[Srirangapattana]] from [[Tipu Sultan]]. He restored the [[Christian]] religion in the city by building confidence of the Christians living in and around Bangalore in Somanahalli, Kamanahalli, Begur, Gunjam, Palahalli, Doranahalli, Garenahalli, Shettyhalli and other villages  and by extending them spiritual solace. His acts of service to the people also involved introduction of vaccination in India.
 
'''St. Mary's Basilica''' was built by Fr. Abbe du Bois in 1803 as a Chapel of thatched roof at ''Bili Akki Palli'' or colloquially known as <U+2018><U+2018>Blackpally<U+2019><U+2019> (now known as [[Shivajinagar]])and offered mass there and that structure was called Kaanike Mathe Devalaya (which in Kannada means the Church of Our Lady of Presentation) and that is  the present St. Mary's Basilica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/08/29/stories/2002082900270200.htm|title= Home to all faiths|accessdate=2009-03-20|author=K.

L. E. Kleiner. It was consecrated on September 8, 1882 by Bishop Jean-Yves-Marie Coadou, the [[vicar apostolic]] of [[Mysore]]. Over the years, the church of St. Mary's at Blackpally became a parish and was elevated to the status of minor [[basilica]] in 1973 through an order by [[Pope Paul VI]] (The church  was the sixth church in India to be elevated to this status). Stained glass windows and multiple columns with a rich [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capital support the stately arches of the Church.

Other prominent Churches built in Bangalore under the overall directions of the [[Parish]] were the St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral (1851), St. Joseph's Church (1867) and the Sacred Heart Church, Ashokanagara (1867) and many others.<ref name="majid"/>

The other old churches in Bangalore are the St. Luke's (Fort, 1830), the St. Joseph's (Briand Square, 1857), the St. Patrick's (Brigade Road, 1844), the Sacred Heart's (Richmond Road, 1874) and many others. 

Among the [[Protestant]] Churches, the old and well known ones are the St. Mark's Cathedral (M.G. Road, 1808), Holy Trinity (M.G. Road, 1851), St. Andrews (Cubbon Road, 1867), East Parade (Dickenson Road, 1862), Wesley Church (Promenade Road, 1896) and Hudson Memorial (City Corporation, 1904). 

'''Infant Jesus Church''' at Vivek Nagar, which is now the biggest church in Karnataka and a popular pilgrimage centre, has a long history of sacrifice and devotion. The Church was first conceived by Fr. Paul Kinatukara in the sixties and the foundation was laid in April 1970 by Rev.Dr.Lourduswamy, the then [[Archbishop]] of Bangalore. The missionary zeal (in spite of daunting hurdles) of  Fr. L. Peter established  the church on a firm footing and the church was opened to devotees in the year 1979, to honour and glorify the divine [[Infant Jesus of Prague]]. Designed by the Architects of Thomas Associates, the church with a fan shaped hall can accommodate about 2500 people. It has 9 faces and openings running all round the church. People seated anywhere in the interior of the church feel that the [[altar]] is facing them. The [[podium]] is raised above road level with steps and ramp on either side. The replica of the nativity scene in the nativity church of [[Jerusalem]] is the main mural of size {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on|1}}x{{convert|9 |mi|km|abbr=on|1}}. The remarkable feature of the church is the secular nature of the devotees who throng seeking blessings, particularly on Thursdays and Saturdays. St Mary's Feast is celebrated in September every year when devotees gather at the Church dressed in orange colour.<ref name=majid/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infantjesusshrine.com/history.html|title=Infant Jesus Shrine|accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/india/bangalore/sightseeing-in-bangalore/infant-jesus-church-bangalore.html.|title=Infant Jesus Church Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-19}}</ref>

'''St Patricks Church''' located on Brigade road is the second oldest church in the city (around 160 years old - foundation laid in July 1841). Father Chevalier was responsible for building the church, which was consecrated as a cathedral in 1899. The foundation was laid in July 1841 and the building was completed in 1844. In 1887, the Catholic Hierarchy for southern India Pope Leo XIII was proclaimed in this church in 1887. Renovated in 1894-98, on November 12, 1899 the church was consecrated as St. Patrick Cathedral. It has a beautiful arched entrance flanked by twin columns. The interior of the church has twelve graceful pillars which symbolise the twelve apostles. The twin spires of the Church are a landmark in the city cantonment.<ref name=majid/><ref name=church>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangalorebest.com/homepage/photofeature/church/church.asp|title=Photo feature Churches of Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-22|publisher=Bengalorebest.com}}</ref>

'''St. Andrew's Kirk,''' the only Scottish Kirk in Bangalore, is located on the Cubbon Road. The stained glass windows in the Church depict Lord [[Jesus]] and his eight [[apostles]]. The walls are adorned with polished brass plaques and a pipe organ installed in 1881 is also seen in the Church.<ref name=majid/>

'''Holy Trinity Church''' located at Trinity circle is an exquisite landmark at the east end of the [[Mahatma Gandhi Road]], built in 1848&ndash;51 in the [[English Renaissance]] style, and was designed by Major Pears, foundation was laid on February 16, 1848 and consecrated on July 25, 1852. The church can accommodate 700 people and is considered as the largest "military" church in [[South India]].<ref name=church/>

==Jainism and Jain mandirs==
[[File:Entrance arch of the oldest Jain temple in Chickpete in Banagalore.JPG|left|thumb|175px|View of the entrance to One of the oldest Jain temples in Chickpete in Bangalore]]
[[Jainism]], traditionally known as [[Jain Dharma]], is a dharmic religion and philosophy originating in [[Ancient India]]. The Jains follow the teachings of the 24 [[Tirthankaras]] (saints) and Lord [[Mahavira]], accepted as the founder of the faith, was the 24th Thirthankara who lived in [[sixth century]]. Jains have significantly influenced the religious, ethical, political and economic spheres in India for over two millennia. They are best described by the adage that "Business is in their blood. Peace is their badge."<ref name="Janism">{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismtravelindia.com/pilgrimages_tour/jainism/jainism.html|title=Janism|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>
The combination makes them an extraordinary community in India and so is their case in Bangalore. Of the 40 odd Jain temples in Bangalore, the [[Digambar]] temples are fewer than the Svetambara temples. Digambar and [[Svethambar]] are the two [[sangha]]s (society) of Jain religion. Digambar Jain [[monk]]s do not wear clothes since they believe that  clothes are like other possessions, increasing dependency and desire for material things, and desire for anything ultimately leads to sorrow and are therefore called "sky clad". Swethambar Jain [[monk]]s wear white seamless clothes for practical reasons and believe there is nothing in Jain scripture that condemns wearing clothes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jainsamaj.org/literature/deepti-270303.htm|title=Jains: From business to peace, from education to service|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref> The two well known Digambar Temples in Bangalore are explained below.

[[File:New Jain temple in Jaiynagar, Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|right|200px|New Jain temple in Jayanagar, suburb of Bangalore]]
'''Sri Mahavir Digambara Jain temple''', located in the Dewan's lane of Chickpet area (of the [[Bengaluru Pete]]) has an idol of Bhagawan [[Mahavira]] in the kayotsarga posture. The temple constructed in 1878 has undergone many renovations and even now is under renovation. But the entrance arch to the temple is intact (pictured). The idols of Bhagawan Parshwanatha, [[Bahubali]], Vimalanatha, Ananathanatha and Brahma Yaksha are seen in this temple. A Dharmashala (guest house) for the pilgrims, Mahaveera Bhavan (house), [[Ahimsa]] [[Mandir]] (House of non-violence) and a well equipped library containing the books on Jainism are part of the temple complex.<ref name="Janism"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/karnataka/bangalore.htm|title=Jainism in India,  Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>

==Sikhism  and Gurudwara==
[[File:Gurudwara in Bangalore..jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gurudwara on the bank of Ulsoor lake in Bangalore]]
[[Guru Nanak]], the [[Sikh]] [[Guru]], was the first Sikh to visit Bengaluru. On his way back from [[Sri Lanka]] he halted at Bangalore. Kempegowda met him and sought his blessings. Gurunanak not only blessed Kempegowda but also told him to develop the place.

But it took many more years for a Sikh Gurudwara to be built in Bangalore. There are now three Gurudwaras in Bangalore. The first Sikh Gurudwara and the largest in Bangalore near the Ulsoor Lake on the Kensington Road, is an elegant and white structure (pictured), which was opened on April 13, 1946.  It has been renovated recently with marble floors. The large prayer hall accommodates about 500 devotees at a time. Special prayers are offered every Sunday. The temple wears a colourful look as special prayers are offered  and more than  a thousand people from all religions come here to worship. The Sri Guru Singh Sabha which manages the Gurudwara also runs a school, a medical centre and a function hall also provides accommodation (a day's stay) to the tourists.<ref name="majid"/>
==Buddhism and  Viharas==
[[File:A View of Buddha Vihar at Bangalore.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A view of Buddha Vihar in Bangalore]]

While under the [[Mauryas]] and [[Satavahana]]s Buddhism prospered in [[Karnataka]], the influence of [[Hinduism]] expanded as it subsumed most of the teachings of [[Buddha]] and [[Buddhism]] and thus Buddhism lost its distinct uniqueness in the state. However, in the twentieth century, [[Buddha]] [[vihara]]s  have been established in  the State with Bengaluru  recording two such viharas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaprofile.com/religion-culture/buddhisminkarnataka.htm|title=The Buddhist Legacy <U+2013> Buddhism in Karnataka|accessdate=2009-03-22|publisher=India Profile}}</ref>
 
'''The Maha Bodhi Society''' (MBS) was established by Acharya Buddharakkhita in 1956 at Bangalore with the objective of propagating the teachings of the [[Buddha]] and to provide the inspiration and facilities for putting that teaching into practice through spiritual, social, educational activities. The first act of the Acharya was to plant a sapling of the holy [[Bodhi tree]] from Bodh Gaya at the premises of the proposed Society. This tree has grown with the Society and is venerated. The Maha Bodhi Society Temple, a relatively new structure, was then built with the main shrine replicating the historic tower at Bodh Gaya. Temple as built is a [[brick]] structure with a central tower of {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} height. The [[Stupa]] that represents a basic factor in the teaching of the Buddha has also been built at the entrance to the Temple which is made of granite and it enshrines a relic of the Buddha. The temple, the stupa and the Bodhi tree in the temple complex now form a unique landmark in Bangalore. It is a place of worship and meditation, a center of pilgrimage for people from all over India and other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotelsinbangalore.net/temples_in_bangalore.htm|title=Temples in Bangalore, Karnataka|accessdate=2009-3=15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mustseeindia.com/Bangalore-Maha-Bodhi-Society-Temple/attraction/10522.|title= Maha Bodhi Society Temple|accessdate-2009-3-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.vsnl.com/mahabodhi/|title= Maha Bodhi Society Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-15|publisher= Mahabodhi Website}}</ref>

'''Choe Khor Sum Ling Centre''', located in Domlur Layout, is a centre for the study and practice of [[Tibetan]] [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Buddhism]]. This Centre was set up in 2003 at the initiative of HH [[Dalai Lama]] by Lama Zopa Rinpoche. The name of the center means 'The Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma'. [[Buddhist]] meditation techniques and teachings on the various aspects of the <U+2018>Graduated Path to Enlightenment<U+2019> are taught here. In addition to regular teachings, every few weeks the Centre also invites senior [[Lamas]] to give talks on important aspects of the [[Buddhist]] path, which are followed by instructions into different meditation practices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cksl.in/aboutus.html|title= Choe Khor Sum Ling Center, Bangalore|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref> Ahimsamaya, a magazine devoted to vast heritage of the Pragya Paramita Buddhist tradition of Indian thinking in philosophy and spirituality is also brought out by the Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cksl.in/downloads/AbhisamayaVol1.pdf|title= Ahimsamaya|accessdate=2009-03-17}}</ref>

==Zoroastrians (Parsis) and  Agiari==
[[File:Agiari - Parsi temple in Bangalore.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Parsi fire temple Agiari in Bangalore]]
[[Zoroastrianism]] was founded by the prophet Spitama [[Zarathustra]]. The religion asserts that there is one god, [[Ahura Mazda]] (Wise Lord), other gods being manifestations of his qualities. The people who practiced Zoroastrianism and who fled from south-west [[Iran]] to India (initially came to the west coast of India and subsequently moved to other parts of India) due to persecution by Muslims in 642 AD (when the last [[Iran]]ian empire was conquered by the [[Arabs]]) are called [[Parsi]]s. The only possession they had when they came to India was nothing more than the sacred fire from their temple. Under the Great Britain rule they prospered immensely. It is estimated that there are 1,30,000 [[Zoroastrian]]s in the world; majority of them, about 1,00,000 live in India. They have retained their distinct identity and have contributed richly to India's progress in all sectors of development. The members of the community emerged as successful businessmen, lawyers, and doctors and have worked largely in the service sector. In the early 1900s retired bankers, accountants and businessmen moved from west coast and established them selves in Bangalore, as in those days, Bangalore was considered a retirement paradise. The early settlers to Bangalore built the fire temple on Queen's Road in 1926 with the help of Dinshaw Cawasji, a contractor from [[Mumbai]] and called it the 'Baidhanmai and Cawasji Dadabhai Dar-E-Meher', which caters to the small group of Parsis, about 700, residing in the city. An eternal fire burns in the inner sanctum fed by [[sandal wood]], as the symbol of the life cycle and eternal recurrence. The temple has carvings of [[cattle|bull]]s on its many pillars. Only the [[priest]]s are allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum where the eternal fire burns. A Parsi is one who is born into the religion since Zoroastrianism is a non&ndash;proselytising religion. Their Holy Book is known as the Kordeh [[Avesta]] along with the [[Vendidad]], lists prayers and prescribes tenets to be followed. The Bangalore Parsi Zoroastrian Association (BPZA) and the Bangalore Zoroastrian Anjuman (BZA) hold regular meetings to discus the issues concerning the community.(also refer external link)<ref>{{cite web|url=

[[File:Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Centre, Bangalore.JPG|thumb|right|200px| Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Centre, Bangalore]]
The [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]], a monotheistic religion that recognizes the religious canons of other religions, was founded by [[Bah<U+00E1><U+2019>u<U+2019>ll<U+00E1>h]] to spread his message around the world that "The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens." It has its members in nearly every nation, ethnic group, culture, profession, and social or economic background. Its reach is stated to cover four million people in 166 independent countries and 48 territories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bahai.org/|title=The Bahai faith|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=The web site of the bahai international community}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangalorebest.com/discoverbangalore/sightseeing/religion/sikh/bhavan.asp. |title= Baha'i Bhavan|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> Finding  a unifying vision of the nature and purpose of life and of the future of society is the main goal of all Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED>s.

==Jews and the Chabad==
The [[Jewish]] presence in Bangalore has been traced to a house dating to at least the early 20th century, called the Ruben House, on the main Old Guard road near Safina Plaza, where a [[Mezuza]] is displayed (a small case containing the [[Shema]], a passage from the [[Bible]] handwritten on a piece of parchment, that expresses the basic precept of [[Jewish faith]]). It belongs to the Rubin Moses family, the only family out of the five families traced to pre&ndash;independence time who still live in Bangalore; the other four families have migrated. [[Ezer Weizmann]], the former president of [[Israel]] (from 1993&ndash;2000) visited this family in Bangalore in 1997 and reminisced of the old times when he had served in Bangalore during World War II in the [[Royal Air Force]] of the [[British Armed Forces]].   Apart from the Ruben house, two other Jewish homes traced in Bangalore are the Hazelmore house on the Palace road and the Eastern Lodge in the Cavalry road. Another piece of interesting information reported is that M.Benjamin author of the book "The Mysteries of Israel's Ten Lost Tribes and the Legend of Jews in India" is residing in Bangalore since 2001.<ref name = Bang>{{cite web|url=http://www.flipkart.com/multiple-city-edited-aditi-de/0143100254-xow3figq4b |work=In Search of the Star of David by Nemichandra, Part V, Article 31, pages 174-183| title=Multiple City: Writings On Bangalore|author = Aditi De|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher= Penguin Books India, New Delhi| year=2008 }}</ref>

A [[cemetery]] on [[Mysore]] road, also established at the beginning of the 20th century, by Subedar Nowgaokar, a [[Beni]] [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Jew]], at a site donated to him by the [[Maharaja of Mysore]], is also a witness to the Jewish history in Bangalore.<ref name = Bang/>

In another part of the city in the European [[cemetery]] located on [[Hosur]] Road, two Jewish graves have been identified in the European Cemetery, one is  of T M. Horvitz, (b. Australia in Runoleff, d. Bangalore on 20 June 1898 with a  headstone of granite stone, engraved in [[Hebrew language]] and the other is of Rose Hickey (d. on 9 February 1917, aged 48 years).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishgen.org/cemetery/asia-pac-ind/india.html|title=India: The Jewish Community |accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher= International Association of Jewish Genealogical Societies - Cemetery Project}}</ref>

As of 2005, the Jewish community (mostly belonging to the [[Information Technology]] (IT) sector) living and visiting Bangalore, though a small group, intends to establish a [[Chabad]] in Bangalore, as proposed by two visiting rabbinical students who have been traveling in different parts of India to be in contact with the Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bangalore/Chabad_Jewish_house_to_be_ready_in_two_weeks/articleshow/3794145.cms|title=Chabad Jewish house to be ready in two weeks|accessdate=2009-03-20|publisher=The Times of India|date=2008-12-05}}</ref> The rabbis are members of  a global organization called Chabad LuBavitch located in New York with representatives across the world. The Rabbi students are traveling across India equipped with religious paraphernalia such as Tefellin and Mezuzous to preach to the small community of Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1191595.cms|title= Rabbi students are here to network Jews|accessdate=2009-03-12|publisher= The Times of India |date=2005-08-04}}</ref>.
