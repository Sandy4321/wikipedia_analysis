"'''This Love'''" is a song by the American [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Maroon 5]]. The song was written by frontman [[Adam Levine]] for their debut album ''[[Songs About Jane]]'' (2002). The track is built around a piano-led strut, which is immediately followed by synth percussions, a repeating guitar sound, and wry falsetto.

The song's lyrics are based on Adam Levine's break-up with a former girlfriend. He revealed that the song was written in the "most emotionally trying time" in his life.<ref name="tattoo" /> He also describes some of the lyrics in the song as sexual.<ref name="adam" /> "This Love" was well-received by music critics, who noted the track's musicscape. It was released on January 27, 2004 as the second single off ''Songs About Jane''.

The single entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's component charts, including reaching the number one spot on the [[Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks]] chart. The music video was met with controversy, regarding extended intimate scenes between Levine and his then-girlfriend. "This Love" helped Maroon 5 win the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]] and was the third most played song of 2004. The song won [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards|2006 Grammy Awards]], and, to date, is one of Maroon 5's most successful songs.<ref name="room" />

==Background==
"This Love" was the second single off of Maroon 5's 2002 debut album ''[[Songs About Jane]]''. In an interview with [[MTV News]] in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist [[Adam Levine]] revealed that he wrote the song the day his girlfriend moved away when they broke up.<ref name="moss">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457217/20020827/maroon_5.jhtml|title=Maroon 5 Aspire To Inspire Sexuality, Crying|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2002-08-27|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> In another interview, Levine revealed that the song was written in the "most emotionally trying time" in his life. He also added, "I was in a relationship that was ending, but I was really excited on the other end because the band was about to go make the record and I was ecstatic to go in the studio. She was literally leaving town within days of me writing the lyrics to 'This Love,' so I was in prime emotional condition to write a song with that kind of conflict."<ref name="tattoo">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1477138/20030821/maroon_5.jhtml|title=Tattooed, Request-Line-Ringing Fans Afford Maroon 5 Another Video|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2003-08-21|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', when asked about the lyrics "Keep her coming every night" and "Sinking my fingertips into every inch of you", Levine said: "Yep, that's sexual, all right. I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit. I thought the more explicit I got without being totally explicit was a nice approach. The little girls would enjoy them, and it would go right over my grandparents' heads. But it would hit my ex-girlfriend like a ton of bricks. It was perfect."<ref name="adam" /> He also comments on how MTV played an edited version of the song for the music video, with the word "[[Orgasm|coming]]" edited out of the line "keep her coming every night".<ref name="rs" /> Levine noted, "MTV has now edited the language. They won't let me say, 'Keep her coming every night', and they took the sinking out of 'sinking my fingertips'. It's like fucking communist China. It's totally bizarre."<ref name="adam">{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/maroon5/articles/story/5937291/qa_adam_levine|title=Q&A: Adam Levine|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|date=2004-03-24|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

==Reception==
[[Image:Maroon 5 - This Love live.jpg|thumb|right|Adam Levine singing "This Love" during the band's 2007 tour]]
The song received positive reception from critics. In the ''Rolling Stone'' review of the album, critic Christian Hoard wrote: "Adam Levine's urban-romantic swoonings work best when his band really gets up on the good foot, as on 'This Love', which uses piano and James Brown-like guitars to create a foundation on which Levine can obsess about beauty (including his own)."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/maroon5/albums/album/321138/review/5941040/songs_about_jane|title=Maroon 5: Songs About Jane|last=Hoard|first=Christian|date=2003-03-11|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> Jason Thompson of [[PopMatters]] noted that on the songs "This Love" and "Must Get Out", keyboardist [[Jesse Carmichael]] "manages to conjure up both the productions of Britney Spears and The New Radicals respectively".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/m/maroon5-songs.shtml|title=Maroon 5: Songs About Jane|last=Thompson|first=Jason|date=2002-06-25|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> C. Spencer Beggs of [[University of Notre Dame#Student-run media|''The Observer'']] wrote: "The second track, 'This Love', is sure follow. The two singles ['[[Harder to Breathe]]' and 'This Love']  are the most poppy on the album, showing off Maroon 5's characteristic clean, crisp and upbeat sound."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2003/10/16/Scene/Songs.About.Jane.An.Album.With.Music.And.Message-529827.shtml|title=Songs About Jane, an album with music and message|last=Beggs|first=C.

It might make a foot tap, a head nod or even a booty shake if played at a loud volume."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailylobo.com/media/storage/paper344/news/2003/07/31/Culture/Maroon.5.Falls.Short.Of.Their.Influences-449101.shtml|title=Maroon 5 falls short of their influences|last=Beresky|first=Sam|date=2003-07-31|work=[[University of New Mexico|Daily Lobo]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

In May 2004, musician [[John Mayer]] told ''Rolling Stone'' that he liked the band's album ''[[Songs About Jane]]''. Mayer was also positive towards the song. "Once I heard 'This Love,' it was a light-fuse/stand-back kind of situation. It's one of those perfect songs you always hope to write."<ref name="rs" /> The single also strengthened Maroon 5's appeal, and helped position them as one of the year's break-out bands in 2004.<ref name="room" /> It has since been remixed by [[Kanye West]], titled "This Love (Kanye West remix)", in May 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486989/20040513/maroon_5.jhtml|title=Maroon 5 Turn To Kanye West For 'This Love' Remix; Record Track For Spidey|last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|date=2004-05-13|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> The band released an [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[1.22.03.Acoustic]]'', which features "This Love", however, in an acoustic version.<ref name="steamy">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488202/20040607/maroon_5.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Maroon 5 Plan To Keep It Hot And Steamy In Next Video|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2004-06-07|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=2009-05-05}}</ref> The song was featured in the video game ''[[Guitar Hero: On Tour series|Guitar Hero: On Tour]]'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,373002,00.html|title=For Those About to Rock, Wii Salute You|last=Lammers|first=Dirk|date=2008-06-30|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>

The music video for "This Love" was directed by [[Sophie Muller]]. The video combines performance footage from the band in a courtyard in a Mexican soundstage and scenes of Adam Levine parting ways with a woman.<ref name="tattoo"/> According to Levine, the concept behind the music video was based on [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. "An overt sexuality confuses people, too.

The music video for "This Love" also features Levine and his then-girlfriend, model Kelly McKee, in extended intimate scenes. The video used creative camera angles and Kelly wore a minimalist G-string to show as much as possible without actually revealing any of the couple's genitalia (especially the woman's breasts, which are never seen throughout the video), thereby avoiding possible [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] action.<ref>{{YouTube|l_CqMFKak1c|Uncensored music video for "This Love"}}</ref> A version of the video where a stream of [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] flowers cover up more was created for more conservative markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/maroon-5/95960/this-love.jhtml#artist=1230385|title=This Love&nbsp;<U+2014> Maroon 5 - Music Video|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2009-05-07}}</ref> When asked about the video, Levine said: "It was surprisingly not weird and surprisingly not sexual.
