{{History_of_Australia/States}}
The '''history of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]''' as an [[Territory (administrative division)|administrative division]] of Australia began after the [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901, when it was created in law as the site for Australia's capital city [[Canberra]]. The region has a long prior history of human habitation before the Territory's creation, however, with evidence of  [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] settlement dating back at least 21,000 years. The region formed the traditional lands associated with the Ngambri People and several other [[Australian Aboriginal languages|linguistic groups]], an association known through both early European settler accounts and the [[oral history|oral histories]] of the peoples themselves.  Following the colonisation of Australia by the British, the 19th century saw the initial European exploration and settlement of the area and their encounters with the local indigenous peoples, beginning with the first explorations in 1820 and shortly followed by the first European settlements in 1824. At the outset the region was dominated by large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing, which had been granted to free settlers that had arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom and other European countries. These large properties would later be broken up and subdivided in accordance with changes to [[land tenure]] arrangements, smaller farms and urban developments becoming more common. 

In 1908, the region was cast into the national consciousness when it was selected as the site of the nation's future capital city. The Territory was formally ceded to the [[Government of Australia]] by the [[Government of New South Wales]] in 1909 and additional land at [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]] was also surrendered to the Commonwealth for the establishment of a sea port for the capital. It officially came under government control as the ''Federal Capital Territory'' on 1 January 1911. The planning and construction of Canberra followed, with the [[Parliament of Australia]] finally moving there in 1927. The Territory officially became the Australian Capital Territory in 1938. The city of Canberra developed and expanded to accommodate the Australian federal government, while the surrounding area has been developed to support the city, including the construction of dams, the establishment of plantation forests and the creation of [[protected areas of the Australian Capital Territory|protected areas]]. The political development of the Territory began in 1949, when it was given its first representative in the [[Parliament of Australia]], and was completed when it became an autonomous territory when self-government was granted in 1988.

The Ngambri People are the custodians of the land that includes the Territory, whose association with the area is known through both early European settler accounts and the [[oral history|oral histories]] of the people themselves. Other groups known to have been active in the region and in the surrounding areas include the [[Ngarigo]] Moolingoolah Monaroo to the south and south-east of the Australian Capital Territory; the [[Gundungurra]], the Pagong and Parramarragoo associated with lands to the northeast; the Ngunawal to the north and the Ngurmal to the west. These indigenous Australian groups were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, whose oral traditions maintained and explained their connections with the landscape, the cultural significance of particular features, and their account of their historical identities. Many of these traditions are documented, and from what can be reconstructed from evidence obtained from remaining arch<U+00E6>ological sites, there is an adequate record of the history of the local indigenous peoples prior to European exploration and settlement.

==Exploration==
In 1788 the British landed at [[Sydney Cove]], and the European settlement of Australia began.<ref name="af43">''Australian Flags'', p. 43.</ref> As the colony expanded more land was needed to grant to free settlers for farming.<ref name="g1">Gillespie, p. 1.</ref> Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south, including one to find an overland route from [[Sydney]] to [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]],<ref name="g3-8"/> an area which would later be incorporated into the Territory as its only coastal possession. In 1818 [[Charles Throsby]], [[Hamilton Hume]], [[James Meehan]] and William Kearns set out to find that route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.<ref name="g3-8">Gillespie, pp. 3&ndash;8.</ref> The 1820s saw further exploration in the Canberra area, associated with the construction of a road from Sydney to the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] plains, supervised by Throsby. Hearing about rivers in the south from the local Aborigines, in 1820 Throsby, his convict assistant [[Joseph Wild]] and James Vaughan set off to explore the Canberra region (which they described as the ''Limestone Plains''), also discovering the [[Yass River]].<ref name="p5">Fitzgerald, p. 5.</ref><ref name="w10-12">Wigmore, pp. 10&ndash;12.</ref> A second expedition was mounted, and Charles Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the [[Molonglo River|Molonglo]] (Ngambri) and [[Queanbeyan River]] (Jullergung) Rivers and were the first Europeans to camp at the site.<ref name="p5"/> In 1821 Charles Throsby mounted a third expedition and found the [[Murrumbidgee River]].<ref name="g3-8"/><ref name="p5"/>

Joseph Wild was employed by Brigade Major John Ovens and Captain Mark Currie in 1823 to guide them to the Murrumbidgee. They travelled south along the river and named the area now known as Tuggeranong ''Isabella's Plain''.<ref name="g8">Gillespie, p. 8.</ref> Unable to cross the river near the current site of [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]], they continued on to the Monaro Plains. The last expedition in the region was undertaken by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] in 1824.<ref name="p5"/><ref name="g8"/> Cunningham's reports verified that the region was suitable for grazing, and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.<ref name = "ABS 1931">Watson, F. 1931.

==European settlement==
[[Image:ACT historic buildings map-MJC2.png|thumb|250px|Significant homesteads, structures and settlements in the ACT prior to 1909.]]

When the [[Nineteen Counties|limits of location]] for settlement in [[New South Wales]] were determined, the Limestone Plains were authorised for settlement by British settlers and settlers of other European origins.<ref name="w10-11">Wigmore, pp. 10&ndash;11.</ref> The first land grant in the area was made to Joshua John Moore in 1823,<ref name="g9">Gillespie, p. 8.</ref> and European settlement in the area began in 1824 with the construction of a homestead, on what is now the Acton peninsula, by stockmen employed by him.<ref name="w10-12"/> Moore formally purchased the site in 1826 and named the property ''Canberry'', or ''Canberra'',<ref name="p12">Fitzgerald, p. 12.</ref> although he never visited the site. His 4[[Square metre|&nbsp;km<U+00B2>]] claim covered much of the future North Canberra.<ref name="w10-12"/> Adjacent to the eastern boundary on Moore's claim was land occupied by [[James Ainslie (pastoralist)|James Ainslie]] on behalf of [[Robert Campbell (Australian landowner)|Robert Campbell]], which was known as [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]].<ref name="p7">Fitzgerald, p. 7.</ref> John Palmer was granted land in the region which was taken up by his son George Palmer in 1826.<ref name="p10-11">Fitzgerald, pp. 10&ndash;11.</ref> He established ''Palmerville'' near [[Ginninderra Creek]] in 1829, and the "Squire" at Gungahlin was completed in 1861. Ginninderra Village was the site of first school, which operated from 1844 to 1848.<ref name="g78"/> The region's second school opened at Duntroon, adjacent [[St John the Baptist Church, Reid|St John's Church]].{{Fact|date=August 2008}} St John's was Canberra's first church; it was consecrated and opened for use in 1845.<ref name="g78">Gillespie, p. 78.</ref><ref name="p17">Fitzgerald, p. 17.</ref>

The region situated ten kilometres south of the Molonglo River and known today as the [[Tuggeranong]] Plains, was settled in the late 1820s, officially beginning with Peter Murdoch in 1827.<ref name="g12">Gillespie, p. 12.</ref> The Waniassa Homestead (also known as Tuggeranong Homestead) was completed in 1836 by John McQuoid, and the first buildings of the Lanyon estate, owned by John Lanyon and James Wright, were built in 1838.<ref name="g20-22">Gillespie, pp. 20&ndash;22.</ref> [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] was settled in 1834;{{Fact|date=August 2008}} the homestead in this area was named ''[[Cuppacumbalong Homestead|Cuppacumbalong]]'', and was established by James Wright in 1839.<ref name="g29">Gillespie, p. 29.</ref> Tharwa is the oldest official settlement in the Australian Capital Territory, having being proclaimed in 1862.<ref name = "ABS 1931"/><ref name="g130">Gillespie, p. 130.</ref>

Further south into the area that is now a part of the [[Namadgi National Park]]. The ''Naas'' and ''Orroral'' stations in the [[Naas River|Naas]] and [[Orroral River|Orroral]] river valleys were built in 1836.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} During the 1830s [[Garrett Cotter]] inhabited the [[Cotter River]] Valley so named because of his long association with it. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established.<ref name="g29"/> Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s; the Gudgenby Homestead was also built around this time. By 1848 most of the major valleys of the Namadgi area had been settled.

Convict labour was widely used in the region,<ref name="g12"/> and the first [[bushranger]]s in the region were runaway convicts. [[John Tennant]] was the earliest and best-known bushranger of the region,<ref name="g13"/> and lived in a hideout on a mountain behind Tharwa, now known as Mt Tennant.<ref name="w14"/> From 1827 he raided the local homesteads stealing stock, food and possessions until his arrest in 1828.<ref name="g13">Gillespie, p. 13.</ref> He was later hung for his crimes in Sydney. The lawlessness of the region led to the appointment of the first resident magistrate on November 28, 1837. The magistrate oversaw legal matters and issued liquor licenses to several establishments, the first of which was the Oaks Estate in 1841. A significant influx of population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s [[Australian gold rushes|goldrushes]], particularly the Kiandra rush of 1859 to 1860.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The gold rushes saw the establishment of communication between Sydney and the region by way of the [[Cobb and Co|Cobb & Co]] coaches, which transported [[mail]] and passengers.<ref name="w20">Wigmore, p. 20.</ref> The first [[post office]] opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and a second at Lanyon in 1860.<ref name="g110-111">Gillespie, pp. 110&ndash;111.</ref> Bushranger activity continued with the gold rushes:<ref name="w20"/> Australian-born bushrangers [[Ben Hall]] and the [[Clarke brothers]] were active in the area, targeting [[mail coach]]es and gold shipments.<ref>Gillespie, pp. 112&ndash;113, 134&ndash;137.</ref> 

[[Image:Tharwa Bridge construction-O'Hanlon.jpg|thumb|Construction of Tharwa Bridge 1893]]
[[Terence Aubrey Murray]] was born in Ireland in 1810 and moved to Sydney, Australia with his family in 1827.<ref name="p36">Fitzgerald, p. 36.</ref> In 1837 he acquired the property of ''[[Government House, Canberra|Yarralumla]]'' and moved to the area.<ref name="p6">Fitzgerald, p. 6.</ref> He became the first [[Parliament of New South Wales|parliamentary]] representative for the district from 1860. The [[Robertson Land Acts]] and the [[Closer Settlement Acts]] altered the mechanism for granting [[land tenure]] and brought about the break-up of large properties in New South Wales. With the changes in land tenure, the economic focus of the region shifted from [[pastoralism|grazing]] to [[agriculture]]. 

During colonial times, present-day Canberra was occupied by various local communities referred to by local names such as [[Ginninderra]], [[Molonglo Plains|Molonglo]] and [[Tuggeranong]]. The region was also called the [[Queanbeyan]]/[[Yass]] district, which were the two largest towns in close proximity to Canberra. The villages of [[Ginninderra]] and [[Tharwa]] developed to service the local farming communities. In 1882 the first allotments the village of Hall, named after early pastoralist Henry Hall were sold. <ref name="g180">Gillespie, p. 180.</ref> It was by 1901 an established town with two stores, a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler and a dairy.<ref name="g290-291">Gillespie, pp. 290&ndash;291.</ref> 

In 1886 agronomist [[William Farrer]], a resident of Cuppacumbalong, built Lambrigg on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River south of present day [[Tuggeranong]]. Lambrigg was a research station where he experimented with rust- and drought-resistant [[wheat]]; the varieties he bred were widely used by Australian wheat growers, and he was later credited with establishing the Australian wheat industry.<ref name="w20">Wigmore, p. 20.</ref><ref name="p63-65">Fitzgerald, pp. 63&ndash;65.</ref><ref name="g182">Gillespie, p. 182.</ref> Tharwa Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge in the region, was opened in 1895 and was the first bridge across the Murrumbidgee River.<ref name="g118-120">Gillespie, pp. 188&ndash;180.</ref> By 1911 when the region came under federal control, the population had grown to 1,714 settlers.<ref name = "ABS 1988">Australian Bureau of Statistics. 1988.

==Cultural relations==
During the first 20 years of European settlement, there was only limited contact between the settlers and Aborigines, and reported acts of hostility were minimal, however there were some recorded confrontations. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the [[Brindabella Ranges|Brindabellas]] in 1849 and attempted to set up a cattle farm. His livestock was slaughtered by the local Aboriginals and he was driven back out of the mountains. In 1859 gold was discovered at [[Kiandra, New South Wales|Kiandra]], the resulting rush of prospectors into the area through the Brindabellas and the mountains to the west of the ACT leading to the further decimation of the Aboriginal population. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, such Aboriginal communities as could still be found were few in number and widely dispersed. 

As the encroachment of European settlement continued, numbers of surviving Aboriginal families were drawn to the farms and townships by the opportunity to work or receive handouts of food and blankets.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Over the succeeding years, the Ngunnawal and other local indigenous peoples effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life.<ref name="g149">Gillespie, p. 149.</ref> Those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to the local settlements or were relocated to more distant Aboriginal reserves which were set up by the NSW government in the latter part of the 19th century. The children of mixed European-Aboriginal families were generally expected to assimilate into the settlement communities. The Ngambri People were subsequently often considered to be "extinct";<ref>Sekavs, M. 1985. Aboriginal history in the 19th century. In ''ACT heritage seminars'', Fitzgerald, A. ed., ACT Heritage Committee, Canberra ISBN 0-642-09721-6</ref> however, in a situation parallel to that of the [[Tasmanian Aborigines]], people with claim to Ngambri ancestry continue to maintain their connection with and identity as Ngambri. There have however been some instances of dispute within the community itself over who is properly considered to be a member of the contemporary Ngambri community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/hansard/2001/week07/2038.htm |title=Hansard transcript- Legislative Assembly for the ACT (19 June 2001) |publisher=Hansard.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The Ngambri community  remain active and ambitious to further restore their cultural heritage.

==Search for a capital city location==
[[Image:Senators at Tumut-Luke.jpg|thumb|Senators inspecting a possible site for the new capital at [[Tumut, New South Wales|Tumut]]]]
The district's change from a New South Wales rural area to the national capital began with the debates over [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in the early 20th century.<ref name="w24">Wigmore, p. 24.</ref>  At the time [[Melbourne]] was Australia's largest city and was assumed the frontrunner for the national capital. The western colonies&mdash;Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria&mdash;backed Melbourne. However, NSW (with the largest colony population) and (to a lesser extent) Queensland, favoured Sydney&mdash;which was longer established than Melbourne. Either of these two colonial cities might have eventually been acceptable to the smaller states, but the [[Sydney-Melbourne rivalry]] was such that neither city would agree to the other one becoming capital.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Eventually, a compromise was reached: Melbourne would be the interim seat of government (but not referred to as the "capital") until a location for the capital was agreed.<ref name="w24"/> Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] specified that the national capital must be "within the state of New South Wales", but no closer than 100&nbsp;miles (160&nbsp;km) from Sydney.<ref name="p92">Fitzgerald, p. 92.</ref><ref>Wigmore, pp. 24, 35.</ref>

The search for an appropriate site began in earnest in 1903, when the new Federal government instituted a commission to investigate potential sites. The commissioners could not agree on a single site,<ref name="p92"/> but recommended several&mdash;[[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], [[Tumut, New South Wales|Tumut]] or [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], in that order. The House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of [[Bombala, New South Wales|Bombala]].<ref name="p92"/><ref>Wigmore, pp. 30&ndash;35.</ref>
[[Image:Surveyors camp Canberra.jpg|left|thumb|The Federal Capital survey camp was established circa 1909. An extensive survey of the ACT was completed by Charles Scrivener and his team in 1915.]]
A compromise was eventually reached between the two houses and, with the passage of the ''[[Seat of Government Act 1904]]''<ref name="g236">Gillespie, p. 236.</ref>, the township of [[Dalgety, New South Wales|Dalgety]], located on the [[Snowy River]], was the national capital-designate.  A stand-off ensued between the New South Wales and Federal governments, with NSW unwilling to cede the amount of territory the federal government demanded. Finally, in 1906 the state agreed to cede the desired amount of territory, as long as it was in the [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]-[[Canberra]] region<ref name="p92"/>, this site being closer to Sydney.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Following a tour of the region by several Senators and Members of the Commonwealth Parliament in 1908, the Federal government repealed the 1904 Act, passing the new ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'', which approved a capital in the Yass-Canberra region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=110 |title=National Archives of Australia - Seat of Government Act 1908 (Cth) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref name="p93">Fitzgerald, p. 93.</ref>

Government Surveyor [[Charles Scrivener]] was deployed to the region in the same year in order to map out a specific site and, after an extensive search, settled upon the present location,<ref name="p93"/> about 300 kilometres south-west of Sydney in the foothills of the Australian Alps.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Two people who had campaigned particularly strongly for the federal capital to be in the Canberra area and against the Dalgety site were John Gale,<ref name="g242">Gillespie, p. 242.</ref> the publisher of the ''Queanbeyan Age'',<ref name="g172">Gillespie, p. 172.</ref> and federal politician [[King O'Malley]].<ref>Wigmore, pp. 31&ndash;33.</ref>

In 1909 New South Wales transferred the land for the creation of the Federal Capital Territory to federal control though two pieces of legislation, the ''[[Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909]]'' and the ''[[Seat of Government Surrender Act 1909]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=93 |title=National Archives of Australia - Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909 (Cth) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=121 |title=National Archives of Australia - Seat of Government Surrender Act 1909 (NSW) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The Act transferred [[Crown land]] in the counties of [[Murray County, New South Wales|Murray]] and [[Cowley County, New South Wales|Cowley]] to the Commonwealth,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} which amounted to an area about 2,330&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and eight parcels of land near [[Jervis Bay Territory|Jervis Bay]].<ref>Wigmore, pp. 43&ndash;44.</ref> All private land in the surrendered area had to be bought by the Commonwealth. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act also gave the Commonwealth rights to use and control the waters of the [[Queanbeyan River|Queanbeyan]] and [[Molonglo River]]s.

In 1910 the ''[[Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910]]'' created the legal framework for the Territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=111 |title=National Archives of Australia - Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910 (Cth) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The act specified that laws in the Territory could be made by the Commonwealth and that Ordinances could be made by the Governor-General,<ref name="gi2">Gibbney, p. 2.</ref> and placed the ACT under the jurisdiction of the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|New South Wales Supreme Court]]. The Act also specifies that no land in the Territory can be held by [[Fee simple|freehold]],<ref name="gi2"/> creating the [[leasehold]] [[land tenure]] system that exists today, and is the only land tenure system of its kind in Australia.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} When the Act came into force on 1 January 1911, control of the Territory was officially assumed by the Commonwealth. This Act remained the constitutional basis for law-making in the ACT for nearly 90 years.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The [[Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Home Affairs]], [[King O'Malley]], who was responsible for the legislation creating the ACT, also introduced a bill in 1910 making the ACT an alcohol-free area;<ref name="gi2">Gibbney, p. 62.</ref><ref name="w49">Wigmore, p. 49.</ref> this bill was passed by the Federal parliament and the law was not repealed until 1928.<ref>Gibbney, pp. 148&nddash;149.</ref> Until that time local residents travelled to [[Queanbeyan]], just across the New South Wales border, to drink on Saturday.<ref>Wigmore, pp. 120&ndash;121.</ref><ref>Gibbney, pp. 17&ndash;18.</ref> In 1938 the Territory was formally renamed the Australian Capital Territory.<ref name="g194">Gibbney, p. 194.</ref>

The ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' and the New South Wales ''[[Seat of Government Surrender Act 1915]]'' created a [[Jervis Bay Territory|Territory of Jervis Bay]], deemed part of the Federal Capital Territory and with all laws of the Territory applicable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=111 |title=National Archives of Australia - Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

King O'Malley successfully pushed through legislation that restricted all land holdings in the new territory to [[leasehold]], rather than [[Freehold (real property)|freehold]]. This was intended to avoid land speculation and give the national government, as the lessor, greater control over development. (As of 2006 all land in the ACT is held on 99 year crown leases.) This too was adopted by the national Parliament. The decision to opt for leasehold over freehold had major consequences for the few thousand local inhabitants, particularly farmers and graziers, who held freehold title over very productive agricultural  land and expected fair and reasonable compensation. <ref>Newman Chris (2004), ''Gold Creek, Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage'', Gold Creek Homestead Working Group.</ref>

The resumption of land was a test of the Federal Government's goodwill towards graziers, and King O<U+2019>Malley restated the government<U+2019>s position at public meetings. Almost without exception, land valuations fell far short of freeholders<U+2019> expectations when compared to equivalent land across the border in NSW. The Minister suggested that landowners accept the departmental valuation or hire a Queens Counsel and appeal to the High Court.<ref>Brennan F (1971), ''Canberra in crisis; a history of land tenure and leasehold administration'', Dalton Publishing.</ref>

After Griffin was removed, the [[Federal Capital Advisory Committee]] was established to advise the government of the construction efforts.<ref name="p115">Fitzgerald, p. 115.</ref> The Committee had limited success meeting its goals;{{Fact|date=August 2008}} however, the chairman, [[John Sulman]], was instrumental in applying the ideas of the [[garden city movement]] to Griffin's plan.<ref name="p115"/> The Committee was replaced in 1925 by the [[Federal Capital Commission]].<ref name="p128">Fitzgerald, p. 128.</ref> The role of the FCC was to prepare Canberra for the transfer of the Commonwealth Parliament and the public service from Melbourne to Canberra.<ref name="gi111">Gibbney, p. 111.</ref> The Federal Government officially relocated to the ACT from Melbourne on the formal opening of the [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Provisional Parliament House]] on 9 May 1927.<ref name="p130">Fitzgerald, p. 130.</ref> Among the new Parliament's first acts was the repeal of the prohibition laws. At first the [[Civil service|public service]] remained based in Melbourne, the various departments' headquarters only gradually moving to Canberra over the space of several years.<ref>Gibbney, pp. 111&ndash;120.</ref> From 1938 to 1957 the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra; however, the NCPDC did not have executive power,<ref>Wigmore, p. 113.</ref> and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without the Committee's consultation. A few major buildings were constructed during this period of NCPDC responsibility,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} such as the [[Australian War Memorial]], which opened in 1941.<ref name="p148">Fitzgerald, p. 148.</ref> However, financial and labour constraints limited major growth, and as such the development of the city was sporadic until the conclusion of [[World War II]].
[[Image:Old and New Parliament House Canberra.jpg|thumb|Three of Canberra's best-known landmarks, [[Lake Burley Griffin]] (foreground), [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Old]] and [[Parliament House, Canberra|New Parliament House]]]]
After World War II there was a shortage of housing and office space in Canberra,<ref>Gibbney, pp. 231&ndash;237.</ref> so a Senate Select Committee hearing was held in 1954 to address its development requirements. This Committee recommended the creation of a single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the NCPDC was replaced by the [[National Capital Development Commission]] in 1957. The NCDC oversaw the construction of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and the completion of Griffin's [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] in 1964.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975.<ref>Sparke, pp. 103&ndash;104, 145, 188, 323.</ref> To accommodate the influx of residents, the NCDC oversaw the release of new residential land though the creation of new town centres:<ref name="s154">Sparke, p. 154.</ref> [[Woden Valley|Woden]] opened in 1964, followed by [[Belconnen]] in 1966,<ref name="s180">Sparke, p. 180.</ref> [[Weston Creek]] in 1969{{Fact|date=August 2008}} and [[Tuggeranong]] in 1973.<ref name = "ABS 1988"/><ref name="p167">Fitzgerald, p. 167.</ref> A new [[National Library of Australia|National Library]] was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle to be followed by the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia|National Gallery]] and finally a new [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in 1988.<ref name="s116">Sparke, p. 116.</ref><ref name="p138">Fitzgerald, p. 138.</ref> The NCDC was disbanded in 1988, with most of its staff and planning authority transferred to the newly created ACT government and the new [[National Capital Authority]], which was established to oversee Commonwealth interests in development of the national capital.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Canberra has continued to grow with the further release of residential land in [[Gungahlin]] in the 1990s.<ref name="p55">Fitzgerald, p. 55.</ref>

==Development outside Canberra==
[[Image:CotterDam.jpg|thumb|The Cotter Dam in December 2005, surrounding country still showing the effects of the [[2003 Canberra bushfires|2003 bushfires]].]]
A significant priority for the establishment of Canberra was the construction of water storage facilities. Cotter Dam was the first dam built on the [[Cotter River]];<ref name="g11">Gibbney, p. 11.</ref> construction on this 18.5&nbsp;m high concrete gravity dam{{Fact|date=August 2008}} was started in 1912 and finished in 1915.<ref name="g11"/> Its height was raised to 31&nbsp;m in 1951. [[Chlorination]] of Canberra's water began at the [[Cotter Dam]] in 1955; water treatment was moved to the [[Mt Stromlo Water Treatment Plant]] after 1967.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} Two additional dams were built on the Cotter: the [[Bendora Dam]],<ref name="s184">Sparke, p. 184.</ref> a double-curvature, concrete-arch dam, was completed in 1961; and the [[Corin Dam]], an earth and rock-fill embankment dam,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} was built in 1968.<ref name="s184"/> In 1979 [[Googong Dam]], the biggest dam that supplies the ACT,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} was built on the [[Queanbeyan River]] in New South Wales.<ref>??</ref>

Transport into and out of the ACT was also a priority for early development. In 1931 the [[Federal Highway (Australia)|Federal Highway]] linking the ACT to [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] was completed,<ref name="gi175">Gibbney, p. 175.</ref> and in 1936 an airfield was constructed at Duntroon. The only [[Canberra air disaster, 1940|air disaster]] to occur in the ACT{{Fact|date=August 2008}} happened on 13 August 1940, when Australia's chief military officer and three senior ministers in the Menzies Government, [[James Fairbairn]], [[Geoffrey Street]] and [[Henry Somer Gullett]], were killed when their plane crashed on the southern approach to Canberra.<!--railways need to go here--><ref>Gibbney, pp. 213&ndash;214.</ref>

A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was planned, but never constructed.<ref>Gibbney, pp. 58, 76.</ref> Several facilities were built in Jervis Bay including the [[Royal Australian Naval College]] (''HMAS Creswell'') built in 1913, the Jervis Bay Air Base Range, and a Botanic Gardens. In the 1970s a [[Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear reactor]] and a large industrial development including a steelworks, petrochemical and chemical industry, aluminium smelting, copper refining, quarrying and woodchip industries were planned, but neither were developed.

The native forest of the ACT was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes, especially during the boom following World War II. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the forests, and concern about water quality in the Cotter River catchment led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry in the Territory had begun in 1915, when [[Thomas Weston (horticulturalist)|T.C.G. Weston]] had begun trials of a number of species including ''[[Monterey Pine|Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mt Stromlo. Plantation forestry began in earnest in 1926 with 2&nbsp;km<U+00B2> planted annually around [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]] and [[Pierces Creek, Australian Capital Territory|Pierce's Creek]]. By 1938 the area planted yearly was 4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>, with the favourable benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment. In 1967 the Australian Government approved a plan for a total 160&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of plantation in the ACT, and by 1970 this goal had been achieved. The ease of access to the plantations has made them popular recreation areas for Canberrans. Throughout the 20th century, significant areas of plantation forest were periodically lost to bushfire, with major fires occurring in 1939, 1952, 1979, 1983, 2001 and [[2003 Canberra bushfires|2003]].<ref name = "McLeod">McLeod, R. 2003.

In 1936 about 8.1&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of forest was set aside in order to create the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]], and in 1939 a [[Koala]] enclose was built by the Institute of Anatomy. The government acquired land to establish a national park and fauna reserve in 1962, extending the park to 36.29&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and later further increased to its current size of 54.50&nbsp;km<U+00B2>. In 1969 the first wildlife displays were created, and in 1971 the park was officially gazetted. In 1984 the [[Namadgi National Park]] was declared. The park is 1059&nbsp;km<U+00B2> and makes up more than half of the Australian Capital Territory.

The Australian Government signed an agreement with the United States in 1960 for the establishment of satellite-tracking stations in the ACT. As a result of the agreement, three tracking stations were built in the ACT by [[NASA]].<ref name="w265">Wigmore, p. 265.</ref> The [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]] was officially opened on 19 March 1965 by then Prime Minister Sir [[Robert Menzies]], and is the only station still in operation in the ACT, communicating with interplanetary spacecraft.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The [[Orroral Valley Tracking Station]], which was for orbiting satellite support, opened in May 1965<ref name="w206">Wigmore, p. 206.</ref> in what is now part of [[Namadgi National Park]], but was closed down in 1985.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]], completed in December 1966, was a communications relay station for [[Project Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and interplanetary spacecraft between 1967<ref>Wigmore, p. 207.</ref> and 1981. In 1981 its 26&nbsp;m antenna was moved to the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.

==Government and the ACT==

The [[Australian Capital Territory Police]] was created in 1927,<ref name="s296">Sparke, p. 296.</ref> the same year the federal government moved to the ACT,{{Fact|date=August 2008}} and initially consisted of only eleven officers.<ref name="s296"/> The size of the force grew over subsequent decades with the development of Canberra, and maintained similar status to that of police forces in other states until 1979.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} In that year, the ACT Police merged with the Commonwealth Police and the [[Federal Narcotics Bureau]] to form the [[Australian Federal Police]], which were at the time responsible for law and order in Canberra.<ref name="s296"/> Since self-government was granted in 1988, the AFP has performed this under contract to the ACT government.

The ACT was given its first federal representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the [[Division of Australian Capital Territory]],<ref name="s289"/> under the 1948 Representation Act which increased the size of the House of Representatives.{{Fact|date=August 2008}} The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the Territory. In 1974, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory were each allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two, the [[Division of Canberra]] and [[Division of Fraser]].<ref name="s289">Sparke, p. 289.</ref> A third, the [[Division of Namadgi]], was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 after an updated assessment of changes to the regional demographic distribution. Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by the [[Australian Labor Party]], and the Senate seats have always been split one-to-one between the ALP and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]].

[[Image:Flag of the Australian Capital Territory.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of Australian Capital Territory]] was adopted in 1993 and features the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] and the [[Coat of Arms of Australian Capital Territory|Coat of Arms]].]]

From 1930, the ACT was administered by the ACT Advisory Council and the Minister for Territories, and from 1934 had its own [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Supreme Court]]. In 1974 the Council became a [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly|fully elected Legislative Assembly]], advising the Department of the Capital Territory, and in 1979 this became a House of Assembly of 18 elected members. Despite a 1978 referendum, in which Canberrans rejected self government by 63% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/act.php3 |title=Parliament@Work - At a Glance Australian Capital Territory |publisher=Parliament.curriculum.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> the sitting ACT Assembly was dissolved in 1986. In December 1988, the ACT was granted full self-government with the passage of the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=118 |title=National Archives of Australia - Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth) |publisher=Foundingdocs.gov.au |date=1988-12-06 |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> The [[Australian Capital Territory legislative election, 1989|first elections]] were held in February 1989, and the inaugural 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] moved into former public service buildings in [[London Circuit, Canberra|London Circuit]] and [[City Centre, Australian Capital Territory|Civic]] on 11 May 1989. The [[Australian Labor Party]] formed the ACT's first government, led by [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory|Chief Minister]] [[Rosemary Follett]], who made history as Australia's first female head of government. When self-government was granted, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], which had been considered a part of the ACT, became a separate territory administered by the Minister for Territories. Since 1992, members of the Assembly have been elected by the [[Single Transferable Vote|Hare-Clark]] proportional representation system, which replaced the previously used  modified [[D'Hondt method]].

Whereas the ACT's federal electorates have been mainly held by Labor, the Liberal Party has been able to gain some footing in the ACT Assembly, and formed government in seven out of the Assembly's 17-year history (to 2006). 

Since the 1993 creation of the National Native Title Tribunal, there have been four separate claims to [[Native Title]] lodged over alienated lands in the ACT by representatives of the [[Ngunnawal people|Ngunnawal communities]], in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. The first two of these were discontinued after reaching a Federal Court hearing, and the third was rejected as not meeting applicable provisions. The fourth claim is no longer active having been withdrawn. 

In 2001, the ACT government entered into a cooperative agreement with the Aboriginal community over the management of [[Namadgi National Park]], which constitutes approximately 46% of the ACT's total land area. This agreement no longer exists. 

In the 1990s, a number of activities which are or were illegal in other Australian states were legalised in the ACT. These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1989-8/default.asp |title=Film Classification (Amendment) Act 1989 |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1992-64/default.asp |title=Prostitution Act 1992 |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref> although brothels are only permitted to operate in the suburbs of [[Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory|Mitchell]] and [[Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory|Fyshwick]]. The personal use of [[cannabis]] was decriminalised in 1992 and abortion was decriminalised in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/1992-52/default.asp |title=Drugs of Dependence (Amendment) Act 1992 |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2002-24/default.asp |title=Crimes (Abolition of Offence of Abortion) Act 2002 |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-03}}</ref>

==Recent history==
[[Image:Mt Stromlo Obs1.jpg|thumb|Remains of a telescope dome at [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] after the [[2003 Canberra bushfires]]]]
The first years of the 21st century saw a period of extended drought in the ACT region, accompanied by several bushfires which caused widespread devastation. Over the 2001 Christmas period, five separate bushfires burnt over 16&nbsp;km<U+00B2> of forest in the ACT, including millions of dollars' worth of plantation pine forest.<ref>ACT Emergency Services Authority. [http://www.esb.act.gov.au/firebreak/Xmas_2001_article.html Christmas 2001 - The A.C.T. Bushfires]</ref> The drought conditions continued during the following years, <!--need to find out when the drought started--> and in 2003 the ACT burned again. The [[2003 Canberra bushfires|2003 bushfires]] damaged about 70% of the area of the ACT, including 99% of the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and significant areas of government-owned pine plantation. Four people were killed, 67 rural houses were destroyed, including 16 houses at [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], 12 at [[Pierces Creek, Australian Capital Territory|Pierces Creek]] and 414 houses in the outer suburbs of Canberra.<ref name = "McLeod"/> More than 200 other houses were damaged by the fires, and numerous buildings of historical significance were lost, including the Mt Franklin Chalet, which was built in 1937&ndash;38 for the Canberra Alpine Club and was the first club-built ski lodge in mainland Australia. Many other historic houses and huts in the Namadgi National Park were also lost. ''Nil Desperandum'' and ''Rock Valley Homestead'', the two historic houses at Tidbinbilla, were destroyed. Another significant loss was the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]], operated by the [[Australian National University]]. The dome which housed the observatory's Oddie telescope was built in 1911 and was the first federal building in the ACT.
