'''James Edward Carpenter''' (March 6, 1841 <U+2013> August 16, 1901) served in the [[Union Army]] in 1861 as a private in the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry. In 1862 he became a second lieutenant and progressed in rank to first lieutenant, captain, then a brevet major of volunteers due to gallantry. He later served his community and Philadelphia with honor as a business lawyer of high respect.

James E. Carpenter was a direct descendant (great-great-great-grandson) of the notable immigrant [[Samuel Carpenter]] (November 4, 1649 [[Horsham]], [[Sussex]], [[England]] - April 10, 1714 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) who came to [[United States|America]] in early 1683 by way of [[Barbados]].<ref name=Carpenters>{{cite web

James was the second eldest son of eight children born to Edward Carpenter 2nd and Anna Maria (Mary) Howey.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> He was born in [[Chesterfield]], [[Kent County, Maryland]] and in 1843 his family moved to [[Philadelphia]] where they attended Trinity Episcopal Church in West Philadelphia.<ref group="n" name="Church"> Trinity Episcopal Church, West Philadelphia, is now where the Mario Lanza Park is located. The Church once stood west of Second Street, between Catharine and Queen streets. This Church was consecrated in 1822, closed in 1908 and razed by 1917 with the new park "Queen Park" open in late 1918. The park was renamed on September 29, 1967 in memory of Mario Lanza (1921-1959) one of Philadelphia's most beloved signers and film stars.

==Civil War==
In 1861 he joined as a private the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry and in 1862 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.<ref name=Carpenters/> 

During the night of September 17/18, 1862, he was wounded seriously inside the elbow in the engagement at [[Philomont, Virginia]] on the advance at the end of the fighting at the [[Battle of Antietam]].<ref name=Carpenters/>

In the early evening of May 2, 1863, he was part of the heroic, but ultimately futile, charge of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry against Confederate [[Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson|General Jackson's]] Corp flanking attack during the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. His horse was shot from under him and of the five officers who rode at the head of the attacking column, he was one of only two who survived. This charge of Union Cavalry was not strong enough and only marginally slowed down the collapse of the right flank of the [[Union Army]] [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Joseph Hooker]]'s [[Army of the Potomac]]. Hooker had only left a token force of Cavalry with his main attack thinking they would not be needed in the woods. Hooker had sent 7,500 Cavalry troopers with Major General [[George Stoneman]] to raid behind the Confederate line into their supply and communications. [[Stoneman's Raid]], as it became known, ultimately failed in its main quest, but was a confidence builder for the Union Cavalry.<ref>[[Stephen W. Sears|Sears, Stephen W.]], ''Chancellorsville'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, ISBN 0-395-87744-X </ref>.

On June 29, 1863, he was selected and served on the staff of Brigadier General [[David McMurtrie Gregg|D. McMurtrie Gregg]], who was just given the command of the Second Cavalry Division, Cavalry Corps, under the reorganization by Major General [[George G. Meade]]. Brevet Major Carpenter for the next eighteen months excelled in this position providing good documentation and order.<ref name=Carpenters/>

==Post Civil War==

In October of 1865 he was admitted to the bar in Philadelphia.<ref> Surname Guide - Thomas Carpenter Genealogy, accessed July 29, 2009 at: http://www.surnameguide.com/carpenter/thomas_carpenter_genealogy.htm </ref>

He assisted in helping to establish the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] in Philadelphia during May of 1865. Later he became a companion of that order when the concern of conflict of interest was lifted.<ref name=Carpenters/>
