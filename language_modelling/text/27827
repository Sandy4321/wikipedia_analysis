The [[Battle of the Alamo]] left a large legacy.

==Alamo Mission==
{{main|Alamo Mission in San Antonio}}
Following the Mexican victory at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Mexican troops quartered in the [[Alamo Mission]].  As the Mexican army retreated from Texas following the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], they tore down many of the walls and burned the palisade which Crockett had defended. Within the next several decades, various buildings in the complex were torn down, and in 1849 a gable was added to the top of the chapel.<ref name=todish198>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 198.</ref> Today, the remnants of the Alamo are near the San Antonio town center.  The church building remains standing and serves as an official state shrine to the Texian<!-- Please note that 'Texian' is the correct contemporary spelling--> defenders.<ref name=gronemanbattle52/> As the 20th century began many Texans advocated razing the remaining building.  A wealthy rancher's daughter, Clara Driscoll, purchased the building to serve as a museum. The Texas Legislature later bought the property and appointed the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]] as permanent caretakers.<ref name=todish199>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 199.</ref> In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a [[cenotaph]], designed by [[Pompeo Coppini]] and erected in 1939, which commemorates the Texians<!-- Please note that 'Texian' is the correct contemporary spelling--> who died during the battle.<ref name=gronemanbattle56>Groneman (1998), p. 56.</ref> According to Bill Groneman's ''Battlefields of Texas'', the Alamo has become "the most popular tourist site in Texas".<ref name=gronemanbattle52>Groneman (1998), p. 52.</ref>

==Literature==
[[Image:John Henry Brown.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Henry Brown]] wrote the first history of the battle, which was published in 1843.]]
Many of the Mexican officers who participated in the battle left memoirs, although some were not written until decades after the battle. Among those who provided written accounts of the battle were [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]], [[Vicente Filisola]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Enrique de la Pe<U+00F1>a]], [[Jos<U+00E9> Juan S<U+00E1>nchez Navarro]], [[Juan N. Almonte]], and [[Francisco Becerra]].<ref name=nofi211>Nofi (1992), p. 211.</ref> Texians<!-- Please note that 'Texian' is the correct contemporary spelling--> [[Juan Segu<U+00ED>n]] and John Sutherland also left memoirs,<ref name=nofi212>Nofi (1992), p. 212.</ref> although some historians believe Sutherland was not at the Alamo and wrote his memoirs from hearsay.<ref name=lindley115>Lindley (2003), p. 115.</ref> The first report of the names of the Texian<!-- Please note that 'Texian' is the correct contemporary spelling--> victims of the battle came in the March 24, 1836 issue of the ''Telegraph and Texas Register''. The 115&nbsp;names on the list came from John Smith and Gerald Navan, who had left as couriers.<ref name=chariton180>Chariton (1990), p. 180.</ref>   In 1843 former [[Texas Ranger]] and amateur historian [[John Henry Brown]] wrote and published the first history of the battle, a pamphlet called ''The Fall of the Alamo''. He followed this in 1853 with a second pamphlet called ''Facts of the Alamo, Last Days of Crockett and Other Sketches of Texas''. No copies of the pamphlets have survived.<ref name=lindley106>Lindley (2003), p. 106.</ref> The next major treatment of the battle was Reuben Potter's ''The Fall of the Alamo'', published in ''The Magazine of American History'' in 1878. Potter based his work on interviews with many of the survivors of the Battle of the Alamo.<ref name=nofi211>Nofi (1992), p. 211.</ref><ref name=lindley106/> One of the most used secondary sources about the Alamo is Amelia W. Williams's doctoral [[dissertation]], "Critical Study of the Siege of the Alamo and of the Personnel of Its Defenders". Completed in 1931, it attempted to positively identify all of the Texians who died during the battle. Her list was used to choose the names carved into the cenotaph memorial in 1936.<ref name=lindley37>Lindley (2003), p. 37.</ref> Several historians, including Thomas Ricks Lindley, Thomas Lloyd Miller, and Richard G. Santos, believe her list included men who had not died at the Alamo.<ref name=lindley41>Lindley (2003), p. 41.</ref> Despite the errors in some of her work, Williams collect a large amount of information and her work serves as a starting point for many historians.<ref name=lindley68>Lindley (2008), p. 68.</ref> The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle was not published until 1948, when John Myers Myers's ''The Alamo'' was released.<ref name=cox>{{citation|last=Cox|first=Mike|title=Last of the Alamo big books rests with 'A Time to Stand'|newspaper=The Austin-American Statesman|date=March 6, 1998}}</ref>

==Film==
[[Image:Alamo replica.jpg|thumb|left|This replica of the Alamo is located at [[Alamo Village]]. It was built for the 1960 John Wayne film ''The Alamo''.]] 
According to Todish ''et al'', "there can be little doubt that most Americans have probably formed many of their opinions on what occurred at the Alamo not from books, but from the various movies made about the battle."<ref name=todish187>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 187.</ref> The first film version of the battle appeared in 1911, when [[Gaston Melies]] directed ''[[The Immortal Alamo]]'', which has since been lost. Through the next four decades several other movies were released, variously focusing on Davy Crocket, Almeron Dickinson, and Louis Rose. The Alamo achieved prominence on television in 1955 with ''Walt Disney's Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier'', which was largely based on myth.<ref name=nofi213>Nofi (1992), p. 213.</ref> In the early 1950s [[John Wayne]] began developing a film based on the Battle of the Alamo.  When he left his contract with [[Republic Pictures]] he was forced to leave behind a partial script. Republic Pictures had the script finished and developed into the 1955 movie ''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]''. Although the film had its historical inaccuracies, it was the most detailed of the films on the Texas Revolution.<ref name=todish188>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 188.</ref> Wayne continued to develop an Alamo movie, resulting in the 1960 film ''[[The Alamo (1960 film)|The Alamo]]'', starring Wayne as Davy Crockett. Although screenwriter [[James Edward Grant]] claimed to have done extensive historical research, according to Todish "there is not a single scene in ''The Alamo'' which corresponds to an historically verifiable incident", and historians [[James Frank Dobie|J. Frank Dobie]] and [[Lon Tinkle]] demanded that their names be removed from the credits as historical advisors.<ref name=todish188/> The set built for the movie, [[Alamo Village]], includes a replica of the Alamo Mission and the city of San Antonio and is still used as an active movie set.<ref name=todish188/>  

As the 150th anniversary of the battle approached in the 1980s, several additional movies were made about the Alamo, including the made-for-television movie ''[[The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory]]'', which [[Albert Nofi|Nofi]] regards as the most historically accurate of all Alamo films.<ref name=nofi213/> The movie Todish calls "the best theatrical film ever made about the Alamo" was also filmed in the 1980s.<ref name=todish190>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 190.</ref> Filmed in IMAX format using historical reenactors instead of professional actors, ''Alamo ... The Price of Freedom'' is shown only in San Antonio, with several views per day at a theater near the Alamo.<ref name=todish190/>  It runs only 45&nbsp;minutes<ref name=todish190/> but has "an attention to detail and intensity that are remarkable".<ref name=todish191>Todish ''et al'' (1998), p. 191.</ref> In 2004 another film, also called ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]'', was released. Described by [[CNN]] as possibly "the most character-driven of all the movies made on the subject", the movie starred [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Crockett, [[Dennis Quaid]] as Sam Houston, and [[Jason Patric]] as Bowie.<ref>{{citation|last=Culpepper|first=Andy|title=A different take on 'The Alamo'|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/08/the.alamo/|date=April 8, 2004|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>
