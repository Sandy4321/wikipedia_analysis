'''Tamburica''' ({{pron-en|t<U+00E6>m<U+02C8>b<U+028A><U+0259>r<U+026A>ts<U+0259>}} or {{IPAlink-en|<U+02CC>t<U+00E6>mb<U+0259><U+02C8>r<U+026A>ts<U+0259>}}; {{lang-hr|Tamburica}} and {{lang-sr|''<U+0422><U+0430><U+043C><U+0431><U+0443><U+0440><U+0438><U+0446><U+0430>''}} {{pron|<U+02C8>tamburitsa}}, {{lang-hu|Tambura}}, meaning ''Little Tamboura''), refers to any member of a family of long-necked lutes popular in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]], particularly [[Croatia]] (especially [[Slavonia]]), northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]) and [[Hungary]]. It is also known in parts of southern [[Slovenia]] and eastern [[Austria]]. All took their name and some characteristics from the [[Persia]]n [[tanbur]] but also resemble the [[mandolin]], in that its strings are [[pizzicato|plucked]] and often paired. The frets may be moveable to allow the playing of various [[mode]]s. The body of the instrument is made of a hollow gourd.

==History==
[[File:Incidence area of CE tambura.png|thumb|left|220px|The area where tamburica is played.]]
There is little reliable data showing how the tamboura entered [[Central Europe]]. It was probably brought by the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to [[Bosnia]], from where the instrument spread further with migrations of [[<U+0160>okci]] and [[Bunjevci]] above the [[Sava River]] to all parts of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and further.<ref>[http://www.tresnjevka.net/engtamb.htm Over tamburica - short history]</ref> The modern tamboura shape was developed in [[Hungary]] ([[Budapest]]) in the 20. century.

Until the Great Migration of the Serbs at the end of the 17th century, the type of tamboura most frequently used in Croatia and Serbia had a long neck and two or three strings (sometimes doubled). Similar string instruments are the Czech bratsche, Turkish [[saz]] and the [[sargija]], [[<U+00E7>iftelia]] and [[bouzouki]]. 

In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], and [[Serbia]] (especially the [[Pannonian plain]], [[Slavonia]], [[Vojvodina]] and [[Hungary]] the tamboura (often referred to by the [[diminutive]] ''tamburica'') is the basic instrument of traditional [[folk music]], usually performed by small [[orchestras]] of three to ten members, though large orchestras capable of playing even [[Western classical music|classical]] pieces arranged for tamboura also exist.

==Types of Tamburica==
The number of strings on a tamburica varies and it may have single or double-coursed strings or a mixture of both. Double-coursed strings are tuned in [[unison]]. The basic forms of tamburica are 

*The ''[[samica]]'' (three double strings). 
*The ''prim'' (one double string, ''G'', and three single strings''E'', ''A'', ''D''). This is the smallest tamburica (about 50&nbsp;cm long) but it is very loud. It is mostly used as a [[lead instrument]] or harmonising instrument. The ''bisernica'' (from "biser" meaning "pearl") is almost identical but may have two double strings and two single strings. 
*The ''bas-prim'' or ''bra<U+010D>'' (two double strings and two single strings), a slightly bigger, lower instrument than the bisernica but played in a similar fashion. 
*The ''<U+010D>elovi<U+0107>'' (two double strings and two single strings). 
*The ''bugarija'' or ''kontra'' (one double string ''D'' and three single strings}, similar to a [[guitar]], mostly used for. A  bugarija has five strings, the bottom pair are ''D'', the middle string is ''A'' and the top two are tuned ''F#'' and ''F#''.
*The ''<U+010D>elo'' (four strings), similar in size to the bugarija and used for [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]].
*The ''bas'' or ''berda'' (four strings), can only be played standing and is used for playing bass lines.

There is a view that the first tambura orchestra was formed in [[Hungary]] in the 19th century.<ref name="Volly">Volly Istv<U+00E1>n: Bajai tambur<U+00E1>sok - A bajai tamburazenekar t<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>nete (1964.)</ref> The instruments' names came from the Hungarian names of the musical instruments of the symphony orchestra - originally from the Hungarian Gipsy bands (''b<U+0151>g<U+0151>s'' - bege<U+0161>, ''pr<U+00ED>m'', ''kontra'').<ref name="Volly"/><ref>Magyar N<U+00E9>prajzi Lexikon,  Akad<U+00E9>miai Kiad<U+00F3>, Budapest 1977-1982</ref> These orchestras soon spread to what is now [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Austria]], [[Slovenia]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]].

==Parts of tamburica==
The tamburica is made in three parts; body, neck and head. The body ([[Sound box]]) was pear-shaped until the middle of the nineteenth century CE, and was built by scooping out the log. Today they are mostly are built in the way of the guitar and even the smallest, the Bisernica, has a constructed box. The fingerboard has frets(pre<U+010D>nice, krsnice, pragovi). The head (<U+010D>iviji<U+0161>te) usually had a sharpened form, which can be found still on some bisernicas, but the "snail" design later got the supremacy.<ref>[http://www.tresnjevka.net/engtamb.htm Over the Tamburica <U+2013> in general]</ref>

==Composers and ensembles==
Tamburica [[orchestra]]s can have various formats from a trio to a large orchestra. A basic trio consists of a ''prim'', a ''kontra'' and a ''<U+010D>elo''. Larger orchestras also have ''bas-prims'' and ''bass-prim-terc'' tamburas. 

The first major composer for the tamburica was [[Pajo Kolari<U+0107>]], who formed the first amateur tamburica orchestra in [[Osijek]] in 1847.{{Fact|date=August 2008}}. Kolari<U+0107>'s student Mijo Majer formed the first tamburica choir led by a [[conducting|conductor]], the "Hrvatska [[lyre|Lira]]", in 1882. 

Croatian composers for the tamburica include Franjo Ksaver Kuha<U+010D>, Sini<U+0161>a Leopold and Julije Njiko<U+0161>.  The instrument is associated with [[Croats|Croatian]] [[nationalism]]. [[Vinko <U+017D>ganec]], an associate of [[B<U+00E9>la Bart<U+00F3>k]], collected more than 19,000 Croatian folk songs.

The Grand Tamburica Orchestra of [[Radio Novi Sad]] was founded in 1951 under the leadership of Sava Vukosavljev, who composed and arranged many pieces for tamburica orchestra and published a comprehensive book; <U+201C>Vojvo<U+0111>anska tambura<U+201D> ("The [[Tambura]] of Vojvodina"). There are also orchestras of [[Radio Belgrade]] and Radio [[Podgorica]], Radio [[Kikinda]] etc. [[Janika Bal<U+00E1>zs]], a member of the Radio Novi Sad orchestra who also had his own octet, was a popular performer whose name became synonymous with the tamburica. Famous Tamburica orchestras of Serbia include those of Maksa Popov and Aleksandar Aranicki.
