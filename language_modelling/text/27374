'''March fracture''', also known as '''fatigue fracture''' or '''stress fracture of metarsal bone''' is the [[fracture]] of distal third of one of the [[metatarsals]] occuring because of recurrent overstress.  It is more common in [[soldier]]s, but also occurs in hikers, and even those, like hospital nurses, whose duties entail much standing.  It mostly occurs in [[second metatarsal]] of the right foot.<ref>Hamilton Bailey's Demonstrations of Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery ISBN 0 7506 0625 8</ref> It is a common cause of foot pain, especially when people suddenly increase their acitivities.<ref>http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/lowerfx/g/march.htm</ref>

==Occurrence==
March fracture usually occurs in the shaft of second or less often in the [[third metatarsal bone]]; stress fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]] is a distinct fracture (the [[Jones fracture]]). In runners, march fracture occurs most often in the metatarsal neck, while in dancers it occurs in proximal shaft. In ballet dancers, fracture mostly occurs at the base of [[second metatarsal]] and at [[Lisfranc joint]]s. This fracture always occurs following a prolonged stress or weight bearing, and the history of direct trauma is very rare. Consideration should always be given to [[osteoporosis]] and [[osteomalacia]]. [[Cavus]] feet are risk factor to march fracture.<ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>

==Clinical features==
The onset is undramatic.  When the boot or [[shoes]] are taken off, there is a cramplike pain in the affected forefoot, and moderate local [[edema]] appears on the dorsal aspect.  On moving each toe in turn, that of the involved metatarsal causes pain, and when the bone is palpated from the [[dorsal]] surface, a point of [[tenderness]] is found directly over the lesion. [[Radiography]] at this stage is negative, but the condition is diagnosed correctly by military [[surgeon]]s without the aid of [[x-ray]]s. In civil life, it is seldom diagnosed correctly for a week or two, when, because of lack of immobilization, there is an excessive deposit of [[callus]] (which may be palpable) around the fracture.

==Diagnostic studies==
[[X-ray]] is seldom helpful, but a [[CT scan]] and an [[MRI]] study may help in diagnosis.<ref>Emergency Orthopedics:  The Extremities By Robert Rutha Simon and Steven Koenigsknecht ISBN 0838522106</ref>
Bone scan are positive in early. [[Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] is aslo helpful to rule out the comorbid osteoporosis. <ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>

==Differential diagnosis==
*Acute metarsal fracture.
*[[Hallux rigidus]].
*[[Jones fracture]].
*[[Sesamoid]] stress fracture.
*Acute sesamoid fracture.
*Proximal fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture.<ref>http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/85746-diagnosis</ref>

==Treatment==
The first line treatment should be reduction of movements for 6 to 12 weeks. Wooden-soled shoes or a cast should be given for this purpose. In rare cases in which stress fracture occurs with a cavus foot, [[plantar fascia]] release may be appropriate. <ref>http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx</ref>
