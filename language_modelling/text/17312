'''BAE Systems plc (BAE)''' is a British [[defence contractor|defence]] and aerospace company headquartered at [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], England, which has worldwide interests, particularly in North America through its subsidiary [[BAE Systems Inc]]. BAE is the world's third largest defence contractor and the largest in Europe.<ref name="top100">{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/index.php?S=07top100 |title=Defense News Top 100 |accessdate=2007-07-31 |publisher=www.DefenseNews.com}}</ref> BAE was formed on [[30 November]] [[1999]] by the <U+00A3>7.7&nbsp;billion merger of two British companies: Marconi Electronic Systems (MES), the defence electronics and naval shipbuilding subsidiary of [[The General Electric Company plc]] (GEC) and aircraft, munitions and naval systems manufacturer British Aerospace (BAe). 

BAE is the successor to many iconic aircraft and defence electronics companies, including [[Marconi Company|The Marconi Company]], the first commercial company devoted to the development and use of radio; [[Avro|A.V. Roe and Company]], one of the world's first aircraft companies; [[de Havilland]], manufacturer of the world's [[de Havilland Comet|first]] commercial jet airliner; [[British Aircraft Corporation]], co-manufacturer of the [[Concorde]] supersonic transport; and [[Supermarine]], the manufacturer of the renowned [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]. It has increasingly disengaged from its businesses in continental Europe in favour of investing in the United States. Since its formation it has sold its shares of [[Airbus]], [[EADS Astrium]], [[Alenia Marconi Systems|AMS]] and [[Atlas Elektronik]].

BAE Systems is involved in several major defence projects, including the [[F-35 Lightning II]], the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] and the [[Royal Navy]] [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier|''Queen Elizabeth'' class]] aircraft carriers. The company has been the subject of criticism, both general opposition to the arms trade and also specific allegations of unethical and corrupt practices, including the [[Al Yamamah]] contracts with [[Saudi Arabia]] that have earned BAE and its predecessor <U+00A3>43&nbsp;billion in twenty years.<ref>{{cite news |last =O'Connell| first =Dominic |title =BAE cashes in on <U+00A3>40bn Arab jet deal |work=The Sunday Times| publisher = News International | date = 2006-08-20| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2095-2320097,00.html| accessdate =2006-08-22}}</ref>

[[Image:BAE Systems Land evolution.png|thumb|250px|Evolution of the land systems division of BAE Systems, 1970s to [[BAE Systems Land and Armaments|Land & Armaments]] formation]]

BAE Systems was formed on [[30 November]] [[1999]] by the <U+00A3>7.7&nbsp;billion merger of [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) and [[Marconi Electronic Systems]] (MES).<ref name="scotsman2000">{{cite news |first=Andrew|last=Turpin| title = BAE Eyes US Targets After Profit Rockets |work= The Scotsman| publisher =The Scotsman Publications|page=26| date =2000-03-04| accessdate = 2007-09-07}}</ref> As a result, BAE Systems is the successor to many of the most famous British aircraft, defence electronics and warship manufacturers. Predecessor companies built the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]], the world's first commercial jet airliner; the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]] "jump jet", the world's first operational [[V/STOL|Vertical/Short Take-Off and Landing]] aircraft; the "groundbreaking"<ref>{{cite news|first=James|last=Dow|title=Edinburgh's first line of defence |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/business.cfm?id=840772004|work=The Scotsman|date=2004-07-23|accessdate=2007-09-26 }}</ref> Blue Vixen radar carried by [[BAE Sea Harrier#FA2|Sea Harrier FA2]]s and which formed the basis of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Eurofighter's]] [[Euroradar CAPTOR|CAPTOR]] radar; and co-produced the iconic [[Concorde]] supersonic airliner with [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]].

British Aerospace was a civil and [[military aircraft]] manufacturer, as well as a provider of military land systems. The company had emerged from the massive consolidation of UK aircraft manufacturers since World War II. British Aerospace was formed on [[29 April]] [[1977]] by the nationalisation and merger of The [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), the [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Group]] and [[Scottish Aviation]].<ref name="compcomm"/> Both BAC and Hawker Siddeley were themselves the result of various mergers and acquisitions.<ref name="lineage">{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/storage/lineage/?t=lineage |title=The BAE Systems Lineage|accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=BAE Systems Heritage|publisher=BAE Systems plc}}</ref> 

Marconi Electronic Systems was the defence subsidiary of British engineering firm [[The General Electric Company]] (GEC), dealing largely in military [[system integrator|systems integration]], as well as naval and land systems. Marconi's heritage dates back to [[Guglielmo Marconi|Guglielmo Marconi's]] [[Marconi Company|Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company]], founded in 1897.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://production.investis.com/heritage/nonflash/timeline/1874_guglielmo_marconi/ |title=1874 Guglielmo Marconi |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=BAE Systems Heritage|publisher=BAE Systems plc}}</ref> GEC purchased [[English Electric]] (which included [[Marconi Company|Marconi]]) in 1968 and thereafter used the Marconi brand for its defence businesses (as GEC-Marconi and later Marconi Electronic Systems). GEC's own defence heritage dates back to World War I, when its contribution to the war effort included radios and bulbs. World War II consolidated this position, as the company was involved in important technological advances, notably the [[cavity magnetron]] for [[radar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.connected-earth.com/Galleries/Prideofownership/Economicfactors/Anewindustry/index.htm |title=A new industry |accessdate=2007-09-12|work=www.connected-earth.com|quote=during the Second World War it developed the cavity magnetron for radar}}</ref> Between 1945 and 1999, GEC-Marconi/Marconi Electronic Systems became one of the world's most important [[defence contractor]]s.

===Formation===
The 1997 merger of American corporations [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]], which followed the forming of [[Lockheed Martin]], the world's largest defence contractor in 1995, increased the pressure on European defence companies to consolidate. In June 1997 British Aerospace Defence Managing Director [[John Weston (businessman)|John Weston]] commented "Europe... is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the U.S.".<ref>{{cite news |first=Andrea|last=Rothman|coauthors=Landberg, Reed |title=Europe Defense Firms Feel Pressure to Unite|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2544541&date=19970615&query=Pressure+to+Unite  |work=The Seattle Times|date=1997-06-15|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> European governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity, a European Aerospace and Defence Company.<ref>{{cite news|title=Business: The Company File: Defence merger on the radar |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/130305.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=1998-07-10 |accessdate=2007-09-15 }} </ref>

As early as 1995 British Aerospace and the German aerospace and defence company [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace]] (DASA) were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company.<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Jones|title=Europe cries foul as New BAe emerges |work=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |date=1999-01-20 |accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> The two companies envisaged including A<U+00E9>rospatiale, the other major European aerospace company, but only after its privatisation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|coauthors=Morrocco, John D. |title=French Government Grapples With Aerospace Strategy |work=Aviation Week and Space Technology |publisher= The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=1997-06-30|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> The first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of [[Airbus]] from a consortium of British Aerospace, DASA, A<U+00E9>rospatiale and [[Construcciones Aeron<U+00E1>uticas|Construcciones Aeron<U+00E1>uticas SA]] into an integrated company; in this aim BAe and DASA were united against the various objections of A<U+00E9>rospatiale.<ref name="BAeDASArelations">{{cite news |first=Bernard|last=Gray|coauthors=Skapinker, Michael|title=Giant waiting in the wings: Bernard Gray and Michael Skapinker ask if Europe's defence industry can consolidate in time to challenge US dominance|work=Financial Times|date=1997-06-24|accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> As well as Airbus, British Aerospace and DASA were partners in the [[Panavia Tornado]] and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft projects. Merger discussions began between British Aerospace and DASA in July 1998, just as French participation became more likely with the announcement that A<U+00E9>rospatiale was to merge with [[Matra]] and emerge with a diluted French government shareholding.<ref>{{cite news|title=BAe and Dasa discuss proposals for merger:

Meanwhile GEC was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation. Reporting the appointment of [[George Simpson, Baron Simpson of Dunkeld|George Simpson]] as GEC managing director in 1996, ''The Independent'' had said "some analysts believe that Mr Simpson's inside knowledge of BAe, a long-rumoured GEC bid target, was a key to his appointment. GEC favours forging a national 'champion' defence group with BAe to compete with the giant US organisations."<ref>{{cite news |first=Russell|last=Hotten |title=GEC confirms Simpson job|work=The Independent |publisher=Newspaper Pub |page=17|date=1996-03-19 |accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref> When GEC put MES up for sale on [[22 December]] [[1998]], BAE abandoned the DASA merger in favour of purchasing its British rival. The merger of British Aerospace and MES was announced on [[19 January]] [[1999]].<ref>BAE Systems Annual Report 1999 22. BAE Systems plc (2000). Retrieved on [[2006-10-27]].</ref> Evans stated that in 2004 that his fear was that an American defence contractor would acquire MES and challenge both British Aerospace and DASA.<ref name="ftBAeDASA"/> The merger created a [[vertically integrated]] company which ''The Scotsman'' described as "[a combination of British Aerospace's] contracting and platform-building skills with Marconi's coveted electronics systems capability".<ref>{{cite news |first=Louise|last=Nevill|title=BAe and Marconi moving toward merger|work=The Scotsman |publisher=The Scotsman Publications|page=17|date=1999-01-04|accessdate=2007-09-21}}</ref> for example combining the manufacturer of the Eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircraft's electronic systems; British Aerospace was MES' largest customer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Speculation Rises on GEC Merger |work=The Scotsman |publisher=The Scotsman Publications  |date=1998-12-28 |accessdate=2007-09-17}} </ref> In contrast, DASA's response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with A<U+00E9>rospatiale to create the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company ([[EADS]]), a [[horizontal integration]]. EADS has since considered a merger with [[Thales Group|Thales]] to create a "fully rounded" company.<ref name="integrated"/>

Seventeen undertakings were given by BAE Systems to the [[Department of Trade and Industry]] which prevented a reference of the merger to the [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]]. These were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender sub-contracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries. Another condition was the "[[Chinese wall|firewall]]ing" of former British Aerospace and MES teams on defence projects such as the [[Joint Strike Fighter Program|Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF). In 2007 the government, on advice from the [[Office of Fair Trading]], announced it had agreed to release BAE from ten of the undertakings due to "a change in circumstances".<ref>{{cite news|title= U.K. Releases BAE SYSTEMS From Undertakings For Marconi Electronic Merger|work= Defense Daily International|publisher= |date= 2007-02-09|accessdate= 2007-03-02}}</ref>

BAE Systems inherited the "special" shareholding that was established when British Aerospace was privatised. This special share, with a nominal value of <U+00A3>1, is held on behalf of the [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]. This shareholding prevents amendments of certain parts of the company's [[Articles of Association (law)|Articles of Association]] without the permission of the Secretary of State.<ref name="compcomm">{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1991/fulltext/296c2.pdf |title=BAe and Thomson-CSF SA: A report on the proposed merger |accessdate=2005-12-08 |date=1991-02-06 |publisher=[[Competition Commission]]}}</ref> These Articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than 15% of the company's shares or control the majority of the board and that the CEO and the Chairman of BAE Systems must be British nationals.

===Expansion and restructuring===
BAE Systems' first annual report identified Airbus, support services to militaries and integrated systems for air, land and naval applications as key areas of growth. It also stated the company's desire to both expand in the US and participate in further consolidation in Europe. BAE described 2001 as an "important year" for its European joint ventures, which were reorganised considerably. BAE has described the rationale for expansion in the US; "[it] is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the Western European nations combined. Importantly, US investment in research and development is significantly higher than in Western Europe."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://production.investis.com/investors/news/rp/rp2001/ar00/ar00.pdf|title=BAE Systems 2000 Annual Report |accessdate=2007-10-05|format=PDF |publisher=BAE Systems |pages=6}}</ref> When [[Dick Olver]] was appointed Chairman in July 2004 he ordered a review of the company's businesses which ruled out further European acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a "strategic bias" for expansion and investment in the US.<ref>{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=Oil or missiles, the constant is power|work=Financial Times|date=2004-12-07|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> The review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and, with two acquisitions in 2004 and 2005, BAE moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world. This shift in strategy was described as "remarkable" by the ''Financial Times''.<ref name="baelandshift">{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Spiegel|title=BAE prepares for increase land war spend|work=Financial Times|date=2005-06-25|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref>

In 2000 [[Matra Marconi Space]], a joint BAE/Matra company, was merged with the space division of DASA to form [[Astrium]]. On [[16 June]] [[2003]] BAE sold its 25% share to EADS for <U+00A3>84&nbsp;million, however due to the lossmaking status of the company BAE invested an equal amount for "restructuring".<ref>{{cite news| first = Mark| last = Odell| title = BAE agrees new deal for Astrium |work = Financial Times| page =15 | date = 2003-02-01 | accessdate = 2007-01-23}}</ref> In January 2001 Airbus Industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company.<ref>{{cite press release |title=EADS and BAE SYSTEMS complete Airbus integration - Airbus SAS formally established |publisher=BAE Systems plc|date=2001-07-12 |url=http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_120720011.html |accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref><ref name="awst formation">{{cite news|first=Pierre|last=Sparaco|title=Climate Conducive For Airbus Consolidation |work=Aviation Week & Space Technology |date=2001-03-19 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> In November 2001, BAE announced the closure of the Avro Regional Jet ([[BAe 146|Avro RJ]]) production line at [[Woodford, Cheshire|Woodford]] and the cancellation of the Avro RJX, an advanced series of the aircraft family, as the business was "no longer viable".<ref>{{cite press release |title=BAE SYSTEMS closes the RJX Programme |publisher=BAE Systems plc |date=2001-11-27 |url=http://www.baesystems.com/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2001/press_27112001.html|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> The final Avro RJ to be completed became the last British civil airliner. In December 2001 BAE's share of [[Matra BAe Dynamics]] and the missile division of [[Alenia Marconi Systems]] (AMS) were merged into [[MBDA]], which thus became the world's second largest missile manufacturer.<ref>{{cite news|title=EADS, BAE and Finmeccanica Complete MBDA Merger|work=Defense Daily International |publisher= |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2007-10-04|quote=the new MBDA, the world's second largest missile manufacturer behind Raytheon}}</ref> Although EADS has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of MBDA, BAE has said that, unlike Airbus, MBDA is a "core business".<ref>{{cite news |title ="MBDA prepares for consolidation" | work =Financial Times|date =2006-03-16 |accessdate =2006-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Barrie|coauthors=Wall, Robert; Sparaco, Pierre |title=High-Stakes Gamble; BAE Systems bets future on defense, using its Airbus share as ante|work=Aviation Week & Space Technology|date=2006-04-17|accessdate=2007-10-04 }} </ref>

In June 2002, BAE confirmed it was in takeover discussions with [[TRW]], an American aerospace, automotive and defence business. This was prompted by [[Northrop Grumman]]'s <U+00A3>4.1&nbsp;billion (approx. US$6&nbsp;billion c. 2002) hostile bid for TRW in February 2002. A bidding war between BAE, Northrop and [[General Dynamics]] ended on [[2002-06-01]] when Northrop's increased bid of <U+00A3>5.1&nbsp;billion was accepted. On [[11 December]] [[2002]], BAE issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the [[Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod MR4]] maritime reconnaissance/attack aircraft and the [[Astute class submarine|Astute SSN]] projects.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark|last=Odell |title=BAE warning sends share price to 7-year low: News of 'additional issues' on two big defence contracts takes market by surprise|work=Financial Times |date=2002-12-12|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> On [[2003-02-19]] BAE Systems took a charge of <U+00A3>750&nbsp;million against these projects and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) agreed to pay a further <U+00A3>700&nbsp;million of the cost.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark|last=Odell|title=Whitehall re-draws key BAE defence contracts|work=Financial Times |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> In 2000 the company had taken a <U+00A3>300&nbsp;million "loss charge" on the Nimrod contract which was expected to cover "all the costs of completion of the current contract".<ref>{{cite news | first = Kevin | last = Done | title = Nimrod refit turns into nightmare | work = Financial Times | page = 24 | date = 2002-12-13 | accessdate = 2007-01-06}}</ref>

In July 2003 BAE Systems and [[Finmeccanica]] announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies, to be collectively known as [[Eurosystems]]. These companies would have pooled the avionics, [[C4ISTAR]] and communications businesses of the two companies.<ref>{{cite news |title=BAE ties up <U+00A3>2.6bn Italian deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3043328.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=2003-06-03 |accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> However the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way lead to a re-evaluation of the proposal, BAE's 2004 Annual Report states that "recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed Eurosystems transaction with Finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model". The main part of this deal was the dissolution of AMS and the establishment of [[SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems]]. In late March 2007 BAE Systems sold its 25% share of SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems to Finmeccanica for <U+20AC>400&nbsp;million (approx. <U+00A3>270&nbsp;million c. 2007).<ref>{{cite news |first=Patricia J.|last=Parmalee|title=Selex Sale Sealed |work=Aviation Week & Space Technology |publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies |date=2007-04-09 |accessdate=2007-08-13}}</ref>

In December 2005, BAE announced the sale of its German naval systems subsidiary, [[Atlas Elektronik]], to [[ThyssenKrupp]] and EADS. The sale was complicated by the requirement of the German government to approve any sale.

===Airbus shareholding===
{{main|Airbus}}
BAE Systems inherited British Aerospace's share of Airbus Industrie, which consisted of two factories at [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] and [[Filton]]. These facilities manufactured wings for the Airbus family of aircraft. In 2001 Airbus was incorporated as [[Airbus|Airbus SAS]], a [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> par actions simplifi<U+00E9>e|joint stock company]]. In return for a 20% share in the new company BAE Systems transferred ownership of its Airbus plants (known as [[Airbus UK]]) to the new company. 

Despite repeated suggestions as early as 2000 that BAE wished to sell its 20% share of Airbus, the possibility was consistently denied by the company.<ref name="scotsman2000"/><ref>{{cite news |first=Peter|last=Spiegel|title=BAE denies Airbus sale plans|work=Financial Times|date=2005-09-07|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> However on [[6 April]] [[2006]] BBC News reported that it was indeed to sell its stake, then "conservatively valued" at <U+00A3>2.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name="BBC Airbus">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4886154.stm | title =BAE confirms possible Airbus sale | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-04-07 | accessdate =2006-08-12}}</ref> Due to the slow pace of informal negotiations, BAE exercised its [[put option]] which saw investment bank [[N M Rothschild & Sons|Rothschild]] appointed to give an independent valuation. Six days after this process began, Airbus announced delays to the [[Airbus A380|A380]] with significant effects on the value of Airbus shares. On [[2 June]] [[2006]] Rothschild valued BAE's share at <U+00A3>1.87&nbsp;billion, well below BAE's, analysts' and even EADS' expectations.<ref>{{cite news | first =David | last =Gow | url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,1811589,00.html | title =BAE under pressure to hold Airbus stake | work =The Guardian | publisher =Guardian Newspapers |date =2006-07-03 | accessdate =2006-07-03}}</ref> The BAE board recommended that the company proceed with the sale.

==Areas of business==
BAE Systems defines its "home markets" to be Australia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Sweden, the UK and US.<ref name="about"/>

===UK===
BAE Systems is the predominant supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence, being the only company to receive more than <U+00A3>1&nbsp;billion from the MOD in 2004/2005.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F530ED6C-F80C-4F24-8438-0B587CC4BF4D/0/def_industrial_strategy_wp_cm6697.pdf|title = Defence Industrial Strategy: Defence White Paper|accessdate = 2006-09-11| date = December 2005| format = PDF| publisher = Ministry of Defence| pages = 30}}</ref> Oxford Economic Forecasting states that in 2002 BAE's UK businesses employed 111,578 people, achieved export sales of <U+00A3>3&nbsp;billion and paid <U+00A3>2.6&nbsp;billion in taxes.

Since its creation BAE Systems had a difficult relationship with the MOD. This was attributed to deficient project management by the company, but also in part to the deficiencies in the terms of "fixed price contracts". BAE [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Michael Turner (businessman)|Mike Turner]] said in 2006 "We had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldn't have taken".<ref>{{cite news | first =Angela | last = Jameson | title = BAE Systems chief reaps reward for years of fighting for revival | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,630-2059728,00.html | work = The Times | publisher = Times Newspapers| date = 2006-02-27 | accessdate =2006-11-09 }}</ref> These competition rules were introduced by [[Peter Levene, Baron Levene of Portsoken|Lord Levene]] during the 1980s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to "cost plus contracts" where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit.<ref name="basic">{{cite web | url = http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Papers/BP50.pdf | title = The UK Defence Industrial Strategy and Alternative Approaches| accessdate = 2006-11-09| author = Dr Steven Schofield| date = March 2006| format = PDF| work = Basic Papers: Occasional Papers on International Security Policy| pages =5}}</ref> 

BAE was operating in "the only truly open defence market",<ref>{{cite news | first = Graham | last = Warwick | title = Best of British; For years BAE Systems' identity was British, but with its investment in foreign markets increasing, change is just around the corner | work = Flight International | publisher = Reed Elsevier Inc. | page = 48 | date = 2004-06-06| accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref> which meant that it was competing with US and European companies for British defence projects, while they were protected in their home markets. The US defence market is competitive, however largely between American firms, while foreign companies are excluded. In December 2005 the MOD published the Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) which has been widely acknowledged to recognise BAE as the UK's "national champion".<ref name="econdis">{{cite news | title = BAE Systems: Changing places | url = http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8091318 | work = The Economist | publisher = The Economist Newspaper| date = 2006-10-26 | accessdate = 2006-11-09}}</ref> The DIS identifies key industrial capabilities which must be maintained within the UK through long-term government commitments to support research spending and procurement. Of these capabilities, several are dominated by BAE, including naval vessels and submarines, armoured fighting vehicles, fixed wing aircraft, general munitions (with the exception of certain "niche capabilities abroad") and [[Network Enabled Capability]] (defined as C4ISTAR in the DIS).

After the publication of the DIS BAE Systems CEO Mike Turner said "If we didn't have the DIS and our profitability and the terms of trade had stayed as they were... then there had to be a question mark about our future in the UK".<ref>{{cite news | first = Douglas  | last = Barrie  | title = British Defense Industrial Strategy Secures BAE Systems as UK.

===United States===
{{main|BAE Systems Inc.}}
The attraction of MES to British Aerospace was largely its ownership of Tracor, a major American defence contractor.<ref name="integrated">{{cite news|title=Getting it together? |work=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper  |date=2002-07-20 |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref> Since its creation the company has steadily increased its investment in and revenues from the US. Major European companies such as Thales and EADS have yet to be awarded, for example, a position relative to BAE Systems' involvement in the F-35 Lightning II programme.

BAE Systems faces less impediments in this sense than its European counterparts, as there is a high [[special relationship|degree of integration]] between the US and UK defence establishments. BAE's purchase of [[Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems]] in November 2000 was described by [[John Hamre]], CEO of the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] and former [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], as "precedent setting" given the advanced and classified nature of many of that company's products.<ref>{{cite news |first=Greg|last=Schneider|title=Arms Across the Atlantic; A Yank Leads the Former British Aerospace To the Top Tier of U.S. Defense Contractors|work=The Washington Post |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2007-09-14}}</ref>

==Corporate governance==
As of mid-2007 the members of the [[board of directors]] of BAE Systems are Dick Olver (Chairman),  Mike Turner (CEO), [[Philip J.

The previous CEO, John Weston, was forced to resign in 2002 in a boardroom "coup" and was replaced by Mike Turner.<ref>{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Wachman | title = A very British coup at BAE | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,676379,00.html | work = The Observer | publisher = Guardian Newspapers| date = 2002-03-21 | accessdate = 2006-10-27}}</ref> ''The Business'' reported that Weston was ousted when non-executive directors informed the Chairman that they had lost confidence in him. Further, it was suggested that at least one non-executive director was encouraged to make such a move by the MOD due to the increasingly fractious relationship between BAE and the government.<ref name="Business">{{cite news|first=Ian|last= Watson|title=Weston is blown away in shoot out at Dukes Hotel|work=The Business|publisher=Sunday Business Group|page=10|date=2002-04-07 | accessdate = 2007-01-25}}</ref> As well as the terms of the Nimrod contract, Weston had fought against the MOD's insistence that one of the first three Type 45 destroyers should be built by VT Group.

It is understood that Turner has a poor working relationship with senior MOD officials, (for example with former Defence Secretary [[Geoff Hoon]]). Significantly the first meeting between Olver and Hoon was said to have gone well, a MOD official commented "He is a man we can do business with. We think it is good to be taking a fresh look at things."<ref>{{cite news | first =Oliver | last =Morgan | url =http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1253225,00.html | title =BAE's Olver demands 'root and branch' change | work =The Guardian | publisher =Guardian Newspapers | date =2005-07-04 | accessdate =2005-12-08}}</ref> Reports in 2005 suggested that relations between Olver and Turner were strained. In June 2005 Turner heightened concerns of boardroom tensions by criticising Olver's knowledge of the defence industry, "[he] has a low knowledge base and knows nothing about our industry". Turner did suggest however that Olver was on a learning curve, "He'll fully understand it [in 5 years]. This is a business that takes time to understand. It's not just business, it's political."<ref>{{cite news | first =Christopher | last =Hope | url =http://www.money.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2005/06/14/cnbae14.xml&menuId=242&sSheet=/money/2005/06/14/ixfrontcity.html | title =BAE chief admits clashing with chairman over Europe | work =Daily Telegraph | date =2005-06-14 | accessdate =2005-12-05}}</ref>

Of all the company's activities, the most profitable are the Al Yamamah contracts to supply and support the Royal Saudi Air Force. This deal has contributed substantially to BAE's profits; it was 42% in 2003,<ref>{{cite news | first =Peter | last =Spiegel | title =Negative ratings watch for BAE |page = 23 | work =Financial Times| date =2004-11-19 | accessdate =2005-02-15}}</ref> however in 2005 it was less than 18% (see graph).

==Criticisms==
[[Image:HMS Coventry F98.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[HMS Coventry]]'' was one of two frigates sold to Romania. The terms of the sale have been controversial.]] 
Like many arms manufacturers, BAE has received criticism from various human rights and anti-arms trade organisations due to the human rights records of governments to which it has sold equipment. These include Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Zimbabwe, and Israel. BAE's US subsidiary makes several subsystems for [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]]s, 236 of which have been supplied to the [[Israel Defense Forces]].<ref>{{cite news | first = Shawan| last = Jabarin | title = Stop Arming Israel | url = http://www.caat.org.uk/caatnews/CAATnews198.pdf | format = PDF | work = CAAT News | publisher = Campaign Against Arms Trade| pages = 8<U+2013>9 | date = Oct/Nov 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-02}}</ref> In September 2003 ''The Sunday Times'' reported that BAE had hired a private security contractor to collate information about individuals working at the Campaign Against Arms Trade and their activities.<ref>{{cite news | title = How the woman at No 27 ran spy network for an arms firm | work = Sunday Times | publisher = Times Newspapers | page = 10 | date = 2003-09-28| accessdate = 2006-11-28}}</ref>

BAE has been subject to allegations of corruption.<ref name="solicitorgeneral">{{cite news|title= BAE in several corruption probes|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6339625.stm|work=|publisher= BBC|date= 2007-02-07|accessdate= 2007-02-15}}</ref> On [[7 February]] 2007 the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Mike O'Brien (UK politician)|Mike O'Brien]] announced that BAE contracts in six countries were being investigated by the [[Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) for "suspected international corruption"; [[Chile]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Qatar]], [[Romania]], South Africa and [[Tanzania]]. In September 2005 ''The Guardian'' alleged that banking records showed that BAE paid <U+00A3>1&nbsp;million to [[Augusto Pinochet]], the former Chilean dictator.<ref name="Pinochet">{{cite news | first = David | last = Leigh | coauthors = Evans, Rob | title = Revealed: BAE's secret <U+00A3>1m to Pinochet | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/chile/story/0,13755,1570335,00.html |work =[[The Guardian]] | publisher =Guardian Newspapers| date =2005-09-15 | accessdate =2006-10-27}}</ref>''The Guardian'' has also reported that "clandestine arms deals" have been under investigation in Chile and the UK since 2003 and that British Aerospace and BAE made a number of payments to Pinochet advisers.<ref>{{cite news|first =Jonathan | last =Franklin | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/chile/story/0,,1818423,00.html |title =Pinochet and son deny selling cocaine to Europe and US |work =The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Newspapers|date =2006-07-12|accessdate =2006-08-14}}</ref>

The SFO's Czech Republic investigation relates to alleged bribery as part of the deal to lease BAE/Saab Gripen fighters to that country.<ref>{{cite news| title = FAQ: The investigation| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0,,1959514,00.html| work = The Guardian| publisher = Guardian Newspapers| date = 2006-11-29| accessdate = 2007-11-16}}</ref> BAE has been criticised for its role in disposing of surplus Royal Navy warships. [[HMS Sheffield (F96)|HMS ''Sheffield'']] was sold to the Chilean Navy in 2003 for <U+00A3>27&nbsp;million, however the government's profit from the sale was <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million after contracts worth <U+00A3>24&nbsp;million were placed with BAE for upgrade and refurbishment of the ship. BAE is alleged to have paid "secret offshore commissions" of over <U+00A3>7&nbsp;million to secure the sale of [[HMS London (F95)|HMS ''London'']] and [[HMS Coventry (F98)|HMS ''Coventry'']] to the Romanian Navy. BAE received a <U+00A3>116&nbsp;million contract for the refurbishment of the ships.<ref>{{cite news |first =David |last =Leigh |coauthors =Evans, Rob | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0,,1797639,00.html | title =Bribery inquiry may force <U+00A3>7m refund to Romania | work =The Guardian | publisher =Guardian Newspapers| date =2006-07-15 | accessdate =2006-08-14}}</ref>

In January 2007 BBC News highlighted concerns of arms campaigners regarding arms sales to South Africa, primarily in relation to the <U+00A3>2.3&nbsp;billion deal which saw BAE supply Hawk trainers and Gripen fighters.<ref>{{cite news | title = BAE South African deal 'probed'  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6255725.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2007-01-12 | accessdate = 2007-01-12}}</ref> The Tanzania inquiry relates to the sale of a radar system to that country in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Tanzania could seek radar refund |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6324169.stm|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= 2007-02-02|accessdate= 2007-02-19}}</ref> The sale was criticised by then [[Secretary of State for International Development]] [[Clare Short]], opposition MPs and the [[World Bank]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Tanzania radar sale 'waste of cash'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2044206.stm|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= 2002-06-14|accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref>

Responding to allegations of bribery and corruption, BAE Systems' 2006 Corporate Responsibility Report states "we continue to reject these allegations. ...We take our obligations under the law extremely seriously and will continue to comply with all legal requirements around the world."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baesystems.com/BAEProd/groups/public/documents/bae_publication/bae_pdf_cr_crreport06full.pdf |title=Corporate Responsibility Report 2006 |accessdate=2007-09-07 |format=PDF}}</ref>

===Nuclear weapons===
BAE has been criticised for its indirect engagement in production of [[nuclear weapons]]. Through its 37.5% share of MBDA it is involved with the production and support of the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Port<U+00E9>e|ASMP]] missile, an air launched nuclear missile which forms part of the [[Force de frappe|French nuclear deterrent]]. BAE is also the UK's only nuclear submarine manufacturer and thus produces a major element of the UK's nuclear deterrent. Due to this BAE was excluded from the portfolio of the government pension fund of Norway in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Exclusions from the Government Pension Fund - Global |publisher=Norway Ministry of Finance |date= |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/Press-Center/Press-releases/2006/Exclusions-from-the-Government-Pension-F.html?id=419804&epslanguage=EN-GB|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>

===Saudi Arabian contracts===

{{main|Al Yamamah}}
BAE (and British Aerospace previously) has long been the subject of allegations of bribery in relation to its business in Saudi Arabia. The UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) investigated the Al Yamamah contracts and has so far not published its conclusions, the only NAO report ever to be withheld.<ref>{{cite news | first = Gideon | last =Burrows|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/armstrade/story/0,,1014976,00.html|title =Out of arms way |work =The Guardian | publisher =Guardian Newspapers | date =2003-08-08| accessdate =2007-10-01}}</ref> The MOD has stated "The report remains sensitive.

However on [[14 December]] [[2006]] it was announced that the SFO was "discontinuing" its investigation into BAE. It stated that representations to its Director and the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] had lead to the conclusion that the wider public interest "to safeguard national and international security" outweighed any potential benefits of further investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title= Saudi defence deal probe ditched
