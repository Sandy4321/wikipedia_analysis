"'''New Tomorrow'''" is a 2011 [[English language]] song by [[Denmark|Danish]] pop/rock band [[A Friend in London]]. It represented [[Denmark]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]], held in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]], [[Germany]]. On 26 February 2011, the song won the Danish preselection contest  [[Dansk Melodi Grand Prix]] in [[Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]]. It is the first single from their yet-untitled debut album.

Immediately after, the single was released in Denmark, making it straight to #3 in its first week of release (chart dated 4 March 2011).

The song was used as the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]]'s anthem for the [[Maltese general election, 2013|2013 Malta elections]].

==Controversy==
"New Tomorrow" was written and composed by [[Lise Cabble]] and [[Jakob Gl<U+00E6>sner]]. However, even before it was chosen to represent Denmark in the Eurovision Song Contest, it was accused of plagiarising several different songs, e.g. "Herz an Herz" by German [[NDW]] band [[Paso Doble]], "[[Sing for Me (Andreas Johnson song)|Sing for Me]]" by Swedish singer-songwriter [[Andreas Johnson]], "Face 2 Face" by [[Future Trance United]], "[[Super Star (S.H.E album)|Super Star]]" by Taiwanese girl band [[S.H.E.]], "Silk Road" a Chinese folk tune interpreted by [[Kitaro]], "Yasashii Uta" by [[MUCC]], and "[[Shine (Take That song)|Shine]]" by [[Take That]].<ref name="eurovisionary">[http://www.eurovisionary.com/eurovision-news/heavy-plagiarism-accusations-towards-friend-london-s-entry ''Eurovisionary'': Heavy plagiarism accusations towards A Friend In London<U+2019>s entry ]</ref> 

One of the co-writers Jacob Gl<U+00E6>sner commented that "the song is very popular in its expression and consist basically only of five tones. It is unavoidable that it doesn<U+2019>t remind of a song one has already heard".<ref name="eurovisionary"/>

==Performance==
A Friend in London performed the song during [[Eurovision 2011]] finishing fifth overall with 134 points, including 12 points from Ireland, Iceland and the Netherlands and 10 points from Sweden and Estonia and 8 points from Slovenia.
