This is a '''list of particles''' in [[particle physics]], including currently known and hypothetical [[elementary particle]]s, as well as the '''composite''' particles that can be built up from them.
:''For a chronological listing of [[subatomic particle]]s by discovery date, see'' [[Timeline of particle discoveries]].

[[Image:Cloud chamber - visible trace of positron.JPG|right|320px|thumb|'''A new particle is discovered:''' The first detection of the [[positron]] occurred in 1932 in a [[cloud chamber]] built by [[Carl D. Anderson]].  The track of the positron can be seen, going from top to bottom and curving to the right.]]

==Elementary particles==
An [[elementary particle]] is a particle with no measurable internal structure, that is, it is not a composite of other particles. They are the fundamental objects of [[quantum field theory]]. Elementary particles can be classified according to their [[spin (physics)|spin]], with [[fermion]]s having half-integer spin and [[boson]]s integer spin.

===Standard Model===

The [[Standard Model]] of particle physics is our current understanding of the physics of elementary particles.  All Standard Model particles except the Higgs boson have been observed.

====Fermions (half-integer spin)====

[[Fermion]]s have half-integer spin; for all known elementary fermions this is <U+00BD>. Each fermion has its own distinct [[antiparticle]]. Fermions are the basic building blocks of all [[matter]]. They are classified according to whether they interact via the [[quantum chromodynamics|color force]] or not. According to the Standard Model, there are 12 flavors of elementary fermions: six [[quark]]s and six [[lepton]]s.
[[Image:Quark structure proton.svg|thumb|200px|Quark structure proton: 2 up quarks and 1 down quark.]]
* [[Quark]]s interact via the color force. Their respective [[antiparticles]] are known as antiquarks. Quarks exist in six [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]s:

* [[Lepton]]s do not interact via the color force. Their respective [[antiparticle]]s are known as antileptons (although the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is called the [[positron]] for historical reasons). Leptons also exist in six [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]]s:

Note that the neutrino masses are known to be non-zero because of [[neutrino oscillation]], but their masses are sufficiently light that they have not been measured directly as of [[2006]].

==== Bosons (integer spin)====

[[Boson]]s have whole number spins. The [[fundamental forces]] of nature are mediated by [[gauge bosons]], and mass is hypothesized to be created by the [[Higgs boson]]. According to the [[Standard Model]] the elementary bosons are:

The [[Higgs boson]] (spin-0) is predicted by [[electroweak theory]], and is the only Standard Model particle not yet observed.  In the [[Higgs mechanism]] of the Standard Model, the massive Higgs boson is created by [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] of the Higgs field. The intrinsic masses of the elementary particles (particularly the massive [[W boson|W<sup><U+00B1></sup>]] and [[Z boson|Z<sup>0</sup>]] bosons) would be explained by their interactions with this field.  Many physicists expect the Higgs to be discovered at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) [[particle accelerator]] now under construction at [[CERN]].

=== Hypothetical particles ===

[[Supersymmetry|Supersymmetric]] theories predict the existence of more particles, none of which have been confirmed experimentally [[as of 2006]].
* The [[neutralino]] (spin-<U+00BD>) is a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the [[superpartner]]s of several neutral Standard Model particles. It is a leading candidate for [[dark matter]]. The partners of charged bosons are called [[chargino]]s.
* The [[photino]] (spin-<U+00BD>) is the [[superpartner]] of the [[photon]].
* The [[gravitino]] (spin-<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>) is the [[superpartner]] of the [[graviton]] boson in [[supergravity|supergravity theories]].
* [[Slepton]]s and [[squark]]s (spin-0) are the supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model fermions. The stop squark (superpartner of the top quark) is thought to be light and is often the subject of experimental searches.

Other theories predict the existence of additional bosons.
* The [[graviton]] (spin-2) has been proposed to mediate gravity in theories of [[quantum gravity]].
* The [[axion]] (spin-0) is introduced in [[Peccei-Quinn theory]] to solve the [[strong-CP problem]].
* The [[X boson]] and the [[Y boson]] are predicted by [[grand unification theory|GUT theories]] to be heavier equivalents of the W and Z.
* The [[graviscalar]] (spin-0) and [[graviphoton]] (spin-1).
* The [[magnetic photon]].
* [[Sterile neutrino]]s are introduced by many extensions to the Standard Model, and may be needed to explain the [[LSND]] results.

[[Magnetic monopole]] is a generic name for particles with non-zero magnetic charge.  They are predicted by some GUT theories.

The [[preon]] was a suggested substructure for both quarks and leptons, but modern [[collider]] experiments have all but disproven their existence.

==Composite particles==
===Hadrons===

[[Hadron]]s are defined as [[strong interaction|strongly interacting]] composite particles. Hadrons are either:
* [[Fermion]]s, in which case they are called [[baryon]]s.
* [[Boson]]s, in which case they are called [[meson]]s.

[[Quark model]]s, first proposed in 1964 independently by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[George Zweig]] (who called quarks "aces"), describe the known hadrons as composed of valence [[quark]]s and/or antiquarks, tightly bound by the [[quantum chromodynamics|color force]], which is mediated by [[gluon]]s. A "sea" of virtual quark-antiquark pairs is also present in each hadron. 

====Baryons (fermions)====
[[Image:Decupleto bari<U+00F4>nico.png|thumb|A combination of three u, d or s-quarks with a total spin of 3/2 form the so-called '''baryon decuplet'''.]]
:''For a detailed list, see [[List of baryons]].''

Ordinary [[baryon]]s ([[fermion]]s) contain three valence quarks or three valence antiquarks each.
* [[Nucleon]]s are the fermionic constituents of normal atomic nuclei:
**[[Proton]]s
**[[Neutron]]s
* [[Hyperon]]s such as the &Lambda;, &Sigma;, &Xi;, and &Omega; particles, which contain one or more [[strange quark]]s, are short-lived and heavier than nucleons. They do not normally appear in atomic nuclei.
* A number of [[charm quark|charmed]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] baryons have also been observed.

Some hints at the existence of [[exotic baryon]]s have been found recently; however, negative results have also been reported. Their existence is uncertain.
* [[Pentaquark]]s consist of four valence quarks and one valence antiquark.

====Mesons (bosons)====
[[Image:Noneto mes<U+00F4>nico de spin 0.png|thumb|Mesons of spin 0 form a nonet]]
:''For a detailed list, see [[List of mesons]].''

Ordinary [[meson]]s ([[boson]]s) contain a valence quark and a valence antiquark, and include the [[pion]], [[kaon]], the [[J/<U+03C8>]], and many other types of mesons. In [[quantum hadrodynamics|quantum hadrodynamic]] models, the strong force between nucleons is mediated by mesons.

[[Exotic meson]]s may also exist. Positive signatures have been reported for all of these particles at some time, but their existence is still somewhat uncertain.
* [[Tetraquark]]s consist of two valence quarks and two valence antiquarks.
* [[Glueball]]s are bound states of gluons with no valence quarks.
* [[Hybrid (particle physics)|Hybrid]]s consist of one or more valence quark-antiquark pairs and one or more real gluons.

===Atomic nuclei===

[[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] consist of protons and neutrons. Each type of nucleus contains a specific number of [[proton]]s and a specific number of [[neutron]]s, and is called a [[nuclide]] or [[isotope]]. [[Nuclear reaction]]s can change one nuclide into another. See [[Isotope table (complete)]] for a list of isotopes.

===Atoms===

[[Atom]]s are the smallest neutral particles into which matter can be divided by [[chemical reaction]]s. An atom consists of a small, heavy nucleus surrounded by a relatively large, light cloud of electrons. Each type of atom corresponds to a specific [[chemical element]], of which 111 have been officially named. Refer to the [[periodic table]] for an overview.

===Molecules===

[[Molecule]]s are the smallest particles into which a non-elemental substance can be divided while maintaining the physical properties of the substance. Each type of molecule corresponds to a specific [[chemical compound]]. Molecules are composites of one or more atoms. See [[list of compounds]] for a list of molecules. 

==Condensed matter==
The field equations of [[condensed matter physics]] are remarkably similar to those of high energy particle physics.  As a result, much of the theory of particle physics applies to condensed matter physics as well; in particular, there  are a selection of field excitations, called [[quasi-particle]]s, that can be created and explored. These include:

* [[Phonon]]s are vibrational modes in a [[crystal lattice]].
* [[Exciton]]s are bound states of an [[electron]] and a [[electron hole|hole]].
* [[Plasmon]]s are coherent excitations of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].
* [[Polariton]]s are mixtures of [[photon]]s with other quasi-particles.
* [[Polaron]]s are moving, charged (quasi-) particles that are surrounded by ions in a material.
* [[Magnon]]s are coherent excitations of electron spins in a material.

==Other==

* A [[WIMP]] (weakly interacting massive particle) is any one of a number of particles that might explain [[dark matter]] (such as the [[neutralino]] or the [[axion]]).
* The [[pomeron]], used to explain the [[elastic scattering]] of hadrons and the location of [[Regge pole]]s in [[Regge theory]].
* The [[skyrmion]], a topological soliton of the [[pion]] field, used to model the low-energy properties of the [[nucleon]], such as the [[axial vector current]] coupling and the mass.
* A [[goldstone boson]] is a massless excitation of a field that has been [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]]. The [[pion]]s are quasi-Goldstone bosons (quasi- because they are not exactly massless) of the broken [[chirality|chiral]] [[isospin]] symmetry of [[quantum chromodynamics]].
* A [[goldstino]] is a Goldstone [[fermion]] produced by the spontaneous breaking of [[supersymmetry]].
* An [[instanton]] is a field configuration which is a local minimum of the Euclidean action. Instantons are used in nonperturbative calculations of tunneling rates.
* An [[Oh-My-God particle]] is an ultra-high energy [[cosmic ray]] (probably a [[proton]]) falling well beyond the [[GZK cutoff]], the energy limit beyond which virtually no cosmic rays should be detected.
* A [[spurion]] is the name given to a "particle" inserted mathematically into an isospin-violating decay in order to analyze it as though it conserved isospin.

==Categorisation by speed==
* A [[bradyon|tardyon or bradyon]] travels slower than light and has a non-zero rest mass.
* A [[luxon]] travels at the speed of light and has no rest mass.
* A [[tachyon]] is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light and has an [[imaginary number|imaginary]] rest mass.
