'''Systems management''' refers to enterprise-wide [[System administration|administration]] of distributed [[computer system]]s {{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Systems management is strongly influenced by [[network management]] initiatives in [[telecommunications]]. System management may involve one or more of the following tasks:

* Hardware inventories.
* Server availability monitoring and metrics.
* Software inventory and installation.
* [[Antivirus software|Anti-virus]] and anti-[[malware]] management.
* User's activities monitoring.
* Capacity monitoring.
* Security management.
* Storage management.
* Network capacity and utilization monitoring.

== Functions ==

Functional groups are provided according to [[ITU-T]] [[X.700]] standard. This framework is also known as [[FCAPS]].

; [[Fault management]]
:* [[Troubleshooting]], error [[data logging|logging]] and [[data recovery]]
; [[Configuration management]]
:* Hardware and software inventory
:* [[Provisioning]], [[software deployment]] and [[package management]]
; [[Accounting management]]
:* [[Billing]] and statistics gathering
; [[Performance management]]
:* [[Software metering]], event and metric monitoring
; [[Security management]]
:* [[Identity management]]
:* [[Policy appliances|Policy management]]

However this standard should not be treated as comprehensive, there are obvious omissions. Some are recently emerging sectors, some are implied and some are just not listed. The primary ones are Real-time Application Relationship Discovery which supports Configuration Management, Security Information and Event Management functions (known as SIEM), Workload Scheduling, Business Impact functions (also known as Business Systems Management) and Capacity Management. Performance Management functions can also be split into end-to-end performance measuring and infrastructure component measuring functions.  Another recently emerging sector is [[Operational Intelligence]] which focusses on real-time monitoring of business events that relate to business processes, not unlike [[Business Activity Monitoring]].

IDC has recently covered a new subsection named Business Transaction Management ("Business Transaction Management: Another Step in the Evolution of IT Management"). According to the study, BTM represents a leap forward in IT management philosophy, helping firms manage complex IT environments from a business perspective.
