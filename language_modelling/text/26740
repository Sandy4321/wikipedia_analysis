The '''ZX Spectrum''' is a [[home computer]] released in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1982 by [[Sinclair Research Ltd.]] Originally dubbed the ''ZX82'', the machine was later renamed the ''ZX Spectrum''  by Sinclair to highlight the machine's colour display, compared to the [[black-and-white]] of its predecessor, the [[Sinclair ZX81]].<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://computermuseum.50megs.com/brands/zxspectrum.htm | work = Computer Museum | last = Klooster | first = Erik | accessdate = 2006-04-19 | title = SINCLAIR ZX SPECTRUM : the good, old 'speccy' }}</ref>.

The Spectrum was the first mainstream audience home computer in the UK, similar in significance to the [[Commodore 64]] in the USA; the C64 was the main rival to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early [[1980s]]. The introduction of the ZX Spectrum led to a boom of companies producing software and hardware for it. The effects of this are still seen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6572711.stm |title=How the Spectrum began a revolution |accessdate=2007-06-05 |date=[[23 April]], [[2007]] |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

[[Image:ZXspectrum mb.jpg|right|350px|thumb|ZX Spectrum 48K motherboard (Issue 3B <U+2014> 1983)]]

The Spectrum's hardware was designed by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research. Sinclair's industrial designer [[Rick Dickinson]] was responsible for the machine's outward appearance.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/spec1648.htm | work = Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris |  accessdate = 2006-08-15 | title = ZX Spectrum 16K/48K }}</ref>

Based on a [[Zilog Z80]]A [[Central processing unit|CPU]] running at 3.5&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], the original Spectrum had 16 [[KB]] of ROM and either 16&nbsp;KB or 48&nbsp;KB of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. 

The Spectrum's video output was through an [[RF modulator]] and was designed for use with contemporary [[portable television]] sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text could be displayed using 32 columns <U+00D7> 24 rows of characters from the [[ZX Spectrum character set]], with a choice of eight colours at two levels of brightness, which gave 15 shades (black was the same in both modes).<ref>{{cite book | last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate = 2006-08-23 | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Sinclair Research Ltd]] | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap1.html }}</ref> The [[image resolution]] was 256<U+00D7>192 with the same colour limitations.<ref name="SpectrumManualChapter16">{{cite book | last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate = 2006-08-23 | year = 1982 | publisher = [[Sinclair Research Ltd]]|chapter = Colours|chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap16.html }}</ref> The Spectrum had an interesting method of handling colour; to save memory, colour "attributes" were held separately from the pixel [[bitmap]] in a 32<U+00D7>24 grid, corresponding to the character cells. An attribute consisted of a foreground and a background colour, a brightness level (normal or bright) and a flashing "flag" which, when set, caused the two colours to swap at regular intervals.<ref name="SpectrumManualChapter16"/> This scheme led to what was called ''colour clash'' or ''[[attribute clash]]'' with some bizarre effects in the animated graphics of arcade style games. This problem became a distinctive feature of the Spectrum and an in-joke among Spectrum users, as well as a point of derision by advocates of other systems. Other machines available around the same time, for example the [[Amstrad CPC]], did not suffer from this problem. The [[Commodore 64]] used colour attributes, but hardware [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s and [[scrolling]] were used to avoid attribute clash.

Sound output was through a beeper on the machine itself. This was capable of producing one channel with 10 octaves over ten semitones. The machine also included an [[expansion bus]] [[edge connector]] and audio in/out ports for the connection of a [[cassette recorder]] for loading and saving programs and data.

The machine's software was written by [[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steve Vickers]] on contract from Nine Tiles Ltd, the authors of [[Sinclair BASIC]]. The Spectrum's [[chiclet keyboard]] (on top of a membrane, similar to calculator keys) was marked with Sinclair BASIC keywords, so that, for example, pressing "G" when in programming mode would insert the BASIC command [[GO TO]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Vickers | first = Steven | title = Sinclair ZX Spectrum BASIC Programming | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/ | accessdate = 2006-09-19 | year = 1982|publisher = [[Sinclair Research Ltd]] | chapter = Basic programming concepts | chapterurl = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ZXBasicManual/zxmanchap2.html }}</ref>

The original '''ZX Spectrum''' is remembered for its 'dead flesh' (rubber) keyboard, diminutive size and distinctive rainbow motif. It was originally released in 1982 with 16 KB of RAM for <U+00A3>125 [[pound sterling|Sterling]] or with 48 KB for <U+00A3>175;<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = February | title = The High Street Spectrum | journal = ZX Computing | pages = 43 }}</ref> these prices were later reduced to <U+00A3>99 and <U+00A3>129 respectively.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = June | title = News: Spectrum prices are slashed | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 15 | pages = 13 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/015/news.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-15 }}</ref> Owners of the 16 KB model could purchase an internal 32 KB RAM upgrade, which for early "Issue 1" machines consisted of a  [[daughterboard]]. Later issue machines required the fitting of 8 [[Dynamic Random Access Memory|dynamic RAM]] chips and a few [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] chips. Users could mail their 16K Spectrums to Sinclair to be upgraded to 48 KB versions. To reduce the price, the 32 KB extension used eight faulty 64&nbsp;[[kilobit]] chips with only one half of their capacity working and/or available.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Goodwin | first = Simon | year = 1984 | month = September | title = Suddenly, it's the 64K Spectrum!|journal = [[Your Spectrum]] | issue = 7 | pages = 33<U+2013>34 | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr07/yr07_33.htm|accessdate = 2006-08-21 }}</ref> External 32 KB RAMpacks that mounted in the rear expansion slot were also available from third parties. Both machines had 16 KB of onboard ROM.

Approximately 60,000 "Issue 1" ZX Spectrums were manufactured; they can be distinguished from later models by the colour of the keys (light grey for Issue 1, blue-grey for later models).<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/spec48versions.htm | work = Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate = 2006-04-24 | title = Spectrum 48K Versions }}</ref>

[[Image:ZX Spectrum+.jpg|thumb|right|200px|ZX Spectrum+ (Dimensions (mm): 319x149x38 (WxHxD)).<ref name=HCHOF />]]

Planning of the '''ZX Spectrum+''' started in June 1984,<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1984 | month = December | title = The Secret That Was Spectrum+ | journal = Your Spectrum | issue = 10 | pages = 104 | url = http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jg27paw4/yr10/yr10_a4.htm | last = Denham | first = Sue | accessdate = 2006-08-21 }}</ref> and was released in October the same year.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/zxspectrum/specplus.htm | work=Planet Sinclair | last = Owen | first = Chris | accessdate=2006-08-21 | title=ZX Spectrum+}}</ref> This 48 KB Spectrum (development code-name ''TB'') introduced a new [[Sinclair QL|QL]]-style enclosure with a much needed injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button, retailing for <U+00A3>179.95.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1984 | month = December|title = News: New Spectrum launch|journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 33 | pages = 11 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/033/news.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-19 }}</ref> A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was also available.  Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported very high failure rates.

[[Image:ZX Spectrum128K.jpg|thumb|200px|right|ZX Spectrum 128]]

Sinclair developed the '''ZX Spectrum 128''' (code-named ''Derby'') in conjunction with their Spanish distributor [[Investr<U+00F3>nica]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bourne | first = Chris | year = 1985 | month = November|title = News: Launch of the Spectrum 128 in Spain|journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 44 | pages = 5 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/044/news.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-15 }}</ref>  Investr<U+00F3>nica had helped adapt the ZX Spectrum+ to the Spanish market after the Spanish government introduced a special tax on all computers with 64&nbsp;KB RAM or less which did not support the Spanish alphabet (including [[<U+00F1>]]) and show messages in Spanish.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.micromart.co.uk/default.aspx?contentid=0a437af8-b1f5-4ffc-a6c8-f567007946de&featureid=2913 | accessdate=2006-08-15 | title=Why QWERTY}}</ref>

New features included 128&nbsp;KB RAM, three-channel audio via the [[AY-3-8912]] chip, [[MIDI]] compatibility, an [[RS-232]] serial port, an [[RGB]] monitor port, 32&nbsp;KB of ROM including an improved BASIC editor and an external keypad.

The machine was simultaneously presented for the first time and launched in September 1985 at the [[SIMO TCI|SIMO '85]] trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 [[pesetas]].  Because of the large amount of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of <U+00A3>179.95.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1985 | month = April|title = Clive discovers games <U+2014> at last|journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 49 | pages = 53 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/049/128lnch.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-20 }}</ref>  No external keypad was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to utilise it and the port itself, which was hastily renamed "AUX", remained.

The Z80 processor used in the Spectrum has a 16-bit address bus, which means only 64&nbsp;KB of memory can be directly addressed.  To facilitate the extra 80&nbsp;KB of RAM the designers utilised [[bank switching]] so that the new memory would be available as eight pages of 16&nbsp;KB at the top of the address space.  The same technique was also used to page between the new 16&nbsp;KB editor ROM and the original 16&nbsp;KB BASIC ROM at the bottom of the address space.

The new sound chip and [[MIDI]] out abilities were exposed to the BASIC programming language with the command ''PLAY'' and a new command ''SPECTRUM'' was added to switch the machine into 48K mode.  To enable BASIC programmers to access the additional memory, a RAM disk was created where files could be stored in the additional 80&nbsp;KB of RAM.  The new commands took the place of two existing user-defined-character spaces causing compatibility problems with some BASIC programs.

The Spanish version had the "128K" [[logo]] (right, bottom of the computer) in white colour while the English one had the same logo in red colour.

=== Amstrad models ===
[[Image:ZX Spectrum Plus2.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|ZX Spectrum +2]]

The '''ZX Spectrum +2''' was [[Amstrad]]'s first Spectrum, coming shortly after their [[Sinclair Research Ltd#Trouble and Amstrad acquisition|purchase of the Spectrum range and "Sinclair" brand]] in 1986. The machine featured an all-new grey enclosure featuring a spring-loaded keyboard, dual joystick ports, and a built-in cassette recorder dubbed the "Datacorder" (like the [[Amstrad CPC 464]]), but was (in all user-visible respects) otherwise identical to the ZX Spectrum 128.  Production costs had been reduced and the retail price dropped to <U+00A3>139<U+2013><U+00A3>149.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Phillips | first = Max | year = 1986 | month = November|title = ZX Spectrum +2|journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 11 | pages = 47 | url = http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/spectrumplustworeview.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref>

The new keyboard did not include the BASIC keyword markings that were found on earlier Spectrums, except for the keywords ''LOAD'', ''CODE'' and ''RUN'' which were useful for loading software.  However, the layout remained identical to that of the 128.

[[Image:ZX Spectrum Plus3.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|ZX Spectrum +3]]

The '''ZX Spectrum +3''' looked similar to the +2 but featured a built-in 3-inch [[floppy disk]] drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for <U+00A3>249<ref>{{cite journal | last = South | first = Phil | year = 1987 | month = July | title = It's here... the Spectrum +3 | journal = [[Your Sinclair]] | issue = 17|pages = 22-23 }}</ref> and then later <U+00A3>199<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Amstrad]] | year = 1987 | month = November | title = The new Sinclair has one big disk advantage | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 68|pages = 2<U+2013>3 }}</ref> and was the only Spectrum capable of running the [[CP/M]] operating system without additional hardware.

The +3 saw the addition of two more 16 KB ROMs, now physically implemented as two 32 KB chips.  One was home to the second part of the reorganised 128 ROM and the other hosted the +3's disk operating system. This was a modified version of Amstrad's [[AMSDOS]], called +3DOS.  To facilitate the new ROMs and CP/M, the bank-switching was further improved, allowing the ROM to be paged out for another 16 KB of RAM.
[[Image:SpectrumPlus3Menu.gif|left|thumb|Power-on menu on ZX Spectrum +3.]]

Such core changes brought incompatibilities:
* Removal of several lines on the expansion bus edge connector (video, power, and IORQGE); caused many external devices problems; some such as the VTX5000 modem could be used via the "FixIt" device
* Divide ROMCS into 2 lines, for disable the both ROMs
* Reading a non-existent I/O port no longer returned the last attribute; caused some games such as ''[[Arkanoid]]'' to be unplayable
* Memory timing changes; some of the RAM banks were now contended causing high-speed colour-changing effects to fail
* The keypad scanning routines from the ROM were removed
* move 1 byte address in ROM

Some older 48K, and a few older 128K, games were incompatible with the machine.

The +3 was the final official model of the Spectrum to be manufactured, remaining in production until December 1990. Although still accounting for one third of all home computer sales at the time, production of the model was ceased by Amstrad in an attempt to transfer customers to their CPC range.

[[Image:Spectrum_128-2.png|200px|right|thumb|ZX Spectrum +2A.]]

The '''ZX Spectrum +2A''' was produced to homogenise Amstrad's range in 1987. Although the case reads "ZX Spectrum +2", the +2A/B is easily distinguishable from the original +2 as the case was restored to the standard Spectrum black. 

The +2A was derived from Amstrad's +3 4.1 ROM model, using a new motherboard which vastly reduced the chip count, integrating many of them into a new [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]. The +2A replaced the +3's disk drive and associated hardware with a tape drive, as in the original +2. Originally, Amstrad planned to introduce an additional disk interface, but this never appeared.  If an external disk drive was added, the "+2A" on the system OS menu would change to a +3.  As with the ZX Spectrum +3, some older 48K, and a few older 128K, games were incompatible with the machine.

The '''ZX Spectrum +2B''' signified a manufacturing move from Hong Kong to Taiwan later in 1987.

Some board of +2A and +2B have a full board like a +3, but without disk controller chips, in a new version, reduce this space, and lines, the board is a bit in down right corner

=== Clones ===
{{seealso|Category:ZX Spectrum clones}}

Sinclair licensed the Spectrum design to [[Timex Corporation]] in the United States. An enhanced version of the Spectrum with better sound, graphics and other modifications was marketed in the USA by Timex as the [[Timex Sinclair 2068]]. Timex's derivatives were largely incompatible with Sinclair systems. However, some of the Timex innovations were later adopted by Sinclair Research. A case in point was the abortive ''Pandora'' portable Spectrum, whose [[Uncommitted Logic Array|ULA]] had the high resolution video mode pioneered in the TS2068. ''Pandora'' had a flat-screen monitor and Microdrives and was intended to be Sinclair's business portable until [[Alan Sugar]] bought the computer side of Sinclair, when he took one look at it and ditched it (a conversation with UK computer journalist [[Guy Kewney]] went thus: AS: "Have you seen it?" GK: "Yes" AS: "Well then.").<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title = Sinclair Loki Superspectrum |author = Rupert Goodwins |date = [[2002-05-12]] |newsgroup = comp.sys.sinclair |id = 3cde626f.45085128@news-text.blueyonder.co.uk |url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.sinclair/msg/6bdb4bd808bdb3d6?dmode=source |accessdate = 2006-11-08 }}</ref>

In the UK, Spectrum peripheral vendor [[Miles Gordon Technology]] (MGT) released the [[SAM Coup<U+00E9>]] as a potential successor with some Spectrum compatibility. However, by this point, the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] had taken hold of the market, leaving MGT in eventual receivership.

Many unofficial Spectrum clones were produced, especially in [[Eastern Bloc]] nations (e.g. in Romania, there were some models produced, like HC-85, HC-86 and CIP-02 and CIP03, the last one being a clone of Spectrum +3, featuring CP/M and a 3.5" disk) and [[South America]] (e.g. Microdigital [[TK 90X]]; Czerweny CZ-2000). In Russia for example, ZX Spectrum clones were assembled by thousands of small start-ups and distributed though poster ads and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvg.org/sinclair/computers/clones/clones.htm | title = Clones and variants | accessdate = 2006-10-26 | last = Owen | first = Chris | work = Planet Sinclair }}</ref> Some of them are still being produced, such as the ''[[Pentagon (computer)|Pentagon]]'' and ''[[ATM Turbo]]''.

In India, Decibells Electronics introduced a licensed version of the Spectrum+ in 1986. Dubbed the "db Spectrum+", it did reasonably well in the Indian market and sold quite a few thousands before the market slowly died away by 1990 or so.

[[Image:Kempston_joystick_interface.jpeg|150px|right|thumb|Kempston joystick interface]]
Several peripherals for the Spectrum were marketed by Sinclair: the [[Spark printer|ZX Printer]] was already on the market,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvg.ntnu.no/sinclair/computers/peripherals/zxprinter.htm | title = ZX Printer | accessdate = 2006-08-24 | last = Owen | first = Chris|work = Planet Sinclair}}</ref> as the ZX Spectrum expansion [[computer bus|bus]] was [[backwards-compatible]] with that of the ZX81.

The [[ZX Interface 1]] add-on module included 8&nbsp;KB of ROM, an [[RS-232]] serial port, a proprietary [[LAN]] interface (called ZX Net), and an interface for the connection of up to eight [[ZX Microdrive]]s <U+2014> somewhat unreliable but speedy tape-loop cartridge storage devices released in July 1983.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = September | title = News: Some surprises in the Microdrive | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 18 | pages = 15 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/018/news.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Adams | first = Stephen | year = 1983 | month = October | title = Hardware World: Spectrum receives its biggest improvement | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 19 | pages = 27<U+2013>29 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/019/hardwre.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref> These were later used in a revised version on the [[Sinclair QL]], whose storage format was electrically compatible but logically incompatible with the Spectrum's. Sinclair also released the [[ZX Interface 2]] which added two joystick ports and a ROM cartridge port.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = December|title = Hardware World: Sinclair cartridges may be out of step|journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 21 | pages = 35 | url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/021/hardwre.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref>

There were also a plethora of third-party hardware addons. The better known of these included the [[Kempston Interface|Kempston joystick interface]], the [[Morex Peripherals]] [[Centronics]]/RS-232 interface, the [[Currah]] Microspeech unit (speech synthesis),<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1983 | month = December | title = Hardware World: Clear speech from Currah module | journal = [[Sinclair User]] | issue = 21 | pages = 40|url = http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/021/hardwre.htm|accessdate = 2006-08-29}}</ref> [[Videoface]] Digitiser, RAM pack, and [[Cheetah Marketing]] SpecDrum (Drum machine), and the [[Multiface]] (snapshot and disassembly tool), from Romantic Robot.

There were numerous disk drive interfaces, including the [[Abbeydale Designers]]/[[Watford Electronics]] SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/[[Kempston Micro Electronics|Kempston]] KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces were the first to come bundled with Office productivity software (''[[Tasword]]'' Word Processor, ''Masterfile'' database and ''[[OmniCalc]]'' spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced many small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the [[DISCiPLE]] and [[+D]] systems released by [[Miles Gordon Technology]] in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk ''snapshots'' could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were also both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.

During the mid-[[1980s]], the company [[Micronet800]] launched a service allowing users to connect their ZX Spectrums via a [[Prism Micro Products]] [[modem]] to a [[bulletin board system]] known as [[Micronet]] hosted by [[Prestel]]. This service had some similarities to the [[Internet]], but was proprietary and fee-based.

== Software ==
{{main|ZX Spectrum software}}

The Spectrum enjoys a vibrant, dedicated fan-base. Since it was cheap and simple to learn to use and program, the Spectrum was the starting point for many programmers and technophiles who remember it with nostalgia. The hardware limitations of the Spectrum imposed a special level of creativity on game designers, and for this reason, many Spectrum games are very creative and playable even by today's standards. The early Spectrum models' great success as a games platform came in spite of its lack of built-in joystick ports, primitive sound generation, and colour support that was optimised for text display.

The Spectrum family enjoys a very large software library of more than 14,000 titles.<ref name="WoS-archive">{{cite web | url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/archive.html | work=World of Spectrum | last = Heide | first = Martijn van der | accessdate=2006-08-11 | title=Archive!}}</ref> While the majority of these were games, its software library was very diverse, including programming language implementations, databases (eg ''[[VU-File]]''<ref name="zappowboom">{{cite journal |last=Pearce |first=Nick |year=1982 |month=October/November |title=Zap! Pow! Boom! |journal=ZX Computing |pages=75}}</ref>), word processors (eg ''[[Tasword]] II''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wetherill |first=Steven |year=1984 |month=June |title=Tasword Two: The Word Processor |journal=CRASH! |issue=5 |pages=126}}</ref>), [[spreadsheet]]s (eg ''[[VU-Calc]]''<ref name="zappowboom"/>), drawing and painting tools (eg ''[[OCP Art Studio]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilbert |first=John |year=1985 |month=October |title=Art Studio |journal=Sinclair User |issue=43 |pages=28 |url=http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/043/sftwreb.htm |accessdate=2007-01-18 }}</ref>), and even 3D modelling (eg ''VU-3D''<ref>{{cite journal |last=Carter |first=Alasdair |year=1983 |month=October/November |title=VU-3D |journal=ZX Computing |pages=76<U+2013>77}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bioeddie.co.uk/Spectrum/vu-3d.htm |title=Psion Vu-3D |accessdate=2007-01-18}}</ref>).

=== Distribution ===

Most Spectrum software was originally distributed on [[audio cassette tape]]s. The Spectrum was intended to work with almost any cassette tape player, and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process was quite reliable.

While the ZX Microdrive quickly became quite popular with the Spectrum user base due to the low cost of the drives, the actual media was very expensive for software publishers to use for mass market releases (by a factor of 10<U+00D7> compared to tape duplication). Furthermore, the cartridges themselves acquired a reputation  for unreliability, and publishers were reluctant to [[Quality Assurance|QA]] each and every item shipped.<ref>{{ cite journal | title = Microdrive revisited | journal = CRASH | year = 1985 | month = November | issue = 22 | url = http://www.crashonline.org.uk/22/opinion.htm|accessdate = 2006-08-10 }}</ref> Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the ''Tasword'' [[word processing]] software and the aforementioned ''Trans Express''. No games are known to be exclusively released on Microdrive.

Despite the popularity of the DISCiPLE and +D systems, most software released for them took the form of utility software. The ZX Spectrum +3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on floppy disk. More than 700 titles were released on 3-inch disk from 1987 to 1997.<ref name="WoS-archive"/>

Software was also distributed through print media, fan magazines and books.  The prevalent language for distribution was the Spectrum's BASIC dialect [[Sinclair BASIC]]. The reader would type the software into the computer by hand, run it, and save it to tape for later use.  The software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its [[assembly language]] counterparts, and lacked graphics. But soon, magazines were printing long lists of [[checksum]]med [[hexadecimal]] digits with machine code games or tools. There was a vibrant scientific community built around such software, ranging from [[satellite dish]] alignment programs to school classroom scheduling programs.

Another, unusual, software distribution method was to broadcast the audio stream from the cassette on another medium and have users record it onto an audio cassette themselves. In radio or television shows in e.g. [[Croatia]] (Radio 101), [[Serbia]] ([[Ventilator 202]]), [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Italy]] ([[RAI Radio3]]), [[Portugal]] or [[Brazil]], the host would describe a program, instruct the audience to connect a cassette tape recorder to the radio or TV and then broadcast the program over the airwaves in audio format. Some magazines distributed 7" 33<U+2153> rpm ''[[flexidisc]]'' records, a variant of regular [[vinyl record]]s which could be played on a standard record player. These disks were known as ''[[floppy ROM]]s''.

=== Copying and backup software ===

Most copier software available for the Spectrum was designed for [[copyright infringement of software]] through tape duplication. Copiers were developed to copy programs from audio tape to microdrive tapes, and later on diskettes. Complex loaders with unusual speeds or encoding were the basis of the Spectrum's [[copy prevention]] schemes, although other methods were used including asking for a particular word from the documentation included with the game <U+2014> often a novella <U+2014> or another physical device distributed in the software box (e.g. [[Lenslok]]). As protection became more complex it was almost impossible to use copiers to copy tapes, and the loaders had to be cracked by hand, to produce unprotected versions. Special hardware such as Romantic Robot's [[Multiface]] was able to dump a copy of the ZX Spectrum RAM to disk/tape at the press of a button, entirely circumventing the copy protection systems.

Most Spectrum software has been digitised in recent years and is available for download in digital form. One popular program for digitising Spectrum software is ''Taper'': it allows connecting a cassette tape player to the [[line in]] port of a [[sound card]] or, through a simple home-built device, to the [[parallel port]] of a PC.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.worldofspectrum.org/taper.html | title = Taper | accessdate = 2006-10-26 |  last = Heide|first = Martijn van der}}</ref> Once in digital form, the software can be executed on one of many existing emulators, on virtually any platform available today. Today, the largest on-line archive of ZX Spectrum software is [[World of Spectrum]], with more than 12,000 titles. The legality of this practice is still in question and a number of authors have explicitly objected to the posting of their software, with which some Spectrum [[abandonware]] sites have usually complied. However, for the majority of the software it seems unlikely that any action will ever be taken.

=== Notable Spectrum developers ===

A number of current leading games developers and development companies began their careers on the ZX Spectrum, including [[David Perry]] of [[Shiny Entertainment]], and  [[Tim Stamper (programmer)|Tim]] and [[Chris Stamper]] (founders of [[Ultimate Play The Game]], now known as [[Rare (company)|Rare]], maker of many famous titles for [[Nintendo]] and [[Xbox]] game consoles).  Other prominent games developers include [[Matthew Smith (games programmer)|Matthew Smith]] (''[[Manic Miner]]'', ''[[Jet Set Willy]]''), [[Jon Ritman]] (''[[Match Day]]'', ''[[Head Over Heels (game)|Head Over Heels]]''), [[Sid Meier]] (''[[Silent Service (video game)|Silent Service]]'' <ref>{{cite journal | year = 1987 | month = March | title = Silent Service | journal = [[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]] | issue = 38 | pages = 79<U+2013>80}}</ref>), [[Oliver Twins|The Oliver Twins]] (the [[Dizzy series|''Dizzy'' series]]), [[Clive Townsend]] (''[[Saboteur (video game)|Saboteur]]'') and [[Alan Cox]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.softpanorama.org/People/Cox/index.shtml | title = Alan Cox: and the Art of Making Beta Code Work | accessdate = 2007-01-18 | last = Bezroukov | first = Nikolai | work = Portraits of Open Source Pioneers}}</ref>.

== Community ==
The ZX Spectrum enjoyed a very strong community early on.  Several dedicated [[computer magazine|magazines]] were released including  ''[[Sinclair User]]'' (1982), ''[[Your Sinclair]]'' (1983) and ''[[CRASH (magazine)|CRASH]]'' (1984).  Early on they were very technically oriented with type-in programs and machine code tutorials.  Later on they became almost only games oriented.  Several general contemporary computer magazines covered the ZX Spectrum in more or less detail.  They included ''[[Computer Gamer]]'', ''[[Computer and Video Games (magazine)|Computer and Video Games]]'', ''[[Computing Today]]'', ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'', ''[[Your Computer (British magazine)|Your Computer]]'' and ''[[The Games Machine]]''.

More than 80 electronic [[computer magazine|magazines]] existed, mostly in [[Russian language|Russian]]. Most notable of them were [[AlchNews]] (UK), [[ZX-Format]] (Russia), and [[Spectrofon]] (Russia).
