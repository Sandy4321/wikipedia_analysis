{{dablink|For information on this form of gaming in general, see [[computer and video games]].}}

A '''personal computer game''' (or simply '''PC game''') is a [[video game]] played on a [[personal computer]]. Unlike [[console game]]s, PC games may be played on a device that is not designed solely for that purpose, although computers optimised for gaming (known as [[gaming PC]]s) have become popular in recent times. As with any [[computer and video game|video game]], they require an output device such as a [[monitor]], and are controlled by common input devices such as a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] or [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]].

Personal computer game are usually distributed using standard storage units for personal computers, such as [[compact disc]]s and most recently, [[DVD]]s. [[Floppy disk]]s have also been widely used in the past, and certain games are also distributed via the [[Internet]] through services such as [[Direct2Drive]] or from developers' websites, such as [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]].

==History==
===Early growth===
[[Image:Spacewar1.png|thumb|right|''[[Spacewar!]]'', developed for the [[PDP-1]] in [[1961]], is often credited as being the first ever computer game. The game consisted of two player-controlled spaceships maneuvering around a central star, each attempting to destroy the other.]]
Although computers have become commonplace only in recent times, since they were prohibitively expensive and bulky until the development of the [[microprocessor]], they have been used for [[computer and video games|computer gaming]] since at least the 1960s. One of the first computer games was developed in [[1961]], when [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] students Martin Graetz and Alan Kotok, with MIT employee Stephen Russell, developed ''[[Spacewar!]]'' on a [[PDP-1]] computer used for statistical calculations.<ref name="spacewar">{{cite book | author = Levy, Steven | year = 1984 | title = [[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution]] | publisher = Anchor Press/Doubleday | id = ISBN 0385191952 }}</ref>

The first generation of games were often [[text game|text adventures]] or [[interactive fiction]], in which the player communicated with the computer by entering commands through a keyboard.  The first text-adventure, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure|Adventure]]'', was developed for the PDP-11 in [[1972]].<ref name="adventure">{{cite web|url=http://www.thocp.net/software/games/golden_age.htm |title=Chronology of the History of Video Games |accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>   By the [[1980s]], personal computers had become powerful enough to run games like ''Adventure'', but by this time, graphics were beginning to become an important factor in games.  Later games combined textual commands with basic graphics, as seen in the SSI [[Gold Box]] games such as ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'', or the original ''[[Bard's Tale (1985)|Bard's Tale]]''.

===The video game crash of 1983===
{{main|Video game crash of 1983}}
As the video game market became flooded with poor-quality games as numerous companies attempted to enter the market, and major releases such as the [[Atari 2600]] adaptation of ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600)|E.T.]]'' failed to impress consumers, the popularity of personal computers for education rose dramatically. As a result, in [[1983 in video gaming|1983]], consumer interest in video games dwindled to historical lows, and there was a major upswing in personal computer gaming.<ref name="crash">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedoteaters.com/p3_stage6.php |title=Player 3 Stage 6: The Great Videogame Crash |accessdate=2006-08-16 |date=1999-04-07}}</ref>

===New Genres===
Increasing adoption of the [[computer mouse]] and high resolution [[bitmap]] displays allowed the industry to include [[GUI|graphical interfaces]] in new releases. Meanwhile, the [[Commodore Amiga]] computer achieved great success in the market from its release in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], contributing to the rapid adoption of these new interface technologies.<ref name="amiga">{{cite web|url=http://oldcomputers.net/amiga1000.html |title=Commodore Amiga 1000 Computer |accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref>

[[Image:Wolf3dtitle.gif|thumb|right|240px|''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', released as [[Personal computer game#Shareware|shareware]] by [[id Software]] in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]], is widely regarded as having popularised the [[first person shooter]] genre of computer games.]]
The [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre was created with the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]], and remains one of the highest-selling genres today.<ref name="fpssales">{{cite web| url =http://gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8241 | title =Analysts: FPS 'Most Attractive' Genre for Publishers | accessdate =2006-08-17 | last =Cifaldi | first =Frank | date =2006-02-21}}</ref> The game was originally distributed through the [[shareware|shareware distribution model]], allowing players to try a limited part of the game for free but requiring payment to play the rest, and represented one of the first uses of [[texture mapping]] graphics in a popular game.<ref name="texturemapping">{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2003/05/05/doom/index.html?pn=2 |title=Masters of "Doom" |accessdate=2006-09-23 |last=James |first=Wagner}}</ref>

While leading [[Sega]] and [[Nintendo]] console systems kept their CPU speed at 3-7 MHz, the [[Intel 80486|486]] PC processor ran much faster at 66 MHz, allowing it to perform many more calculations per second. The [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] release of ''[[Doom]]'' on the PC was a breakthrough in 3D graphics, and was soon ported to various game consoles in a general shift toward greater realism.<ref name="realismshift">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepilgrimage.com/Consolehistory2.htm |title=Console history |accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref>

Many early PC games included extras such as the peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped with ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. These extras gradually became less common, but many games were still sold in the traditional over-sized boxes that used to hold the extra "[[feelies]]". Today, such extras are usually found only in Special Edition versions of games, such as Battlechests from [[Blizzard]].<ref name="feelies">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/print/62/11 |title=Feelies |accessdate=2006-09-24 |last=Varney |first=Allen}}</ref>

===Contemporary gaming===
[[Image:FEAR screenshot3.png|thumb|right|240px|The high quality graphics of ''[[F.E.A.R.]]'' demonstrate the complex visual effects common in modern PC games.]]
By 1995, the rise of [[Microsoft Windows]] and success of 3D console titles such as [[Super Mario 64]] sparked great interest in [[3D acceleration|hardware accelerated 3D graphics]] on the PC, and soon resulted in attempts to produce affordable solutions with the [[ATI]] ''Rage'', [[Matrox]] ''Mystique'' and [[S3 ViRGE|Silicon Graphics]] ''ViRGE''. As 3D graphics libraries such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]] matured and knocked proprietary interfaces out of the market, these platforms gained greater acceptance in the market, particularly with their demonstrated benefits in games such as ''[[Unreal]]''.<ref name="unreal">Shamma, Tahsin. [http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/unreal/review.html Review of Unreal], Gamespot.com, June 10, 1998.</ref> However, major changes to the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, by then the market leader, made many older [[MS-DOS]]-based based unplayable on [[Windows NT]], and later, [[Windows XP]].<ref name="dosincompatibility">{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/games/expert/durham_og.mspx |title=Getting Older Games to Run on Windows XP |accessdate=2006-09-22 |last=Durham, Jr. |first=Joel |date=2006-05-14}}</ref>

The faster graphics accelerators and improving [[Central processing unit|CPU]] technology have resulted in ever-increasing levels of realism that characterise contemporary PC gaming. During this time, the improvements introduced with products such as [[ATI]]'s [[Radeon R300]] and [[NVidia]]'s [[GeForce 6 Series]] have allowed game developers to increase the complexity of modern [[game engine]]s. PC gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements in 3D graphics.<ref name="gamingtrend">{{cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/articles/3D/3DGraphicsTrens.shtm |title=Brief Glimpse into the Future of 3D Game Graphics |accessdate=2006-09-23 |last=Necasek |first=Michal |date=2006-10-30}}</ref>

Unlike the generally accepted push for improved graphical performance, the use of [[physics engine]]s in computer games has become a matter of debate since announcement and recent release of the [[AGEIA]] [[PhysX|PhysX]] [[physics processing unit|PPU]], ostensibly competing with [[middleware]] such as the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics engine]]. The new technology has prompted argument over the viability of hardware accelerated physics in video games, as with [[Graphics processing unit|accelerated graphics]]. In particular, the difficulty in ensuring that players' experiences are consistent with or without an installed PPU,<ref name="ppumultiplayer">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060514-6828.html |title=Tim Sweeney ponders the future of physics cards |accessdate=2006-08-22 |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |date=2006-05-14}}</ref> and the uncertain value of first generation PhsyX cards in games such as [[Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter]]<ref name="grawppubenchmark">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=245 |title=AGEIA PhysX PPU Videos - Ghost Recon and Cell Factor |accessdate=2006-08-22 |last=Shrout |first=Ryan |date=2006-05-02 }}</ref> and [[City of Villains]],<ref name="covppubenchmark">{{cite web|url=http://anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2828 |title=PhysX Performance Update: City of Villains  |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Smith |first=Ryan |date=2006-09-07 }}</ref> have provoked an ongoing dispute over the benefits of such emerging new technologies.

Similarly, recent years have seen many game publishers experimenting with new forms of game marketing. Chief among these new strategies is [[Episodic games|episodic gaming]], an adaptation of the older concept of [[expansion pack]]s, in which game content is provided in smaller quantities but for a proportionally lower price. Recent titles such as [[Half-Life 2: Episode One]] have taken advantage of the new idea, with mixed results rising from concerns for the amount of content provided for the price.<ref name="episodereactions">{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2aftermath/review.html|title=Half Life 2: Episode One for PC Review|accessdate=2006-09-02|year=2006|month=June}}</ref>

==PC game development==
{{main|Game development}}

Game development, as with [[console game]]s, is generally undertaken by one or more [[game developer]]s using either standardised or proprietary tools. While games could previously be developed by very small groups of people, as in the early example of [[Wolfenstein 3D]], many popular computer games today require large development teams and budgets running into the millions of dollars.<ref name="devcosts">{{cite web| url =http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060405/wardell_01.shtml | title =Postmortem: Stardock's
Galactic Civilizations II: Dread Lords | accessdate =2006-09-13 | last =Wardell | first =Brad | date =2006-04-05}}</ref>

PC games are usually built around a central piece of software, known as a [[game engine]],<ref name="gameengine">{{cite web| url =http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,594,00.asp | title =Game Engine Anatomy 101, Part I   | accessdate =2006-09-22 | last =Simpson | first =Jake | Month =April| Year =2002}}</ref> that simplifies the development process and enables developers to easily port their projects between platforms. Unlike most consoles, which generally only run major engines such as [[Unreal Engine technology#Unreal Engine 3.0|Unreal Engine 3]] and [[RenderWare]] due to restrictions on [[homebrew]] software, personal computers may run games developed using a larger range of software. As such, a number of alternatives to expensive engines have become available, including [[open source]] solutions such as [[Crystal Space]], [[OGRE Engine|OGRE]] and [[DarkPlaces]].

===User-created modifications===
[[Image:Counter-Strike Box.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Counter-Strike]]'', a total-conversion mod for [[Valve Software]]'s ''[[Half-Life]]'', achieved great popularity online and was subsequently purchased by Valve.]]
:''Main article: [[Mod (computer gaming)]]''
The multi-purpose nature of personal computers often allows users to modify the content of installed games with relative ease. Since console games are generally difficult to modify without a proprietary [[software development kit]], and are often protected by legal<ref name="modlegality">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/21/ps2_mod_chip_win/|title=Judge deems PS2 mod chips illegal in UK|accessdate=2006-09-22|year=2004|month=July}}</ref> and physical<ref name="modbarriers">{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050910-5296.html|title=Xbox 360 designed to be unhackable|accessdate=2006-09-22|year=2005|month=October}}</ref> barriers against tampering and [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew software]], it is generally easier to modify the personal computer version of games using common, easy-to-obtain software. Users can then distribute their customised version of the game (commonly known as a ''mod'') by any means they choose.

Modding had allowed much of the community to produce game elements that would not normally be provided by the developer of the game. This may unlock or introduce objectionable content, such as the famous [[Hot Coffee mod|a third party modification]] modification to  ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', but are generally used to expand or modify normal gameplay.

==Distribution==
===Traditional distribution===
Typically, computer games are sold at retail on standard storage media, such as [[compact disc]]s, [[DVD]], and [[floppy disk]]s.<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://www.iconocast.com/News_Files/BNews6_21_06/Biz1.htm|
title= The Next Billion Dollar Videogame  Opportunity|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> Different formats of [[floppy disk]]s were initially the staple storage media of the 1980s and early 1990s, but have fallen out of practical use as the increasing sophistication of computer games raised the overall size of the game's data and program files.

The introduction of complex [[graphics engine]]s in recent times has resulted in additional storage requirements for modern games, and thus an increasing interest in [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s as the next compact storage media for personal computer games. The rising popularity of DVD drives in modern PCs, and the larger capacity of the new media (a single-layer DVD can hold up to 4.7 [[gigabyte]]s of data, more than five times as much as a single CD), have resulted in their adoption as a format for computer game distribution. To date, CD versions are still offered for most games, while some games offer both the CD and the DVD versions.

===Shareware===
{{main|Shareware|Game demo}}
Shareware marketing, whereby a limited or demonstration version of the full game is released to prospective buyers without charge, has been used as a method of distributing computer games since the early years of the gaming industry. Shareware games generally offer only a small part of the gameplay offered in the retail product, and may be distributed with gaming magazines, in retail stores or on developers' websites free of charge.

In the early 1990s, shareware distribution was common among fledging game companies such as [[Apogee Software]], [[Epic Games|Epic Megagames]] and [[id Software]], and remains a popular distribution method among smaller game developers. However, shareware has largely fallen out of favor among established game companies in favour of traditional retail marketing, with some notable exceptions such as [[Big Fish Games]] and [[PopCap Games]] continuing to use the model today.<ref>{{cite news|

title=The return of shareware|date=June 18, 2003|author=Chris Morris|accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref>

===Online delivery===
[[Image:Steam3beta.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] content delivery system allows users to preload games prior to their release.]]
With the increased popularity of the [[Internet]], online distribution of game content has become more common.<ref>{{cite web|
url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/2005/09/22/news_6134035.html?sid=6134035 |
title=Spot On: The (new) dawn of digital distribution|date=June 18, 2003 |author=Brendan Sinclair|accessdate=2006-09-23}}</ref> Retail services such as [[Direct2Drive]] and [[Download.com]] allow users to purchase and download large games that would otherwise only be distributed on physical media, such as [[DVD]]s, as well as providing cheap distribution of shareware and demonstration games. Other services, such as [[GameTap]], allow a subscription-based distribution model in which users pay a monthly to download and play as many games as they wish.

The [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] system, developed by [[Valve Corporation]], provides an alternative to traditional online services. Instead of allowing the player to download a game and play it immediately, some games are made available for "pre-load" in an encrypted form days or weeks before their actual release date. On the official release date, a relatively small component is made available to unlock the game.

==Popular and notable genres of PC gaming==
{{seealso|Computer and video game genres}}
<!--NOTE: List of game genres has been removed per suggestion on the talk page.-->
Personal computers have at times been superior to their equivalent video game consoles, and thus capable of playing more graphically sophisticated games and prompting the rise of entire genres such as the [[first person shooter]]. However, the two platforms have largely converged in processing power with upcoming [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation video game consoles]] such as the [[Playstation 3]], and the [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] release of the [[Xbox 360]].

The [[real time strategy]] genre has found very little success outside of personal computers, with releases such as [[Starcraft 64]] failing in the marketplace due difficulties in playing the game using the [[Nintendo 64]] controller, and other changes from the original version.<ref name="nintendo">{{cite web | author = Joe Fielder| title = StarCraft 64| work = Gamespot.com |date = [[2000-05-12]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/n64/strategy/starcraft64/review.html?q=starcraft%2064| accessdate = 2006-08-19}}</ref> Specifically, console [[joystick]]s and [[gamepad]]s are able to reproduce neither the quick, accurate movements of a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], nor the wide range of simultaneous input options of a [[keyboard]]. Notable exceptions include [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]], released for the [[Xbox 360]] in a modified form in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]].

Conversely, genres such as [[racing game]]s have found considerable success with the analog joysticks found on modern console controllers, since these allow for sustained motion and smoother control than either a mouse or keyboard or joystick.

==Computer gaming technology==
===Hardware===
[[Image:Pc.computer.bristol.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|A typical PC has a mouse, keyboard, speakers, and a display screen]]
Virtually all personal computers use a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[computer mouse|mouse]] for user input, although other common gaming peripherals are a headset and microphone for faster communication with teammates or opponents in online games, joysticks for [[flight simulator]]s, and steering wheels for driving games.

Many computer games today place great emphasis on the processing power of the computer, requiring good performance from both the [[Cpu|CPU]] and [[graphics card]] in order to produce smooth gameplay in increasingly complex 3D games. As a result, gaming-related hardware is frequently improved upon to meet the demands of successive generations of games.

===Operating systems===
At present, computer games commonly require a specific [[operating system]] such as [[Microsoft Windows]] to function. While most games are developed for Windows,<ref name="windowsmarketshare">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/may2006/tc20060531_384873.htm |title= Apple Needs to Get Its Game On |accessdate=2006-09-23| last =Hesseldahl | first =Arik | date =2006-06-01}}</ref> [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]] versions of more popular titles usually become available through porting houses such as [[Aspyr]], or multi-platform developers such as [[Blizzard Entertainment]].

===Multiplayer===
====Local Area Network Gaming====
Multiplayer gaming was largely limited to [[Local Area Network]]s (LANs) before cost-effective [[broadband internet]] connections became available, due to their typically higher [[bandwidth]] and lower [[latency]] than the dialup services of the time. These advantages allowed more players to join any given computer game, but have persisted today because of the higher latency of most Internet connections and the costs associated with [[broadband internet]].

Typically, LAN Gaming requires two or more personal computers, a [[router]] and sufficient networking cables to connect every computer on the network. Additionally, each computer must have a [[Network Interface Card]] installed or integrated onto its motherboard in order to communicate with other computers on the network. Optionally, any LAN may include an external connection to the Internet.

====Online Multiplayer====
{{mainarticle|Online game}}
Online multiplayer games have achieved popularity largely as a result of increasing [[broadband internet|broadband]] adoption among consumers. Affordable high-bandwidth Internet connections allow large numbers of players to play together, and thus have found particular use in [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online RPGs]] and persistent online games such as [[World War II Online]].

Although it is possible to participate in online computer games using dial-up [[modem]]s, broadband internet connections are generally considered necessary in order to reduce the latency between players (commonly known as "lag"). Such connections require a broadband-compatible modem connected to the personal computer through a [[network interface card]] (generally integrated onto the computer's [[motherboard]]), optionally separated by a [[router]].

===Emulation===
{{main|Emulator}}
Emulation software, used to run software without the original hardware, have found some popularity for their ability to play legacy video games without the consoles or operating system for which they were designed. Console emulators, such as [[NESticle]] and [[MAME]], have become relatively commonplace in recent years. However, the complexity of modern consoles such as the [[Xbox]] makes them far more difficult to emulate, even for the original manufacturers.<ref name="xboxemulation">{{cite web| url = http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/xbox360_05.asp| title = Xbox 360 Review| accessdate = 2006-09-12| year = 2005| month = November}}</ref>

==Controversy==
[[Image:WoW-Lakeshire.png|thumb|right|Popular [[MMORPG]]s such as [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' have become the subject of criticism in recent years, amid concern that they encourage [[Game addiction|game addiction]].]]
{{main|Video game controversy}}
Computer games have long been a source of controversy, particularly related to the violence that has become commonly associated with video gaming in general. The debate surrounds the influence of objectionable content on the social development of [[minor]]s, with organisations such as the [[American Psychological Association]] concluding that video game violence increases childrens' aggression,<ref>{{cite web | author=[[American Psychological Association]] | url=http://www.psychologymatters.org/videogames.html | title= Violent Video Games - Psychologists Help Protect Children from Harmful Effects }}</ref> a concern that prompted a further investigation by the [[Center for Disease Control]] in September [[2006 in video gaming|2006]].<ref name="cvgaggressionresearch">{{cite web| url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060918-7771.html

Recently, another cultural aspect of video gaming has hit the media, namely [[Game addiction|video game addiction]]. Video game addiction can have a negative influence on health and on social relations, and has lead to deaths as a result of extremely prolonged gameplay.<ref name="addictiondeaths">{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4137782.stm
