==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:University of Houston in 1934.jpg|thumb|The University of Houston administrative offices at [[San Jacinto High School]] in 1934]] 
The University of Houston began as Houston Junior College (HJC).  On March 7, 1927, trustees of the [[Houston Independent School District]] [[Board of Education]] unanimously passed a resolution that authorized the founding and operating of a junior college.  The junior college was operated and controlled by the [[Houston Independent School District]] (HISD).<ref name="Handbook of Texas">{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/UU/kcu3.html |title=University of Houston<U+2013>University Park |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |work=Hand book of Texas |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref><ref name="Homecoming 2007 Timeline">{{cite web |url=http://www.advancement.uh.edu/homecoming/2007/timeline.htm |title=UH Timeline |publisher=University of Houston |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

Originally HJC was located in [[San Jacinto High School]] and offered only night courses.<ref name="UH Through Time: Events">{{cite web |url=http://info.lib.uh.edu/sca/digital/time/events.html |title=UH Through Time: Events |publisher=University of Houston Libraries |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>  Its first session began March 7, 1927, with an enrollment of 232 students and 12 faculty.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />  This session was primarily held to educate the future teachers of the junior college, and no freshmen were allowed to enroll.  A more accurate date for the official opening of HJC is September 19, 1927, when enrollment was opened to all persons having completed the necessary educational requirements.<ref name="Roarin 07">{{cite web |url=http://www.mycougarconnection.com/homecoming/history.htm |title=Discover UH's Heritage & History |publisher=UH Alumni Organization |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>  The first president of HJC was [[Edison E. Oberholtzer|Edison Ellsworth Oberholtzer]], who was the dominant force in establishing the [[junior college]].<ref name="Handbook of Texas" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/OO/fob2.html |work=Handbook of Texas |title=Oberholtzer, Edison, Ellsworth |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2008-04-06}}</ref>

===University beginnings===
The junior college became eligible to become a [[university|four-year institution]] in October 1933 when Governor [[Miriam A. Ferguson]] signed House Bill 194 into law.  On April 30, 1934, HISD's Board of Education adopted a resolution to make the school a four-year institution, and Houston Junior College became the University of Houston.<ref name="Roarin 07" />

[[Image:University of Houston in 1940.jpg|left|thumb|The University of Houston campus in 1940 at its present location]]
UH's first session as a four-year institution began June 4, 1934, at San Jacinto High School with an enrollment of 682. In 1934, the first campus of the University of Houston was established at the Second Baptist Church at Milam and McGowen.  The next fall, the campus was moved to the [[South Main Baptist Church]], on Main between Richmond and Eagle, where it stayed for the next five years.<ref name="Roarin 07" />

[[Image:Roy G. Cullen Memorial building preliminary drawing.jpg|thumb|A preliminary drawing of the [[Roy G. Cullen Memorial building]] by its architect in 1938]]
In 1936, philanthropists Julius Settegast and [[Ben Taub]] donated {{convert|110|acre|km2}} to the university for use as a permanent location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/first100/869592.html |title="Group of average students sparks UH creation" |date=2001-04-08 |accessdate=2008-04-06 |publisher=''[[Houston Chronicle]]''}}</ref> Two years later, [[Hugh Roy Cullen]] donated $335,000 for the first building to be built at the location.  The [[Roy G. Cullen Memorial Building|Roy Gustav Cullen Memorial Building]], was dedicated on June 4, 1939, and classes began the next day.  The first full semester of classes began officially on Wednesday, September 20, 1939.<ref name="Roarin 07" />

On March 12, 1945, Senate Bill 207 was signed into law, removing the control of the University of Houston from HISD and placing it into the hands of a board of regents.<ref name="Roarin 07" /> In 1945, the university, which had grown too large and complex for the Houston school board to administer, became a private university. In March 1947, the regents authorized creation of a law school at the university, initially designated as the Bates College of Law but later renamed the [[University of Houston Law Center]]. In 1949, the M. D. Anderson Foundation made a $1.5 million gift to UH for the construction of a dedicated library building on the campus. By 1950, the educational plant at UH consisted of 12 permanent buildings. Enrollment was more than 14,000 with a full-time faculty of more than 300.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />  By 1951, UH was the second-largest university in the State of Texas and was the fastest growing university in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,815555,00.html |title=Archangel in Houston |date=1951-10-15 |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref>

===State university===
[[Image:UH Religion Center.jpg|thumb|left|The [[A.D. Bruce]] Religion Center was named after the former President of UH]]
In 1953, the university established [[KUHT]], the first educational [[television]] station in the nation.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" /> During this period, however, the university as a private institution was facing financial troubles. Tuition failed to cover rising costs, and in turn, tuition increases caused a drop in enrollment. After a lengthy battle between supporters of the University of Houston, led by school president [[A.D. Bruce]],<ref name="txarchives">{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/uhua/00001/hua-00001.html |title=A.D. Bruce Speeches Collection, 1954-1961 |publisher=University of Texas Libraries |work=Texas Archival Resources Online (TARO) |accessdate=2007-06-25}}</ref> and forces from [[State university system|state universities]] geared to block the change, Senate Bill 2 was passed on May 23, 1961, enabling the university to enter the state system in 1963.<ref name="Handbook of Texas" />

In 1977, the [[University of Houston System]] was established, with the University of Houston named as the flagship institution of the system.<ref name="UH at a Glance" />  The University of Houston appended its official name to "University of Houston<U+2013>University Park" in April 1983.<ref name="University of Houston<U+2013>University Park">{{cite book|last=Adair|first=Wendy|title=The University of Houston: Our Time: Celebrating 75 Years of Learning and Leading|year=2001|publisher=Donning Company Publishers|location= |isbn=978-1-57864-143-7}}</ref> This name change was an effort by the University of Houston System to give its flagship institution a distinctive name that would eliminate confusion with the other three UHS universities. While these three universities ([[University of Houston<U+2013>Clear Lake|UH<U+2013>Clear Lake]], [[University of Houston<U+2013>Downtown|UH<U+2013>Downtown]], and [[University of Houston<U+2013>Victoria|UH<U+2013>Victoria]]) share the root name "University of Houston," they are essentially autonomous institutions, and each has its own president.  By August 1991, the flagship institution reverted to its original name of "University of Houston" after controversy and general resistance within the university community regarding the name change.<ref name="University of Houston<U+2013>University Park"/><ref name="University of Houston">{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/billlookup/History.aspx?LegSess=72R&Bill=SB755|title=72(R) History for Senate Bill 755|publisher=Texas Legislature|work=Texas Legislature Online History |accessdate=2010-03-28}}</ref>

===Merger of UH and UH System administrations===
[[Image:University of Houston Fall Enrollment.png|thumb|Fall enrollment trend at the University of Houston (1927-2007)]]
In 1997, the UH System and the University of Houston administrations merged into a single governing entity. Arthur K. Smith, then the UH president, became the first person to hold both the UH System chancellorship and University of Houston presidency simultaneously. Smith was responsible for overseeing the successful merger of the UH System and UH administrations, the launching of the "Learning. Leading." image campaign, the planning and construction of major buildings at all UH System institutions, a growth in external funding for research, and an increase in student enrollment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uh.edu/admin/media/newsroom/announcement/presidents1.html |title=University of Houston Presidents |publisher=University of Houston System |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

As of the merger in 1997, the University of Houston System administration is located in the [[Ezekiel W. Cullen Building]] on the University of Houston campus. On June 1, 2007, former UH President and Chancellor Dr. [[Jay Gogue]] left UH and UH System to become President of [[Auburn University]]. The University of Houston System Board of Regents appointed John M. Rudley, vice chancellor/vice president for administration and finance, to serve as Interim UH System Chancellor and Interim UH President.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uh.edu/admin/media/nr/2007/05may/051707johnrudleyinterimleader.html |title=John Rudley Named as Interim Leader of UH and UH System |publisher=University of Houston |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

The official colors of the University of Houston are scarlet red and albino white.  These were the colors of [[Sam Houston]]'s ancestor<U+2014>Sir Hugh<U+2014>and were adopted by UH at the same time as the official seal.  Scarlet red symbolizes courage or inner strength to face the unknown, and white symbolizes the goodness and purity of spirit embodied in helping one's fellow man.  The seal of the University of Houston, officially adopted in 1938, is a stylized version of the coat-of-arms of General [[Sam Houston]].  The first official version was placed on the floor of the [[Roy Gustav Cullen Building]].<ref name="Traditions">{{cite web |url=http://uhcougars.cstv.com/trads/hou-trads.html |title=University of Houston Traditions |publisher=UH Athletics |accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

The school's official mascot is a [[cougar]], which was adopted in 1947 and later named [[Shasta (mascot)|Shasta]].<ref>[http://uh.edu/about/history/index.php http://uh.edu/about/history/index.php]</ref> The university had a live cougar, but the tradition ended in 1989.

The [[Frontiersmen (University of Houston)|Frontiersmen]] are a group of students who participate in university events to drive school spirit.

===The Cougar Paw===
[[Image:UoHcougarpaw.png|thumb|95px|Graphic representation of The Cougar Paw]]
The Cougar Paw is a popular [[Manual communication|hand sign]] used by University of Houston students, faculty, alumni, and athletics fans to represent camaraderie and support.  The Cougar Paw tradition was adopted through several athletics events between the University of Houston and [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]]. The first time UH played UT in [[American football|football]] was in 1953, and since this was their first meeting, members of [[Alpha Phi Omega]], the service [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] in charge of taking care of [[Shasta (mascot)#Shasta I|Shasta I]], the university's [[mascot]], brought her to the game.  During the trip, Shasta's front paw was caught in the cage door and one toe was cut off.  At the game, members of the opposing team discovered what had happened and began taunting UH players by holding up their hands with the ring finger bent.  UT went on to win this game 28<U+2013>7, and UH students began using the sign as notice that they would remember the taunts.  In 1968, at their second meeting, the Cougars, holding up the now-adopted symbol of UH pride, played UT to a 20<U+2013>20 tie. UH did not play UT again until 1976, the first year UH was a member of the [[Southwest Conference]].  In front of a record crowd, UH defeated UT 30<U+2013>0.  This solidified the use of the Cougar Paw as a tradition.<ref name="Traditions" />
