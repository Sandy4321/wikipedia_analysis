{{AppleIntel}}

The '''Apple Intel transition''' was the process of changing the [[CPU]] of [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[computers]] from [[PowerPC]] processors to [[Intel]] [[x86]] processors. The transition began at the [[2005]] [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), when [[Apple Computer]] [[CEO]] [[Steve Jobs]] made the historic announcement that the company would transition from the use of PowerPC [[microprocessor]]s supplied by [[Freescale]] (formerly [[Motorola]]) and [[IBM]] in their Macintosh computers, to processors designed and manufactured by Intel, a chief supplier for most of Apple's competitors<ref>[[Apple Computer|Apple]] press release, [[June 6]], 2005:[http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html ''Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006'']</ref>. The new Macs run on [[Intel Core]] and [[Intel Xeon|Xeon]] x86 processors.

Apple's initial press release indicated the transition would begin by June 2006 and finish by the end of [[2007]], but it actually proceeded much more quickly. The first generation Intel-based Macintoshes were released in January 2006, and Steve Jobs announced the last models to switch in August 2006, with the [[Mac Pro]] available immediately and with the Intel [[Xserve]] available by October 2006.<ref>[http://macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/liveupdate/ "WWDC Live Keynote Update"]</ref>

==Precedents==
The Macintosh line underwent a similar transition between [[1994]] and about [[1996]], when Apple switched from Motorola's [[68K]] series of chips to [[IBM]]/Motorola [[PowerPC]] processors, developed jointly by Motorola,  Apple, and IBM. This took several years, during which Apple produced versions of the [[Mac OS]] that could run on either platform, introduced fairly low-level emulation of the 68K architecture by the PowerPC models, and encouraged third-party developers to release "[[fat binary|fat binaries]]" that could run natively on either architecture.

More recently, Apple has transitioned the Macintosh from the earlier [[Mac OS]] to [[Mac OS X]], a [[Unix-like]] operating system. This transition also took a number of years (a small percentage of older Macintoshes still run the earlier operating system), and was facilitated by the inclusion of [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], an environment in which an instance of [[Mac OS 9]] could be run, permitting the execution of programs that had not been ported to Mac OS X, as well as the introduction of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, allowing programs to run natively on either system.

A long-rumoured internal project within Apple (rumoured to be called "[[Fictional races in South Park#Marklar|Marklar]]"), was designed to ensure that builds of Mac OS X remained largely as [[cross-platform|portable]] as its predecessor [[NeXTSTEP]], so as to compile for both PowerPC and x86-class processors. Jobs confirmed this, stating that every version of OS X had in fact been compiled for Intel processors as well as PowerPC. It is not publicly known whether Apple maintains current builds for any other architectures. However, since it has recently been [http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197003973 confirmed] that at least three [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor cores are present in Apple's forthcoming [[iPhone]] product, it is strongly suspected an optimised version of OS X has been ported to the ARM architecture.

==Reasons==
Jobs stated that Apple's primary motivation for the transition was their disappointment with the progress of IBM's development of PowerPC technology, and their greater faith in Intel to meet Apple's needs. In particular, he cited the performance per watt (that is, the speed per unit of electrical power) projections in the [[Technology roadmapping|roadmap]] provided by Intel. This is an especially important consideration in laptop design affecting hours of use per battery charge.

In June 2003, Jobs had introduced Macintoshes based on the [[PowerPC 970|PowerPC G5]] processor and promised that within a year the [[clock speed]] of the part would be up to 3 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]. Two years later, 3&nbsp;GHz G5s were still not available, and rumours continued that IBM's low yields on the [[POWER4]]-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a [[laptop]] computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the [[personal computer]] industry. 

Some observers were surprised that Apple had not made a deal with [[AMD]], which has in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel, sometimes introducing technologies more quickly than the traditional industry leader. AMD's shorter track record and smaller production capacity, and Intel's significant [[brand]] awareness among the consumers and ability to also provide Apple with complete motherboard designs, have been offered as possible reasons for the choice of Intel. Also, as the laptop market was cited as a major reason for the switch, Intel was a more appropriate choice than AMD, as the [[Pentium M]] line of mobile chips has been proven to deliver better performance and lower heat than AMD's rival [[Turion 64]] chips{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

==Benefits of the move==
Advocates of the transition point out the potential for the new Intel Macintosh systems to run four classes of software at near native speeds: Mac OS X binaries, [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] applications, [[Unix]] applications, and potentially now [[Win32]]/x86 applications. No other hardware vendor can offer more than three of these.

Originally, [[emulation]] software such as [[DOSBox]] or [[Virtual PC]] was required in order to run x86 software on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] platform. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through [[virtualization]], such as is currently being done by [[Parallels Desktop for Mac]]. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a [[Dual boot|dual]], triple, or even quadruple boot solution would likely be possible on an x86 Apple device. Apple has already indicated they do not intend to take steps to prevent other operating systems being deployed on their new machines, and have subsequently released the [[Boot Camp]] software (including Windows drivers for Mac hardware) to facilitate setting up a dualboot system.

Although most games depend on the use of [[DirectX]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s not available on Mac OS X (on either processor type), it should be easier to port API-independent code now that developers no longer have to resolve [[endian]] issues associated with moving from x86 to PowerPC. Also developers no longer have to port x86 assembly to PowerPC.

==Hurdles associated with the move==
===Reaction to the change===
{{list to prose (section)}}
The announcement of Apple's intention to switch to Intel-based Macs was cause for concern with: 
* [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], the PowerPC dynamic translator, which, when first announced, only emulated a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] at 60-80% of a similar power CPU's clock speed;
* [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], the [[Mac OS 9]] virtualization for Mac OS X, cannot operate on the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator;
* the performance of Intel's [[chipset]]s;
* the x86 architecture itself, and whether it would affect system performance and application quality;
* issues of [[endianness]] (see [[endianness#Discussion.2C background.2C etymology|discussion, background, and etymology]]);
* reduced floating point performance in real world applications relative to equivalent or contemporary PowerPC processors;
* the possibility of Windows and Windows applications running natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it; 
* the early announcement of the change causing an [[Osborne effect]]; and
* the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the [[Intel Inside]] branding, which might be considered tasteless.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Many of these fears were put to rest at Macworld 2006 with the arrival of the first Intel-based Macs. 

* [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] was improved to offer much faster speeds than originally demonstrated (though benchmarks suggest that PowerPC code still does not perform as well under emulation on a Core Duo iMac as it does on a G5 iMac<ref>Anandtech, 30 January 2006: [http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2685 Apple Makes the Switch: iMac G5 vs. iMac Core Duo]</ref>).
* Intel's new Core Duo CPUs perform nearly as well as the most powerful [[Power Mac G5]] towers, and outperform the G5 chip in the 2005 model of iMac on both integer and floating point [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation|SPECmark]] tests.
* Limited compatibility with legacy Classic Mac Applications could be achieved by using emulators such as [[vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]] running on either Mac OS X or on Windows running on an Intel Mac.
* Applications native to both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser have been demonstrated to perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac.
* Fears of an [[Osborne effect]] were dismissed after sales of Macintosh computers for the Christmas 2005 quarter were higher than the previous Christmas.
* The Intel Inside branding did not appear on Intel-based Macs like the [[MacBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], [[iMac]], or [[Mac mini]].

===Viruses===
In some quarters there have been fears that the use of Intel processors would render the Macintosh vulnerable to Windows [[computer virus|viruses]]. Virus code is specific to the operating system or environment it affects, not merely the processor type. PowerPC processors enforce some restrictions on the alignment of executable code, which could make exploiting certain vulnerabilities less difficult on an Intel CPU, however most modern Intel chips offer similar security features. One possible loss of security that is fundamental to the architecture is that the return address is passed on the stack in x86, unlike PowerPC, which have a special Link Register to store the return address, which is only pushed on the stack if the procedure calls another procedure, which makes buffer-overflow attacks easier on x86, though Mac OS X supports the [[XD bit]] which make it harder to actually cause a buffer-overflow attack to execute code. Regardless of CPU architecture, a user on Mac OS X is by default granted a lower level of privilege than on [[Windows XP#Security issues|Windows XP]]. In the absence of a [[privilege escalation]] exploit, malicious software running under Mac OS X would only be able to damage files writable by a particular user, but not core system files. The same level of security is possible on Windows but it is much harder. Viruses that interact with the system at a very low level would also have to contend with a different system architecture, kernel, APIs and filesystem. Vectors of exposure such as [[ActiveX]] and [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]] should also not be a problem, since neither runs natively under Mac OS X. Vulnerabilities such as the [[Windows Metafile vulnerability|WMF problems]] in Windows would also not be directly applicable.

===Hardware-oriented===
There are questions over the extent to which Apple will retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some fear that Apple's [[industrial design]] philosophy may be affected if the company switches to non-Apple parts. Others note that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] Power Mac in 1995, and say that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image. 

The new Intel Macs employ a new Intel technology for [[firmware]], [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], not the [[Open Firmware]] Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC reliance on the [[BIOS]] while providing more functionality.<ref>[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/universal_binary_diffs/chapter_3_section_10.html Apple's transition documentation: Extensible Firmware Interface]</ref>

The use of the x86 architecture allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, and opens the possibility of using the [[Wine package]] to run Windows executables directly. Some fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since Mac OS X users can use a [[dual boot|dual-boot]] setup, or, perhaps, Wine, to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to [[Apple Switch ad campaign|switchers]], since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of Mac OS X being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X. It was previously thought that since XP is incompatible with the [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], it would not be run on Intel-based Macs.<ref>[[Engadget]], [[11 January]] 2006: [http://engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/ New Macs not XP friendly, but Vista is good to go]</ref>. Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest<ref name=onmac>Onmac.net, [[16th March]] 2006: [http://onmac.net/ Windows XP on an Intel Mac]</ref> resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that [[Windows Vista]] will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the latest version of Boot Camp allows Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac. 

Intel was seen among the Macintosh community as a purveyor of hot-running chips (especially the [[Pentium 4]]). Apple themselves mocked the Pentium range in their "Toasted Bunnies" advertisements of the late 1990s. However, the [[Pentium M]] chips, which were designed for laptop use, run much cooler than the Pentium 4. Apple claims the new Intel Core chips, which are based on the Pentium M microarchitecture, have dramatically better performance per watt than the PowerPC G4 and G5.

Finally, the relative quality of the x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of [[hardware register]]s compared to the PowerPC, and the lack of [[AltiVec]] (also known as [[Velocity Engine]]). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined [[RISC]] and [[CISC]] philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improvements to coming versions of [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] may equal [[AltiVec]], and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities now because the [[compiler]] does the work. 

The Core Solo and Core Duo chips are [[32-bit]] designs. On August 7, 2006, Apple released the [[Mac Pro]] and Intel-based [[XServe]], introducing Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of [[x86-64]]) architecture into the lineup through the use of the [[Xeon]] processor. Since then, all other computers in Apple's product line, with the exception of the Mac mini, have been updated with the 64-bit Core 2 Duo.

While the current benchmarks comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, The 64 bit edge will become more of an issue with the release of OS 10.5 (Leopard), and when users wish to dual boot Windows Vista in full 64 bit mode.

===Existing applications===
[[Image:Universal_Binary_Logo.png|thumb|right|125px|The Universal badge indicates software that will run at full speed on both PPC and Intel Macs.]] Java applications (that don't rely on [[Java Native Interface]]), [[Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]] [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]], and [[Scripting programming language|scripts]] that execute inside an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] all work immediately on both processors and are immune from changes. OS X applications that can't be migrated run inside a PowerPC [[Binary translation|dynamic translator]] on Intel called "[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]." Rosetta was originally limited to a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] instruction set, but now currently supports [[AltiVec]] and the [[PowerPC G4|G4]] instruction set, leaving only the [[PowerPC G5|G5]] additions unsupported. Rosetta is an instruction translator comparable to the 68K emulator that allows PowerPC Macintoshes to run pre-PowerPC code, rather than a virtual system like [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]]; it does not require a second operating system to be loaded as a subsystem before the application can work.

AltiVec itself has been encapsulated since [[Mac OS X v10.3|Mac OS 10.3]] by a vectorisation library; this library automatically selects between AltiVec on the PowerPC and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.

A new version of [[Xcode]] has been released that supports the generation of [[Universal Binaries]] for Intel and PowerPC, the new system's equivalent of the earlier 68K-PowerPC [[fat binary|fat binaries]]. [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] applications can be ported simply by recompiling them and checking for endian problems. [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] applications may require some additional tuning, but not of the complexity of the transition from Mac OS 9. Applications written using [[Metrowerks]] [[CodeWarrior]] suite will need to be modified; those which use [[PowerPlant]] will run after some code changes, described by Apple and Metrowerks. [[Metrowerks]] does not appear to have announced the future direction of its compiler suite after the transition, although it has sold its x86 Compiler/Debugger technology to "a third party."

[[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] will not be supported on the x86 architecture. This means that pre-Mac OS X software will not be able to run on Mac OS X out of the box, to which some users running older applications (such as [[QuarkXPress]] 4 and 5) have objected. (This also represents the first time in the history of the platform that applications dating from 1984<U+2019>s original 128k Mac have been unable to run on a stock Mac.) However, third-party emulators, such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], have been ported to Intel-based Macs, allowing some pre-Mac OS X software to run.
