These structures are found from [[Alaska]] to [[Greenland]]. This region, above the [[Arctic Circle]], is dominated by the [[tundra]] [[biome]] and has areas with few natural landmarks.

The inuksuk may have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting <ref name="ReferenceA">Charlotte Gray 'The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder' Random House, 2004</ref> or as a food cache.<ref>[http://www.athropolis.com/arctic-facts/fact-inuksuk.htm Inuksuit - Signposts of the North], Athropolis</ref> The Inupiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of [[Reindeer|caribou]] into contained areas for slaughter.<ref>[http://www.ethnobiology.org/conference/abstracts/pdfs/28th_abstracts.pdf 28 Ethnobiology Conference Abstracts]</ref> Varying in shape and size, the inuksuit have longtime roots in the Inuit culture.

Historically the most common type of inuksuk is a single stone positioned in an upright manner.<ref name=yennadon/> An inuksuk is often confused with an inunnguaq, a cairn representing a human figure. There is some debate as to whether the appearance of human- or cross-shaped cairns developed in the Inuit culture before the arrival of [[Europe]]an [[Missionary|missionaries]] and [[explorer]]s.<ref name=yennadon>[http://yennadon.sd42.ca/cyberschool/cyberdaysarchive2/logo/nationalpost.html "Inukshuk replacing the maple leaf as Canada's new symbol leads us ... somewhere"]</ref> The size of some innaguait suggest that the construction was often a communal effort.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

At [[Inuksuk Point|Enukso Point]] on [[Baffin Island]], there are over 100 inuksuit. The site was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inuksuk National Historic Site of Canada|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/det_E.asp?oqSID=0327&oqeName=Inuksuk&oqfName=Inuksuk|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pc.gc.ca/docs/r/system-reseau/sec6/sites-lieux74_e.asp National Historic Sites Of Canada System Plan]</ref>

== Name ==
[[File:Inuksugalait Foxe-PI 2002-07-26.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Inuksuit at the [[Foxe Peninsula]] ([[Baffin Island]]), Canada]]
The word ''inuksuk'' means "something which acts for or performs the function of a person". The word comes from the morphemes ''inuk'' ("person") and ''-suk'' ("[[ersatz]]" or "substitute"). It is pronounced ''inutsuk'' in [[Nunavik]] and the southern part of [[Baffin Island]] (see [[Inuit phonology]] for the linguistic reasons). In many of the central [[Nunavut]] dialects, it has the etymologically related name ''inuksugaq'' (plural: ''inuksugait'').

Despite the predominant English spelling as ''inukshuk'', both the Government of Nunavut<ref name=symbols>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.nu.ca/Nunavut/English/about/symbols.shtml|title=Symbols of Nunavut|publisher=Government of Nunavut|accessdate=2006-06-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060427062906/http://www.gov.nu.ca/Nunavut/English/about/symbols.shtml |archivedate = 2006-04-27}}</ref> and the [[Politics of Canada|Government of Canada]] through [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]<ref name=inac>{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ks/inukstrn_e.html|title=Transcript of Sharing a Story: The Inuksuk|publisher=[[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|accessdate=2006-06-13}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> are promoting the Inuit-preferred spelling ''inuksuk''.

A structure similar to an inuksuk but meant to represent a human figure, called an ''inunnguaq'' (''<U+1403><U+14C4><U+1673><U+140A><U+1585>'', "imitation of a person", plural ''inunnguat''), has become widely familiar to non-Inuit. However, it is not the most common type of inuksuk.  It is distinguished from inuksuit in general.

[[Hammer of Thor (monument)|The Hammer of Thor]], located on the [[Ungava Peninsula]], [[Quebec]] may be an inuksuk.

Inuksuit continue to serve as an Inuit cultural symbol. For example, an inuksuk is shown on the [[flag of Nunavut|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Nunavut|Coat of Arms]] of the [[Canada|Canadian]] territory of Nunavut, and the [[flag of Nunatsiavut]].  The [[high school]] in [[Iqaluit]] is named [[Inuksuk High School]] after the landmarks.

Inuksuit <U+2014> particularly, but not exclusively, of the inunnguaq variety <U+2014> also are increasingly serving as a mainstream Canadian [[national symbol]]. In 1999 Inukshuk was the name for the International Arctic Art & Music Project of [[ARBOS <U+2013> Company for Music and Theatre|ARBOS]] in the Canadian provinces of Qu<U+00E9>bec, Ontario, Nunavik, and Nunavut; and in Greenland, Austria, Denmark and Norway.<ref>''Inukshuk - The Arctic Art & Music Project of ARBOS'', edition selene, Vienna 1999. ISBN 3-85266-126-9</ref>

On July 13, 2005 Canadian military personnel erected an inuksuk on [[Hans Island]], along with a plaque and a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]], as part of Canada's longstanding dispute with [[Denmark]] over the small Arctic island.<ref>Press release from the Government of Canada, Foreign Affairs and International Trade. [http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:ZDN3uoDK-n0J:www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/canadaeuropa/Hans%2520Island%2520-%2520website.doc Google cache copy].</ref>  The markers have been erected throughout the country, including a nine-metre-high inuksuk that stands in [[Toronto]] on the shores of [[Lake Ontario]].  Located in Battery Park, it commemorates the [[World Youth Day 2002]] festival that was held in the city in July 2002.

Officials in various wilderness parks throughout Canada are routinely forced to dismantle inuksuit constructed by hikers and campers, for fear that they could misdirect park visitors from the cairns and other markers that indicate hiking trails. The practice of erecting inuksuit in parks has become so widespread that [[Killarney Provincial Park]], on the north shore of Ontario's [[Georgian Bay]], issued a notice in 2007 urging visitors to <U+201C>stop the invasion<U+201D> of inuksuit.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20070818.EINUKSHUK18/TPStory/Comment Of ego and inukshuks], [[Globe and Mail]]. August 17, 2007. Retrieved 2007-08-19.</ref> 

In some areas, including [[Northern Ontario]], individuals have built a large number of inuksuit along the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. In 2010, a journalist from [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]'s ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'' counted 93 inuksuit along [[Ontario Highway 69|Highway 69]] between Sudbury and [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]].<ref name=highway69>[http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2010/09/inukshuk230910.aspx "The Inukshukification of Highway 69"]. ''[[Northern Life (newspaper)|Northern Life]]'', September 22, 2010.</ref> The journalist successfully tracked down a person who had built two inuksuit along the route; he attributed his action to having had a "fill the dreams moment where I needed to stop and do it" while driving home from a family funeral.<ref name=highway69 />

[[File:2009-0605-Ilanaaq-2010Oly-Whistler.jpg|thumb|"Ilanaaq", the mascot logo of the 2010 Winter Olympics, located on [[Whistler Mountain]]]]

An inunnguaq is the basis of the logo of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] designed by [[Vancouver]] artist Elena Rivera MacGregor.  Its use in this context has been controversial, both among the Inuit and the [[First Nations]] of [[British Columbia]]. Although the design has been questioned, people believe it pays tribute to the inuksuk that stands at Vancouver's [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]].

This is a contemporary work created by artisan Alvin Kanak of [[Rankin Inlet]], [[Northwest Territories]] (which is now in the territory of Nunavut that separated from the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1999). It was given as a gift to the city for [[Expo 86]]. The land has since been donated to the city, and it is now a protected site. Friendship and the welcoming of the world are the meanings of both the English Bay structure and the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem.  Kanak's work represents the strength of his people and the modes of communication and technology before modern Canada.

The Vancouver 2010 logo and the construction of inuksuit around the world have led to increasing recognition of them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} There are five authentic inuksuit which were donated - wholly or in part - by the government of Canada: in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]; [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]]; [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]; [[Washington D.C.]], [[United States]]; and [[Guatemala City]].<ref>Green, Sarah. [http://torontosun.com/News/Canada/2007/11/02/4624880-sun.html "Inuit art finds home in Mexico"], ''Toronto Sun'', 2 Nov 2007, Retrieved 2007-11-08.</ref>

[[File:Inukshuk Monterrey 3.JPG|thumb|The Monterrey Inuksuk is unveiled by Canada's ambassador to Mexico and the governor of Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]]
The most recent Canadian-donated inuksuk was built in Monterrey in October 2007 by the renowned [[Inuvialuit]] artist [[Bill Nasogaluak]]. The sculpture was presented to the people of the northern state of [[Nuevo Le<U+00F3>n]] as a gift from the Monterrey chapter of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and the Government of Canada, to mark the chamber<U+2019>s 10th anniversary in the city. The sculpture stands over the [[Santa Luc<U+00ED>a Riverwalk]]. Nasogaluak, of [[Tuktoyaktuk]], personally chose the rocks for the structure from a local quarry near Monterrey. The inuksuk contains two rocks which the artist took to Mexico from Canada, one from the high Arctic and another from his home town of [[Toronto]]. Together they form the inuksuk<U+2019>s heart.

The inuksuk was also used as the symbol of the [[Summit of the Americas]],<ref>[http://summit-americas.org/SIRG/XLVI%20SIRG/Acta_ENG%2010-16-06.DOC Proceedings of the XLVI Meeting of the Summit Implementation Review Group (SIRG)]</ref> because of its connotations of friendship and cooperation.

On a commercial level, a local stone quarry built an inuksuk in [[Schomberg, Ontario]] as an attraction.<ref>[http://20minutesoffame.blogspot.com/2008/01/biggest-smallest-world-first-records.html "The Biggest, the Smallest: World Records and 20 Minutes of Fame"], 20 Minutes of Fame Blog, 7 Jan 2008</ref>  It is the largest in the world.<ref>[http://www.roadsideattractions.ca/schomberg.htm Large Canadian Roadside Attractions]</ref>
