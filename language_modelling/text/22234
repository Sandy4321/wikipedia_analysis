[[File:Finish line for the 2008 Great Lake Relay (Taupo, New Zealand).jpg|thumb|Finishing the 2008 Great Lake Relay]]

The '''Great Lake Relay''' is an annual team running event over approximately 160&nbsp;km. It is held at [[Taupo]], [[New Zealand]] on the third Saturday of February (not to be confused with the [[Great Lakes Relay]] held in Michigan in July). Each team consists of ten to eighteen members, either running or walking to complete the eighteen 4.7&nbsp;km to 14.4&nbsp;km legs around the largest lake in [[Australasia]], [[Lake Taupo]].
 
In 2009 this event, currently sponsored by [[New Balance]], will be held on Saturday 21 February, and will be celebrating the 14th running of the event which started back in 1995.

With over 5000 registered<ref>[http://www.relay.co.nz/documents/Glrwebentry08.pdf Registration Form]</ref> [[amateur]] and [[professional]] runners from all over Australasia taking part in the race each year, it is the biggest event of its type in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. While there are prizes awarded to the winners of the relay, and $150,000 worth of spot prizes given away, most of the runners take part just for the joy of [[team building]] and participating.
 
Following the prize giving, a post-race party is held in the Great Lake Centre, overlooking Lake Taupo, with plenty of drinks available.

===Qualifying===
The Great Lake Relay is open to all runners and walkers, both [[male]] and [[female]], of any age, ability and from any [[nation]]. For safety reasons however, the event is limited to the first 450 teams to complete an entry form, and pay the entry fee.

The [[Athletics New Zealand 100&nbsp;km Championships]], and the [[New Zealand 100 Mile Ultra Runners Road Championships]] are also incorporated into this event.<ref>Great lake relay entries flood in. (2002, January 21). ''Stuff.'' Retrieved, march 21, 2008 from Newztext database.</ref>
