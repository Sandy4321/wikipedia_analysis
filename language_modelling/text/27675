'''Route 88''' is a [[state highway]] in the northern part of [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It runs {{convert|10.02|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] and [[County Route 547 (New Jersey)|County Route 547]] in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood Township]] to an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 35|Route 35]] in [[Point Pleasant, New Jersey|Point Pleasant]]. It is a two-lane undivided road that passes through mostly residential and commercial areas. The route intersects [[County Route 549 (New Jersey)|County Route 549]] in Lakewood, [[New Jersey Route 70|Route 70]] in [[Brick Township, New Jersey|Brick Township]] at the former [[Laurelton Circle]], and [[County Route 549 Spur (New Jersey)|County Route 549 Spur]] in Point Pleasant. The road is mentioned in the lyrics of the 1973 song "[[Spirit in the Night]]" by [[Bruce Springsteen]].

The route was built as a gravel county road in 1903 and became part of [[Pre-1927 Route 4 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 4]], a route that was to run from [[Absecon, New Jersey|Absecon]] to [[Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway]], in 1916. U.S. Route 9 was designated along this stretch of road in 1926 when the [[U.S. Highway System]] was created. A year later, in 1927, this portion of pre-1927 Route 4 became a part of Route 35, a route that was to from Lakewood to [[South Amboy, New Jersey|South Amboy]]. By the 1940s, U.S. Route 9 was moved off this road to follow its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy. In 1953, Route 35 was realigned to follow a portion of [[New Jersey Route 37|Route 37]] between Point Pleasant and [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]], and Route 88 was designated along the former alignment of Route 35 between Lakewood and Point Pleasant. The Laurelton Circle at Route 70, built in 1937, was replaced with the current intersection by the 1990s.
