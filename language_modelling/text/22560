{{confused|Joe Dolan}}
''' Joseph "Galway Joe" Dolan''' (1942 &ndash; 7 January 2008) was an Irish [[musician]], song-writer and [[artist]].  Known as "Galway Joe" to distinguish him from [[Joe Dolan]] of [[Mullingar]], he was born in [[Galway]], [[County Galway]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Dolan was an arts student in [[Dublin]] before becoming involved in the [[Irish showband]]s of the 1960s, playing guitar with The Capitol Showband and The Swingtime Aces.<ref name="capp">{{cite web | url=http://www.irish-showbands.com/Bands/capitolf.htm | title=The Capitol Showband (1960-1972) | publisher=GMS Productions | work=Showbands | accessdate=23 June 2012}}</ref><ref name="send">{{cite book | title=Send 'Em Home Sweatin': The Showband Story | publisher=Mercier Press; Revised edition (31 December 2000) | author=Power, Vincent | location=Cork | isbn=978-1856353304}}</ref>

He is best known as one of the three founding members, together with [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] and [[Johnny Moynihan]], of the highly influential [[folk music|folk]] group [[Sweeney's Men]], which was formed in Galway in May 1966; Dolan also chose the group's name.  Sweeney's Men invigorated the Irish folk scene, and had an unexpected Irish top 10 hit with ''Old Maid in the Garret'' in 1967.<ref>''Irish Folk, Trad and Blues: A Secret History'', Colin Harper and Trevor Hodgett, 2005</ref>

He quit the band with the intention of travelling to [[Israel]], to take part in the [[Six-Day War]].  For many years afterwards he was presumed to have been killed in the fighting, but in fact never reached Israel at all; it was joked that Dolan had arrived on the seventh day. He then went on an archaeological expedition to the Negev desert.<ref>Joe Dolan, notes to Christy Moore's ''The Iron Behind the Velvet'', 2002</ref> He wrote "The Trip to Jerusalem" (recorded by [[Christy Moore]] in 1978 on ''[[The Iron Behind the Velvet]]'') Tara cat. no.

The Dubliners covered  "Nelson's Farewell", which was a hit in Ireland, and the trio Ardvarna released a beautiful version of "Mayfly Days".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/26/obituaries.mainsection1|title=Obituary - 'Galway' Joe Dolan|author=John Rabbetts|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 March 2008|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>

Dolan subsequently dropped professional music in favour of painting, but continued to compose robust, bitter-sweet songs, and would pass on [[cassette tape|tapes]] to anyone who was interested; he also continued to play in local sessions.

Dolan died of cancer in January 2008, survived by his son Andy and sister Chris.  His autobiography, ''Lost Miles and Broken Strings'', has not yet been published.
