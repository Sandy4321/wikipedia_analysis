'''Simeon Selby Pennewill''' ([[July 23]] [[1867]] &ndash; [[September 10]] [[1935]]) was an [[United States |American]] [[farmer]] and [[politician]] from [[Dover, Delaware |Dover]], in [[Kent County, Delaware |Kent County]], [[Delaware]]. He was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]], who served in the [[Delaware General Assembly]] and as [[Governor of Delaware]]. 

==Early life and family==
Pennewill was born [[July 23]] [[1867]] near [[Greenwood, Delaware |Greenwood]], [[Delaware]], son of Simeon & Ann Curry Pennewill. The elder Simeon was one of the larger peach growers and owned the land that later became the town of Greenwood. He was also active in the [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican Party]] and served in the Governor's Guard during the [[American Civil War |Civil War]]. Simeon, the younger, was educated at Wilmington Conference Academy, now [[Wesley College (Delaware)|Wesley College]] in [[Dover, Delaware |Dover]], and married later in life, after he served as Governor, first in 1920, Lydia Wright Elder, and second in 1927, Elizabeth Halsey. There were no children by either marriage. Pennewill inherited and continued to operate his family's peach orchards in [[Greenwood, Delaware |Greenwood]] and [[Bridgeville, Delaware |Bridgeville]], but lived at 228 North State Street in [[Dover, Delaware |Dover]]. He was a member of the [[United Methodist Church |Methodist Church]].

==Governor of Delaware==
Pennewill was elected to two terms in the [[Delaware State Senate]] and served from the 1899/1900 session through the 1905/06 session. In 1908 he was elected [[Governor of Delaware]] by defeating Rowland G. Paynter, the [[Democratic Party (United States) |Democratic Party]] candidate and served one term from [[January 19]] [[1909]] until [[January 21]] [[1913]]. Like his predecessor, Pennewill began his career as an Addicks [[Republican Party (United States) |Republican]], but was dedicated to reuniting the party.

This [[Delaware General Assembly |General Assembly]] at this time approved the sale of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] to the Federal government, and passed the Boulevard Corporation Act, which provided the legal authority for [[T. Coleman du Pont]] to begin to build his privately funded highway the length of the state. 

[[Delaware]]'s antiquated whipping post again received embarrassing national attention. Out of state pressure forced Pennewill to reduce the number of lashings given in one sentence, but the pressure seemed to only intensify local opinion in favor of the use of the whipping post. He also made the controversial appointment of his elder brother, James Pennewill, to the position of [[Chief Justice]] of [[Superior Court of Delaware |Delaware]]. He served until his death 26 years later in 1935. It was during Pennewill's term that the [[E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company |DuPont Company]] lost its anti trust suit and was forced to divest itself of what became the Hercules Powder and Atlas Powder Companies. 

==Death and legacy==
Pennewill died [[September 10]] [[1935]] at [[Dover, Delaware |Dover]] and is buried at the Bridgeville Methodist Cemetery, [[Bridgeville, Delaware |Bridgeville]], [[Delaware]].
