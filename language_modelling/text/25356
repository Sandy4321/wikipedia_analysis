'''Horace Greeley''' (February 3, 1811 &ndash; November 29, 1872) was an American [[newspaper editor]], a founder of the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]], a reformer, a politician, and an outspoken opponent of slavery. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' (which he founded and edited) was America's most influential newspaper from the 1840s to the 1870s and "established Greeley's reputation as the greatest editor of his day."<ref>Emery, Michael; Emery, Edwin, ''The Press and America'' (1988) 124-6.</ref> Greeley used it to promote the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] and [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican]] parties, as well as [[opposition to slavery]] and a host of reforms ranging from [[vegetarianism]] to [[socialism]].

Crusading against the corruption of [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s Republican administration, he was the new [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]'s candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 1872|1872 U.S. presidential election]]. Despite having the additional support of the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]], he lost in a landslide. He is the only presidential candidate to have died prior to the counting of electoral votes.

==Early life==
Greeley was born on February 3, 1811,<ref>Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 39. ISBN 0-86576-008-X</ref> in [[Amherst, New Hampshire]], the son of poor farmers Zaccheus and Mary Greeley.  He declined a scholarship to [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] and left school at the age of 14.  After serving as a printer's apprentice to Amos Bliss, editor of the ''Northern Spectator'', a newspaper in East Poultney, [[Vermont]], and working as a printer on the ''Erie Gazette'' in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], in 1831 he went to New York City to seek his fortune as an editor. Three years later, having worked as a printer for the ''Evening Post'' and several other newspapers, he had accumulated enough capital to launch a weekly literary and news journal, the ''New Yorker'', and, in 1840, a Whig campaign weekly, the ''Log Cabin''.

On July 5, 1836, Greeley married [[Mary Cheney Greeley]], an intermittent [[suffragette]], in [[Warrenton, North Carolina]]. Horace Greeley spent as little time as possible with his wife and would sleep in a boarding house when in New York City rather than be with her. Only two of their seven children survived into adulthood.

===Whig===
In 1838 leading Whig politicians selected him to edit a major national campaign newspaper, the ''Jeffersonian'', which reached 15,000 circulation. Whig leader [[William H. Seward|William Seward]] found him "rather unmindful of social usages, yet singularly clear, original, and decided, in his political views and theories".  In 1840 he edited a major campaign newspaper, the ''Log Cabin'' which reached 90,000 subscribers nationwide, and helped elect [[William Henry Harrison]] president on the Whig ticket. In 1841 he merged his papers into the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', which became known as the "Great Moral Organ." It soon was a success as the leading Whig paper in the metropolis; its weekly edition reached tens of thousands of subscribers across the country. Greeley was editor of the ''Tribune'' for the rest of his life, using it as a platform for advocacy of all his causes. As historian [[Allan Nevins]] explains:

{{quote|The Tribune set a new standard in American journalism by its combination of energy in news gathering with good taste, high moral standards, and intellectual appeal. Police reports, scandals, dubious medical advertisements, and flippant personalities were barred from its pages; the editorials were vigorous but usually temperate; the political news was the most exact in the city; book reviews and book-extracts were numerous; and as an inveterate lecturer Greeley gave generous space to lectures. The paper appealed to substantial and thoughtful people.|Nevins|''Dictionary of American Biography'' (1931)}}

Greeley prided himself in taking radical positions on all sorts of social issues; few readers followed his suggestions. [[Utopia]] fascinated him; influenced by [[Albert Brisbane]] he promoted [[Fourierism]]. His journal had [[Karl Marx]] (as well as [[Friedrich Engels]]) as European correspondent in the early 1850s (although most of his views sharply contrasted with the ones promoted by Marxism).<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/subject/newspapers/new-york-tribune.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2011}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=January 2011}} He promoted all sorts of agrarian reforms, including [[homestead principle|homestead laws]]. He was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the Thirtieth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the unseating of [[David S. Jackson]] and served from December 4, 1848&nbsp;&ndash; March 3, 1849, but failed in numerous other attempts to win elective office.

Greeley supported liberal policies towards settlers; in a July 13, 1865 editorial, he famously advised "Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country."  Some have claimed that the phrase was originally written by [[John Soule]] in the ''Terre Haute Express'' in 1851,<ref>[http://www.skagitriverjournal.com/US/Library/Newspapers/Greeley1-GoWest.html Skagit River Journal: ''"Go West , young man" Who wrote it? Greeley or Soule?'']</ref> but it is most often attributed to Greeley. Historian Walter A. McDougall quotes [[Josiah Bushnell Grinnell]], the founder of Iowa's [[Grinnell College]], as saying, "I was the young man to whom Greeley first said it, and I went." Researcher Fred R. Shapiro questions whether Greeley ever wrote it at all and cites, instead, an occurrence of Greeley writing "If any young man is about to commence the world, we say to him, publicly and privately, Go to the West" in the Aug. 25, 1838 issue of the newspaper ''New Yorker''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.llrx.com/features/quotedetective.htm

A champion of the working man, he attacked monopolies of all sorts and rejected land grants to railroads. Industry would make everyone rich, he insisted, as he promoted high tariffs. He supported vegetarianism, opposed liquor, and paid serious attention to any "-ism" anyone proposed. What made the ''Tribune'' such a success were the extensive news stories, very well written by brilliant reporters, together with feature articles by fine writers. He was an excellent judge of newsworthiness and quality of reporting. His editorials and news reports explaining the policies and candidates of the [[United States Whig Party|Whig Party]] were reprinted and discussed throughout the country. Many small newspapers relied heavily on the reporting and editorials of the ''Tribune''.

Greeley was noted for his eccentricities. His attire in even the hottest weather included a full-length coat, and he was never without an umbrella; his interests included spiritualism and [[phrenology]].<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h150.html www.u-s-history.com]</ref>

===Republican===
When the new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was founded in 1854, Greeley made the ''Tribune'' its unofficial national organ, and fought slavery extension and the slave power on many pages. On the eve of the Civil War, circulation nationwide approached 300,000. In [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860]] he supported the ex-Whig [[Edward Bates]] of Missouri for the Republican nomination for president, an action that weakened Greeley's old ally Seward.<ref>Van Deusen, Glyndon G. ''Horace Greeley, Nineteenth-Century Crusader'' (1953), 241<U+2013>244</ref>

Greeley made the ''Tribune'' the leading newspaper opposing the [[Slave Power]], that is, what he considered the conspiracy by slave owners to seize control of the federal government and block the progress of liberty. In the secession crisis of 1861 he took a hard line against the Confederacy.  Theoretically, he agreed, the South could declare independence; but in reality he said there was "a violent, unscrupulous, desperate minority, who have conspired to clutch power"&mdash;secession was an illegitimate conspiracy that had to be crushed by federal power. He took a [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] position during the war, in opposition to Lincoln<U+2019>s moderation.  In the summer of 1862, he wrote a famous editorial entitled "The Prayer of Twenty Millions" demanding a more aggressive attack on the Confederacy and faster emancipation of the slaves. One month later he hailed Lincoln<U+2019>s [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

Immediately after South Carolina's secession from the Union, President Abraham Lincoln had several possible plans of action. Greeley supported the stance of allowing the seceded states to "go in peace." Naturally, this view was unpopular among the vast majority of pro-Union Northerners. Lincoln's strong belief in preserving the Union led him to quickly disregard Greeley's idea.

Although after 1860 he increasingly lost control of the ''Tribune''<U+2019>s operations, and wrote fewer editorials, in 1864 he expressed defeatism regarding Lincoln<U+2019>s chances of reelection, an attitude that was echoed across the country when his editorials were reprinted. Oddly he also pursued a peace policy in 1863<U+2013>64 that involved discussions with [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] and opened the possibility of a compromise with the Confederacy. Lincoln was aghast, but outsmarted Greeley by appointing him to a peace commission he knew the Confederates would repudiate.

==Reconstruction==
In [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] he took an erratic course, mostly favoring the [[Radical Republicans|Radicals]] and opposing president [[Andrew Johnson]] in 1865<U+2013>66. In 1867 Greeley was one of 21 men who signed a $100,000 bond for the release of former president of the Confederacy [[Jefferson Davis]]. The move was controversial, and many Northerners thought Greeley a traitor and canceled subscriptions to the ''Weekly Tribune'' by the thousands.<ref>Turner, Hy B. ''When Giants Ruled: The Story of Park Row, New York's Great Newspaper Street''. New York: Fordham University Press, 1999: 79. ISBN 0-8232-1943-7</ref> In [[New York state election, 1869|1869]], he ran on the Republican ticket for [[New York State Comptroller]] but was defeated by the incumbent Democrat [[William F. Allen (New York)|William F. Allen]].

===Election of 1872===

[[Image:Greeley-Brown-1872.jpg|thumb|right|Greeley/Brown campaign poster]]
[[File:Nast vs Greeley.JPG|thumb|right|Greeley helps murder blacks in an 1872 [[Thomas Nast]] cartoon]]
After supporting [[Ulysses Grant]] in the 1868 election, Greeley broke from Grant and the Radicals. Opposing Grant's re-election bid, he joined the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] in 1872. To everyone<U+2019>s astonishment, that new party nominated Greeley as their [[U.S. presidential election, 1872|presidential candidate]]. Even more surprisingly, he was officially endorsed by the Democrats, whose party he had denounced for decades.

As a candidate, Greeley argued that the war was over, the Confederacy was destroyed, and slavery was dead&ndash;and that [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was a success, so it was time to pull Federal troops out of the South and let the people there run their own affairs. A weak campaigner, he was mercilessly ridiculed by the Republicans as a fool, an extremist, a turncoat, and a [[crank (person)|crank]] who could not be trusted. The most vicious attacks came in cartoons by [[Thomas Nast]] in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''. Greeley ultimately ran far behind Grant, winning only 43% of the vote.

This crushing defeat was not Greeley's only misfortune in 1872. Greeley was among several high-profile investors who were defrauded by [[Philip Arnold]] in a [[Diamond hoax of 1872|famous diamond and gemstone hoax]]. Meanwhile, as Greeley had been pursuing his political career, [[Whitelaw Reid]], owner of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', had gained control of the ''Tribune''.

===Death===
Not long after the election, Greeley's wife died. He descended into madness and died before the electoral votes could be cast. In his final illness, allegedly Greeley spotted Reid and cried out, "You son of a bitch, you stole my newspaper."<ref>Stephen L. Vaughn, ''Encyclopedia of American journalism'' (2008) p 204</ref>  Greeley died on Friday, November 29, 1872, in [[Pleasantville, New York]].  His death came before the Electoral College met. He would have received 66 electoral votes; they were scattered among others because of his death. However, three of Georgia's electoral votes were left blank in honor of him. (Other sources report Greeley receiving three electoral votes posthumously, with those votes being disallowed by Congress.)

Although Greeley had requested a simple funeral, his daughters ignored his wishes and arranged a grand affair. He is buried in New York's [[Green-Wood Cemetery]].

The [[Greeley House (Chappaqua, New York)|Greeley House]] in [[Chappaqua, New York]], now houses the New Castle Historical Society. [[Horace Greeley High School|The local high school]] is named for him. Paying homage to the 19th-century paper owned by Greeley, the high school named its newspaper the ''Greeley Tribune.''  The Greeley House was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>
