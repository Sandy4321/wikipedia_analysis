"'''Thinkin Bout You'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Frank Ocean]], released as the [[lead single]] from his debut [[studio album]] ''[[Channel Orange]]'' (2012). The song was written by Ocean and produced by [[Shea Taylor]]. Originally to be featured on [[Bridget Kelly]]'s debut album, Ocean released his original version of the track for free on his [[tumblr]] in 2011. In May 2012, the song was officially sent to radio and released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] as a single by Ocean. Kelly would later release her own version of the track entitled "Thinking Bout Forever".

Lyrically, the track is about a relationship just out of his reach and the turmoil that ensues. The track also explores feelings of regret and heartbreak. The song received highly positive reviews from [[music critics]], who praised the atmospheric production, Ocean's falsetto and writing ability. Some critics noted the possible [[bisexual]] undertones featured on the track.

In September 2012, the song peaked at position 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], 117 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], and 13 on the [[Heatseekers Songs]] chart. In 2011, the song received a music video directed by visual art group [[High5Collective]] released on September 15. Ocean appears in the violent clip revolving around an inter-dimensional love story and [[zombie]]s. Ocean performed the track during his seven-show tour through [[North America]] and [[Europe]] in November 2011, at the April 2012 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Musical Festival]], and his supporting tour for ''Channel Orange''. "Thinkin Bout You" has been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and has sold more than one million units in the United States. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in [[2013 Grammy Awards|2013]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

==Background==
In early 2011, [[Roc Nation]] recording artist [[Bridget Kelly]] and her production team had approached Ocean to write a song for her debut studio album.<ref name="rolling">{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/thinkin-bout-you-frank-ocean|title=Thinkin Bout You|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher= [[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|date=2011-12-07|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref><ref name="kelly"/> The song in question eventually became "Thinking About You", which Kelly commented; <U+201C>it<U+2019>s sort of a vulnerable track and I wanted everyone to feel me on it.<U+201D><ref name="rap">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/08/04/rap-up-tv-bridget-kelly-talks-roc-nation-debut-frank-ocean-jay-z/|title=Briget Kelly Talks Roc Nation debut|work=[[Rap-Up]] |publisher=Devin Lazerine|date= 2012-03-17|accessdate=2012-05-20}}</ref> On July 28, 2011, Ocean [[Internet leak|leaked]] his [[Demo (music)|demo]] version of the song onto his [[tumblr]] account, with the title stylized as "Thinking Bout You".<ref name="pitch1">Fitzmaurice, Larry (2011-07-28).

<blockquote>
"Now that push has come to shove, we're going to let the song have a life of its own. I think it's an amazing, well-written record.

==Reception==
"Thinkin Bout You" received highly positive reviews from [[music critics]]. [[Pitchfork Media]] called the song "bewitching" and complimented its crossover potential. [[Sputnikmusic]]'s Sobhi Youssef praised the track, commenting that Ocean's ability to "emote within the confines of a ballad without making it saccharine or cheesy is nearly unparalleled by any of his contemporaries", citing "Thinkin Bout You" as the framework of most of the album.<ref name="Youssef">{{cite web|last=Youssef|first=Sobhi|date=2012-07-15|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/review/50829/Frank-Ocean-Channel-Orange/|title=Frank Ocean - Channel Orange (staff review)|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]|accessdate=2012-07-15}}</ref> Pitchfork Media critic Jordan Sargant praised the song, and wrote "this isn't a tale of bedroom triumph; instead it's a beguiling sketch of a relationship just out of his reach.

John Calvert of the [[The Quietus]] described "Thinkin Bout You" as a "slow-release torch song the colour of caramel and bathed in low voltage lighting, a buzzing but soothing synth cycle and muffled beats evoke touching and kissing in a velveteen womb.

Hayley Louise Brown of ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' viewed the song as an important part of the album, musing "opening with a reworked version of heartbreaking ballad <U+2018>Thinking About You<U+2019> and an instant confrontation with the full force of Ocean<U+2019>s vocal range, the whole record echoes with extra terrestrial [[Odd Future]] synths and clumsy piano chords."<ref name="BrownHL">{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Hayley Louise|date=2012-07-13|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/frank-ocean-channel-orange|title=Frank Ocean - Channel Orange|journal=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|publisher=Clash Music|accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref> Lane Billings of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' noted the song as whispy in nature, and made a case for Ocean as an R&B revivalist.<ref name="Billings">{{cite journal|last=Billings|first=Lane|date=2012-07-13|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/07/frank-ocean-channel-orange.html|title=Frank Ocean: Channel Orange|journal=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|publisher=Paste Media Group|accessdate=2012-07-18}}</ref> [[Consequence of Sound]]'s Harley Brown of stated that the song moves languidly, "like perfect thoughts about someone missed, until the muscle memory of Ocean<U+2019>s falsetto bursts into the song<U+2019>s upper register."<ref name="BrownH"/> She continued, "while Ocean might feel this more acutely than either woman who sung those songs, there<U+2019>s a reason [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Bey]] shed a tear the first time she heard it.
