'''HMS ''Trafalgar''''' was one of two [[Trafalgar class battleship|''Trafalgar'' class battleships]], the other being [[HMS Nile (1888)|HMS ''Nile'']]. They were designed to be improved versions of the [[Admiral class battleship|Admiral]] and [[Victoria class battleship|''Victoria'']] classes, having a greater displacement to allow for improved protection.  However they sacrificed a full armoured belt for greater thickness amidships in a partial belt.

As originally designed, ''Trafalgar'' was to have displaced 11,940&nbsp;tons, and carried a secondary armament of ten guns of {{convert|5|in|mm}} calibre, disposed in the broadside battery. Changes made during construction however, led to an increase in displacement to 12,590&nbsp;tons; this led to the ships draught being increased by {{convert|12|in|mm}} from the initial design, and {{convert|18|in|mm}} with full bunkers. This in turn led to the main belt being immersed to a deeper level than had been intended, with a potential decrease in defensive effect in combat.

In October 1896 the secondary battery of {{convert|4.7|in|mm|sing=on}} guns was replaced by a more powerful battery of six {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} quick firers.

The main artillery, while situated at a militarily effective height of {{convert|14|ft|m}} above sea level, were only {{convert|42|in|mm}} above the deck. It was thought possible that firing along the keel line might cause structural damage; tests requested by the [[Director of Naval Construction|Chief Constructor]], however, showed the potential damage to be minimal.

As compared to [[HMS Sans Pareil (1887)|HMS ''Sans Pareil'']] the under-water hull form was finer, with a larger rudder. together with the reduced freeboard as compared to earlier ships this had a significantly adverse effect on her handling; as she spent her active service in relatively calm water in the Mediterranean, this defect was of minimal importance.

==Service history==
She was completed, except for her main armament, in only three years and three months. The delay in the production of her guns meant that she was not commissioned, as second flagship [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] until 2 April 1890. She served in this position until October 1897, when she paid off at [[Portsmouth]], and where she remained as guardship until August 1902. She remained thereafter in reserve until 1907, when she went to [[Sheerness]] to serve as a drill ship for crews of turrets and of submerged torpdo tubes. In April 1909 she reverted to active service with the fourth division of the [[Home Fleet]], based at [[the Nore]]. She was sold on 9 March 1911.
