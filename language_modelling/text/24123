The '''Indian Reserve''' is a historical term for a largely uncolonized area in North America ceded by France to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] following the [[French and Indian War]], set aside in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]]<ref> [http://originaldocuments.ca/documents/RoyalProc11763Oct7| Royal Proclamation]</ref> for use by [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]], who already inhabited it.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colin Gordon Calloway|title=The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XtxG369-VHQC&pg=PA99|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=99}}</ref>

In present-day United States, it consisted of all the territory north of Florida and New Orleans that was east of the [[Mississippi River]] and west of the [[Eastern Continental Divide]] in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] that formerly comprised the eastern half of [[Louisiana (New France)]]. In modern Canada, it consisted of all the land immediately north of the [[Great Lakes]] but south of [[Rupert's Land]] belonging to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], as well as a buffer between the [[Province of Quebec (1763<U+2013>1791)]] and Rupert's Land stretching from [[Lake Nipissing]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

Most of the ceded territory had been claimed earlier by [[Early modern France|France]], but the claim was ceded in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] that ended the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]]. In the Proclamation of 1763, [[George III]] organized on paper much of the new territorial gains in three colonies in North America<U+2014>[[East Florida]], [[West Florida]], and Quebec. The rest of the expanded British territory was left to American Indians. The delineation of the Eastern Divide, following the Allegheny Ridge of the Appalachians, confirmed the limit to British settlement established at the 1758 [[Treaty of Easton]], before [[Pontiac's War]].

According to the royal proclamation, all European settlers in the territory (who were mostly French) were supposed to leave the territory or get official permission to stay. Many of the settlers moved to New Orleans and the French land on the west side of the Mississippi (particularly [[St. Louis]]), which in turn had been ceded secretly to Spain to become [[Louisiana (New Spain)]]. However, many of the settlers remained and the British did not actively attempt to evict them.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

In 1768, lands west of the Alleghenies and south of the Ohio were ceded to the colonies by the Cherokee at the [[Treaty of Hard Labour]] and by the Six Nations at the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]]. However, several other Indian nations, particularly Shawnee and Mingo, continued to inhabit and claim their lands that had been sold to the British by other tribes. This conflict led to [[Dunmore's War]] in 1774, ended by the Treaty of Camp Charlotte where these tribes agreed to accept the Ohio River as the new boundary. 

Restrictions on settlement were to become a flash point in the [[American Revolutionary War]], following the [[Henderson Purchase]] of much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in 1775. The renegade Cherokee chief [[Dragging Canoe]] did not agree to the sale, nor did the Royal Government in London, which forbade settlement in this region. As an act of Revolution in defiance of the crown, white pioneer settlers began pouring into Kentucky in 1776, opposed by Dragging Canoe in the [[Chickamauga Wars]], which continued until 1794.
