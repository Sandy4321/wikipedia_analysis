The '''Common Tailorbird''' (''Orthotomus sutorius'') is a [[songbird]] found across tropical Asia. Popular for its nest made of leaves "sewn" together and immortalized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in his ''[[Jungle Book]]'', it is a common resident in urban gardens. Although shy birds that are usually hidden within vegetation, their loud calls are familiar and give away their presence. They are distinctive in having a greenish upper body plumage, long upright tail and the rust coloured forehead and crown. This [[passerine]] [[bird]] is typically found in open farmland, scrub, forest edges and gardens.  Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider silk to make a cradle in which the actual nest is built.

Like most warblers, the Common Tailorbird is [[insectivorous]]. The song is a loud ''cheeup-cheeup-cheeup'' with variations across the populations. The disyllabic calls are repeated often.<ref name=pcr/>

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The scientific name ''sutorius'' means "cobbler" rather than "tailor" while ''Orthotomus'' means "straight-cutting".<ref>{{cite book|year=1909|pages=62<U+2013>67|title=Birds of the plains|author=Dewar, Douglas|publisher=John Lane|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/birdsofplainsdew00dewarich#page/62/mode/2up}}</ref><ref name=wood/>

The species was earlier placed in the family [[Sylviidae]] but more recent molecular studies place the species within the family Cisticolidae, along with ''[[Prinia]]'' and ''[[Cisticola]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Phylogeny and classification of the avian superfamily Sylvioidea|author= Alstr<U+00F6>m, Per; Ericson, PG; Urban Olsson & Per Sundberg|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |year=2006|pages=381<U+2013>397|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.05.015 |url=http://www.nrm.se/download/18.4e1d3ca810c24ddc70380001143/Alstr%C3%B6m+et+al+Sylvioidea+MPEV+2006.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=16054402|issue=2}}</ref>

A number of subspecies are recognized within its widespread range in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The nominate race is from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Race ''fernandonis'' is found in the highlands of Sri Lanka. Neighbouring India has ''guzuratus'' in the peninsula and west to Pakistan while towards the north ''patia'' is found in the Terai of Nepal along the Himalayan foothills until Myanmar. A small population of ''patia'' is also found in the northern Eastern Ghats (Wangasara).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ripley,S Dillon; Beehler,Bruce M; Raju,KSR Krishna |year=1988| title= Birds of the Visakhapatnam Ghats, Andhra Pradesh-2|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume=85| issue=1| pages=90<U+2013>107}}</ref> The hills of northeastern India have ''luteus''. In Southeast Asia ''inexpectatus'' and ''maculicollis'' are found in Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. The islands of Hainan, Tonkin have ''longicauda'' while ''edela'' is found on Java. 
==Description==
[[File:TailorBird.ogg|thumb|left|Calls of ''guzuratus'' from southern India]]
The Common Tailorbird is a brightly coloured bird, with bright green upperparts and whitish underparts. They range in size from {{convert|10|<U+2013>|14|cm|in}}  and weigh {{convert|6|<U+2013>|10|g|oz}}. They have short rounded wings, a long tail, strong legs and a sharp bill with curved tip to the upper mandible. They are [[wren]]-like with a long upright tail that is often moved around. The crown is rufous and the upperparts are predominantly olive green. The underside is creamy white. The sexes are identical, except that the male has long central tail [[feather]]s in the breeding season. (The reliability of sexing of specimens in determining this difference has been questioned by [[Hugh Whistler]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ali,Salim; Whistler,Hugh |year=1939| title= The birds of Central India. Part I.| journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.| volume=41|issue=1|pages=82<U+2013>106}}</ref>) Young birds are duller.<ref name=pcr/> When calling the dark patches on the sides of the neck become visible.<ref>{{cite journal|pages=94<U+2013>115|author=Cave, WA | title= The Birds of Colombo|journal=Spolia Zeylanica|volume=8|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/spoliazeylanica08nati#page/96/mode/2up}}</ref> These are due to the dark pigmented and bare skin that are present in both sexes and sometimes give the appearance of a dark gorget.<ref name=hbk>{{cite book|author=Ali, S & S D Ripley| title=Handbook of the birds of India and Pakistan|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume= 8|year= 1997 |pages =78<U+2013>84 }}</ref> 
==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Common Tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius) gleaning insects from Kapok (Ceiba pentandra) flower buds in Kolkata W IMG 3802.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Foraging for insects]]
Tailorbirds are found in singly or in pairs, usually low in the undergrowth or trees sometimes hopping on the ground. They forage for insets and have been known to feed on a range of beetles and [[hemiptera|bugs]]. They are attracted to insects at flowers and are known to favour the inflorescenses of mango. They are known to visit the flowers of ''Bombak'', ''Salmalia'' and other large flowers for nectar and get covered on the head and throat with pollen, giving them a golden-headed appearance.<ref name=hbk>{{cite book|author=Ali, S & S.D. Ripley|year=1997| title=Handbook of the Birds of India and Pakistan. Volume 8|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=New Delhi|pages=78<U+2013>84}}</ref>

The birds roost alone during the non-breeding season but may roost side-by-side during the breeding season, sometimes with the newly fledged juvenile sandwiched between the adults. The roost sites chosen are thin twigs on trees with cover above them and were often close to human habitation and lights.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Roosting behaviour of common tailorbird ''Orthotomus sutorius'' (Pennant)|author= Andheria, A. P. |journal=J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. |year=2002| volume=99 |part=2|pages=312<U+2013>315}}</ref>

===Breeding===
[[Image:Common Tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius) Nest in Hyderabad, AP W IMG 7248.jpg|thumb|upright|Nest from India]]
The breeding season is March to December peaking from June to August in India, coinciding with the wet season. In Sri Lanka the main breeding season is March to May and August to September, although they do breed throughout the year.<ref name=pcr>{{cite book|author=Rasmussen PC & JC Anderton|year=2005| title = Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide. Vol. 2|publisher=Smithsonian Institution & Lynx Edicions|page=477}}</ref> Although the name is derived from the nest, the nest is not unique and similar nests are also found in many ''[[Prinia]]'' warblers. The nest is a deep, soft cup lined with soft materials and is placed in thick foliage and the leaves used to hold the nest have the upper surfaces outwards so that the nest is difficult to spot. The punctures made on the edge of the leaves are minute and do not cause browning of the leaves, further aiding camouflage. The nest lining of a nest in Sri Lanka that was studied by Casey Wood was found to be lined with lint from ''Euphorbia'', ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'' and ''[[Bombax malabaricum]]'' species. [[Thomas C. Jerdon|Jerdon]] had noted that the bird made knots, however no knots have been described by subsequent observers. Wood classified the processes used by the tailorbird in nest as sewing, rivetting, lacing and matting. In some cases the nest is made from a single large leaf; the margins of which are rivetted together. Sometimes the fibres from one rivet are extended into an adjoining puncture and appearing more like sewing.<ref name=wood>{{cite book|year=1925|publisher=Smithsonian Report|author=Wood, Casey A. |title=The nest of the Indian tailor bird |pages=349<U+2013>354|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/annualreportofbo1925smit#page/n387/mode/2up}}</ref> The stitch is made by piercing two leaves and drawing fibre through them. The fibres fluff out on the outside and in effect they are more like rivets.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Neelakantan,KK |year=1976|title= On some nests of the Tailor Bird (''Orthotomus sutorius'')|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.|volume=73|issue=2|pages=396<U+2013>400}}</ref> There are many variations in the nest and some may altogether lack the cradle of leaves. One observer noted that the birds did not utilize cotton that was made available<ref>{{cite journal|author=Briggs,FS |year=1929|title= A note on the breeding of the Tailor Bird ''Orthotomus sutorius''|journal= J. Bombay Nat. Hist.

The incubation period is about 12 days. Both male and female feed the young. Mortality of eggs and chicks are high due to predation by rodents, cats, crow-pheasants, lizards and other predators.<ref name=hbk/> The incubation period is about 12<U+2013>14 days and the young birds fledge in about 14 days. The female alone incubates according to some sources, while others suggest that both sexes incubate but both parents take part in feeding and sanitation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Neelakantan,KK|year=1976 |title= On a nesting pair of Tailor Birds (''Orthotomus sutorius'')|journal=J.

==In culture==
[[Rudyard Kipling]] in [[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]], one of his Jungle Book stories, includes a tailorbird couple, ''Darzee'' (which means "tailor" in Urdu) and his wife, as two of the key characters.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/birdsofcalcutta00finnrich#page/34/mode/2up |pages=34<U+2013>38|title=Birds of Calcutta|author=Finn, Frank|year=1904|publisher=Thacker, Spink & Co}}</ref> Darzee's wife is said to have feigned injury, but this behaviour is unknown in this species.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Injury-Feigning in Nesting Birds|author=Swarth, Harry S. |journal=The Auk|volume=52|issue=3|year=1935|pages=352<U+2013>354}}</ref> The local names of the bird in India include ''phutki'' (Hindi) and ''tuntuni'' (Bengali).<ref>{{cite book|title=Garden and aviary birds of India|edition=2|author=Finn, Frank| year=1915|publisher=Thacker, Spink & co.|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/birdgardenaviary00finnrich#page/34/mode/2up|page=35}}</ref> A classic book of children's folk tales in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] by [[Upendrakishore Ray]] is titled "Tuntunir Boi".
