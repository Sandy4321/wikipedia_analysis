[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] '''Robert Falcon Scott''' [[Commander of the Royal Victorian Order|CVO]] (6 June 1868 <U+2013> 29 March 1912) was a [[Royal Navy]] officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the [[Antarctic]] regions: the [[Discovery Expedition]], 1901&ndash;04, and the ill-fated [[Terra Nova Expedition]], 1910&ndash;13. During this second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the [[South Pole]] on 17 January 1912, only to find that they had been preceded by [[Roald Amundsen]]'s Norwegian expedition. On their return journey, Scott and his four comrades all perished from a combination of exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold.

Before his appointment to lead the Discovery Expedition, Scott had followed the conventional career of a naval officer in peacetime Victorian Britain, where opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. It was the chance for personal distinction that led Scott to apply for the [[RSS Discovery|''Discovery'']] command, rather than any predilection for polar exploration.<ref>Crane, p. 84</ref> However, having taken this step, his name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final twelve years of his life.

Following the news of his death, Scott became an iconic British hero, a status maintained for more than 50&nbsp;years and reflected by the many permanent memorials erected across the nation. In the closing decades of the 20th century, however, in a more sceptical age, the legend was reassessed as attention focused on the causes of the disaster that ended his and his comrades' lives, and the extent of Scott's personal [[culpability]].  From a previously unassailable position, Scott became a figure of controversy, with questions raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have on the whole regarded Scott more positively, emphasising his personal bravery and stoicism while acknowledging his errors, but ascribing his expedition's fate primarily to misfortune.

==Early life==
===Family background===
Scott was born on 6 June 1868, the third child  and elder son of John Edward and Hannah (n<U+00E9>e Cuming) Scott of [[Stoke Damerel]], near [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]], [[Devon]]. Although his father was a brewer and magistrate, there were naval and military traditions in the family, Scott's grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy.<ref>Crane, p. 14&ndash;15</ref> John Scott's prosperity came from the ownership of a small [[Plymouth]] brewery which he inherited from his father and which he subsequently sold.<ref>Crane, p. 22</ref> In later years, when Scott was establishing his naval career, the family would suffer serious financial misfortune, but his early childhood years were spent in comfort.

In accordance with the family's tradition, Robert and his younger brother Archibald were predestined for careers in the armed services. Robert spent four years at a local day school before being sent to [[Stubbington House School]], [[Hampshire]], a [[cram school|cramming establishment]] preparing candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship [[HMS Britannia (1820)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]]. Having passed these exams Scott, aged 13, began his naval career in 1881, as a cadet.<ref>Fiennes, p. 17</ref>

===Early naval career===
[[Image:HMS Britannia Chambers mg 0529.jpg|thumb|alt= Rear view of large wooden ship, tall-masted and in full sail. Smaller vessels are in attendance.|The first of the two HMS ''Britannias'' which served as naval training ships between 1859 and 1909. Scott trained on the second, which came into service in 1869.]]

In July 1883, Scott passed out of ''Britannia'' as a [[midshipman]], seventh overall in a class of 26.<ref name = "Crane_23&ndash;24">Crane, p. 23</ref> By October, he was en route to South Africa to join {{HMS|Boadicea|1875|6}}, the flagship of the Cape squadron, the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years. While stationed in [[St Kitts]], [[West Indies]], on {{HMS|Rover|1874|6}}, he had his first encounter with [[Clements Markham]], then Secretary of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS), who would loom large in Scott's later career. On this occasion, 1 March 1887, Markham observed Midshipman Scott's cutter winning that morning's race across the bay.  Markham's habit was to "collect" likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future. He was impressed by Scott's intelligence, enthusiasm and charm, and the 18-year-old midshipman was duly noted.<ref name ="Crane_82">Crane, p. 82</ref>

In March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for [[Sub-Lieutenant]], with four First Class certificates out of five.<ref>Crane, p. 34</ref>  His career progressed smoothly, with service on various ships and promotion to [[Lieutenant]] in 1889. In 1891, after a long spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on [[HMS Vernon (shore establishment)|HMS ''Vernon'']], an important career step. He graduated with First Class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.<ref>Crane, p.50</ref>

During the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen,<ref>''Scott and Amundsen'', later republished as ''The Last Place On Earth''. See '''Sources''' section.</ref> polar historian [[Roland Huntford]] investigated a possible scandal in Scott's early naval career, related to the period 1889&ndash;90 when Scott was a lieutenant on {{HMS|Amphion|1883|6}}. According to Huntford, Scott "disappears from naval records" for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 24 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, of cover-up, and protection from senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further.  He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.<ref>Huntford, pp. 121&ndash;23, and Crane, footnote pp. 39&ndash;40</ref>

In 1894, while serving as Torpedo Officer on the depot ship {{HMS|Vulcan|1889|6}}, Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt.<ref name ="Fiennes_21&ndash;23">Fiennes, p. 21</ref> At the age of 63, and in poor health, he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to [[Shepton Mallet]], [[Somerset]].  Three years later, while  Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship [[HMS Majestic (1895)|HMS ''Majestic'']], John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis.<ref name ="Fiennes_21&ndash;23">Fiennes, p. 22</ref>  Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters  now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting typhoid fever, meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.<ref name ="Fiennes_21&ndash;23">Fiennes, p. 23</ref>

Promotion, and the extra income this would bring, now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott.<ref>Crane, p. 59</ref> Early in June 1899, while home on leave, he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham (now knighted and RGS President), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society. It was an opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.<ref name ="Crane_82">Crane, p. 82</ref>

==Discovery Expedition 1901<U+2013>1904==
{{Main| Discovery Expedition}}

The British National Antarctic Expedition, later known as the Discovery Expedition, was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the [[Royal Society]].  A long-cherished dream of Markham's,  it required  all of his  skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott may not have been Markham's first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man's support remained constant.<ref>Crane, p. 90</ref> There were committee battles over the scope of Scott's responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition's programme while Scott merely commanded the ship. Eventually, however, Markham's view prevailed;<ref>Preston. pp. 28<U+2013>29</ref> Scott was given overall command, and was promoted to the rank of [[Commander]]<ref>Crane, p. 63</ref> before ''Discovery'' sailed for the Antarctic on 31 July 1901.

Although experience  of Antarctic or Arctic waters was almost entirely lacking within the 50-strong party, there was very little special training in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail.<ref>Scott, ''Voyage of the Discovery'' Vol I p. 170:  "Our ignorance was deplorable"</ref>  Dogs were taken, as were skis, but hardly anyone knew how to use them. In Markham's view, professionalism was considered less praiseworthy than "unforced aptitude",<ref>Huntford, ''Shackleton'' biography, p. 134</ref> and possibly Scott was influenced by Markham's belief. In the first of the two full years which ''Discovery'' spent in the ice, this insouciance was severely tested, as the expedition struggled to meet the challenges of the unfamiliar terrain. An early attempt at ice travel resulted in the death of  George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 4 February 1902.<ref>Crane, pp. 161&ndash;167</ref> 
[[Image:Scott hut mcmurdo.jpg|thumb|alt= Wooden structure with door and two small windows. To the left is an open lean-to. In the background are partly snow-covered mountains.|The ''Discovery'' hut at [[Hut Point]]]]

The expedition had both scientific and  exploration objectives; the latter included a long journey south, in the direction of the South Pole.  This march, undertaken by Scott, [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]],  took them to a latitude of 82<U+00B0>17'S, about {{convert|530|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the pole.  A harrowing return journey brought about Shackleton's physical collapse and his early departure from the expedition.<ref>Preston, p. 60&ndash;67</ref>The second year showed improvements in technique and achievement, culminating in Scott's western journey which led to the discovery of the [[Polar Plateau]]. This has been described by one writer as "one of the great polar journeys".<ref>Crane, p. 270</ref> The scientific results of the expedition included important biological, zoological and geological findings.<ref>Fiennes, p. 148</ref>  Some of the meteorological and magnetic readings, however, were later criticised as amateurish and inaccurate.<ref>Huntford, pp. 229&ndash;30, Crane, pp. 392&ndash;93</ref>

At the end of the expedition it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free ''Discovery'' from the ice.<ref>Preston, pp. 78&ndash;79</ref>  Afterwards, Scott remained unconvinced that dogs and ski were the keys to efficient ice travel. In the following years he continued to express the British preference for [[manhauling|man-hauling]] (the practice of propelling sledges by manpower, unassisted by animals),<ref>Jones, p. 71, quoting from ''The Voyage of the Discovery''</ref> a view he maintained until very late in his Antarctic career. His insistence during the expedition on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command [[Albert Armitage]], a merchant officer, was  offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused.<ref>Preston, pp. 67&ndash;68</ref>  Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown.<ref>Crane, pp. 240<U+2013>41</ref>  Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were  preserved;<ref>Crane, p. 310</ref> Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the [[Nimrod Expedition]],<ref>Crane, p. 396&ndash;97</ref> and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909&ndash;10.<ref name="Preston, p. 113">Preston, p. 113</ref>

==Between expeditions==
===Popular hero===
''Discovery'' returned to Britain in September 1904. The expedition had caught the public imagination, and Scott became a popular hero. He was awarded  a cluster of honours and medals, including many from overseas, and was  promoted to the rank of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]]<ref>Crane, p. 309</ref> He was  invited to [[Balmoral Castle]], where [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] created him a Commander of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] (CVO).<ref>Preston, pp. 83&ndash;84</ref>

Scott's next few years were crowded. For more than a year he was occupied with public receptions, lectures and the writing of the expedition record, ''The Voyage of the Discovery''. In January 1906, he resumed his full-time naval career, first as assistant to the Director of [[Naval Intelligence]] at the [[Admiralty]] and, in August, as [[Flag-Captain]] to Rear-Admiral Sir George Egerton on [[HMS Victorious (1895)|HMS ''Victorious'']].<ref>Preston, p. 86</ref> He was now moving in ever more exalted social circles <U+2013> a telegram to Markham in February 1907 refers to meetings with the Queen and Crown Prince of Portugal, and a later letter home reports lunching with the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet and [[Prince Heinrich of Prussia]].<ref>Crane, p. 334. The telegram related to a collision involving Scott's ship, [[HMS Albemarle (1901)|HMS ''Albemarle'']]. Scott was cleared of blame.</ref>

===Dispute with Shackleton===

By early 1906, Scott had sounded out the RGS about the possible funding of a future Antarctic expedition.<ref>Preston, p. 87</ref>  It was therefore unwelcome news to him that [[Ernest Shackleton]] had announced his own plans to travel to ''Discovery''{{'}}s old [[McMurdo Sound]] base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there.<ref>Shackleton publicly announced his plans to the RGS on 7 February 1907. Scott had enjoined RGS Secretary Keltie to secrecy about his own intentions. Crane, p. 335</ref> Scott claimed, in the first of a series of letters to Shackleton, that the area around McMurdo was his own "field of work" to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up, and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area.<ref name ="Crane_335-341">Crane, p. 335</ref>  In this, he was strongly supported by ''Discovery''{{'}}s former zoologist, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], who asserted that Scott's rights extended to the entire [[Ross Sea]] sector.<ref name = "Riffenburgh_110-18">Riffenburgh, pp. 113&ndash;14</ref>   This Shackleton refused to concede. Finally, to end the impasse, Shackleton agreed, in a letter to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170<U+00B0>W meridian and therefore to avoid all the familiar ''Discovery'' ground.<ref name = "Crane_335-341">Crane, p. 341</ref> It was a promise that, in the event, he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. He based his expedition at [[Cape Royds]] in [[McMurdo Sound]], and this breach of agreement caused a profound shift in the Scott<U+2013>Shackleton relationship.<ref>Preston, p. 89</ref>  Historian Beau Riffenburgh states that the promise to Scott "should never ethically have been demanded", and compares Scott's intransigence on this matter unfavourably with the generous attitudes of the Norwegian explorer [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who gave freely of his advice and expertise to all, whether they were potential rivals or not.<ref name = "Riffenbaugh_110-18">Riffenburgh, p. 118</ref>

===Marriage===
Scott, who because of his ''Discovery'' fame had entered [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] society, first met [[Kathleen Bruce]] early in 1907, at a private luncheon party.<ref>Crane, p. 344</ref> She was a sculptor, socialite and cosmopolitan who had studied under [[Auguste Rodin]]<ref>Preston, p. 94</ref> and whose circle included [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Picasso]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>Crane, p. 350</ref> Her initial meeting with Scott was brief, but when they met again later that year, the mutual attraction was obvious. A stormy courtship followed; Scott was not her only suitor <U+2013> his main rival was would-be novelist [[Gilbert Cannan]] <U+2013> and his absences at sea did not assist his cause.<ref>Crane, pp. 362<U+2013>66</ref> However, Scott's persistence was rewarded and, on 2 September 1908, at the Chapel Royal, [[Hampton Court Palace]], the wedding took place.<ref>Crane, pp. 373&ndash;74</ref> Their only child, [[Peter Scott|Peter Markham Scott]], was born on 14 September 1909.<ref>Crane, p. 387</ref>

By this time, Scott had announced his plans for his second Antarctic expedition. Shackleton had returned, having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed.<ref>Preston, pp. 100<U+2013>01</ref> On 24 March 1909, he had taken the Admiralty-based appointment of Naval Assistant to the [[Second Sea Lord]] which placed him handily in London. In December, he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, to be known as the [[Terra Nova Expedition]] from its ship, ''Terra Nova''.<ref>Fiennes, p. 161</ref>

===Preparation===
It was the expressed hope of the RGS that this expedition would be "scientific primarily, with exploration and the Pole as secondary objects"<ref name = "Crane_397-99">Crane, pp. 397&ndash;99</ref>  but, unlike the Discovery Expedition, neither they nor the Royal Society were in charge this time. In his expedition prospectus, Scott stated that its main objective was "to reach the South Pole, and to secure for the [[British Empire]] the honour of this achievement".<ref name = "Crane_397-99"/><ref>In the film ''Ninety Degrees South'', the narrator H. G. Ponting says that Scott set out from the London docks with "enthusiasm for achievement for the honour of his country."</ref> Scott had, as Markham observed, been "bitten by the Pole mania".<ref name = "Crane_397-99"/>

Scott did not know that he would be in a race until he received Amundsen's telegram in [[Melbourne]], in October 1910.<ref>Crane, pp. 425&ndash;28</ref>  Before this, he had set about fashioning the expedition according to his own preferences, without the restraints of a joint committee. So far as transport was concerned, he decided that dogs would be one element in a complex strategy that also involved horses and motor sledges, and much man-hauling. Scott knew nothing of horses, but felt that as they had seemingly served Shackleton well, he ought to use them.<ref>Preston, p. 107. Also Crane, pp. 432&ndash;33</ref>  Dog expert [[Cecil Meares]] was going to [[Siberia]] to select the dogs, and Scott ordered that, while he was there, he should deal with the purchase of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work.<ref name="Preston, p. 113"/> Meanwhile, Scott spent time in France and Norway, testing motor-sledges, and recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.<ref>Preston, p. 112</ref>

===First season===
[[Image:Robert Falcon Scott by Herbert Ponting.jpg|thumb|alt= Man sitting cross-legged at table, pipe in hand, apparently writing. Much clutter of clothing, books and equipment is in the background.|Scott, writing his journal in the [[Cape Evans]] hut, winter 1911]]
The expedition itself suffered a series of early misfortunes, which hampered the first season's work and impaired preparations for the main polar march. On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic, ''Terra Nova'' was trapped in [[pack ice]] for 20&nbsp;days,<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 30&ndash;71</ref> far longer than other ships had experienced, which meant a late-season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter. One of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship, disappearing through the sea ice.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 106&ndash;07</ref>  Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition's main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid {{convert|35|mi|km}} north of its planned location at 80<U+00B0>S. Laurence Oates, in charge of the ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80<U+00B0>S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, "Sir, I<U+2019>m afraid you<U+2019>ll come to regret not taking my advice."<ref>Crane, p.466.</ref> Six ponies died during this journey. On its return to base, the expedition learned of the presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the [[Bay of Whales]], 200&nbsp;miles (320&nbsp;km) to their east.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 187&ndash;88</ref>

Scott refused to amend his schedule to deal with the Amundsen threat, writing, "The proper, as well as the wiser course, is for us to proceed exactly as though this had not happened".<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, pp. 187&ndash;88</ref> While acknowledging that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole and that his experience as a dog driver was formidable, Scott had the advantage of travelling over a known route, that pioneered by Shackleton. During the 1911 winter, his confidence increased; On 2 August, after the return of a three-man party from their winter journey to [[Cape Crozier]], Scott wrote, "I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct".<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 369</ref>

===Journey to the Pole===
The march south began on 1 November 1911, a caravan of mixed transport groups (motors, dogs, horses), with loaded sledges, travelling at different rates, all designed to support a final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole. Scott had earlier outlined his plans for the southern journey to the entire shore party,<ref>Huxley, Vol I, p. 407</ref> without being specific about precise roles <U+2013> no one knew who would form the final polar team. During the journey, Scott sent a series of conflicting orders back to base concerning the future use of the expedition's dogs, leaving it unclear whether they were to be saved for future scientific journeys or were to assist the polar party home.<ref>Cherry-Garrard, pp. 30&ndash;32</ref> Scott's subordinates back at base were unsure of Scott's intentions, and consequently failed to use the dogs in a concerted attempt to relieve the returning polar party when the need arose.<ref>See Atkinson's account in L. Huxley, Vol II, pp. 298&ndash;306</ref>

The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back. By 4 January 1912, the last two four-man groups had reached 87<U+00B0>34'S.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 528</ref>  Scott announced his decision: five men (Scott, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward Wilson]], [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Henry Bowers]], [[Lawrence Oates]] and [[Edgar Evans]]) would go forward, the other three ([[Teddy Evans]], [[William Lashly]] and [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]]) would return.  The chosen group marched on, reaching the Pole on 17 January 1912, only to find that Amundsen had preceded them by five weeks. Scott's anguish is indicated in his diary: "The worst has happened";  "All the day dreams must go"; "Great God! This is an awful place".<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, pp. 543&ndash;44</ref>

===Last march===
[[Image:Scottgroup.jpg|thumb|alt=Five men(three standing, two sitting on the icy ground) in heavy polar clothing. All look exhausted and unhappy.

Scott's party at the South Pole.<Br> Left to right: Wilson; Bowers; Evans; Scott; Oates|Scott's group took this photograph of themselves using a string to operate the shutter on 17 January 1912, the day after they discovered Amundsen had reached the pole first.]]

The deflated party began the {{convert|800|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey on 19 January. "I'm afraid the return journey is going to be dreadfully tiring and monotonous", wrote Scott on the next day.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 548</ref>  However, the party made good progress despite poor weather, and had completed the Polar Plateau stage of their journey, approximately 300&nbsp;miles (500&nbsp;km), by 7 February. In the following days, as the party made the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} descent of the [[Beardmore Glacier]], the physical condition of Edgar Evans, which Scott had noted with concern as early as 23 January, declined sharply.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 551</ref>  A fall on 4 February had left Evans "dull and incapable",<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 560</ref> and on 17 February, after a further fall, he died near the glacier foot.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, pp. 572&ndash;73</ref>

With 400&nbsp;miles (670&nbsp;km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, the party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, frostbite, [[snow blindness]], hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 574<U+2013>80</ref> On 16 March, Oates, whose condition was aggravated by an old war-wound to the extent that he was barely able to walk,<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, p. 589: "Titus Oates is very near the end" &ndash; Scott diary entry, 11 March 1912</ref> voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I, pp. 591&ndash;92</ref> Scott wrote that Oates' last words were, "I am just going outside and may be some time."<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I p. 592</ref>
[[Image:RoaldAmundsen.JPG|thumb|100px|left|alt=Head of a short-haired man with dark beard, looking staight to camera|[[Roald Amundsen]]]]
After walking a further 20&nbsp;miles, the three remaining men made their final camp on 19 March, {{convert|11|mi|km|}} short of One Ton Depot, but 24&nbsp;miles (38&nbsp;km) beyond the original intended location of the depot. The next day a fierce blizzard prevented their making any progress.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I p. 594</ref> During the next nine days, as their supplies ran out, with frozen fingers, little light, and storms still raging outside the tent, Scott wrote his final words, although he gave up his diary after 23 March, save for a final entry on 29 March, with its concluding words: "Last entry. For God's sake look after our people".<ref>L. Huxley, p. 595</ref>  He left letters to Wilson's mother, Bowers' mother, a string of notables including his former commander [[George Egerton (Royal Navy officer)|Sir George Egerton]], his own mother and his wife.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 597<U+2013>604</ref> He also wrote his "Message To The Public", primarily a defence of the expedition's organisation and conduct in which the party's failure is adduced to weather and other misfortunes, but ending on an inspirational note, with these words:

{{quote|We took risks, we knew we took them; things have come out against us, and therefore we have no cause for complaint, but bow to the will of Providence, determined still to do our best to the last [...] Had we lived, I should have had a tale to tell of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my companions which would have stirred the heart of every Englishman. These rough notes and our dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely, a great rich country like ours will see that those who are dependent on us are properly provided for.<ref name = "Message_to_the_Public_SLE_Vol_I_605-07">From Scott's Message to the Public, L. Huxley, Vol I pp. 605&ndash;07</ref>}}

Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912, possibly a day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent, when it was discovered eight months later, suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol I p. 596, Jones, p. 126. Huntford says (p. 509) that Bowers was probably the last to die, citing evidence on p. 528.</ref>

The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912 and their records retrieved. Their final camp became their tomb; a high cairn of snow was erected over it, topped by a roughly fashioned cross.<ref>L. Huxley, Vol II, pp. 345&ndash;47</ref>  In January 1913, before ''Terra Nova'' left for home, a large wooden cross was made by the ship's carpenters, inscribed with the names of the lost party and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s line from his poem [[Ulysses (poem)|''Ulysses'']]: "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield", and was erected on [[Observation Hill (McMurdo Station)|Observation Hill]] overlooking [[Hut Point]].<ref>L. Huxley, Vol II, p. 398</ref>

The world was informed of the tragedy when ''Terra Nova'' reached [[Oamaru]], New Zealand, on 10 February 1913.<ref>Crane, pp. 1&ndash;2</ref> Within days, Scott became a national icon.<ref>Preston, p. 230</ref>  A fierce nationalistic spirit was aroused; the ''[[London Evening News]]'' called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land,<ref>Max Jones, pp. 199&ndash;201</ref> to coincide with the memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 14 February.  [[Robert Baden-Powell]], founder of the [[Boy Scouts Association]], asked: "Are Britons going downhill? No!...There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all. Captain Scott and Captain Oates have shown us that".<ref name = "Max_Jones_204-206">Jones, p. 204</ref> Eleven-year-old Mary Steel wrote a poem which ended:

::::Though naught but a simple cross
::::Now marks those heroes<U+2019> grave,
::::Their names will live forever!
::::Oh England, Land of the Brave!<ref name = "Max_Jones_20-206">Jones, p. 205&ndash;06</ref>

The survivors of the expedition were suitably honoured on their return, with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel.  In place of the knighthood that might have been her husband's had he survived, Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]].<ref>Preston, p. 231</ref><ref>This honour did not entitle Kathleen Scott to call herself "Lady Scott". Although both Fiennes, p. 383, and Huntford, p. 523, refer to her as "Lady Scott", this is not in accordance with The Times announcement, 22 February 1913</ref>  In 1922, she married [[Edward Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet|Edward Hilton Young]], later Lord Kennet (she becoming Lady Kennet), and remained a doughty defender of Scott's reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.<ref>Preston, p. 232</ref>

An article in ''[[The Times]]'', reporting on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press, claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were "[amazed] to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well-organized expedition".<ref>{{cite news|author=Unattributed|title=The Polar Disaster. Captain Scott's Career., Naval Officer And Explorer.|work=The Times|page=10|date=1913-02-11}}</ref> On learning the details of Scott's death, Amundsen is reported as saying, "I would gladly forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death".<ref>Huntford, p. 525</ref> Scott was much the better wordsmith of the two, and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him, with Amundsen's victory reduced in the eyes of many to an unsporting stratagem.<ref>Amundsen, ''The South Pole'' publisher's note, 1976 edition.</ref> Even before Scott's death was known, Amundsen had been offended by what he felt was a "sneering toast"' from RGS President [[Lord Curzon]], at a meeting held supposedly to honour the polar victor. Curzon had called for "three cheers for the dogs". According to Huntford's account, this slight caused Amundsen to resign his honorary RGS fellowship.<ref>Huntford, p. 538</ref><ref>Jones, p. 90</ref>

The response to Scott's final plea on behalf of the dependents of the dead was enormous by the standards of the day. The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at <U+00A3>75,000 (2009 approximation <U+00A3>5.5&nbsp;million). This was not equally distributed; Scott's widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of <U+00A3>18,000 (<U+00A3>1.3 million). Wilson's widow got <U+00A3>8,500 (<U+00A3>600,000) and Bowers's mother <U+00A3>4,500 (<U+00A3>330,000). Edgar Evans's widow, children and mother received <U+00A3>1,500 (<U+00A3>109,000) between them.<ref>Jones, pp. 106&ndash;108. <U+00A3>34,000 (2009 = <U+00A3>2.5m) in total went to relatives, <U+00A3>17,500 (<U+00A3>1.2 million) to the publication of the scientific results, <U+00A3>5,100 (<U+00A3>370,000) to meet expedition debts, and the balance to the creation of suitable monuments and memorials.</ref><ref>All present-day values calculated on RPI basis per Measuringworth{{cite web|title= Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a UK Pound Amount, 1830 to Present|url= http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|publisher= MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate= 14 October 2010}}</ref>

In the dozen years following the disaster, more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone. These ranged from simple relics (Scott's sledging flag in Exeter Cathedral) to the foundation of the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]]  at [[Cambridge]]. Many more were established in other parts of the world.<ref>See Jones, p. 295&ndash;96 for a full listing of British memorials.</ref>  The US scientific base at the South Pole, founded in 1957, is called the [[Amundsen<U+2013>Scott South Pole Station]], to honour the memories of both polar conquerors.

Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of the disaster in 1962.<ref name= Jones287>Jones, pp. 287<U+2013>89</ref> A few years after that, Reginald Pound, the first biographer given access to Scott's original sledging journal, revealed personal failings which cast a new light on Scott,<ref name= Jones287/> although Pound continued to endorse his heroism, writing of "a splendid sanity that would not be subdued".<ref>Pound, pp. 285<U+2013>86</ref> Within the following decade, further books appeared, each of which to some degree challenged the prevailing public perception. The most critical of these was David Thomson's ''Scott's Men'' (1977); in Thomson's view, Scott was not a great man, "at least, not until near the end";<ref>Thomson, Preface, p. xiii</ref> his planning is described as "haphazard" and "flawed",<ref>Thomson, p. 153 and p. 218</ref> his leadership characterized by lack of foresight.<ref>Thomson, p. 233</ref> Thus by the late 1970s, in Jones's words, "Scott's complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned."<ref name= Jones287/>
[[Image:Scott memorial binton.jpg|thumb|alt=Three figures are depicted in coloured glass, standing by a cairn of snow topped by a large cross. The scene is framed by a decorative arch.|Memorial window in Binton Church, [[Warwickshire]], one of four panels. This one depicts the cairn erected over the site of Scott's last tent.]]

In 1979 came the most sustained attack on Scott, from [[Roland Huntford]]'s dual biography ''Scott and Amundsen'' in which Scott is depicted as a "heroic bungler".<ref>Huntford, p. 527</ref> Huntford's thesis had an immediate impact, becoming the new orthodoxy.<ref>Jones, p. 8</ref> Even Scott's heroism in the face of death is challenged; Huntford sees Scott's Message to the Public as a deceitful self-justification from a man who had led his comrades to their deaths.<ref name= Jones287/> After Huntford's book, debunking Captain Scott became commonplace; [[Francis Spufford]], in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott, refers to "devastating evidence of bungling",<ref>Spufford, p. 5</ref> concluding that "Scott doomed his companions, then covered his tracks with rhetoric".<ref>Spufford, pp. 104<U+2013>05</ref> Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] summarised Scott as "confused and demoralised ... an enigma to his men, unprepared and a bungler".<ref>Quoted in Barczewski, p. 260</ref> This decline in Scott's reputation was accompanied by a corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton, at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well.<ref name= Barczewski283>Barczewski, p. 283</ref> A 2002 nationwide [[Opinion poll|poll]] in the United Kingdom to discover the "[[100 Greatest Britons]]" showed Shackleton in eleventh place, Scott well down the list at 54th.<ref name= Barczewski283/>

However, the early years of the 21st century have seen a shift of opinion in Scott's favour, in what cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski calls "a revision of the revisionist view."<ref name= Barczewski305>Barczewski, pp. 305<U+2013>311</ref>  Meteorologist [[Susan Solomon]]'s 2001 account ''The Coldest March'' ties the fate of Scott's party to the extraordinarily adverse Barrier weather conditions of February and March 1912 rather than to personal or organizational failings, although Solomon accepts the validity of some of the criticisms of Scott.<ref>Solomon, pp. 309<U+2013>327; see also Barczewski, p. 306</ref> In 2004 polar explorer Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]] published a biography which was a strong defence of Scott and an equally forthright rebuttal of Huntford; the book is dedicated "To the Families of the Defamed Dead".<ref name= Barczewski305/><ref>Fiennes's book was published in the United States as ''Race to the Pole: Tragedy, Heroism and Scott's Antarctic Quest''. Barczewski, p. 378.</ref> Fiennes was later criticised for the personal nature of his attacks on Huntford, and for his apparent assumption that his own experiences as a polar explorer gave him unique authority.<ref>{{cite news|last= Dore|first= Jonathan|title= Crucible of Ice|work= New York Times|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/review/Dore.t.html?scp=2&sq=ranulph%20fiennes%20and%20scott&st=cse|accessdate= 14 April 2009| date=3 December 2006}}</ref>

In 2005, [[David Crane (historian)|David Crane]] published a new Scott biography which, according to Barczewski, goes some way towards an assessment of Scott "free from the baggage of earlier interpretations."<ref name= Barczewski305/> What has happened to Scott's reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the heroic myth was formed: "It is not that we see him differently from the way they [his contemporaries] did, but that we see him the same, and instinctively do not like it."<ref>Crane, p. 11</ref> Crane's main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott's humanity, "far more effectively than either Fiennes's stridency or Solomon's scientific data."<ref name= Barczewski305/> ''Daily Telegraph'' columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers' reputations to climatic variations, suggests that "in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years."<ref>{{cite news|last= Rees|first= Jasper|title= Ice in our Hearts|work= Daily Telegraph|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3633687/Ice-in-our-hearts.html|date= 18 December 2004|accessdate= 14 April 200|date=format- dmy | location=London}}</ref>
