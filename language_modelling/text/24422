The '''1939 Soviet invasion of Poland''' was a military operation that started without a formal declaration of war on 17 September 1939, during the early stages of [[World War II]], sixteen days after the beginning of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on Poland]]. It ended in a decisive victory for the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]].

In early 1939, the Soviet Union tried to form an alliance against Nazi Germany with the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]; but several difficulties arose, including the Soviet demand that Poland and Romania allow Soviet troops transit rights through their territories as part of [[collective security]].<ref name="Cienciala">[[Anna M.

In the late 1930s the Soviet Union tried to form an anti-German alliance with the United Kingdom, France, and Poland.{{Ref_label|h|h|none}} The negotiations, however, proved difficult. The Soviets insisted on a sphere of influence stretching from Finland to Romania and asked for military support not only against anyone who attacked them directly but against anyone who attacked the countries in their proposed sphere of influence.<ref>Shaw, p 119; Neilson, p 298.</ref> From the beginning of the negotiations with France and Britain it was clear that Soviet Union demanded the right to occupy the [[Baltic States]] ([[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], and [[Lithuania]]).<ref name="Grogin">"Natural Enemies: The United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War 1917-1991" by Robert C.

Press</ref> and the Soviets finally also demanded the right to enter Poland, Romania, and the Baltic States whenever they felt their security was threatened. The governments of those countries rejected the proposal because, as [[Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs|Polish foreign minister]] [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]] pointed out, they feared that once the Red Army entered their territories it might never leave.<ref name="Cienciala"/> The Soviets did not trust the British and French to honour [[collective security]], since they had failed to [[Spanish Civil War|assist Spain]] against the [[Falange|Fascists]] or [[Treaty of Munich|protect Czechoslovakia]] from the Nazis. They also suspected that the [[Western Allies]] would prefer the Soviet Union to fight Germany by itself, while they watched from the sidelines.<ref>Kenez, A history of the Soviet Union from the beginning to the end, pp. 129<U+2013>31.</ref> In view of these concerns the Soviet Union abandoned the talks and turned instead to negotiations with Germany.

On 23 August 1939 the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany, taking the allies by surprise. The two governments announced the agreement merely as a [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression treaty]]. According to a secret [[appendix]], however, they had actually agreed to partition Poland between themselves and divide [[Eastern Europe]] into Soviet and German [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].{{Ref_label|d|d|none}} The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which has been described as a license for war, was a key factor in Hitler<U+2019>s decision to [[invasion of Poland|invade Poland]].<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref>Davies, ''Europe: A History'', p. 997.</ref>

Soon after the Germans [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] Poland on 1 September 1939, the Nazi leaders began urging the Soviets to play their agreed part and attack Poland from the east. The German ambassador to [[Moscow]], [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]], and the Soviet [[List of Russian foreign ministers|foreign minister]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], exchanged a series of diplomatic communiqu<U+00E9>s on the matter.<ref name="SCHULENBURG"/>

{{quote|''Then Molotov came to the political side of the matter and stated that the Soviet Government had intended to take the occasion of the further advance of German troops to declare that Poland was falling apart and that it was necessary for the Soviet Union, in consequence, to come to the aid of the Ukrainians and the White Russians "threatened" by Germany. This argument was to make the intervention of the Soviet Union plausible to the masses and at the same time avoid giving the Soviet Union the appearance of an aggressor.''|Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg, German ambassador to Moscow in a [[telegram]] to the German Foreign Office, Moscow, September 10 1939<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/ns069.htm The Avalon Project at Yale Law School; The German Ambassador in the Soviet Union, (Schulenburg) to the German Foreign Office, Telegram VERY URGENT Moscow, September 10, 1939-9:40 p. m.

The invasion was planned by Stalin, [[Kliment Voroshilov]], [[Boris Shaposhnikov]], and [[Grigory Kulik]]. A few hours before it began, already on September 17, 1939, at 2 a.m., Stalin, with Molotov and Voroshilov, informed German ambassador in Moscow, [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]], that Soviet troops would soon cross the border. Stalin said: "At 6 a.m., four hours from now, the Red Army will cross into Poland".<ref name="Simon Sebag Montefiore page 312">[Simon Sebag Montefiore. Stalin. The Court of the Red Tsar, page 312.

The Red Army entered the [[Kresy|eastern regions of Poland]] with seven [[field army|field armies]] and between 450,000 and 1,000,000 troops.<ref name="Sanford"/> These were deployed on two [[Front (Soviet Army)|fronts]]: the [[Belorussian Front (1939)|Belarusian Front]] under [[Mikhail Kovalyov]], and the [[Ukrainian Front (1939)|Ukrainian Front]] under [[Semyon Timoshenko]].<ref name="Sanford"/> By this time, the Poles had already failed to [[Battle of the Border|defend their western borders]], and in response to German incursions had launched a major counter-offensive in the [[Battle of the Bzura]]. The Polish Army originally had a well-developed [[Plan Wsch<U+00F3>d|defensive plan to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union]], but was unprepared to face two invasions at once; nor did the Polish military strategists believe that it made any sense to offer more than a token resistance if attacked by both the Germans and the Soviets. However, in spite of that belief, the Polish military had not developed an [[evacuation]] plan for this contingency, leading to the death and capture of many Polish soldiers who engaged in an uncoordinated and ineffective defense.<ref name="Wsch<U+00F3>d">Szuba<U+0144>ski, ''Plan operacyjny "Wsch<U+00F3>d"''.</ref> By the time the Soviets invaded, the Polish commanders had sent most of their troops west to face the Germans, leaving the east protected by only twenty under-strength battalions. These battalions consisted of about 20,000 troops of border defence corps, or ''[[Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza]]'', under the command of general [[Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann]].<ref name="Wojsko"/><ref name="Sanford">[[George Sanford (scholar)|Sanford]], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415338735&id=PZXvUuvfv-oC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&ots=_1tnCiY3_f&dq=Soviet+invasion+of+Poland+1939&sig=WpYsVr5jLk6yIVAYnQqeR3hdXMU p. 20<U+2013>24.]</ref>

At first, the Polish [[commander-in-chief]], [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]], ordered the border forces to resist the Soviet invasion, but changed his orders after consulting with [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Felicjan S<U+0142>awoj Sk<U+0142>adkowski]], commanding them to fall back and engage the Soviets only in self-defense.<ref name="Wojsko"/><ref name="Gross">Gross, p. 17.</ref>

[[Image:Wrzesien2.jpg|thumb|Line of demarcation between German and Soviet military forces after their joint invasion of Poland in September 1939]]
The two conflicting sets of orders led to confusion,<ref name="Sanford"/> and when the Red Army advanced on Polish units, clashes and small battles inevitably broke out.<ref name="Wojsko"/> The response of non-ethnic Poles to the situation added a further complication. Many [[Ukrainians]],{{Ref_label|m|m|none}} [[Belarusians]]<ref>Piotrowski, p 199.</ref> and [[Jew]]s<ref>Gross, pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref> welcomed the invading troops as liberators. It was mentioned by [[Lev Mekhlis]], who told Stalin that people of West Ukraine welcomed the Soviets "like true liberators".<ref name="Simon Sebag Montefiore page 312"/> The [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] rebelled against the Poles, and communist partisans organized local uprisings, such as that in [[Skidel]].<ref name="Sanford"/>{{Ref_label|j|j|none}}

The Polish military's original fall-back plan was to retreat and regroup along the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], an area in south-east Poland near the border with Romania. The idea was to adopt defensive positions there and wait for the much-expected French and British attack in the west. This plan assumed that Germany would have to reduce its operations in Poland in order to fight on a second front in Western Europe.<ref name="Sanford"/> The allies had expected Polish forces to hold out for up to several months, which whether or not it was ever realistic was quickly made impossible under the weight of a second front in the east.

The Polish political and military leaders knew that they were losing the war against Germany even before the Soviet invasion settled the issue.<ref name="Sanford"/> Nevertheless, they refused to surrender or negotiate a peace with Germany, deciding to abandon the remaining areas of Poland under their control as indefensible and place their hopes in the Allies to retake Poland. In keeping with this new strategy, the Polish government ordered all military units to evacuate Poland and reassemble in [[France]].<ref name="Sanford"/> The government itself crossed into [[Romania]] at around midnight on 17 September 1939 through the border-crossing in [[Zaleszczyki]]. Polish units proceeded to manoeuvre towards the Romanian bridgehead area, sustaining German attacks on one flank and occasionally clashing with Soviet troops on the other. In the days following the evacuation order, the Germans defeated and disintegrated the Polish [[Army Krak<U+00F3>w|Armies ''Krak<U+00F3>w'']] and [[Army Lublin|''Lublin'']] at the [[Battle of Tomasz<U+00F3>w Lubelski]], which lasted from 17 September to 20 September.<ref>Taylor, p. 38.</ref>

Soviet units often met their German counterparts advancing from the opposite direction. Several notable examples of co-operation occurred between the two armies in the field. The [[Wehrmacht]] passed the [[Brest Fortress]], which had been seized after the [[Battle of Brze<U+015B><U+0107> Litewski]], to the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade on 17 September.<ref name="Fischer">[[Benjamin B.

The reaction of France and Britain to the Soviet invasion and annexation of Eastern Poland was muted, since neither country wanted to start a confrontation with the Soviet Union at that time.<ref name="prazmowska"/> Under the terms of the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact|Anglo-Polish Agreement]] of 25 August 1939, the British had promised Poland assistance if attacked by a European power;{{Ref_label|k|k|none}} but when Polish Ambassador [[Edward Bernard Raczy<U+0144>ski|Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski]] reminded [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[E.

Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] of the pact, he was bluntly told that it was Britain's decision whether to declare war on the Soviet Union.<ref name="prazmowska"/> [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] considered making a public commitment to restore the Polish state in the entirety of its pre-war territory, but in the end issued only general statements of condemnation:<ref name="prazmowska">Prazmowska, pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref> 

{{quote|Communism is now the great danger, greater even than Nazi Germany. It is a plague that does not stop at national boundaries, and with the advance of the Soviet into Poland the states of Eastern Europe will find their powers of resistance to Communism very much weakened. It is thus vital that we should play our hand very carefully with Russia, and not destroy the possibility of uniting, if necessary, with a new German government against the common danger.|Neville Chamberlain, October 1939}}

[[Winston Churchill]] on the other hand issued another statement:

{{quote|That the Russian armies should stand on this line 
was clearly necessary for the safety of Russia against
the Nazi menace. At any rate, the line is
there, and an Eastern Front has been created which
Nazi Germany does not dare assail.

Churchill. Blood, Sweat, and Tears, p.173</ref>}}

The French had also made promises to Poland, including the provision of air support, but also opted not to attack the USSR. Once the Soviets moved into Poland, the French and the British decided there was nothing they could do for Poland in the short term and began planning for a long-term victory instead. The French had advanced tentatively into the [[Saar Offensive|Saar]] in early September, but after the Polish defeat, they retreated behind the [[Maginot Line]] on 4 October.<ref>Jackson, p. 75.</ref> Many Poles resented this lack of support from their western allies, which aroused a lasting sense of [[Western betrayal|betrayal]].

The mass deportations were motivated by class warfare<U+2014>Soviet propaganda hammered home the message that they were fighting a war against barbarism on behalf of civilization<U+2014>and obsessive security concerns. Less openly admitted advantages of the deportations were the redistribution of deportees' housing and land, the establishment of a back-up labour force prior to the inevitable war with Germany, and the radical alteration of the ethnic demographic of the annexed region.<ref name="Rieber14,32-37"/>

'''c.''' {{Note_label|c|c|none}} Among the population of Eastern territories were circa 38% Poles, 37% Ukrainians, 14.5% Belarusians, 8.4% Jewish, 0.9% Russians and 0.6% Germans.<ref>Trela-Mazur, p. 294.</ref>

'''d.''' {{Note_label|d|d|none}} Estonia and Latvia were placed in the Soviet sphere of influence and Lithuania in the German. According to [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], Germany had agreed to what Britain had refused: a free hand in the Baltic and a free hand in the Balkan states. On 28 September, the border was redefined by adding the area between the Vistula and Bug to the German sphere and moving Lithuania into the Soviet sphere.<ref>Sanford, p. 21; Weinberg, p. 963.</ref>

'''e.''' {{Note_label|e|e|none}} "Polish specialists claim up to 3000 killed and 8,000<U+2013>10,000 wounded."<ref>Sanford, p 23.</ref>

'''f.''' {{Note_label|f|f|none}} On 7 September 1939, Stalin told the secretary general of the [[Comintern]], [[Georgi Dimitrov]]: "War is going on between two groups of capitalist countries...for the division of the world, for domination of the entire world. We are not against their tearing one another to pieces and weakening one another." He called Poland a [[Fascism|fascist]] state which had oppressed Ukrainians, Belorussians and others, and stressed that "the liquidisation of this government under present conditions would mean one fascist government less. It wouldn<U+2019>t be so bad if as a result of the destruction of Poland we extended the socialist system to new territories and populations."<ref>Rieber, p. 29.</ref>

'''g.''' {{Note_label|g|g|none}} The Soviets in effect repudiated the [[Polish-Soviet Riga Peace Treaty|Riga Peace Treaty]] and the [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]. They also violated the 1919 [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] (to which the USSR subscribed in 1934), the [[Briand-Kellog Pact]] of 1928 and the 1933 [[London Convention on the Definition of Aggression]].<ref name="Piotrowski295">Piotrowski, p. 295.</ref>

'''h.''' {{Note_label|h|h|none}} "The USSR proposed a ten-year Anglo-French-Soviet alliance which would include Rumania and Poland."<ref>Gronowicz, p. 51.</ref>

'''i.''' {{Note_label|i|i|none}} The voters had a choice of only one candidate for each position of deputy; the communist party commissars then provided the assemblies with resolutions that would push through nationalization of banks and heavy industry and transfers of land to peasant communities.<ref>Rieber, pp. 29<U+2013>30.</ref>

'''j.''' {{Note_label|j|j|none}} For other examples, described by an officer witness, see: Bronis<U+0142>aw Konieczny, in ''M<U+00F3>j wrzesie<U+0144> 1939. Pami<U+0119>tnik z kampanii wrze<U+015B>niowej spisany w obozie jenieckim'' and ''Moje <U+017C>ycie w mundurze. Czasy narodzin i upadku II RP''.

'''k.''' {{Note_label|k|k|none}} The "Agreement of Mutual Assistance between the United Kingdom and Poland" (London, 25 August 1939) states in Article 1: "Should one of the Contracting Parties become engaged in hostilities with a European Power in consequence of aggression by the latter against that Contracting Party, the other Contracting Party will at once give the Contracting Party engaged in hostilities all the support and assistance in its power."<ref>Stachura, p.125.</ref>

'''l.''' {{Note_label|l|l|none}} Some Ukrainians and Belarusians lived in the areas traded to Germany by the Soviets in the agreement of 28 October. For example, [[Che<U+0142>m]] and [[Lemkivshchyna]] (<U+0141>emkowszczyzna), both with significant Ukrainian populations, were among the Ukrainian enclaves left in German-occupied Poland (see maps).

'''m.''' {{Note_label|m|m|none}} "How are we ... to explain the phenomenon of Ukrainians rejoicing and collaborating with the Soviets? Who were these Ukrainians? That they were Ukrainians is certain, but were they communists, Nationalists, unattached peasants? The answer is "yes<U+2014>they were all three".<ref>Piotrowski, p.199.</ref>

'''n.''' {{Note_label|n|n|none}} "The Soviet Union's invasion and occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939 was a clear act of aggression in international law...But the Soviets did not declare war, nor did the Poles respond with a declaration of war. As a result there was confusion over the status of soldiers taken captive and whether they qualified for treatment as PoWs. Jurists consider that the absence of a formal declaration of war does not absolve a power from the obligations of civilised conduct towards PoWs. On the contrary, failure to do so makes those involved, both leaders and operational subordinates, liable to charges of War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity."<ref>Sanford, p 39, 22<U+2013>3.</ref>

'''o.''' {{Note_label|o|o|none}} "It is generally known, however, that the British and French governments turned down German peace efforts, made public by her already at the end of last year, which for its part, owed to preparations to escalate the war." [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], 29 March 1940.<ref>Molotov, V.M., [http://www.histdoc.net/history/molotov.html Report On The Foreign Policy Of The Government], 29 March 1940. ''Moscow News'', 1 April 1940.
