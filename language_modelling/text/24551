'''Oh No They Didn't''', also known as '''ONTD''', is the largest<ref>[http://www.livejournalinc.com/aboutus.php "Livejournal Inc. <U+2013> About Us"], retrieved on 2009-02-27.</ref> community on [[LiveJournal]], with over 100,000 members.<ref>[http://news.livejournal.com/124116.html "LiveJournal news"], retrieved on 2010-04-29</ref> The community focuses on celebrity gossip and [[pop culture]], with most of its posts taken and sourced from other gossip blogs. 

The blog boasts over 300,000 page views daily, according to [[Popmatters]].<ref name="popmatters">[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/through-the-grapevine "Through the Grapewine"], ''[[PopMatters]]'', 2008-06-09. Retrieved 2009-06-19.</ref> When LiveJournal increased the comment limit on posts from 5000 to 10,000 comments, ONTD contained the first post to reach this new limit.<ref>{{cite book |last= Livejournal |authorlink = Livejournal |title= LiveJournal: The First Decade |publisher= [[Blurb]] |year= 2009 |month= September |url=http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4403/page1ca.png}}</ref>

==Editorial style==
The community publishes an average of 150 member posts per day<ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/2009/ "ONTD! Calendar"], retrieved 2009-02-27.</ref>, each post getting between 100 and 300 comments on average. The community moderators post a weekly post called ''Free for All Friday'' which allows members to post off-topic comments. These free-for-all posts have often been expanded to include community discussion posts for important pop culture events such as the [[Academy Awards]], the [[Olympics]] (known as "Free for All Olympics" or "FFAO" posts) and [[Saturday Night Live]].

In addition to members submitting the posts themselves, ONTD relies heavily on user participation in the comments section, where members can express their opinions on posts. Members often illustrate their reaction to a particular news item by posting an animated [[GIF]] image which represents their feelings. After the death of [[Michael Jackson]] on June 25, 2009, according to [[MSNBC]], "users expressed their collective grief by posting a [[Fantasia Barrino]] gif, in which the [[American Idol]] star wails and flails her arms wildly,"<ref name="msnbc">Popkin, Helen A.S.: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31571885/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/ "'Net Big Enough For Michael Jackson and Iran"], ''[[MSNBC]]'' 2009-06-26. Retrieved on 2009-06-26.</ref> while other users expressed concern over the continued use of a popular GIF taken from "''[[Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]''" music video featuring a scene of Jackson eating popcorn, an image that is frequently posted on the community in anticipation of a controversial or "flame-worthy topic."<ref name="msnbc" />

Oh No They Didn't's popularity has resulted in a series of spin-off communities which follow the same format, but with a different or specialized topic, such as ontd_political for politics. A comprehensive list of other communities is available [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd_masterlist here].

==Awards and recognition==

[[The Village Voice]] called the community a "psychopathic celebrity news/gossip wire-of-sorts" and its users "a community of pathologically obsessive celebrity gossip sadomasochists."<ref>[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/04/andrew_breitbar_2.php Andrew Breitbart vs. Oh No They Didn't: A Media Spat with Epic Potential]</ref>

== Exclusives ==
The most notable ONTD exclusive was the [[Pete Wentz]] photo scandal, colloquially known among members as ''Peengate '06'', which occurred in March 2006, when nude photos of Wentz were posted on ONTD. The original poster reported that she received the photos third-hand, and that Wentz originally sent the pictures to a woman with whom he allegedly had romantic interests.<ref>The original post: [http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/5853634.html "ohnotheydidnt: (...) FOB Lead a Stupid Ass!"], retrieved 2009-02-27.</ref>  This event was alluded to in a blog post by Wentz himself in December 2006.<ref>[http://www.falloutboyrock.com/user/blog/default.aspx?mjid=5266&mid=315205 Pete Wentz's blog]. ''falloutboyrock.com''. December 20, 2006. Retrieved June 9, 2009.</ref> This went on to be parodied in [[Fall Out Boy]]'s video for "''[[This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race]]''".

ONTD was also the first community to break the news of [[Jamie-Lynn Spears]]' pregnancy, after leaking ''[[OK! Magazine]]'''s unpublished front page cover,<ref name="popmatters" /> and was the first to report that [[Kirk Acevedo]] had announced via his [[Facebook]] status update that he had been fired from the Fox drama, ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''.<ref>Karger, Dave. [http://news-briefs.ew.com/2009/05/fringe-star-ann.html 'Fringe' star Kirk Acevedo announces firing on Facebook?]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. May 20, 2009. Retrieved June 18, 2009.</ref>

When the rumors of Jon from [[Jon & Kate Plus 8|Jon and Kate Gosselin]]'s infidelity started appearing in February 2009, a photo of Jon out on town was posted on ONTD, which showed him posing with two young women in a local bar. National gossip magazines picked up the news, and a screen grab of ONTD could be seen in ''[[Star (magazine)|Star]]''<ref>[[Star (magazine)]], issue 03-04-2009, page 58-59.</ref> and ''[[US Weekly]]''.<ref>[[US Weekly]], issue 03-11-2009, page 42.</ref>

The most scandalous and notable events are often given nicknames to distinguish them in future posts, such as the January 2008 hospitalization of [[Britney Spears]], which was dubbed ''Hostage Brituation '08'' by the community's members.  This nickname was later picked up and used by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref>Kreps, Daniel: [http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/01/04/britney-spears-hospitalized-after-hostage-brituation-involving-her-two-kids/ "Britney Spears Hospitalized After <U+201C>Hostage Brituation<U+201D> Involving Her Two Kids; Released Next Day"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 2008-01-04. Retrieved 2009-02-27.</ref> The abuse case between singers [[Rihanna]] and [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] was dubbed ''Domestic Disturbia '09'' by the community's members<ref>[http://www.klue.com.my/articles/1261-Wednesdays-Word-Up-Domestic-Disturbia Wednesdays Word Up: Domestic Disturbia]</ref>, and the community was also credited with starting a [[meme]] ("Gokey is a douche") connected to some friends of ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Danny Gokey]]'s negative comments and pictures regarding fellow contestant [[Adam Lambert]].<ref>Montgomery, James. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1614260/20090618/story.jhtml Danny Gokey Detractors Take Their Fight To Twitter, Google]. ''[[MTV News]]''. June 18, 2009.

''[[Movieline]]'', 2009-06-18. Retrieved on 2009-06-19.</ref>

The community was also responsible for a hoax that claimed actress [[Betty White]] had died. After a post titled "Renner, Just Happy to Be Here" was approved to the community, the original poster edited the post to show a screen grab of a [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] article claiming White had died.<ref name=betty>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/gossip/2010/03/betty-white-death-hoax-fake.html Betty White is just fine -- though one hoaxer better lie low for a while]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. March 2, 2010. Retrieved March 3, 2010.</ref> Users displayed shock and confusion, before slowly realizing the article was a fake when not only did the source link just go to TMZ's main website, but the article mentioned "possibilities of foul play and drug abuse, and grandchildren that Betty White does not have."<ref>[http://maisontv.livejournal.com/69671.html The Cutting Room Floor - ALERT : Betty White is Alive]</ref> Community moderators deleted the post within 40 minutes, but not before "Betty White" became a Twitter trending topic. Once the hoax was discovered, fans urged each other to tweet #BettyWhiteFacts and other positive messages about White instead of spreading further death rumours.<ref name=betty />

Another notable hoax involved a fake Twitter screenshot of [[Michael Lohan]] saying his daughter [[Lindsay Lohan]] had an affair with [[Tommy Mottola]] when she was 17, and that she had HIV. Though the post was quickly deleted, Perez Hilton reported on the screenshot as if it were true and other gossip sites followed.<ref>[http://perezhilton.com/2010-04-27-lindsay-lohan-has-aids]</ref> <ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/06/AR2010050605861.html]</ref><ref>[http://gawker.com/5528363/the-lindsay-lohan-has-hiv-twitter-scam-that-fooled-everyone]</ref> Michael believed that the screenshot was real and that someone had hacked his Twitter account, while Lindsay refused to believe her father was innocent, stating "He's a grown man and has done the exact same things on TV/interviews, why wouldn't he lie on Twitter, and everywhere else!" The moderators of ONTD later apologized for the scandal, while stating that they were "pretty appalled to learn that NONE of the other gossip or news sites that posted the story bothered to check for accuracy and have yet to post a retraction or apology for spreading such a vicious rumor." <ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/46756241.html#comments]</ref>

== LiveJournal downtime ==
In January 2009, ONTD became the first LiveJournal community to surpass 16,777,216 (2<sup>24</sup>) comments. This exceeded LiveJournal's previously-unknown limit on comments.<ref name=calgary>Lewis, Nick. [http://www.calgaryherald.com/Entertainment/Gossip/1276968/story.html Web of Gossip]. ''[[Calgary Herald]]''. February 11, 2009.

Retrieved 2009-02-27.</ref> This resulted in almost a week of downtime for the community, while LiveJournal worked to fix the issue. A second community, [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/ ontd], was created and members posted and commented there until the issue was fixed. 

Oh No They Didn't was briefly suspended due to an explosion in usage following the [[Death of Michael Jackson|death]] of [[Michael Jackson]] on June 25, 2009. The amount of traffic the community received brought all of LiveJournal's servers down, resulting in downtime for the entire domain.<ref name="msnbc" /> During this time, members migrated temporarily to [http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/ ontd] once again.<ref>[http://community.livejournal.com/ontd/193207.html "Oops" - ONTD],</ref>
