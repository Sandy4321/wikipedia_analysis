During the '''history of Portugal between 1415 and 1542''', Portugal discovered an eastern route to [[India]] that rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colonial Brazil#Early colonial history (15th century-1530)|discovered]] [[Brazil]], established trading routes throughout most of [[southern Asia]], colonized selected areas of [[Africa]], and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to [[China]] and [[Japan]]. 

==Reasons for exploration==
Portugal's long shoreline, with its many harbours and rivers flowing westward to the [[Atlantic ocean]] was the ideal environment to raise generations of adventurous seamen. As a seafaring people in the south-westernmost region of [[Europe]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] became natural leaders of exploration during the [[Middle Ages]]. Faced with the options of either accessing other European markets by sea (by exploiting its seafaring prowess) or by land (and facing the task of crossing [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] territory) it is not surprising that goods were sent via the sea to [[England]], [[Flanders]], [[Italy]] and the [[Hanseatic league]] towns. 

Having fought to achieve and to retain independence, the nation's leadership had also a desire for fresh conquests. Added to this was a long struggle to expel the [[Moors]] that was religiously sanctioned and influenced by foreign [[crusades|crusaders]] with a desire for martial fame. Making war on [[Islam]] seemed to the Portuguese both their natural destiny and their duty as [[Christians]].

One important reason was the need to overcome the expensive eastern trade routes,  dominated first by the republics of Venice and Genoa in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], and then controlled by the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of [[Constantinople]] in 1453, barring European access, and going through North Africa and the historically important combined-land-sea routes via the Red Sea. Both spice and silk were big businesses of the day, and arguably, spices which were used as [[medicine]] [[drug]]s and preservatives was something of a necessity<U+2014>at least to those Europeans of better than modest means.

The [[Economic history of Portugal|Portuguese economy]] had benefited from its connections with neighbouring [[Muslim]] states. A money economy was well enough established for 15th century workers in the countryside as well as in the towns to be paid in [[currency]]. The agriculture of the countryside had diversified to the point where grain was imported from [[Morocco]] (a symptom of an economy dependent upon Portugal's), while specialised crops occupied former grain-growing areas: vineyards, olives, or the sugar factories of the [[Algarve]], later to be reproduced in [[Brazil]] (Braudel 1985). Most of all, the [[House of Aviz|Aviz]] dynasty that had come to power in 1385 marked the semi-eclipse of the conservative land-oriented aristocracy (See [[The Consolidation of the Monarchy in Portugal]].) Also, due to their close connections with several Islamic kingdoms, a constant exchange of cultural ideals made Portugal a centre of knowledge and technological development. Due to these connections with Islamic kingdoms, many [[mathematician]]s and experts in naval technology appeared in Portugal. The Portuguese government impelled this even further by taking full advantage of this and by creating several important research centres in Portugal, where Portuguese and foreign experts made several breakthroughs in the fields of mathematics, cartography and naval technology. [[Sagres Point|Sagres]] and [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] in the [[Algarve]] become famous as such places.

==Portuguese nautical science==
[[Image:Caravel Boa Esperanca Portugal.jpg|thumb|left|A Portuguese [[caravel]]]]
The successive expeditions and experience of the pilots led to a fairly rapid evolution of Portuguese nautical science, creating an elite of [[astronomers]], [[navigators]], [[mathematicians]] and [[cartographers]], among them stood [[Pedro Nunes]] with studies on how to determine the latitudes by the stars and [[Jo<U+00E3>o de Castro]].

==== Ships ====
Until the 15th century, the Portuguese were limited to coastal [[cabotage]] navigation using [[barque]]s and ''barinels'' (ancient cargo vessels used in the [[Mediterranean]]). These boats were small and fragile, with only one mast with a fixed quadrangular [[sails|sail]] and did not have the capabilities to overcome the navigational difficulties associated with Southward oceanic exploration, as the strong [[wind]]s, [[shoal]]s and strong [[ocean current]]s easily overwhelmed their abilities. They are associated with the earliest discoveries, such as the [[Madeira]] Islands, the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and to the early exploration of the north west African coast as far south as [[Arguim]] in the current [[Mauritania]].

The ship that truly launched the first phase of the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast was the [[caravel]], a development based on existing fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and 1 to 3 masts, with lateen triangular sails allowing [[luffing]]. The caravel benefited from a greater capacity to [[tack (sailing)|tack]]. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Among the famous caravels are Berrio and Caravela Annunciation.

With the start of long oceanic [[sailing]] also large ships developed. "Nau" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily [[merchant ship]]s. Due to the [[piracy]] that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the [[navy]] and were provided with canon windows, which led to the classification of "naus" according to the power of its artillery. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade: from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500, they become impressive in the 16th century, having usually two [[deck]]s, [[stern]] castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century there were also used [[carrack]]s, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2000 tons. 

==== Celestial navigation ====
[[File:AlmanachPerpetuum.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Ephemeris]] by [[Abraham Zacuto]] in Almanach Perpetuum, 1496]]
In the thirteenth century [[celestial navigation]] was already known, guided by the sun position. For celestial navigation the Portuguese, like other Europeans, used [[Arab]] navigation tools, like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], which they made easier and simpler. They also created the [[cross-staff]], or ''cane of Jacob'', for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The [[Southern Cross]] become a reference upon arrival at the Southern hemisphere by [[Jo<U+00E3>o de Santar<U+00E9>m]] and [[Pedro Escobar]] in 1471, starting the celestial navigation on this constellation. But the results varied throughout the year, which required corrections.

To this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables ([[Ephemeris]]), precious tools for oceanic navigation, which have experienced a remarkable diffusion in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing to calculate [[latitude]]. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]], published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]].

====Sailing techniques====
[[Image:Oceanic gyres.png|thumb|100px|left|Map of the five major [[oceanic gyre]]s]]
Besides coastal exploration, Portuguese also made trips off in the ocean to gather [[meteorological]] and [[oceanographic]] information (in these were discovered the archipelagoes of Madeira and the Azores, and [[Sargasso Sea]]). The knowledge of [[wind]] patterns and [[ocean current|currents]] - the [[trade winds]] and the [[oceanic gyre]]s in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the latitude of the Azores, using the permanent favorable winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of [[atmospheric circulation]] and the effect of [[Coriolis]], facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese venturing increasingly farther from shore, the maneuver that became known as "volta o mar". In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the [[Manila Galleon]] trade route.

====Cartography====
[[File:Fern<U+00E3>o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Pre-mercator navigation chart of the Coast of Africa (1571), by Fern<U+00E3>o Vaz Dourado (Torre do Tombo, Lisbon)]]
It is thought that [[Jehuda Cresques]], son of the Catalan cartographer Abraham Cresques have been one of the notable [[cartographers]] at the service of Prince Henry. However the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a [[Portolan chart|Portolan]] made by [[Pedro Reinel]] in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by [[Diogo C<U+00E3>o]]. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of [[latitude]]s in 1504 and the first representation of an [[Wind rose]]. 

With his son, cartographer [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Lopo Homem]], they participated in the making of the atlas known as "Lopo Homem-Rein<U+00E9>s Atlas" or "Miller Atlas", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time, with Emperor Charles V wanting them to work for him. In 1517 King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all [[compass]] needles in vessels.

In the third phase of the former Portuguese nautical cartography, characterized by the abandonment of the influence of [[Ptolemy]]'s representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents, stands out [[Fern<U+00E3>o Vaz Dourado]] (Goa ~ 1520 - ~ 1580), whose work has extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time. Many of his charts are large scale.

==Henry the Navigator==
It was the genius of [[Prince Henry the Navigator]] that coordinated and utilized all these tendencies towards expansion. Prince Henry placed at the disposal of his captains the vast resources of the [[Order of Christ]], of which he was the head, and the best information and most accurate instruments and maps that could be obtained. He sought to effect a meeting with the half-fabulous Christian Empire of "[[Prester John]]" by way of the "Western Nile" (the [[S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal River]]), and, in alliance with that potentate, to crush the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and liberate the [[Holy Land]]. The concept of an ocean route to India appears to have originated after his death. On land he again defeated the Moors, who attempted to retake [[Ceuta]] in 1418; but in an expedition to [[Tangier]], undertaken in 1436 by [[Edward of Portugal|King Edward]] (1433<U+2013>1438), the Portuguese army was defeated, and could only escape destruction by surrendering as a hostage [[Fernando, the Saint Prince|Prince Ferdinand]], the king's youngest brother. Ferdinand, known as "the Constant", from the fortitude with which he endured captivity, died unransomed in 1443. By sea Prince Henry's captains continued their exploration of [[Africa]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1433 [[Cape Bojador]] was rounded; in 1434 the first consignment of [[slaves]] was brought to [[Lisbon]]; and slave trading soon became the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce, until India was reached. The Senegal was reached in 1445, [[Cape Verde]] was passed in the same year, and in 1446 [[<U+00C1>lvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as [[Sierra Leone]]. This was probably the farthest point reached before the Navigator died in 1460. Another vector of the discoveries were the voyages westward, during which the Portuguese discovered the [[Sargasso Sea]] and possibly sighted the shores of [[Nova Scotia]] well before 1492.

==Treaty of Tordesillas==

{{main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
Meanwhile colonization progressed in the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], where [[sugar]] and [[wine]] were now produced; above all, the [[gold]] brought home from [[Guinea]] stimulated the commercial energy of the Portuguese. It had become clear that, apart from their religious and scientific aspects, these voyages of discovery were highly profitable. Under [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]] (1443<U+2013>1481), surnamed the African, the [[Gulf of Guinea]] was explored as far as Cape St Catherine (''Cabo Santa Caterina'')<ref>{{cite book

, and three expeditions (1458, 1461 and 1471) were sent to Morocco; in 1471 Arzila ([[Asilah|Asila]]) and Tangier were captured from the Moors. Under [[John II of Portugal|John II]] (1481<U+2013>1495) the fortress of [[Elmina|S<U+00E3>o Jorge da Mina]], the modern Elmina, was founded  for the protection of the Guinea trade. [[Diogo C<U+00E3>o]], or Can, discovered the [[Congo Basin|Congo]] in 1482 and reached [[Cape Cross]] in 1486; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] doubled the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, thus proving that the [[Indian Ocean]] was accessible by sea. After 1492 the discovery of the [[West Indies]] by [[Christopher Columbus]] rendered desirable a [[boundary delimitation|delimitation]] of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. This was accomplished by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (June 7, 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in two [[papal bull|bulls]] issued on May 4, 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a straight line drawn from the [[Arctic]] Pole to the [[Antarctic]], at a distance of 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of Cape Verde. Spain received the lands discovered west of this line. As, however, the known means of measuring [[longitude]] were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined (see J. de Andrade Corvo in ''Journal das Ci<U+00EA>ncias Matem<U+00E1>ticas,'' xxxi.147-176, Lisbon, 1881), the treaty was subject to very diverse interpretations. On its provisions were based both the Portuguese claim to [[Brazil]] and the Spanish claim to the [[Moluccas]] (see [[East Indies#History]]). The treaty was chiefly valuable to the Portuguese as a recognition of the prestige they had acquired. That prestige was enormously enhanced when, in 1497-1499, [[Vasco da Gama]] completed the voyage to India. 

Columbus' discovery of what they thought was [[India]] at that time, is something that historians dispute in terms of the consequences that lead to this discovery. One theory which has some support, due to recent proof that has come to light, is that Columbus was indeed Portuguese as stated initially, but he was a spy from the Portuguese kingdom sent to Spain to redirect Spain's efforts elsewhere than the territories Portugal had its focus on. However, this is controversial. Actions such as this would come as no surprise, though, since competition between the two kingdoms was intense and both had their [[secret service]] networks which were in constant conflict with one another, by providing misleading information and in hiding territories and trade routes discovered by each country (but especially Portugal) by either keeping them concealed or by providing false dates and also false locations. This constant secrecy effort was what led to the creation of many "false" documents and thus many of the remaining documents from that time may not be reliable. As a consequence some historians believe that territories such as Brazil, several African locations along its coastline and north America (due to the voyages made westward) may have been discovered before the known dates.

==Afonsine Ordinances==
While the Crown was thus acquiring new possessions, its authority in Portugal was temporarily overshadowed by the growth of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege. After the death of Edward, further attempts to curb the power of the nobles were made by his brother, [[Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra|D. Pedro, duke of Coimbra]], who acted as [[regent]] during the minority of [[Afonso V of Portugal]] (1438<U+2013>1447). The head of the aristocratic opposition was the [[Duke of Braganza]], who contrived to secure the sympathy of the king and the dismissal of the regent. The quarrel led to civil war, and in May 1449, D. Pedro was defeated and killed. Thenceforward the grants made by [[John I of Portugal|John I]] were renewed, and extended on so lavish a scale that the Braganza estates alone comprised about a third of the whole kingdom. An unwise foreign policy simultaneously injured the royal prestige, for Afonso married his own niece, [[Joan, Princess of Castile|Joanna]], daughter of [[Henry IV of Castile]], and claimed the kingdom in her name. At the [[Battle of Toro]], in 1476, he was defeated by [[Ferdinand and Isabella]], and in 1478 he was compelled to sign the [[Treaty of Alcantara]], by which Joanna was relegated to a [[convent]]. His successor, John II (1481<U+2013>1495) reverted to the policy of matrimonial alliances with Castile and friendship with [[England]]. Finding, as he said, that the liberality of former kings had left the Crown "no estates except the high roads of Portugal," he determined to crush the [[feudal]] nobility and seize its territories. A ''[[parliament|cortes]]'' held at [[<U+00C9>vora]] (1481) empowered judges nominated by the Crown to administer justice in all feudal domains. The nobles resisted this infringement of their rights; but their leader, [[Fernando II, Duke of Braganza]], was beheaded for high treason in 1483; in 1484 the king stabbed to death his own brother-in-law, [[Diogo, Duke of Viseu]]; and eighty other members of the aristocracy were afterwards executed. Thus John "the Perfect," as he was called, assured the supremacy of the Crown. He was succeeded in 1495 by [[Manuel I of Portugal|Emanuel (Manuel) I]], who was named "the Great" or "the Fortunate," because in his reign the sea route to India was discovered and a Portuguese Empire founded.

==Portuguese in Asia==
The effort to colonize and maintain territories scattered around the entire coast of Africa and its surrounding islands, Brazil, the Indies and Indic territories such as in [[Malaysia]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Timor]] was a challenge for a population of only one million.
Combined with constant competition from the [[Spain|Spanish]] this led to a desire for [[secrecy]] about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other [[Europe]]an countries were in fact fake documents with fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. 

==Archival Material==
The tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many [[primary sources]]. Several historians have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of [[Brazil]] and [[North America]] as early as 1480 thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon. Unfortunately, due to the fire following the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake of 1755]], nearly all of the library's records were destroyed{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}, but an extra copy available in Goa, was transferred to Lisbon Tower of Tombo, during the following 100 years.  The Corpo Cronol<U+00F3>gico (Chronological Corpus), a collection of manuscripts on the Portuguese explorations and discoveries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, was inscribed on [[UNESCO]]<U+2019>s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2007 in recognition of its historical value "for acquiring knowledge of the political, diplomatic, military, economic and religious history of numerous countries at the time of the Portuguese Discoveries."<ref name=mow>{{cite web|title= Corpo Cronol<U+00F3>gico (Collection of Manuscripts on the Portuguese Discoveries) |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22297&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-14}}</ref>
