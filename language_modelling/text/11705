According to Israeli sources, the information Yousef supplied prevented dozens of [[suicide attacks]] and assassinations of Israelis, exposed numerous Hamas cells,<ref name="h24" /> and assisted Israel in hunting down many militants, including his own father.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com">{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35651699/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/t/hamas-leader-disowns-son/ |title=Hamas leader disowns son - World news - Mideast/N.

According to Yousef, when he was growing up he wanted to be a fighter because that was expected of Palestinian children in the West Bank.<ref name="cnn-transcript">{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1003/02/ampr.01.html|title=An Israeli-Hamas Double Agent Speaks about Career in Intelligence|date=March 2, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}</ref> Yousef was first arrested when he was ten, during the [[First Intifada]], for throwing rocks at Israeli settlers.<ref name="cnn-transcript" /> He was further arrested and jailed by the Israelis numerous times.<ref name="az" /> As his father's eldest son, he was seen as his heir apparent<ref name="dt08" /> and became an important part of the Hamas organization.<ref name="az" /> Yousef claims that his doubts about Islam and Hamas began forming when he realized Hamas' brutality, and that he hated how Hamas used the lives of suffering civilians and children to achieve their goals.<ref name="dt08" /> Yousef was held by [[Shin Bet]] agents in 1996. He claims that while in prison, he was shocked by Shin Bet's interrogation methods, which he considered humane, when compared to how Hamas operatives tortured imprisoned suspected collaborators.<ref>{{cite news |author=Christiane Amanpour |date=March 2, 2010 |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1003/02/ampr.01.html | publisher=CNN | title=An Israeli-Hamas Double Agent Speaks about Career in Intelligence |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref> He decided to accept a Shin Bet approach to become an informant.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gonen ben Yitzhak |author2=Mosab Hassan Yousef |date=June 30, 2010 |url=http://sonofhamas.wordpress.com/2010/07/10/the-heart-of-the-matter/ |title=Why Deport a Friend to Middle East Peace? |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref>

==Espionage career==
Beginning with his release from prison in 1997, Yousef was considered the Shin Bet's most reliable source in the Hamas leadership, earning himself the nickname the "Green Prince" <U+2013> using the color of the Islamist group's flag, and "prince" because of his pedigree as the son of one of the movement's founders. The intelligence he supplied Israel led to the exposure of a number of Hamas cells as well as the prevention of dozens of suicide bombings and assassination attempts on Israeli figures. He has claimed that he did not inform for money but rather that his motivations were ideological and religious, and that he only wanted to save lives.<ref name="dt">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7332932/I-saved-Shimon-Peres-from-plot-says-son-of-Hamas-founder.html|title='I saved Shimon Peres from plot' says son of Hamas founder|last=Sherwell|first=Philip |author2=Nick Allen |date=February 27, 2010|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=March 7, 2010|location=London}}</ref> In order to thwart any suspicions of collaboration, the Shin Bet staged an arrest attempt, telling the [[Israel Defense Forces]] to launch an operation to arrest him, and then provided him intelligence allowing him to escape at the last minute, after which he went into hiding for the rest of his career.

Yousef says he supplied intelligence only on the condition that the "targets" would not be killed, but arrested. This led to the detention of several key Palestinian leaders, including Ibrahim Hamid, a Hamas commander in the West Bank, and [[Marwan Barghouti]]. Also, Yousef claims to have thwarted a 2001 plot to assassinate [[Shimon Peres]], then [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel|foreign minister]] and former [[President of Israel]]. "Many people owe him their lives and don't even know it," says his former Shin Bet officer.<ref name="dt"/>

==Conversion to Christianity==
In 1999, Yousef met a British missionary who introduced him to Christianity.<ref name="dt08" /> Between the years 1999 and 2000, Yousef gradually embraced Christianity. In 2005, he was secretly baptized in [[Tel Aviv]] by a Christian tourist. He left the West Bank for the United States in 2007 and lived some time in [[San Diego]], [[California]], where he joined the Barabbas Road Church.<ref name="dt08" />

In August 2008, Yousef publicly revealed his Christianity and renounced Hamas and the Arab leadership, thereby endangering himself and exposing his family in Ramallah to persecution.<ref name="dt08" /> Yousef has also claimed that his aim was to bring peace to the Middle East. He still hopes to return to Israel when there is peace.<ref name="dt08" />

Mosab has stated that despite his conversion to Christianity, he is against religion and does not adhere to any [[Christian denomination|denomination]] of Christianity. He has stated "Religion steals freedom, kills creativity, turns us into slaves and against one another. Yes, I am talking about Christianity as well as Islam. Most Christians I have seen seem to have missed the point that Jesus redeemed us from religion. Religion is nothing but man's attempts to get back to God. Whether it is Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, animism, any ism. Religion can't save mankind. Only Jesus could save mankind through his death and resurrection. And Jesus is the only way to God."<ref>{{cite web |author=Mosab Hassan Yousef |url=http://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/1246151-let-s-get-to-know-each-other-let-s-talk |title=Let's get to know each other, let's talk . . . |publisher=Goodreads |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Autobiography==
Yousef's autobiography, ''Son of Hamas: A Gripping Account of Terror, Betrayal, Political Intrigue, and Unthinkable Choices'', written with the assistance of Ron Brackin, was published in March 2010.<ref name="h24">{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/haaretz-exclusive-hamas-founder-s-son-worked-for-shin-bet-for-years-1.266204 |title=Haaretz exclusive: Hamas founder's son worked for Shin Bet for years |last=Issacharoff|first=Avi|date=February 24, 2010|newspaper=Haaretz|accessdate=July 28, 2014 }}</ref><ref name="h-harel">{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/when-palestinians-keep-israelis-safe-1.266192 |title=When Palestinians keep Israelis safe |last=Harel |first=Amos |date=February 24, 2010 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

Yousef's brother Ouwais denounced the report about his brother's activities, saying: "It was full of lies &ndash; it's all lies". He also revealed that the last contact between his family and Mosab took place over a year before the news of his spying.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/02/24/israel.hamas.informant/|title=Report: Hamas founder's son worked for Israel|last=Flower|first=Kevin|date=March 3, 2010|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Sheikh Hassan Yousef, Mosab's father, while in an Israeli prison, disowned his son for spying for Israel.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com"/> The ''[[Haaretz]]'' report on Yousef was described by Hamas MP Mushir al-Masri as "psychological war being waged against the Palestinian people...[it] did not deserve a response".<ref name=cnn/>

==Deportation and political asylum==
For a time, Mosab Hassan Yousef was threatened with [[deportation]] from the U.S. after his request for [[Asylum in the United States|political asylum]] was denied, since statements in his book about working for Hamas were interpreted as "[[Providing material support for terrorism|providing material support]] to a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|U.S.-designated terrorist organization]]", despite Yousef's explanation that they were "intended to undermine the group". His case then proceeded to the deportation stage, despite Yousef's advocates warning that he would likely be executed by the [[Palestinian Authority]] if deported to the [[West Bank]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Leila |first=Hilary |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?ID=179493 |title=Israel informant risks deportation |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref>

On June 24, 2010, Shin Bet handler Gonen Ben-Itzhak, who for 10 years worked with Mosab Hassan Yousef under the [[cryptonym]] "Loai", revealed his own identity in order to testify on behalf of Yousef at an immigration hearing in [[San Diego]]. Itzhak described Yousef as a "true friend" and said "he risked his life every day in order to prevent violence".<ref>{{cite web |author=Mosab Hassan Yousef |url=http://sonofhamas.wordpress.com/2010/05/14/shin-bet-handler-confirms-son-of-hamas-account/ |title=Shin Bet "handler" confirms Son of Hamas account! |publisher=Son of Hamas |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Issacharoff |first=Avi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/haaretz-exclusive-hamas-founder-s-son-worked-for-shin-bet-for-years-1.266204 |title=Haaretz exclusive: Hamas founder's son worked for Shin Bet for years |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref>

Partially as a result of this, [[Executive Office for Immigration Review|Immigration Court]] Judge Richard J. Bartolomei, Jr. ruled, on June 30, 2010, that Yousef will be allowed to remain in the United States after he is fingerprinted and passes a routine background check.<ref name="asylum-granted">{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jun/30/hamas-founders-son-granted-asylum-san-diego/|title='Son of Hamas' wins asylum fight|last=Darc<U+00E9>|first=Keith|date=June 30, 2010|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego|San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>

==Films==
Yousef is collaborating with Israeli producer Sam Feuer,and Dennis Baker, Exec. Producer, in the production of two films: a feature film adaptation of Yousef's book ''Son of Hamas'', and a historical depiction of the life of the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]] based on the accounts of eighth-century historian [[Ibn Ishaq]].<ref>{{cite news |author= Melanie Lidman |date=June 20, 2012 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=274511 |title=Former Hamas man to 'tell truth' about Muhammad |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=June 21, 2012 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref>

A documentary adaptation of ''Son of Hamas'' titled ''The Green Prince'', directed and written by Nadav Schirman premiered at the 2014 [[Sundance Film Festival]], <ref>{{cite news |author=Tatiana Siegel |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sundance-film-festival-unveils-2014-662009 |title=Sundance Film Festival Unveils 2014 Competition Lineup |newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> where it won the Audience Award for World Cinema: Documentary.
