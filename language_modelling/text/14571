'''''Mister Mosquito''''', spelled '''''Mr. Moskeeto''''' in [[PAL region]]s and known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Ka'''''|<U+868A>||lit. "Mosquito"}}, is a [[video game]] developed by [[Zoom (company)|ZOOM Inc.]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2) [[video game console]]. The game was first released in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] on June 21, 2001 and the following March in other territories as part of the [[Eidos Interactive]] "Fresh Games" label.

The player controls a [[mosquito]] named "Mister Mosquito", the game's titular hero, who has taken up residency in the house of the Yamada family, life-sized humans that serve as the protagonist's food source in the game. The goal of the game is to stock up on [[blood]] through the summer so that the mosquito will [[Hibernation|survive the winter]] ahead. The player is tasked with sucking blood from specific body parts of the family members without being noticed. If the player is not careful, the human will become stressed and eventually attack.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay revolves around one thing: sucking blood from the Yamada family while they go about their everyday business. However, the player can only suck from a designated body area which will only be available at specific times. Each family member follows a set looping pattern of movements. By following these movements, the player must fill a quota of blood for each stage. The challenge in bloodsucking is that each victim has a "stress meter".  The player must make sure that the victim stays unaware. Sucking too fast or too slow will increase the victim's stress level. If Mister Mosquito is swatted while sucking blood, instant death occurs. If the player is noticed by a victim while flying around, Battle Mode begins, involved like boss battle. The victim tries to attack Mister Mosquito through various means. To calm them, the player must hit a number of [[pressure point]]s, relieving them of tension. Once they are relaxed enough, they return to their business.

The game is made up of a series of [[Level (video gaming)|stages]] which must be unlocked in order by completing each previous stage. Players can choose their own path though each stage. At the start of each stage is a briefing detailing the room where the stage takes place, the victim and area(s) on their body from which blood can be sucked, and any prevalent dangers. The rooms in each stage are fully explorable. Each room has items hidden in obscure places which can bring various benefits.

==Development==
''Mister Mosquito'' was first announced in March 2001 just prior to the [[Tokyo Game Show]]. The tentative title of the game was {{nihongo|''Ka: Yamada-ke No Natsu''|<U+868A> <U+FF5E><U+5C71><U+7530><U+5BB6><U+306E><U+590F><U+FF5E>||lit.

==Reception and legacy==

In 2008, ''[[Game Informer]]'' named ''Mister Mosquito'' one of "The Top Ten Weirdest Games of All Time".<ref>{{cite journal | author=''Game Informer'' staff|journal=[[Game Informer]] | publisher=[[GameStop|GameStop Corporation]] | title=The Top 10 Weirdest Games of All Time | issue=180 | date=April 2008| page=p. 28 | issn=1067-6392}}</ref>  The game was also included by [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] on its own list of weird games.<ref>{{cite web | author=Zivalich, Nicole | date=December 22, 2010 | title=Strange Games: Video Games That We Can't Believe Exist | url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/709321/strange-games-video-games-that-we-cant-believe-exist/ | publisher=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> [[GamesRadar]] included ''Mister Mosquito'' on its list of "The Top 7... games that are cheaper than therapy" as a cure for [[entomophobia]] and on its list of "Rubbish animals that got turned into video game heroes".
