Alcide Laurin was an ice hockey player, who played for an Ontario Based team in Alexandria. On February 24th, 1905, Laurin was beaten to death by 24 year old Allan Loney, a player on a rival team from Maxville Ontario. Laurin took a shot in the chin, followed by a blow to the left temple from Loney's stick. Soon after the incident Laurin, only 19 years old at the time, was pronounced dead on the ice. Loney, a player who was infamous for his brutal on-ice violence, was charged with murder, which was later changed manslaughter.

On March 29th, after 5 hours tedious deliberation, the Jury acquitted Loney after defense witnesses testified and claimed the blow to Laurin was either instinctive or was self-defense. All charges were dropped and the case was dismissed.

The Maxville-Alexandria rivalry was based around opposing religious beliefs held by both sides. The Alexandria side of the rivalry was made up of Catholic French Canadians, contrary to the anglophone and Protestant beliefs of the Maxville population.
