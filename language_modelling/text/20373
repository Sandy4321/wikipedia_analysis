The '''''America''''' was a passenger and package delivery ship built in 1898; it was sunk in Washington Harbor off the shore of [[Isle Royale]] in [[Lake Superior]] in 1928 and the remains are still on the lake bottom.  The wreck was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name="nris"/>


==History==
The ''America'' (Official No. 107367)<ref name = "st">{{cite web | title = America Shipwreck | publisher = Superior Shipwrecks | url = http://www.superiortrips.com/America_Shipwreck.htm | accessdate = December 10, 2010}}</ref> was a steel-hulled ship, built by the [[Detroit Dry Dock Company]] and launched on April 2, 1898.<ref name = "underwater">{{cite | title = Submerged Cultural Resources Study: Isle Royale National Park | author1 = Daniel Lenihan | author2 = Toni Carrell | author3 = Thom Holden | author4 = C. Patrick Labadie | author5 = Larry Murphy | author6 = Ken Vrana | editor = Daniel Lenihan | year = 1987 | publisher = Southwest Cultural Resources Center | pages = 127-152, 285-294 | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/isro/isro.pdf}}</ref>  The ship was 184 feet long, 31 feet wide, and 11 feet in depth.<ref name = "underwater"/> She had a gross tonnage of 486 tons and a net of 283 tons.<ref name = "underwater"/>  She was powered by a triple expansion steam engine and two [[Scotch boiler]]s, manufactured by the Dry Dock Engine Works, delivering 700HP.<ref name = "underwater"/>

Less than a month after her launch, the ''America'' began a daily run, transporting both passengers and packages on [[Lake Michigan]] between [[Chicago]] and [[Michigan City, Indiana]].<ref name = "underwater"/><ref name = "nom">{{cite | title = NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES INVENTORY - NOMINATION FORM: Shipwrecks of Isle Royale National Park Thematic Group| author = Toni Carrell | date = September 1983 | url = http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64000334.pdf}}</ref>  The ship remained on this run until 1901; in 1902 she was purchased by the Booth Steamship Company and treansferred to service in [[Lake Superior]].<ref name = "nom"/><ref name = "underwater"/>  There, the ship served as a communications link for the western portion of Lake Superior, running three voyages per week among [[Duluth, Minnesota]], Isle Royale, and [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]] and numerous small communities in between.<ref name = "st"/> The ship carried supplies in and fish catch out, as well as moving both mail and passengers.<ref name = "st"/>

The ''America'' had a number of accidents; the first one barely two weeks after she arrived in Duluth, when the ship ran into an ice floe and stove in her bow.<ref name = "underwater"/>  In 1904, ran too close to another steamer, destroying 5 staterooms, and in 1909 she ran aground.<ref name = "underwater"/>  

In 1909, the Booth Steamship Company failed and a new company, the Booth Fisheries Company, took over operation of the failed company's assets, including the ''America''.<ref name = "underwater"/>  In 1911, the ''America'' was lengthened to 183 feet, increasing the gross and net tonnages to 937 tons and 593 tons, respectively.<ref name = "underwater"/><ref name = "irnp">{{cite web | title = Scuba Diving | publisher = Isle Royal National Park, National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/scuba-diving.htm | accessdate = December 10, 2010}}</ref>  The beam and depth remained the same.  The rework added 12 more staterooms, bringing the total to 51, of which 43 wre reserved fro passengers.<ref name = "underwater"/> In 1914, management of the ship was taken over by the United Stated & Dominion Transportation Company, a subsidiary of Booth.<ref name = "underwater"/>

Also in 1914, the ''America'' again ran aground, taking considerable damage.<ref name = "underwater"/>  In 1926, it collided with another stramer, and in 1927 rammed the dock and grounded while coming into port.<ref name = "underwater"/>

==The wreck of the ''America''==
[[File:AmericaMooring.jpg|left|thumb|Mooring at the ''America'']]
[[File:AmericaWreck1.jpg|left|thumb|The ''America'' from above]]
On June 6, 1928, the ''America'' steamed out of Duluth on its normal route.<ref name = "underwater"/>  It arrived in Isle Royale's Washington Harbor in the early morning hours of June 7 to drop off passengers, and left again before dawn.<ref name = "underwater"/>  Once the ship had cleared the dock, the captain turned over the helm to the first mate.<ref name = "underwater"/>  Five minutes later, the ''America'' hit a submerged reef as she was leaving Washington Harbor.<ref name = "st"/><ref name = "underwater"/>  Although the captain returned to the helm and attempted to beach her, the ''America'' ran aground on a second reef.<ref name = "st"/>  All 16 passengers and 31 crew aboard<ref name = "underwater"/> were successfully transported to lifeboats.<ref name = "st"/>  Within an hour, the ''America'' slowly settled to the bottom in the north gap of Washington Harbor, leaving only its forward deck and wheelhouse above the waterline.<ref name = "st"/><ref name = "underwater"/>

Efforts were made to re-float the ship, but the bidding process was delayed, and a salvage company was not lined up until 1929.<ref name = "underwater"/>  Over the winter of 1928-29, the wheelhouse was sheared off and the ship was shifted by the ice to sit lower in the water.<ref name = "underwater"/> By that time, it was thought that raising the wreck would not be financially feasible, and indeed, the salvage company was never able to rain the capital required to raise the wreck.<ref name = "underwater"/>  

A group of divers in the 1960's attempted to raise the ''America'' and bring her to Duluth for service as a museum ship.<ref name = "st"/>  However, this later attempt was also unsuccessful due to Lake Superior storms and, it was rumored, sabotage by a diver who wanted the ''America'' to stay where she was.<ref name = "st"/>

==The wreck today==
The ''America'' lies along a steep underwater cliff, with the wreckage as deep as 85 feet as shallow as only two feet to the surface,<ref name = "irnp"/> and can be easily seen by visitors arriving in Washington Harbor.<ref name = "st"/>  The hull is completely intact, as are the belowdeck cabins and teh stern.<ref name = "st"/> The forward part of the superstructure is missing due to the elements and salvage operations.<ref name = "irnp"/><ref name = "npsap"/>  The effects of winter ice can be seen as far down as 30 feet below the surface, and alterations to the vessel from earlier salvage attempts are apparent.<ref name = "underwater"/>

The ''America'' is one of the most popular wrecks for diving in [[Isle Royale National Park]],<ref name = "nom"/> with over 200 dives in 2009 out of 1062 dives made to wrecks in the park.<ref name = "green">{{cite | title = A Diver<U+2019>s Experience | author = Pete Sweger | periodical = The Greenstone 2010 | date = 2010 | page = 9 | url = http://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/upload/Greenstone_2010.pdf}}</ref>  The pressure from the number of dives and the lake motion near the surface has caused the wreck to deteriorate.<ref name = "st"/>  Nearly all portable objects have been stripped from the wreck by souvenir-hunting divers.<ref name = "underwater"/>  The Isle Royale National Park has formed an informal partnership with the Great Lakes Shipwreck Preservation Society (GLSPS) to preserve and monitor the ''America''.<ref name = "npsap">{{cite web | title = NPS Investigates Sunken Ships in Isle Royale NP | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/archeology/sites/npsites/IsleRoyale.htm | accessdate = December 14, 2010}}</ref> In 1996, the GLSPS repaired one of the ship's walls, and they have reattached other pieces and otherwise worked to stabilize the ship.<ref name = "npsap"/>
