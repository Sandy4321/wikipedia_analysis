'''''The Ultimate Fighter''''' is an American [[reality television]] series and [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) competition produced by the [[FX (TV channel)|FX Network]] and the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC)<ref name="MMAWeekly.com">{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/its-official-ufc-and-fox-are-now-in-business-together |title= It<U+2019>s Official: UFC and Fox Are Now in Business Together |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=2011-08-18 |accessdate=011-08-18}}</ref>. It previously aired for fourteen seasons on [[Spike TV]]. The show features professional MMA fighters living together in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], and follows them as they train and compete against each other for a prized contract with the UFC. The series debuted on January 17, 2005, with its first episode, "[[The_Ultimate_Fighter_1#Episodes|The Quest Begins]]". To date, there have been fourteen seasons of the show, two per calendar year; the fifteenth began airing in March 2012. Each season features either one or two weight classes in the tournament.     

The historic [[Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar]] fight in the first season drew millions of viewers to the show and launched the sport into the mainstream.  Because of this success, ''The Ultimate Fighter'' was regarded as instrumental to the survival and expansion of the UFC. Many current and past UFC fighters are alumni of the show, with some competitors going on to become coaches in future seasons. The show has undergone multiple format changes since its inception, including the introduction of the wildcard bout. Many winners have gone on to compete for UFC championships with some becoming UFC champions.

==History==
[[File:Dana White headshot.jpg|thumb|120px|Dana White, the UFC president, oversees each season]]
''The Ultimate Fighter'' was originally an experimental series financed by the owners of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), [[Lorenzo Fertitta|Lorenzo]] and [[Frank Fertitta III]]. The series was aired on [[Spike TV]] for free as a last resort measure to gain mainstream exposure for [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA).<ref name="reunion">{{cite web|last=Iole|first=Kevin|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRtXWN1X|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/5178/the-ultimate-fighter-1-reunion-recap.mma|title=The Ultimate Fighter 1 reunion recap|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=April 31, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> Airing after [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s flagship show [[Monday Night RAW]], ''The Ultimate Fighter'''s debut episode was able to garner a 57% retention rate in viewers from ''RAW'', which was double the usual rate for Spike TV.<ref>{{cite web|author=Multi Channel News Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRthww2A|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/85966-Spike_s_Ultimate_Fighter_Pins_Ratings.php|title=Spike<U+2019>s Ultimate Fighter Pins Ratings|publisher=''[[NewBay Media]]''|work=Multi Channel News|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=January 20, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> The [[The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale|live finale]] for the first season saw the historic bout of [[Forrest Griffin vs. Stephan Bonnar]].

If it weren't for what these guys did, I don't know if there would even be a UFC. I'll never forget these guys. Ever."<ref name="reunion" />

The renewal of the show saw UFC produce two more series, before subsequent renewals. In order to garner more attention for the sport, ''The Ultimate Fighter''  utilizes gimmicks: one notable example, in the ninth season, employed a country vs. country theme, with the United States competing against the  United Kingdom. These gimmicks enabled the UFC to appeal to fans that had been recently introduced to the sport during UFCs penetration into the European market.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=MMAjunkie.com Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uSFBAeNz|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/15465/future-season-of-the-ultimate-fighter-could-feature-a-team-mexico.mma|title=Future season of The Ultimate Fighter could feature a Team Mexico|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> ''The Ultimate Fighter'' also drew record viewing figures for Spike TV when YouTube sensation [[Kimbo Slice]] participated in the tenth season.

In August 2011, after a very successful run on Spike and with the upcoming announcement of the UFC's new relationship with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], Spike officials made a statement regarding the end of their partnership with the UFC: <U+201C>''The Ultimate Fighter'' season 14 in September will be our last... Our 6-year partnership with the UFC has been incredibly beneficial in building both our brands, and we wish them all the best in the future.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/spike-tv-announces-partnership-with-the-ufc-has-ended-tuf-14-will-be-the-last-on-the-network |title= Spike TV Announces Partnership with the UFC Has Ended, TUF 14 Will Be the Last on the |work= MMAWeekly.com] |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Selection process==
===Seasons 1<U+2013>4===
[[Image:TUF Bracket Screenshot.jpg|right|thumb|450px|The Ultimate Fighter uses an elimination tournament format, as highlighted by the series ten bracket.]]

For the first four seasons, prospect UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams,<ref name="teams">{{cite web|last=Stupp|first=Dann|authorlink=Dann Stupp|archiveurl=
http://www.webcitation.org/5uRIDvBlb|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/16162/the-ultimate-fighter-heavyweights-season-debut-re-sparks-once-struggling-series.mma|title=The Ultimate Fighter Heavyweights season debut re-sparks once struggling series|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> irrespective of weight class, with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|archiveurl=
http://www.webcitation.org/5uRKNmY09|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/18926/episode-no-5-recap-the-ultimate-fighter-11-team-liddell-vs-team-ortiz.mma|title=Episode No. 5 recap: "The Ultimate Fighter 11: Team Liddell vs. Team Ortiz|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

At the end of a season, the two remaining fighters of each weight class are placed in a single-elimination fight at ''Ultimate Fighter Finales'', such as ''[[The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale]]''  where the title of Ultimate Fighter is awarded to the winner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Scott|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRKnYkvY|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-the-Ultimate-Fighter-Finale-2652|title=Sherdog.com's Guide to The Ultimate Fighter|publisher=''[[Sherdog]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> Seasons five to seven and ten to twelve have featured fighters from just one weight class each, with the other seasons focusing on two weight classes.

The show features the daily preparations each fighter makes to train for competition at the UFC training center,<ref name="teams" /> and the interactions they have with each other living under the same roof. Day-to-day events on the show are overseen by UFC president [[Dana White]].<ref>{{cite web|author=MMAjunkie.com Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRL2dnIG|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/14260/spike-tv-announces-april-6-open-tryout-for-tuf-10.mma|title=Spike TV announces April 6 open tryout for TUF 10|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref>

With the exception of the season finales, fights on ''The Ultimate Fighter'' are sanctioned by the [[Nevada Athletic Commission]] as exhibition matches and do not count for or against a fighter's professional record.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trembow|first=Ivan|archiveurl=
http://www.webcitation.org/5uRM8loDO| url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-68-fighter-salaries|title=UFC 68 fighter salaries|publisher=''MMA Weekly''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=March 6, 2007|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> This is done to keep the results from going public before the air date. However, going into the semi-final stage of each series, fights are scheduled for the full professional three rounds, as opposed to two rounds (with the possibility of a sudden victory round) for all stages prior.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stupp|first=Dann|authorlink=Dann Stupp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRoRciQs|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19466/episode-no-11-recap-the-ultimate-fighter-11-team-liddell-vs-team-ortiz.mma|title=Episode No. 11 recap: "The Ultimate Fighter 11: Team Liddell vs. Team Ortiz"|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=June 9, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> Though officially exhibition fights, the UFC chooses to record the results of semi-final matchups. For example, the seventh season winner [[Amir Sadollah]] has one more win on his UFC record<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ufc.com/fighter/Amir_Sadollah|title=Amir Sadollah (UFC Profile)|publisher=''[[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]''|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref> than on his official record<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRLjE4VR|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Amir-Sadollah-34071|title=Amir Sadollah (Sherdog profile)|publisher=''[[Sherdog]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|year=2010|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> due to his victory in his season's semi-final round.

===Changes===

The first six seasons featured sixteen fighters, in either one or two weight categories.<ref name="TUF7change">{{cite web|last=Stupp|first=Dann|authorlink=Dann Stupp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRoq48vQ|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/4066/the-ultimate-fighter-7---episode-1-recap.mma|title="The Ultimate Fighter 7" -- Episode 1 recap|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=April 2, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> The first two seasons, however, were very different from each following season. The original format for ''The Ultimate Fighter'' saw each team compete in challenges, such as hoisting their respective coach up on their shoulders and sprinting down a beach,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatefighter.com/videos/tuf-1-chairman-challenge|title=TUF 1: Chairman Challenge|publisher=''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> or a team tug-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatefighter.com/videos/tuf-1-tug-of-war|title=TUF 1: Tug of War|publisher=''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> These challenges resulted in eliminations of fighters who hadn't fought, until late in the season when the challenge incentive was to select the next fight where fighters would be eliminated, having lost the fight. In the first two seasons, fighters would also leave the house for good upon losing and this often resulted in odd numbers for teams, which forced the moving of fighters to opposing teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatefighter.com/videos/tuf-1-getting-chucked|title=TUF 1: Getting Chucked|publisher=''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

Beginning in season four, fighters were no longer removed from the house after losing their fights and did not switch teams except in extraordinary cases, such as being [[Andy Wang|kicked off a team]] by the head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatefighter.com/videos/tuf-5-penn-drops-wang|title=TUF 5: Penn drops Wang|publisher=''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref>  In the seventh season, instead of the usual sixteen fighters, thirty-two fighters participated. This new rule introduced a preliminary fight, in order to get into the house, which gave the coaches an early evaluation.<ref name="TUF7change" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/tv/the-ultimate-fighter-season-7-episode-2|title=The Ultimate Fighter Season 7, Episode 2|publisher=''[[UGO Networks]]''|date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>

The final change to date was the introduction of the "wild card" for seasons 11-13. In seasons 11 & 12, 28 fighters competed in the preliminary round, with the winning fourteen entering the house. A "wild card" bout would take place at the end of the "round-of-fourteen" featuring two of the losing fighters. The winner of the wild card bout would then be included in the quarterfinal round of eight fighters.<ref>{{cite web|author=MMAjunkie.com Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uS0oknyi|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/18131/the-ultimate-fighter-11-cast-unveiled-with-28-middleweight-fighters.mma|title=The Ultimate Fighter 11 cast unveiled with 28 middleweight fighters|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> This format proved highly successful for middleweight fighter [[Kris McCray]], who took part in season 11's wild card bout. Having lost his opening match in the house, he won the wild card bout to reach the quarter finals and went on to win his next two bouts, reaching the tournament final.<ref>{{cite web|author=MMAjunkie.com Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uS0v1PZX|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19563/court-mcgee-vs-kris-mccray-named-main-event-for-the-ultimate-fighter-11-finale.mma|title=Court McGee vs. Kris McCray named main event for The Ultimate Fighter 11 Finale|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 22, 2010|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> The wild card bout was instituted one last time in season 13, which only featured 14 fighters in the house & no preliminary fights.

===Contract award===
The winners of the first three seasons of ''The Ultimate Fighter'' competition, and certain runners-up depending on their performance in their competition finals, receive the touted "six-figure" contract to fight in the UFC. These contracts are specifically three-year contracts with a guaranteed first year.<ref name="contract">{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-ufc-and-joys-of-re.html |title=The UFC and the joys of re-writing history|publisher=ivansblog.com|date=July 19, 2006}}</ref>  Each year consists of three fights, the first year's purse per fight consists of $12,000 guaranteed with a $12,000 win bonus (a maximum of $24,000 per fight). The second year's purse per fight is $16,000 with a $16,000 win bonus (a maximum of $32,000 per fight) and the third year's purse per fight is at $22,000 with a $22,000 win bonus (a maximum of $44,000 per fight).<ref name="contract" />

A TUF winner who goes 9<U+2013>0 can earn $300,000 total on the contract, but only $150,000 is guaranteed for all three years if nine  fights are fought.<ref name="contract" /> Some TUF competitors who did not win the series were also offered UFC contracts, although not on as attractive terms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Josh|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uYGKF9QX|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/TUF-Cast-Puts-on-Show-before-The-Show-2646|title=TUF cast puts on show before the show|publisher=''[[Sherdog]]''|archivedate=November 27, 2010|date=April 9, 2005|accessdate=November 27, 2010}}</ref>

==Coaches involvement==

With the exception of seasons two, four, eleven and thirteen, the coaches fight each other after the conclusion of the show. Season two featured [[Rich Franklin]] and [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], who were in different weight categories, eliminating the possibility for a post-season fight. The fourth season saw multiple guest coaches take the lead, differing from other seasons with two clearly designated coaches.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Scott|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXldi9Il|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-The-Ultimate-Fighter-5344|title=Sherdog.com's Guide to The Ultimate Fighter|publisher=''[[Sherdog]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=August 18, 2006|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> As such, these seasons did not feature their respective coaches in competition. Season eleven coaches [[Tito Ortiz]] and [[Chuck Liddell]]'s fight was cancelled due to Ortiz's need for neck fusion surgery.<ref>{{cite web|authorlink=FanHouse Newswire|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXmG248Q|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2010/06/10/tito-ortiz-talks-neck-surgery-comeback-and-still-wanting-to-fig/|title=Tito Ortiz Talks Neck Surgery, Comeback and Still Wanting to Fight Chuck Liddell|publisher=''[[FanHouse]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> Season thirteen saw the fight between [[Brock Lesnar]] and [[Junior dos Santos]] cancelled after Lesnar was diagnosed with his second bout of [[diverticulitis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=6535275|title=Diverticulitis forces Brock Lesnar out|publisher=sports.espn.com|date=May 14, 2011}}</ref>

In addition to the seasons which did not feature post-season fights between the coaches, several seasons have been impacted, forcing postponements. Due to injuries to the season six coaches [[Matt Serra]] and [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]], their fight was postponed. Serra suffered a herniated disc in his lower back and Hughes later suffered a torn MCL before the fight finally took place at [[UFC 98]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXmnDMMT|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/14936/serras-long-wait-for-hughes-fight-winds-down-as-ufc-98-approaches.mma|title=Serra's long wait for Hughes fight winds down as UFC 98 approaches|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=May 20, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> The fight between season ten coaches [[Rashad Evans]] and [[Quinton Jackson]] took place at [[UFC 114]] with Rashad Evans winning by unanimous decision.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|coauthors=[[Dann Stupp]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXmtdgMz|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/19349/ufc-114-main-card-recap-evans-outclasses-rampage-bisping-dominates-miller.mma|title=UFC 114 main card recap: Evans outclasses "Rampage", Bisping dominates Miller|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=May 30, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> The fight was postponed by five months due to Jackson's [[The A-Team (film)|A-Team]] filming commitments and his temporary decision to retire from fighting.<ref>{{cite web|author=MMAjunkie.com Staff|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXmzbC03|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/16277/quinton-rampage-jackson-im-done-fighting.mma|title=Quinton "Rampage" Jackson: "I'm done fighting"|publisher=''[[MMAjunkie.com]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref>

Though rarely taking place at the live finales, the coaches' fights are an important part of each season of ''The Ultimate Fighter''. With each season effectively hyping the fight and the individuals for multiple weeks,<ref>{{cite web|last=Snowden|first=J. Edward|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uXn9OwqZ|url=http://www.ugo.com/sports/fightin-words-ultimate-fighter|title=Fightin' words - Ultimate Fighter|publisher=''[[UGO Networks]]''|archivedate=November 26, 2010|date=August 7, 2008|accessdate=November 26, 2010}}</ref> the fights are usually the focal point of the pay-per-view event they feature at.

==Season synopses==

The first season of ''The Ultimate Fighter'' was the last attempt by the UFC to capture public interest in the sport. The Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin bout saved the sport according to many journalists and Dana White. Griffin and Sanchez are also regarded as the original Ultimate Fighters, after their wins at the finale.<ref name="TUF1" />  The second season saw welterweights and heavyweights compete, featuring coaches [[Rich Franklin]] and [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]]. The final saw [[Rashad Evans]] defeating [[Brad Imes]] and [[Joe Stevenson]] defeating [[Luke Cummo]].<ref name="TUF2" />  The third season highlighted the long-standing rivalry between [[Tito Ortiz]] and [[Ken Shamrock]].<ref name="TUF3open" /> It was also the first season to feature competitors from outside of North America, after the addition of [[Michael Bisping]] and [[Ross Pointon]]. The season saw a format change, when the team-games were eliminated in favour of a conventional knockout style tournament format.<ref name="TUF3open">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-The-Ultimate-Fighter-4240|title=Sherdog.com's guide to The Ultimate Fighter|publisher=sherdog.com|date=April 7, 2006}}</ref> The final fights saw [[Michael Bisping]] become the first non-American winner, defeating [[Josh Haynes]] and [[Kendall Grove]] defeat [[Ed Herman]].<ref name="TUF3" />  

The fourth season was different to others before it, as it was the "comeback" season. Past UFC fighters who hadn't had the success they were expected to have, were invited back, to compete in the show, with the winner receiving a guaranteed title shot.<ref name="4one">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-The-Ultimate-Fighter-5344|title=Sherdog.com's guide to The Ultimate Fighter|publisher=sherdog.com|date=August 18, 2006}}</ref> This season was also the only one to date to not feature team coaches. Instead, the show had guest coaches each week.<ref name="4one" /> The final saw [[Matt Serra]] defeat [[Chris Lytle]] and [[Travis Lutter]] defeat [[Patrick C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> (fighter)|Patrick C<U+00F4>t<U+00E9>]] to receive their guaranteed title shots.<ref name="TUF4" />  The fifth season was coached by [[Jens Pulver]] and [[BJ Penn]], as the company attempted to kickstart the lightweight division.<ref name="TUF5start">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-TUF-7174|title=Sherdog.com's guide to TUF 5|publisher=sherdog.com|date=April 6, 2007}}</ref> The show featured many of the future stars of the lightweight division such as [[Nate Diaz]], [[Joe Lauzon]], [[Gray Maynard]], [[Matt Wiman]] and [[Cole Miller]].Despite the fact that Team Pulver won 5 out of the first eight fights, the 3 fighters who made it through the quarterfinals on Team Penn are still in the ufc which are [[Gray Maynard]], [[Matt Wiman]] and [[Joe Lauzon]] while [[Cole Miller]], [[Manny Gamburyan]], and [[Nate Diaz]] from Team Pulver are still in the UFC.The final was contested by [[Nate Diaz]] and [[Manny Gamburyan]], with Gamburyan falling to a shoulder injury early on.<ref name="TUF5finale" />  Former winner [[Matt Serra]] returned to the show in the sixth season to coach alongside [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]] and oversaw a group of welterweight fighters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-TUF-6-9123|title=Sherdog.com's guide to TUF 6|publisher=sherdog.com|date=September 20, 2007}}</ref> The final saw veteran [[Mac Danzig]] defeat [[Tommy Speer]] to become ''The Ultimate Fighter'', before he dropped to the lightweight division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/No-Bull-El-Matador-Shines-at-TUF-Finale-10295|title=No bull: El Matador shines at TUF Finale|publisher=sherdog.com|date=December 9, 2007}}</ref> Arguably, only [[George Sotiropoulos]] has gone on to have any success post-TUF and is currently 7-2 in the UFC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Penn-Fitch-Sotiropoulos-Siver-Targeted-for-UFC-127-28306|title=Penn-Fitch, Sotiropoulos-Siver targeted for UFC 127|publisher=sherdog.com|date=November 21, 2010}}</ref> while season winner Danzig is only 4-4 in the UFC and currently 2-4 in his past 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Mac-Danzig-3396|title=Mac Danzig Sherdog record|publisher=sherdog.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref>

The seventh season saw another format change, as fighters had to compete to be official castmembers. Instead of the usual 16 fighters, the season had 32 fighters after Dana White claimed that he was tired of fighters coming onto the show for airtime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-TUF-7-12134|title=Sherdog.com's guide to TUF 7|publisher=sherdog.com|date=April 3, 2008}}</ref> This season was coached by UFC Light Heavyweight champion [[Rampage Jackson]] and challenger [[Forrest Griffin]], the first season's winner. The season's final was due to be competed between [[Amir Sadollah]], who hadn't competed in a professional fight before the show, and [[Jesse Taylor]]. However, Taylor was kicked off the show after filming had completed, when he kicked the window out of a limosine in Las Vegas.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Sherdogcoms-Guide-to-TUF-7-13316|title=Sherdog.com's guide to TUF 7|publisher=sherdog.com|date=June 19, 2008}}</ref> His slot was taken by [[C.B.
