The '''Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service''' (''Marinens Flyvevesen'') was alongside the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] the forerunner to the modern-day [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]].<ref>Official Norwegian Defence Force website: [http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/ History of the Royal Norwegian Air Force] {{no icon}}</ref> 

== History ==
The RNNAS was established on [[1 June]] [[1912]],<ref>Official Norwegian Defence Force website: [http://www.mil.no/luft/start/omlf/historikk/article.jhtml?articleID=14824 The first military flight in Norway] {{no icon}}</ref>  with the maiden flight of the [[HNoMS Start]], piloted by [[Hans Dons]]. The founding of the Air Service was based largely on pride. On [[19 April]] 1912 newspapers had reported that a [[Sweden|Swedish]] pilot was planning to fly over [[Moss, Norway|Moss]] and [[Horten]]. Horten was the site of the main base of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]. Three officers of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[submarine]] [[HNoMS Kobben (A-1)]] decided that it would be a shame if they were not able to beat him to it. 

Later that year, the [[Maurice Farman]] biplanes ''Njaal'' and ''Gange Rolf'' were purchased.

In 1915 the Navy established its own [[Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk|plane factory]] and a pilot school.

The main flight base was established in Horten. Other naval air stations were established in [[Kristiansand]] in 1918, [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] in 1919 and in [[Troms<U+00F8>]] shortly before the [[German invasion of Norway|invasion]] in 1940.

=== World War II ===
==== The Norwegian Campaign ====
[[Image:Heinkel He 115A-2 (He 115N) F.60 of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian [[Heinkel He 115|He 115N]]s in 1939-1940]]
In 1940 most of the planes in Norwegian service were outdated, and the 1 100 transport and figher planes of the [[Luftwaffe]]  soon gained air superiority. The armed resistance in Norway was abandoned [[9 June]] 1940, although some Norwegians would continue the fight abroad. The aircraft of the Norwegian Naval Airforce were the only ones which had the range to fly all the way from the remaining bases in [[Nord-Norge|Northern Norway]] to [[UK|Britain]]. Amongst the Norwegian aircraft which reached Britain were four German made [[Heinkel He 115]] [[sea plane]]s, a fifth escaping to [[Finland]]. Three [[H<U+00F8>ver M.F. 11]] maritime reconnaissance aircraft also made it to Finland, landing on Lake Salmij<U+00E4>rvi in [[Petsamo]] on 8 June. Six He 115s were bought before the war, and another two were captured from the Germans during the [[Norwegian Campaign]]. A captured [[Arado Ar 196]] from the German [[heavy cruiser]] [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|''Admiral Hipper'']] was also flown from Norway to Britain for testing.

==== The RNNAS in exile====

The Army and Navy air forces established themselves in Britain under the command of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. Norwegian air and ground crews operated as part of the British [[Royal Air Force]], both in wholly Norwegian squadrons, and in others. The first exile air unit was the [[No. 330 Squadron RAF|330 Squadron]] equipped with [[Northrop N-3PB|Northrop]] torpedo-bombers. This squadron was established in the autumn of 1940 and was operating from [[Akureyri]], [[Iceland]],  from July 1941. On 28 January 1943 the entire squadron relocated to [[Oban]], [[Scotland]] where it began to re-equip with [[Short Sunderland]]s. The second maritime squadron was the [[No. 333 Squadron RAF|333 squadron]] established in 1943 in [[Woodhaven]], Scotland equipped with [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] sea planes and [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] [[fighter-bomber]]s. At the start of the war, Norwegian personnel received flight training at [[Toronto]], Canada, at a facility now known as [[Toronto City Centre Airport]].  The advantage of this site was its' ability to provide both basic flight and seaplane training.  Although the airport is located on an island in the harbour, personnel were housed in barracks on the mainland, in a neighbourhood which is still known today as [[Little Norway]].  On [[10 May]] [[1945]] the Mosquitos were formed into a third separate squadron - [[No. 334 Squadron RAF|334 Squadron]]. Both planes and running costs were financed by the exiled [[Norway|Norwegian]] government.

== The Royal Norwegian Air Force ==
The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service ceased to exist on [[10 November]] [[1944]] when the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] was established. 

In honour of the achievements of the RNoAF Squadrons of the WWII The Royal Norwegian Air Force has maintained the RAF squadron names. Thus Norway still has 330 and 333 squadrons, respectively flying [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopters and [[P-3 Orion|Orion]] Maritime Patrol Aircraft. 334 Squadron is currently deactivated and is going to reform with [[NHI NH90|NH90]] [[utility helicopter]]s sometime in 2007.
