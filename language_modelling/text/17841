==Plot==
[[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] sells [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] a beer keg for the [[American Civil War]] reenactment of the Battle of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. At the reenactment, [[Principal Skinner]] watches as Springfielders disobey him and hold a rather inaccurate battle (featuring an orange clad "East" faction, a roller skating Stone Wall Jackson, and a [[Wild Wild West|giant robotic spider]] made by [[Professor Frink]]). After the battle, Homer brings the empty, dented keg back to Apu at the [[Kwik-E-Mart]] in an attempt to get the deposit. There, he hears a giggle coming from a closet and finds Apu [[sexual intercourse|making love]] with the woman who delivers Squishees to Kwik-E-Mart. He then walks backwards in shock all the way home to his bed.

[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] figures out what Homer saw from the movements of his pupil. They decide not to tell [[Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon|Manjula]] but while they are playing [[Badminton]] Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu looking at them, trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu and he says he will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu [[adultery|cheating]]. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. Manjula then demands a [[divorce]].

Kicked out, Apu moves into the apartment complex where [[Kirk Van Houten]] lives. The octuplets then speak their first words, which put together, say "Mommy, will you let daddy come back...cookie!" Marge and Manjula go to Apu's and arrive in time to prevent him from hanging himself. Apu is then subjected to several tasks to redeem himself (such as eating a light bulb), though Manjula says it will take time for everything to get back to normal. In bed, Manjula, finally satisfied with what he has done, kisses Apu while Homer watches from the window, on a ladder. The couple continues and Homer, traumatized, hops backwards on the ladder all the way home, without falling, mimicking what he did earlier.

"The Sweetest Apu" was written by former ''Simpsons'' writer [[John Swartzwelder]] and directed by director [[Matthew Nastuk]]. It was first broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on May 5, 2002. After seeing Apu cheating on Manjula with the squishee girl, an extensive scene in which Homer dramatically backs out of the room, into the Simpson house and into his bed is shown. The scene was conceived by episode writer Swartzwelder.<ref name="Jean" /> Another scene in the episode shows Apu breakng up with the Squishee lady in front of her house. Originally, police chief Clancy Wiggum would be seen in a robe inside the house, implying that other men in Springfield cheat on their wives as well, however it was dismissed because the writers thought it would look "too sad."<ref name="Selman">Selman, Matt. (2010). Commentary for "The Sweetest Apu", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Originally, Swartzwelder wanted the kama sutra sex position in the episode to show several arms and legs "sticking out in crazy positions," however it received a censor note and the ''Simpsons'' staff were allowed to show "less and less" of it as time progressed.<ref name="Jean" />

The episode features American writer and actor [[James Lipton]], host of the television program ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', as himself.<ref name="Jean" /> The divorce lawyer was portrayed by series regular voice actor [[Hank Azaria]],<ref name="Castellaneta">Castellaneta, Dan.

Professor Frink's steam-powered "Super-spider" seen during the reenactment is a reference to the 1999 steampunk film ''[[Wild Wild West]]''.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2010).

Following its home video release, "The Sweetest Apu" received mostly negative reviews from critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote "I don<U+2019>t recall ever being particularly excited by other Manjula episodes, and 'Sweetest' does nothing to alter that perception." He praised Homer's reaction to seeing Apu cheating on Manjula, but maintained that "much of the remaining gags tend to be lackluster." He concluded by writing "This ends up as a pretty flat, forgettable show."<ref name="DVDmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthirteen.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season [Blu-Ray] (2001) |date=September 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011|last=Jacobson |first=Colin |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref> Project-Blu's Nate Boss called it "An average episode, by this season's standards," describing it as "a bit too cut and dry for my taste."<ref name="Project-blu">{{cite web|url=http://project-blu.com/reviews/simpsons13.html |title=The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |last=Boss|first=Nate|publisher=Project-Blu}}</ref> Writing for Blu-ray.com, Casey Broadwater wrote that "The Sweetest Apu" is "near-laughless,"<ref name="blu-ray">{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Simpsons-The-Thirteenth-Season-Blu-ray/11327/#Review |title=The Simpsons: The Thirteenth Season Blu-ray Review |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 19, 2011|last=Broadwater |first=Casey |publisher=Blu-ray.com}}</ref> and Ryan Keefer of [[DVD Talk]] wrote "The less said about this episode, the better."<ref name="dvdtalk">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/43599/simpsons-the-complete-thirteenth-season-the/ |title=The Simpsons: The 13th Season (Blu-ray) |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2011|last=Keefer |first=Ryan |publisher=DVD Talk}}</ref> Both reviewers considered the episode to be one of the season's worst.{{#tag:ref|Blu-ray.com's Casey Broadwater wrote, "Thankfully, there are only a few episodes that scrape the bottom of the Simpsons barrel.
