'''''Eragon''''' is the first book in the ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' by [[Christopher Paolini]], who began writing at the age of 15. After writing the first draft for a year, he spent a second year rewriting it and fleshing out the story and characters. Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript and decided to [[Self-publishing|self-publish]] ''Eragon''. Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. By chance, the book was discovered by [[Carl Hiaasen]], who got it re-published by [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.

The book tells the story of a young farm boy named [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. A [[dragon]] he later names [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]] hatches from the stone, which was really an egg. When the evil [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Galbatorix|King Galbatorix]] finds out about Eragon and his dragon, he sends his servants, the Ra'zac, after them in an effort to capture them. Eragon and Saphira are forced to flee from their hometown, and decide to search for the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix.

Critiques of ''Eragon'' often pointed out the similarities to other works such as ''[[Earthsea]]'' and ''[[Dragonlance]]''. Reviews also called the book a notable achievement for such a young author as Paolini. ''Eragon'' was the third-best-selling children's hardback book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 2005. It placed on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Children's Books Best Seller list]] for 121 weeks. ''Eragon'' was adapted into a [[Eragon (film)|feature film of the same name]] that was released on December 15, 2006.

== Background ==

=== Origins and publication ===
[[Christopher Paolini]] started reading fantasy books when he was ten years old. At the age of fourteen, as a hobby, Paolini started writing the first novel in a series of four books, but he could not get beyond a few pages because he had "no idea" where he was going. He began reading everything he could about the "art of writing", and then plotted the whole ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'' book series. After a month of planning out the series, he started writing the draft of ''Eragon'' by hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began writing the "real" version of the book.<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/jan/25/booksforchildrenandteenagers.features|title=Elf and efficiency|last=Spring|first=Kit|date=2004-01-25 |work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> After another year of editing, Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript. They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small, home-based publishing company, Paolini International.<ref name="teenreads"/> Paolini created the cover art for this edition of ''Eragon'', which featured [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]]'s eye on the cover. He also drew the maps inside the book.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paolini|first=Christopher|title=Eragon|publisher=Paolini International LLC|year=2002|isbn=0-9666213-3-6|oclc=49993776}}</ref>

Paolini and his family toured across the United States to promote the book. Over 135 talks were given at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he "would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break&nbsp;<U+2013> and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have gone on for very much longer."<ref name="guardian"/> In the summer of 2002, American novelist [[Carl Hiaasen]] was on vacation in one of the cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, his stepson bought a copy of ''Eragon'' that he "immediately loved".<ref name="guardian"/> He showed it to his stepfather, who brought the book to the attention of the publishing house [[Alfred A. Knopf]]. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish ''Eragon''. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published ''Eragon'' in August 2003. It also led to a new cover, drawn by [[John Jude Palencar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alagaesia.com/christopherpaolini.htm|title=The Author|publisher=Alagaesia.com|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

=== Inspiration and influences ===
[[File:Philip Pullman 2005-04-16.png|alt=A balding man wearing rimless glasses is sitting at a table autographing books. He is wearing a sports coat. A glass of wine and a stack of books are on the table.|thumb|160px|[[Philip Pullman]] in April 2005. Paolini received much inspiration from Philip Pullman, the author of the fantasy book series ''[[His Dark Materials]]''.]]
Paolini cites old [[myth]]s, [[Folklore|folk tales]], medieval stories, the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', and authors [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Eric R<U+00FC>cker Eddison]] as his biggest influences in writing. Other literary influences include [[David Eddings]], [[Andre Norton]], [[Brian Jacques]], [[Anne McCaffrey]], [[Raymond E. Feist]], [[Mervyn Peake]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[Frank Herbert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shurtugal.com/?id=series/christopher/qanda|title=Christopher Paolini Q&A|publisher=Shurtugal.com|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> Paolini has also received inspiration from the two authors [[Philip Pullman]] and [[Garth Nix]]. In ''Eragon'', Paolini "deliberately" included the "archetypal ingredients" of a fantasy book&nbsp;<U+2013> a quest, a journey of experience, revenge, romance, betrayal, and a "special" sword.<ref name="guardian"/>

The ancient language used by the elves in ''Eragon'' is based "almost entirely" on [[Old Norse]], [[German language|German]], [[Old English]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] myth.<ref>Jana Schulman, "Retelling Old Tales: Germanic Myth and Language in Christopher Paolini's ''Eragon''," ''The Year's Work in Medieval-ism'' 25 (2010), 33-41.</ref> Paolini commented that "[I] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. I had a lot of fun with that."<ref name="powells"/> Picking the right name for the characters and places was a process that could take "days, weeks, or even years". Paolini said that "if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself."<ref name="teenreads">{{cite news|url=http://www.teenreads.com/authors/au-paolini-christopher.asp|title=Christopher Paolini interview|last=Saichek|first=Wiley |date=2003-09|publisher=Teenreads.com|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> He added that he was "really lucky" with the name [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], "because it's just dragon with one letter changed." He thought the name fit the book perfectly, but some of the other names caused him "real headaches".<ref name="powells"/>

[[File:Emigrant mountain rivers bend lodge.jpg|alt=A river flows through a flat valley with mountains in the background.|thumb|left|220px|Paolini received inspiration from [[Paradise Valley, Montana]] (''Emigrant Peak pictured, as viewed from west bank of Yellowstone River'')]]The landscape in ''Eragon'' is based on the "wild territory" of Paolini's home state, [[Montana]].<ref name="guardian"/> He said in an interview that "I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description."<ref name="powells"/> Paolini also said that [[Paradise Valley, Montana]] is "one of the main sources" of his inspiration for the landscape in the book. ''Eragon'' takes place in the fictional continent Alaga<U+00EB>sia. Paolini "roughed out" the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.<ref name="powells">{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/authors/paolini.html|title=Philip Pullman, Tamora Pierce, and Christopher Paolini Talk Fantasy Fiction|last=Weich|first=Dave|date=2003-07-31|publisher=[[Powell's Books]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

Paolini chose to have Eragon mature throughout the book because "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation throughout the book "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities as a writer and as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book."<ref name="powells"/> Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as "the perfect friend" by Paolini.<ref name="guardian"/> He decided to go in a more "human direction" with her because she is raised away from her own species, in "close mental contact" with a human. "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race."<ref name="powells"/> Paolini made Saphira the "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud."<ref name="teenreads"/>

== Plot summary ==
The book starts off with a prologue describing an encounter in a forest between a Shade (a sorcerer possessed by evil spirits) and three elves, two male and one female. The Shade, named Durza, with the help of twelve sentient horned humanoids called Urgals, kill the two male elves and capture the female elf, Arya. Before she is captured, Arya magically transports a blue stone she was carrying, which is later revealed to be a Dragon egg, to a mountain range considered dangerous called the Spine.
The action then jumps to [[Eragon (character)|Eragon]], a fifteen-year-old boy who lives with his uncle [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Garrow|Garrow]] and cousin [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Roran Garrowsson|Roran]] on a farm near the village of Carvahall. While hunting in the Spine, Eragon is surprised to see the Blue Dragon egg, which he believes to be a stone, appear in front of him. A few months later, Eragon witnesses a baby Dragon hatch from the egg. Eragon names the Dragon [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Saphira|Saphira]]. He raises the Dragon in secret until two of [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Galbatorix|King Galbatorix]]'s servants, the [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#The Ra'zac|Ra'zac]], come to Carvahall looking for the egg. Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall, so he goes after the Ra'zac, seeking vengeance for the destruction of his home and his uncle's death. He is accompanied by Brom, an elderly storyteller, who provides Eragon with the sword Zar'roc and insists on helping him and Saphira.

Eragon becomes a [[Dragon Rider (Inheritance Cycle)|Dragon Rider]] through his bond with Saphira. Eragon is the only known Rider in Alaga<U+00EB>sia other than Galbatorix, who, with the help of the now-dead Forsworn, killed the Riders a hundred years ago. On the journey, Brom teaches Eragon [[sword fighting]], [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], the ancient language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders.  Their travels bring them to the city of Teirm, where they meet with Brom's friend [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Jeod|Jeod]]. Eragon's fortune is told by the witch [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Angela|Angela]], and her companion, the werecat [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#Solembum|Solembum]], gives Eragon some mysterious advice. With Jeod's help, they are able to track the Ra'zac to the southern city of [[Inheritance_Cycle#Geography|Dras-Leona]]. Although they manage to infiltrate the city, Eragon encounters the Ra'zac in a cathedral and he and Brom are forced to flee. Later that night, their camp is ambushed by the Ra'zac. A stranger named [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Murtagh|Murtagh]] rescues them, but Brom is gravely injured. Saphira suggests to take Brom on one last dragon ride to die with pride as a dragon rider, then soon after, Brom dies.

Murtagh becomes Eragon's new companion and they travel to the city Gil'ead to find information on how to find the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past, her pointed ears are revealed, labeling her an elf. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Durza|Durza]]. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist.

After escaping, Eragon contacts the unconscious elf telepathically, and discovers that her name is [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Arya Dr<U+00F6>ttningu|Arya]]. She tells them that she was poisoned while in captivity and a potion found only with the Varden, the elves, and the King himself can cure her. Arya is able to give directions to the exact location of the Varden: a city called Tronjheim, which sits in the hollow mountain Farthen D<U+00FB>r. She also adds that they have only four days to reach the Varden or she will die. The group go in search of the Varden, both to save Arya's life and to escape Galbatorix's wrath. When they are traveling to the Varden the group notices a huge unit of Urgals following them. The Urgals are revealed to be larger than normal and are called Kull. On the way, Murtagh reveals that he is Morzan's son. 

The Kull reach Eragon right outside the Varden's entrance, but are driven off with the help of the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen D<U+00FB>r. When they arrive in Farthen D<U+00FB>r, Eragon is led to the leader of the Varden, [[Ajihad]]. Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read to determine if he is a friend or a foe to the Varden. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Durza was not destroyed by Murtagh's well placed arrow, because the only way to kill a Shade is with a stab to the heart. [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Orik|Orik]], nephew of the dwarf King [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#Hrothgar|Hrothgar]], is appointed as Eragon and Saphira's guide. Orik shows them a place to stay and introduces them to Hrothgar. Eragon also meets Ajihad's daughter, [[Characters in the Inheritance cycle#Nasuada|Nasuada]], and Ajihad's right hand man, [[Characters_in_the_Inheritance_cycle#J<U+00F6>rmundur|J<U+00F6>rmundur]]. He also runs into Angela and Solembum, who have arrived in Tronjheim, and visits Murtagh in his prison. He is tested by two magicians, [[Characters in the Inheritance Cycle#The Twins|The Twins]], as well as Arya. 

Eragon is at last able to rest, but a new invasion is imminent. As the battle begins, the Varden and the [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] are pitted against an enormous army of Urgals, deployed by Durza and Galbatorix. During the battle, Eragon faces Durza again. Durza, having gravely wounded Eragon's back, is about to capture him but is distracted by Saphira and Arya, who break a large star sapphire Isidar Mithrim on the chamber's ceiling. Durza's attention is diverted long enough for Eragon to stab him in the heart with Zar'roc. After Durza's death, the Urgals are released from a spell which had been placed on them, and begin to fight among themselves. The Varden take advantage of this opportunity to make a counter-attack, forcing off the Urgals. While Eragon is unconscious, someone called 'The Cripple Who Is Whole' contacts him telepathically and tells Eragon to come to him for training in the forest of the elves, Du Weldenvarden.

== Reception ==
''Eragon'' received generally mixed reviews, although it was criticised for its [[derivative]] nature. Liz Rosenberg of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' criticized ''Eragon'' for having "clich<U+00E9>d descriptions", "B-movie dialogue", "awkward and gangly" prose, and a plot that "stumbles and jerks along, with gaps in logic and characters dropped, then suddenly remembered, or new ones invented at the last minute". However, she concluded the review by noting that "for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E1D81539F935A25752C1A9659C8B63|title=The Egg and Him |last=Rosenberg|first=Liz|date=2003-11-16|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> ''[[School Library Journal]]'' wrote that in ''Eragon'' "sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0375826688 |title=Amazon.com Eragon |work=[[School Library Journal]]|date=|author=Rogers, Susan|accessdate=2011-11-09}}</ref> Common Sense Media called ''Eragon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s dialogue "long-winded" and "clich<U+00E9>d", with a plot "straight out of ''[[Star Wars]]'' by way of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there." The website did concede that the book is a notable achievement for such a young author, and that it would be "appreciated" by younger fans.<ref name="Common">{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/Eragon.html|title=Eragon Book Review and Rating|last=Berman|first=Matt|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

Favorable reviews of ''Eragon'' often focused on the book's characters and plot. [[IGN]]'s Matt Casamassina called the book "entertaining", and added that "Paolini demonstrates that he understands how to hold the reader's eyes and this is what ultimately separates ''Eragon'' from countless other me-too fantasy novels."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/495/495881p1.html|title=Book Review: Eragon|last=Casamassina|first=Matt|date=2004-03-01|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> Chris Lawrence of [[About.com]] thought the book had all the "traditional ingredients" that make a fantasy novel "enjoyable". The book was a "fun read" for him because it is "quick and exciting" and "packed" with action and magic. Lawrence concluded his review by giving the book a rating of 3.8/5, commenting that "the characters are interesting, the plot is engrossing, and you know the good guy will win in the end."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contemporarylit.about.com/cs/currentreviews/fr/eragon.htm|title=Eragon (Inheritance, Book 1)|last=Lawrence|first=Chris|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>
