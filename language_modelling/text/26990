== History ==
===Early Years===
Topeka High School was established in 1871 in order to help educate the increasing population of Topeka, Kansas. The original location of the high school was located on the northwest and southwest corners of 8th and Harrison. Topeka High would remain at this location for the next 60 years. In 1928, Topekans voted to issue $1.1 million in bonds to build a new, centrally located high school. The school board hired [[Thomas Williamson]]'s architectural firm to design a new building, and construction started in February 1930. The building was finished in 18 months, and Topeka High School opened its current home in September 1931.<ref name="THS">{{cite web|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/081003/our_ths.shtml|title=Topeka High School: Landmark testimony to history|date=2010-02-08|work=CJ Online|publisher=CJ Online}}</ref> What the voters received for their money that fall -- about $1.75 million after all site costs, equipment and furnishings were calculated -- was a stunning, three-story Gothic building of almost 278,000 square feet. Within that space, in addition to classrooms, were a 165-foot-tall bell tower, multiple stained-glass windows, a gymnasium that seated 4,000, a swimming pool a floor beneath the gymnasium and an auditorium -- illuminated by 10 chandeliers -- that seated 2,400.

The new high school also featured a library with a main reading room measuring 40 feet by 80 feet, a working fireplace, one of four in the building, and a large cafeteria with wood beams, chandeliers and a fireplace. There was a separate faculty dining room. The main hall and stairwells were lined with marble from a Tennessee quarry, and floors in the halls, library and other areas were covered with squares of alternate light and dark tile. Other floors were carpeted or covered with different tile.<ref name="THS"/> Overall, the building has weathered well. The only major structural difference in the building today is the addition of a greenhouse built in the late 1970s

===Recent Years===
In 2005, the 20-yard swimming pool located underneath the gym was converted into Laney Gym, named after former swim coach Chet Laney, for P.E. classes and wrestling. An additional gym was constructed on the soccer field located on the northwest side of the school where JV basketball games and volleyball games are played. Varsity basketball continues to be played in the "Dungeon", the largest high school gymnasium in the state of Kansas, with capacity to accommodate over 5,000 people.<ref name="THS"/> Topeka High celebrated its 150th Anniversary in 2004. Additionally, the school celebrated its 75th Anniversary at its current site on September 17, 2006.

The tall bell tower is the most visible aspect of Topeka High School's architecture. Other notable details include Hoehner auditorium, site of at least one inauguration of a Kansas Governor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  The library was modeled after [[King Henry VIII]]'s palace. Much of the wood shelving in the library is hand-carved, and about half of the ceiling is hand-painted. The original chairs, which are now 75 years old, still remain in the library and efforts are being made to refinish them.

==Traditions==
*'''Running of the halls''':  During first period of days that THS has a home football game, the students gather in the halls of Troy, cheerleaders and the drill team, flag team, and marching band march through the halls to promote school spirit. (Due to inappropriate actions by students and lack of participation, this tradition has been discontinued in recent years, but was brought back during the 2006-2007 school year) The Topeka High Marching Trojans have been a part of the school for years. They travel the country regularly and have been on a national stage on multiple occasions, including the Disney Music Days Parade every other year in [[Orlando, Florida]], as well as the [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] Parade in [[Dallas, Texas]] in [[1988]].

==Curriculum==
Topeka High utilizes the block schedule, which includes eight classes on alternating days plus "Trojan Time", on Thursdays and Fridays, which allows students to sign out to specific locations for further help from teachers or just stay in their current class and study.  Six percent of Topeka High's enrollment come as transfer students. Students outside the attendance zone come to the school for its strong fine arts program - including a music program (orchestra, jazz band, drumline, wind ensembles, and concert choirs), its forensic and debate teams, as well as its foreign language program (offering languages Spanish, German, and French). Also, THS also supports a [[MCJROTC|Marine Corps JROTC]] drill team (1999-present). The school newspaper, ''The World'', is a member of the [[High School National Ad Network]]. The school yearbook is "The Sunflower". Both publications are members of JEA and NSPA.  Topeka High, under the direction of Richard Green, has also built up its broadcast journalism program.  ''The Newsdesk'' a bi-monthly news broadcast showcasing student news and feature packages.  Under the direction of Green, ''The Newsdesk'' has won multiple state-wide broadcasting awards.

==Extracurricular Activities== 
===Athletics===
The extracurricular activities offered at Topeka High School are many and varied due to the school's large size. The Trojans are classified as a 6A school, the largest classification in Kansas according to the [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]]. Throughout its history, Topeka has won 20 state championships in various sports. Many graduates have gone on to participate in [[Division I]], [[Division II]], and [[Division III]] athletics. 

====Mens Basketball====
Topeka High mens basketball has a very storied background a big part of the schools basketball history was the 1949 separation of the basketball teams between black and white players. White basketball players were on the Trojan team, and black athletes were on the Rambler basketball team. There were two different cheerleaders for the basketball teams, blacks didn't have equal representation on the student council, separate school parties were held for black couples and white couples. 
The first black Topeka High team, the Cardinals, started in 1929, and the Ramblers started in 1935. In 2009 the school looked back at the historic separation of the teams. Former UNC coach [[Dean Smith]] came back with a number of others that had to do with the Ramblers to discuss the history of that. There is no separation of the teams now, as it is currently one of the most diverse teams in Topeka.  In the 2009-10 basketball season they have shown to be a lot stronger than past seasons after beating cross-town rival, Highland Park High School, the defending state champions for the past three years. The 2009-10 team is coached by Pat Denney.
