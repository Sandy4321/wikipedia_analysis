==Appearance, size and sexual dimorphism==
[[Image:Pink Convict Cichlid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A young male convict cichlid showing the leucistic colouration]]
The wild-type of the species has 8-9 black vertical bars on a blue-grey body, along with a dark blotch on the [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]].<ref name="fishbase"/> Juvenile convict cichlids are [[sexual dimorphism|monomorphic]] until they reach sexual maturity. Unusually for fish, the female is more highly coloured.<ref name="Wisenden"/> Along with being smaller, female convict cichlids have more intensely coloured black bands across the body and have pink to orange colouration in the ventral region and on the dorsal fin.  The male is usually a tanish-grey.  In contrast, male convict cichlids are larger, have more pointed [[ventral fin|ventral]], [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fins]] which often extend into filaments. In addition, older males frequently develop [[Vestigial structure|vestigial]] fatty lumps on their foreheads.The male color is mostly gray with light black stripe along the body. <ref name="baensch">{{cite book |last=Riehl |first=R<U+00FC>diger.

==Diet==
In natural habitats, the species feeds on [[crustaceans]], small [[fish]], [[insects]], various [[worms]] along with higher [[plant]]s and [[algae]].  Their favorite treat is blood worms.  <ref>Mills D, Vevers G (1989) The Tetra encyclopedia of freshwater tropical aquarium fishes.

==Taxonomy==
The species originally was described in 1867 by [[Albert C. L. G. G<U+00FC>nther|Albert G<U+00FC>nther]] after having been collected in Central America by [[Frederick DuCane Godman]] and [[Osbert Salvin]].<ref>G<U+00FC>nther A (1867) On the fishes of the states of Central America, founded upon specimens collected in fresh and marine waters of various parts of that country by Messrs. Salvin and Godman and Capt. J. M. Dow. '' Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond.'' 600-604.</ref> A number of synonyms exist for this species including: '''''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatus''''', '''''Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus''''' and '''''Heros nigrofasciatus'''''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filaman.uni-kiel.de/Nomenclature/SynonymsList.cfm?ID=3615&GenusName=Archocentrus&SpeciesName=nigrofasciatus|title=''Archocentrus nigrofasciatus'', synonyms|author=Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors.|publisher=FishBase|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref><ref name="crc">{{cite web|url=http://cichlidae.com/gallery/species.php?s=200|title=''Cryptoheros nigrofasciatus'' (G<U+00FC>nther, 1867)|author=Juan Miguel Artigas Azas|publisher=The Cichlid Room Companion|accessdate=2007-03-30}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The common name convict cichlid is, like the species name, derived from the vertical black stripes on the fishes body and their similarity to the striped prison uniforms of [[briton|British]] [[convict]]s. Similarly, the species epithet ''nigrofasciatus'' literally means black-striped.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Convict Noxious Australia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A male convict cichlid caught on a hook and line, in the heated outflow of a [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal powerplant]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].]]
Convict cichlids are endemic to the lakes and streams of Central America. In particular, the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from [[Guatemala]] to [[Costa Rica]], while on the western coast from [[Honduras]] to [[Panama]].<ref name="fishbase"/> Convict cichlids prefer moving water, and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches.<ref>Conkel, D (1993) ''Cichlids of North and Central America'' T.F.H. Publications, Inc., USA.</ref> Convict cichlids are relatively tolerant of cool water, an ability which has allowed the species to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1500 [[metre|m]] (4920 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]]).<ref name="Loiselle">{{cite book |last=Loiselle |first=Paul V. |coauthors= |title=The Cichlid Aquarium |year=1995 |publisher=Tetra Press |location=Germany |isbn=1-56465-146-0}}</ref> At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica the [[pH]] was found to range from 6.6 - 7.8, while [[alkalinity]] ranged from 63 to 77 [[ppm]] [[Calcium carbonate|CaCO<sub>3</sub>]]. The daily water temperature ranged from 26-29 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (79-84 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]).<ref name="Wisenden"/>   

===Feral populations===
The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia, in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria, and also in tropical Queensland.<ref>Koehn JD, MacKenzie RF (2004) Priority management actions for alien freshwater fish species in Australia. ''New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research'' '''38:''' 457<U+2013>472.</ref> In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to R<U+00E9>union<ref name="fishbase"/>, Japan<ref name="fishbase"/>, Mexico<ref name="crc"/>, and the USA.<ref>Yamamoto MN, Tagawa AW (2000) ''Hawai'i's native and exotic freshwater animals.''

Like most cichlids, convicts have prolonged brood care of both eggs and free-swimming fry.<ref name="Keenleyside">Keenleyside MHA (1991) Parental Care. In: ''Cichlid Fishes: behaviour, ecology and evolution'' Chapman and Hall, London. p. 191-208.</ref> The species can reach sexual maturity as young as 16 weeks of age, though sexual maturity is more commonly reached by 6 months.<ref name="Loiselle"/> Sexually mature convicts form [[monogamous]] pairs and spawn in caves or crevices,  like other ''Archocentrus'' species, eggs are laid on the upper surface of the cave and are adhesive. In the wild caves are frequently dug underneath large stones.<ref name="Wisenden">Wisenden BD (1995) Reproductive behaviour of free-ranging convict cichlids, ''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum'' ''Environmental Biology of Fishes'' '''43:''' 121-134.</ref> After fertilisation the eggs take approximately 72 hours to hatch, a further 72 hours is required for the larvae to absorb their yolk sacs and allow fin development prior to the fry becoming free-swimming.<ref name="Noakes">Noakes DLG (1991) Ontogeny of behaviour in cichlids. In: ''Cichlid Fishes: behaviour, ecology and evolution'' Chapman and Hall, London. p. 209-224.</ref> While in this free swimming stage fry feed and forage during daylight in a dense school and return to the cave or crevice during the night.<ref name="Wisenden2">Wisenden BD (1994) Factors affecting male mate desertion in the biparental cichlid fish (''Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum'') in Costa Rica. ''Behavioral Ecology'' '''5:''' 439-447.</ref> Both parents are involved in guarding the fry from brood [[predator]]s and engage in behaviours to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging.<ref name="Wisenden"/> Brood care of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4-6 weeks, <ref name="Wisenden"/> and occurs only once per season for the majority of females.<ref name="Wisenden"/> In contrast, females in aquariums are known to breed many times per year with short intevals of 12-13 days between broods.  They are egg-layers, so give them a large rock to lay eggs on<ref name="Wisenden3">Wisenden DB (1993) Female convict cichlids adjust gonadal investment in current reproduction in response to relative risk of brood predation. ''Canadian Journal of Zoology'' '''71:''' 252-256.</ref> In captivity, breeding pairs of convict cichlids have been demonstrated to adopt similarly aged fry from other parents.<ref>Espmark Y, Knudsen T (2001) Intraspecific brood adoption in the convict cichlid with respect to fry of two colour morphs ''Journal of Fish Biology'' '''59:''' 504<U+2013>514.</ref> In other cichlids it has been suggested this behaviour may reduce predation on the fry belonging to the adoptive parents,<ref>Nelson CTJ, Elwood RW (1997) Parental state and offspring recognition in the biparental cichlid fish ''Pelvicachromis pulcher''. ''Animal Behaviour'' '''54:''' 803-809.</ref> though whether this is the case for ''A. nigrofasciatus'' remains unknown.

==Geographic variants==
[[Image:Claustroheros nigrofasciatus-pareja joven-Bocas del Toro PA.png|thumb|200px|left|a pair of ''A. nigrofasciatus'' collected in [[Bocas del Toro]], [[Panama]]]]
The convict cichlid does display significant variation in colouration across its range in Central America.<ref>Heijns W (2001) [http://www.cichlidae.com/article.php?id=403 A convict from the Volcano] [http://www.cichlidae.com Cichlid Room Companion] Ed. Juan Miguel Artigas Azas.</ref><ref>Azas JMA (2002) [http://www.cichlidae.com/article.php?id=204 ''Cryptoheros'', The Small Central American Cichlids] [http://www.cichlidae.com Cichlid Room Companion] Ed. Juan Miguel Artigas Azas.</ref> Some of these regional variants may be different species, scientific investigations of the taxonomy of these [[Morph (zoology)|morphs]] have yet to be undertaken. In the cichlid keeping hobby, one such fish ''Archocentrus'' aff. ''nigrofasciatus'' "Honduran Red Point" was collected from a stream in [[Honduras]] by Rusty Wessel.<ref>Wessel R (2006) The Honduran Red Point: A beautiful blue convict-type species from Honduras ''Tropical Fish Hobbyist'' '''54:''' 104-106.</ref><ref name="GCCA">Borstein R (2005) [http://www.gcca.net/fom/Archocentrus_sp_Honduran-Red-Point.htm Archocentrus sp. "Honduran Red Point"] Greater Chicago Cichlid Association</ref> Aquarium care of these fish is similar to that of standard aquarium strains of ''A. nigrofasciatus''.<ref name="GCCA"/>

==In the aquarium==
Convict cichlids are easily maintained and bred in aquariums.<ref name="baensch"/><ref name="FKGCC"/> They get along with big fish such as [[Oscar (fish)|oscars]], to which they can be extremely aggresive. The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and should include rocks and artificial caves for breeding.<ref name="baensch"/> The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared [[fish food]]s are readily accepted. The species will also consume aquarium plants.<ref name="baensch"/><ref name="FKGCC"/>  Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone in suitably sized aquariums. It has been suggested that brood care is reduced in aquarium strains.<ref name="baensch"/><ref name="FKGCC"/> Due to the tendency of the species to dig, external [[Filter (aquarium)|filtration]] is recommended over [[Filter (aquarium)#Undergravel filters|undergravel filter]] systems.<ref name="Loiselle"/> The relatively small size, ease of keeping and breeding makes the convict cichlid an ideal cichlid for beginner and advanced aquarists interested in observing brood care in cichlids in the aquarium.<ref name="Loiselle"/>
