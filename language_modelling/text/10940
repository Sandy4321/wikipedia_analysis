==Artwork==
WalkingStick works with oils primarily, but also acrylic, watercolor, mixed media,<ref name=les/> encaustic, copper,<ref name=big>Lesk, 35</ref> charcoal, and gold leaf. She is known in particular for her mixed-media diptychs that juxtapose symbolic, abstract landscapes with representational landscapes.

Two sides singing in concert, each very different from the other yet united as a whole."<ref>Lippard, 185-6</ref>

==Quote==
''I do not see my paintings as landscapes, per se, but rather as paintings that describe two kins of perception of the earth. One view is visual and fleeting and the other is abstract and everlasting. Thse paintings are my attempt to express the mythically inexpressible and to unify the present with eternity.''<ref name=big/>
