'''New York State Route&nbsp;343''' ('''NY&nbsp;343''') is a state highway located entirely within central [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], in the [[Hudson Valley]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]]. It runs east<U+2013>west from the intersection of [[New York State Route 82|NY&nbsp;82]] in the village of [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] to the [[Connecticut]] state line in the town of [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia]], where it continues eastward briefly as '''Connecticut Route&nbsp;343'''. Along the way, it has a 7.3-mile (11.7&nbsp;km) [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] from vicinity of the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]] to the [[Amenia (CDP), New York|hamlet of Amenia]].

The entirety of modern Route&nbsp;343 was originally the Dover branch of the [[Dutchess Turnpike]]. The turnpike, which was in operation from the early to the mid-nineteenth century, was a major transportation route at the time, connecting several local communities to [[Litchfield County, Connecticut]], and the city of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]]. NY&nbsp;343 was designated in 1930, connecting the hamlet of Amenia to the state line, but was relocated a few years later onto the portion of '''New York State Route&nbsp;200''' from South Millbrook to the hamlet of Dover Plains. The NY&nbsp;200 designation was then transferred to NY&nbsp;343's original alignment. NY&nbsp;343 absorbed NY&nbsp;200 in the early 1940s, creating an overlap with NY&nbsp;22 between Dover Plains and Amenia. The Connecticut portion of the highway was originally designated as part of [[Route 4 (New England)|Route&nbsp;4]]; however, it was renumbered to Route&nbsp;343 in 1932.

Several landmarks along the way include the Silo Ridge Country Club in the hamlet of Wassaic, [[Beekman Park]] in the hamlet of Amenia, and the Troutbeck Conference Center in the hamlet of Leedsville.<ref name="amenia quad">{{cite map |url=http://www.nysgis.state.ny.us/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=z50 |title=Amenia Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1989 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=January 20, 2010}}</ref> When NY&nbsp;343 crosses the state line, it becomes Connecticut's Route&nbsp;343 and passes through more rural and residential areas. Route&nbsp;343 stretches for {{convert|1.50|mi|km}} into the town of [[Sharon, Connecticut]], where it terminates at a junction with [[Connecticut Route 4|Route&nbsp;4]] and [[Connecticut Route 41|Route&nbsp;41]].

The road heads eastward into the town of [[Washington, New York|Washington]], intersecting an old alignment of Route&nbsp;82 and passing to the south of Millbrook Golf and Tennis Club. Route&nbsp;343 continues past fields, residential homes, and farms. The highway passes south of the creek, Mill Brook, entering the hamlet of Littlerest, then turns to the southeast at the intersection with County Route&nbsp;99. At the intersection with County Route&nbsp;23, Route&nbsp;343 again changes direction, this time to the northeast, and soon crosses Stone Church Brook in the hamlet of [[Mutton Hollow, New York|Mutton Hollow]]. Route&nbsp;343 then changes directions a third time, traveling to the southeast once again towards the hamlet of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]].<ref name="google"/>

Northwest of Dover Plains, Route&nbsp;343 turns to the northeast and passes into the [[Amenia (town), New York|town of Amenia]]. Just east of the town line, NY&nbsp;343 intersects [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]]. NY&nbsp;343 turns north onto NY&nbsp;22, and the [[concurrency (road)|joined]] routes pass to the west of a series of moderately-sized mountains as they head through regions of rural farms, fields and homes. The roads parallel the Tenmile River and soon intersect with County Route&nbsp;81 (a former routing of NY&nbsp;22) south of the hamlet of [[Wassaic, New York|Wassaic]]. After passing through Wassaic, the roads cross Wassaic Creek and enter a small valley, soon passing the Wassaic Train Station and continuing northward towards the [[Amenia (CDP), New York|hamlet of Amenia]].<ref name="google">{{Google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&rls=IBMA,IBMA:2006-25,IBMA:en&q=from:+US-44+%4041.775920,+-73.701850+to:+RT-343+%4041.762025,+-73.617251+to:RT-22/RT-343+%4041.816908,+-73.563029+to:RT-343+%4041.868133,+-73.501423&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl |title=overview map of NY 343 |accessdate=March 24, 2008}}</ref>

County Route&nbsp;81 merges with NY&nbsp;22 and NY&nbsp;343 as the main roads pass by [[Beekman Park (Amenia, New York)|Beekman Park]] and Silo Ridge Country Club in the hamlet of Amenia. The roads pass a pond and split at the intersection with U.S. Route&nbsp;44. US&nbsp;44 and NY&nbsp;22 continue to the north, and NY&nbsp;343 continues eastward towards the state line. The road passes south of the Amenia Cemetery, changing directions several times. Route&nbsp;343 then intersects with County Route&nbsp;2 and turns to the northeast, passing over the Webatuck Creek. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, NY&nbsp;343 crosses the state line and enters Connecticut.<ref name="google"/>

NY&nbsp;343 is classified as a rural major [[collector road]] between Millbrook and Dover Plains and carries average annual daily traffic ([[AADT]]) of about 3,100 vehicles per day (as of 2006), 5% of which is classified as truck traffic. The portion concurrent with Route&nbsp;22 is a rural principal [[arterial road]] with average traffic of 5,600 per day (with 7% classified as truck traffic). East of Route&nbsp;22, Route&nbsp;343 is a rural minor arterial road carrying about 4,100 vehicles per day (with 6% classified as truck traffic).<ref>{{cite web |title=Traffic Data Viewer |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/tdv}}</ref><ref>{{cite|author=Highway Data Services Bureau|title=Highway Condition Survey of State Touring and Reference Routes (2006)|work=Pavement Management; Highway Data Management Systems|publisher=New York State Department of Transportation|date=August 6, 2008}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Old roads ===
The alignment used by modern Route&nbsp;343 was a major transportation route that passed through the colonial settlements of Wassaic and Amenia. The highway helped General [[George Washington]]'s troops during the [[Revolutionary War]] and was also the main supply route to the hamlets of Payne's Corners (now Amenia), Washiac (now Wassaic) and Dover Plains. Stone statues that marked the way to different places including [[New York City]], [[Fishkill (village), New York|Fishkill]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] were put up along the road during the Revolution, helping suppliers of [[salt]] from Boston.<ref name="history1"/> This highway grew significantly over the years, with settlements growing along the highway during the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dutchess County Tourism Department|url=http://www.dutchesstourism.com/PDF/2005-Brochures/tour4.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dutchess County Tours|publisher=[[Dutchess County, New York]]|accessdate=June 7, 2008}}</ref> There were also a few factories along the route, including a [[Borden Food Corporation]] factory that produced [[condensed milk]] in the 1860s.<ref name="International">{{cite book|title=International Directory of Company Histories|volume=22|year=1998|publisher=St. James Press|isbn=1558623639}}</ref>

Route&nbsp;343 from the NY&nbsp;22&nbsp;/ US&nbsp;44 intersection in Amenia to the [[Connecticut]] state line was part of the main line of the [[Dutchess Turnpike]], which ran from [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] to the state line at Amenia, mostly along modern US&nbsp;44. Prior to the building of the turnpike, the section of modern Route&nbsp;343 east of Amenia to the state line was a swamp and did not connect Amenia to the state line.<ref name="history1">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9QUCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Early+history+of+Amenia&lr=&ei=pYdKSOCGKaPujAGZxdzmDQ#PPA103,M1|title=Early History of Amenia|first=Newton |last=Reed|accessdate=June 7, 2008 | year=1875 | publisher=De Lacey & Wiley, Printers}}</ref> The turnpike corporation was established by law in April 1802 and finished grading the highway in 1805.<ref name="1802 to 1805">{{cite book|author=Dutchess County Unit Federal Writers' Project|title=American Guide Series: Dutchess County|year=1937|publisher=William Penn Association of Philadelphia|accessdate=June 7, 2008|ISBN=0-404-57944-2}}</ref> In May 1803, the continuation of the Dutchess Turnpike into Connecticut, the [[Goshen and Sharon Turnpike]], was also chartered.

=== Designation ===
In 1924, the main line of the Dutchess Turnpike was designated as [[New York State Route 21 (1920s)|NY&nbsp;21]], connecting the city of [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]] to the Connecticut state line as the original turnpike did. The road continued into Connecticut as [[Route 4 (New England)|Route&nbsp;4]], a highway that was part of the [[New England road marking system]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 21, 1924|page=XX9}}</ref> In the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 state highway renumbering]], old NY&nbsp;21 was broken up into several state routes. The portion between [[New York State Route 82A|NY&nbsp;82A]] west of the [[Amenia (CDP), New York|hamlet of Amenia]] and the Connecticut state line in the town of [[Sharon, Connecticut|Sharon]] was renumbered as NY&nbsp;343.<ref name="1930nyt">{{cite news |first=Leon A. |last=Dickinson |title=New Signs for State Highways |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 12, 1930 |page=136}}</ref><ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1930/31 and 1931/32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930/31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the [[1930 renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering]]</ref> In 1932, the continuation of NY&nbsp;343 in Connecticut was renumbered from Route&nbsp;4 to Route&nbsp;343 to match the New York route number.<ref name="1931gb">{{cite book |title=Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book |edition=1931<U+2013>32 |year=1931 |publisher=Scarborough Motor Guide Co |location=Boston |pages=146<U+2013>147}}</ref>

As part of the 1930 renumbering, the Dover branch of the Dutchess Turnpike between modern [[New York State Route 82|NY&nbsp;82]] in the village of [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]] and [[New York State Route 22|NY&nbsp;22]] north of the hamlet of [[Dover Plains, New York|Dover Plains]] was designated as part of NY&nbsp;200, which began in the city of Poughkeepsie and went via Millbrook to the vicinity of Dover Plains.<ref name="1930nyt" /> [[U.S. Route 44 (New York)|U.S. Route&nbsp;44]] was assigned ca. 1935, resulting in the reconfiguration of several state routes in [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]]. Two of the routes affected were NY&nbsp;200 and NY&nbsp;343. The alignments of the two routes were swapped, with the former Route&nbsp;343 between NY&nbsp;22 in the hamlet of Amenia and the Connecticut state line becoming Route&nbsp;200 and the portion of former Route&nbsp;200 between the village of Millbrook and the hamlet of Dover Plains becoming Route&nbsp;343. The remaining portions of both routes' old routings became part of the new US&nbsp;44.<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map of New York |publisher=[[Texas Oil Company]] |year=1934 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide <U+2013> New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref>

The NY&nbsp;200 designation was removed from the Amenia<U+2013>Sharon road in the early 1940s and NY&nbsp;343 was redesignated along that section. The two segments of Route&nbsp;343 were connected via an overlap with NY&nbsp;22, which remains to this day.<ref>{{cite map |title=New York |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1940 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |title=New York with Pictorial Guide |publisher=[[Esso]] |year=1942 |cartography=[[General Drafting]]}}</ref>
