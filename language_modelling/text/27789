The '''Class 450 ''' is a type of [[diesel multiple unit]] (DMU) formerly used by [[Northern Ireland Railways]]. 
==History==
In the mid 1980s, Northern Ireland Railways was in the process of upgrading its rolling stock. Having already purchased three [[CIE 071 Class|new locomotives]], it then proceeded to purchase replacements for its [[UTA Class 70|Class 70]] diesel multiple units. A total of nine three car trains were constructed by [[BREL]] between 1985 and 1987 intended to supplement the existing [[NIR Class 80|Class 80]] DMUs then in service. The trains were constructed using underframes of existing [[British Rail Mark 1|Mark 1]] coaching stock, altered to [[Irish gauge|1600&nbsp;mm gauge]] and new [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] bodyshells. Because of this, they bear a strong resemblance to the [[British Rail Class 150]], [[British Rail Class 210]] (based on), [[British Rail Class 317]], [[British Rail Class 318]] and [[British Rail Class 455]], as they use Mark 3 bodyshells.  These were combined with refurbished power units and traction motors from the withdrawn Class 70 units (there were only eight Class 70 units available to be salvaged, so the equipment for the ninth train came from a withdrawn Class 80 train, powercar 88). 

The power cars of the Class 450 units are named after various Northern Irish castles.<ref>[http://www.irrs.ie/Common%20Files/NIR.htm Irish Railway Record Society - Northern Ireland Railways]</ref>

The Class 450 operate along the same lines as the prototype [[British Rail Class 210|Class 210]] DMUs on the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|British network]], in that they consist of a single power car containing the traction and generating equipment (numbered 45x), an intermediate trailer car (numbered 79x) and a driving trailer (numbered 78x) as permanently formed 3 car sets. An additional "8" has been added to the start of all the cars so that they can be used by [[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink's]] computer system.

In 2005, the entire fleet underwent an extensive refurbishment to bring them up to a similar standard to the newly introduced [[NIR Class 3000 (C3k)|Class 3000]] units, enabling them to remain in service for at least another 5 to 7 years.<ref>[http://www.translink.co.uk/050621NewCentralCorridor.asp Translink - New Central Corridor]</ref> This will take them up to the point where they are expected to become "life-expired."<ref>[http://www.translink.co.uk/resources/pdfs/NorthernIrelandRailwaysStrategicReviewFinalMainReportMay2004.pdf Northern Ireland Railways Strategic Review - Final Report]</ref>

In 2011, the entire Class 450 fleet, together with the remaining [[NIR Class 80|Class 80]] units, was listed by NI Railways for disposal.<ref>[http://www.translink.co.uk/Corporate/Tenders/Rail-Vehicles-for-Disposal/ Rail Vehicles for Disposal] - Translink</ref>

=== Current status ===

The entire Class 450 fleet has now been withdrawn from service, following the arrival of enough [[NIR Class 4000|Class 4000]] units to displace the 450 units serving the [[Belfast-Larne railway line|Larne Line]] and [[Coleraine-Portrush railway line|Portrush branch]]. The status of individual units is in the table below.

==Operations==
As of 30 March 2012, all Class 450 units have been withdrawn from service. Originally they operated on suburban services on the Larne and Bangor Lines, occasionally serving the Newry Line as well, with occasional appearances on the Derry line.

With the arrival of the [[NIR Class 3000|Class 3000]] trains in 2003, the 450s still had to be retained, as the 3000s were only a like-for-like replacement of the old [[NIR Class 80|Class 80]] units. By the year of their withdrawal, the Class 450 units had mostly been relegated to weekday services on the [[Belfast-Larne railway line|Larne Line]] and the [[Coleraine-Portrush railway line|Portrush Line]] shuttle, however at weekends there were enough Class 3000 trains to operate these services.

The gradual entry into service of the [[NIR Class 4000|Class 4000]] trains in 2012 saw the Class 450 units each displaced by a new Class 4000 unit as one became available, until they were all finally withdrawn.

It has been rumoured that one Class 450 unit will be retained as a [[sandite]] train, similar to the way an old Class 80 unit was retained as such until 2012, but this is still uncertain due to the need for a backup unit in such a scenario.
