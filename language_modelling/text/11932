She is the daughter of actor [[Eric Roberts]], and the niece of actress [[Julia Roberts]], and made her acting debut at the age of nine in the film ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]''. She is perhaps best known for her role as the lead character in the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[Unfabulous]]'', and for her role in the film ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]''. 

Roberts is also a [[Pop music|pop]] [[singer]]; her debut album, ''[[Unfabulous and More: Emma Roberts]]'', was released in 2005.

==Biography==
===Family===
Roberts was born in [[Rhinebeck, New York]]<ref>{{cite web | title= Emma Roberts | url=http://radio.disney.go.com/music/incubator/emmaroberts_bio.html | accessdate=February 26| accessyear=2006}}</ref> to actor [[Eric Roberts]] and his then girlfriend Kelly Cunningham. Her parents broke up shortly after her birth amid accusations of [[domestic violence]], which eventually reached court. When Cunningham left the family home in September 1991 along with her daughter, Eric's sister [[Julia Roberts]] bought a house for the pair to live in. She also sided with Cunningham in her successful [[custody]] battle over Emma, resulting in a rift between her and her brother for the years to come.<ref>{{cite web | title= Roberts Rule: With Emma's Star on the Rise, They're a Dynasty | url=http://webcenters.netscape.compuserve.com/celebrity/becksmith.jsp?p=bsf_robertsrule | accessdate=September 24| accessyear=2005}}</ref> Emma saw very little of her father following the custody decision, although her mother and Julia Roberts remained close.

Emma's [[half sister]], Grace Nickels <U+2014> the daughter of her mother and former [[L.A. Guns]] bassist [[Kelly Nickels]] <U+2014> was born in early 2001. In a 2005 interview, Roberts stated that she is "definitely closer to [her] mum and stepdad and [she doesn't] see [her] real father much."<ref name=youmag>{{cite journal | author=Elaine Lipworth | title= "Recognise That Smile?" | journal=You Magazine | year=2005 | issue=[[July 24]] [[2005]] | pages= pp. 28&ndash;31}}</ref>

Following the marriage of Eric Roberts to actress [[Eliza Roberts|Eliza Simons]] (n<U+00E9>e Eliza Garrett) in 1992, Emma also has a stepbrother, Keaton Simons, and a stepsister, Morgan Simons (both children from Eliza Simons' first marriage with James Simons).

===Career===
[[Image:Emma_Roberts_in_Blow.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Roberts, age 9, in her first role, as Kristina Jung in ''Blow'']]<!-- FAIR USE of Emma_Roberts_in_Blow.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Emma_Roberts_in_Blow.jpg for rationale -->
During her childhood, Roberts spent a lot of time on the sets of the films that her aunt was starring in. These experiences sparked a desire in Roberts, from the age of five, to follow her father and aunt into the film industry.<ref name=youmag /> Although her mother initially opposed, wanting her daughter to have a normal childhood, Roberts made her acting debut in [[Ted Demme]]'s 2001 drama ''[[Blow (film)|Blow]]'' &mdash; the first movie she ever auditioned for &mdash; at the age of nine. In the film she portrayed Kristina Jung, the daughter of [[Johnny Depp]]'s character, cocaine smuggler [[George Jung]]. As the film is [[MPAA film rating system|rated R]], her mother reportedly will not allow Roberts to see it before she turns eighteen. However, director Ted Demme produced a tape for her that featured only the scenes she appeared in.<ref>{{cite web | title=Absolutely Fabulous Emma Roberts | work=Discovery Girls | url=http://www.discoverygirls.com/celeb_0809.shtml | accessdate=January 27 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

In 2001, Roberts also had a role in [[Leif Tilden]]'s 10-minute [[short film|short]] ''[[bigLove]]'' (which also starred her future step-father, Kelly Nickels), and was an uncredited [[Extra (drama)|extra]] in one of Julia Roberts' scenes in ''[[America's Sweethearts]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Greasepaint Genes | work=[[Newsweek]] | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9457455/site/newsweek/ | accessdate=September 25 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>
She went on to appear in smaller roles in two [[family film]]s: in 2002's ''[[Grand Champion]]'', as the sister of the main character Buddy ([[Jacob Fisher]]); and in 2003's ''[[Spymate]]'', as the kidnapped daughter of former [[secret agent]] Mike Muggins ([[Chris Potter (actor)|Chris Potter]]), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. ''Grand Champion'' had a brief theatrical release in August 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=grandchampion.htm|title=Grand Champion|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=February 26|accessyear=2006}}</ref> while ''Spymate'' was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Spymate - Opens Fri., Feb. 24 | work=[[ThinkFilm]] | url=http://www.vkpr.ca/~w/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=75 | accessdate=February 26 | accessyear=2006|format=PDF}}</ref> In August 2003, Roberts was scheduled to shoot an [[independent film]] called ''Daisy Winters'', starring as the title character, alongside [[Rachel Weisz]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Young Roberts rooted in 'Daisy' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1947283 | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> However, the film, which would have been Roberts' first leading role, never began shooting due to financial problems.

[[Image:Unfabulous_Emma_Roberts.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Roberts as [[Addie Singer]] in Nickelodeon's ''Unfabulous''.]]<!-- FAIR USE of Unfabulous_Emma_Roberts.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Unfabulous_Emma_Roberts.jpg for rationale -->
Roberts became a [[teen idol]] at the age of thirteen, starring as the lead character [[Addie Singer]] in the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Unfabulous]]'', which debuted in September 2004. While Nickelodeon had wanted to cast her for the role from the beginning, series creator [[Sue Rose]] was not convinced of her acting ability until she saw Roberts auditioning for the role, singing a song and playing along on the guitar.<ref>{{cite web | title=Keen on tweens | work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051001/news_1c01tween.html | accessdate=October 31 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> The teen [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] earned Roberts a [[Teen Choice Award]] nomination and two [[Young Artist Award]] nominations in 2005. The series became one of the network's most-watched programs and was quickly recommissioned for a second season.

As her character on ''Unfabulous'' writes songs and plays guitar, Nickelodeon soon considered a career in music for Roberts as well, following the lead of other actress/[[pop singer]]s such as [[Hilary Duff]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]].<ref>{{cite web | title=She's not just another Roberts | work=[[USA Today]] | url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20050107/wk_emmaroberts07.art.htm | accessdate=September 24 | accessyear=2005}}</ref> 
Roberts first contributed the song "If I Had It My Way" to the [[soundtrack]] of Disney's 2005 film ''[[Ice Princess]]''. This was followed by her [[debut album]], ''[[Unfabulous and More: Emma Roberts]]'', which was released on [[September 27]] [[2005]] and is featured as the soundtrack to ''Unfabulous''. The album was rather unsuccessful: it peaked at #46 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Top Heatseekers]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Emma Roberts: Artist Chart History | work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] | url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=691765&model.vnuAlbumId=729963 | accessdate=October 31 | accessyear=2005}}</ref>, and the two music videos released simultanious to promote the album, "I Wanna Be" and "Dummy", received only little airplay.

In 2006, Roberts returned to the big screen, starring alongside [[Sara Paxton]] and singer [[JoJo]] in ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]''. In the film two teenagers (played by Roberts and JoJo) find a [[mermaid]] (Paxton) in their swimming pool. Roberts also contributed a [[cover version]] of [[Weezer]]'s 2001 single "[[Island in the Sun (song)|Island in the Sun]]" to the film's soundtrack. On [[May 15]], [[2006]] Roberts was featured on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Punk'd]]'' with pop singer [[Teddy Geiger]].

In early 2006 Roberts also shot ''[[Nancy Drew (film)|Nancy Drew]]'', in which she stars in the title role of teen detective [[Nancy Drew]], and which is set to be released [[August 10]], [[2007]]. She also signed on to star in ''[[Camp Couture]]'' (produced by her mother, Kelly Cunningham), ''[[Bras and Broomsticks]]'' (based on the books by [[Sarah Mlynowski]]),<ref>{{cite web | title=Emma Roberts heads to 'Camp Couture' for Paramount | url=http://www.entertainment-news.org/breaking/24777/emma-roberts-heads-to-camp-couture-for-paramount.html | accessdate=September 23 | accessyear=2005 }}</ref> and  ''[[Rodeo Gal]]''.<ref name="VarietyRodeoGal">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117942430?categoryid=1238&cs=1&query=emma+and+roberts&display=emma+roberts|title="WB corrals thesp for 'Rodeo' pic"|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 5|accessyear=2006}}</ref>
