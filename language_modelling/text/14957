==Early life==
Blum was born in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], <!--there are conflicting reports about birthplace: NHL.com says Long Beach, Vancouver Giants and WHL say Rancho Santa Margarita--> to parents John and Dana. An avid [[surfing|surfer]] growing up in [[Rancho Santa Margarita, California|Rancho Santa Margarita]], approximately 40 miles southeast of Long Beach, Blum was initially playing [[roller hockey]] recreationally at four-years-old before discovering [[ice hockey]] a couple of years later.<ref name=gamut>{{citeweb|title=Gamut of emotions|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/sports/columns/article_1700915.php|accessdate=2009-02-08|date=2007-05-20|publisher=''OC Register''}}</ref>  He played [[minor hockey#United States|minor hockey]] with the California Wave, a team led by [[Jeff Turcotte]], younger brother of former [[National Hockey League|NHL]] player [[Alfie Turcotte]].<ref name=early/>  Due to the lack of elite minor hockey competition in California, the team travelled to [[Canada]] and the [[Northeast United States]] to play in top-level tournaments.  Blum and the Wave recorded second place finishes in national Midget AAA and Bantam AAA championships culminating in an international Bantam tournament championship in [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia|B.C.]], in 2004.<ref name=gamut/>  Discovered by scouts at one such tournament, Blum was drafted by the [[Vancouver Giants]] of the [[Western Hockey League|WHL]] in the seventh round of the junior draft.<ref name=early>{{citeweb|title=Blum's hockey dream helps heal past personal wounds|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/draft2007/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=2913922|accessdate=2009-02-08|date=2007-06-23|publisher=ESPN}}</ref>

In the midst of Blum's pending [[junior hockey#Major-junior|major junior]] career, his family was beset with tragedy.  A few months prior to his first training camp in Vancouver and a freshman at [[Trabuco Hills High School]],<ref name=gamut/> his house caught fire from a gas leak on April 2, 2004, killing his twin sister, Ashley.<ref name=early/>  Blum has two remaining half-siblings, an older brother and sister.  The following year, during his rookie season in the WHL, his mother was diagnosed with a form of juvenile cancer.  She underwent [[heart surgery]] and [[chemotherapy]] to overcome the cancer by May 2006.<ref name=early/>
