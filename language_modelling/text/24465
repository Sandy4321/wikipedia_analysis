'''Kim Wilde''' (born '''Kim Smith''', 18 November 1960 in [[Chiswick]], west [[London]]) is an English pop singer, author and [[Presenter#Television presenter|television presenter]]. She burst onto the music scene in 1981 with the [[new wave music|new wave]] classic "[[Kids in America (Kim Wilde song)|Kids in America]]", which hit number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Major U.S. success eluded her until 1987, when she topped the charts with her version of [[The Supremes]]' hit "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]". Since 1998, Wilde had an alternative career as a [[gardener]], whilst still being active in music.

==Early life==
Born in November 1960, Wilde is the eldest child of 1950s [[rock 'n' roll]]er [[Marty Wilde]] (real name Reginald Smith) and Joyce Baker, formerly of the British singing and dancing group [[The Vernons Girls]]. As a child, she attended [[Oakfield School|Oakfield Preparatory School]], [[Dulwich]] in southeast London. She moved with her family to [[Hertfordshire]] at the age of nine, where she was educated at Tewin School and later [[Presdales School]], [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], before completing a foundation course at St Albans College of Art & Design in 1980.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/magazines/intro1/index.html The Official Fan Club for Kim Wilde Introductory Booklet, 1981, page 4]</ref> In 1980, at age twenty, Wilde was signed to [[RAK Records]] by [[Mickie Most]].{{cn|date=February 2011}}

==Music career==
===The RAK years===
[[File:Oakfield-school.jpg|thumb|[[Oakfield School]] in Dulwich]]
Wilde released her debut single "[[Kids in America (Kim Wilde song)|Kids in America]]" in January 1981. An instant success, it reached number two in the UK Singles Chart and scaled the Top 5 in other countries such as Germany, France and Australia.<ref>David Kent (1993) Australian Chart Book 1970 - 1992, Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W.</ref> Although it achieved only moderate success in the U.S., peaking at number 25 when released in 1982, it is often regarded today as Wilde's signature song. Her debut album ''[[Kim Wilde (album)|Kim Wilde]]'' repeated the success of the single, spawning two further hits in "[[Chequered Love]]" (Top 5 in the UK, France, Australia and Germany) and the UK-only single "[[Water on Glass]]".
Her follow-up album was 1982's ''[[Select (album)|Select]]'', led by the hit singles "[[Cambodia (song)|Cambodia]]" and "[[View From a Bridge]]". Both were Number 1 hits in France and reached Top 10 positions in Germany and Australia. At the time, there was some controversy about Wilde's hesitation to do live concerts.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1981/kim-wilde-taking-different-route-to-top-word-of-mouth-personal-promotions-not-live-sho Kim Wilde taking different route to top : Word-of-mouth, Personal Promotions, Not Live Shows build sales] Billboard (USA), 19 September 1981</ref> Her first concerts in September 1982 took place in Denmark,<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1982/1200-wild-wilde-friends 1200 Wild Wilde-friends] Sj<U+00E6>llands Tidende (Denmark), 11 September 1982</ref> before embarking on a UK-wide tour in October.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/articles/1982/finally-kim-on-tour Finally: Kim on tour] Veronica (Netherlands), 2 October 1982</ref> Wilde's third album, ''[[Catch as Catch Can (album)|Catch as Catch Can]]'' (1983) was a relative failure.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The first single from the album, "[[Love Blonde]]", was another success in France and Scandinavia, but failed to have major success in other countries. The failure of the album led her to her leaving RAK and signing with [[MCA Records]] in the summer of 1984.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===The MCA years===
Wilde's first MCA album ''[[Teases & Dares]]'' was again overlooked in her home country,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} but fared better in Germany, France and Scandinavia as well as scoring another German Top 10 single with "[[The Second Time]]" (which was Top 30 in the UK). The video for this song appeared in an episode of the 1980s TV hit ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' in 1985.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/knight-rider Knight rider] Wilde Life - Official Kim Wilde Fansite</ref> The second single, "[[The Touch (Kim Wilde song)|The Touch]]", was not a commercial success, but the third single, the rockabilly "[[Rage to Love]]", made the UK top 20 in 1985. All of Wilde's songs up to this point, including all her major hits, had been written by her father Marty and brother, [[Ricky Wilde|Ricky]]. On "Teases & Dares" she penning two songs. Meanwhile, Wilde had embarked on three European concert tours (1983, 85 and 86).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

On her fifth album, 1986's ''[[Another Step]]'', Wilde wrote or co-wrote most of the songs. The album's lead single "[[Schoolgirl (song)|Schoolgirl]]" flopped in Europe and Australia, but Wilde's fortunes improved in spectacular fashion with the album's second single, a remake of [[The Supremes]] classic "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]". After topping the charts in Australia and Canada and peaking at number two in the UK, it became a U.S. number one single in 1987. With that hit, she became the fifth U.K. female solo artist ever to top the U.S. Hot 100, following [[Petula Clark]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Sheena Easton]], and [[Bonnie Tyler]].<ref name=BBCAmerica>[http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/23/anglophenia.jsp?bc_id=987 Leona Lewis, First UK Woman In 21 Years To Top Billboard Hot 100] BBC America, 27 March 2008</ref> Wilde later admitted to "not knowing the song terribly well" beforehand: "Basically we just went into the studio with a lot of energy and not a lot of reverence. We changed quite a lot of the song and I think that's why it was so successful. It was a very spontaneous idea."<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/you-keep-me-hangin-on kimwilde.com You keep me hangin' on] Wilde Life - Official Kim Wilde Fansite</ref> Her popularity, especially in her native UK, was revitalised and she scored further Top 10 hits in 1987 with "[[Another Step (Closer to You)]]" (recorded with [[Norman Giscombe|Junior]]) and "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]" (a [[Comic Relief]] charity single, recorded with comedian [[Mel Smith]]).

In 1988, Wilde released her biggest selling album to date,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} ''[[Close (album)|Close]]'', which returned her to the UK top 10 and spent almost eight months on the UK album chart. It produced four major European hits: "Hey Mr.Heartache", "[[You Came]]", "[[Never Trust a Stranger]]" and "[[Four Letter Word]]", (the last 3 were Top 10 hits in the UK). The release of the album coincided with a tour of Europe, where she was the opening act for [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Bad World Tour]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Wilde released her next album, ''[[Love Moves]]'', in 1990. The album barely made the UK Top 40, and, although it was a Top 10 success in Scandinavian countries, it failed to sell as well as its predecessor and only spawned two minor hits, "[[It's Here]]" a Top 20 success in Middle and Northern Europe as well as "[[Can't Get Enough (Of Your Love)]]", her last Top 20 hit in France. She toured Europe again, this time opening for fellow Briton [[David Bowie]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

A collaboration with [[Rick Nowels]], who had produced hits for [[Stevie Nicks]] and [[Belinda Carlisle]], resulted in the guitar-driven pop of the single "[[Love Is Holy]]" and the album ''[[Love Is (Kim Wilde album)|Love Is]]'' (1992). The album's success was again limited to a small number of countries, though the single became another Top 20 hit in the UK, and the second single ("Heart Over Mind") also made the top 40.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 1993, she released her first official compilation album ''[[The Singles Collection 1981<U+2013>1993]]'', which was a success throughout Europe and Australia and the dancefloor-influenced single "[[If I Can't Have You]]" (a cover of the [[Yvonne Elliman]] song from the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' that was penned by [[The Bee Gees]]), became her last UK Top 20 Hit as well as a number 3 hit in Australia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Wilde embarked on a huge "Greatest Hits" concert tour through Europe in 1994 and also toured Australia and Japan for the first time in six years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Her next album, ''[[Now & Forever (Kim Wilde album)|Now & Forever]]'' (1995), was a commercial failure worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Her single "Breakin' Away", however, was a minor hit, and the follow up, "This I Swear", was also a minor hit in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} She released a single (previously performed by Evelyn 'Champagne' King) "Shame" in 1996.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} From February 1996 to February 1997, Wilde appeared in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] production of the [[Musical theatre|musical]], ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} After this, Wilde started recording a new album. However, there were problems with her record company (MCA Records had by that time become part of the giant Universal Music corporation), and legal problems concerning the songs. Subsequently, Wilde abandoned the album which remains unreleased.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Return to Pop===
On 13 January 2001, Wilde performed live for the first time in years, as a guest star in a charity show by the [[ABBA]] tribute band, Fabba.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Since November 2001, she has toured the UK three times (and once in Australia during 2003) as part of the [[Here and Now Tour]], an Eighties revival concert series, together with artists such as [[Paul Young]], [[The Human League]], [[Belinda Carlisle]], [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]] and [[Five Star]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} New recordings also followed; in 2001, she recorded a new track, "[[Loved]]", for a [[compilation album]] which became a surprise hit in Belgium.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} She recorded the single "Born to be Wild" in 2002, and in summer of 2003 she had a major hit with "[[Anyplace, Anywhere, Anytime]]", a [[duet (music)|duet]] with German pop star [[Nena]]. The single was a Top 10 hit in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Netherlands and Switzerland.<ref>[http://www.wilde-life.com/encyclopedia/anyplace-anywhere-anytime Anyplace, anywhere, anytime] Wilde Life  - Official Kim Wilde Fansite</ref>

In 2006, Wilde signed a new [[record deal]] with EMI Germany and released the first single from her tenth studio album in many countries across Europe, Scandinavia and Asia. "[[You Came#2006 version|You Came 2006]]" charted Top 20 in most of these countries and became her biggest solo hit in Germany since 1988.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The album ''[[Never Say Never (Kim Wilde album)|Never Say Never]]'' included eight new tracks plus five re-worked previous hits and has charted in Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany. The second single from the album, which was voted for by fans on her official website was "[[Perfect Girl]]", released in November 2006 and spent nine weeks on the German Top 100 singles chart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} A third single, "[[Together We Belong]]", was released in March 2007 and a fourth single, "[[Baby Obey Me]]", was released in Germany as a remix featuring German rapper [[Ill Inspecta]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In 2001, Wilde appeared on the first [[Here and Now Tour]] around the UK and repeated this, as the only artist, four years in a row.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also on different summer festivals and summer Here and Now events, she became a regular guest, including the Australian leg of the Tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Since summer 2003, Wilde has appeared on numerous festival bills and concerts all over Europe with her own show.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In the spring of 2007, she toured (''The Perfect Girl'' tour) around Europe singing new material, and started a second leg of the tour the following autumn.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also in the spring and summer of 2009, she toured around Europe, playing a number of festivals and concerts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} In early September 2009, a brand new single, "Run to You", recorded by Kim and Swedish rock band [[Fibes, Oh Fibes!]], was released in Sweden under the name "Fibes, Oh Fibes! feat. Kim Wilde".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The song reached the Swedish Top 30.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In 2010, Kim signed a new record deal with another label called Starwatch who released her eleventh studio album, "Come Out and Play" on 17 August, with "Lights Down Low" preceding that as lead single.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Impact and recognition==
Kim Wilde holds the record for being the most-charted British solo female act of the 1980s, with seventeen UK Top 40 hit singles throughout the decade (including her duets with Junior Giscombe and Mel Smith).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A number of artists have performed covers of Kim Wilde songs, ranging from pop and rock to dance and death metal versions. In 1991, [[Lawnmower Deth]] released their version of "[[Kids in America (song)|Kids in America]]" as a single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earache.com/catalog/mosh039.html|title=Kids in America|publisher=[[Earache Records]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}</ref> The same year, English [[punk rock]] band [[Toy Dolls]] recorded a parody of "Kids in America" called "The Kids in [[Tyne and Wear]]" on their seventh studio album, ''[[Fat Bob's Feet]]''.
