There was a further closure on 18 October 1976, and it re-opened again on 28 June 1982.

This station was temporarily closed while a major track relaying program was in operation between March and the end of June 2009. It reopened on the 29th June 2009.

==Incidents and accidents==
On 24 March 2000, a woman died after a collision involving a passenger train and her car at a [[level crossing]] at Station Road, Cullybackey. None of the 88 passengers on board the train travelling from [[Belfast]] to [[Derry]] was hurt.<ref>{{cite web | title=Crash victim's name released | date=2000-03-26 | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/689661.stm | accessdate=2007-08-28}}</ref>
The platform at Cullybackey was lengthened to accommodate the longer trains in the evening, coming from Belfast.
