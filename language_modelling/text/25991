The '''Christian Medical Fellowship''' ('''CMF'''), founded in 1949, is an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]], [[interdenominational]] organisation that links together Christian [[Physician|doctors]] and [[medical student]]s in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. There are around 5,000 British doctors in all branches of [[medicine]] who are members of CMF, and also many medical student members.

CMF is linked to similar organisations in many countries through the [[International Christian Medical and Dental Association (ICMDA).]] ICMDA has around 50 national movements linked to it. CMF, in its work with [[Medical student|students]], works closely with the [[Universities and Colleges Christian Fellowship]].  CMF's stated aims are "to unite Christian doctors and medical students in Christ", [[Evangelism]], and the promotion of Christian values. The organisation publishes two journals, ''Triple Helix'' and ''Nucleus'', and organises conferences. 

CMF regularly contributes to debate on issues of [[medical ethics]], for example, making submissions to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[House of Lords]] enquiry into [[physician-assisted suicide]], and generally promotes the [[Pro-Life]] case in ethical debates, such as those around [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]]. More controversially, the CMF journal directed at its Medical Student members contains articles on [http://www.cmf.org.uk/literature/content.asp?context=article&id=619 ''Demon Possession and Mental Illness''] - see Wikipedia [[demonic possession]], which is not a psychiatric or medical diagnosis recognised by either the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)]] nor the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)]].

The position of the Christian Medical Fellowship has in the past been to actively encourage doctors and medical students to use the doctor-patient relationship to [http://www.cmf.org.uk/literature/content.asp?context=article&id=1296 convert patients.] In 2006 and 2007-8 at least two major submissions regarding the Christian Medical Fellowship and its activities encouraging proselytisation of patients were made jointly by a coalition of minority faith communities, interfaith and other organisations to the General Medical Council Standards and Ethics Committee; these submissions directly resulted in the new GMC ethical guidance for doctors [http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/good_medical_practice/relationships_with_patients/maintaining_trust.asp ''Good Medical Practice'' Paragraph 33] and supplementary guidance [http://www.gmc-uk.org/guidance/ethical_guidance/personal_beliefs/personal_beliefs.asp ''Personal Beliefs and Medical Practice'' Paragraph 19] prohibiting such abuses.

The Christian Medical Fellowship has also been the subject of complaint from minority faith communities, including a representation by several Hindu leaders to the [http://www.hvk.org/articles/0703/181.html House of Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences].  The [[Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement]] and the [http://www.gladd.co.uk Gay and Lesbian Doctors and Dentists Association] have also strongly objected to the CMF's position against lesbian, gay and transgendered people, as expressed in a number of articles on the CMF website such as on [http://www.cmf.org.uk/literature/content.asp?context=article&id=348 ''The Health Risks of Gay Sexual Relationships.'']

In October 2007, the Christian Medical Fellowship was accused by ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of attempting to [http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/15/sciencenews.medicineandhealth skew the balance of evidence] presented at the Parliamentary review of the UK's laws on abortion due to a number of its senior members presenting evidence at the Parliamentary Select Committee [http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2007/oct/30/health.homeaffairs without revealing their membership and seniority within the organisation.]
 
The Christian Medical Fellowship is located at 6 [[Marshalsea Road]] in [[Southwark]], south [[London]].
