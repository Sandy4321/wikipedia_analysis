'''Space warfare''' has served as a central theme within the science fiction [[genre]]. Its roots can be traced back to classical times, and to the "future war" novels of the nineteenth century.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Popular And The Canonical: Debating Twentieth-century Literature 1940&ndash;2000|editor=David Johnson|year=2005|publisher=Routledge (UK)|author=Andrew M.

''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?''|isbn=0-415-35169-3|pages=113}}</ref> An interplanetary, or more often an [[interstellar war|interstellar or intergalactic war]] is a staple plot device in [[space opera]]s. [[Space warfare]] has a predominant role in [[science fiction]] writing, but is not believed to be a realistic possibility because of the distances involved and the logistical impracticalities.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer's Guide to Interstellar Travel|author=Eugene F.

== Literature ==
===Lucian===
In his second-century satire ''[[True History]]'', [[Lucian of Samosata]] depicts an imperial war between the king of the Sun and the king of the Moon over the right to colonise the [[Venus|Morning Star]]. It is the earliest known work of fiction to address the concept.<ref name="Swanson, Roy Arthur">Swanson, Roy Arthur: [http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/10/swanson10art.htm <U+201C>The True, the False, and the Truly False: Lucian<U+2019>s Philosophical Science Fiction<U+201D>], ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 3, No. 3 (Nov. 1976), pp. 227<U+2013>239</ref>

=== Future war: the precursor to space warfare ===
The first "future war" story was [[George Tomkyns Chesney|George T. Chesney]]'s "The Battle of Dorking," a story about a British defeat after a German invasion of Britain, published in 1871 in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''. Many such stories were written prior to the outbreak of [[World War I]]. [[George Griffith]]'s ''The Angel of the Revolution'' (1892) featured "terrorists"{{clarify|date=September 2012}} armed with then-nonexistent arms and armour such as airships, submarines, and high explosives. The inclusion of yet-nonexistent technology became a standard part of the genre. Griffith's last "future war" story was ''The Lord of Labour'', written in 1906 and published in 1911, which included such technology as disintegrator rays and missiles.<ref name=Stableford>{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction|editor=Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2003-12-08|isbn=0-521-01657-6|pages=20&ndash;21|author=[[Brian Stableford]]|chapter=Science fiction before the genre}}</ref>

[[H. G. Wells]]' novel ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' inspired many other writers to write stories of [[Alien invasion|alien incursions]] and wars between Earth and other planets, and encouraged writers of "future war" fiction to employ wider settings than had been available for "naturalistic" fiction. Wells' several other "future war" stories included the atomic war novel ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914)<ref name=Stableford /> and "[[The Land Ironclads]]," which featured a prophetic description of the tank, albeit of an unfeasibly large scale.<ref>{{cite web|

=== Space opera ===
The modern form of space warfare in science fiction, in which mobile spaceships battle both planets and one another with destructive superweapons, appeared with the advent of [[space opera]]. Garrett P. Serviss' 1898 newspaper serial "[[Edison's Conquest of Mars]]" was inspired by Wells and intended as a sequel to "Fighters from Mars," an un-authorized and heavily altered [[Edisonade]] version of ''The War of the Worlds''<ref>Edison Conquest of Mars, Introduction Robert Godwin, page 6, Apoge 2005</ref>{{full|date=November 2012}} in which the human race, led by [[Thomas Edison]], pursues the invading Martians back to their home planet. [[David Pringle]] considers Serviss' story to be the very first space opera, although the work most widely regarded as the first space opera is [[E. E. "Doc" Smith]]'s ''[[The Skylark of Space]]''. It and its three successor novels exemplify the present form of space warfare in science fiction, as giant spaceships employ great ray guns that send bolts of energy across space to shatter planets in a war between humans and alien species.<ref name=Pringle>{{cite book|title=Space and Beyond: The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction|editor=Gary Westfahl|publisher=Greenwood Press|date=2000-01-30|isbn=0-313-30846-2|pages=40&ndash;41|author=David Pringle|chapter=What is this thing called space opera?}}</ref><ref name=Clareson>{{cite book|title=Understanding Contemporary American Science Fiction: The Formative Period, (1926-1970)|author=Thomas D.

[[David Weber]]'s ''[[Honorverse]]'' novels present a view of space warfare that simply transplants the naval warfare of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] and [[Horatio Hornblower]] into space. The [[space navy]] battle tactics in the Honorverse are much like those of Nelson, with the simple addition of a third dimension.<ref>{{cite book|title=Voyages and Visions: Towards a Cultural History of Travel|author=[[Jas Elsner]], Joan-Pau Ribi<U+00E9>s|pages=264|year=1999|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-020-6}}</ref>

=== Late 20th century depictions ===
More recent depictions of space warfare departed from the [[jingoism]] of the [[pulp magazine|pulp science fiction]] of the 1930s and 1940s. [[Joe Haldeman]]'s ''[[The Forever War]]'', was partly a response to or a rebuttal of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', wherein space warfare involved the effects of [[time dilation]] and resulted in the alienation of the protagonists from the human civilization on whose behalf they were fighting.<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding contemporary American science fiction: the age of maturity, 1970-2000|author=Darren Harris-Fain|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=1-57003-585-7|pages=55&ndash;57|chapter=After the New Wave, 1970&ndash;1976}}</ref><ref name=Landon>{{cite book|title=Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars|author=Brooks Landon|pages=70|year=2002|publisher=Routledge (UK)|chapter=From the Steam Man to the Stars|isbn=0-415-93888-0}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=No explanation is given as to why Haldeman's novel is supposed to be a reaction or rebuttal to Heinlein's, or why the time dilation effect has anything to do with the main topic|date=September 2012}} Both novels have in the past been required reading at the [[United States Military Academy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Science fiction writers from the end of [[World War II]] onwards have examined the morality and consequences of space warfare. With Heinlein's ''Starship Troopers'' are [[A. E. van Vogt]]'s "War against the Rull" (1959) and [[Fredric Brown]]'s "Arena" (1944). Opposing them are [[Murray Leinster]]'s "First Contact" (1945), [[Barry Longyear]]'s "[[Enemy Mine (novella)|Enemy Mine]]," [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s "The Lucky Strike," [[Connie Willis]]' "Schwarzchild Radius," and [[John Kessel]]'s "Invaders."<ref name=Landon />{{clarify|reason=Two opposing sides are given, but there's no mention of what either side stands for. Also, there are too many examples. Pick a couple from each side, and discuss why they are relevant|date=September 2012}} In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[Ender's Game]]'', the protagonist wages war remotely, with no realization that he is doing so.

Several writers in the 1980s were accused of writing fiction as part of a propaganda campaign in favour of the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. [[Ben Bova]]'s 1985 novel ''Privateers'' has been given as an example.<ref name=Landon /><ref name=Franklin>{{cite book|title=War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination|author=H. Bruce Franklin|pages=200|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-506692-8}}</ref>

==Television and film==
{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2007}}
Early television productions such as ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers]]'' (1949) were severely constrained by the available [[special effect]]s technology, and effect sequences were typically difficult to set up. This, combined with the fact that early shows were often live productions, meant that space action sequences were usually short and simple.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/C/htmlC/captainvideo/captainvideo.htm|title=Captain Video and his Video Rangers|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=2007-02-15}}</ref>

Production techniques improved throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and most programming moved to pre-recorded productions. This allowed more complex effects to be used, and increased the ability of producers to show action sequences such as space warfare. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' is from this period. While the future presented in the original ''Star Trek'' series was not one of open warfare, the machinery of war was ever present, and was used in many episodes. Ships carried missiles armed with [[antimatter]] warheads, known as "[[List of weapons in Star Trek#Photon torpedos|photon torpedo]]s", and [[Force shield|deflector shields]] for defense. Battles were shown on screen, but the expense and difficulty of advanced special effects meant that most battles were short and involved few craft. The costs of special effects dropped dramatically over the years, but remained high enough that larger battles showed relatively few ships firing and/or being hit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1995) used computer graphics developed in part by [[Industrial Light & Magic]], and could show battles between numerous classes of ships using tactics developed by military strategists.

[[George Lucas]]' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' broke new ground in its depiction of space warfare. Advances in technology, combined with the film's comparatively high budget, allowed Lucas to create long, complex space action sequences. The battle sequences were modeled after [[World War II]]-era [[dogfight]]ing from films such as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'', and were a major milestone in fictional space combat. <!-- to do: copy relevant sources from [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]] to here -->

A number of more ambitious films and television series soon followed, including ABC's ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' (1978). ''Battlestar Galactica'' used expensive effects influenced by those of Lucas' film and followed his lead in concentrating on battles between [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]]s. It, and contemporary shows such as ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]]'', set new standards in television space battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/scienceficti/scienceficti.htm|title=Science Fiction Programs|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> The series primarily used laser-type energy weapons in defense and offence on battleships,<ref name="The Living Legend, Part 2">{{cite episode|episodelink=List of Battlestar Galactica (1978, 1980) episodes#Series|The Living Legend, Part 2|title=The Living Legend, Part 2|series=[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica 1978]]}}</ref> although analogues to ballistic weaponry are present in several episodes.<ref name="Experiment in Terra">{{cite episode|episodelink=Experiment in Terra|title=Experiment in Terra|series=[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica 1978]]}}</ref> The 2003 "re-imagining" of ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' uses more conventional weaponry, such as guns and missiles mounted on the primary capital ships and starfighters, and use pure [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] to achieve a more realistic representation of how space warfare would actually appear.<ref name="Miniseries">{{cite episode|episodelink=Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|title=Miniseries|series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|Battlestar Galactica: The miniseries]]}}</ref>
<!-- to do for this section: what happened between 1980 and 2003? -->

[[James Cameron]]'s and [[Gale Anne Hurd]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', the 1986 sequel to the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', used ''Starship Troopers'' as the basis for its futuristic military.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The movie involves a small unit of the United States Colonial Marine Corps who provide emergency response to a planetary colony in 2179. The film showed futuristic twists on many modern types of military vehicle and gear, including a dropship, 10x25mm caseless "Pulse" M41A1 rifles, flamethrowers and machine guns, and realistic body armor and tactical equipment.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The 1993 television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' chronicled a turbulent time in galactic politics, which involved several inter-species wars. Political and humanitarian aspects were explored, such as atrocities against civilian populations, and [[telepathy]] was used as a weapon. The series made an attempt to faithfully depict the physics of combat in a vacuum, instead of using motion modelled on aeroplanes within our atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The 1995 American TV series ''[[Space: Above and Beyond]]'' centered around the "Wildcards", a group of marines in the 2060s who serve as both infantry and fighter pilots. The show attempted to depict technology that was near-future, but based on research. It also explored the alienation of deep space warfare, the horrors of loss and survival on the battefield, the bonds that form in combat, and a fight against an enemy of which they knew little. ''Space: Above and Beyond'' differs from many other military science fiction works in that its soldiers use weapons that fire bullets, and fight in space suits in alien environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The British TV Series [[Doctor Who]], has numerous instances of this. [[Frontier in Space]], set in 2540, mentions a war between Earth and Draconia, fought 20 years earlier. This story involves renegade [[Time Lord]] the Master trying to start another war on behalf of the [[Dalek]]s, who plan to conquer the Galaxy. The [[Time War]] is a major plot point in the revived series, during which the [[Time Lord]]s, the species of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]], fought the [[Dalek]]s. This war seems to have ended with the destruction of the Time Lord planet [[Gallifrey]], which the Doctor did hoping the Daleks would also be destroyed.

===Destruction of planets and stars===
{{Main|Planet killer}}
Destruction of planets and stars has been a frequently used aspect of interstellar warfare since the ''Lensman'' series.<ref>See (e.g.) E. E. "Doc" Smith (1951), ''Grey Lensman'', chapter 23</ref>{{better reference|date=February 2013}} This is not a realistic capability, as it has been calculated that a force on the order of 10<sup>32</sup> [[joule]]s of energy, or roughly the total output of the [[sun]] in a week, would be required to overcome the gravity that  holds together an Earth-sized planet.<ref>[http://www.karlscalculus.org/calc11_1.html#alderaan Uses the Death Star as an exercise in calculus]</ref><ref>[http://qntm.org/destroy A page on "How to Destroy the Earth."]</ref> The destruction of [[Alderaan]]  in ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' is estimated to require 1.0 <U+00D7> 10<sup>38</sup>[[joule]]s of energy, millions of times more than would be necessary to break the planet apart at a slower rate.<ref>[http://www.theforce.net/swtc/ds/ Star Wars Technical Commentaries on the Death Stars]</ref>{{dead link|date=September 2012}}

==Naval influences==
{{primary sources|date=September 2012}}
Fictional space warfare tends to borrow elements from naval warfare. [[David Weber]]'s Honorverse series of novels portrays several "[[space navy|space navies]]" such as the [[Royal Manticoran Navy]], which imitate themes from [[Napoleonic]]-era naval warfare.<ref>''[[On Basilisk Station]]'' (<U+00A9> 1993 [[Mass market paperback]], <U+00A9> 1999 [[Hardcover]])</ref>{{better reference|date=February 2013}} <ref>''[[The Honor of the Queen]]'' (ISBN 0-671-57864-2, Copyright <U+00A9> 1993 by David Weber, First hardcover printing, March <U+00A9>2000)</ref>{{better reference|date=February 2013}} <ref>''[[The Short Victorious War]]'' (1994)</ref>{{better reference|date=February 2013}} The [[Starfleet|Federation Starfleet]] (''Star Trek''), [[Imperial Navy (Star Wars)|Imperial Navy]] (''Star Wars'') and [[Earthforce]] ("Babylon 5") also use a naval-style rank structure and hierarchy. The former is based on the [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Okuda, Michael & Denise (1997). [[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]. [[New York]]: Pocket Books. ISBN 0-671-53607-9. Images accessible at 2265-2370 Ranks. Spike's Star Trek Page Rank Chart.</ref> The [[United Nations Space Command]] in ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' fully retains all ranks of the [[United States armed forces]], even [[U.S. uniformed services pay grades|the pay grade system]]. Naval ship classes such as [[frigate]] or [[destroyer]] are sometimes used as a marker to show how the craft are assembled and their designed purpose.

Some fictional universes have different implementations. The [[Colonial Forces (Battlestar Galactica)|Colonial Fleet]] in ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' uses a mixture of army and navy ranks, and the ''[[Stargate]]'' universe has military spacecraft under the control of modern [[air force]]s, and uses air force ranks. In the ''[[Andromeda (TV series)|Andromeda]]'' universe, officers of Systems Commonwealth ships follow naval ranking, but Lancers, soldiers analogous to Marines, use army ranks.
