'''Mordecai Manuel Noah''' (July 14, 1785, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] <U+2013> May 22, 1851, [[New York]]) was an American [[playwright]], [[diplomat]], [[journalist]], and [[utopia]]n. He was born in a family  of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Sephardic]] ancestry.<ref name=MMNOAH>{{cite web| title = Jewish Virtual Library, Mordecai Manuel Noah| url= http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/MNoah.html|accessdate = 2008-01-10}}</ref> He was the most important Jewish lay leader in New York in the pre-Civil War period,<ref>[http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/research/res_topics_pgc_jewish_essay.shtml New York Jewish History], [[New York State Archives]], Jewish History Resources</ref> and the first [[Jew]] born in the United States to reach national prominence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanjewisharchives.org/|title=Antisemitism, Mordecai Manuel/Cart Catalogue

==Career==
Noah engaged in trade and law, but when removing to [[Charleston, South Carolina]], dedicated himself to politics.

==Diplomat==
In 1811, he was appointed by President [[James Madison]] as [[consul]] at [[Riga]], then part of [[Imperial Russia]], but declined, and, in 1813, was nominated Consul to the Kingdom of [[Tunis]], where he rescued American citizens kept as slaves by Moroccan masters. In 1815, Noah was removed from his position;<ref>Hasia R. Diner, ''The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000'', p.59</ref> in the words of [[US Secretary of State]] [[James Monroe]], his religion was "an obstacle to the exercise of [his] Consular function." The incident caused outrage among Jews and non-Jews alike.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mordecai |last=Noah |authorlink=Mordecai Manuel Noah |year=1819 |title=Travels in England, France, Spain, and the Barbary States, in the Years 1813-14 and 15 |publisher=Kirk and Mercein |pages=376 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8voLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Travels+in+England,+France,+Spain,+and+the+Barbary+States,+in+the+Years+1813-14+and+15&hl=en&ei=N4fgTevcHIbn0QHqzbWwBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=2011-05-28}}</ref>

Noah sent many letters to the White House trying to get an answer as to why they felt his religion should be a justifiable reason for taking the office of consul away.  He had done well as consul and had even been able to accommodate the United States request to secure the release of some hostages being held in Algiers.  Noah never received a legitimate answer as to why they took the office of Consul away from him.  This worried Noah, since he was afraid that this would set a precedent for the United States.  He worried that this would block future Jews from holding publicly elected or officially granted offices within the United States.

Noah protested and gained letters from [[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]] supporting church-state separation and tolerance for Jews.<ref>Richard H. Popkin, "Thomas Jefferson's Letter to Mordecai Noah," ''American Book Collector'' 1987 8(6): 9-11</ref> Prominent [[Reform Judaism]] leader [[Isaac Harby]] was moved to write, in a letter to Monroe, {{quote|[Jews] are by no means to be considered as a [[religious sect]], tolerated by the government. They constitute a portion of the People. They are, in every respect, woven in and compacted with the citizens of the Republic.<ref>"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/01/a-portion-of-the-people.html A "portion of the People"]", Nell Porter Brown, ''[[Harvard Magazine]]'', January<U+2013>February, 2003</ref>}}

==Later career==
Noah moved to New York, where he founded and edited ''The National Advertiser'', ''The [[New York Enquirer]]'' (later merged into the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]''), ''The Evening Star'', and ''The Sunday Times''  newspapers.

In 1819, Noah's most successful play, ''She Would Be a Soldier'', was produced.  That play has since established Noah as America's first important Jewish American writer.  ''She Would Be a Soldier'' is now included in college level anthologies.

In 1825, with virtually no support from anyone-not even his fellow Jews- in a precursor to modern [[Zionism]], he tried to found a Jewish "refuge" at [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]] in the [[Niagara River]], to be called "[[Ararat, City of Refuge|Ararat]]," after [[Mount Ararat]], the Biblical resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].<ref name="guenon">[[Ren<U+00E9> Gu<U+00E9>non]] ''The origins of Mormonism'' in Miscellanea.</ref>  He purchased land on Grand Island for $4.38 per acre to build a refuge for Jews of all nations.<ref>[http://nyheritage.nnyln.net/u?/p15004coll3,0 Image of the City of Ararat (Grand Island, NY)] Image in 1825, a Pivotal Year on the Niagara Frontier on [http://www.nyheritage.org New York Heritage]</ref>  He had brought with him a cornerstone which read "Ararat, a City of Refuge for the Jews, founded by Mordecai M. Noah in the Month of Tishri, 5586 (September, 1825) and in the Fiftieth Year of American Independence."

Noah also shared the belief among various others that some of the Native American Indians were from the Lost Tribes of Israel,<ref name="guenon"/> from which he wrote the ''Discourse on the Evidences of the American Indians being the Descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Mordecai |last=Noah |authorlink=Mordecai Manuel Noah |year=1837 |title=Discourse on the Evidences of the American Indians being the Descendants of the Lost Tribes of Israel |publisher=J.

On September 2, soon after arriving in Buffalo from New York, thousands of Christians and a smattering of Jews assembled for a historic event. Noah led a large procession headed by Masons, a New York militia company, and municipal leaders to St. Paul's Episcopal church.<ref>[http://www.jewishmag.com/142mag/mordecai_manuel_noah/mordecai_manuel_noah.htm Major Noah: an American Patriot, American Zionist -- Mordecai Manuel Noah and the Jewish State of Ararat], Jerry Klinger</ref>   Here, there was a brief ceremony- including a singing of the psalms in Hebrew- the cornerstone was laid on the communion table, and the new proclamation establishing the refuge was read. "Proclamation <U+2013> day ended with music, cannonade and libation. 24 guns, recessional,masons retired to the Eagle Tavern, all with no one ever having set foot on Grand Isle." <ref>Major Noah, American-Jewish Pioneer, by Isaac Goldberg, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1936, pg. 196</ref> This was the beginning and the end of Mordecai Noah's venture:  he lost heart and returned to New York a couple days later without once having set foot on the island. The cornerstone was taken out of the audience chamber of the church and laid against the back of the building.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=pJMDR73E8FwC&printsec=toc&client=firefox-a#PPA315,M1 Publications, Volume 1], Buffalo Historical Society (Buffalo, N.Y.), ed. Bigelow Brothers, 1879</ref>  It is now on permanent display at the Buffalo Historical Society in Buffalo, NY.  However, afterwards and despite the failure of his project, he developed the idea of settling the Jews in [[Palestine]] and, as such, he can be considered a forerunner of modern Zionism.<ref name="guenon" />

From 1827-1828, Noah led [[New York City]]'s [[Tammany Hall]] political machine.

In his writings he alternately abhorred and supported southern slavery.  He worried that emancipation would irreparably divide the country.

MacArthur Award-winning cartoonist [[Ben Katchor]] fictionalized Noah's scheme for [[Grand Island, New York|Grand Island]] in his ''[[The Jew of New York]]''. Noah is also a minor character in [[Gore Vidal]]'s 1973 novel ''[[Burr (novel)|Burr]]''.

The modern edition of Noah's writings is ''The Selected Writings of Mordecai Noah'' edited by Michael Schuldiner and Daniel Kleinfeld, and published by Greenwood Press.
