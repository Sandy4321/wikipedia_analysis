[[Knyaz|Princess]] '''Catherine Alexandrovna Yurievskaya''' (9 September 1878 <U+2013> 22 December 1959) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''<U+0415><U+043A><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430> <U+0410><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430> <U+042E><U+0440><U+044C><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F>'', Ekaterina), was the [[Legitimacy (law)|natural]] daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]] by his mistress, later his wife, [[Catherine Dolgorukov]]. In her own family she was known as '''Katia'''. In 1880, she was legitimated by her parents' marriage.

After her father's [[assassination]] in 1881, her mother brought her up in [[France]], and she was married there in 1901, having two sons, but was widowed in 1910. Her second marriage was during the [[World War I|Great War]], in [[Russia]], and she suffered hardships during the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]]. In the 1920s she became a professional singer. In 1932 she settled in [[England]] on [[Hayling Island]], where she died in 1959.

==Early life==
Catherine was born at [[St Petersburg]], [[Russia]], on 9 September 1878, while her mother was still the [[mistress (lover)|mistress]] of Czar Alexander II. When she was two, her parents' [[morganatic marriage]] on 6 July 1880 brought about her legitimation, so that she gained the title of ''Svetlost'', or [[Serene Highness]].<ref>Catherine Radziwill, ''Behind the veil at the Russian court'' (London and New York: Cassell & Co., 1913), p. 106</ref><ref>Lindsey Hughes, ''The Romanovs: Ruling Russia 1613-1917'' (New York: 2008), p. 185</ref>

Her father was [[Alexander_II_of_Russia#Assassination|assassinated]] in March 1881, when she was three, and she lived thereafter with her mother, brother [[Prince George Alexandrovich Yurievsky|George]], and sister Olga, who settled together in [[France]].<ref name=bergamini>John Bergamini, ''The Tragic Dynasty: A History of the Romanovs'' (1969), pp. 370 & 464</ref>
