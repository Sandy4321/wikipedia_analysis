'''Louis Alexander Slotin''' ({{#dateformat:1 December 1910|mdy}}&nbsp;<U+2013> {{#dateformat:30 May 1946|mdy}}) was a Canadian [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who took part in the [[Manhattan Project]], the secret U.S. program during [[World War II]] that developed the [[atomic bomb]]. As part of the project, Slotin performed experiments with [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] [[pit (nuclear weapon)|cores]] to determine their [[critical mass]] values. During World War II, Slotin continued his research at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]].

On {{#dateformat:21 May 1946|mdy}}, Slotin accidentally began a [[fission reaction]], which released a burst of [[hard radiation]]. He was rushed to a hospital, and died of [[radiation sickness]] nine days later on {{#dateformat:30 May|mdy}}, the second victim of a [[criticality accident]] in history. Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent his accident from killing any colleagues. The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.

== Early life ==

Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking refugees who had fled the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|pogroms of Russia]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].<ref name="zeilig22"/> He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of Eastern European immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at [[St. John's High School (Winnipeg)|St. John's High School]], Slotin was academically exceptional.<ref name="zeilig22"/> His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother "had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours."<ref name="zeilig22">{{cite journal |last=Zeilig |first=Martin |year=1995 |month=August/September |title=Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer' |journal=The Beaver |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=20<U+2013>27 |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |accessdate=28 April 2008}}</ref>

At the age of 16, Slotin entered the [[University of Manitoba]] to pursue a degree in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree in geology from the university in 1932 and a [[Master of Science|M.Sc.]] degree in 1933. With the assistance of one of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at [[King's College London]] under the supervision of [[Arthur John Allmand]],<ref name="zeilig22" /> the chair of the chemistry department, who specialized in the field of applied [[electrochemistry]] and [[photochemistry]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |year=1951 |month= |title=In memoriam: Arthur John Allmand, 1885<U+2013>1951 |journal=[[Faraday Transactions|Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=X001<U+2013>X003 |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=TF951470X001&JournalCode=TF |doi= 10.1039/TF951470X001|accessdate= 19 December 2007}}</ref>

=== King's College ===

While at King's College, Slotin distinguished himself as an [[amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave the impression that he had fought for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] and flown experimental fighter jets with the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name="Obit">{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=H.

Afterwards, he spent six months working as a special investigator for [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin's]] [[Great Southern Railways]], testing the [[nickel-zinc battery|Drumm nickel-zinc rechargeable batteries]] used on the [[Harcourt Street railway line|Dublin-Bray line]].<ref name="zeilig22" />

==Career==
=== University of Chicago ===
In 1937, after he unsuccessfully applied for a job with Canada's [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer'| publisher = The Manhattan Project Heritage Preservation Association, Inc.| author = Martin Zeilig | date = August/September 1995 | url = http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_2.htm }}</ref> the [[University of Chicago]] accepted him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first [[cyclotron]] in the midwestern United States.<ref name="science.ca">{{cite web| title = science.ca Profile: Louis Slotin| publisher = GCS Research Society | author = | date = 2007-11-07 | url = http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=290&pg=0| accessdate = 2007-11-21 }}</ref> The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with [[Earl Evans (scientist)|Earl Evans]], the head of the university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon ([[carbon-14]] and [[carbon-11]]) from the cyclotron.<ref name="zeilig22" /> While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that [[animal cell]]s had the capacity to use [[carbon dioxide]] for [[carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate synthesis]], through [[carbon fixation]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Earl Evans, 1910<U+2013>1999| publisher = [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] | author = | date = 1999-10-05 | url = http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19991005-evansobit.html| accessdate = 2007-12-20 }}</ref>

Slotin may have been present at the start-up of [[Enrico Fermi]]'s "[[Chicago Pile-1]]", the first [[nuclear reactor]], on {{#dateformat:2 December 1942|mdy}}; the accounts of the event do not agree on this point.<ref>A 1962 University of Chicago document says that Slotin "was present on {{#dateformat:2 December 1942|mdy}}, when the group of 'Met Lab' [Metallurgical Laboratory] scientists working under the late Enrico Fermi achieved man's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in a pile of [[graphite]] and uranium under the West Stands of [[Stagg Field]]." Slotin's colleague, Henry W. Newson, recollected that he and Slotin were not present during the scientists' experimentation.</ref> During this time, Slotin also contributed to a number of papers in the field of [[radiobiology]]. His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the [[Manhattan Project]], the United States' effort to develop a nuclear bomb.<ref name="science.ca" /> Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Eugene Wigner]] at the university and later at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], Tennessee. He moved to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of [[Robert Bacher]].<ref name="zeilig22" />

== Los Alamos ==

At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties consisted of dangerous [[Critical mass|criticality]] testing, first with [[uranium]] in [[Otto Robert Frisch|Otto Robert Frisch's]] experiments, and later with [[plutonium]] [[pit (nuclear weapon)|core]]s. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of [[fissile]] materials to near-critical levels to establish their [[critical mass]] values.<ref name="Martin">{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brigitt |year=1999 |month=December |title=The Secret Life of Louis Slotin 1910 <U+2013> 1946 |journal= Alumni Journal of the University of Manitoba |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= | url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |accessdate= 22 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007121854/http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |archivedate = 7 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] as "tickling the dragon's tail," based on a remark by physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who compared the experiments to "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |last= Weber |first= Bruce |title=Theater Review; A Scientist's Tragic Hubris Attains Critical Mass Onstage |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3EF933A25757C0A9679C8B63 |publisher=New York Times |date=10 April 2001 |accessdate=12 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |month=November/December |year=2002 |title=Science as Theater: The Slip of the Screwdriver |journal=[[American Scientist]] |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=550<U+2013>555 |bibcode = 2002AmSci..90..550S |doi = 10.1511/2002.6.550 |last1= Shepherd-Barr |first1= Kirsten |last2= Lustig |first2= Harry }}</ref> On {{#dateformat:16 July 1945|mdy}}, Slotin assembled the core for [[Trinity test|Trinity]], the first detonated atomic device.

On {{#dateformat:21 August 1945|mdy}}, [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.|Harry K. Daghlian]], one of Slotin's close colleagues and a laboratory assistant, was performing a critical mass experiment when he accidentally dropped a heavy [[tungsten carbide]] brick onto a 6.2&nbsp;kg [[plutonium-gallium alloy|delta phase plutonium]] bomb core.<ref>{{cite book | last=Newtan | first=Samuel Upton | title= Nuclear War I and Other Major Nuclear Disasters of the 20th Century | publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] | location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana | year = 2007|isbn=1-4259-8510-6 | page=67 }}</ref> The 24-year old Daghlian was irradiated with a large dose of [[neutron radiation]]. Later estimates would suggest that this dose might not have been fatal on its own, but he then received additional delayed [[gamma radiation]] and [[beta burns]] while disassembling his experiment.<ref name=hoffman /> He died the next month.

After the war, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, "I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to my disgust."<ref name="zeilig22" /> Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, "I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers." He looked forward to resuming his research into [[biophysics]] and radiobiology at the University of Chicago and began training a replacement, [[Alvin C. Graves]], to take over his work once he resumed his peacetime job.<ref name="zeilig22" />

In the 1945-46 winter, Slotin shocked some of his colleagues with a bold action. He repaired an instrument 6 feet under water inside the [[Clinton Pile]] while it was operating, rather than wait an extra day for the reactor to be shut down. He did not wear his dosimetry badge, but his dose was estimated to be at least 100 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]].<ref name="ziegler">{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Karl Ziegler|last2=Peterson|first2=Ken M.|title=The Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the Nuclear Age|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QunaUpeENl4C&pg=PA35|accessdate=30 May 2012|year=1999|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3122-1|pages=34<U+2013>35}}</ref> If this dose is accurate, Slotin must have felt some of the mild symptoms of acute radiation syndrome.

=== Criticality accident ===
[[File:Tickling the Dragons Tail.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A re-creation of the incident. The upper half of the beryllium shell is grasped by a thumbhole. The inner plutonium core (or cavity for it) is not visible.]]

On {{#dateformat:21 May 1946|mdy}}, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a [[Nuclear fission|fission reaction]] by placing two half-spheres of [[beryllium]] (a [[neutron reflector]]) around a plutonium core. The experiment used the same {{convert|6.2|kg|lb|1|sing=on}} plutonium core that had irradiated [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.]], later called the "[[Demon core]]" for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the [[shim (engineering)|shims]] normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.<ref name="zeilig22" />

At 3:20&nbsp;p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a "[[prompt critical]]" reaction and a burst of [[hard radiation]].<ref name="Martin" /> At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of [[Ionized air glow|air ionization]] and felt a heat wave. In addition, Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.<ref name="zeilig22" /> Slotin instinctively jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of [[neutron radiation]].

As soon as Slotin left the building, he [[Vomiting|vomited]], a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense [[ionizing radiation]]. Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but irreversible damage had already been done. His parents were informed of their son's inevitable death. A number of volunteers donated blood for [[blood transfusion|transfusions]], but the efforts proved futile.<ref name="zeilig22" />  Slotin died nine days later on {{#dateformat:30 May|mdy}},<ref>{{cite book | editor= Chris Austill | title=Decision-Making in the Nuclear Age | publisher= Halcyon Press| location=[[Weston, Massachusetts]] | year = 1983 |oclc=9778139 | page= 353}}</ref> in the presence of his parents. He was buried in Winnipeg on {{#dateformat:2 June 1946|mdy}}.<ref name="zeilig22" />

The core involved was subject to a number of experiments shortly after the end of the war and was used in the [[Operation Crossroads#Test Able|Able detonation]], during the [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] series of nuclear weapon testing. Slotin's experiment was said to be the last conducted before the core's detonation and was intended to be the final demonstration of its ability to go critical.<ref name="Millerp69">{{cite book | last=Miller | first=Richard L. | title=Under the Cloud: The Decades of Nuclear Testing | publisher= Two Sixty Press | location=[[The Woodlands, Texas]] | year = 1991 |isbn=0-02-921620-6 |oclc=13333365 | pages=69, 77 }}</ref>

The accident ended all hands-on critical assembly work at Los Alamos. Future criticality testing of fissile cores was done with special remotely controlled machines, such as the "[[Godiva device|Godiva]]" series, with the operator located a safe distance away to prevent harm in case of accidents.<ref>{{cite book | last= Jungk |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Jungk | title=[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]] | publisher= Harcourt Brace |year=1958| location=New York  |isbn=0-15-614150-7  |oclc=181321 | page= 302 }}</ref>

Among the seven observers, two suffered from [[acute radiation syndrome]] but recovered. Years later, four of the observers eventually died of conditions that are known to be enhanced by radiation. Although some of those deaths were probably latent [[stochastic]] (random) effects of the accident, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions from such a small sample set.<ref name=hempelman />

=== Radiation dosage===
[[File:Slotin criticality drawing.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A sketch used by doctors to determine the amount of radiation to which each person in the room had been exposed during the excursion]]
The radiation doses received in these two accidents are not known with any semblance of accuracy. A large part of the dose was due to neutron radiation, which could not be measured by dosimetry equipment of the day. The available equipment, film badges, were not worn by personnel during the accident, and badges that were supposed to be planted under tables in case of disasters like these were not found. Disaster badges hung on the walls did provide some useful data about gamma radiation.<ref name=hoffman>{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Joseph G.|coauthors=et al.|title=Radiation Doses in the Parajito Accident of May 21, 1946|date=1948-5-26|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/pajarito.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2012|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory|id=LA-687}}</ref>

A "tentative" estimate of the doses involved was made in 1948, based on dozens of assumptions, some of which are now known to be grossly incorrect. In the absence of personal dosimetry badges, the authors relied on measurements of [[sodium]] activation in the victim's blood and urine samples as their primary source of data. This activation would have been due to neutron radiation, but all doses were converted to [[equivalent dose]]s of gamma or x-ray radiation. They concluded that Daghlian and Slotin had probably received doses equivalent to 290 and 880 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] (R) [sic] (respectively) of gamma rays. Minimum and maximum estimates were about 50% and 200% of these values. The same document also calculated doses equivalent to a mix of soft 80 keV X-rays and gamma rays, which the authors believed gave a more realistic picture of the exposure than the gamma equivalent. In this model, the equivalent x-ray doses were much higher, but would be concentrated in the tissues facing the source, while the gamma component penetrated the whole body. Slotin's equivalent dose was estimated to be 1930 R of x-ray with 114 R of gamma, while Daghlian's equivalent dose was estimated to be 480 R of x-ray with 110 R of gamma.<ref name=hoffman />

In modern times, dosimetry is done very differently. Equivalent doses would not be reported in roentgen, they would be calculated with different weighting factors, and they are not considered as relevant to acute radiation syndrome as [[absorbed dose]]s. Recent documents have made various interpretations of Slotin's dose, ranging from 287 [[rad (unit)|rad]]<ref name=ziegler /> to 21 [[sievert]].<ref name="la-13638">{{cite web| title = LA-13638 A Review of Criticality Accidents| publisher =Los Alamos National Laboratory | author = | month = May | year = 2000 | url = http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/accidents/la-13638.pdf| pages=74<U+2013>76| accessdate = 2007-12-05 |format=PDF}}</ref> Based on citations and supporting reasoning, the most reliable estimate may be a 1978 Los Alamos memo which suggested 10 [[gray (unit)|Gy]](n) + 1.14 Gy(<U+03B3>) for Slotin and 2 Gy(n) + 1.1 Gy(<U+03B3>) for Daghlian. These doses are consistent with the symptoms they experienced.<ref name=hempelman>{{cite conference|last=Hempelman|first=Louis Henry|coauthors=Lushbaugh, Clarence C. and Voelz, George L.|title=What Has Happened to the Survivors of the Early Los Alamos Nuclear Accidents?|conference=Conference for Radiation Accident Preparedness|date=1979-10-19|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/pdf/accidentsurvivorslanl.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2012|publisher=Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge|id=LA-UR-79-2802}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

On {{#dateformat:14 June 1946|mdy}}, the associate editor of the ''Los Alamos Times'', Thomas P. Ashlock, penned a poem entitled "Slotin <U+2013> A Tribute":

{{quote |
<poem style="font-style: italic;">
May God receive you, great-souled scientist!
While you were with us, even strangers knew
The breadth and lofty stature of your mind
Twas only in the crucible of death
We saw at last your noble heart revealed.<ref name="zeilig22" />
</poem>
}}

The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room: "Dr. Slotin's quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity."<ref name="zeilig22" /> Robert B. Brode, a top physicist who worked on the project, argued on the other hand that the accident was avoidable and that Slotin was not using proper procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself.<ref name="zeilig22" /> 

In 1948, Slotin's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the ''Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund'' for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] and [[Hans Bethe]]. The memorial fund lasted until 1962.<ref name="zeilig22" /> 

In 2002, an [[asteroid]] discovered in 1995 was named [[12423 Slotin]] in his honor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=12423+Slotin |title=12423 Slotin (1995 UQ16) |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |accessdate=8 May 2012 }}</ref>

=== Dollar unit of reactivity ===

According to Weinberg and Wigner,<ref>Alvin M. Weinberg and Eugene P. Wigner. ''The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958. Page 595.</ref> Slotin was the first to propose the name "dollar" for the interval of reactivity between delayed and [[prompt critical]]ity. The hundredth part of a dollar is called a "cent".<ref>Hugh C. Paxton: ''A History of Critical Experiments at Pajarito Site''. Los Alamos Dokument [http://www.atomictraveler.com/LANLPajarito.pdf LA-9685-H], 1983.</ref>

=== Popular culture ===

The accident has been detailed in at least three films, including the 1989 film ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]'', a dramatization of the Manhattan Project starring [[Paul Newman]]. [[John Cusack]] plays a fictional character named Michael Merriman who recreates Slotin's criticality accident at the same time the first atomic bomb is being tested.  Scenes of Merriman dying of radiation sickness are intercut with scenes of the bomb test as a dramatic technique to show the horrible consequences associated with nuclear bombs.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0097336|title=Fat Man and Little Boy}}</ref> Slotin's accidental death was also the subject of a 1999 documentary by [[Canwest Global]] and Great North Productions, ''Tickling the Dragon's Tail: The Mystery of Louis Slotin''. The film won for Best Director at the Alberta Film Awards.<ref>[http://www.telefilm.ca/document/en/01/18/jul1998_sep1998.htm Telefilm Canada Investments], retrieved from TeleFilm.ca website, 30 May 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.filmwest.com/images/dbimages/cats/US/US_Catalog.pdf Tickling the Dragon's Tail: The Story of Louis Slotin], FilmWest Catalog, p.61.</ref>

The event was recounted in [[Dexter Masters]]' 1955 novel ''The Accident'', a fictional account of the last few days of the life of a nuclear scientist suffering from [[radiation poisoning]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Schonberg |first= Harold C |title= Dexter Masters, 80, British Editor; Warned of Perils of Atomic Age |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D91E38F935A35752C0A96F948260 |publisher=New York Times|date=6 January 1989 |accessdate=26 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first= Lawrence |last=Badash |coauthors=Joseph O.

Additionally, the criticality accident inspired the ''Louis Slotin Sonata'', a 2001 off-Broadway play directed by David P. Moore.
