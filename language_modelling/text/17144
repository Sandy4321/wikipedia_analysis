'''''Selling England by the Pound''''' is the fifth studio album from the English [[progressive rock]] band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], released on 12 October 1973 on [[Charisma Records]]. It was recorded in August 1973 following their tour supporting ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972).

Upon its release, ''Selling England by the Pound'' was the band's greatest commercial success. It peaked at number 3 in the UK<ref name="genesis">{{UKChartHits|2465}} Genesis hits</ref> and number 70 in the US.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=search_results&artist=Selling_England_By_The_Pound |title=RIAA <U+2013> Gold & Platinum Searchable Database <U+2013> May 02, 2013 |first= |last= |work=riaa.com  |accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> The album reached [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. It was remastered for CD in 1994 and [[Super Audio CD]] in 2008, the latter release including new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] mixes.

==Background==
By late 1972, Genesis had stabalised around [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], [[Mike Rutherford]], [[Steve Hackett]] and [[Phil Collins]]. The group had been regularly touring, achieved commercial success with their previous album ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'',{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=69}} and were starting to gig in the US, particularly in [[New York City]], where they had a positive response.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=72}} However, the group were still getting a negative critical reception, with journalists comparing them to other [[progressive rock]] bands such as [[ELP]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] and [[Pink Floyd]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=76}} After coming off the road in spring 1973, the group realised they hadn't had any opportunity to write any new material, so they stopped touring and set time to create new songs. The group's record company, [[Charisma Records]] insisted they had three months to come up with a new album, which Rutherford considered "the kiss of death".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=77}} Gabriel later said he wrote all his lyrical contributions to the album in two days.{{sfn|Carruthers|2011|p=95}} Charisma released a live album, ''[[Genesis Live]]'', compiled from concerts taped for the radio, to fill the gap.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=78}} Collins considered leaving the group as it was getting stagnant, forming a pick up band with former [[Yes (band)|Yes]] guitarist [[Peter Banks]] for a few gigs.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=79}}

Gabriel chose the album title, a slogan adopted by the [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]] manifesto, to ensure that the British press would not accuse them of "selling out" to America.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}} Overall, it represented a decay of English [[folk culture]] and an increase in Americanisation.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}}

==Production==

===Recording===
Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered [[Island Studios]] in August 1973. As with ''Foxtrot'', John Burns helped with production.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=79}} Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recording sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}} Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding "it was hard to get things going."{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=44}}

===Songs===

|filename=Genesis - I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe).ogg
|title="I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" (1973)
|description=A sample of "I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" from ''Selling England by the Pound'' (1973), the band's fifth studio album.
|format=[[Ogg]]}}
"Dancing with the Moonlit Knight" evolved from a number of short piano pieces composed by Gabriel, which was combined with some of Hackett's guitar figures to make up the track.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=79}} Gabriel added English-themed lyrics to counter the impression from the music press that Genesis was trying too hard to appeal to the American audience, including references to [[Green Shield Stamps]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}} The track ends with a series of [[12 string guitar]] figures that were originally supposed to segue into "The Cinema Show" to make a piece around 20 minutes in length, but this idea was dropped as the result was too comparable to "[[Supper's Ready]]".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}}

"[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]" came out of a [[jam session]] by the group around one of Hackett's guitar riffs. He had presented the riff to the group previously, but it had been rejected because it sounded too much like [[The Beatles]]. It was released a single from the album, which became the first of the group's to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=79}}

Banks wrote most of "[[Firth of Fifth]]" on his own, and had presented it to the group for ''Foxtrot'', but it was rejected. He reworked some sections of the song for ''Selling England...'', where it drew a more positive reception.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=79}} The track opens with a solo piece for piano, that is repeated by the band later in the track.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=109}} Hackett took one of Banks' piano figures and rearranged it as a guitar solo, which dominates the latter part of the track.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=81}}

"More Fool Me" is the second of two songs (the other being "For Absent Friends" from ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'') to feature Collins on lead vocals prior to becoming the band's lead singer in 1975. Uncharacteristically for the group's output at the time, the song was a tender, romantic ballad. It was quickly written by Collins and Rutherford while sitting on the steps outside the recording studio.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}}

"The Battle of [[Epping Forest]]" was inspired by a news story that Gabriel had read several years previously about the territorial battles by two rival gangs. He placed an advertisement in ''[[The Times]]'' in attempt to find more about the story, but was unable to find any further information, so he created his own fictional characters, including "Liquid Len", "Harold Demure" and "The Bethnal Green Butcher".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}} The lyrics have since been praised for their humour and wit, but they did not gel well with the music, which the band subsequently felt was complicated for the sake of being so.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}}

"After the Ordeal" is an instrumental written by Hackett; the first half is a classical guitar and piano piece with followed by an electric guitar solo. Banks and Gabriel expressed disagreement on the song's inclusion on the album, but Hackett insisted it should be kept.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=81}} It was ultimately left on after Gabriel and Banks argued about the length of "Cinema Show", which meant everything was included as a compromise.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=44}}

[[File:ARP Pro-Soloist.jpg|thumb|right|Banks performs the keyboard solo on "The Cinema Show" on an [[ARP Pro Soloist]].]]
"The Cinema Show" is divided into two sections. The first section is a [[12-string guitar]]-based piece, featuring vocal harmonies between Gabriel and Collins, as well as a short flute/oboe solo. The song concludes with a four-and-a-half-minute keyboard solo on the [[ARP Pro Soloist]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/pm/apr09/articles/regenesiskeys.htm|title=ReGenesis : Early Genesis for the modern keyboardist|author=[[Sound on Sound]]|date=April 2009|accessdate=13 December 2012}}</ref> with Rutherford and Collins playing a rhythm in a 7/8 [[time signature]]. The lyrics, written by Banks and Rutherford, draw much of their inspiration from the [[T. S. Eliot]] poem ''[[The Waste Land]]''.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=84}} They refer to a couple named Romeo and Juliet who are getting themselves ready for a date at a cinema. The chorus makes reference to [[Tiresias]] of [[Greek mythology]].

The album closes with a segue from the end of "The Cinema Show" into "Aisle of Plenty", a reprise of "Dancing with the Moonlit Knight" which gives the album a book-end effect. The track uses word play such as "Easy, love there's the safe way home" and "Thankful for her fine fair discount, Tess co-operates", referring to British [[supermarket]]s.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}} At the time [[Fine Fare]] and [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] were British supermarket chains while [[Tesco]] and the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] still operate today.

===Sleeve design===
The album cover is a painting by Betty Swanwick titled ''The Dream''. The original painting did not feature a [[lawn mower]]; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the song "I Know What I Like" as Swanwick told them that she had not enough time to paint a new picture for their cover.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=81}}

==Release==
''Selling England by the Pound'' was released in the UK on 12 October 1973.

Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s [[Paul Gambaccini]] praised the band for attempting something utterly different amidst "a stagnant pop scene", but criticised the album's lyrics for their bad [[pun]]s, their overuse of specifically British pop culture references, and their sometimes overtly silly rhymes. Despite additional complaints with some musical passages, they offered that the album "merits some recognition".<ref name="Stone rev"/> ''NME''{{'}}s Barbara Charone said the album was "the band's best, most adventurous album to date".{{sfn|Carruthers|2011|p=88}} ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Robin Denselow wrote that "much of the material is indistrinctive and tedious".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}}

Retrospective reviews have been considerably more favourable. [[AllMusic]], [[BBC Online|BBC Music]], and The Daily Vault all commented that the album returned to the whimsical eccentricity of ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' while retaining the hard rock intensity and pessimism of ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'', combining the best of both elements to make Genesis's best album up to that point.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="BBCM"/><ref name="DVault">{{cite web |url=http://dailyvault.com/toc.php5?review=1875 |title=The Daily Vault Music Reviews : Selling England by the Pound |first=Herb |last=Hill |work=dailyvault.com |date=8 April 2002 |accessdate=7 June 2012}}</ref> The album's focus on storytelling was particularly applauded,<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="DVault"/> and while The Daily Vault criticised the track "More Fool Me" as being jarringly out-of-place, they offered special praise for Tony Banks's distinctive keyboard work throughout ''Selling England by the Pound''.<ref name="DVault"/> Even [[Robert Christgau]], who thoroughly panned most of Genesis's albums, admitted that the songs "Firth of Fifth" and "The Battle of Epping Forest" have "a complexity of tone that's pretty rare in any kind of art", though he summarised the rest of the album by saying "it sounds as snooty as usual."<ref name="Christgau"/>

In 2012, the album ranked seventh in Rolling Stone's "Readers' Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-your-favorite-prog-rock-albums-of-all-time-20120725/7-genesis-selling-england-by-the-pound-0033753 | title = Readers' Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time, page 5 of 11 |author=Greene, Andy |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> It was also included in [[IGN]]'s list "10 Classic Prog Rock Albums" in 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://music.ign.com/articles/906/906215p1.html | title = 10 Classic Prog Rock Albums | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Pollard]] of [[Guided by Voices]] considers ''Selling England by the Pound'' one of his ten favourite records of all time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gbv.com/oldgbvsite/onioninterview99.html | title = The Onion Interview with Bob Pollard | year=1999}}</ref> Rock author Edward Macan has mixed feelings towards the album, praising "Firth of Fifth" and "Cinema Show" but questioning some of the other material.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=136}}

Hackett has considered the album to be his favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying there are lot of high points but also some lows.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=80}}

===Tour===
The group went on a sell-out tour of the UK immediately following the album's release,{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=82}} but had to cancel the first date at the Green Playhouse, [[Glasgow]] due to electrical safety issues.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=83}} The group realised they were substantially in debt, and needed better management, so they recruited Tony Smith (no relation to [[Charisma Records]] boss [[Tony Stratton Smith]]) as their new manager.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=83}} The tour was filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but was rejected by the band who felt it was not up to standard.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=84}} The group returned to the US in December 1973, with a three day residency at the Roxy in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=85}}

By this time, Genesis were suffering from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel at the expense of the rest of the band, which was one of the factors that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving the group in 1975.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=84}} They took an extended break in 1974 following the ''Selling England'' tour; Collins formed a side project, [[Brand X (band)|Brand X]] while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=87}}
