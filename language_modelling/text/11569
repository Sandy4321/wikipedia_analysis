==Synopsis==
{{main|List of Smash episodes}}
The show revolves around the creation of a new [[Broadway musical]] based on the life of [[Marilyn Monroe]], which is initially entitled ''Marilyn'' and evolves to become ''Bombshell'' after its first workshop.  As the production takes shape, everyone involved in it must balance his or her often chaotic personal life with the all-consuming demands of a life in the theatre. The series features original music by composers [[Marc Shaiman]] and [[Scott Wittman]].

==Cast and characters==
*[[Debra Messing]] as Julia Houston,<ref name="smashbios"/> a songwriter/lyricist and the musical's co-writer. She is married with a son, but had an affair with Michael Swift, who played Joe DiMaggio in the initial Marilyn workshop.
*[[Jack Davenport]] as Derek Wills,<ref name="smashbios"/> the brilliant (and womanizing) director of the musical, who stops at nothing to make the show a success. He has an on-and-off relationship with Marilyn workshop star Ivy Lynn.
*[[Katharine McPhee]] as Karen Cartwright,<ref name="smashbios"/> an [[Iowa]]n who lands a successful audition and becomes the favorite for the role of Monroe. Somewhat new to show business, her ignorance is generally scorned by her peers, though her talent is rarely called into question.

*[[Megan Hilty]] as Ivy Lynn,<ref name="smashbios"/> a veteran chorus actress who was favored by writer Tom Levitt, an old friend of hers, to land the Monroe lead until Karen came into the picture, and finds herself constantly competing with the newcomer.

However, the critical reception for subsequent episodes was less enthusiastic. Kevin Fallon summed up the response in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', writing that "there's been an almost visceral reaction to how rapidly and sharply the show's quality has dipped, and just how much promise ''Smash'' has thwarted...In other words: It's ''bad.''" Fallon cites other critics in demonstrating the general acceptance of this opinion. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/04/the-tv-musical-is-dead/255643/ |title=The TV Musical is Dead |publisher=theatlantic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-4-10}}</ref>
