'''''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was released on 15 November 2005. The film's score was not composed by [[John Williams]] as were the previous three films, but by [[Patrick Doyle]]. This was done because Williams reported having certain schedule problems, as he scored music for [[2005 in film|2005's]] ''[[Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'', ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]], and [[Steven Spielberg|Steven Spielberg's]] remake of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005)|War of the Worlds]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The music was performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], and included three main new themes: one to represent the Triwizard Tournament, one to represent Voldemort, and one to represent Harry Potter's crush on Cho Chang. It also features an ominous reprisal of the familiar Hedwig's theme. A prominent minor theme is present in "The Death of Cedric".<ref>[http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/goblet_fire.html ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''] soundtrack review at [http://www.filmtracks.com/ Filmtracks.com]</ref> The soundtrack entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at position eighty, and also charted at four on the Top Soundtracks Chart.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://login.vnuemedia.com/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004130545 |last=Trust |first=Gary |date=2010-11-24 |accessdate=2010-11-25 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |title=Weekly Chart Notes: Rihanna, Gwyneth Paltrow, the Beatles}}</ref>
