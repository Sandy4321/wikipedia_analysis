'''''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by the American [[pop punk]] band [[Blink-182]]. Produced by [[Jerry Finn]], the album was released on June 12, 2001, through [[MCA Records]]. The band had spent much of the previous year traveling and supporting the album ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[pun]] on male [[masturbation]] ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: a jacket, a pair of pants and an airplane. Several different editions were released with additional bonus tracks.

The album was primarily recorded over three months at Signature Sound in [[San Diego]]. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band to retain the sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' continues the [[pop punk]] sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as [[Fugazi]] and [[Refused]]. Regarding lyrics, the album has been referred to as a concept album chronicling [[adolescence]], with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.

The album had near-immediate success, becoming the first [[punk rock]]-identified record to debut at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and being certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] within three weeks. The album produced three hit singles <U+2014> "[[The Rock Show]]", "[[First Date (song)|First Date]]" and "[[Stay Together for the Kids]]" <U+2014> that were top ten hits on modern rock charts. Critical impressions of the record were generally positive,  commending the record's expansion on teenage themes; others viewed this as its weakness. To support the record, the band co-headlined the [[Pop Disaster Tour]] with [[Green Day]]. A European tour was canceled in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.<ref name="sdreader"/>

The period following ''Enema of the State'' saw the band experience great transition. "We had gone from playing small clubs and sleeping on peoples' floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," recalled Hoppus in 2013. "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying&nbsp;... it scared the shit out of us."<ref name="linernotes1">{{cite AV media notes | title=Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2013 Vinyl Reissue)| year=2013 | others=[[Blink-182]] | type=liner notes | publisher=Geffen / Universal Music Special Markets | location=[[United States|US]] | id=SRC025/SRC026/SRC027/SRC028|quote=This reference primarily cites the Mark Hoppus foreword.}}</ref><ref name="av13">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/blink182-took-punk-to-no-1-for-the-first-time-with,103878/|title=Blink-182 took punk to No. 1 for the first time with a masturbation pun|author= Kyle Ryan |date= October 8, 2013|publisher=''[[The A.V.

==Recording and production==
The band recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] at DML Studios, a small practice studio in [[Escondido, California]], where the band had written ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'' and ''Enema of the State''.<ref name="linernotes1"/> The group had written a dozen songs after three weeks and invited their manager, Rick DeVoe, to be the first person outside Blink-182 to hear the new material, which the band found "catchy [but with] a definitive edge".<ref name="mtv"/><ref name="linernotes1"/><ref name="Kerrang05"/> DeVoe sat in the control room and quietly listened to the recordings, and pressed the band at the end on why there was no "Blink-182 good-time summer anthem [thing]". DeLonge and Hoppus were furious, remarking, "You want a fucking single? I'll write you the cheesiest, catchiest, throwaway fucking summertime single you've ever heard!"<ref name="linernotes1"/><ref name="av13"/> Hoppus went home and wrote lead single "[[The Rock Show]]" in ten minutes, and DeLonge similarly wrote "[[First Date (song)|First Date]]", which became the most successful singles from the record and future live staples.<ref name=Kerrang05>{{cite journal| author =Nichola Browne | date = November 20, 2005| title = Punk Rock!

The band began proper tracking for drums soon afterwards at Larrabee Studios West and Cello Studios in [[Hollywood]]. The working relationship with [[Jerry Finn]] had been so fruitful that the same team was largely engaged for ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'', with Finn producing and Joe McGrath engineering.<ref name=shooman82>Shooman, 2010. p. 82</ref> Finn and McGrath, meticulous in acquiring the best sound, took two days to experiment with [[Microphone practice|microphone placement]], different [[Gain compression|compressors]], and varying [[Equalization (audio)|EQs]] before committing Barker's drums to tape.<ref name="linernotes1"/> The waiting "drove [him] crazy," and Barker recorded his drum parts in "two or three days" while DeLonge and Hoppus watched television upstairs.<ref name="linernotes1"/> When the drums were finished, the band returned to San Diego to record the bulk of ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' at Signature Sound, where they had also recorded its predecessor. While the band worked with few days off, the sessions also proved to be memorable: "We took long dinner breaks, ate Sombrero burritos, watched ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Mr. Show]]'', and laughed way too hard."<ref name="linernotes1"/> When MCA Records executives eventually traveled to San Diego to hear the highly anticipated follow-up, the trio played a joke by only playing them two joke songs <U+2014> "Fuck a Dog" and "When You Fucked [[Hitler]]" (the subject of which later changed to a grandfather) <U+2014> and the executives "lost it," in DeLonge's words.<ref name="totalguitar"/><ref name="toronto1"/> MCA put pressure on the band to maintain the sound that made ''Enema of the State'' sell millions; as a result, DeLonge believed the album took no "creative leaps [or] bounds."<ref name="totalguitar"/> As such, DeLonge felt creatively stifled and "bummed out" with the label's limitations.<ref name="totalguitar"/><ref name=shooman94>Shooman, 2010. p. 94</ref>

The creative struggle was evident from the outset. Hoppus loved everything regarding ''Enema of the State'' <U+2014> including the [[music video]]s and live show <U+2014> and "wanted to do it again," desiring to create a bigger, better and louder follow-up.<ref name="linernotes1"/> DeLonge, however, was striving for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock, which was inspired by post-hardcore bands [[Fugazi]] and [[Refused]].<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|author=Roger Coletti |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/b/blink01/|title=Blink-182: No Jacket Required|publisher=MTV News|year=2001|accessdate=June 22, 2010|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6GFokYg2a |archivedate=April 30, 2013}}</ref> Barker, "never simply a [[punk rock]] drummer," wanted to challenge himself and was listening to a great deal of [[hip hop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]].<ref name="linernotes1"/><ref name="av13"/> The lyrics often turned darker and more introspective for Hoppus, and "love songs became broken love songs."<ref name="linernotes1"/><ref name="av13"/> DeLonge pushed his guitar style further away from that on ''Enema of the State'': "[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] guitar hooks became frenetic 1/16th note spasms," wrote Hoppus in 2013.<ref name="linernotes1"/> Barker's drum parts were [[Loop (music)|looped]] and filtered, creating different sounds.<ref name="linernotes1"/> For the first time, the trio worked in opposition to one another, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.<ref name="av13"/> Hoppus felt that the sessions created an unspoken competition between him and DeLonge, between who could write the better chorus or most clever lyrics. "Our confidence and insecurity begat some heated differences, sometime to the point where we had to leave rooms and cool down," recalled Hoppus.<ref name="linernotes1"/> Finn would often smooth over differences with a joke, offering a fresh perspective and advice.<ref name="linernotes1"/>

In 2013, Hoppus referred to ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' as the "permanent record of a band in transition&nbsp;... our confused, contentious, brilliant, painful, cathartic leap into the unknown."<ref name="linernotes1"/><ref name="av13"/>

==Packaging==
[[Image:TOYPAJbooklet.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Each icon represents a song title; icon three is a [[condom]], humorously representing the album's third track, "First Date".]]
The title is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] [[pun]] on male [[masturbation]] ("take off your pants and jack it"). Previous titles had included ''If You See Kay'' (a pun on "fuck") and ''Genital Ben'', accompanied by a bear on the cover of the album (a reference to ''[[Gentle Ben]]'').<ref name="mtv"/> Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions.<ref name="mtv"/> The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when a young kid walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he "take off [his] pants and jacket."<ref name="mtv"/> Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would "hook him up".<ref name="sdreader"/> Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. Palm scoffed at the amount, and filed suit in 2003 with the intellectual property attorney Ralph Loeb, alleging breach of contract and fraud against the band.<ref name="sdreader"/> Palm demanded $20,000; the band eventually settled out of court for $10,000.<ref name=sdreader>{{cite journal| author =Ken Leighton| date =September 14, 2011| title =Naming Rights| journal =[[San Diego Reader]]|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2011/sep/14/blurt1/|accessdate=February 14, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ERJBgvgo|archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

The cover has three "[[Zoso]]-like" icons for each band member: a jacket, a pair of pants and an airplane. Barker begged his bandmates not to assign him the airplane symbol, citing his fear of flying, but it became his symbol anyway.<ref name=rssnottiest>{{cite journal|author =Gavin Edwards| date =August 20, 2009| title =survival of the snottiest| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| volume = | issue =1085 | page =| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X}}</ref> Journalist Joe Shooman called the title "a glint of sharp intelligence behind the boys' humour as it draws oblique attention to the fact that, latterly, Blink-182 had often been encouraged to get naked in order to promote themselves. It's a very self-aware album title in that context and a portent, perhaps, of what was to come".<ref name="shooman82"/>

''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' has been called a [[concept album]] chronicling [[adolescence]] and associated feelings.<ref name=newrs>Nathan Brackett. (2004). ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide''. New York: Fireside, 904 pp. First edition, 2004.</ref> The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: "The things that happen to you in [[high school]] are the same things that happen your entire life," said Hoppus. "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty."<ref name="mh18"/><ref name="shooman85"/> The record begins with "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical "party" image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics.<ref name="shooman83"/> Joe Shooman called it a "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them".<ref name=shooman83>Shooman, 2010. p. 83</ref> "Online Songs" was written by Hoppus about "the thoughts that drive you crazy" in the aftermath of a [[breakup]], and is essentially a follow-up to "[[Josie (Everything's Gonna Be Fine)|Josie]]".<ref name="shooman83"/><ref name="tourprogram"/> "[[First Date (song)|First Date]]" was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at [[SeaWorld San Diego|SeaWorld]] in San Diego.<ref name="Kerrang05"/> "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness.<ref name="Kerrang05"/> "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" is a joke track intended to "piss parents off."<ref name="tourprogram"/> The fifth track, "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school [[prom]].<ref name="av13"/><ref name="tourprogram">{{cite book|title=Blink-182: Take Off Your Pants and Jacket Tour 2001 Official Program|chapter= |year=2001 |publisher=MCA Records |location= |isbn= |page =}}</ref> The song is downbeat and meloncholy, filtered through "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of [[The Cure]] and hefty drum patterns".<ref name="shooman83"/>

The following track, "[[The Rock Show]]", is the opposite: an upbeat "effervescent celebration of love, life and music". It was written as a "fast punk-rock love song" in the vein of the [[Ramones]] and [[Screeching Weasel]].<ref name="shooman86"/> The song tells the story of two teenagers meeting a rock concert, and, despite failing grades and disapproving parents, falling and staying in love.<ref name=shooman84>Shooman, 2010. p. 84</ref> It was inspired by the band's early days in [[San Diego]]'s all-ages venue [[Soma San Diego|SOMA]].<ref name="tourprogram"/> "[[Stay Together for the Kids]]" follows and is written about divorce from the point of view of a helpless child.<ref name="APCoverStory"/> Inspired by DeLonge's parents' divorce, it is one of the band's darker songs.<ref name="av13"/><ref name="shooman84"/> "Roller Coaster" was written when Hoppus had a nightmare when he and his wife, Skye, first began dating; the song is about finding something ideal but fearing for its certain departure.<ref name=APCoverStory>{{cite journal| last = Heller| first = Greg| date = June 2001| title = All the Big Things| journal = [[Alternative Press]]| volume = | issue = 155| page = p.56<U+2013>64| publisher = Alternative Magazines Inc.| location = | issn = 1065-1667| url = | accessdate = }}</ref> "Reckless Abandon" was penned by DeLonge as a reflection on summer memories, including parties, skateboarding and trips to the beach.<ref name="tourprogram"/> "Everytime I Look for You" has no specific lyrical basis, according to Hoppus, and "Give Me One Good Reason" was written about [[punk music]] and nonconformity in a high school setting.<ref name="tourprogram"/> "Shut Up", a "broken-family snapshot", revisits the territory of youthful woes, described by Shooman as a "fairly familiar [[Rite of passage|rites-of-passage]] tale" that "adds to general themes of isolation, alienation and moving on to a new place that pervade ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket''".<ref name=shooman85>Shooman, 2010. p. 85</ref><ref name="rs"/> "Please Take Me Home" concludes the standard edition of the album and was written about the consequences of a friendship developing into a relationship.<ref name="av13"/><ref name="tourprogram"/>

Several bonus tracks follow on separate editions; some continue the teenage theme, while others are joke tracks. Barker used [[Afro-Cuban#Music|Afro-Cuban]] influences for his drum track on "Don't Tell Me That It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for "What Went Wrong".<ref name="APCoverStory"/>  While DeLonge felt "staple acoustic songs" were big for groups at the time (such as [[Green Day]]'s "[[Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)|Good Riddance]]"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have "What Went Wrong" in its original form.<ref name="APCoverStory"/> "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" he said. "There are so many great forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it."<ref name="APCoverStory"/>  Finn suggested lyrics for the song after viewing a documentary on [[Tsar Bomba|the first Russian nuclear test]]; in the film, an aged Soviet physicist says of watching the explosion, "There was a loud boom, and then the bomb began fiercely kicking at the world."<ref name="APCoverStory"/>

The record was initially released in three separate configurations: the "red plane", the "yellow pants" and the "green jacket" editions.

Critical reception of ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' in 2001 was largely positive. [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' was generally the most effusive of the positive reviews, praising the unpretentious attitude of the band: "As they plow in their relatively un-self-conscious way through the emotional hurdles of lust, terror, pain and rage, they reveal more about themselves and their audience than they even intend to, turning adolescent malaise into a friendly joke rather than a spiritual crisis."<ref name=rs>{{cite journal|author =[[Rob Sheffield]]| date =June 11, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/take-off-your-pants-and-jacket-20010611 | issue =871 | page =| publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ERNZQKvw |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> Darren Ratner of [[Allmusic]] felt likewise, writing that the record is "one of their finest works to date, with almost every track sporting a commanding articulation and new-school punk sounds. They've definitely put a big-time notch in the win column".<ref name="allmusic"/> ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' commended the "adrenaline-laced sonic gems reveling in blink's patented, potty-mouthed humor, recommended only for adolescents of all ages".<ref name=people>{{cite journal|author=Joanne Kaufman| date =June 18, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[People (magazine)|People]]|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20134675,00.html| volume=55| issue =24 | page =| publisher =[[Time Inc.]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0093-7673|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ERNp8t7a |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> British publication ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' offered the sentiment that "when they stop arsing around for the sake of it, Blink-182 write some very good pop songs".<ref name=q>{{cite journal|date =August 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[Q (magazine)|Q]]| page =124}}</ref> ''[[Kerrang!]]'' gave it a high-profile review, calling the record "eminently hummable dummy-spitting tantrum rock for the [[emo]] generation".<ref name=shooman86>Shooman, 2010. p. 86</ref>

''[[The Village Voice]]'' called the sound "emo-core&nbsp;... intercut with elegiac little pauses that align Blink 182 with a branch of punk rock you could trace back through [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] and ''[[Leave Home|Ramones Leave Home]]'', to the more ethereal of early [[The Who|Who]] songs".<ref name=vv>{{cite journal|author =Phil Dellio| date =July 10, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[The Village Voice]]|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/music/what-s-my-age-again/1/| publisher =[[Voice Media Group]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0042-6180|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6ERO9ZX21 |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> Aaron Scott of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'', however, found the sound to be recycled from the band's previous efforts, writing, "Blink shines when they deviate from their formula, but it is awfully rare&nbsp;... The album seems to be more concerned with maintaining the band's large teenage fanbase than with expanding their overall audience."<ref name=slant>{{cite journal|author=Aaron Scott| date =June 29, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[Slant Magazine]]|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/blink-182-take-off-your-pants-and-jacket/19|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EROKw6gm |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt similarly, with David Browne opining that "the album is angrier and more teeth gnashing than you'd expect. The band work so hard at it, and the music is such processed sounding mainstream rock played fast, that the album becomes a paradox: adolescent energy and rebellion made joyless".<ref name=ew>{{cite journal|author=David Browne| date =June 18, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,130871,00.html| publisher =[[Time Inc.]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =1049-0434|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6ERORMcsv |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> British magazine ''[[New Musical Express]]'', who heavily criticized the band in their previous efforts, felt no more negative this time, calling them "teenage dirtbags" who should "fuck right off". The magazine continued, "It {{em|sounds}} like all that sanitised, castrated, shrink-wrapped 'new wave' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon."<ref name=nme>{{cite journal|author =Steven Wells| date =June 18, 2001| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[New Musical Express]]|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/5230| publisher =[[IPC Media]]| location =[[London]] | issn =1049-0434|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EROZSEMd|archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>

More recent reviews have subsequently been positive. Website [[AbsolutePunk]], in part of their "Retro Reviews" project in 2011, called ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' the band's best effort; reviewer Thomas Nassiff referred to it as "a transitory record for Blink-182, but you can't tell just by listening to it on its own. It's developed and it's full <U+2013> it feels holistically complete, dick jokes and all".<ref name=abpunk>{{cite journal|author=Thomas Nassiff| date =July 26, 2011| title =''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review| journal =[[AbsolutePunk]]|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2373972|accessdate=February 14, 2013 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6EROfu1Kd |archivedate=February 14, 2013}}</ref> In 2005, the album was ranked number 452 in [[Rock Hard (magazine)|''Rock Hard'']] magazine's book of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''.<ref>{{cite book|last=[...]|first=Rock Hard (Hrsg.).

==Touring==
The ''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'' supporting tour began in April 2001 in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="shooman82"/> The band returned to the US to promote their new record on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in June 2001.<ref name="shooman82"/> Afterwards, the band set out on the 2001 [[Honda Civic Tour]], for which the trio designed a [[Honda Civic]] to promote the company.<ref name="honda">{{cite web|author=Corey Moss|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439500/blink-182-kick-off-civic-tour-2001.jhtml|title=Blink-182 To Kick Off Civic Tour 2001|publisher=MTV News|date=February 16, 2001|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> The band again received criticism for "[[selling out]]", but the band argued by way of mitigation that their tickets were consistently offered at lower prices than those of other groups of their stature, and by accepting corporate links they could continue to give fans a good deal.<ref name="shooman87"/> In December 2001, the trio played at a series of radio-sponsored holiday concerts, and also appeared as presenters at the 2001 [[Billboard Music Award]]s in Las Vegas.<ref name="disk">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77364/back-injury-scotches-blink-182-euro-tour|title=Back Injury Scotches Blink-182 Euro Tour|date=December 2001|publisher=''Billboard''|accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>

The band rescheduled European tour dates in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. "After the attacks the world kind of went into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not&nbsp;... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," said Hoppus shortly thereafter.<ref name=shooman89>Shooman, 2010. p. 89</ref> The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a [[Spinal disc herniation|herniated disc]] in his back.<ref name=shooman90>Shooman, 2010. p. 90</ref> With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was",<ref name="totalguitar"/><ref name=shooman92>Shooman, 2010. p. 92</ref> and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into ''[[Box Car Racer (album)|Box Car Racer]]'' (2002), a [[post-hardcore]] disc that further explores his [[Fugazi]] and [[Refused]] inspiration.<ref name="influences">{{cite web|author=Jennifer Vineyard|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452089/20020131/blink_182.jhtml|title=Blink-182's Tom DeLonge salutes his roots on new album |publisher= MTV News|date=January 31, 2002|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name="endofworld">{{cite web|author=Corey Moss|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453328/20020408/box_car_racer.jhtml|title=Box Car Racer about end of the world, not end of Blink-182|publisher= MTV News|date=April 9, 2002|accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed.<ref name=shooman94>Shooman, 2010. p. 94</ref> The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.<ref name="TomQA2005">{{cite web |title=Tom DeLonge: No More Compromises|author=James Montgomery|publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=October 28, 2005|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/blink_182/qa_feature_103105/|accessdate=September 9, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AYN98wGy|archivedate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>

In 2002, the band co-headlined the [[Pop Disaster Tour]] with [[Green Day]]. The tour was conceived by Blink-182 to echo the famous [[Monsters of Rock]] tours; the idea was to have, effectively, a Monsters of Punk tour.<ref name=shooman99>Shooman, 2010. p. 99</ref> The tour, from the band's point of view, had been put together as a show of unity in the face of consistent accusations of rivalry between the two bands, especially in Europe.<ref name=shooman101>Shooman, 2010. p. 101</ref> Instead, Green Day's [[Tr<U+00E9> Cool]] acknowledged in a ''[[Kerrang!]]'' interview that they committed to the tour as an opportunity to regain their reputation as a great live band, as they felt their spotlight had faded over the years.<ref name="shooman101"/> "We set out to reclaim our throne as the most incredible live punk band from you know who," said Cool.<ref name="Kerrang06"/> Cool contended that "we heard they were going to quit the tour because they were getting smoked so badly&nbsp;... We didn't want them to quit the tour. They're good for filling up the seats up front."<ref name=Kerrang06>{{cite journal|author=Ian Winwood| date = February 1, 2006| title = Blink-182 vs. Green Day| journal = [[Kerrang!]]| volume = | issue = 1090| pages =44<U+2013>45 | publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]]| location =[[London]] | issn =0262-6624 | accessdate=April 27, 2013 |url = }}</ref> Several reviewers were unimpressed with Blink-182's headlining set following Green Day. "Sometimes playing last at a rock show is more a curse than a privilege&nbsp;... Pity the headliner, for instance, that gets blown off the stage by the band before it. Blink-182 endured that indignity Saturday at the [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]]," a reporter for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote in 2002.<ref name=shooman100>Shooman, 2010. p. 100</ref>

The band released a second DVD of home videos, live performances and music videos titled ''[[The Urethra Chronicles II: Harder Faster Faster Harder]]'' in 2002.<ref name=shooman97>Shooman, 2010. p. 97</ref> Likewise, the 2003 film ''Riding in Vans with Boys'' follows the Pop Disaster Tour throughout the U.S.<ref name="shooman101"/>
