==History==
===Founding===
In 1917, Providence College was founded as an all-male school through the efforts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence]] and the [[Dominicans in the United States#Eastern Province|Dominican Province of St. Joseph]]. The central figure in the college's incorporation was [[Matthew Harkins]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of Providence, who sought an institution which would establish a center of advanced learning for the Catholic youth of Rhode Island.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/|title=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/|title=Providence College - College History|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

Opening its doors at the corner of Eaton Street and River Avenue in 1919 and with only one building, Harkins Hall,<ref name="History" /> the college under inaugural president Dennis Albert Casey, O.P. (1917<U+2013>1921) began with 71 students and nine Dominican faculty members. Under second president William D. Noon, O.P. (1921<U+2013>1927), the college added its first [[laity|lay]] faculty member and opened its first dormitory, Guzman Hall (now known as [[George M. Bradley House|Martin Hall]]).<ref name="y1917">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1917+to+1935.htm|title=Providence College: 1917-1935|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Under President Lorenzo C. McCarthy, O.P. (1927<U+2013>1936), Providence College athletics soon received their moniker, as the "Friars" in black and white had early success in [[basketball]], [[American football|football]], and [[baseball]]. In 1933, the school received [[regional accreditation]] by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].<ref name="y1917" /> The college conferred its first [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], and [[Master of Science]] degrees by 1935, the year when the school's newspaper (''The Cowl'') was first published.<ref name="y1917" />

By 1939, Aquinas Hall dormitory had been built to accommodate more students enrolling in general studies, but with the impact of [[World War II]] upon enrollment, President John J. Dillon, O.P. (1936<U+2013>1944) instituted a chapter of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] in 1943 to allow the college to continue operation.<ref name="y1936">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1936+to+1946.htm|title=Providence College: 1936-1946|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> A class of approximately 380 soldiers-in-training studied in engineering at Providence for a year before going overseas.<ref name="y1936" />

===Post-World War II expansion===
Robert J. Slavin, O.P. served as president from 1947 to 1961. During his tenure in 1955, Providence acquired the House of Good Shepard property that pushed the original boundaries of campus to Huxley Avenue.<ref name="y1947">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1947+to+1964.htm|title=Providence College: 1947-1964|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Slavin also oversaw the establishment of the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) on campus in 1951,<ref name="y1947" /> and the Liberal Arts Honors Program in 1957.<ref name="y1947" />

The athletics program of the college gained acceptance into the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) in 1948.<ref name="y1947" /> Prior to the opening of Alumni Hall in 1955, the men's basketball team played in local Providence high schools. The college also hired [[Joe Mullaney]] as the men's basketball coach.<ref name="y1947" />

President Vincent C. Dore, O.P. (1961<U+2013>1965) opened the doors of the college's graduate school as well as a new dormitory building, now called Meagher Hall.<ref name="y1947" /> President William P. Haas, O.P. (1965<U+2013>1971) opened Phillips Memorial Library in 1969.<ref name="y1965">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1965+to+1970.htm|title=Providence College: 1965-1970|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Co-educational shift===
In 1967, the college added its first lay faculty members in its Departments of Theology and Philosophy, as well as its first full-time female faculty member.<ref name="y1965" /> Two years later, the student [[dress code]] was abolished.<ref name="y1965" /> In 1970, the college decided to admit women starting with the 1971<U+2013>1972 school year.<ref name="y1965" /> The same year, the first female administrator was hired.<ref name="y1965" />

Subsequent president Thomas R. Peterson, O.P. (1971<U+2013>1985) instituted the Development of Western Civilization program, while in 1974, the college acquired the property of the former Charles V. Chapin Hospital on the other side of Huxley Avenue.<ref name="y1971">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1971+to+1984.htm|title=Providence College: 1971-1984|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> The campus was then split in half by Huxley Avenue, providing an "Upper" campus (due to the uphill nature of the landscape on Smith Hill) and "Lower" campus (the new, flatter area of the College). In 1974, the School of Continuing Education awarded the college's first [[Associate's degree]].<ref name="y1971" />

With men's basketball tickets becoming a hot commodity at the 2,600-seat [[Alumni Hall (Providence)|Alumni Hall]] gymnasium, and with the opening of the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center|Providence Civic Center]] in 1972, the Friars moved downtown in time for their [[1973 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Final Four]] appearance behind Providence natives [[Ernie DiGregorio]] and [[Marvin Barnes]].<ref name="y1971" /> The same year, the men's hockey team played their first season in their new home on campus, [[Schneider Arena]].<ref name="y1971" />

In the early morning hours of December 13, 1977, a dormitory fire killed ten female residents of Aquinas Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50714FB3F5E167493C6A81789D95F438785F9&scp=1&sq=%22providence+college%22&st=p|title=7 Are Killed Dormitory Fire at Providence College|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Michael|last=Knight|date=December 14, 1977|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the demographics of the student body continued to change, as women outnumbered men in incoming classes and non-Rhode Island students soon outnumbered in-state students.<ref name="y1971" /> In 1984, Peterson also opened St. Thomas Aquinas Priory at the entrance of campus to accommodate the growing number of Dominican brethren living on campus.<ref name="y1971" />

===Recent expansion===
John F. Cunningham, O.P. (1985<U+2013>1994) succeeded Peterson as president in 1985 and saw the Friars [[Providence Friars men's ice hockey|men's hockey]] team win the inaugural [[Hockey East]] Championship the same year over rival [[Boston College]] and reach the championship game of the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA Tournament]] to lose 2<U+2013>1 to [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]].<ref name="y1985">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1985+to+1993.htm|title=Providence College: 1985-1993|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> Men's basketball again took center stage on the Providence campus, as coach [[Rick Pitino]] and senior [[Billy Donovan]] took the Friars to their second Final Four appearance in the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. Cunningham used the exposure and fundraising opportunities to build two apartment-style residence halls on campus, Davis and Bedford Halls, providing an alternative to dormitory and off-campus housing for upperclassmen.<ref name="y1985" />

Philip A. Smith, O.P. (1994<U+2013>2005) succeeded Cunningham in 1994<ref name="y1994">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/1994+to+2004.htm|title=Providence College: 1994-2004|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref> and oversaw the new influence of women's athletics at Providence, as several alumni and then-current students won the gold medal for [[Providence Friars women's ice hockey|women's ice hockey]] as part of the [[United States women's national ice hockey team|U.S. national team]] in the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in [[Nagano, Japan]].

By 2001, a new on-campus chapel was built, St. Dominic Chapel, followed three years later by the construction of two other major buildings on "Lower" campus: Suites Hall, a suite-style residence hall to provide added upperclassmen housing, and the Smith Center for the Arts.<ref name="y1994" /> Elected in 2005, President [[Brian Shanley|Brian J. Shanley]], O.P. (2005<U+2013>present) has overseen the construction of the Concannon Fitness Center in 2007 as part of an overall renovation to Alumni Hall, as well as renovation and expansion of the Slavin Center in 2009.<ref name="y2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/About+PC/College+History/2005+to+Present.htm|title=Providence College: 2005-Present|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref>

Shanley also removed the college's [[SAT]] requirement for admissions in addition to transferring a significant portion of the school's scholarship funds to need-based aid,<ref name="y2005" /> in order to give more diverse students the opportunity to afford the college. In 2008, Shanley oversaw the founding of the Providence College School of Business (PCSB), creating separate Schools of Arts and Sciences and Professional Studies.<ref name="PCSB">{{cite web|url=http://www.providence.edu/academics/school+of+business/|title=School of Business|title=Providence College - School of Business|work=Providence College|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}</ref>
