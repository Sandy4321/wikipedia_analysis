''Music of the Sun'' was musically inspired by the variety of [[caribbean music]] genres, which includes [[Soca music|soca]], [[dancehall]], and [[reggae]], although the album incorporates some American genres, using a mixture of [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B]].<ref name="Birchmeier"/> The music on the album showcases her musical roots and also reflects on the album's title.<ref name=kidzworld/> Rihanna explained that the word "sun" represents her culture where she's from, the Caribbean.<ref name=kidzworld/> "It represents me.

"Pon de Replay", which features production from Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, is the [[opening track]] of ''Music of the Sun''. Set as the album's [[lead single]], the song helped introduced the tradition of mixing reggae and dance-pop.

''Music of the Sun'' ends with the slow and moody songs, "There's a Thug In My Life" and the [[ballad (music)|ballad]]-oriented "Now I Know."

Upon its release, ''Music of the Sun'' received mixed reviews from most music critics. Some critics, who enjoyed the summer catchy hit single "[[Pon de Replay]]", gave the album a positive review, while others described Rihanna as yet another [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]]-[[Ciara]]-[[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti]] cash-in. Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] commented on the album's lead single calling it a "booming dancehall-lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence [...] it's a simple dance-pop song at its core, with standard English-language singing as well as a can't-miss singalong hook."<ref name="allmusic"/> Birchmeier described most of the album by saying; "''Music of the Sun'' descends into faceless slow jams after a while, overall consistency not being among its attributes, but thankfully it picks up the pace toward the end [...] The result is one of the more engaging urban dance-pop albums of the year."<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r783863|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Music of the Sun Overview )))|accessdate=2009-02-19 |work=[[Allmusic]]|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=[[Macrovision Corporation]]}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars and described as lacking the replay value, ingenuity and rhythm of the single with "generic [[vocal hiccups]] and frills" of US R&B inflecting upon her "Caribbean charm". Walters found "Pon de Replay" to be "a poppy piece of dancehall reggae with slapping, syncopated beats recalling big-band jazz."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/music-of-the-sun-20050908|title=Rihanna: Music of the Sun|last=Barry|first=Walters|date=2005-09-08|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' described the album as a "glut of teen R&B chanteuses " and described her lead single "Pon de Replay" as "a dancehall-pop mixture that owes plenty of its sweat and shimmy to [[Beyonc<U+00E9>]]'s "[[Baby Boy (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]"."<ref name="SlantMag1">{{cite news|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=630 |title=Rihanna: Music Of The Sun |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |date=August 31, 2005 |work=[[Slant Magazine]] |accessdate=2009-05-29}}</ref> Cinquemani also commented that while most of the album coasts atop its lite Caribbean influence, the middle stretch of the record sinks like a [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] album and compared the track "Willing To Wait" to Jackson's "[[Let's Wait Awhile]]".<ref name="SlantMag1"/>
