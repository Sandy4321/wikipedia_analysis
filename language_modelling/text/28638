''Eru'' has numerous common names and is grown in various countries across Africa, including: [[Cameroon]] (''Eru'', ''okok'', ''m<U+2019>fumbua'', or ''fumbua''), [[Angola]] (''KoKo''), [[Nigeria]] (''ukase'' or ''afang''), [[Gabon]] (''KoKo''), [[Central African Republic]] (''KoKo''), Congo (''KoKo''), and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (''m<U+2019>fumbua'' or ''fumbua''). ''Eru'' has also been referred to as a form of <U+2018>wild spinach<U+2019> in English.<ref name="ali">[Ali, F., Assanta, M.A., and Robert, C. ''Gnetum Africanum: A Wild Food Plant from the African Forest with Many Nutritional and Medicinal Purposes,'' Journal of Medicinal Food 14, no.11 (2011): 1289-1297. [DOI: 10.1089/jmf.2010.0327]</ref>

==Description==
''Gnetum africanum'' is traditionally a wild vine and is considered to be a wild vegetable.<ref name="Chindong">[http://www.agfax.net/radio/detail.php?i=473&s=t Chindong, Martha. ''Reporting Science in Africa.'' Agfax.  2011.]</ref> It is a perennial that grows approximately 10 metres long, with thick papery-like leaves growing in groups of three. The leaves may grow approximately 8 cm long, and at maturity the vine will produce small flowers. The seeds of the vine resemble a fleshy fruit ([[drupe]]), sized 10<U+2013>15 mm <U+00D7> 4<U+2013>8 mm, and are red-orange in colour when fully ripe.<ref name="AgroDb">[http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb2/AFTPDFS/Gnetum_africanum.pdf ''Gnetum Africanum: Welw. Gnetaceae.'' World Agroforestry Database. 2009.]</ref>

==Taxonomy==
''Eru'' may also be known as ''G. africanum'' or ''G. buchholzianum'', and are the only two vine species from the gnetum family.<ref name="tekwe">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0671-B5.HTM] Tekwe, C., Ndam, N., and Nkefor, J.P. ''Gnetum Domestication for Livelihood Improvement and Conservation.'' World Agroforestry Congress. 2003.]</ref> There are currently no gene banks for ''Eru'', but approximately 19 varieties of the species have been planted in Cameroon<U+2019>s Limbe Botanic Garden to begin a gene bank.<ref name="tekwe" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''Gnetum africanum'' is found mainly in the humid tropical forest regions of [[Central African Republic]], [[Cameroon]], [[Gabon]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Angola]]. It has been found in primary and secondary semi-deciduous humid forests, both in dense and sunny transitional savannah locations, ranging from sea-level to 1200 meter altitude. The shade tolerant vine does not grow well in direct sunlight and can be found climbing on middle and under-story trees.<ref name="Protobase">{{cite web | url=http://database.prota.org/PROTAhtml/Gnetum%20africanum_En.htm | title=Gnetum africanum Welw. | accessdate=11 January 2014}}</ref><ref name="redlist" />

This vine will grow in all seasons and typically spreads along forest floors. The vine grows in two ways: through rhizomes, or through new shoots that grow where the stem has been cut.<ref name="AgroDb" /> As ''Eru'' is a wild forest vine, it tends to grow best in shaded areas.<ref name="ali" /> Input requirements for ''Eru'' have not yet been established, and nutrient requirements are currently unknown as well.<ref name="Chindong" /> This is likely due to the fact that the vine is traditionally a wild vegetable opposed to a cultivated crop, and so its domestication potential has remained unrealized. However, it has been noted that the vine grows best in well-shaded areas similar to that of a forest, as too much sunlight can burn the vine and produce substandard leaves for selling purposes. It has also been noted that the vine does not grow particularly well in very moist conditions such as marshes and swamps.<ref name="Chindong" />

==Ecology==
''Eru'' has been found to be negatively impacted if grown on or next to termite infected wood or trees.<ref name="Chindong" /> However, the productivity of the vine appears to be resistant to a significant proportion of diseases.<ref name="AgroDb" /> The vine is largely understudied and more research is needed to verify plant susceptibility and resilience to viruses, diseases, and fungi. ''Eru'' depletion is largely associated with tree felling and over exploitative forestry practices. Over exploitation is partly caused by unsustainable forest clearing practices throughout regions in Africa.<ref name="cendep-domestication">{{cite web | url=http://www.cendep.org/domestication.htm | title=Domestication of Non Timber Forest Products | accessdate=26 January 2014}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
Since ''Eru'' grows best in shaded areas it could be used as a complimentary crop on tree farms. Specifically, it has been suggested that the vine could be used as a complimentary crop for rubber and oil trees.<ref name="AgroDb" /> However, the necessity for shaded, but not excessively moist, conditions may make it difficult for poor farmers to grow ''Eru'' if they lack access to suitable lands. However, since ''Eru'' grows via rhizomes it is not labour intensive, therefore allowing farmers to focus physical capital elsewhere.

Sustainable cultivation practices, such as harvesting the leaves regularly rather than uprooting the whole vine, allows for a more viable supplementary income throughout the year. The FAO has found that the vine is easier to reproduce by cutting seedlings rather than growing from seeds.<ref name="tekwe" /> Cutting seedlings is one practical alternative in harvesting the vine as opposed to destroying the entire crop by uprooting it.

The Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) has been working with women to create sustainable cultivation practices of ''Eru'', as well as forest restoration techniques.<ref name="styslinger" /> Specifically, near Lekie, Cameroon, CIFOR has been helping the women remove an invasive plant species (kodengui), and replacing it with ''Eru'', in order to discourage regrowth of the invasive species and utilize the area for a more sustainable resource.

==Uses==
Subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon may be able to improve their nutritional, environmental, social, and economic situations by growing this vine. Nutrition can be improved by using the plant for medicinal purposes as well as through edible consumption.<ref name="styslinger" />

Primarily, ''Eru'' leaves are used as a vegetable for soups and stews, commonly called ''Eru soup'' or ''afang soup''.<ref name="tekwe" /> The leaves of the vine are sold in markets through out the year and may be used in soups and stews or eaten raw. The leaves may further be used as a remedy for nausea, sore throats, or as a dressing for warts. The stem of the plant may also be eaten for medicinal purposes, including the reduction of pain during childbirth.<ref name="styslinger" /> Furthermore, ''Eru'' produces a root tuber that may be used as a source of <U+2018><U+2018>famine food,<U+2019><U+2018> and is similar to that of a yam.<ref name="AgroDb" /> Finally, the seeds of the vine may also be eaten cooked.<ref name="ali" />

''Eru'' is a good source of protein and is strong in essential and non-essential amino acids. It is high in glutamic acid, leucine, and aspartic acid, with low levels of histidine, and cysleine, while there appears to be trace amounts of tryptophan in the plant. The content of amino acids found in ''Eru'' is similar to recommended levels by the FAO. It has also been found that the levels of iodine are also high in the vine. Fibre levels average approximately 33.4 g/100 g of dried ''Eru'' leaves, while recommended daily intake of fibre is 30 g. <U+2018><U+2018>Eru<U+2019><U+2018> has been noted as an anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic and antioxidant.<ref name="ali" />

Economically, ''Eru'' can be used as a means to maintain a supplemental income as it is available throughout the year,<ref>[http://www.cendep.org/index.htm Centre for Nursery Development and ''Eru'' Propagation, 2009.]</ref> and may be used as a form of supplementary income for rural farmers in Cameroon. Healthy leaves with a thick wax-like texture are preferred in markets and will receive the highest value; ''Eru'' remains untaxed in local markets.<ref name="tekwe" /> Since the leaves may be consumed as a vegetable and the root tuber as a famine food, it may also increase overall food security of rural households.

==Culture==
''Eru'' is most significantly cultivated by rural women farmers, constituting approximately 80% of the overall trade of this crop.<ref name="tekwe" /> While ''Eru'' is still largely considered a wild vegetable, if cultivated as a domesticated crop it may save time for women who previously would search for it in the forests.<ref name="Chindong" />
