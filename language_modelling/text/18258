The '''Nagorno-Karabakh War''' was an armed conflict that took place from February 1988 to May 1994, in the small [[enclave]] of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]<ref>The region's names in various languages tend to have the same approximate meaning. The name first originated in [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] sources in the 13th and 14th centuries. In Azerbaijani, the name of the region translates to "mountainous Karabakh [black garden]". Armenians also commonly refer to it as [[Artsakh]], an allusion to the tenth province of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]; the name is often seen shortened to simply Karabakh in news sources and books. Other languages such as Russian, French and German refer to the region, respectively, as ''Nagorny Karabakh'', ''Haut-Karabakh'' (Upper Karabakh) and ''Bergkarabach'' (Mountain-Karabach).</ref> in southwestern [[Azerbaijan]], between the majority ethnic [[Armenians]] of Nagorno-Karabakh backed by the [[Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan. As the war progressed, Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]], entangled themselves in a protracted, undeclared [[mountain warfare|war in the mountainous heights]] of Karabakh as Azerbaijan attempted to curb the [[secession]]ist movement in Nagorno-Karabakh. The [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh|enclave's parliament]] had voted in favor of uniting itself with Armenia and a referendum, boycotted by the Azerbaijanian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, was held, whereby the vast majority of the voters voted in favor of independence. The demand to unify with Armenia, which proliferated in the late 1980s, began in a relatively peaceful manner; however, in the following months, as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's disintegration]] neared, it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between ethnic Armenians and ethnic Azerbaijanis, resulting in claims of [[ethnic cleansing]] by all sides.<ref name=CASE-STUDY-IN-ETHNIC-STRIFE>{{cite journal

== Background ==
{{Main|History of Nagorno-Karabakh}}
The territorial ownership of Nagorno-Karabakh today is still heavily contested between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Called [[Artsakh]] by Armenians, its history spans over two millennia, during which it came under the control of several empires. The current conflict, however, has its roots in events following [[World War I]]. Shortly before the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s capitulation in the war, the [[Russian Empire]] collapsed in November 1917 and fell under the control of the [[Bolsheviks]]. The three nations of the [[Caucasus]], Armenia, Azerbaijan and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], previously under the rule of the Russians, declared their independence to form the [[Transcaucasian Federation]] which dissolved after only three months of existence.<ref name="dewaal">{{cite book

Fighting soon broke out between the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] and the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan]] in three specific regions: [[Nakhchevan]], Zangezur (today the Armenian province of [[Syunik]]) and Karabakh itself. Armenia and Azerbaijan quarreled as to where the boundaries would fall in accordance to the three provinces. The Karabakh Armenians attempted to declare their independence but failed to make contact with the Republic of Armenia.<ref name="dewaal"/> Following the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]], British troops occupied the [[South Caucasus]] in 1919. The British command provisionally affirmed Azerbaijani statesman [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]] as the governor-general of Karabakh and Zangezur, pending a final decision by the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the ROA.

Retrieved 2 March 2007.</ref>

=== Soviet division ===
Two months later however, the [[Soviet 11th Army]] invaded the Caucasus and within three years, the Caucasian republics were formed into the [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] of the Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks thereafter created a seven-member committee, the Caucasus Bureau (often shortened to ''Kavburo''). Under the supervision of the [[Narkomnats|People's Commissar for Nationalities]], the future Soviet ruler [[Joseph Stalin]], the Kavburo was tasked to head up matters in the Caucasus.<ref name="Karagiannis">{{cite book

==Revival of the Karabakh issue==
As the new [[general secretary]] of the Soviet Union, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], came to power in 1985, he began implementing his plans to reform the Soviet Union. These were encapsulated in two policies, ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]''. While ''perestroika'' had more to do with economic reform, ''glasnost'' or "openness" granted limited freedom to Soviet citizens to express grievances about the Soviet system itself and its leaders. Capitalizing on this new policy of Moscow, the leaders of the Regional Soviet of Karabakh decided to vote in favor of unifying the autonomous region with Armenia on 20 February 1988.<ref>{{cite book

The movement was spearheaded by popular Armenian figures and found support among intellectuals in Russia as well. According to journalist Thomas De Waal members of the Russian [[intelligentsia]], such as the dissident [[Andrei Sakharov]] expressed "rather simplistic support" for Armenians protesting on the streets of Yerevan due to the close relationships between Russian and Armenian intellectuals. However, Sakharov's opinion on Karabakh issue was controversial: at the beginning he took pro-Armenian stand shaped by his Armenian wife but later he proposed more complex ways for the solution of the conflict.<ref name="dewaal"/> More prominent support for the movement was perceived among the Moscow elite as well: in November 1987 ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'' published the personal comments made by [[Abel Aganbegyan]], an economic adviser to Gorbachev, to Armenians living in France, in which he suggested that Nagorno-Karabakh could be ceded to Armenia. Prior to the declaration, Armenians had begun to protest and stage workers' [[Strike action|strikes]] in Yerevan, demanding a unification with the enclave. This prompted Azeri counter-protests in [[Baku]].

After the demonstrations in Yerevan began to claim unification Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, Gorbachev met with two leaders of the Karabakh movement: Zori Balayan and Silvia Kaputikyan on 26 February 1988. Gorbachev asked them for a one-month moratorium on demonstrations. When Kaputikyan returned to Armenia the same evening, she told the crowds the "Armenians [had] triumphed" although Gorbachev hadn't made any concrete promises. On 10 March, According to Svante Cornell, this was an attempt to pressure Moscow.<ref name="Smallnations">Cornell, Svante E.

===Askeran and Sumgait===
{{Main|Askeran clash|Sumgait Pogrom}}
[[Image:Sumgaitrioting.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Images showing burnt automobiles and marauding rioters on the streets of the industrial city of [[Sumgait]] during the [[Sumgait Massacre|pogrom there]] in February 1988.]]
Ethnic infighting soon broke out between Armenians and Azerbaijanis living in Karabakh. As early as the end of 1987 [[Refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani refugees]] from the villages of [[Ghapan]] and [[Meghri]] in Armenia complained that they were forced to leave their homes as a result of tensions between their Armenian neighbors. In November 1987 two freight cars full of Azerbaijanis were said to have arrived at the train station in Baku. In later interviews, the mayors of the two villages denied that any such tension existed, although it has been argued that very little is known about the incidents because the authorities are alleged to have suppressed any information about it.<ref name="dewaal"/>

On 22 February 1988, a [[Askeran clash|direct confrontation]] between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, near the town of [[Askeran]] (located on the road between [[Stepanakert]] and [[Agdam]]) in Nagorno-Karabakh, degenerated into a skirmish. During the clashes two Azerbaijani youths were burned alive. One of them was probably shot by a local policeman, purportedly an Azerbaijani, either by accident or as a result of a quarrel.<ref name="dewaal"/><ref>{{Ru icon}} [http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/getashen/chapter1.htm Chronology of the conflict].

The [[Askeran clash]] was the prelude to pogroms in Sumgait, where emotions, already heightened by news about the Karabakh crisis, turned even uglier in a series of protests starting 27 February 1988. Speaking at the rallies, [[Azeris in Armenia|Azerbaijani refugees]] from the Armenian town of [[Ghapan]] accused Armenians of "murder and atrocities including raping women and cutting their breasts off".<ref name="Kaufman"/> According to the Soviet media these allegations were later disproved and many of the speakers were revealed to be [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]].<ref>{{ru icon}} Kulish, O. and Melikov, D. ''Socialist Industry''. 27 March 1988. Retrieved 30 March 2008.</ref> Within hours, a [[pogrom]] against Armenian residents began in Sumgait, a city some 25&nbsp;kilometers north of Baku.

On 23 March the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union rejected the demands of Armenians to cede Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. Troops were sent to Yerevan to prevent protests against the decision. Gorbachev's attempts to stabilize the region were to no avail, as both sides remained equally intransigent. In Armenia, there was a firm belief that what had taken place in the region of Nakhichevan would be repeated in Nagorno-Karabakh: prior to its absorption by Soviet Russia, it had a population which was 40% Armenian;<ref>{{cite book

Armenians refused to allow the issue to subside despite a compromise made by Gorbachev, which included a promise of a 400&nbsp;million-ruble package to introduce Armenian language textbooks and television programming in Karabakh. At the same time, Azerbaijan was unwilling to cede any territory to Armenia. Calls to transfer Karabakh to Armenia briefly subsided when a [[Spitak earthquake|devastating earthquake]] which hit Armenia on 7 December 1988, leveling the towns of Leninakan (now [[Gyumri]]) and [[Spitak]] and killing an estimated 25,000 people.<ref name="brothersroad"/> But conflict brewed up once more when the eleven members of the newly formed [[Karabakh Committee]], including the future president of Armenia [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]], were jailed by Moscow officials in the ensuing chaos of the earthquake. Such actions polarized relations between Armenia and the [[Kremlin]]; Armenians lost faith in Gorbachev, despising him even more because of his handling of the earthquake relief effort and his uncompromising stance on Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name="MakingofNK">{{cite book

===Black January===
{{Main|Black January}}
Inter-ethnic strife began to take a toll on both countries' populations, forcing most of the Armenians in Azerbaijan to flee to Armenia and most of the Azeris in Armenia to Azerbaijan.<ref name="Croissant"/> The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh had grown so out of hand that in January 1989 the central government in Moscow temporarily took control of the region, a move welcomed by many Armenians.<ref name="dewaal"/> In September 1989, [[Azerbaijan Popular Front|Popular Front]] leaders and their ever-increasing supporters managed to coordinate a [[railway]] [[blockade]] against Armenia and the NKAO, effectively crippling Armenia's economy, as 85% of the cargo and goods arrived through rail traffic,<ref name="Croissant"/> although some claim this was a response to Armenia's embargo against [[Nakhichevan ASSR]] that had started earlier that summer.<ref name="cornell"/> The disruption of rail service to Armenia was, accordingly, in part due to the attacks of Armenian militants on Azerbaijani train crews entering Armenia, who then began refusing to do so.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

In January 1990, [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|another pogrom directed at Armenians]] in Baku forced Gorbachev to declare a state of emergency and send MVD troops to restore order. Amid the rising independence movement in Azerbaijan, Gorbachev dispatched the military to dragoon the events, as the Soviet regime inched closer to collapse.

===Fighting in Qazakh===
Azerbaijan has several enclaves within the territory of Armenia: [[Yuxar<U+0131> <U+018F>skipara|Yukhari Askipara]], [[Barxudarl<U+0131>|Barkhudarli]] and [[Sofulu, Qazakh|Sofulu]] in the northwest and an exclave of [[Karki, Azerbaijan|Karki]] in the [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] exclave of Azerbaijan Republic. In early 1990, the road alongside the border village of [[Baganis]] came under routine attack by militia members from Azerbaijan.<ref name="Cullen">Cullen, Robert. "A Reporter at Large, Roots." ''[[The New Yorker]]''. 15 April 1991.</ref> At the same time, Armenian forces attacked both these Azerbaijani enclaves within the Armenian territory and border villages of [[Qazakh Rayon|Qazakh]] and [[Sadarak Rayon|Sadarak]] rayon in Azerbaijan proper. On 26 March 1990 several cars with Armenian paramilitaries arrived in the Armenian border village of [[Baganis]]. At dusk, they crossed the border storming the Azerbaijani village [[Ba<U+011F>anis Ayrum]]. About 20 houses were burned and 8 to 11 Azerbaijani villagers killed.<ref name="<U+0410><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+043F><U+0430><U+0440>"/>  The bodies of members of one family, including infants, were found in the charred ruins of their burned homes.

=== Operation Ring ===
{{Main|Operation Ring}}
In the spring of 1991, President Gorbachev held a special countrywide referendum called the [[Union of Soviet Sovereign Republics|Union Treaty]] which would decide if the Soviet republics would remain together. Newly elected, non-communist leaders had come to power in the Soviet republics, including [[Boris Yeltsin]] in Russia (Gorbachev remained the [[President of the Soviet Union]]), Levon Ter-Petrosyan in Armenia and [[Ayaz Mutalibov]] in Azerbaijan. Armenia and five other republics boycotted the referendum (Armenia would hold its own referendum and declared its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on 21 September 1991), whereas Azerbaijan voted in compliance to the Treaty.<ref name="Croissant"/>

As many Armenians and Azeris in Karabakh began an arms build up (by acquiring weaponry located in caches throughout Karabakh) in order to defend themselves, Mutalibov turned to Gorbachev for support in launching a joint military operation in order to disarm Armenian militants in the region. Termed ''[[Operation Ring]]'', the operation forcibly deported Armenians living in the villages of the region of [[Shahumian|Shahumyan]]. It was perceived by both Soviet and Armenian government officials as a method of intimidating the Armenian populace to giving up their demands for unification.<ref name="Croissant"/>

Operation ''Ring'' proved counter-productive to what it had originally sought to accomplish. Its violent character only reinforced the belief among Armenians that the only solution to the Karabakh conflict was through outright armed resistance. The initial Armenian resistance inspired volunteers to start forming irregular volunteer detachments.<ref name="dewaal"/>

=== First attempt to mediate peace ===

First peace mediation efforts were started by the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin and [[Kazakhstan]] President, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] in September 1991.

===Conflict in the last days of the USSR===
In late 1991, Armenian militias launched offensives to capture Armenian populated villages seized by Azerbaijani [[Special Purpose Police Unit (Azerbaijan)|OMON]] in May<U+2013>July 1991. Leaving these villages, the Azerbaijani units in some cases burned them<ref name=memo/>. According to the Moscow-based Human Rights organization Memorial, at the same time, as a result of attacks by Armenian armed forces several thousand residents of Azerbaijani villages in the former Shahumian, Hadrut, Martakert, Askeran, Martuni rayons of Azerbaijan had to leave their homes too. Some villages (e.g., Imereti, Gerevent) were burned by the militants. There were instances of serious violence against the civilian population (in particular, in the village [[Me<U+015F><U+0259>li, Goranboy|Meshali]]).<ref name=memo>{{ru icon}} "[http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/HOJALY/Chapter1.htm#_VPID_5 <U+0414><U+043E><U+043A><U+043B><U+0430><U+0434> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0430><U+0432><U+043E><U+0437><U+0430><U+0449><U+0438><U+0442><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0446><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430> <U+00AB><U+041C><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+00BB> <U+043E> <U+043C><U+0430><U+0441><U+0441><U+043E><U+0432><U+044B><U+0445> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0440><U+0443><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F><U+0445> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0430><U+0432> <U+0447><U+0435><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043A><U+0430>, <U+0441><U+0432><U+044F><U+0437><U+0430><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0445> <U+0441> <U+0437><U+0430><U+043D><U+044F><U+0442><U+0438><U+0435><U+043C> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0443><U+043D><U+043A><U+0442><U+0430> <U+0425><U+043E><U+0434><U+0436><U+0430><U+043B><U+044B> <U+0432> <U+043D><U+043E><U+0447><U+044C> <U+0441> 25 <U+043D><U+0430> 26 <U+0444><U+0435><U+0432><U+0440><U+0430><U+043B><U+044F> 1992 <U+0433>. <U+0432><U+043E><U+043E><U+0440><U+0443><U+0436><U+0451><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+043C><U+0438> <U+0444><U+043E><U+0440><U+043C><U+0438><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F><U+043C><U+0438>]."

==Weapons vacuum==
As the [[disintegration of the Soviet Union]] became a reality for Soviet citizens in the autumn of 1991, both sides sought to acquire weaponry from military caches located throughout Karabakh. The initial advantage tilted in Azerbaijan's favor. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet military doctrine for defending the Caucasus had outlined a strategy where Armenia would be a combat zone in the case [[NATO]] member Turkey invaded from the west. Thus, in the Armenian SSR only three [[Division (military)|division]]s and no [[airfields]] had been established while Azerbaijan had a total of five divisions and five military airfields. Furthermore, Armenia had approximately 500 [[railroad cars]] of [[ammunition]] in comparison to Azerbaijan's 10,000.<ref>Petrosian, David. "What Are the Reasons for Armenians' Success in the Military Phase of the Karabakh Conflict?" ''Noyan Tapan Highlights''. 1 June 2000.</ref>

As MVD forces began pulling out, they bequeathed the Armenians and Azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored [[armor]]ed vehicles. The government forces initially sent by Gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of the Soviet Union and many had no wish to remain any longer. Most were poor, young [[conscript]]s and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side, some even trying to sell tanks and [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). The unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame and mock Gorbachev's policies as the ultimate cause of the conflict.<ref name="timestepanakert">

Further evidence also showed that Azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from [[Israel]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and numerous [[Arab]] countries.<ref name="brothersroad" /> Most weaponry was Russian-made or came from the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries; however, some improvisation was made by both sides. The [[Armenian Diaspora]] managed to donate a significant amount of money to be sent to Armenia and even managed to push for legislation in the [[United States Congress]] to pass a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] entitled Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act in response to Azerbaijan's blockade against Armenia, restricting a complete ban on military aid from the United States to Azerbaijan in 1992.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Section_907&action=submit#Text_of_the_Public_Law_107-115 Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act]. Humanitarian aid was not explicitly banned but such supplies had to be routed through indirectly to aid organizations. On 25 January 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a waiver that effectively repealed Section 907, thereby removing any restrictions that were barring the United States from sending military aid to Azerbaijan; however, military parity is maintained towards both sides. For more information, see here [http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020130-6.html]. Azerbaijan continues to maintain their road and air blockade against Armenia.</ref> While Azerbaijan charged that the Russians were initially helping the Armenians, it was said that "the Azeri fighters in the region [were] far better equipped with Soviet military weaponry than their opponents."<ref name="timestepanakert"/>

With Gorbachev resigning as Soviet General-Secretary on 26 December 1991, the remaining republics including [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]] declared their independence and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on 31 December 1991. This dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping Armenia and Azerbaijan from waging a full scale war. One month prior, on 21 November, the Azerbaijani Parliament rescinded Karabakh's status as an autonomous region and renamed its capital "Xankandi." In response, on 10 December, a referendum was held in Karabakh by parliamentary leaders (with the local Azeri community boycotting it) where the Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. On 6 January 1992, the region declared its independence from Azerbaijan.<ref name="Croissant"/>

The withdrawal of the Soviet interior forces from Nagorno-Karabakh in the Caucasus region was only temporary. By February 1992, the former Soviet states were consolidated as the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). While Azerbaijan abstained from joining, Armenia, fearing a possible invasion by Turkey in the escalating conflict, entered the CIS which would have protected it under a "collective security umbrella". In January 1992, the CIS forces then moved in and established a headquarters at Stepanakert and took up a slightly more active role in peacekeeping, incorporating old units including the 366<sup>th</sup> Motorized Rifle Regiment and [[Soviet Fourth Army|4<sup>th</sup> Army]].<ref name="Karagiannis"/>

==Building armies==

The sporadic battles between Armenians and Azeris had intensified after Operation Ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia, a recurrent and popular theme at the time compared and idolized the separatist fighters to historical Armenian [[guerrilla]] groups and revered individuals such as [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Garegin Njdeh]], who fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name="dewaal"/> In addition to the government's conscription of males aged 18<U+2013>45, many Armenians volunteered to fight and formed ''tchokats'', or detachments, of about forty men, which combined with several others were under the command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]]. Initially, many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf, rarely with any oversight, when attacking or defending areas.<ref name="brothersroad"/> Direct insubordination was common as many of the men simply did not show up, looted the bodies of dead soldiers and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

Many women enlisted in the Armenian military, taking part in the fighting as well as serving in auxiliary roles such as providing [[first-aid]] and evacuating wounded men from the battlefield.

Azerbaijan's military functioned in much the same manner; however, it was better organized during the first years of the war. The Azeri government also carried out conscription and many Azeris enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed. Azerbaijan's National Army consisted of roughly 30,000 men, in addition to nearly 10,000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front. [[Suret Huseynov]], a wealthy Azeri, also improvised by creating his own military brigade, the 709<sup>th</sup> of the Azerbaijani Army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division's arsenal.<ref name="dewaal"/> [[<U+0130>sgandar Hamidov]]'s ''bozqurt'' or [[Grey Wolves]] brigade also mobilized for action. The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its [[oil field]] assets on and near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name="Gurdelik">

Former troops of the Soviet Union also offered their services to either side. For example, one of the most prominent officers to serve on the Armenian side was former Soviet General [[Anatoly Zinevich]], who remained in Nagorno-Karabakh for five years (1992<U+2013>1997) and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of the Armenian forces. By the end of war he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) armed forces.

In an overall military comparison, the number of men eligible for military service in Armenia, in the age group of 17<U+2013>32, totaled 550,000, while in Azerbaijan it was 1.3&nbsp;million. Most men from both sides had served in the [[Soviet Army]] and so had some form of military experience prior to the conflict, including [[Soviet war in Afganistan|tours of duty in Afghanistan]].

Officially, the newly created [[Republic of Armenia]] publicly denied any involvement in providing any [[weapons]], [[fuel]], [[food]], or other [[logistics]] to the secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, Ter-Petrosyan later did admit to supplying them with logistical supplies and paying the salaries of the separatists but denied sending any of its own men to combat. Armenia faced a debilitating blockade by the now [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] as well as pressure from neighboring Turkey, which decided to side with Azerbaijan and build a closer relationship with it.<ref>{{cite book

The region's only airport was in the small town of [[Khojali (city)|Khojaly]], which was seven kilometers north of Stepanakert with an estimated population of 6,000<U+2013>10,000 people. Additionally, Khojaly had been serving as an artillery base and since 23 February, was shelling Armenian and Russian units in the capital.<ref name="Kaufman"/> By late February, Khojaly had largely been cut off. On 26 February, Armenian forces, with the aid of some of armored vehicles from the 366<sup>th</sup>, mounted an offensive to capture Khojaly.

According to the Azerbaijani side and the affirmation of other sources including [[Human Rights Watch]], the Moscow based human rights organization [[Memorial (society)|Memorial]] and the biography of a leading Armenian commander, [[Monte Melkonian]], documented and published by his brother,<ref name="melkonian">Melkonian. ''My Brother's Road'', p. 213.</ref> after Armenian forces captured Khojaly, they proceeded to kill several hundred civilians evacuating from the town. Armenian forces had previously stated they would attack the city and leave a land corridor for them to escape through. However, when the attack began, the attacking Armenian force easily outnumbered and overwhelmed the defenders who along with the civilians attempted to retreat north to the Azeri held city of Agdam. The airport's runway was found to have been intentionally destroyed, rendering it temporarily useless. The attacking forces then went on to pursue those fleeing through the corridor and opened fire upon them, killing scores of civilians.<ref name="melkonian" /> Facing charges of an intentional massacre of civilians by international groups, Armenian government officials denied the occurrence of a massacre and asserted an objective of silencing the artillery coming from Khojaly.<ref>The Armenian

[[File:Ridge Shushi battle.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The road leading up to Shusha was the scene of a famous fighting engagement between Armenian and Azerbaijani armored vehicles.]]
When Armenians launched one of the first offensives, at Stepanakert on 13 February 1988, many Azerbaijanis fled to the stronghold of [[Shusha]]. On 28 March Azerbaijani side by deploying attack on Stepanakert, from the village Dzhangasan attacked enemy positions above the village [[K<U+0259>rkicahan|Kirkidzhan]], and in the afternoon the next day took up positions in close proximity to the city, but were quickly repulsed by the Armenians.<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite news | title=<U+0412><U+0435><U+0441><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0435><U+0435> <U+043E><U+0436><U+0438><U+0432><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+041D><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0445><U+0435> |publisher=''Kommersant'' | url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?fromsearch=8ee300c2-1d04-4f51-b932-9a580cb38550&docsid=4073| date=06.04.1992}}</ref>

In the ensuing months after the capture of Khojaly, Azeri commanders holding out in the region's last bastion of Shusha began a large scale artillery bombardment with [[BM-21|GRAD]] rocket launchers against Stepanakert. By April, the shelling had forced many of the 50,000 people living in Stepanakert to seek refuge in underground bunkers and basements.<ref name="timestepanakert"/> Facing ground incursions near the city's outlying areas, military leaders in Nagorno-Karabakh organized an offensive to take the town.

On 8 May, a force of several hundred Armenian troops accompanied by tanks and helicopters attacked the Azeri citadel of Shusha. Fierce fighting took place in the town's streets and several hundred men were killed on both sides. Overwhelmed by the numerically superior fighting force, the Azeri commander in Shusha ordered a retreat and fighting ended on 9 May.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

The capture of Shusha resonated loudly in neighboring Turkey. Its relations with Armenia had grown better after it had declared its independence from the Soviet Union; however, they gradually worsened as a result of Armenia's gains in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Turkey's prime minister, [[Suleyman Demirel]] said that he was under intense pressure by his people to have his country intervene and aid Azerbaijan. Demirel, however, was opposed to such an intervention, saying that Turkey's entrance into the war would trigger an even greater Muslim-Christian conflict (Turks are overwhelmingly Muslims).<ref>{{cite book

Turkey never did actively contribute troops to Azerbaijan but did send a great deal of military aid and advisers. In May 1992, the military commander of the CIS forces, Marshal [[Yevgeny Shaposhnikov]], issued a warning to Western nations, especially the United States, to not interfere with the conflict in the Caucasus, stating it would "place us [the Commonwealth] on the verge of a third world war and that cannot be allowed."<ref name="Croissant"/>

A [[Chechnya|Chechen]] contingent, led by [[Shamil Basayev]], was one of the units to participate in the conflict. According to Azeri Colonel Azer Rustamov, in 1992, "hundreds of Chechen volunteers rendered us invaluable help in these battles led by Shamil Basayev and Salman Raduev."<ref name="ArmenianWeekly">[[Khatchig Mouradian|Mouradian, Khatchig]].

=== Sealing Lachin ===
[[Image:MovingtoLachin.jpg|thumb|290px|left|Armenian forces in the May 1992 move in to secure the [[Lachin corridor]]. The capture of Lachin allowed Armenia to send in supply convoys to aid the Karabakh separatists and also opened up a route for Armenian refugees to evacuate through.]]

The loss of Shusha led the Azeri parliament to lay the blame on Mamedov, which removed him from power and cleared Mutalibov of any responsibility after the loss of Khojaly, reinstating him as President on 15 May 1992. Many Azeris saw this act as a [[coup]] in addition to the cancellation of the parliamentary elections slated in June of that year. The Azeri parliament at that time was made up of former leaders from the country's communist regime and the losses of Khojaly and Shusha only aggrandized their desires for free elections.<ref name="Croissant"/>

To contribute to the turmoil, an offensive was launched by Armenian forces on 18 May to take the city of [[Lachin]] in the narrow corridor separating Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. The city itself was poorly guarded and, within the next day, Armenian forces took control of the town and cleared any remaining Azeris to open the road that linked the region to Armenia. The taking of the city then allowed an overland route to be connected with Armenia itself with supply convoys beginning to trek up the mountainous region of Lachin to Karabakh.<ref name="Crossroads">{{cite book

The loss of Lachin was the final blow to Mutalibov's regime. Demonstrations were held despite Mutalibov's ban and an armed coup was staged by Popular Front activists. Fighting between government forces and Popular Front supporters escalated as the political opposition seized the parliament building in Baku as well as the airport and presidential office. On 16 June 1992, [[Abulfaz Elchibey]] was elected leader of Azerbaijan with many political leaders from the [[Azerbaijan Popular Front Party]] were elected into the parliament. The instigators characterized Mutalibov as an undedicated and weak leader in the war in Karabakh. Elchibey was staunchly against receiving any help from the Russians, instead favoring closer ties to Turkey.<ref>{{cite book

==Escalation==
===Operation Goranboy===
{{Main|Operation Goranboy}}
Operation Goranboy was a large scale Azerbaijani offensive in the summer of 1992 aimed at taking control over the entire Nagorno-Karabakh and putting a decisive end to the resistance. This offensive is regarded as the only successful breakthrough by the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces|Azeri Army]] and marks the peak of Azerbaraijani success in the entirety of the six-year long conflict. It also marks the beginning of a new, more intense, phase of the war. Over 8,000 Azeri troops and four additional [[battalion]]s, at least 90 tanks and 70 [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s, as well as [[Mi-24]] [[Attack helicopter|attack-helicopters]] were used in this operation.

On 12 June 1992, the Azeri military first launched a large scale diversionary attack in the direction of the [[Askeran|Askeran region]] at the center of Nagorno-Karabakh. Two groups of Azeris totaling 4,000 troops attacked the positions to the north and south of Askeran. As a result of fierce fighting Azeris managed to establish control over some settlements in Askeran region: [[Nakhichevanik]], [[Dov<U+015F>anl<U+0131>|Arachadzor]], [[Pirdzhamal]], [[Dahraz]] and [[A<U+011F>bulaq, Khojali|Agbulak]]. On 4 July 1992, Azeris captured the largest town in the region, [[Mardakert (town)|Mardakert]].

The scale of the Azeri offensive prompted the Armenian government to openly threaten Azerbaijan that it would overtly intervene and assist the separatists fighting in Karabakh.<ref>{{cite news

An estimated 30,000 Armenian refugees were also forced to flee to the capital as the assaulting forces had taken back nearly half of Nagorno-Karabakh.

However, the thrust made by the Azeris ground to a halt when their armor was driven off by helicopter gunships.<ref name="dewaal"/> It was claimed that many of the crew members of the armored units in the Azeri launched assault were Russians from the 104<sup>th</sup> Guards [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne]] Division based out of Ganja and, ironically enough, so were the units who eventually stopped them. According to an Armenian government official, they were able to persuade Russian military units to bombard and effectively halt the advance within a few days. This allowed the Armenian government to recuperate for the losses and reorganize a [[counteroffensive]] to restore the original lines of the front.<ref name="dewaal"/> Given the reorganization of the NKR Defense Army, the tide of Azeri advances was finally stopped. By the autumn of 1992, the Azerbaijani army was exhausted and suffered heavy loses, and in February<U+2013>March of the following year, the NKR Defense Army helped turn the tide into an unprecedented wave of advances.

===Subsequent attempts to mediate peace===
New peace mediation efforts were initiated by the Iranian President, [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] in the first half of 1992. First attempts by Iran to mediate a ceasefire were previously disrupted by [[Nagorno-Karabakh_War#Khojaly|massacre of Khojaly]]. However, after conducting ''shuttle diplomacy'' in Armenia and Azerbaijan for several weeks, Iranian authorities were able to bring President of Azerbaijan, [[Yaqub Mammadov]] and President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrosian to Tehran for bilateral talks on 7 May 1992.<ref name=Strategic>{{cite web|url=http://www.csr.ir/departments.aspx?lng=en&abtid=07&depid=74&semid=989 |title= Mediation in the Karabakh Dispute |author= Dr. Mahmood Vaezi.

In the summer of 1992, the CSCE (later to become the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]), created the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] in [[Helsinki]] which comprised eleven nations and was co-chaired by [[France]], Russia and the United States with the purpose of mediating a peace deal with Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, in their annual summit in 1992, the organization failed to address and solve the many new problems that had arisen since the Soviet Union collapsed, much less the Karabakh conflict. The [[war in Yugoslavia]], [[Moldova]]'s war with the breakaway republic of [[Transnistria]], the growing desire for independence from Russia by [[Chechnya|Chechen]] separatists and Georgia's renewed disputes with Russia, [[Abkhazia]] and [[Ossetia]] were all top agenda issues that involved various ethnic groups fighting each other.<ref>{{cite book

The CSCE proposed the use of NATO and CIS [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to monitor ceasefires and protect shipments of humanitarian aid being sent to displaced refugees. Several ceasefires were put into effect after the June offensive but the implementation of a European peacekeeping force, endorsed by Armenia, never came to fruition. The idea of sending 100 international observers to Karabakh was once raised but talks broke down completely between Armenian and Azeri leaders in July. Russia was especially opposed to allowing a multinational peacekeeping force from NATO to entering the Caucasus, seeing it as a move that encroached on its "backyard".<ref name="Croissant"/>

===Mardakert and Martuni Offensives===
{{Main|Mardakert and Martuni Offensives}}
In late June, a new, smaller Azeri offensive was planned, this time against the town of [[Martuni]] in the southeastern half of Karabakh. The attack force consisted of several dozen tanks and armored fighting vehicles along with a complement of several infantry companies massing along the [[Machkalashen]] and Jardar fronts near Martuni and [[Krasnyy Bazar]]. Martuni's regimental commander, Monte Melkonian, referred now by his men as "Avo", although lacking heavy armor, managed to stave off repeated attempts by the Azeri forces.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

In late August 1992, Nagorno-Karabakh's government found itself in a disorderly state and its members resigned on 17 August. Power was subsequently assumed by a council called the State Defense Committee which was chaired by [[Robert Kocharyan]], stating it would temporarily govern the enclave until the conflict ended.<ref name="dewaal"/> At the same time, Azerbaijan also launched attacks by fixed-wing aircraft, often bombing civilian targets. Kocharyan condemned what he believed were intentional attempts to kill civilians by the Azeris and also Russia's alleged passive and unconcerned attitude towards allowing its army's weapons stockpiles to be sold or transferred to Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite news

The pilots claimed that their Azerbaijani commanders outlined the air strikes to explicitly target civilian rather than military targets, thereby instowing panic upon the city's populace: {{ru icon}} ''<U+0420><U+0443><U+0441><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0435><U+043C><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0435><U+0432><U+0430><U+0432><U+0448><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0445><U+0435>''.

===Winter thaw===
As the winter of 1992 approached, both sides largely abstained from launching full scale offensives so as to reserve resources, such as gas and electricity, for domestic use. Despite the opening of an economic highway to the residents living in Karabakh, both Armenia and the enclave suffered a great deal due to the economic blockades imposed by Azerbaijan. While not completely shut off, material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically.<ref name="Croissant"/>

Experiencing both food shortages and power shortages, after the close down of the [[Metsamor]] nuclear power plant, Armenia's economic outlook appeared bleak: in Georgia, a new bout of civil wars against separatists in Abkhazia and Ossetia began, who raided supply convoys and repeatedly destroyed the only oil pipeline leading from Russia to Armenia. Similar to the winter of 1991<U+2013>1992, the 1992<U+2013>1993 winter was especially cold, as many families throughout Armenia and Karabakh were left without heating and hot water.<ref name="Leonidas">{{cite book

Other goods such as grain were more difficult to procure. The international Armenian Diaspora raised money and donated supplies for Armenia. In December, two shipments of 33,000 tons of grain and 150 tons of infant formula arrived from the United States via the [[Black Sea]] port of [[Batumi]], Georgia.<ref name="Leonidas"/> In February 1993, the [[European Community]] sent 4.5&nbsp;million [[European Currency Unit|ECU]]s to Armenia.<ref name="Leonidas"/> Armenia's southern neighbor Iran, also helped Armenia economically by providing power and electricity. Elchibey's oppositional stance against Iran and his remarks to unify with Iran's Azeri minority alienated relations between the two.

Azeris displaced as [[internally displaced person|internal]] and international [[refugee]]s were forced to live in makeshift camps provided by both the Azerbaijan government and Iran. The [[International Red Cross]] also distributed blankets to the Azeris and noted that by December, enough food was being allocated for the refugees.<ref>

Its oil refineries were not generating at full capacity and production quotas fell well short of estimates. In 1965, the oil fields in Baku were producing 21.5&nbsp;million tons of oil annually; by 1988, that number had dropped down to almost 3.3&nbsp;million. Outdated Soviet refinery equipment and a reluctance by Western oil companies to invest in a war region where pipelines would routinely be destroyed prevented Azerbaijan from fully exploiting its oil wealth.<ref name="Croissant"/>

==Summer 1993==
===Conflicts===
Despite the grueling winter both countries had suffered, the new year was viewed enthusiastically by both sides. Azerbaijan's President Elchibey expressed optimism towards bringing an agreeable solution to the conflict with Armenia's Ter-Petrosyan. Glimmers of such hope, however, quickly began to fade in January 1993, despite the calls for a new ceasefire by [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], as hostilities in the region brewed up once more.<ref>

Frustration over these military defeats took a toll in the domestic front in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan's military had grown more desperate and defense minister Gaziev and Huseynov's brigade turned to Russian help, a move which ran against Elchibey's policies construable as insubordination. Political infighting and arguments on where to shift military units between the country's ministry of the interior [[<U+0130>sgandar Hamidov]] and Gaziev led to the latter's resignation on 20 February. A political shakeup also occurred in Armenia when Ter-Petrosyan dismissed the country's prime minister, Khosrov Arutyunyan and his cabinet for failing to implement a viable economic plan for the country. Protests by Armenians against Ter-Petrosyan's leadership were also suppressed and put down.<ref>{{cite news

===Kelbajar===
{{Main|Battle of Kelbajar}}
{{stack|[[Image:Captured azeri tank.jpg|thumb|230px|An Armenian engineer repairing a captured Azeri tank. Note the crescent emblem on the turret of the tank.]]}}

Situated west of northern Karabakh, out of the boundaries of the region, was the ''[[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|rayon]]'' of [[Kalbajar|Kelbajar]] which bordered alongside Armenia. With a population of about 60,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azeris and [[Kurds]].<ref name="HRW">See Human Rights Watch/Helsinki. ''Azerbaijan: Seven Years of Conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh''. New York: Human Rights Watch, 1994.</ref>
In March 1993, the Armenian-held areas near the [[Sarsang reservoir]] in [[Mardakert]] were reported to have been coming under attack by the Azeris. After successfully defending the Martuni region, Melkonian's fighters were tasked to move to capture the region of Kelbajar, where the incursions and purported artillery shelling were said to have been coming from.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

Scant military opposition by the Azeris allowed Melkonian's fighters to quickly gain a foothold in the region and also captured several abandoned armored vehicles and tanks. At 2:45&nbsp;pm, on 2 April, Armenian forces from two different directions advanced towards Kelbajar in an attack that quickly struck against Azeri armor and troops entrenched near the Ganje-Kelbjar intersection. Azeri forces were unable to halt advances made by Armenian armor units and nearly all died defending the area. The second attack towards Kelbajar also quickly overran the defenders. By 3 April, Armenian forces had captured Kelbajar.<ref name="brothersroad"/> President Elchibey imposed a state of emergency for a period of two months and introduced universal conscription.

The offensive provoked international rancor against the Armenian government, marking the first time Armenian forces had crossed the boundaries of the enclave itself and into Azerbaijan's territory. On 30 April, the [[United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council (UNSC)]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|Resolution 822]], co-sponsored by Turkey and [[Pakistan]], affirming Nagorno-Karabakh as part of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and demanding that Armenian forces withdraw from Kelbajar.<ref name="UN">
[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm#822 United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 passed on 30 April 1993]. A total of four UNSC resolutions were passed in regards to the conflict.</ref>
[[Human Rights Watch]] findings concluded that during the Kelbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and taking hostages.<ref name="HRW"/>

The political repercussions were also felt in Azerbaijan when Huseynov embarked on his "march to Baku" from Ganje. Frustrated with what he felt was Elchibey's incompetence in dealing with the conflict and demoted from his rank of colonel, his brigade advanced towards Baku to unseat the President in early June. Elchibey stepped down from office on 18 June and power was assumed by then parliamentary member Heydar Aliyev. On 1 July, Huseynov was appointed prime minister of Azerbaijan.<ref>"[http://www.thestar.com/ Rebel troops push toward Azeri capital]." ''[[Toronto Star]]''. 21 June 1993, p.

===Agdam, Fizuli, Jabrail and Zangilan===
{{Main|1993 Summer Offensives}}
[[File:Agdam-nagorno-karabakh-3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ruins of Agdam (2009)]]
While the people of Azerbaijan were adjusting to the new political landscape, many Armenians were coping with the death of Melkonian who was killed earlier on 12 June in a skirmish near the town of Merzuli as his death was publicly mourned at a national level in Yerevan. The Armenian forces exploited the political crisis in Baku, which had left the Karabakh front almost undefended by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name="dewaal"/> The following four months of political instability in Azerbaijan led to the loss of control over five districts, as well as the north of Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name="dewaal"/> Azerbaijani military forces were unable to put up much resistance to Armenian advances and left most of the areas without any serious fighting.<ref name="dewaal"/> In late June, they were driven out from Martakert, losing their final foothold of the enclave. By July, the Armenian forces were preparing to attack and capture the region of [[Agdam Rayon|Agdam]], another rayon nestled outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, claiming that they were attempting to bolster a greater [[Security belt of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|barrier]] to keep Azeri artillery out of range.<ref>The genuineness of the NKR's claims during the 1993 summer offensives were widely questioned in the international forum on whether or not Karabakh forces were wantonly seizing the territories surrounding the enclave. While many doubted that they were true, periodic fighting between the two sides in the regions was reported to have been occurring months before the offensives took place.</ref>

On 4 July, an artillery bombardment was commenced by Armenian forces against the region's capital of Agdam, destroying many parts of the town. Soldiers, along with the civilians began to evacuate Agdam. Facing a military collapse, Aliev attempted to mediate with the [[de-facto]] Karabakh government and Minsk Group officials. In mid-August, Armenians massed a force to take the Azeri regions of [[Fizuli]] and [[Jabrayil|Jebrail]], south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper.

In light of the Armenians' advance into Azerbaijan, Turkey's prime minister [[Tansu <U+00C7>iller]], warned the Armenian government not to attack Nakhichevan and demanded that Armenians pull out of Azerbaijan's territories. Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September. Russian Federation forces in Armenia countered their movements and thus warded off any possibility that Turkey might play a military role in the conflict.<ref>During the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], one of the coup's leaders against Russian President Yeltsin, [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], was reported by the US and French intelligence agencies to preparing Russian troop withdrawals from Armenia if the coup succeeded. An estimated 23,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Armenia on the border of Turkey. <U+00C7>iller was reported by the agencies to be collaborating with Khasbulatov for him to give her tacit support in allowing possible military incursions by Turkey into Armenia under the pretext of pursuing [[PKK]] guerrillas, an act it had once followed up on earlier the same year in northern [[Iraq]]. Russian armed forces, however, crushed the coup.</ref>

By early September, Azeri forces were nearly in complete disarray. Many of the heavy weapons they had received and bought from the Russians were either taken out of action or abandoned during the battles. Since the June 1992 offensive, Armenian forces had captured dozens of tanks, light armor and artillery from the Azeri forces. For example, according to Monte Melkonian in a television interview in March 1993, his forces in Martuni alone had captured or destroyed a total of 55 [[T-72]]s, 24 [[BMP-2]]s, 15 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s and 25 pieces of heavy artillery since the June 1992 Azeri offensive, stating that "most of our arms...[were] captured from Azerbaijan."<ref name="brothersroad"/> [[Serzh Sargsyan]], the then military leader of the Karabakh armed forces claimed they had captured a total of 156 tanks throughout the war.<ref name="dewaal"/> By the summer of 1993, Armenian forces had captured so much equipment that many of them were praising Elchibey's war policies since he was, in effect, arming both sides.<ref name="brothersroad"/>

Further signs of Azerbaijan's desperation included the recruitment by Aliev of 1,000<U+2013>1,500 [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] and Arab [[mujahadeen]] fighters from [[Afghanistan]]. Although the Azerbaijani government denied this claim, correspondence and photographs captured by Armenian forces indicated otherwise.<ref name="Croissant"/> Other sources of foreign help arrived from Pakistan and also Chechnya including guerilla fighter [[Shamil Basayev]].<ref>Vartanyan, Arkady.

The aerial warfare in Karabakh involved primarily [[fighter jets]] and attack helicopters. The primary transport helicopters of the war were the [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] and its cousin, the [[Mi-17]] and were used extensively by both sides. Armenia's active air force consisted of only two [[Su-25]] ground support bombers, one of which was lost due to [[friendly fire]]. There were also several [[Su-22]]s and [[Su-17]]s; however, these aging craft took a backseat for the duration of the war.<ref name="Topguns">

Azerbaijan's air force was composed of forty-five combat aircraft which were often piloted by experienced Russian and [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[mercenaries]] from the former Soviet military. They flew mission sorties over Karabakh with such sophisticated jets as the [[Mig-25]] and [[Sukhoi Su-24]] and with older-generation Soviet [[fighter bomber]]s, such as the [[Mig-21]]. They were reported to have been paid a monthly salary of over 5,000 [[Soviet ruble|ruble]]s and flew bombing campaigns from air force bases in Azerbaijan often targeting Stepanakert.<ref name="Topguns">

These pilots, like the men from the Soviet interior forces in the onset of the conflict, were also poor and took the jobs as a means of supporting their families. Several were shot down over the city by Armenian forces and according to one of the pilots' commanders, with assistance provided by the Russians. Many of these pilots faced the threat of execution by Armenian forces if they were shot down. The setup of the defense system severely hampered Azerbaijan's ability to carry out and launch more air strikes.<ref name="Topguns"/> The most widely used [[helicopter gunship]] by both the Armenians and Azeris was the Soviet-made [[Mil Mi-24|Mil Mi-24 Krokodil]].<ref>Under the protocols of the Tashkent Agreement signed in [[Uzbekistan]] in May 1992, the former Soviet republics were allocated a certain number of tanks, armored vehicles and combat aircraft. The agreement allowed Armenia and Azerbaijan to have a total of 100 aircraft. The Armenian Air Force currently possesses a fleet of 12 Mil Mi-24s gunships, 9 [[Mil Mi-2]]s and 13 [[Mil Mi-8]]s transport helicopters. Azerbaijan's air force has a near-similar fleet of 15 Mil Mi-24s, 7 Mil Mi-2, 15 [[Mil Mi-6]] and 13 Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters.</ref>

==1993<U+2013>1994 attack waves==
[[Image:Location Nagorno-Karabakh en.png|thumb|320px|The final borders of the conflict after the 1994 ceasefire was signed.

In October 1993, Aliev was formally elected as President and promised to bring social order to the country in addition to recapturing the lost regions. In October, Azerbaijan joined the CIS. The winter season was marked with similar conditions as in the previous year, both sides scavenging for wood and harvesting foodstuffs months in advance. Two subsequent [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|UNSC resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] were passed, (874 and 884), in October and November and, although reemphasizing the same points as the previous two, they acknowledged Nagorno-Karabakh as a party to the conflict.<ref name="UN"/>

In early January, Azerbaijani forces and Afghan guerrillas recaptured part of the [[Fizuli]] district, including the railway junction of Horadiz on the Iranian border, but failed to recapture the town of Fizuli itself.<ref name="UnholyWars">{{cite book

The offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of Karabakh in the north and to the south of but soon stalled. The Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to stop Azerbaijani advancements in Karabakh.<ref name="HRW"/> To bolster the ranks of its army, the Armenian government issued a decree, instituting a three-month call-up for men up to age forty-five and resorted to press-gang raids to enlist recruits. Several active-duty Armenian Army soldiers were captured by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name="HRW"/>

Azerbaijan's offensives grew more dire as men as young as 16 with little to no training at all were recruited and sent to take part in ineffective [[human wave]] attacks, tactics once employed by [[Iran]] during the [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War]]. The two offensives that took place in the winter cost Azerbaijan as many as 5,000 men (at the loss of several hundred Armenians).<ref name="Croissant"/> The main Azeri offensive was aimed at recapturing the Khelbajar district, thus threatening the Lachin corridor. The attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing the vital Omar Pass. However, as the Armenian forces reacted, the bloodiest clashes of the war ensued and the Azeri forces were soundly defeated. Several Azeri brigades were isolated when the Armenians recaptured the Omar Pass and were eventually surrounded and destroyed.

While the political foundations changed hands several times in Azerbaijan, most Armenian soldiers in Karabakh claimed that the youths and Azeris themselves, were demoralized and lacked a sense of purpose and commitment to fighting the war.<ref>As one Armenian fighter commented: "The difference is in what you do and what you do it for. You know a few miles back is your family, children, women and old people and therefore you're duty-bound to fight to the death so that those behind you will live."</ref> Russian professor Georgiy I. Mirsky also supported this viewpoint, stating that "Karabakh does not matter to Azerbaijanis as much as it does to Armenians. Probably, this is why young volunteers from Armenia proper have been much more eager to fight and die for Karabakh than the Azerbaijanis have."<ref>{{cite book

===1994 ceasefire===
[[File:Gravestones of Azeri soldiers died in Karabakh war.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The graves of Azerbaijani soldiers located in the city of Baku.]]
After six years of intensive fighting, both sides were ready for a ceasefire. Azerbaijan, after exhausting nearly all its manpower was relying on a ceasefire to be put forth by either the CSCE or by Russia as Armenian commanders stated their forces had an unimpeded path towards [[Baku]]. The borders, however, were confined to Karabakh and the immediate rayons surrounding it. Diplomatic channels increased between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the month of May.<ref name="Croissant"/> The final battles of the conflict took place near [[Shahumyan]] in a series of brief engagements between Armenian and Azeri forces at [[G<U+00FC>l<U+00FC>stan, Goranboy|Gulustan]].

On 16 May, the leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh and Russia met in Moscow to sign a truce that would effectively call for a cessation of hostilities. In Azerbaijan, many welcomed the end of hostilities, while others felt that a contingent of peacekeeping troops to remain temporarily in the area should not have come from Russia. Sporadic fighting continued in some parts of the region but all sides affirmed that they would stay committed to honoring the ceasefire.<ref>{{cite book

==Media coverage==
Armenian-Russian journalist Dmitri Pisarenko who spent a year at the front line and filmed many of the battles later wrote that both Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists were preoccupied with echoing the official stands of their respective governments and that "objectiveness was being sacrificed for ideology." Armenian military commanders were eager to give interviews following Azerbaijani offensives when they were able to criticise the other side for launching heavy artillery attacks that the "small-numbered but proud Armenians" had to fight off. Yet they were reluctant to speak out when Armenian troops seized a village outside Nagorno-Karabakh in order to avoid justifying such acts. Therefore Armenian journalists felt the need to be creative enough to portray the event as "an Armenian counter-offensive" or as "a necessary military operation."<ref>{{ru icon}} "[http://www.library.cjes.ru/online/?a=con&b_id=32&c_id=736 <U+0416><U+0443><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+0441><U+0442><U+044B> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0439><U+043D><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0445><U+0435>: <U+041F><U+0438><U+0441><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E> <U+0414><U+043C><U+0438><U+0442><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> (Journalists in the Karabakh War: Dmitri Pisarenko)]." ''Biblioteka Centra Ekstremalnoy Zhurnalistiki''.</ref>

According to professor Karim H. Karim from [[Carleton University]], foreign journalists previously concerned with emphasizing the Soviet conceding in the [[Cold War]], gradually shifted towards presenting the USSR as a country swamped by a wave of ethnic conflicts, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict being one of them.<ref name="karim">Karim H. Karim. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=8Ucl0kvNaVAC&pg=PA180 Covering the South Caucasus and Bosnian Conflicts: Or How the Jihad Model Appears and Disappears]. In: Abbas Malek, Anandam P. Kavoori. ''The Global Dynamics of News''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2000; p. 180-185</ref> Due to lack of available information about the roots and causes of the conflict, foreign reporters filled the information vacuum with constant references to the religious factor, i.e. the fact that Armenians were predominantly Christian, whereas Azeris were predominantly Muslim; a factor which in fact was virtually irrelevant in the course of the entire conflict.<ref>Chorbajian et al. ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=OUlnYdOHJ3wC&pg=PA9 The Caucasian Knot]'', p. 9.</ref> Readers already aware of rising military Islamism in the Middle East were considered a perfect audience to be informed of a case of "Muslim oppressors victimising a Christian minority," according to Karim.<ref name="karim"/> Religion was unduly stressed more than political, territorial and ethnic factors, with very rare references to democratic and self-determination movements in both countries. It was not until the Khojaly Massacre in late February 1992, when hundreds of civilian Azeris were massacred by Armenian units, that references to religion largely disappeared, as being contrary to the neat journalistic scheme where "Christian Armenians" were shown as victims and "Muslim Azeris" as their victimisers. A study of four largest Canadian newspapers covering the event showed that the journalists tended to present the massacre of Azeris as a secondary issue, as well as to rely on Armenian sources, to give priority to Armenian denials over Azerbaijani "allegations" (which were described as "grossly exaggerated"), to downplay the scale of death, not to publish images of the bodies and mourners, and not to mention the event in editorials and opinion columns.<ref name="karim"/>

Valuable footage of the conflict was provided by a number of journalists from both sides, including Vardan Hovhannisyan, who won the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]]'s prize for best new documentary filmmaker for his ''A Story of People in War and Peace'', [[Chingiz Mustafayev]], who was posthumously awarded the title of [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]], and [[Tsvetana Paskaleva]], noted for her coverage of Operation Ring.

Today, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains one of several frozen conflicts in the [[post-Soviet states]] along with Georgia's breakaway regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] as well as Moldova's troubles with [[Transnistria]]. Karabakh remains under the jurisdiction of the government of the unrecognized but ''[[de facto]]'' independent Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh and maintains its own uniformed military, the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army]].<ref>{{cite book

Since 1995, the co-chairs of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]] has been mediating with the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan to settle for a new solution. Numerous proposals have been made which have primarily been based on both sides making several concessions.

Most autonomy proposals have been rejected, however, by the Armenians, who consider it as a matter that is not negotiable. Likewise, Azerbaijan has also refused to let the matter subside and regularly threatens to resume hostilities.<ref>{{cite news

In the years since the end of the war, a number of organizations have passed resolutions regarding the conflict. On 25 January 2005, for example, [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] adopted a controversial non-binding resolution, [[PACE Resolution 1416|Resolution 1416]], which deplored the "large-scale ethnic expulsion and the creation of mono-ethnic areas" and declared that Armenian forces were occupying Azerbaijan lands.<ref>{{ru icon}} "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/in_depth/newsid_4236000/4236153.stm <U+0420><U+0435><U+0437><U+043E><U+043B><U+044E><U+0446><U+0438><U+044F> <U+041F><U+0410><U+0421><U+0415> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+041A><U+0430><U+0440><U+0430><U+0431><U+0430><U+0445><U+0443>: <U+0447><U+0442><U+043E> <U+0434><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+0448><U+0435>?] (The PACE Resolution on Karabakh: What Next?)."

==Misconduct==

Emerging from the collapse of the Soviet Union as nascent states and due to the near-immediate fighting, it was not until mid-1993 that Armenia and Azerbaijan became signatories of international law agreements, including the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Allegations from all three governments (including Nagorno-Karabakh's) regularly accused the other side of committing atrocities which were at times confirmed by third party media sources or human rights organizations. [[Khojaly Massacre]], for example, was confirmed by both Human Rights Watch and Memorial while what became known as the [[Maraghar Massacre]] was first revealed by the group from the British-based human rights organization [[Christian Solidarity Worldwide|Christian Solidarity International]] headed by Caroline Cox in 1992.<ref name="dewaal"/><ref>Speech given by [[Baron]]ess [[Caroline Cox]] in April 1998.

Accessed 10 February 2007.</ref> Azerbaijan was heavily criticized by HRW for its use of aerial bombing in densely populated civilian areas and both sides were criticized for indiscriminate fire, hostage-taking and the forcible displacement of civilians.<ref name="HRW"/>

The lack of international laws for either side to abide by virtually sanctioned activity in the war to what would be considered [[war crimes]]. Looting and mutilation (body parts such as ears, brought back from the front as treasured war souvenirs) of dead soldiers were commonly reported and even boasted about among soldiers.<ref name="dewaal"/> Another practice that took form, not by soldiers but by regular civilians during the war, was the bartering of prisoners between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Often, when contact was lost between family members and a soldier or a militiaman serving at the front, they took it upon themselves to organize an exchange by personally capturing a soldier from the battle lines and holding them in the confines of their own homes. ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist Yo'av Karny noted this practice was as "old as the people occupying [the] land."<ref>{{cite book

After the war ended, both sides accused their opponents of continuing to hold captives; Azerbaijan claimed Armenia was continuing to hold nearly 5,000 Azerbaijani prisoners while Armenians claimed Azerbaijan was holding 600 people. The non-profit group, Helsinki Initiative 92, investigated two prisons in Shusha and Stepanakert after the war ended, but concluded there were no prisoners-of-war there. A similar investigation arrived at the same conclusion while searching for Armenians allegedly laboring in Azerbaijan's quarries.<ref name="OhanyanVelikhanova">
