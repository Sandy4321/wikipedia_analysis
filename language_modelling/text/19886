'''Sylvanus Griswold Morley''' ([[June 7]], [[1883]] &ndash; [[September 2]] [[1948]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[archaeology|archaeologist]], [[epigraphy|epigrapher]], and [[Mayanist]] scholar who made significant contributions toward the study of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] in the early twentieth century. 

Morley is particularly noted for his extensive excavations of the Maya site of [[Chichen Itza]].  He also published several large compilations and treatises on [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic writing]], and wrote popular accounts on the Maya for a general audience. 

To his contemporaries, he was one of the leading [[Mesoamerica]]n archaeologists of his day.  Although more recent developments in the field have resulted in a re-evaluation of his theories and works, his publications, particularly on [[Maya calendar|calendric]] inscriptions, are still cited.  In his directorship of various projects sponsored by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution]], he oversaw and encouraged many others who later established notable careers in their own right.  His commitment and enthusiasm for Maya studies helped inspire the necessary sponsorship for projects that would ultimately reveal much about ancient Mayan civilization.   

The scope of Morley's [[espionage]] activities only came to light well after his death.  During [[World War I]], his field work in Mexico and Central America was suitable [[cover (intelligence)|cover]] for investigating German submarine bases and anti-American activity.  His espionage was undertaken at the behest of the United States' [[Office of Naval Intelligence]].

==Early life==
Sylvanus G. Morley was born in [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |year=2001<U+2013>5 |encyclopedia=Columbia Encyclopedia |title= Morley, Sylvanus Griswold | publisher=Columbia University Press |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/mo/Morley-S.html |edition=6th edition}}</ref> After first studying [[civil engineering]], he attended [[Harvard University]] as an undergraduate.  His interest in archaeology was sparked by the arrival at the University of a collection of Maya artefacts in 1904.<ref>Most of these artefacts had been spirited out of the country illegally by E. H. Thompson without the consent of the Mexican government; see P<U+00E9>rez de Lara (n.d.)</ref> which had been recovered by [[Edward Herbert Thompson]] from a [[cenote]] near Chichen Itza, at the time a little-explored Maya site. His interest in the Maya may have been stirred even earlier than this; according to his later colleague [[Alfred V. Kidder|A. V. Kidder]], [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s novel ''Heart of the World'' which was based on tales of the "lost cities" of Central America was a particular favorite of the young Morley.<ref>Kidder (1950:94).</ref>

Morley switched to the study of antiquities, and, as part of his research, went to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]], to study the sites and [[architecture]] of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|ancient Pueblo peoples]] (Anasazi).  His contemporaries in this work included the noted artist [[Georgia O'Keeffe]].  Morley made some significant contributions to the definition of a particular "Santa Fe" style of pre-Columbian architecture.<ref name = "Kitchel2005">Kitchel (2005).</ref>

==First expeditions and espionage work==
After graduating from Harvard in 1908, Morley spent the next six years travelling through [[Central America]] and [[Mexico]], engaged in fieldwork with the School of American Archaeology.

This period coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]] and Morley's activities in the region now appear to have been a convenient cover for intelligence gathering and reporting on the movements of [[German Empire|German]] operatives in the region, information which was of keen interest to the U.S. Government.  According to recent investigations,<ref>Harris and Sadler (2003) ''passim.''</ref> Morley was one of several [[Office of Naval Intelligence|ONI]] operatives working in the region under the guise of conducting scholarly research.  Their mission was to seek out evidence of pro-German and anti-American agitation in the Mexico-Central America region and to look for secret German [[U-boat|submarine]] bases (which proved non-existent).  The cover of an archaeologist provided Morley with a ready excuse to travel the countryside armed with photographic equipment.  Several times Morley needed to convince suspicious soldiers of his ''bona fides'', and was almost unmasked on occasion.

Morley produced extensive analyses (he filed over 10,000 pages of reports) on many issues and observations of the region, including detailed coastline charting and identification of political and social attitudes which could be viewed as "threatening" to U.S. interests.  Some of these reports bordered on economic spying, detailing the activities of local competitors and opponents of large U.S. companies present in the region, such as the [[United Fruit Company]] and [[International Harvester]].

As his later work proved, Morley was also a genuine scholar and archaeologist with an abiding interest in the region.  However, his research activities in this period seem to have played a largely secondary role to his espionage duties.  The authors of research into his spying proclaim Morley as "the best secret agent the United States produced during World War I".  A number of archaeologists<ref>Price (2003).</ref> and others, however, express some misgivings about the ethical nature of some of this work and the suspicion it throws to this day upon others engaged in legitimate archaeological fieldwork, particularly those who work or seek to work in "sensitive" government-controlled areas.

Morley did, however, publish his first major work, ''An Introduction to the Study of Maya Hieroglyphs'' (1915), with material drawn from these field trips.

==Carnegie Institution and Chichen Itza proposal==
[[Image:Lightmatter chichen15.jpg|thumb|320px|''[[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|el Castillo]]''; one of the larger structures at the [[Chichen Itza]] site.  The excavation and restoration of this important Maya site were largely due to Morley; two sides of the building shown here were rebuilt under his direction.]]
At the end of the War in 1918, Morley was designated an associate of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]].  He soon came to them with a plan to excavate and restore the large [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chichen Itza]].  Morley's vision was for an ambitious 20-year plan of seasonal investigations and restorative work for the site, which had actually been (perhaps contentiously) purchased by [[Edward Herbert Thompson|Edward H. Thompson]] in 1895 for the sum of 75 [[United States dollar]]s.  To fund the restoration work, Morley proposed a scheme to use contributions drawn from public subscriptions, with a further view to develop the site for tourism.  Indeed, one of the factors which encouraged Morley in selecting this site was its proximity to the major [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]] center of [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n|M<U+00E9>rida]], whose Governor supported the construction of a road to the site.  The Carnegie board looked favorably upon Morley's proposals, and the work soon began in earnest with Morley as the director.

==Fieldwork in Mexico and Central America==
Morley was to devote the next 18 years working in the Maya region, overseeing the seasonal archaeological digs and restoration projects, returning to the United States in the off-season to give a series of lectures on his finds.  Although primarily involved with the work at Chichen Itza, Morley also took on responsibilities which extended Carnegie-sponsored fieldwork to other Maya sites, such as [[Yaxchilan]], [[Coba]], [[Cop<U+00E1>n]], [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]], [[Uxmal]], [[Naranjo]], [[Seibal]] and [[Uaxactun]].  Morley rediscovered the last of these sites (located in the [[El Pet<U+00E9>n|Pet<U+00E9>n]] region of [[Guatemala]], to the north of [[Tikal]]).  Believing that there must be many more as-yet unknown ancient Maya sites in the area, Morley advertised a "bounty" in return for news of such sites to the local ''[[chicle]]ros'', who ranged through the jungles seeking exploitable sources of [[natural gum]]; in due course he was rewarded with the information which led to its rediscovery.  He also bestowed its name, ''uaxactun'', from the [[Mayan languages]], after a [[stela]] inscription he found there which recorded a [[Maya Long Count Calendar]] date in the 8th cycle (i.e., "8-''tuns''"; the name could also literally mean "eight stones", and its pronunciation is also perhaps a pun on "Washington", the home of his sponsoring institute).

During this time, Morley established a reputation for trustworthiness with the local Yucatec [[Maya peoples|Maya]] around M<U+00E9>rida, who were still suffering from the depredations of the [[Caste War of Yucat<U+00E1>n]] against the Mexican government.  Over the years, he was to act almost as their representative in several matters, although he was equally careful not to upset the Mexican and U.S. governments.
 
His directorship over all of the Institute's activities in the Maya region soon ran into difficulty.  In 1926, a dispute arose with the [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|Mexican government]] over the ownership of the plantation in which Chichen Itza was situated; however, the digs and reconstruction effort were able to continue after some interruptions.  Because of cost and schedule overruns as well as criticisms of the quality of some of the research produced, the Carnegie board began to believe that managing multiple projects was not Morley's forte.  In 1929, the overall directorship of the programme was passed to [[Alfred V. Kidder|A. V. Kidder]], and Morley was left to concentrate on Chichen Itza.<ref name = "Villela2000:2">Villela (2000:2).</ref>

Slightly built and not noted for possessing a strong constitution, Morley saw his health deteriorate over the years spent laboring in the Central American jungles under often adverse conditions.  Several times, he was incapacitated by recurring bouts of [[malaria]] and he had to be hospitalised after separately contracting [[colitis]] and then [[amoebic dysentery]] the following year.  During the 1930s, it also became evident that he had developed [[congestive heart failure|cardiac difficulties]], which would plague him for the remainder of his life.  Nevertheless, although he "detested" the jungle conditions, he persevered in his work with evident enthusiasm.

In between overseeing the projects and conducting his own researches, Morley published several treatises on [[Maya hieroglyphics]] and his interpretations on their meaning.  These include a survey of inscriptions at [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] (1920) and a larger study (a massive [[tome]] of over 2,000 pages in five volumes) encompassing many of the sites he had investigated in the [[El Pet<U+00E9>n|Pet<U+00E9>n]] region (1932&ndash;38).

==Influences on other scholars==
Many Mayan scholars and archaeologists had their first research opportunity and employment under Morley's tutelage working on the various Carnegie projects.  Of these, perhaps the two most notable were [[J. Eric S. Thompson]] and [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]]. Thompson shortly became the field's most dominant figure and its uncontested expert.  Together with Morley, he was most responsible for promulgating the view of the ancient Maya as peaceable astronomers, obsessed with [[time]] and [[calendar|calendric]] observations.  This view became the prevailing one for the next several decades. Proskouriakoff also went on to establish a stellar career and a lifelong association with the Carnegie Institution; however, her researches ultimately provided the primary convincing evidence which later disproved much of what had been maintained by Thompson and Morley.

In 1925, a young [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|English]] [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] [[anthropology]] student named [[J. Eric S. Thompson|John Eric Sidney Thompson]] wrote to Morley seeking employment with the Carnegie programme on digs in Central America.  Thompson had studied Morley's 1915 work and from that taught himself [[Maya calendar|Maya calendrics]], which were a particular passion for Morley.  The Carnegie Institution at Morley's urging accordingly hired Thompson, and he soon found himself at work in Chichen Itza, involved with its architectural reconstruction (for which task Thompson had no particular qualifications).  During the 1925&ndash;26 season, Thompson became well-acquainted with Morley, the two of them along with their wives (the newly married Thompson was in fact on his [[honeymoon]]) making several side-trips together.  However, at the end of the 1926 season, Thompson left Carnegie's employ to take up a post offered by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.  This post offered Thompson far greater freedom and diversity for his research.  Thompson and Morley were to remain close and like-minded colleagues in spite of this move.

Towards the end of the Chichen Itza project, Morley came across the drawings of a young artist and draftsperson, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], who as an unpaid excavator had accompanied a 1936&ndash;37 [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]] expedition to the Maya site of [[Piedras Negras (Guatemala)|Piedras Negras]].  The quality of her reconstructive panorama drawings (depicting what the site "might have looked like" when in use) so impressed Morley that he determined to enroll her onto the Carnegie staff.  However, this was in the midst of the [[Great Depression]] and funds for hiring were scarce; it was also not clear whether Morley had the appropriate authority to do so.  After several entreaties, Morley again came up with an innovative funding scheme whereby he devised two campaigns to raise money by subscription to send Proskouriakoff to [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] and the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]].  These were successful, and in 1939, Proskouriakoff transferred onto the Carnegie payroll and was duly dispatched to Cop<U+00E1>n to gather data for reconstructive drawings of that site.<ref name = "Villela2000:2" /> Morley's support of Proskouriakoff was to prove fortuitous to Maya scholarship, as she went on to a lengthy and successful career with the Carnegie Institution and was lauded as one of the foremost Maya scholars of her time.

==Excavations at Chichen Itza==
===Context===
[[image:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A ''[[Chac Mool]]'' statue, first identified by [[Augustus Le Plongeon|le Plongeon]] but later extensively documented by Morley's Chichen Itza excavations.  This type of statue (whose purpose remains unclear, presumed to relate to ritual sacrifice) is also characteristic of [[Toltec]] sites, and thus provided a linkage between [[Chichen Itza]] and Central Mexico.]]
When Morley and his team first arrived in 1924 to commence their excavations, [[Chichen Itza]] was an abandoned and sprawling complex of several large ruined buildings and many smaller ones, most of which lay concealed under mounds of earth and vegetation.  Some areas of the site had previously been surveyed, photographed and documented independently in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by highly-regarded authorities such as  [[Teoberto Maler]], [[Alfred Maudslay]] and [[Eduard Seler]], who although they had meticulously recorded their findings, had not done much in the way of extensive digging.  An earlier attempt at excavation, carried out by the amateur (and somewhat eccentric) enthusiast [[Augustus Le Plongeon]] and his wife, [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon|Alice Dixon]] had been poor and yielded little of value (le Plongeon did however recover and name a type of statue he called a "''[[Chac Mool|chacmool]]''", which would become one of the site's most famous motifs).  Despite the interesting results of these prior investigations, the bulk of the site looked much as it did when it was first visited in 1842 by the explorers [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and [[Frederick Catherwood]], whose detailed travel reports had first re-ignited interest in the general area.

The site itself is located about 75 [[mile]]s (120 [[kilometre|km]]) east of [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n|M<U+00E9>rida]], on the inland plains of north-central [[Yucat<U+00E1>n]].  It had been known to Europeans since the first recorded visits by the 16th century ''[[conquistador]]es''.  During the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat<U+00E1>n|conquest of Yucat<U+00E1>n]], the Spanish attempted to gain a foothold over the fiercely-resisting locals by setting up an encampment in the site in the early 1530s, as a base for their attacks on the inland region.  They were however dissuaded from this enterprise after several months of protracted fighting, and abandoned it (having caused some further, but not extensive, damage).  When they returned to the area in 1542 they finally succeeded in establishing a capital at M<U+00E9>rida, which they built upon another (still-inhabited) Maya city called ''T'ho'' (or ''Tiho'').

Chichen Itza had evidently been functionally abandoned long before the Spanish first came, although the local [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Yucatec [[Maya people|Maya]] still lived in settlements nearby, and even within its former boundaries (but in recently-built wooden huts, not the stone buildings themselves). The name "Chichen Itza" is known from the earliest recorded Spanish accounts <U+2014>such as [[Diego de Landa]]'s<U+2014> of these local inhabitants, for whom the site had long been a place of pilgrimage and ceremony.  The name (''chich'en itza'' in modern Yukatek orthography) means roughly "mouth of the well of the [[Itza]]", the "well" being the nearby sacred ''[[cenote]]'' (water-filled sinkhole) and "Itza" being the name of the people who were reputed to be its former inhabitants.  Over the next three centuries after the Conquest, the site remained relatively undisturbed until the arrival of Stephens and Catherwood, although several plantations were established nearby.

At the time its full extent was not at all clear, but today it is recognised as one of the largest Maya sites in the Yucat<U+00E1>n region.  How long ago the site had been functionally abandoned (not including the ongoing presence of local Maya farmers) was not immediately apparent, although it appeared to have been recently, in comparison with the seemingly older abandoned sites of the central and southern Maya region.

===Major finds===
[[Image:Templo de los Guerreros-x768.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Temple of the Warriors", excavated by Morley's team. The rows of the "Thousand Columns" can be seen in its foreground, and extending off to the right.]]
In 1924, armed with a renewable ten-year digging concession from the Mexican government, Morley, his field director [[Earl Morris|Earl H. Morris]], artists [[Ann Axtel Morris]] and [[Jean Charlot]], and several others began their first explorations. They selected an area within what appeared to be the central plaza of the site, where the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of some [[column]]s lay exposed.<ref>Charlot's biography (McVicker 1994).</ref> Much to their surprise they uncovered row upon row of free-standing columns <U+2014> surprising since such columns hardly ever figured in Classic [[Maya architecture]]. This complex (now called the "Complex of a Thousand Columns", although the columns number fewer than one thousand), un-Maya-like in both execution and arrangement, added confirmation to earlier speculations that Chichen Itza was something of an enigma. This arrangement had much more in common with the architectural styles of civilizations in central Mexico (more than a thousand kilometres away) than that of the Classic or Pre-Classic Maya. In particular, this complex and some others which were gradually revealed appeared to have much in common with structures built at [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], believed to be the capital of the [[Toltec]]s and which was located about 100 km north of present-day [[Mexico City]].

Over the next few seasons, the team expanded their digs, recovering other anomalous structures from the earthen mounds, such as the Temple of the Jaguar and the Temple of the Warriors. In 1927 they discovered an older structure underneath this latter, which they called the "Temple of the Chacmool" after a further example found of this distinctive statuary. These structures had [[fresco]]es which again exhibited a non-Maya style, or at least a hybrid of Maya and non-Maya. They also worked on the reconstruction of ''el Caracol'', a unique circular building believed (and later confirmed) to be an [[observatory]]. A separate archaeological dig, this one under the Mexican government, had also commenced working the site; the two projects divided the areas to excavate, continuing side-by-side for several years, in a somewhat guarded but nonetheless cordial fashion.

While Morris oversaw day-to-day operations, and Charlot sketched the murals, Morley occupied himself with copying all the inscriptions he could find, particularly the date portions. Since most of these inscription dates at the site were recorded in an abbreviated form known as the "Short Count", which only identified an event within a span of about 260 years, it was difficult to pin down in which particular span an event referred to in the inscriptions occurred. Towards the end of the project Morley's work on these was to be superseded somewhat by a more-comprehensive analysis made by [[Hermann Beyer]] in 1937. In this work, Beyer would note:

<blockquote>I frequently have differed with the opinions of Dr.<ref>Almost universally addressed as "Doctor", Morley (like many of his contemporaries) did not actually hold a postgraduate degree (Coe 1992:127).</ref> Sylvanus G. Morley. This is easily explained by the fact that he is one of the few archaeologists who have studied the hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza. While I agree with his results on the inscriptions of the Old Empire cities which contain many dates and time periods, I find that his method of dealing solely with calendrical matter fails at Chichen Itza, since there are but few hieroglyphs of that nature.<ref>Beyer (1937), p. 3 of Preface (as reproduced online at Mesoweb).</ref></blockquote>

The later years of the project would increasingly concentrate on completing the restorative work on the principal structures, for Morley always had an eye on the dual purpose of the project: to research, but also rebuild to generate the promised revenue from tourism.

===Result summary===
[[Image:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Columnar statues in the form known as "Atlantids", representing [[Toltec]] warriors. The examples shown here are from the Toltec site of [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula (Tollan)]], north of [[Mexico City]]; similar examples and styles found at Chichen Itza by Morley provided further evidence of Maya cultural exchange with central Mexico.]]
The net research result of their excavations revealed Chichen Itza to be an unusual mixture of building styles: not only was there a wide variety of Maya styles such as [[Puuc]], [[Rio Bec]] and [[Chenes]], but a significant presence of Mexican influences such as [[El Taj<U+00ED>n]], but more particularly Toltec. The evidence indicated that the site had been inhabited since at least the mid-Classic, but that a particular florescence had occurred in the Post-Classic, when the site was apparently a major power. From the combined results of their work, that of others, and some documented tales of contact-era Maya peoples, a view was formed that Chichen Itza had actually been invaded and conquered sometime in the tenth century by Toltec warriors from the far west, who maintained their hold over the local Maya for another century or so, only in turn to be replaced by a later mixed Maya-Mexica group known as the [[Itza]]. Later evidence suggested that the actual year of this invasion was 987, and identified its leader with a legendary Toltec ruler called [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl]] after the Mesoamerican deity [[Quetzalcoatl]] (''[[Kulkulcan|K'ulk'ulkan]]'' in Yucatec).

Morley was in general opposed to ideas that other external groups had influenced the Maya, but in this case, since the conquest occurred in the "degenerate" Post-Classic phase he found it acceptable. This view of the Toltec invasion of Yucat<U+00E1>n became the one maintained by the majority of Mayanists.  However, recent research from the mid-1990s onwards has now questioned this orthodoxy, to the point where many now hold an actual invasion did not take place, but the similarities in style are largely due to [[cultural diffusion]] and trade, and that in fact there is evidence that the diffusion in this period flowed in both directions.<ref name = "VossKremer2000">Voss and Kremer (2000).</ref>

The chronology of Chichen Itza continues to be a source of debate, and the hoped-for answers to the mystery of the Classic Maya decline elusive (wholesale "Mexicanisation" by invading forces ruled out by the lack of these indicators in the central and southern sites). However, the Carnegie excavations did add significantly to the corpus of available information, and are notable for their scope alone, if not for fine details and quality of research. The site's reconstruction by Carnegie has proved to be a lasting one, and the site today is among the most visited of pre-Columbian ruins in all of Central America and Mexico, with in excess of a million visitors per year.

==Project completion and final years==
After almost twenty years, Carnegie's Chichen Itza project wound to a close in 1940, its restorative and investigative work complete and its objectives substantially met. Morley returned to the United States to take up directorships in the School of American Research and the Museum of New Mexico. He also started work on a large-scale work on ancient Maya society, which he completed and published in 1946. This was to be one of his more successful works (outside of his popular writings in magazines), and has been posthumously revised and reprinted several times.

However, Morley would not again return to the region in which he had spent so much time and with whose investigations he had become almost synonymous; Sylvanus Morley died in 1948, aged 65, two years after this last major publication.

==Theories and retrospective assessment==

This illustrates the text appearing on a [[lintel]] in the [[Chichen Itza]] building commonly known as the "Temple of the Initial Series", as it is the only inscription for the site known to show a [[Maya Long Count Calendar]] date. The date shown here (starting row 2, ending at A5) is 10.2.9.1.9 9 Muluk 7 Sak (equivalent to [[July 30]] [[878]] CE).<ref name = "VossKremer2000" />]]
In his day, Sylvanus Morley was widely regarded as one of the leading figures in Maya scholarship, in authority perhaps second only to Eric Thompson, whose views he mostly shared. From the late 1920s through to perhaps the mid-1970s, the reconstruction of ancient Maya society and history pieced together by Morley, Thompson and others constituted the "standard" interpretation against which competing views had to be measured. However, major advances made in the [[decipherment]] of [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic writing]] and refinements in archaeological data which have been made since that time have now called into question much of this former "standard" interpretation, overturning key elements and significantly revising the Maya historical account.  As far as Morley's own research is concerned, its reputation for soundness and quality has been downgraded somewhat in the light of recent reappraisals;<ref>Houston (1989).</ref><ref name = "Coe1992">Coe (1992).</ref> yet he is still regarded as an important contributor to the field.

===Views on ancient Maya society===
Morley maintained that ancient Maya society was essentially a united [[theocracy]], and one which was almost exclusively devoted to [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations and mystically noting (even "worshipping") the passage of [[time]].  These ideas (which Thompson's later work would develop to its fullest extent) are now extensively modified, and although astronomical and calendric observations were clearly important to the Maya, the people themselves are now seen in more historical, realistic terms&mdash;concerned also with dynastic succession, political conquests, and the lives and achievements of actual personages.

He also believed that the southern centers such as [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] and [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]] had been united in the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classical period]] under what he termed the "Old Empire".  This empire mysteriously collapsed, but the remnants later migrated to the northern sites (such as Chichen Itza) to form a "New Empire".  It is now generally accepted that at no time was the Maya region united under a single [[polity]], but rather that individual "city-states" maintained a somewhat independent existence, albeit one with its fluctuating conquests and local subservience to more dominant centers.  In support of his view, Morley devised a 4-tier classification system of relative importance, which he ascribed to all of the then-known main Maya sites (about 116); many more sites are now known, and his classification system is now seen as an arbitrary one, contradicted in places by the sites' texts which can now be (substantially) read.<ref>Coe (1992:126<U+2013>129).</ref>

Other ideas Morley put forward include the proposal that the ancient Maya were the first in [[Mesoamerica]] to [[domestication|domesticate]] [[maize]] (''Zea mays'' ssp. ''mays''), with the wild variety known as ''[[teosinte]]'' being its [[progenitor]].  Recent [[genetics|genetic]] studies have shown Morley to be largely correct in this, although the beginnings of its domestication ([[10th millennium BC|12,000]] to [[5th millennium BC|7,500]] years ago) pre-dates the establishment of anything resembling Maya society.  In general, Morley held that the ancient Maya had been the pre-eminent [[civilization]] of Mesoamerica, from which other cultures had drawn their influences.  It is now accepted that other societies (such as the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Olmec]]) preceded that of the Maya and the influences&mdash;such as development of [[writing system|writing]] and the [[Mesoamerican calendars]]&mdash;were rather the other way around; even in the later stages of Maya history, their region came under significant influences drawn from central Mexico, such as the [[Toltec]] "invasion". However, the Maya did also exert a widespread influence over neighboring contemporary cultures, one which was significant and not to be overlooked.

===Maya writing===
In common with most other Maya scholars, Morley was particularly interested in the mysterious nature of the [[Maya script]].  The essentials of the calendric notation and astronomical data had been worked out by the early twentieth century, and by the 1930s [[John E. Teeple]] had solved (with Morley's encouragement) the glyphs known as the "Supplementary Series", proving that these referred to the [[lunar cycle]] and could be used to predict [[lunar eclipse]]s. However, the bulk of the texts and inscriptions still defied all attempts at decipherment, despite much concerted effort. It was Morley's view, and one that found wide support, that these undeciphered portions would contain only more of the same astronomical, calendric and perhaps religious information, not actual historical data.  He wrote in 1940, "time, in its various manifestations, the accurate record of its principal phenomena, constitutes the majority of Maya writing."<ref>Morley (1940:144<U+2013>149).</ref><ref name = "Coe1992:143">Coe (1992:143).</ref>
He also wrote that he doubted that any [[toponym]] would be found in the texts. He supposed that the Maya writing system was one based upon [[ideogram|ideographic]] or [[pictogram|pictographic]] principles, without any [[phonetics|phonetic]] components. That is to say, each [[glyph]] represented whole ideas and concepts, and how the symbols were depicted bore no relation to the [[phoneme|language sounds]] as spoken by the scribes who had written them.

The convincing evidence which was to overturn this view became known only after Morley's death, starting with [[Yuri Knorosov]]'s work in the 1950s. Over the next decades other Mayanists such as Proskouriakoff, [[Michael D. Coe]], and [[David H. Kelley]] would further expand upon this phonetic line of enquiry, which ran counter to the accepted view but would prove to be ever more fruitful as their work continued. By the mid-1970s, it had become increasingly clear to most that the Maya [[writing system]] was a [[logogram|logosyllabic]] one, a mixture of logograms and phonetic components that included a fully functional [[syllabary]].<ref name = "Coe1992" /><ref name = "MayaScript">[[Maya script]].</ref>

These realizations led to the successful [[decipherment]] of many of the texts which had been impenetrable (and almost "dismissed") by Morley and the "old school". In retrospect, these breakthroughs may have been realized earlier had it not been for Morley's, and later Eric Thompson's, almost "on principle" position against the phonetic approach. Consequently, most of Morley's attempts to advance understanding of the Maya script have been superseded.

Morley's particular passion was the study of the [[Maya calendar]] and its related inscriptions, and in this respect, he made useful expositions that have withstood later scrutiny.  His talent was not so much to make innovations, but rather to publicise and explain the workings of the various systems. He was particularly proficient at recovering calendar dates from well-worn and weathered inscriptions, owing to his great familiarity with the various glyphic styles of the ''[[Tzolkin|tzolk'in]]'', ''[[Haab|haab']]'' and [[Maya Long Count Calendar|Long Count]] elements. Yet in his focus on calendric details, he would often overlook or even neglect the documentation of other non-calendric aspects of the Maya script; the comprehensiveness of some of his publications suffered much as a result. Some leading figures from a later generation of Mayanists would come to regard his publications as being inferior in detail and scope to that of  his predecessors, such as [[Teoberto Maler]] and [[Alfred Maudslay]] &mdash; poorer quality reproductions, omitted texts, sometimes inaccurate drawings.<ref>Coe (1992:127<U+2013>129).</ref>

===Archaeology===
As a director of archaeological excavation projects, Sylvanus Morley was well regarded and liked by his colleagues and his Carnegie board employers, his later movement to "lighter duties" notwithstanding. The reconstructions of Chichen Itza and other sites were widely admired; but in terms of the research output and the resulting documentation produced, the legacy of these projects did not quite amount to what might have been expected to come from such a lengthy investigation. For some later Maya researchers, "<U+2026>in spite of seventeen years of research at Chich<U+00E9>n Itz<U+00E1> by Carnegie, this world-famous city yet remains an archaeological enigma";<ref>Coe (1992:128).</ref> it is comparatively little-understood given the amount of work which had gone into it under Morley's direction. Coe also comments that many talented people such as Thompson would spend more time in restoring the site for later tourism than in actual research. Thompson himself would later remark in reference to his time working for Carnegie:
"<U+2026>in my memory it seems that I personally shifted every blessed stone."<ref>Coe (1992:128), from Thompson (1963:30).</ref>

===Summation===
Despite the later reassessments that were to somewhat dull the shine of his achievements, Sylvanus Morley remains a notable and respected figure in Maya scholarship.  His publications are now generally superseded, except for his calendrical compilations.  His [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] work, which was his personal abiding interest ("bringing home the epigraphic bacon" was a favorite quote of his), is likewise generally outdated, although it was widely supported for several decades after his death.  Perhaps the contributions that today remain the most relevant arise from his instigation of the Carnegie research programmes, his enthusiasm and support shown to other scholars, and the undeniable successes in the restorative efforts that have made the Maya sites justly famous.  He had particular talents in communicating his fascination for the subject to a wider audience, and in his lifetime became quite widely known as perhaps ''the'' quintessential model of an early 20th-century Central American scholar and explorer, complete with his ever-present [[pith helmet]].  Some have even speculated<ref>See for example Kitchel (2005)</ref> that his life and exploits may have provided some of the inspiration for the character of [[Indiana Jones]] in the [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] films; the Carnegie Institute itself mentions that it might also have been Morley's field director at Chichen Itza, Earl Morris.<ref name = "Carnegie">[http://carnegieinstitution.org/news_011210.html  Carnegie Celebrates 100 Years of Scientific Breakthroughs], Carnegie Institution.</ref>  

Sylvanus Morley was also to be remembered as a spokesman and representative of the [[Maya peoples]], among whom he spent so much of his time, and who otherwise lacked the means to directly address some of their concerns with the wider public.

==Major works==
Morley's publications include:
*1915 <U+2013> ''An Introduction to the Study of Maya Hieroglyphs''
*1920 <U+2013> ''The Inscriptions of Cop<U+00E1>n''
*1938 <U+2013> ''The Inscriptions of Pet<U+00E9>n'' (5 vols.)
*1946 <U+2013> ''The Ancient Maya'' (revised 3rd ed. issued in 1956 by G. W. Brainerd)

In addition to his scholarly work, Morley thought it important to share his enthusiasm for the ancient Maya with the public.  He wrote a popular series of articles about the Maya and various Maya sites in the ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]''.  Several later archaeologists would recall that their youthful exposure to these articles, "vividly illustrated with a color rendition of a purported virgin in filmy ''[[huipil]]'' [a type of clothing] being hurled into the Sacred Cenote", had drawn them into the field in the first place.<ref>Coe (1992:126).</ref>

==The "other" Sylvanus G. Morley==
Confusingly, and remarkably, there were actually two Sylvanus Griswold Morleys whose careers were contemporaneous. This second Sylvanus G. Morley was in fact the older maternal cousin to the first, born [[February 23]] [[1878]], in [[Baldwinville, Massachusetts|Baldwinville]], [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]], [[Massachusetts]]. This latter was originally baptised Sylvanus Griswold Small ("Sylvanus Griswold" being a family "heirloom" name), but changed his surname from Small to Morley in his early twenties when his father did likewise.  As a result, many biographical references confuse details of the two, such as interchanging their birthplaces.

Sylvanus G. (Small) Morley preceded Sylvanus the archaeologist into Harvard, and he was later to establish a career as a Professor of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. In his autobiography, the Spanish professor noted the effect of this name change and subsequent confusion:
{{blockquote|However, the person with the most right to complain was my cousin Sylvanus Griswold Morley, the celebrated archaeologist. The move made us homonyms, and gave rise to endless confusion. Look in a Who's Who in America and you will learn the facts.  Look in a library catalog, and you will be lucky to learn anything but errors. Sylvanus, a most good-natured soul, never protested. He was an undergraduate at Harvard while I was in the Grad. School. I sometimes received his Univ. bills, and less often, [[Love letter|billets doux]] from his lights of love. I think he has none of mine.<ref>{{cite web|author=Morley, Thomas (Ed.) |year=1997 |title=One Life: A Non-Transcendental Autobiography |work=Autobiographical Writings of Sylvanus Griswold (Small) Morley |url= http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/~rgf/SGM3.html |accessdate = 2005-10-30}}</ref>}}
Sylvanus G. (Small) Morley died in 1970; his son Thomas published his autobiographical notes posthumously.
