'''Aschaffenburg''' ({{IPA-de|a<U+02C8><U+0283>af<U+0259>nb<U+028A><U+0250><U+032F>k}}, locally {{IPA|[<U+02C8>a<U+0292><U+0259>b<U+025B><U+02D0><U+0283>]}}) is a city in northwest [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. The town of Aschaffenburg is not considered part of the [[Aschaffenburg (district)|district of Aschaffenburg]], but is the administrative seat. 

Aschaffenburg belonged to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]] for more than 800 years. The city is located at the westernmost border of Lower Franconia and separated from the central and eastern part of the administrative district by the Spessart hills, whereas it opens towards the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main plain]] in the west and north-west. Therefore, the inhabitants speak neither Bavarian nor East Franconian but rather a local version of [[Rhine Franconian]].

==Geography==
===Geographic location===
The town is located on both sides of the [[River Main]] in the southwest part of [[Germany]], {{convert|41|km|mi|sp=us}} southeast of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. The second river is the small [[Aschaff]] which flows in the western part of the town into the River Main. The region is called ''Bayerischer Untermain'' or Bavarian Lower Main.

===Climate===
Continental, typically with warm, dry summers and cold, damp winters. Aschaffenburg usually receives less snowfall during the winter than the nearby [[Spessart]].

===Municipal districts===
[[File:<U+00D6>Denkmal2.jpg|thumb|Austrian memorial in the <U+00D6>sterreicher Kolonie district]]

Aschaffenburg counts 10 districts:

* Damm
* Gailbach
* Leider
* Nilkheim
* Obernau
* Obernauer Kolonie
* <U+00D6>sterreicher Kolonie (Austrian Colony)
* Schweinheim
* Stadtmitte (city center)
* Strietwald

Nilkheim and Leider are the only districts located on the left bank of the river [[Main (river)|Main]].

===Neighbouring communities===
The following municipalities border Aschaffenburg:

[[Johannesberg]], [[Glattbach]], [[Goldbach]], [[Haibach]], [[Bessenbach]], [[Sulzbach am Main]], [[Niedernberg]], [[Gro<U+00DF>ostheim]], [[Stockstadt am Main]] and [[Mainaschaff]].

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The name ''Aschaffenburg'' (''Ascaffaburc, Ascapha'' or ''Ascaphaburg'' in the Middle Ages) originally meant "castle at the ash tree river" deriving from the river ''Aschaff'' that runs through parts of the town.

=== Brief history ===

The earliest remains of settlements in the area of Aschaffenburg date from the [[Stone Age]]. Aschaffenburg was originally a settlement of the [[Alamanni]]. [[Roman legion]]s were stationed here, and on the ruins of their ''castra'' the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[mayor of the palace|mayors of the palace]] built a castle. In the [[Middle Ages]] the town was known as ''Ascaffaburc'', ''Ascapha'' or ''Ascaphaburg''. [[Saint Boniface]] erected a chapel to [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]] and founded a [[Benedictine]] monastery here. A stone bridge over the Main was built by Archbishop Willigis in 989. Adalbert increased the importance the town in various ways about 1122. In 1292 a synod was held here, and in 1474 an [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]], preliminary to that of [[Vienna]], approved a concordat (sometimes called the ''Aschaffenburg Concordat'').

The town suffered greatly during the [[Thirty Years' War]], being held in turn by the various belligerents. It formed part of the electorate of the [[Archbishop of Mainz]], and in 1803 was made over to the chancellor, Archbishop [[Charles of Dalberg]] as the [[Principality of Aschaffenburg]]. 

Site of the [[Royal Bavarian Central Forest Academy]] (Koniglich Bayerischen Central Forstlehranstalt), established in 1807, "made famous by the researches of Professor Dr [[Ernst Ebermayer]]." The Academy was "dissolved in 1832, but re-organized under the Ministry of Finance in 1874"; and, as "of 30th March, 1874, united to the [[University of Munich]]."<ref>[http://www21.us.archive.org/stream/technicalinstruc00unit/technicalinstruc00unit_djvu.txt Barnard, Henry. 1870. "Technical instruction. Special report of the Commissioner of Education." United States House of Representatives, January 19.] Accessed: May 7, 2012.</ref>

In 1810 it was merged into the new [[Grand Duchy of Frankfurt]], although Dalberg retained Aschaffenburg as his residence. In 1814 the city was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] by an Austrian-Bavarian treaty. In 1817 it was included within Bavarian [[Lower Franconia]]. From 1842<U+2013>1849, King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] built a country house to the west of town. It was named ''Pompejanum'' after its model, the house of [[Castor and Polydeuces|Castor and Pollux]] at [[Pompeii]].

In 1866 the [[Prussian Army]] inflicted a severe defeat on the [[Austrian Empire|Austrians]] in the neighbourhood during the [[Austro-Prussian War]].

In [[World War II]], Aschaffenburg was heavily damaged by Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|area bombing]], including [[Schloss Johannisburg]] which was completely restored several years later. The Germans chose to defend Aschaffenburg with particular steadfastness, which resulted in the Battle of Aschaffenburg fought 28 March - 3 April 1945. The US [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] was forced to take the fortified city against stiff German resistance in a series of frontal assaults that involved house-to-house fighting and brutal close combat. The resulting horrific urban destruction was widespread and quite severe, as cannon fire was used point-blank to blast through structures.<ref>Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books, p. 134-135</ref>

In the decades following the war, Aschaffenburg and the surrounding region experienced robust economic prosperity, partially due to its close proximity to [[Frankfurt am Main]].

According to an online 2002 survey in ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine, [Stern 14/2002], 82 percent of residents living in the ''Bayerischer Untermain'' region where Aschaffenburg is located were satisfied with the place where they lived. This was the highest level recorded in the survey making this region the #1 place to live in Germany, based on several factors including employment opportunities in the region, educational facilities, public services, transportation, recreational options, shopping, cultural facilities/events, climate, etc.

Another survey taken in 2006 by McKinsey, ''Stern'' magazine, [[ZDF]], and web.de showed that Aschaffenburg has one of the highest ratings for quality of life in Germany.

===US military presence (1945<U+2013>2007)===

Aschaffenburg was the location of several United States Army installations throughout the [[Cold War]]. The [[US Army]] occupied facilities formerly used and controlled by the [[Wehrmacht]]. The installation sites were known as Ready Kaserne, Smith Kaserne, Graves Kaserne, Fiori Kaserne, and Jaeger Kaserne, housing armour, infantry, engineer, maintenance and artillery elements of the US Army 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division and various VII Corps elements including the 9th Engineer Battalion. Much of the US Army presence in Aschaffenburg ended in 1992 with the ending of the Cold War. The last buildings, which were primarily used for housing, were handed back to the local government in 2007.
