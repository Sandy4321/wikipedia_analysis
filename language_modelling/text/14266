"'''Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)'''" is a [[Single (music)|single]] from former [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] singer [[Holly Johnson]].

The song was written by [[Holly Johnson]] (lyrics and music) and [[Nick Bagnall]] (music).

==Background==
Released as the first single since Johnson discovered he was [[HIV]]-positive, which had triggered a temporary withdrawal from music, Johnson began to write songs again with bass player Nick Bagnall. The song, released from the writing sessions with Bagnall, was released by Johnson as a gift to the world, particularly the gay community for supporting Johnson's career over the previous ten years.<ref>http://www.hollyjohnson.com/dispatch/?page_id=43</ref>

The single peaked at #97 in the UK<ref>http://zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_J.HTM</ref> and according to Johnson's official website, the single went to number-one in [[Israel]].<ref>http://www.hollyjohnson.com/dispatch/?page_id=43</ref> 

Johnson would later perform the song in front of 150,000 people at the annual Gay Pride Festival - the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref>http://www.hollyjohnson.com/dispatch/?page_id=43</ref>

The single was later re-recorded for Johnson's 1999 album ''[[Soulstream (Holly Johnson album)|Soulstream]]'', where it was named "Legendary Children (2000)".<ref>http://www.discogs.com/Holly-Johnson-Soulstream/master/385667</ref>

In a January 1994 issue of The Advocate magazine, the song was mentioned in an article based on homosexual-themed music, stating ''"Holly Johnson, the former voice of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, enumerated gay heroes on his single "Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)."''<ref>http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5WMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA791&lpg=PA791&dq=legendary+children+holly+johnson&source=bl&ots=yav11xI1JZ&sig=immEeFZSLkLLcFW4bxAKXR8ftqA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=miJwUIzpDMHJ0AW454HgCg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=legendary%20children%20holly%20johnson&f=false</ref>

In an early October 1994 edition of the Los Angeles Times, the issue spoke of the song's lyrical references, stating ''"The names range from Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci to more recent pop heroes including the late Andy Warhol and Boy George, as well as Holly Johnson himself. There's been some confusion over one name: Michael Mouse, which is not a reference to Disney's Mickey but to a gay character from author Armistead Maupin's "Tales of the City" stories."''<ref>http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/59634149.html?dids=59634149:59634149&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+02%2C+1994&author=Dave+Jennings%2C+from+London&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=POP+EYE&pqatl=google</ref>

==Promotion==
The single was promoted by a music video, which featured various homosexual characters appearing in a catwalk fashion, where they all gather in a boxing ring. Johnson, who is mostly seen performing the song in front of a black backdrop, uses a heavy amount of make-up for his appearance in the video, whilst wearing a purple jacket and a holding a cane.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upCFfEkTXF8</ref>

Since appearing officially on YouTube in August 2010, the video has gained approximately 8,000 views.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upCFfEkTXF8</ref>

Another form of promotion was the song's live performance at the annual Gay Pride Festival in London during 1994, where Johnson also performed the two Frankie Goes to Hollywood hit tracks "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" and "[[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)|The Power of Love]]".<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqXAWWGENWg</ref>

==Critical reception==
Jon O'Brien of Allmusic spoke of the ''Soulstream'' re-recorded version of the song in a review of the ''Soulstream'' album, stating ''"The William Orbit-esque production of the empowering opener "Lady Luck," and the subtle trip-hop-tinged title track show that Johnson still occasionally had his finger on the pulse. But unnecessary reworkings of 1984 chart-topper "The Power of Love" and the 1994 flop, gay anthem "Legendary Children (All of Them Queer)," only highlight the creative rut he appeared to be stuck in."''<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/soulstream-mw0000948512</ref>
