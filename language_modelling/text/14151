"'''Custard Pie'''" is the first track on [[England|English]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Led Zeppelin]]'s sixth album, ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'', released in [[1975 in music|1975]]. The lyrics to the riff-heavy song pays homage to the blues songs of the [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] era; specifically "Drop Down Mama" by [[Sleepy John Estes]], "Shake 'Em On Down" by [[Bukka White]], "I Want Some Of Your Pie" by [[Blind Boy Fuller]] and "Custard Pie Blues" by [[Brownie McGhee]].<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref>

The song contains somewhat difficult-to-comprehend lyrics, but, like several other songs on the album, they are full of sexual innuendo. In this case, "Custard Pie" refers to a woman's sexual organs and the song is rife with references to oral sex: ''"Your custard pie, yeah, sweet and nice / When you cut it mama, save me a slice"'', as well as ''"chewin' a piece of your custard pie"''.

"Custard Pie" contains a [[wah-wah]] solo by guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], which was played through an ARP synthesizer.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> It also features an electric [[clavinet]] played by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and a mouth harp by vocalist [[Robert Plant]].<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> Some observers have pointed out that it displays some similarities in sound to "[[Whole Lotta Love]]" from ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', which was itself heavily influenced by the blues song "You Need Love" written by [[Willie Dixon]].

Despite being rehearsed for Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1975|1975 US Tour]], this track was never completely played live at [[Led Zeppelin concerts]].<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> However, on 21 May 1977 in Houston, Texas, Robert and Jimmy did very briefly perform [[Custard Pie]] during the acoustic set.

Robert Plant incorporated a chorus of the song on the end of the live version of his solo song, "Tall Cool One". Page also produced his own live version on his ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' tour.  In 1999, Page again performed the song, this time whilst on his tour with [[The Black Crowes]].  A version of "Custard Pie" performed by Page and The Black Crowes can be found on the album ''[[Live at the Greek]]''.

[[Helmet (band)|Helmet]] with [[David Yow]] recorded a version of "Custard Pie" for the [[1995]] Led Zeppelin [[tribute album]] ''[[Encomium (album)|Encomium]]''.

This song is also the basis of [[Dread Zeppelin]]'s "[[Viva Las Vegas (song)|Viva Las Vegas]]".
