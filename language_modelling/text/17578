'''''The Only Solution''''' is the fifth album by [[Cold 187um]] and his first album for [[Psychopathic Records]]. Released on October 22, 2012, it is a [[concept album]], focusing on the story of a hired killer, the "Psychopathic Assassin", as he performs his job and pursues revenge against his uncle, Black Swan, who had murdered the Assasin's father.

== Background ==

In 2009, Cold 187um was invited to perform at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], but because of his mother's cancer, he declined the offer.<ref name=JuggaloNews/> However, he later agreed to develop a project with [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s [[Joseph Bruce|Violent J]]. After releasing ''Only God Can Judge Me'' on another label, Violent J proposed that [[Psychopathic Records]] release their project, and Cold 187um agreed to tour with Insane Clown Posse and [[Twiztid]] to promote the project.<ref name=JuggaloNews/> 

Psychopathic wanted to develop an album that would combine the talents of Cold 187um and Psychopathic in a way that would appeal to [[Juggalo]]s, the label's fanbase, and establish the rapper to that audience, as he was well known for his efforts in [[gangsta rap]], but not previously established to Juggalos.<ref name=Metro>http://blogs.metrotimes.com/index.php/2012/10/city-slang-psychopathic-prepare-to-unleash-cold-187um/</ref> 

Additionally, Cold 187um felt that in order to sign with Psychopathic, he had to create material that would be different from what he produced for his own label, West World Records.<ref name=JuggaloNews>http://juggalonews.com/home/index.php/content/music/interviews/1083-cold-187um-interview</ref> During the tour, Cold 187um and [[Joseph Bruce|Violent J]] created the character of a hired killer, and developed the concept of the album as a long-form story.<ref name=JuggaloNews/> After the tour, it was officially announced that Cold 187um had signed with Psychopathic.<ref name=Metro/>

== Concept and storyline ==

''The Only Solution'' is a [[concept album]] which tells the story of a assassin as he develops from a young boy into a hired killer,<ref name=faygoluvers/> the "Psychopathic Assassin", who is hired by "The Company" whenever someone "needs to be taken care of".<ref name=Fontana>http://www.ingroovesfontana.com/new-releases/cd-vinyl/10-2-&-10-9-INgF-NR-Book.pdf</ref> It is prepackaged with a [[comic book]] that corresponds with the album's story.<ref name=faygoluvers/><ref name=Fontana/> Within the storyline, the album's character is identified as "Cold 187um"<ref name=AnOffer>"An Offer He Can't Refuse", ''The Only Solution''.</ref> and "Hutch".<ref name=Interrogation>"Interrogation", ''The Only Solution''.</ref> 

The story begins with Hutch being brought into the business by his father and uncle, who brought Hutch along during "hits" because the targets are more vulnerable when a child is present.<ref name=Born2Kill>"Born 2 Kill", ''The Only Solution''.</ref> Hutch commits his first assassination at the age of 10.<ref name=Born2Kill/><ref name=ComicBook1>''The Only Solution'' comic book, pages 1-3.</ref> At the height of their success, Hutch's uncle, Black Swan, murders his brother out of greed, and Hutch swears to avenge his father by seeking revenge against Black Swan.<ref name=Born2Kill/><ref name=ComicBook1/>

The rest of the album's storyline focuses on Cold 187um in the present day as he performs assassinations of several people, including Father Duckets, a greedy, corrupt preacher,<ref>"Job Well Done", ''The Only Solution''.</ref> Willie Brosco, who stole money from Cold 187um's employers,<ref name=AnOffer/> Larry Longhorn, a corrupt judge who proclaims excessive sentences to the plaintiffs that face him,<ref>"Judgement Day", ''The Only Solution''</ref> three despicable criminal brothers,<ref>"3 Brothers", ''The Only Solution''</ref> and the corrupt Senator Jones,<ref>"Capitol Hill", ''The Only Solution''</ref> as well as pursuing Black Swan and seeking revenge for his father.<ref>"Swan Song", ''The Only Solution''</ref><ref>"Swan Sighting", ''The Only Solution''</ref> The album's storyline concludes with the Psychopathic Assassin's son stating that he is happy as long he is alive and free,<ref name=ComicBook36>''The Only Solution'' comic book, pages 36-37.</ref><ref>"Alive & Free", ''The Only Solution''</ref> a sharp contrast from the Assassin's view that the world is "dangerous" and "full of snakes".<ref name=ComicBook36/>

== Production ==

While developing the album, Cold 187um hand selected instrumentals from 12 previously released songs by Psychopathic artists, including [[Dark Lotus]], [[Anybody Killa]], Twiztid, [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]] and Insane Clown Posse, on the basis of which instrumentals would be appropriate for story-based songs which would form an album-length storyline.<ref name=JuggaloNews/> Official promotional materials termed the album a "deluxe [[mixtape]]" on the basis of this production style.<ref name=Fontana/> The album's storyline was developed by Violent J, and Cold 187um wrote all of the lyrics based on this story.<ref name=JuggaloNews/><ref name=faygoluvers/><ref name=Fontana/>

== Release and promotion ==

A panflet included with [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s album ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!]]'' listed the release date of ''The Only Solution'' as October 9, 2012. However, the album was pushed back to October 22 to coincide with the release of Twiztid's album ''[[Abominationz]]''.<ref name=faygoluvers>{{cite web|author=Like |url=http://vimeo.com/38710769 |title=Big Hutch Interview - 3/9/12 on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>
