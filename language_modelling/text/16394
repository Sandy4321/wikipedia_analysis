The '''murder of Zoe Nelson''' was committed in the [[Cambusnethan]] suburb of [[Wishaw]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]] on 22 May 2010.

===Body discovered===
At 4.20pm on Sunday 23 May 2010 an off-road motorcyclist spotted what he initially described as "a sort of charred tailor's dummy" in woodland at Monkey Hill, near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, Wishaw.<ref name="bbc1">{{Cite news|date=2 March 2011|title=Murdered teenager Zoe Nelson's body 'like mannequin'|work=[[BBC News]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12623839|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref name="watson">{{Cite news|title=Murder hunt as body of girl, 17 found burned|last=Watson|first=Donna|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=25 May 2010|page=11|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MURDER+HUNT+AS+BODY+OF+GIRL,+17+FOUND+BURNED%3B+Police+pledge+to+catch...-a0227234407|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> As he approached he realised that it was actually a [[Cadaver|corpse]].

Tailor's dummies don't have bones."<ref name=bbc1/> The body was extensively charred, and he was unable to tell if it was that of a male or female.<ref name=watson/>  He immediately went to his nearby home and telephoned the police to report the discovery. When the police arrived he led them to the scene, which [[Sergeant#United Kingdom|Detective Sergeant]] (DS) Clifford Neil of [[Strathclyde Police]] described as "gruesome." The body lay on a makeshift [[pyre]] and had heavy duty plastic sheet partly melted on to the facial area.<ref name="stv1">{{Cite news|title=Detective tells Zoe Nelson murder trial of 'gruesome' find|date=10 March 2011|work=[[stv.tv]]|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/234335-detective-tells-zoe-nelson-murder-trial-of-gruesome-find/|location=Glasgow|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref><ref name="stv2">{{Cite news|title=The promising student and the brutal killer|date=25 March 2011|work=[[stv.tv]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/238944-the-promising-student-and-the-brutal-killer/|accessdate=2011-03-31}}</ref> Strathclyde Police launched a murder inquiry, led by [[Superintendent (police)#United Kingdom|Detective Superintendent]] (D/Supt) Derek Robertson of the force's Major Investigation Unit, on 24 May following the results of a [[autopsy|post-mortem]] examination.

==Murder inquiry==
===Forensic examination===
Near the body was the cap from a bottle of "Sierra Silver" tequila, in the shape of a red plastic [[sombrero]], and a corresponding empty bottle was found on the other side of a small path nearby.<ref name=stv1/> Near one foot police found another bottle which was tested for traces of an [[accelerant]].<ref name=stv1/> Laura Wilcock, a forensic scientist with specialist expertise in examining suspicious fires, concluded that the body could have been burning for up to seven hours, and very little of it was undamaged by the burning.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe murder trial told of DNA match|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=12 March 2011|page=12}}</ref><ref name="bbcdna">{{Cite news|date=11 March 2011|title=Murder trial hears of DNA match|work=[[BBC News]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12717582|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> The palm of the right hand remained relatively undamaged and this was swabbed for [[DNA]] evidence.<ref name="weektwo">{{Cite news|title=Murder trial week two: Zoe's sister says she was taken to see charred body|date=16 March 2011|work=[[Wishaw Press]]|location=Airdrie|url=http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2011/03/16/summary-of-second-week-of-zoe-nelson-trial-76495-28341301/|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> The extensive burning of the body hampered pathologists from ascertaining a cause of death, and Dr. Julia Bell, a forensic pathologist at the [[University of Glasgow Medical School]] said that the possibilities for a full post mortem were "limited". Bell said she was unable to completely exclude the possibility that setting the teenager on fire had killed her but believed "the findings [were] not suggestive of this": while the natural instinct of a person on fire would be to move, there was no evidence of this, probably because Nelson was [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] or dead. Examination of Nelson's [[respiratory tract]] did not demonstrate [[soot]] in the quantities which would indicate she had still been breathing and scientists had been unable to carry out blood analysis which might have provided further proof.<ref name=probe/>

Examination of the tequila bottle found near the body found a mix of Nelson's blood and [[adipose tissue]] on the bottle. Forensic scientist Marie Campbell stated that this was normally the result of a wounding injury causing bleeding and body fat to become mixed, and that similar results were observed on knives examined after stabbings. In this instance, the stains on the tequila bottle "did not have the distinctive pattern she would have expected" if the bottle had been used directly as a weapon.<ref name=weektwo/> When found, the body had a plastic bag partly melted over much of the face, bruising inside the lip, two black eyes and bleeding inside her skull. Pathologists said "some form of throttling or suffocating was the most probable cause of death" and she may have been suffocated with the plastic bag or there might have been pressure applied to the neck.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe Nelson pathologist uncertain how teenager died as body so badly burned|date=16 March 2011|work=[[stv.tv]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/235781-pathologist-tells-court-zoe-nelson-probably-died-of-asphyxiation/|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> Bell said: "There were findings at post-mortem consistent with [[assault]], with such a manner of death in keeping with the circumstances in which her body was found. As to the actual mechanism of her death, perhaps the most likely cause has been some form of [[asphyxia]]. I cannot exclude the possibility that [[Penetrating trauma|sharp force injury]] has been the cause of her death, or [[Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]]." The cause of death was officially recorded as unascertained.<ref>{{Cite news|date=16 March 2011|title=Murdered Zoe Nelson 'too badly burned' for exact cause|work=[[BBC News]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12766064|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe was too badly burned to tell cause of death|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date=17 March 2011|page=9}}</ref>

[[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Detective Constable]] (DC) Jennifer Bell, who had previously been seconded to the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police Service's]] [[SO15]] Counter Terrorism Command, was brought in to the inquiry to examine hours of recovered CCTV footage for sightings of Nelson.

==Arrest of Robert Bayne==
Just before 6pm on 28 May Robert Bayne walked into the police incident caravan at Wishaw and said he wanted to make a statement. The officer on duty, PC Robert Davie, said: "The male appeared to be quite intoxicated. He was slurring his words." Bayne said he had been to [[Motherwell]] several days previously and on the return journey a man called Stewart Campbell had got onto the bus. He told PC Davie: "I went up to Stewart Campbell and said to him 'Were you with Zoe on Saturday night?'" to which he claimed Campbell replied: "Aye, I killed her." As Bayne began to give a description of Campbell, police detectives walked in to the caravan and immediately detained Bayne by snapping [[handcuffs]] on him.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe accused told police he knew identity of killer|date=23 March 2011|work=[[Wishaw Press]]|location=Airdrie|url=http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2011/03/23/zoe-murder-trial-latest-76495-28387701/|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe murder jury hears of drunk in cuffs|date=23 Mar 2011|work=[[Evening Times]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/zoe-murder-jury-hears-of-drunk-in-cuffs-1.1092082?localLinksEnabled=false|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> On the morning of 29 May Strathclyde Police issued a statement saying: "A 20-year-old man has been arrested and is presently detained in police custody in connection with the death [of Zoe Nelson].

==DNA evidence==
Tests on the swab taken from Nelson's hand demonstrated the presence of Nelson's DNA and traces from another person which were found to match parts of Bayne's DNA profile. DNA matching Nelson's and Bayne's was found on both the tequila bottle and its lid found near the body. Marie Campbell suggested the explanation for the presence of the DNA inside the lid was that both had been drinking from the bottle, then put the cap back on. She also said that the odds against the DNA in the plastic sombrero lid coming from anyone but Bayne were 9.6 million to one.<ref name=bbcdna/>

==Trial==
The trial was held over fifteen days at the High Court, Edinburgh in March 2011. Bayne was charged "that in a wooded area near Branchalfield Drive, Cambusnethan, [he] assaulted Zoe Nelson, of Newmains, striking her on the body with a knife, repeatedly hitting her, putting a plastic sheet over her head to restrict her breathing and by means unknown injuring her and setting her on fire." He was further charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice in that he washed or disposed of clothes he had worn at the time of the alleged murder, that he disposed of Nelson's mobile phone and that he threatened her sister Laura Anne. Bayne elected not to take the witness stand during the trial.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe accused will not give evidence|work=[[Evening Times]]|location=Glasgow|date=24 March 2011|page=15}}</ref>

===Testimony of Laura Ann Nelson===
It emerged during the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne on the morning after her murder, but had kept this information from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Five-day riddle at Zoe trial|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=16 March 2011|page=28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Murder trial hears of sister's delay|work=[[Evening Times]]|location=Glasgow|date=16 March 2011|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Sister's tears at Zoe trial|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=15 March 2011|page=15.}}</ref> Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared "jumpy" and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had "something to show her". She said that he led her to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body.<ref>{{Cite news|date=14 March 2011|title=Zoe Nelson murder accused 'took sister to see body'|work=[[BBC News]]|location=Glasgow|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-12737896|accessdate=2011-04-03}}</ref> She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a [[Rangers F.C.]] tattoo on her arm.<ref name=weektwo/> In her statement she said: "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also "described her as happy and normal" during the period of silence.<ref name="atrocity">{{Cite news|title=An atrocity|last=Horne|first=Brian|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=25 March 2011|page=37}}</ref> When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.<ref name=weektwo/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe Nelson<U+2019>s sister 'did not tell police about body find for five days'|date=15 March 2011|work=[[stv.tv]]|url=http://news.stv.tv/scotland/west-central/235420-zoe-nelsons-sister-did-not-tell-police-about-body-find-for-five-days/|accessdate=2011-04-03|location=Glasgow}}</ref>

===Verdict===
On 25 March 2011 the jury of seven men and seven women returned unanimous verdicts of guilty on both charges. As the verdicts were read out, handcuffed Bayne fought with security guards and police officers, [[headbutt]]ing one of them, and shouted abuse at Laura Anne Nelson: "You have fucking got me for fuck all. You're a fucking wee cow. You're dead."  He was forced to the ground in the dock as the judge [[Leeona Dorrian|Lady Dorrian]] QC left the bench and ordered the public to be cleared from the court. The hearing eventually continued without Bayne who was detained in the court cells below.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Zoe's killer flies into rage as he is convicted|last=Horne|first=Brian|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=26 March 2011|page=38}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Crazed rage of Zoe killer|last=Horne|first=Brian|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=26 March 2011|page=5}}</ref> Sentencing was deferred for social background and psychiatric reports.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Killer's threats to victim's sister as he is found guilty|last=Horne|first=Brian|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date=26 March 2011|page=5}}</ref> On 27 April 2011 Bayne was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], with a minimum term of twenty years, for the murder and six years, to be served concurrently, for the second charge.

===Reactions===
Following the verdict, it was revealed that Bayne had been released from prison after he had served an 18-month sentence for assault and [[robbery]] in Hamilton, just seven weeks before he murdered Nelson. He had previously been imprisoned on four occasions, following convictions for drugs charges, assault and theft.<ref name="carmichael">{{Cite news|title=Zoe killer in jail rampage|last1=Carmichael|first1=Charlotte|last2=Stow|first2=Nicola|work=[[News of the World]]|location=London|date=27 March 2011|page=11}}</ref> D/Supt Robertson gave a statement to the media after the verdicts were delivered, saying: "Zoe Nelson was a young 17-year-old girl with everything to live for. She had many friends and a loving family in Newmains. Robert Bayne ruthlessly took her life and tried to dispose of her body in a cold-blooded attack. This was a particularly horrific crime and now that Bayne has been convicted, Zoe's family and the local community can hopefully try and move forward knowing [he] will not be a threat for a considerable period of time. He showed no remorse for his vile actions or the effect this murder had on Zoe's close family, who remain devastated by her loss. When the verdict was raised you saw what he can do. So the streets will be a lot safer, and hopefully the Nelson family can move on knowing that he is behind bars."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Cold-blooded murderer who showed no remorse|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|location=Glasgow|date=26 March 2011|page=5}}</ref> Lady Dorrian said: "This has been... a somewhat distressing case and a stressful one."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Court uproar as killer tells victim's sister: 'You're dead'|last=Ferguson|first=Brian|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=26 March 2011|page=22}}</ref> Nelson's uncle told reporters: "It's a relief to know he's in prison but it's not justice.
