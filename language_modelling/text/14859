'''The Fabulous Ones''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[Tag team]] consisting of [[Stan Lane]] and [[Steve Keirn]] that was active between [[1982]] and [[1987]] with brief reunions during the[[1990s]]. The Fabulous Ones competed primarily in [[North America|North American]] territories such as the [[Continental Wrestling Association]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] and later on the [[United States Wrestling Association]]. The team is considered one of the first teams to adopt the <U+201C>Funloving Pretty Boy<U+201D> gimmick later used by teams such as [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], [[The Fantastics]] and [[the Rockers]]<ref name="Tag">{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | year=2005| id=ISBN 978-1-5502-2683-6}}</ref>.

==History==
Steve Keirn made his professional wrestling debut in [[1972]], working mostly in the Southern territories of the United States. Keirn often found himself working as a tag-team, most notably alongside [[Mike Graham]] in [[Florida Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling from Florida]] <ref name="Titles">{{cite book | author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will | title=Wrestling Title Histories | publisher=Archeus Communications | year=4th Edition 2006 | id=ISBN 0-9698161-5-4 }}</ref>. Keirn had joined the [[Continental Wrestling Association]] in 1981 as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] and held both singles and tag-team gold<ref name="Titles"/>. Stan Lane made his professional debut in [[1974]] and like Keirn had worked mainly in the Southern regions. Lane had come into CWA as a [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in late 1981 but turned face in early [[1982]] feuding with his former manager [[Jimmy Hart]] and his stable of wrestlers<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/memphis/memphis-cwa9-2.htm | title = Kayfabememories: Memphis/CWA (#9-2) | accessmonthday = 10 April | accessyear = 2007| author = Tim Dills | quote = Hart would spend the first part of the year trying to eliminate former First Family member Stan Lane from the area}}</ref>.

===Coming Together===
Steve Keirn and Stan Lane were first brought together in early [[1982]]. Lawler and Jarrett decided to give the two <U+201D>Pretty boys<U+201D> a big push right off the bat, shooting a couple of music videos starring Lane and Keirn set to [[ZZ Top]]<U+2019>s [[Sharp Dressed Man]] and [[Billy Squier]]<U+2019>s <U+201D>Everybody Wants You<U+201D> while wearing top hats, sequin Tuxedos and the likes. This was one of the first times where music videos were used to get a wrestler <U+201D>over<U+201D> (popular) in pro wrestling, a practice more common today. The CWA bookers also persuaded local hero [[Jackie Fargo]] to lend his endorsement to The Fabulous Ones (earning them the nickname <U+201D>Fargo<U+2019>s Fabulous Ones<U+201D>), which gave the team instant credibility in the South.<ref name="Lawler">{{cite book | author= [[Jerry Lawler]]  | title=It<U+2019>s good to be the King<U+2026> Sometimes | publisher= World Wrestling Entertainment | year=2002 | id= ISBN 0-7434-5767-6}}</ref>. The original plan for the Fabulous Ones was for them to dispatch the New York Dolls, then turn heel on Lawler and Dundee and be managed by [[Jim Cornette]], but because of the overwhelming popularity of Lane and Keirn those plans were quickly changed<ref name="Tag"/>. 

====Rising to the top====
Their first feud was against Jimmy Hart<U+2019>s team of [[Troy Graham|<U+201C>Dream Machine<U+201D> Troy Graham]] and [[Rick McGraw]]. Hart countered the promotional push of the Fabulous Ones by producing similar videos for Graham and McGraw <U+2013> dubbing them the <U+201C>New York Dolls<U+201D> and dressing them up in tuxedos and top hats like Lane and Keirn. The Fabulous Ones and the Dolls fought week in and week out in the Mid South Coliseum<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#101182

 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1982 | date = October 18 | Year = 1982 | quote = The Fabulous Ones beat Rick McGraw & Dream Machine}}</ref>. In the early days the Fabulous Ones also feuded with the original version of [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]] ([[Dennis Condrey]], [[Randy Rose]] and [[Norvell Austin]]) including a series of unsuccessful challenges for the Express<U+2019> [[AWA Southern Tag Team Championship|Southern Tag Team Championship]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#053182

Once the Midnight Express lost their titles the Fabulous Ones started to gain victories over the trio both in regular tag<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#061482

 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1982 | date = July 26 | Year = 1982 | quote = Bill Dundee, Bobby Fulton, & The Fabulous Ones beat Dennis Condrey, Norvell Austin, The Iron Sheik, & Jimmy Hart}}</ref> 

On [[October 25]], 1982 Lane and Keirn defeated [[Bobby Eaton]] and [[James Ware (wrestler)|Sweet Brown Sugar]] to win the Southern Tag Team Championship, the first titles that the Fabulous Ones held as a team<ref name="Titles"/>. By this time the Fabulous Ones were a major draw in the CWA and with the Fabulous Ones holding the main tag team title in the promotion they only got more over<ref>{{cite book | author= [[Jerry Lawler]]  | title=It<U+2019>s good to be the King<U+2026> Sometimes | publisher= World Wrestling Entertainment | year=2002 | id= ISBN 0-7434-5767-6 | quote = <U+201D>About as successful a team as we had for a while, they were as hot as could be<U+201D>}}</ref>. The Fabulous Ones<U+2019> popularity came not just from their wrestling skills but also from their charisma and sex appeal that made them especially popular with the female fans<ref>{{cite book | author= [[Jerry Lawler]]  | title=It<U+2019>s good to be the King<U+2026> Sometimes | publisher= World Wrestling Entertainment | year=2002 | id= ISBN 0-7434-5767-6 |  quote = <U+201D>At intermission, they sold a lot of pictures. In the mid-eighties if you had a thousand dollar week you were doing well. Those guys were selling fifteen hundred dollars worth of pictures a week and probably another fifteen hundred in wrestling payoffs.<U+201D>}}</ref>. Lane and Keirn<U+2019>s first run with the titles lasted just under a month as they lost the titles to Bobby Eaton and the Dream Machine on [[November 22]] <ref name="Titles"/> but would regain them from the makeshift team only a week later on [[November 29]] <ref name="Titles"/>.

====Legendary Rivalry====
After dealing with Jimmy Hart<U+2019>s stable the Fabulous Ones suddenly got a whole different team challenging them for the gold. [[Brian Wickens|Luke Williams]] and [[Jonathan Boyd]] ([[The Bushwhackers|The Sheepherders]]) had entered the CWA in the fall of 1982 and soon came head to head with the Fabulous Ones. The Fabulous Ones / Sheepherder feud stands as one of the most memorable and bloody feuds. A feud that would rage on in several promotions between 1982 and 1987. The <U+201C>pretty boy<U+201D>, well polished Fabulous Ones and the ugly, brawling savage Sheepherders made for the perfect opponents and repeatedly drew big gates all over the country <ref name="Tag"/>. The matches started out pretty evenly with the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders splitting the decisions<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#101182
 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1982 | date = December 5 | Year = 1982 | quote = The Fabulous Ones beat The Sheepherders (Boyd & Williams).}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#101182
 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1982 | date = December 13 | Year = 1982 | quote = The Sheepherders (Boyd & Williams) beat The Fabulous Ones}}</ref> but soon turned brutal and often without a definite winner. In December, 1982 the Sheepherders won the Southern Tag Team Championship from Lane and Keirn<ref name="Titles"/> which only turned the intensity of the matches up a notch. Between late December and Mid February the two teams traded the belts back and forth 4 times with the Fabulous Ones ending up with possession of them in the end<ref name="Titles"/>. On [[March 28]] the Sheepherders wrestled their last match in the Mid-South Coliseum before leaving the CWA<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1982.html#101182

 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1983 | date = March 28 | Year = 1983 | quote = The Fabulous Ones, & Steve O, & Dutch Mantel beat The Sheepherders (Boyd & Williams), Jesse Barr, & Adrian Street}}</ref> giving the Fabulous Ones ([[Kayfabe]]) credit for running them out of Memphis.

After the feud with the Sheepherders ended the CWA sought to copy the success of that feud by having the Fabulous Ones face another team in the same mold as the Sheepherders: the [[Moondogs]], in this case [[Randy Colley|Rex]] and [[Spot|Larry Latham (wrestler)]]. On [[April 4]] the Moondogs won the Southern tag-team title in their usual brutal fashion but were unable to keep the titles for long as the Fabulous Ones regained the titles in an equally brutal match only 3 weeks later.<ref name="Titles"/> After disposing of the Moondogs the Fabulous Ones began to feud with a team they had faced early on in their career, Bobby Eaton and Duke Myers. Jimmy Hart<U+2019>s team won the Southern Tag-Team Title but did not hold them for long before they ended up around the waist of Lane and Keirn once more. <ref name="Titles"/> After the Fabulous Ones dropped the Southern Titles to The Grapplers ([[Tony Anthony]] and [[Len Denton]]) the team did not immediately regain the gold, instead the Fabulous Ones would spend the rest of the year in the mid card until finally winning their seventh  from the Bruise Brothers (Troy Graham and Porkchop Cash, not [[Harris Brothers|Ron and Don Harris]]) on [[November 29]]. 

====Going to Texas====
Around the turn of the year the Fabulous Ones and the CWA parted ways with the duo looking to cash in their success in other territories. The first place the Fabulous Ones show up after leaving Memphis is in [[Southwest Championship Wrestling]] from [[San Antonio, Texas]]. The Fabulous Ones supposedly won a tournament in Australia to become the first ever [[SWCW World Tag Team Championship|SCWC World Tag Team Champions]] <ref name="Titles"/>. In reality there was no tournament it was just a way to set reignite the feud between the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders who had been with the SWCW for a while. On [[March 4]], [[1984]] the Sheepherders defeated the Fabulous Ones for the SWCW gold ending Keirn and Lane<U+2019>s brief stay in Texas.

====Welcome Home====
After failing to catch on in Texas the Fabulous Ones returned <U+201D>home<U+201D> to Memphis and were immediately thrust into the tag team title chase. On [[October 8]] the Fabs defeated first the Nightmares then the Dirty White Boys before losing to [[Richard Rood|Rick Rude]] and [[King Kong Bundy]] in a one night tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1984.html#100884
 | title = Mid-South Coliseum Results 1984 | date = October 8 | Year = 1984 | quote = Rick Rude & King Kong Bundy beat The Fabulous Ones via DQ to win the vacant Southern Tag Title}}</ref>. Keirn and Lane soon got their revenge by winning their 8th Southern Tag Team title from Bundy and Rude on [[October 22]]. The team held on to the gold for a little over 6 weeks before losing it to the team of Don Bass and Roger Smith, also known as the Interns. On [[February 17]], [[1985]] the Fabulous Ones regained the Southern Tag-Team championship from the Interns before launching into a feud with the '''PYT Express''' (Koko Ware and Norvell Austin), a team that like the Fabulous Ones played on the <U+201C>Pretty Boy<U+201D> gimmick. On [[April 15]] the PYT Express won the gold through underhanded means and continued to fend off the Fabulous Ones through various <U+201C>shady<U+201D> tactics until they were stripped of the gold in June. After the PYT Express left the area Keirn and Lane easily won the Southern Tag Team Title once more defeating Ron Sexton and Billy Travis in a tournament final.

Next for the Fabulous Ones was the return of an old Nemesis, the Sheepherders <U+2013> in this case [[Rip Morgan]] and Jonathan Boyd teaming up as the <U+201C>Kiwi Sheepherders<U+201D>. Boyd and Morgan quickly made a mark on Memphis by beating the Fabulous Ones for Southern Tag Team Championship on [[June 17]] 1985. The team was soon stripped of the titles due to excessive cheating but had the titles returned to them when Boyd and Morgan threatened to sue CWA management over the incident<ref name="Titles"/>. Instead of taking the titles from the Sheepherders by stripping them the Fabulous Ones took the Southern tag team titles from them the old fashioned way <U+2013> 4 times in a row between [[September 5]] and [[October 12]]<ref name="Titles"/>. The Fabulous Ones won what would turn out to be their last Southern Tag Team Championship on October 12th, their 15th Southern Title all together. Few realized that an era in Memphis wrestling was ending when [[Bill Dundee]] and [[Dutch Mantel]] beat the Fabulous Ones for the titles on [[November 11]]. After dropping the Southern titles Keirn and Lane ventured to Minnesota to work for the [[American Wrestling Association]].

====Life after Memphis====
On [[April 19]], 1985 the Fabulous Ones participated in the first ever [[Jim Crockett Promotions#Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup|Jim Crockett Sr. Memorial Cup]] held in the [[New Orleans, LA]] [[SuperDome]] but lost in the first round to the [[Fantastics]] ([[James Hines|Bobby Fulton]] and [[Thomas Couch|Tommy Rogers]]) <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/cup.html#1st | title = BWA Crockett Cup | date = April 19 | Year = 1986}}</ref>. On [[April 20]] the Fabulous Ones was part of <U+201C>WrestleRock<U+201D>, A stadium show held at the MetroDome in [[Minneapolis, MN]]. Keirn and Lane lost to the team of [[Mike Rotuna]] and [[Barry Windham]] (who previously worked as [[the US Express]] in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]])<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/awa/stadium.html#rock | title = AWA Stadium Shows | date = April 20 | Year = 1986 | quote = Barry Windham & Mike Rotunda beat The Fabulous Ones when Windham pinned Lane}}</ref>

After failing to achieve much success in the AWA Keirn and Lane started working for [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]], the territory where both men had made their debut. In a turn of events that mirrored their time with SWCW the Fabulous Ones <U+201C>won<U+201D> the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] in a fictitious tournament that supposedly took place in [[Portland, OR]]. Just like in the SWCW the team supposedly beat the Sheepherders in the tournament final and just like in the SWCW the Fabulous Ones immediately started feuding with the Sheepherders over the gold. On [[October 7]] the Sheepherders ended the Fabulous Ones<U+2019> first reign with the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] and would keep them away from the Fabs until Lane and Keirn finally got the better of them on [[November 30]] where they regained the belts<ref name="Titles"/>. After losing the Florida US Tag Team title to [[Ray Candy|Kareem Muhammad]] and Hacksaw Higgins

====One last trip to Memphis====
After dropping the Florida titles and the promotion folding briefly Keirn and Lane returned to the territory that they were most successful in, Memphis. In Memphis they once again became entangled in a feud with the Sheeperhders in a rivalry that up until this point seemed like it would never end. In what would turn out to the last series of matches between the Sheepherders and the Fabulous Ones the Fabs dominated the matches<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1987.html#020987  | title = Mid South Coliseum Shows (1987) | date = February 9 | Year = 1987 | quote = The Fabulous Ones beat The Sheepherders in a "massacre" match.}}</ref> and once again <U+201C>Ran off<U+201D> the Sheepherders<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/memphis/jarrett/1987.html#020987  | title = Mid South Coliseum Shows (1987) | date = February 16 | Year = 1987 | quote = The Fabulous Ones & Paul Diamond beat The Sheepherders & Jonathon Boyd in a "barbed wire cage" match}}</ref>. The feud with the Sheepherder turned out to be the last moment of glory for the Fabulous Ones as their 5 year run together was about to come to an end.

===Break up and beyond===
In the early parts of 1987 Dennis Condrey left [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] from one day to the next, he literally abandoned [[the Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|the Midnight Express]] when they were scheduled to appear at an event in [[Los Angeles]] as he changed his plane ticket to go somewhere else so he could drop out of sight<ref name="Tag"/>. Manager [[Jim Cornette]] brought in a man that [[Bobby Eaton]] was familiar with, having feuded with him extensively in Memphis <U+2013> Stan Lane. When Lane joined Eaton to form the new Midnight Express it put the final nail in the coffin of the Fabulous Ones, ending their 5 year run<ref name="Tag"/>.

When Lane left [[World Championship Wrestling]] in late 1990 he reunited with Steve Keirn, working as the Fabulous Ones in the [[United States Wrestling Alliance]] where they won the tag-team titles from [[Tony Anthony]] and [[Doug Gilbert]] on [[January 7]], [[1991]] <ref name="Titles"/>. The Fabs held on to the titles for approximately 3 weeks before a match against Jerry Lawler and [[Jeff Jarrett]] got out of control and the titles were vacated. After leaving the USWA in 1991 the Fabs only teamed sporadically, most notably in [[1995]] where the duo competed in the <U+201C>Best of Memphis<U+201D> Tag-Team tournament which they won by beating Tommy Rich and [[Doug Gilbert]] in the finals<ref name="Tag"/>. Since then the Fabulous Ones only reunite on special occasions with both Lane and Keirn enjoying semi-retirement.

===Innovators and immitators===
The Fabulous Ones have often been credited with being the innovators of the "Pretty Boy" gimmick for tag teams and one of the first teams to popularize the use of music videos to help make them popular. With the success of the Fabulous Ones it wasn't long before promoters all over the country started to immitate their formula, even the Memphis promoters used the formular again and again with success<ref name="Tag"/>. The first team to really use the Fabulous Ones' formular was [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], a fact admitted to by Jerry Lawler.<ref name="Lawler"> and then later on [[The Fantastics]] (who were originally billed as "The Fantastic Ones)<ref name="Tag"/>.  Other teams have used the "fun loving pretty boy" gimmick but none more successfully than [[The Rockers]], a team that started out in Memphis as the "Midnight Rockers" but soon rose to national stardom first in the AWA and later on the WWF<ref name="Tag"/>.
