'''''Science Fantasy''''', which also appeared under the titles '''''Impulse''''' and '''''SF Impulse''''', was a British [[fantasy fiction magazine|fantasy]] and [[science fiction magazine]], launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as a companion to Nova's ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]''. [[Walter Gillings]] was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by [[John Carnell]], the editor of ''New Worlds'', as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by [[Roberts & Vinter]], who hired [[Kyril Bonfiglioli]] to edit ''Science Fantasy''; Bonfiglioli changed the title to ''Impulse'' in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to ''SF Impulse'' for the last few issues. ''Science Fantasy'' ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.

Gillings had an inventory of material that he had acquired while editing ''[[Fantasy (1946 magazine)|Fantasy]]'', and he drew on this for ''Science Fantasy'', as well as incorporating his own [[fanzine]], ''Science Fantasy Review'', into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, ''Science Fantasy'' typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], [[Kenneth Bulmer|Ken Bulmer]], and [[Brian Aldiss]], whose first novel ''[[Nonstop]]'' appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during the latter half of the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of ''Science Fantasy'' was always higher than that of ''New Worlds'', and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including [[Keith Roberts]], [[Brian Stableford]] and [[Josephine Saxton]]. In the opinion of science fiction historian [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]], the final year of ''Impulse'', as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.

Walter Gillings was the editor for the first two issues; John Carnell took over for the remainder of the 1950s. Underlining indicates that the magazine was titled with the season (e.g. "Summer 1950") for that issue. Issue 7 was only dated with the year, 1954.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=Tuck>"Science-Fantasy", in Tuck, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy Vol. 3'', pp.&nbsp;586&ndash;587.</ref>]]
In early 1946, British fan [[John Carnell]] launched a new science fiction (sf) magazine titled ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'', published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but Pendulum went out of business before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.<ref name=SFFWFM_NW>Mike Ashley, "New Worlds", in Tymn & Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines'', pp.&nbsp;423&ndash;437.</ref>

At the same time that the first issue of ''New Worlds'' appeared, a separate British magazine called ''[[Fantasy (1946 magazine)|Fantasy]]'' was launched by [[Walter Gillings]], a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. ''Fantasy'' lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories<U+2014>enough to fill nine issues.<ref name=SFFWFM_F>Mike Ashley, "Fantasy (1946&ndash;1947)", in Tymn & Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines'', pp.&nbsp;256&ndash;257.</ref> Gillings followed the demise of ''Fantasy'' by publishing a [[fanzine]], titled ''Fantasy Review'', beginning in March 1947.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF>Mike Ashley, "Science Fantasy (1950&ndash;1966)", in Tymn & Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines'', pp.&nbsp;505&ndash;510.</ref>

In 1950, with ''New Worlds'' on a stable quarterly schedule, Nova Publications decided to launch a companion, ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=SFFWFM_NW/> They chose Gillings as the editor, and his fanzine, which had been retitled ''Science Fantasy Review'' in 1949, was incorporated in the new magazine as a department. The first issue was dated Summer 1950, but printing disputes meant that the second issue was delayed until winter. [[Rationing_in_the_United_Kingdom#Paper|Paper rationing]] delayed the third issue to Winter 1951, but before it appeared, Nova decided that it could no longer afford to have separate editors for ''New Worlds'' and ''Science Fantasy'', and Gillings was let go.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> According to Carnell, there were also "fundamental differences of opinion" that led to the decision to replace him.<ref name=VV_78>Harbottle & Holland, ''Vultures of the Void'', pp.&nbsp;78&ndash;79.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Gillings felt betrayed by the decision, and in combination with a family bereavement this led to him disappearing from the British science fiction world for twenty years.<ref name=T_75-6>Ashley, "Transformations", pp.&nbsp;75&ndash;76.</ref>|group=notes}}

After the Spring 1953 issue Nova Publications decided to switch printers, in order to cut costs and bring the cover price down from [[<U+00A3>sd|2/-]] (10 p) to 1/6 (7.5 p). The new printers, The Carlton Press, failed to keep to the agreed printing schedule, and produced poor quality work; there were also printers' strikes, and this disruption caused extended delays in the appearance of the seventh issue.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=VV_78/> While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell's, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and [[John Wyndham]]. Goldsmith covered the conference for ''[[Illustrated (magazine)|Illustrated]]'', a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of [[Maclaren & Sons Ltd]], a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine.  Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova Publications, with a commitment to produce ''New Worlds'' on a monthly basis and ''Science Fantasy'' on a bimonthly schedule. Maclaren's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute with The Carlton Press, and the seventh issue of ''Science Fantasy'' finally appeared with a cover date of March 1954.<ref name=VV_100-3>Harbottle & Holland, ''Vultures of the Void'', pp.&nbsp;100&ndash;103.</ref>

In 1958, Nova decided to launch a British reprint of the American magazine ''[[Science Fiction Adventures (1956 magazine)|Science Fiction Adventures]]'', under the same title. The British ''[[Science Fiction Adventures (British magazine)|Science Fiction Adventures]]'' lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> ''New Worlds'', Nova's flagship title, and ''Science Fantasy'' were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000,<ref name=T_231-7/> though a switch from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>{{#tag:ref|A plan to switch to a monthly schedule was announced in the editorial of the August 1963 issue; this was surprising in view of the low circulation as normally a monthly schedule would be undertaken only by a successful magazine.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>|group=notes}} In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles,<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> and in preparation for the change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, ''[[New Writings in SF]]'', for publisher [[Dennis Dobson]].<ref name=T_231-7/> Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from [[Michael Moorcock]], published in the April 1964 ''New Worlds'', asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying U.S. magazines.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>

===Roberts & Vinter===
[[File:Science Fantasy 1960s issues grid.png|thumb|400px|left|Issues of ''Science Fantasy'' in the 1960s, showing volume/issue number, and color-coded to show who was editor for each issue. John Carnell was the editor until April 1964, after which Kyril Bonfiglioli took over. The last five issues were edited by Keith Roberts and Harry Harrison. Issues 65 through 69 were titled with the name of two consecutive months<U+2014>e.g. issue 66 was dated July&ndash;August 1964.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name="Tuck"/>]]In early 1964, David Warburton of [[Roberts & Vinter]], an established publisher, heard from the printer of ''Science Fantasy'' and ''New Worlds'' that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: ''Science Fantasy'' and ''New Worlds'' both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, [[John Menzies]] and [[W H Smith|W.H. Smith]].<ref name=T_231-7>Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;231&ndash;237.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Warburton's partner, Godfrey Gold, published pin-up magazines, and was also interested in the magazines for the same reason.<ref name=T_231-7/>|group=notes}} Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to ''New Writings in SF'', and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; [[Kyril Bonfiglioli]], an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of [[Brian Aldiss]], also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose ''New Worlds'', and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=T_231-7/> Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June&ndash;July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart<U+2014>for example, June&ndash;July 1964 was followed by July&ndash;August 1964.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.<ref name=T_337-8>Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;337&ndash;338.</ref>

Bonfiglioli often bought material from writers without an established reputation; he did not make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, but he also had a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants<U+2014>first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.<ref name=T_243-6/> 

Bonfiglioli disliked the title of the magazine, feeling that it "promised the worst of both worlds"; he proposed ''Caliban'' as the new title, but the publisher dissuaded him. He settled on ''Impulse'' instead, and the magazine appeared under the new title starting with the March 1966 issue.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=SFFWFM_I/> The paperback format was unchanged, but the volume numeration was restarted at volume 1 number 1, to "sever all connections with ''Science Fantasy''", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. The name change proved to be disastrous; there was already a magazine called ''Impulse'', and this caused distribution problems. In addition, treating ''Impulse'' as a new magazine meant a fresh distribution contract was needed. Bonfiglioli attempted to repair the damage by changing the name to ''SF Impulse'' starting in August 1966, but the result was a dramatic drop in circulation.<ref name=SFFWFM_I/>

By late 1966 Bonfiglioli had made enough money from his antiques dealing to be able to retire to [[Jersey]]. [[J.G. Ballard]] was briefly involved with the magazine in an editorial role, but his aims for the magazine were too far from the publisher's goals and he was quickly replaced by [[Harry Harrison]]. Harrison almost immediately had to leave England and handed over much of the day-to-day management of the magazine to Keith Roberts.<ref name=SFFWFM_I/><ref name=T_245-8>Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;245&ndash;248.</ref> Despite the setback from Bonfiglioli's title change, the magazine was still profitable, but in July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, [[Thorpe & Porter]], went bankrupt while owing Roberts & Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to decide to focus on their more profitable magazines, and the February 1967 issue of ''SF Impulse'' was the last, though ''New Worlds'', the sister magazine, survived via an [[Arts Council of Great Britain|Arts Council]] grant obtained by Brian Aldiss's efforts.<ref name=SFFWFM_I/><ref name=T_245-8/>

==Contents and reception==
===1950s===
[[File:Science Fantasy Winter 1951 cover.png|thumb|right|300px|R.M. Bull's cover for the third issue (middle, top row) is "strikingly reminiscent of the work of [[Margaret Brundage]] for ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the thirties", according to sf historian [[David Kyle]].<ref name=Kyle_119/>]]In the first issue, Gillings declared that he was interested in science fantasy "in all its forms: with its significant ideas, its surprising prophecies, its sheer fictions, its evolution as a fascinating literature".<ref>{{cite journal |year=1950 |month=Summer |title=Fantasies and Facts |journal=Science Fantasy |volume=I |issue=1 |page=3}}</ref> Stories in the first issue, drawn from Gillings' inventory of material acquired for ''Fantasy'', included "The Belt", by [[James Morgan Walsh|J.M. Walsh]]; "Time's Arrow", by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]; and "Monster", by [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]], writing as Christopher Youd.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> Gillings also included several non-fiction features, such as his fanzine, ''Science Fantasy Review'', incorporated into ''Science Fantasy'' as a department, and condensed to a few pages. In the first issue Gillings reviewed an article about science fiction by [[Jacob Bronowski]] which had appeared in the ''[[Daily_Mail#Continental_and_Overseas_Daily_Mail|Continental Daily Mail]]''.<ref name=issues>See the individual issues. For convenience, an online index is available at {{Cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/wiki/index.php/Magazine:Science_Fantasy |title=Magazine:Science Fantasy&nbsp;<U+2014> ISFDB |accessdate=26 February 2011 |work=www.isfdb.org |publisher=Al von Ruff (Publisher)}}</ref> There were also three book review columns: two by Gillings, writing under pseudonyms, and one by John Aiken, the son of poet [[Conrad Aiken]].<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>

When Carnell took over, he planned to distinguish ''Science Fantasy'' from its sister magazine, ''New Worlds'', by adding more fantasy, while printing nothing but sf in ''New Worlds'',<ref name=VV_78/> though it took some time for the two magazines to develop separate personalities.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> Carnell also dropped the non-fiction features, though he did start a series of guest editorials, starting with Gillings in the third issue and [[H. J. Campbell|H.J. Campbell]] in the fourth issue.<ref name=VV_78/><ref name=issues/> The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren gave Carnell access to the publishing facilities of a well-established company, and to established distribution channels, which freed him to focus on his editorial duties.<ref name=VV_100-3/> Carnell tended to put longer stories in ''Science Fantasy'' than in ''New Worlds'', and ''Science Fantasy'' typically ran a long lead novelette with several short stories.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=ESF_1061>Brian Stableford, "Science Fantasy", in Clute & Nicholls, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;1061.</ref> Stories that would not have suited ''New Worlds'' began to appear, such as [[William F. Temple]]'s "Eternity" (February 1955), in which aliens mysteriously provide haloes to thousands of people, and Dal Stiven's "Free Will", which featured robot ghosts. Stories in the whimsical fantasy tradition that had been started by ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'', however, did not often appear in ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=ESF_1061/>

Many of the lead novelettes in the 1950s were provided by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] and [[Kenneth Bulmer|Ken Bulmer]]. Brunner's first appearance was in September 1955 with "The Talisman"; over the next few years he wrote both science fiction and fantasy for ''Science Fantasy'', including "A Time to Read" (December 1956), an alternate-world fantasy, and "Lungfish" (December 1957), a [[generation ship|generation starship]] story. Bulmer's first appearance in ''Science Fantasy'' was in June 1955, with "Psi No More"; he contributed regularly thereafter. A short version of Brian Aldiss's first novel, [[Nonstop]], appeared in the February 1956 issue, and Aldiss subsequently contributed some experimental stories.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> From 1956 onwards the magazine contained substantially more fantasy than sf.<ref name=EF_844/>

In Carnell's opinion, the literary quality of ''Science Fantasy'' was "far higher" than that of ''New Worlds'', but ''New Worlds'' was always the better-selling of the two magazines.<ref name=VV_100-3/> Carnell's determination to keep the quality high led him to delay publishing issue 20 for two months because of a "lack of suitable material".<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1956 | month = November | title = Editorial-In-Brief | journal=New Worlds Science Fiction | volume = 18 | issue = 53 | page = 20}}</ref> His efforts were rewarded by frequent appearances of stories from ''Science Fantasy'' in the annual ''Year's Greatest SF'' anthology series edited by [[Judith Merril]]. Carnell occasionally used reprints, often selecting stories in line with the magazine's focus on offbeat fantasy, such as [[Fritz Leiber]]'s "Space-Time for Springers", and [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s "The Graveyard Reader". Towards the end of the 1950s Carnell began to reintroduce non-fiction, and starting in 1959 he printed a series of articles by [[Sam Moskowitz]] on key figures in the early history of sf, such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]]; these articles, which had first appeared in American magazines such as ''[[Satellite Science Fiction]]'', were later collected as ''Explorers of the Infinite''.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> The artwork was of variable quality, in the opinion of critic [[Brian Stableford]]; among the better covers Stableford cites the work of [[Brian Lewis (artist)|Brian Lewis]], who supplied almost all ''Science Fantasy''{{'}}s cover art from 1958 through 1961.<ref name=ESF_1061/> Historian David Kyle commented on the "remarkable" cover by R.M. Bull for the third issue, which he regarded as "strikingly reminiscent of the work of Margaret Brundage for ''Weird Tales'' in the thirties."<ref name=Kyle_119>Kyle, ''Pictorial History of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;119.</ref>

===1960s===
In the early 1960s, [[Thomas Burnett Swann]] became strongly associated with ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> He had published a couple of genre short stories before beginning to sell to Carnell with "The Dryad-Tree" in the August 1960 issue.<ref name=issues/><ref name=EF_TBS>John Clute, "Thomas Burnett Swann", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', pp.&nbsp;912&ndash;913.</ref> Swann's speciality was historical fantasy, and ''Where Is the Bird of Fire?'', his retelling of the [[Romulus and Remus]] myth, which was serialised in ''Science Fantasy'' in 1962, "received more praise than any other [novelette] in recent years", according to Carnell.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1962 | month = October| journal=Science Fantasy | volume = XIX | issue = 55 | page = 71}}</ref> Swann was one of the three mainstays of ''Science Fantasy'' in the early 1960s: the others were Michael Moorcock and J.G. Ballard.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> Ballard's first story in ''Science Fantasy'' was "Prima Belladona", which appeared in the December 1956 issue; his work over the next few years was ideally suited to ''Science Fantasy'' and he became a regular contributor.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard's more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with ''Science Fantasy'' and ''New Worlds'' reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of [[New Wave science fiction]].<ref name=T_231-7/> Moorcock's [[Elric of Melnibon<U+00E9>]] series, about a [[sword and sorcery]] anti-hero, began with "The Dreaming City" in the June 1961 ''Science Fantasy'', and Moorcock appeared frequently thereafter: he had either a story or an essay (and sometimes both) in all but four of the remaining issues edited by Carnell.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=issues/> [[Terry Pratchett]]'s first story, "The Hades Business", appeared in the August 1963 issue.<ref name=EF_783>David Langford, "Terry Pratchett", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', p.&nbsp;783.</ref> Ashley regards the early 1960s as one of the high points of the magazine;<ref name=EF_844>Mike Ashley, "Science Fantasy", in Clute & Grant, ''Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', p.&nbsp;844.</ref> it was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for each of the last three years in which Carnell edited it, from 1962 to 1964, but it never won.<ref name=FD>Franson & DeVore, ''A History of the Hugo, Nebula, and International Fantasy Awards'', pp.&nbsp;22&ndash;25.</ref>

When Kyril Bonfiglioli took over in 1964, he complained in his first editorial that he had "just read through a quarter of a million words of ms [manuscript] and half of it was so bad it made me blush".<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1964 | month = June&ndash;July| title = Editorial | journal=Science Fantasy | volume = XXII | issue = 65 | page = 2}}</ref> He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, "written before I got the hang of things", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, "They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted".{{#tag:ref|Quoted by Mike Ashley from private correspondence with Aldiss.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>|group=notes}} Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, "Jael Cracken" and "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included [[Keith Roberts]]' first two stories: "Escapism", a [[time travel]] tale, and "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>{{#tag:ref|In fact Carnell had been the first editor to buy from Roberts, but the stories he acquired for ''New Writings in SF'' did not appear until after Roberts appeared in ''Science Fantasy''.<ref name=T_243-6>Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&nbsp;243&ndash;246.</ref>|group=notes}} ''The Day of the Minotaur'', another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title ''The Day of the Blue Monkeys''. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included [[Josephine Saxton]] and Brian Stableford.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/> Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe ''Science Fantasy'' under Bonfiglioli's editorship as "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".<ref name=HESF_166>Christopher Priest, "New Wave", in Holdstock, ''Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', p.&nbsp;166.</ref>

At the [[23rd World Science Fiction Convention|World Science Fiction Convention]] in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several well-known writers to appear in an "all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice{{' "}}. The issue in question was the first one under the new title of ''Impulse'', in March 1966; it included fiction by [[James Blish]], Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, [[Poul Anderson]], [[Jack Vance]], and Keith Roberts, who contributed "The Signaller", the first story in his ''[[Pavane (novel)|Pavane]]'' sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another ''Pavane'' story and a short story by John Brunner from his "Traveller in Black" series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of ''Impulse'' contained "some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines".<ref name=SFFWFM_I/> [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]]'s first story, "The Run", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and [[Chris Boyce]]'s second story, "George", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in ''Impulse'', both well-received: Harry Harrison's ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'' (later made into the movie ''[[Soylent Green]]''), and Moorcock's ''The Ice Schooner''. Other notable stories listed by Ashley include [[Thomas Disch]]'s "The Roaches" and "The Number You Have Just Reached", and Aldiss's "The Eyes of the Blind King".<ref name=SFFWFM_I/> Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.<ref name=ESF_1061/>

==Bibliographic details==
The editorial succession at ''Science Fantasy'' was as follows:<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=SFFWFM_I>Mike Ashley, "Impulse", in Tymn & Ashley, ''Science Fiction, Fantasy and Weird Fiction Magazines'', pp.&nbsp;350&ndash;352.</ref>
* [[Walter Gillings]]: Summer 1950 &ndash; Winter 1950.
* [[John Carnell]]: Winter 1951&ndash;1952 &ndash; April 1964.
* [[Kyril Bonfiglioli]]: June&ndash;July 1964 &ndash; September 1966.
* [[Harry Harrison]] and [[Keith Roberts]]: October 1966 &ndash; February 1967.

The publisher was Nova Publications until April 1964, and Roberts & Vinter Ltd thereafter.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=SFFWFM_I/>

''Science Fantasy'' was [[digest size|digest-sized]] for its first two issues. The size increased to a large digest for the next four issues, but with issue seven it returned to a small digest again, and remained in that format until the June&ndash;July 1964 issue, which was issued in paperback format. The remaining issues, including all those under the ''Impulse'' title, were published as paperbacks. It initially was priced at 2/-; the price was cut to 1/6 for the third issue, but returned to 2/- with the seventh issue. With issue 11 (December 1954) the price returned to 2/-, and it rose to 2/6 with issue 46 and to 3/- with issue 61. When the format changed to paperback with issue 65 the price dropped again to 2/6, and remained there until the title change to Impulse. All the twelve ''Impulse'' issues were priced at 3/6. The page count began at 96, and rose to 128 with issue 7. Issues 36 through 63 were 112 pages, and the final digest-sized issue was 124 pages. The paperback issues were 128 pages under the ''Science Fantasy'' title, and 160 pages for the ''Impulse'' issues.  Volume numbering began with two volumes of three issues, but the second volume began with volume 2, number 4 instead of restarting the issue number at 1 as would usually be done.  From issue 7 the volume number was dropped completely.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=SFFWFM_I/>

The schedule was initially quite irregular, with the first two issues, in Summer and Winter 1950, followed almost a year later by a Winter 1951&ndash;52 issue. Spring and Autumn 1952 were followed by Spring 1953 and then another long delay to the seventh issue which was dated 1954, without a month or season given. The schedule became more regular thereafter, with May 1954 inaugurating a bimonthly schedule that lasted till November 1955, except that September 1954 was followed by a December issue, and June 1955 was followed by September. After February, May and August 1955, the December 1956 issue began a regular bimonthly sequence that was marred only by the appearance of a November 1959 issue between the August and December issues. After the switch to paperback, the sequence ran as follows: June&ndash;July 1964, July&ndash;August 1964, September&ndash;October 1964, December 1964 &ndash; January 1965, January&ndash;February 1965, and then monthly from March 1965 to the end.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/><ref name=SFFWFM_I/>

There have been no anthologies drawn solely from the pages of ''Science Fantasy'', but ''Weird Shadows From Beyond'', edited by John Carnell, and published by [[Transworld (company)|Corgi Books]] in 1965, drew eight of its ten stories from the magazine.<ref name=SFFWFM_SF/>
