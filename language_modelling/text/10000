The '''Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939''' was a military operation that started on [[September 17]], [[1939]], during the early stages of [[World War II]], sixteen days after the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[invasion of Poland (1939)|attack on Poland]]. It ended in a decisive victory for the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Red Army]].

In early 1939, the Soviet Union tried to form an anti-German alliance with the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Poland]], and [[Romania]]; but several difficulties arose, including the refusal of Poland and Romania to allow Soviet troops into their territories as part of [[collective security]].<ref name="Cienciala">[[Anna M.

As a result, on [[1 September]], the Germans invaded Poland from the west; and on [[17 September]], the [[Red Army]] invaded Poland from the east. The Soviet government announced that it was acting to protect the [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]] who lived in the [[Kresy|eastern part of Poland]], because the Polish state had collapsed in the face of the German attack and could no longer guarantee the security of its own citizens.<ref name="SCHULENBURG">Telegrams sent by [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg|Schulenburg]], German ambassador to the Soviet Union, from Moscow to the German Foreign Office: [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/ns069.htm No. 317] of [[September 10]], [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/ns073.htm No. 371] of [[September 16]], [http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/ns074.htm No. 372] of [[September 17]].

The Soviet invasion, which the [[Politburo]] called "the liberation campaign", led to the incorporation of western Ukrainians and western Belarusians into the Soviet [[Ukrainian SSR|Ukrainian]] and [[Byelorussian SSR|Byelorussian]] [[Soviet republic|republics]].<ref>Rieber, p 29.</ref> During the existence of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the invasion was considered a delicate subject, almost [[taboo]], and was often omitted from official history in order to preserve the illusion of "eternal friendship" between members of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name="Ferro"/>

==Prelude==

In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union tried to form an anti-German alliance with the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Poland]].{{Ref_label|h|h|none}} The negotiations, however, proved difficult. The Soviets insisted on a sphere of influence stretching from Finland to Romania and asked for military support not only against anyone who attacked them directly but against anyone who attacked the countries in their proposed sphere of influence.<ref>Shaw, p 119; Neilson, p 298.</ref> They also demanded the right to enter [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and the [[Baltic States]] whenever they felt their security was threatened. The governments of those countries rejected the proposal because, as [[Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs|Polish foreign minister]] [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]] pointed out, they feared that once the Red Army entered their territories, it might never leave.<ref name="Cienciala"/> The Soviets did not trust the British and French to honour [[collective security]], since they had failed to [[Spanish Civil War|assist Spain]] against the [[Fascists]] or [[Treaty of Munich|protect Czechoslovakia]] from the Nazis. They also suspected that the [[Western Allies]] would prefer the Soviet Union to fight Germany by itself, while they watched from the sidelines.<ref>Kenez, pp. 129<U+2013>31.</ref> In view of these concerns, the Soviet Union abandoned the negotiations and turned instead to an alliance with Germany.

On [[23 August]] [[1939]], the Soviet Union signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany, taking the allies by surprise. The two governments announced the agreement merely as a [[non-aggression pact|non-aggression treaty]]. As a secret [[appendix]] reveals, however, they had actually agreed to partition Poland between themselves and divide [[Eastern Europe]] into Soviet and German [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].{{Ref_label|d|d|none}} The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which has been described as a license for war, was a key factor in Hitler<U+2019>s decision to [[invasion of Poland|invade Poland]].<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref>Davies, ''Europe: A History'', p. 997.</ref>

Soon after the Germans [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invaded]] Poland on September 1, the Nazi leaders began urging the Soviets to play their agreed part and attack Poland from the east. The German ambassador to [[Moscow]], [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]], and the Soviet [[List of Russian foreign ministers| foreign minister]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], exchanged a series of diplomatic communiqu<U+00E9>s on the matter.<ref name="SCHULENBURG"/> The Soviets delayed their intervention for several reasons. They were distracted by crucial events in their [[Soviet-Japanese Border Wars| war with Japan]]; they needed time to mobilise the Red Army; and they saw a diplomatic advantage in waiting until Poland had disintegrated before making their move.<ref name="Zaloga-blitz">[[Steven J.

==Military campaign==
[[Image:Poland1939 after 14 Sep.jpg|thumb|right|Situation after [[September 14]], [[1939]].]]

The Red Army entered the [[Kresy|eastern regions of Poland]] with seven [[field army|field armies]] and between 450,000 and 1,000,000 troops.<ref name="Sanford"/> These were deployed on two [[Front (Soviet Army)|fronts]]: the [[Belorussian Front (1939)|Belarusian Front]] under [[Mikhail Kovalyov]], and the [[Ukrainian Front (1939)|Ukrainian Front]] under [[Semyon Timoshenko]].<ref name="Sanford"/> By this time, the Poles had failed to [[Battle of the Border|defend their western borders]], and in response to German incursions had launched a major counter-offensive in the [[Battle of the Bzura]]. The Polish Army originally had a well-developed [[Plan Wsch<U+00F3>d|defensive plan to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union]], but they were unprepared to face two invasions at once.<ref name="Wsch<U+00F3>d">Szuba<U+0144>ski, ''Plan operacyjny "Wsch<U+00F3>d"''.</ref> By the time the Soviets invaded, the Polish commanders had sent most of their troops west to face the Germans, leaving the east protected by only 20 under-strength battalions. These battalions consisted of about 20,000 troops of border defence corps (''[[Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza]]''), under the command of general [[Wilhelm Orlik-Rueckemann]].<ref name="Wojsko"/><ref name="Sanford">[[George Sanford (scholar)|Sanford]], [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415338735&id=PZXvUuvfv-oC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&ots=_1tnCiY3_f&dq=Soviet+invasion+of+Poland+1939&sig=WpYsVr5jLk6yIVAYnQqeR3hdXMU p. 20-24.]</ref>

At first, the Polish [[commander-in-chief]], [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]], ordered the border forces to resist the Soviets. He then changed his mind after consulting with [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Felicjan S<U+0142>awoj Sk<U+0142>adkowski]] and ordered them to fall back and engage the Soviets only in self-defense.<ref name="Wojsko"/><ref name="Gross">Gross, p. 17.</ref> The two conflicting sets of orders led to confusion,<ref name="Sanford"/> and when the Red Army attacked Polish units, clashes and small battles inevitably broke out.<ref name="Wojsko"/> The response of non-ethnic Poles to the situation added a further complication. In some cases, [[Ukrainians]],{{Ref_label|m|m|none}} [[Belarusians]]<ref>Piotrowski, p 199.</ref> and [[Jews]]<ref>Gross, pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref> welcomed the invading troops as liberators. The [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]] rose against the Poles, and communist partisans organised local revolts, for example in [[Skidel]].<ref name="Sanford"/>{{Ref_label|j|j|none}}

The Polish military's original fall-back plan was to retreat and regroup along the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], an area in south-east Poland near the border with Romania. The idea was to adopt defensive positions there and wait for a promised French and British attack in the west. This plan assumed that Germany would have to reduce its operations in Poland in order to fight on a second front.<ref name="Sanford"/> The allies expected Polish forces to hold out for up to several months, but the Soviet attack made this strategy obsolete.

[[Image:Nationalities in Second Polish Republic ca. 1931.png|thumb|right|200px|Dominant nationalities in Poland and surrounding regions, 1931]]

The Polish political and military leaders knew that they were losing the war against Germany even before the Soviet invasion settled the issue.<ref name="Sanford"/> Nevertheless, they refused to surrender or negotiate a peace with Germany. Instead, the Polish government ordered all military units to evacuate Poland and reassemble in [[France]].<ref name="Sanford"/> The government itself crossed into [[Romania]] at around midnight on [[17 September]]. Polish units proceeded to manoeuvre towards the Romanian bridgehead area, sustaining German attacks on one flank and occasionally clashing with Soviet troops on the other. In the days following the evacuation order, the Germans defeated the Polish [[Army Krak<U+00F3>w|Armies ''Krak<U+00F3>w'']] and [[Army Lublin|''Lublin'']] at the [[Battle of Tomasz<U+00F3>w Lubelski]], which lasted from 17 to 20 September.<ref>Taylor, p. 38.</ref>

Soviet units often met their German counterparts advancing from the opposite direction. Several notable examples of co-operation occurred between the two armies in the field. The [[Wehrmacht]] passed the [[Brest Fortress]], which had been seized after the [[Battle of Brze<U+015B><U+0107> Litewski]], to the Soviet 29th Tank Brigade on [[17 September]].<ref name="Fischer">[[Benjamin B.

Despite a tactical Polish victory on [[28 September]] at the [[Battle of Szack]], the outcome of the larger conflict was never in doubt.<ref name="Interia-Szack"/> Civilian volunteers, [[militia]]s, and reorganised retreating units [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|held out in the Polish capital]], [[Warsaw]], till [[28 September]]. The [[Modlin Fortress]], north of Warsaw, surrendered the next day after [[battle of Modlin|an intense sixteen-day battle]].

Kleeberg surrendered on [[6 October]] after the four-day [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]] (near [[Lublin]]), which ended the September Campaign. The Soviets were victorious. On [[31 October]], Molotov reported to the [[Supreme Soviet]]: "A short blow by the German army, and subsequently by the Red Army, was enough for nothing to be left of this ugly creature of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]".<ref>Moynihan, p. 93; Tucker, p. 612.</ref>

To which Stalin replies, "The bloody assassin of the workers, I presume?"]]

The reaction of France and Britain to Poland's plight was muted, since neither wanted a confrontation with the Soviet Union at that stage.<ref name="prazmowska"/> Under the terms of the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact|Anglo-Polish Agreement]] of [[25 August]] [[1939]], the British had promised Poland assistance if attacked by a European power;{{Ref_label|k|k|none}} but when Polish Ambassador [[Edward Raczy<U+0144>ski]] reminded [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs| Foreign Secretary]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] of the pact, he was bluntly told that it was Britain's business whether to declare war on the Soviet Union.<ref name="prazmowska"/> [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]] considered making a public commitment to restore Polish statehood, but in the end he issued only general statements of condemnation.<ref name="prazmowska">Prazmowska, pp. 44<U+2013>45.</ref>

The French had also made promises to Poland, including the provision of air support, and these were not honoured. Once the Soviets moved into Poland, the French and the British decided there was nothing they could do for Poland in the short term and began planning for a long-term victory instead. The French had advanced tentatively into the [[Saar Offensive|Saar]] in early September, but after the Polish defeat, they retreated behind the [[Maginot Line]] on [[October 4]].<ref>Jackson, p. 75.</ref> Many Poles resented this lack of support from their western allies, which aroused a lasting sense of [[Western betrayal| betrayal]].

==Notes==
'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} Increasing numbers of KOP units, as well as most Polish Army units stationed in the East during peacetime, were sent to the Polish-German border before or during the German invasion. KOP forces guarding the eastern border numbered around 20,000.<ref name="Sanford"/> On [[21 September]], an improvised KOP "army" had a strength of 8,700 troops. Polish army units which fought the Soviets had mostly been disrupted and weakened by their retreat from the Germans, making estimates of their strength problematic; it is estimated about 250,000 of such troops found themselves in the line of Soviet advance and offered sporadic resistance.<ref name="Sanford"/> The total Polish army on [[1 September]] [[1939]], counting un-mobilized (and sometimes, never mobilized) units, numbered about 950,000.<ref name="PWN_KW_old"/> Historians agree that the vast majority of these forces never saw action against the Soviets.

The first figure is based on NKVD records and does not include the roughly 180,000 prisoners of war in Soviet captivity. Most modern historians estimate the number of all people deported from areas taken by the Soviet Union during this period at between 800,000 and 1,500,000. For example, [[R. J. Rummel|Rummel]] estimates the number at 1,200,000 and Kushner and Knox at 1,500,000.<ref>Rummel, p. 132; Kushner, p. 219.</ref> Bernd Wegner quotes [[Norman Davies]]'s estimate that half of an approximately one million deported Polish citizens were dead by the time the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]] was signed in 1941.<ref name="DavWag">Wegner, p. 78.</ref>

The mass deportations were motivated by class warfare<U+2014>Soviet propaganda hammered home the message that they were fighting a war against barbarism on behalf of civilization<U+2014>and obsessive security concerns. Less openly admitted advantages of the deportations were the redistribution of deportees' housing and land, the establishment of a back-up labour force prior to the inevitable war with Germany, and the radical alteration of the ethnic demographic of the annexed region.<ref name="Rieber14,32-37"/>

'''n.''' {{Note_label|n|n|none}} "The Soviet Union's invasion and occupation of Eastern Poland in September 1939 was a clear act of aggression in international law...But the Soviets did not declare war, nor did the Poles respond with a declaration of war. As a result there was confusion over the status of soldiers taken captive and whether they qualified for treatment as PoWs. Jurists consider that the absence of a formal declaration of war does not absolve a power from the obligations of civilised conduct towards PoWs.
