'''Cyclone Inigo''' is tied for the most intense <!--in terms of pressure--> [[tropical cyclone|cyclone]] in the [[List of Australian region cyclone seasons|Australian cyclone region]] on record. It developed from a tropical disturbance that crossed eastern [[Indonesia]] in late [[March 2003]]. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on [[April 1]], Inigo [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa)]] on [[April 4]]. An approaching [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on [[April 8]] Inigo dissipated after making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on [[Western Australia]] as a minimal tropical storm.

The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Indonesia, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. The worst of the damage was on [[Flores]] island, though damage was also reported on [[West Timor]] and [[Sumba]]. The flooding and mudslides damage or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many to leave their homes. A total of 58&nbsp;casualties were reported in association with the disturbance. In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but little damage.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Inigo 2003 track.png}}
By [[March 26]], an area of disturbed weather was located within the [[near-equatorial trough]] near [[Papua New Guinea]]. Initially located within an area of easterly [[wind shear]], it tracked westward due to the presence of a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its south, and on [[March 27]] a [[low pressure area]] formed over [[Western New Guinea]]. Thunderstorm activity increased around a mid-level circulation as it crossed into the [[Arafura Sea]], and its overall organization continued to increase. On [[March 29]], a low-level circulation was visible, though significant tropical development was prevented due to wind shear and land interaction with islands in the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago. It developed into a tropical low on [[March 30]], and after turning to the southwest, it crossed the island of [[Flores]] on [[March 31]]; upon doing so its [[convection]] greatly increased due to increased [[tropical cyclone#mechanics|upper-level divergence]], which produced heavy rainfall on Flores and [[Timor]]. On [[April 1]], wind shear decreased as it crossed into the [[Savu Sea]], and by early on [[April 1]] it developed into a tropical cyclone to the northeast of [[Sumba]].<ref name="bom">{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology Special Services Unit|year=2003|title=Tropical Cyclone Inigo (March 30 - April 8)|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=2008-01-05|url=http://ssu1.bom.gov.au/wa/cyf/reports/Inigo/Inigo.htm}}</ref>

At 1200&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on [[April 1]], the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) issued its first advisory on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 26S. At 0000&nbsp;UTC on [[April 2]], the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) warning center in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Inigo.<ref name="gp">{{cite web|author=Gary Padgett|year=2003|title=April 2003 Worldwide Tropical Weather Summary|accessdate=2008-01-05|url=http://www.australiansevereweather.com.au/cyclones/2003/summ0304.htm}}</ref> The storm quickly intensified as it tracked southwestward, aided by low wind shear and strong divergence. An [[eye (cyclone)|eye featured]] gradually organized,<ref name="bom"/> and early on [[April 3]] the BOM classified Inigo as a severe tropical cyclone with winds of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h).<ref name="gp"/> Later that day, the cyclone underwent [[rapid deepening|rapid intensification]] as the eye became increasingly better defined. On [[April 4]], Inigo attained Category&nbsp;5 status on the [[Tropical cyclone scales|Australian cyclone scale]], and at 0600&nbsp;UTC it reached peak winds of 240&nbsp;km/h (150&nbsp;mph) and an estimated minimum pressure of 900&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|hPa]] ([[bar (unit)|mbar]]) while located about 950&nbsp;km (590&nbsp;mi) north of [[Onslow, Western Australia]].<ref name="bom"/> Around the same time, the JTWC assessed Inigo as a powerful cyclone with 1-min winds of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph).<ref name="gp"/> With a minimum pressure of 900&nbsp;hPa, Inigo tied [[1998-99 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season#Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda|Cyclone Gwenda]] of the [[1998-99 Southern Hemisphere tropical cyclone season|1998-99 season]] as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the [[List of Australian region cyclone seasons|Australian cyclone region]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2006|title=Australian Region Best Track 1907-2006|accessdate=2007-11-04|format=Zip|url=ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/anon2/home/ncc/cyclone/cyclones_newformat.zip}}</ref>

Upon reaching peak intensity, Inigo maintained an eyewall 32&nbsp;km (20&nbsp;mi) in diameter. Late on [[April 4]], an approaching upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] increased wind shear over the system, which caused a steady weakening trend.<ref name="bom"/> On [[April 5]], the eye became cloud-filled, and later that day the cyclone reached its westernmost point before the approaching trough turned it to the southeast.<ref name="gp"/> By [[April 7]], its winds decreased to below severe tropical cyclone status, or below 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph). The convection continued to decrease, leaving the center exposed from the convection as it made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] early on [[April 8]] in the [[Pilbara]] region of [[Western Australia]]. Upon moving ashore, Inigo had winds of around 75&nbsp;km/h (45&nbsp;mph), and the circulation dissipated within 12&nbsp;hours after moving ashore.<ref name="bom"/>

The precursor tropical disturbance dropped heavy rainfall in eastern [[Indonesia]];<ref name="gp"/> on the island of [[Flores]], [[Larantuka]] recorded 223&nbsp;mm (8.78&nbsp;in) in a 24&nbsp;hour period. The rainfall caused [[flash flood]]ing and mudslides, primarily in Flores but also on [[West Timor]]<ref name="ocha1">{{cite web|author=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|date=2003-04-03|title=Indonesia - Landslides OCHA Situation Report No. 1|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=2008-01-06|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/ACOS-64CUJB?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=SL-2003-0155-IDN}}</ref> and [[Sumba]].<ref name="bom"/> In some locations, the depth of the floodwaters reached 5&nbsp;meters (16&nbsp;ft). The Oessao River in [[West Timor]] exceeded its banks, which flooded seven villages. In [[Kupang]] in West Timor, the system destroyed hundreds of homes and large fields of corn, bean, and rice crop. Heavy damage was reported near [[Ende, Indonesia|Ende]], where flooding and mudslides destroyed 20&nbsp;houses and destroyed the roads connecting to East Flores.<ref name="ocha1"/> In Ende, a total of 294&nbsp;animals were killed.<ref name="ocha2">{{cite web|author=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|date=2003-11-04|title=Indonesia: OCHA Consolidated Situation Report No. 123|publisher=ReliefWeb|accessdate=2008-01-08|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/ACOS-64D9XQ?OpenDocument&rc=3&emid=SL-2003-0155-IDN}}</ref>  The city airport was flooded with one meter (3&nbsp;ft) of water, preventing aerial transportation and which left the city temporarily isolated. In East Flores Regency in eastern Flores Island, the system left 75&nbsp;destroyed houses, along with 77 severely damaged and a further 56 receiving light damage.<ref name="ocha1"/> Damage in Indonesia totaled less than $6&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $6.8&nbsp;million 2007&nbsp;USD),<ref name="bom"/> and 102&nbsp;injuries were reported. The Indonesian representative to the Tropical Cyclone Committee of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] in 2004 reported the death toll related to the disaster in Indonesia as 58&nbsp;fatalities.<ref name="wmo"/>

Additionally, the precursor disturbance produced rough seas along the coastlines, which resulting in the sinking of 12&nbsp;sailing vessels.<ref name="wmo">{{cite web|author=RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South Pacific and South-East Indian Ocean|year=2004|title=Final Report for the Tenth Tropical Cyclone Committee Session|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|page=7|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-06|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/TCP_vO/Reports/RA5_TCC10.pdf}}</ref> Two ships, each with a crew of five to eight people, were reported missing to the southwest of Sumba after Cyclone Inigo passed over their location on [[April 3]].<ref name="bom"/>

Inigo moved ashore on Australia as a weak tropical cyclone, though several locations reported winds of near gale force.<ref name="bom"/> The storm dropped light to moderate precipitation near where it made landfall which peaked at 226&nbsp;mm (8.90&nbsp;inches), of which 128&nbsp;mm (5.04&nbsp;in) of rain fell in 80&nbsp;minutes.<ref name="bom0403">{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|year=2003|title=Significant Weather - April 2003|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=2008-01-06|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/public/sigwxsum/sigw0403.shtml}}</ref> No casualties or significant damage was reported in the country.<ref name="bom"/>

==Aftermath==
Shortly after the storm passed through Indonesia, local government and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Rec Cross]] officials distributed assistance to the storm victims, including food, medicine, clean water, and mattresses; additionally, the government sent about $400&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;[[Indonesian rupiah|IDR]], $50,000&nbsp;2003&nbsp;USD). The affected citizens resided in temporary shelters, including schools, police offices, and shelters built by local governments. Officials deployed machines to remove debris from the roads affected by the landslides.<ref name="ocha1"/>

As a result of its damage, the name '''Inigo''' was [[list of retired tropical cyclone names|retired]] subsequent to its usage; its name was replaced with '''Iggy'''.<ref>{{cite web|author=World Meteorological Organization Tropical Cyclone Programme|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Operational Plan for South Pacific and Southeast Indian Ocean|accessdate=2008-01-08|url=http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/TCP-24OP-PLN2006edition-english.pdf}}</ref>
