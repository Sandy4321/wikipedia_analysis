==Modern procedure==

If anesthesia is to be used there are several options: [[local anesthetic]] cream (EMLA cream) can be applied to the end of the penis 60<U+2013>90 minutes prior to the procedure; local anesthetic can be injected at the base of the penis to block the dorsal penile nerve; local anesthetic can be injected in a ring around the middle of the penis in what is called a subcutaneous ring block.<ref name = "AAP1999"/> It is also possible to use general anesthetics in the case of adult surgery, though not the standard practice.

For infant circumcision, devices such as the [[Gomco clamp]], [[Plastibell]], and [[Mogen clamp]] are commonly used,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Holman JR, Lewis EL, Ringler RL |title=Neonatal circumcision techniques |journal=American Family Physician |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=511<U+2013>8, 519<U+2013>20 |year=1995 |month=August |pmid=7625325}}</ref> together with a restraining device.<ref name="Example of restraint system used">http://www.natus.com/index.cfm?page=products_1&crid=110&contentid=203</ref>

With all these devices the same basic procedure is followed. First, the amount of foreskin to be removed is estimated. The foreskin is then opened via the preputial orifice to reveal the [[glans penis|glans]] underneath and ensure it is normal. The inner lining of the foreskin (preputial epithelium) is then bluntly separated from its attachment to the glans. The device is then placed (this sometimes requires a [[dorsal slit]]) and remains there until blood flow has stopped. Finally, the foreskin is amputated.<ref name = "AAP1999"/> Sometimes, the [[frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] band may need to be broken or crushed and cut from the corona near the urethra to ensure that the glans can be freely and completely exposed.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Neonatal Circumcision: An Audiovisual Primer |publisher=Stanford School of Medicine |url=http://newborns.stanford.edu/Circumcision.html}}</ref>

[[File:plastibell circumcision.jpg|left|thumb|Plastibell Circumcision day 4 post operation]]
* With the [[Plastibell]], once the glans is freed the Plastibell is placed over the glans, and the foreskin is placed over the Plastibell. A [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] is then tied firmly around the foreskin and tightened into a groove in the Plastibell to achieve [[hemostasis]]. Foreskin distal to the ligature is excised and the handle is snapped off the Plastibell device. The Plastibell falls from the penis after the wound has healed, typically in four to six days.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Barrie H, Huntingford PJ, Gough MH |title=The Plastibell Technique for Circumcison |journal=British Medical Journal |volume=2 |issue=5456 |pages=273<U+2013>5 |year=1965 |month=July |pmid=14310205 |pmc=1845746 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.5456.273}}</ref>
* With a Gomco clamp, a section of skin is dorsally crushed with a [[hemostat]] and then slit with scissors. The foreskin is drawn over the bell shaped portion of the clamp and inserted through a hole in the base of the clamp. The clamp is tightened, "crushing the foreskin between the bell and the base plate." The crushed blood vessels provide hemostasis. The flared bottom of the bell fits tightly against the hole of the base plate, so the foreskin may be cut away with a scalpel from above the base plate.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Peleg D, Steiner A |title=The Gomco circumcision: common problems and solutions |journal=American Family Physician |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=891<U+2013>8 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9767725}}</ref>
* With a Mogen clamp, the foreskin is pulled dorsally with a straight hemostat, and lifted. The Mogen clamp is then slid between the glans and hemostat, following the angle of the corona to "avoid removing excess skin ventrally and to obtain a superior cosmetic result" to Gomco or Plastibell circumcisions. The clamp is locked, and a scalpel is used to cut the skin from the flat (upper) side of the clamp.<ref name="Pfenninger">{{Cite book|author=Fowler, Grant C.; Pfenninger, John L. |title=Pfenninger and Fowler's procedures for primary care |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-323-00506-7}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref name="Reynolds">{{Cite journal|author=Reynolds RD |title=Use of the Mogen clamp for neonatal circumcision |journal=American Family Physician |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=177<U+2013>82 |year=1996 |month=July |pmid=8677833}}</ref>

We therefore advocate an impartial meta-analysis of individual patients' data from this and other trials underway before further feasibility studies are done. |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69513-5 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dowsett |first=G.W. |coauthors=M.

In addition to the studies which provided information about female-to-male transmission, some studies have addressed other transmission routes. A randomised controlled trial in Uganda found that male circumcision did not reduce male to female transmission of HIV. The authors could not rule out the possibility of higher risk of transmission from men who did not wait for the wound to fully heal before engaging in intercourse.<ref>{{Cite journal

====Other sexually transmitted infections====
Studies evaluating the effect of circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 [[meta-analysis]] of observational data from twenty-six studies found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]] and possibly genital [[herpes]].<ref name = "Weiss">{{Cite journal|author=Weiss HA, Thomas SL, Munabi SK, Hayes RJ |title=Male circumcision and risk of syphilis, chancroid, and genital herpes: a systematic review and meta<U+2010>analysis |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=101<U+2013>9; discussion 110 |year=2006 |month=April |pmid=16581731 |pmc=2653870 |doi=10.1136/sti.2005.017442}}</ref>  More recently, a 2010 review of clinical trial data found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%.

===Hygiene, and infectious and chronic conditions===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (1999) stated: "Circumcision has been suggested as an effective method of maintaining penile hygiene since the time of the Egyptian dynasties, but there is little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene."<ref name = "AAP1999" />

An inflammation of the glans penis and foreskin is called [[balanoposthitis]]; that affecting the glans alone is called [[balanitis]]. Both conditions are usually treated with topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (clotrimazole cream) or low-potency steroid creams. Although not as necessary as in the past, circumcision may be considered for recurrent or resistant cases.<ref>{{Cite web

[[Phimosis]] is the inability to retract the foreskin over the glans penis; authors frequently distinguish between "physiologic" phimosis (or developmental non-retractility) and "pathological" phimosis.<ref name="hayashi2011"/>  The latter is most commonly caused by [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]], for which circumcision is the preferred treatment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Becker K |title=Lichen sclerosus in boys |journal=Dtsch Arztebl Int |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=53<U+2013>8 |year=2011 |month=January |pmid=21307992 |pmc=3036008 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2011.053 |url=}}</ref>  The American Medical Association states that circumcision, properly performed, protects against the development of phimosis.<ref name = "CSA:I-99" /> Rickwood and other authors have argued that many infant circumcisions are performed unnecessarily for developmental non-retractability of the prepuce rather than for pathological phimosis.<ref name="Rickwood">{{Cite journal|author=Rickwood AM, Walker J |title=Is phimosis overdiagnosed in boys and are too many circumcisions performed in consequence? |journal=Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England |volume=71 |issue=5 |pages=275<U+2013>7 |year=1989 |month=September |pmid=2802472 |pmc=2499015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Shankar KR, Rickwood AM |title=The incidence of phimosis in boys |journal=BJU International |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=101<U+2013>2 |year=1999 |month=July |pmid=10444134 |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410x.1999.00147.x}}</ref> Metcalfe ''et al.'' stated that "Gairdner and Oster made a strong case for leaving boys uncircumcised, allowing the natural separation of the foreskin from the glans to take place gradually, and instructing boys in proper hygiene.

====Urinary tract infections====
Circumcision is associated with a reduced risk of [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs) however the magnitude of this benefit is likely to outweigh the risk only in those at high risk of UTIs.<ref name="singhgrewal2005">{{Cite journal|author=Singh-Grewal D, Macdessi J, Craig J |title=Circumcision for the prevention of urinary tract infection in boys: a systematic review of randomised trials and observational studies |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=8 |pages=853<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=15890696 |pmc=1720543 |doi=10.1136/adc.2004.049353}}</ref>

Some UTI studies have been criticized for not taking into account a high rate of UTI's among premature infants, who are usually not circumcised because of their fragile health status.<ref name = "AAP1999" /> The AMA stated that "depending on the model employed, approximately 100 to 200 circumcisions would need to be performed to prevent 1 UTI," and noted one decision analysis model that concluded that circumcision was not justified as a preventative measure against UTI.<ref name = "CSA:I-99" />

===Penile cancer===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (1999) stated that studies suggest that neonatal circumcision confers some protection from penile cancer, but circumcision at a later age does not seem to confer the same level of protection. Further, because penile cancer is a rare disease, the risk of penile cancer developing in an uncircumcised man, although increased compared with a circumcised man, remains low.<ref name = "AAP1999" />

Micali ''et al'' describe penile cancer as an "emerging problem", noting that "public health measures, such as prophylactic use of circumcision, have proven successful".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Micali G, Nasca MR, Innocenzi D, Schwartz RA |title=Penile cancer |journal=J.

While the same study found an association between adult circumcision and an increased risk of invasive penile cancer, the authors suggested this association was possibly due to adult circumcisions being used as a treatment for penile cancer or a condition that is a precursor to cancer, rather than the procedure itself raising the risk of cancer.<ref name="larke2011">{{cite journal |author=Larke NL, Thomas SL, Dos Santos Silva I, Weiss HA |title=Male circumcision and penile cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1097<U+2013>110 |year=2011 |month=August |pmid=21695385 |doi=10.1007/s10552-011-9785-9 |url= |pmc=3139859}}</ref> It has been suggested that this may be due, in part, to reduced risk of phimosis, a predisposing factor for penile cancers.<ref name="larke2011"/>

{{Main|History of male circumcision}}

The origination of male circumcision is not known with certainty. It has been variously proposed that it began as a religious sacrifice, as a [[rite of passage]] marking a boy's entrance into adulthood, as a form of [[magical thinking|sympathetic magic]] to ensure virility or fertility, as a means of enhancing sexual pleasure, as an aid to hygiene where regular bathing was impractical, as a means of marking those of higher social status, as a means of humiliating enemies and slaves by symbolic [[castration]], as a means of differentiating a circumcising group from their non-circumcising neighbors, as a means of discouraging [[masturbation]] or other socially proscribed sexual behaviors, as a means of removing "excess" pleasure, as a means of increasing a man's attractiveness to women, as a demonstration of one's ability to endure pain, or as a male counterpart to [[menstruation]] or the breaking of the [[hymen]], or to copy the [[Aposthia|rare natural occurrence of a missing foreskin]] of an important leader, and as a display of disgust of the [[smegma]] produced by the [[foreskin]]. It has been suggested that the custom of circumcision gave advantages to tribes that practiced it and thus led to its spread.<ref>{{cite journal |

It is possible that circumcision arose independently in different cultures for different reasons.

The oldest documentary evidence for circumcision comes from [[ancient Egypt]]<ref>Tomb artwork from the [[Sixth Dynasty]] (2345<U+2013>2181 BCE) shows men with circumcised penises, and one [[relief]] from this period shows the rite being performed on a standing adult male. The[[Egyptian hieroglyph]] for "penis" depicts either a circumcised or an erect organ. The examination of Egyptian mummies has found some with foreskins and others who were circumcised.</ref> and Greek historian [[Herodotus]] states that "the Egyptians and those who have learned it from them are the only people who practise circumcision".<ref>Herodotus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=2:chapter=36&highlight=circumcision ''The Histories, 2.36''], on Perseus</ref> Circumcision was common, although not universal, among ancient [[Semitic]] peoples.<ref>The book of Genesis records circumcision as God's covenant/command to Abraham. It was to be performed by the male child's eighth day after birth. [[Herodotus]], writing in the fifth century BCE, lists the[[Colchis|Colchians]], [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Phoenicians]], and [[Syria]]ns as a circumcising cultures.</ref> In the aftermath of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]], however, Greek dislike of circumcision (they regarded a man as truly "naked" only if his prepuce was retracted) led to a decline in its incidence among many peoples that had previously practiced it.<ref>The writer of the [[1 Maccabees]] wrote that under the [[Seleucid]]s, many Jewish men attempted to hide or reverse their circumcision so they could exercise in Greek [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]], where nudity was the norm. First Maccabees also relates that the Seleucids forbade the practice of [[brit milah]] (Jewish circumcision), and punished those who performed it<U+2013>as well as the infants who underwent it<U+2013>with death.</ref>

Circumcision has ancient roots among several ethnic groups in sub-equatorial Africa, and is still performed on adolescent boys to symbolize their transition to warrior status or adulthood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marck |first=J |year=1997 |month= |title=Aspects of male circumcision in sub-equatorial African culture history|journal=Health Transit Review |volume=7 |issue=supplement |pages=337<U+2013>360|pmid=10173099 }}</ref>

===Non-religious circumcision===
Infant circumcision was taken up in the United States, Australia and the English-speaking parts of [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[New Zealand]] and to a lesser extent in the [[United Kingdom]].
There are several hypotheses to explain why infant circumcision was accepted in the United States about the year 1900. The [[germ theory of disease]] elicited an image of the human body as a conveyance for many dangerous germs, making the public "germ phobic" and suspicious of dirt and bodily secretions. The penis became "dirty" by association with its function, and from this premise circumcision was seen as preventative medicine to be practised universally.<ref name="Gollaher1994">{{Cite journal

In 1949, the United Kingdom's newly formed [[National Health Service]] removed infant circumcision from its list of covered services, and circumcision has since been an [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket cost]] to parents. Among men (aged 15 years or older) who are neither Jews nor Muslims, the overall prevalence of circumcision in the UK is 6% according to the WHO's estimates.<ref name="WHO-GTPDSA"/> When "data from

This is despite an increase in the proportion of the British population describing their ethnicity as nonwhite"; indeed, the proportion of newborns circumcised in England and Wales has fallen to less than one percent.

Some argue that the medical problems that have their risk reduced by circumcision are already rare, can be avoided, and, if they occur, can usually be treated in less invasive ways than circumcision. [[Margaret Somerville|Somerville]] states that the removal of healthy genital tissue from a minor should not be subject to parental discretion and that physicians who perform the procedure are not acting in accordance with their ethical duties to the patient.<ref name = "Somerville" /> Denniston states that circumcision is harmful and asserts that in the absence of the individual's consent, non-therapeutic child circumcision violates several ethical principles that govern medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.humanehealthcare.com/Article.asp?art_id=620|title=Circumcision and the Code of Ethics, George C.

Williams (2003) argued that human attitudes toward the pain that animals (including humans) experience may not be based on [[speciesism]], developing an analogy between attitudes toward the pain pigs endure while having their tails [[Docking (animal)|docked]], and "our culture's indifference to the pain that male human infants experience while being circumcised."<ref>{{Cite journal

In some cultures, males must be circumcised shortly after birth, during childhood, or around puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision is commonly practised in the [[Jewish]] and [[Islamic]] faiths.

[[Halakha|Jewish law]] states that circumcision is a ''[[613 mitzvot|mitzva aseh]]'' ("positive commandment" to perform an act) and is obligatory for Jewish-born males and for non-circumcised Jewish male converts. It is only postponed or abrogated in the case of threat to the life or health of the child.<ref name="pmid10349410"/> It is usually performed by a ''[[mohel]]'' on the eighth day after birth in a ceremony called a ''[[Brit milah]]'' (or ''Bris milah'', colloquially simply ''bris''), which means "Covenant of circumcision" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. It is considered of such importance that in Orthodox communities, the body of an uncircumcised Jewish male will sometimes be circumcised before burial.<ref name = "MLamm">{{cite book |last1=Lamm |first1=Maurice|title=The Jewish way in death and mourning |year=2000 |origyear= 1969|publisher= Jonathan David Publishers, Inc|location=[[Middle Village, Queens|Middle Village]], [[New York|NY]] |isbn=0-8246-0423-7 |lccn=99-088942 |pages=215<U+2013>216 |chapter=6: Special Situations |quote=The custom is to circumcise male infants who have not undergone circumcision until then, usually during ''taharah''.}}</ref> Although 19th century[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] leaders described it as "barbaric", the practice of circumcision "remained a central rite"<ref name="origin-reform">{{Cite web

| quote=The Paediatrics & Child Health Division, The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) has prepared this statement on circumcision of infant boys for doctors and to assist parents who are considering having this procedure undertaken on their male children. Circumcision of males has been undertaken for religious and cultural reasons for many thousands of years and it remains an important ritual in some religious and cultural groups. In Australia and New Zealand, the circumcision rate has fallen in recent years and it is estimated that currently 10-20% of newborn male infants are circumcised. Recently there has been renewed debate regarding both the potential health benefits and the ethical and human rights issues relating to infant male circumcision. Circumcision is generally a safe procedure but there are risks of minor complications and some rare but serious complications. The most important conditions where benefits may result from circumcision are recurrent urinary tract infections in children; and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) plus some other sexually transmitted infections in adults from populations with a high prevalence of these conditions; cancer of the penis in men with a history of phimosis, and cancer of the cervix in women whose partners engage in sexual practices known to increase the risk of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection. The protection against Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV is less clear-cut in Australia and New Zealand than in high prevalence countries. Ethical and human rights concerns have been raised regarding elective infant male circumcision because it is recognised that the foreskin has a functional role, the operation is non-therapeutic and the infant is unable to consent.<br /> After reviewing the currently available evidence, the RACP believes that the frequency of diseases modifiable by circumcision, the level of protection offered by circumcision and the complication rates of circumcision do not warrant routine infant circumcision in Australia and New Zealand. However it is reasonable for parents to weigh the benefits and risks of circumcision and to make the decision whether or not to circumcise their sons. When parents request a circumcision for their child the medical attendant is obliged to provide accurate unbiased and up to date information on the risks and benefits of the procedure. Parental choice should be respected. When the operation is to be performed it should be undertaken in a safe, child-friendly environment by an appropriately trained competent practitioner, capable of dealing with the complications, and using appropriate analgesia.}}

===Canada===
The Fetus and Newborn Committee of the [[Canadian Paediatric Society]] posted "Neonatal circumcision revisited" in 1996 and "Circumcision: Information for Parents" in November 2004. The 1996 position statement says that "circumcision of newborns should not be routinely performed",<ref name = "CMAJ2">{{Cite journal

"We undertook this literature review to consider whether the CPS should change its position on routine neonatal circumcision from that stated in 1982. The review led us to conclude the following. There is evidence that circumcision results in an approximately 12-fold reduction in the incidence of UTI during infancy. The overall incidence of UTI in male infants appears to be 1% to 2%. The incidence rate of the complications of circumcision reported in published articles varies, but it is generally in the order of 0.2% to 2%. Most complications are minor, but occasionally serious complications occur. There is a need for good epidemiological data on the incidence of the surgical complications of circumcision, of the later complications of circumcision and of problems associated with lack of circumcision. Evaluation of alternative methods of preventing UTI in infancy is required. More information on the effect of simple hygienic interventions is needed. Information is required on the incidence of circumcision that is truly needed in later childhood. There is evidence that circumcision results in a reduction in the incidence of penile cancer and of HIV transmission. However, there is inadequate information to recommend circumcision as a public health measure to prevent these diseases. When circumcision is performed, appropriate attention needs to be paid to pain relief. The overall evidence of the benefits and harms of circumcision is so evenly balanced that it does not support recommending circumcision as a routine procedure for newborns. There is therefore no indication that the position taken by the CPS in 1982 should be changed. When parents are making a decision about circumcision, they should be advised of the present state of medical knowledge about its benefits and harms. Their decision may ultimately be based on personal, religious or cultural factors."
</ref> and the 2004 information to parents says: 'Circumcision is a "non-therapeutic" procedure, which means it is not medically necessary. Parents who decide to circumcise their newborns often do so for religious, social, or cultural reasons. [. . .] After reviewing the scientific evidence for and against circumcision, the CPS does not recommend routine circumcision for newborn boys. Many paediatricians no longer perform circumcisions.'<ref name = "CPSIFP2">{{Cite web

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], the [[Royal Dutch Medical Association]] (KNMG) stated in 2010 that non-therapeutic male circumcision "conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity." They called on doctors to inform caregivers seeking the intervention of the (in their assessment) medical and psychological risks and lack of convincing medical benefits. They stated that there are as good reasons for legal prohibition of male circumcision as exist for [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).<ref name=KNMG>{{Cite web|title=Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors (2010) |publisher=KNMG |date=12 June 2010 |url=http://knmg.artsennet.nl/Diensten/knmgpublicaties/KNMGpublicatie/Nontherapeutic-circumcision-of-male-minors-2010.htm}}</ref>

===United Kingdom===
The British Medical Association states that "Male circumcision that is performed for any reason other than physical clinical need is termed non-therapeutic (or sometimes "ritual") circumcision. Some people ask for non-therapeutic circumcision for religious reasons, some to incorporate a child into a community, and some want their sons to be like their fathers. Circumcision is a defining feature of some faiths".

The BMA provides that "male circumcision is generally assumed to be lawful provided that it is performed competently; it is believed to be in the child's best interests; and there is valid consent" from both parents and the child, if possible".

The BMA stipulates that "competent children may decide for themselves; the wishes that children express must be taken into account; if parents disagree, non-therapeutic circumcision must not be carried out without the leave of a court; consent should be confirmed in writing".

"In the past, circumcision of boys has been considered to be either medically or socially beneficial or, at least, neutral. The general perception has been that no significant harm was caused to the child and therefore with appropriate consent it could be carried out. The medical benefits previously claimed, however, have not been convincingly proven, and it is now widely accepted, including by the BMA, that this surgical procedure has medical and psychological risks. It is essential that doctors perform male circumcision only where this is demonstrably in the best interests of the child. The responsibility to demonstrate that non-therapeutic circumcision is in a particular child's best interests falls to his parents. The BMA considers that the evidence concerning health benefit from non-therapeutic circumcision is insufficient for this alone to be a justification for doing it."<ref name = "BMAGuide" />

===United States===
The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (1999) stated: "Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision. In the case of circumcision, in which there are potential benefits and risks, yet the procedure is not essential to the child's current well-being, parents should determine what is in the best interest of the child."<ref name = "AAP1999" /> The AAP recommends that if parents choose to circumcise, analgesia should be used to reduce pain associated with circumcision. It states that circumcision should only be performed on newborns who are stable and healthy.<ref name = "AAP1999" />

The [[American Medical Association]] supports the AAP's 1999 circumcision policy statement with regard to non-therapeutic circumcision, which they define as the non-religious, non-ritualistic, not medically necessary, elective circumcision of male newborns. They state that "policy statements issued by professional societies representing Australian, Canadian, and American pediatricians do not recommend routine circumcision of male newborns."<ref name = "CSA:I-99"/>

The [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (2007) recognizes the controversy surrounding circumcision and recommends that physicians "discuss the potential harms and benefits of circumcision with all parents or legal guardians considering this procedure for their newborn son."<ref name = "AAFP2">{{Cite web

| publisher = [[American Academy of Family Physicians]]
| quote = Considerable controversy surrounds neonatal circumcision. Putative indications for neonatal circumcision have included preventing UTIs and their sequelae, preventing the contraction of STDs including HIV, and preventing penile cancer as well as other reasons for adult circumcision. Circumcision is not without risks. Bleeding, infection, and failure to remove enough foreskin occur in less than 1% of circumcisions. Evidence-based complications from circumcision include pain, bruising, and meatitis. More serious complications have also occurred. Although numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate these postulates, only a few used the quality of methodology necessary to consider the results as high level evidence.<br /> <br /> The evidence indicates that neonatal circumcision prevents UTIs in the first year of life with an absolute risk reduction of about 1% and prevents the development of penile cancer with an absolute risk reduction of less than 0.2%. The evidence suggests that circumcision reduces the rate of acquiring an STD, but careful sexual practices and hygiene may be as effective. Circumcision appears to decrease the transmission of HIV in underdeveloped areas where the virus is highly prevalent. No study has systematically evaluated the utility of routine neonatal circumcision for preventing all medically-indicated circumcisions in later life. Evidence regarding the association between cervical cancer and a woman's partner being circumcised or uncircumcised, and evidence regarding the effect of circumcision on sexual functioning is inconclusive. If the decision is made to circumcise, anesthesia should be used.<br /> <br /> The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends physicians discuss the potential harms and benefits of circumcision with all parents or legal guardians considering this procedure for their newborn son.

The [[American Urological Association]] (2007) stated that neonatal circumcision has potential medical benefits and advantages as well as disadvantages and risks, recommending that "circumcision should be presented as an option for health benefits".<ref name="AUApolicy">{{Cite web|url=http://www.auanet.org/content/guidelines-and-quality-care/policy-statements/c/circumcision.cfm |title=Circumcision |accessdate=2008-11-02 |author=American Urological Association }}</ref>
