'''Basanite''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|/<U+02C8>bas<U+0259>n<U+028C><U+026A>t/}}) is an [[igneous rock|igneous]], volcanic ([[extrusive]]) [[rock (geology)|rock]] with [[aphanitic]] to [[porphyritic]] texture. The mineral assembly is usually abundant [[feldspathoid]]s ([[nepheline]] or [[leucite]]), [[plagioclase]], and [[augite]], together with [[olivine]] and lesser iron-titanium oxides such as [[ilmenite]] and [[magnetite]]-[[ulvospinel]]; minor alkali [[feldspar]] may be present, as illustrated by the position of the field for basanite in the [[QAPF diagram]]. [[Clinopyroxene]] ([[augite]]) and [[olivine]] are common as phenocrysts and in the matrix. The augite contains significantly greater titanium, aluminium and sodium than that in typical [[Tholeiite|tholeiitic basalt]]. [[Quartz]] is absent, as are [[orthopyroxene]] and [[pigeonite]]. Chemically basanites are low in silica (42 to 45% SiO<sub>2</sub>) and high in alkalis (3 to 5.5% Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O) compared to basalt, which typically contains more SiO<sub>2</sub>, as evident on the diagram used for [[TAS classification]]. [[Nephelinite]] is yet richer in Na<sub>2</sub>O plus K<sub>2</sub>O compared to SiO<sub>2</sub>.

Basanites occur both on continents and on ocean islands. For example, together with basalts, they are produced by [[hotspot]] volcanism in the Hawaiian and the Comores Islands. (e.g.,[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003AM/finalprogram/abstract_65599.htm])

Basanite is also used to refer to a black flinty [[jasper]] found in several New England states of the U. S. A. It is also informally known as lydite and touchstone. It has been used to test for the purity of precious metal alloys.
