'''Sheffield, Brightside''' was a [[Borough constituency|parliamentary constituency]] in the [[Sheffield|City of Sheffield]]. Created for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], and replaced at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] by the new constituency of [[Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough]], it elected one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], using the [[first-past-the-post]] voting system.

In its first fifty years, Brightside returned a variety of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs. However, from 1945 onwards, it became one of the Labour Party's [[safe seat|safest seats]] in the United Kingdom. It was represented by [[David Blunkett]] from 1987 until its abolition.

==Boundaries==
Sheffield Brightside covers the north of the city and includes the wards of [[Firth Park (ward)|Firth Park]], [[Shiregreen and Brightside]], and [[Southey]], it also includes the northern part of [[Burngreave (ward)|Burngreave]] ward and small parts of [[Hillsborough, South Yorkshire|Hillsborough]] and [[Walkley (ward)|Walkley]] wards. It borders the constituencies of [[Rotherham (UK Parliament constituency)|Rotherham]], [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]], [[Sheffield Heeley (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Heeley]] and [[Sheffield Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hillsborough]].

===Boundary review===
Following their review of parliamentary representation in [[South Yorkshire]], the [[Boundary Commission for England]] recommended that Sheffield Brightside should gain all of Burngreave and Hillsborough wards, with Walkley moving to Sheffield Central, and that the constituency be renamed Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough.

The electoral wards in the newly shaped constituency are entirely within the city of Sheffield.
*Burngreave, Firth Park, Hillsborough, Shiregreen and Brightside, and Southey

==History==
Sheffield Brightside was created in 1885 when the former [[Sheffield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield constituency]] was split into five constituencies.
