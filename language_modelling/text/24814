The '''Indian Pacific''' is a passenger [[Rail transport|rail]] service running between [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was started in [[1970]] after the railway line between Sydney and Perth had all been converted to [[standard gauge]]. It covers 4352 [[kilometres]], passes through three states and travels along one of the world's longest straight stretches of railway track. The journey takes 65 hours.

== Route ==
[[Image:Indian pacific map.gif|thumb|left|Route (white)]]
The route leaves [[East Perth railway station|East Perth Station]] and travels east to [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]]. This section was built as [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]], and even when it was converted to standard gauge in [[1968]] there was a change of [[locomotive]]s and train crew at Kalgoorlie, from [[Westrail]] to [[Australian National Railways]]. 

From there it continues east across the [[Nullarbor Plain]] on the [[Trans-Australian Railway]] to [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]]. This railway was built as standard gauge, completed in [[1917]] as part of the promises made to [[Western Australia]] on federation in [[1901]]. The section included the longest stretch of straight railway track in the world at that time (478 km) around [[Cook, South Australia|Cook]]. When it was built, there was a [[break-of-gauge]] at both ends.

The train continues south to [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]], then inland to [[Crystal Brook, South Australia|Crystal Brook]], and south to [[Adelaide]], the capital of [[South Australia]]. It returns along the same track to Crystal Brook, then turns east again towards [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], passing through the historic triple-gauge railway towns of [[Gladstone, South Australia|Gladstone]] and [[Peterborough, South Australia|Peterborough]]. Port Pirie to Broken Hill was rebuilt to standard gauge in [[1970]] (previously narrow gauge), and the Crystal Brook to Adelaide section was built in [[1982]]. Prior to that the Indian Pacific did not go down to Adelaide, passengers transferring at Port Pirie from a broad-gauge Adelaide train.

From Broken Hill, the train continues across [[New South Wales]] to [[Parkes, New South Wales|Parkes]], then climbs over the [[Blue Mountains]] and into Sydney. It terminates at platform 1, 2 or 3 at [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]] depending on the length of the train.

In 2005, the train spends about three hours at Broken Hill, Adelaide and Kalgoorlie, and about one hour at Cook. During this time passengers may look around, and there are optional tours available in Broken Hill, Adelaide and Kalgoorlie.

==Passenger facilities==

Great Southern Railway has branded its services as Gold Kangaroo and Red Kangaroo. The former, a first-class service, features a choice of Roomette or Twinette sleeper cabins, with complimentary [[table d'h<U+00F4>te]] meals in the [[Restaurant#Dining car|restaurant car]]. Drinks are available for purchase in the lounge car. 

Red Kangaroo service, the equivalent of economy class, features a choice of airline-style seats (referred to as "sit-ups") in the coach cars or dual-berth shared sleeper cabins. It offers a buffet-restaurant car and a lounge bar.

The train also carries passengers' motor vehicles.

==Christmas train==
[[Image:Indian Pacific in Cook, South Australia.jpg|thumb|200px|The Indian Pacific at [[Cook, South Australia]]]]
In recent years, the Indian Pacific has operated a Christmas Train with a notable music personality onboard. 

The train stops at several locations to entertain the locals and thank them for their support of the train. 

The locations include the remote [[Nullarbor Plain|Nullarbor]] sidings of [[Watson, South Australia|Watson]], [[Cook, South Australia|Cook]], and [[Rawlinna, Western Australia|Rawlinna]]. 

Some of the performers onboard have been [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]] (2006), [[Guy Sebastian]] (2005), [[Jimmy Barnes]] (2004), [[John Paul Young]] (2003), [[Alex Collins]] (2007), [[Marcia Hines]] (2002), [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (2001) and [[Nikki Webster]] (2000).

==Incidents==
On [[24 December]] [[1975]] 14 of the 25 carriages on the eastbound train derailed due to a collapsed [[bogie]] on the leading carriage, between the remote [[Nullarbor Plain|Nullarbor]] sidings of Haig and Nurina. Three of the 200 passengers were injured, and they were flown from [[Forrest, Western Australia|Forrest]] to [[Adelaide]]. [http://www.arhsnsw.com.au/images/imdigest/im0512/0512retro.pdf] 

On [[18 August]] [[1999]] the westbound train was accidentally directed into a [[crossing loop]] occupied by an eastbound train at [[Zanthus, Western Australia|Zanthus]]. ''Further information: [[Zanthus train collision]]''.

On [[3 December]] [[1999]] a Cityrail interurban train ran into the back of the eastbound train at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. Seven people died, all on the Cityrail train.
