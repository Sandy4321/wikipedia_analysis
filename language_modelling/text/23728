The '''Battle of Marj Rahit''' ({{lang-ar|''Yawm Mardj R<U+0101>hi<U+1E6D>''}}) was one of the early battles of the [[Second Islamic Civil War]]. It was fought on 18 August 684 between the armies of the [[Banu Kalb]] tribal group, supporting the [[Umayyads]] under Caliph [[Marwan I]], and the [[Banu Qays]] under [[al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri]], who supported [[Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr]], who had proclaimed himself Caliph at [[Mecca]]. The Kalbi victory consolidated the position of the Umayyads, under Marwan I, over [[al-Sham|Syria]], paving the way for their eventual victory in the civil war against Ibn al-Zubayr. However, it also left a bitter legacy of division and rivalry between the Qaysis and the Kalbis, which would contribute to much strife and instability for the remainder of the Umayyad Caliphate.

== Background ==
At the death of [[Mu'awiya I]] (r. 661<U+2013>680), the founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], in 680, the Muslim world was thrown into turmoil. Although Mu'awiya had named his son, [[Yazid I]], as his heir, this choice was not universally recognized, especially by the old [[Medina]]n elites, who challenged the Umayyads' claim to the succession. Among them, the two chief candidates for the caliphate were the [[Alid]] [[Husayn ibn Ali]], and [[Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr]].<ref>Hawting (2000), p. 46</ref> Husayn at first attempted an outright revolt against the Umayyads, but this resulted in his death at the [[Battle of Karbala]] in October 680,<ref>Hawting (2000), pp. 49<U+2013>51</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), p. 89</ref> leaving Ibn al-Zubayr as the leading contender. As long as Yazid lived, Ibn al-Zubayr denounced his rule from the sanctuary of [[Mecca]] but did not openly claim the Caliphate, instead insisting that the Caliph should be chosen in the traditional manner, by a tribal assembly (''shura'') from among all the [[Quraysh]]. After the open revolt of Medina against Umayyad rule, in 683 Yazid sent an army to Arabia that [[Battle of al-Harrah|defeated]] the Medinans and even [[Siege of Mecca (683)|laid siege]] to Mecca, but Yazid's death in November forced the expeditionary force to return home.<ref>Hawting (2000), pp. 47<U+2013>48</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>

Yazid was succeeded by his son, [[Mu'awiya II]], but he died a few weeks later and never enjoyed any real authority outside the family's traditional stronghold of [[al-Sham|Syria]]. His death provoked a crisis, since his other brothers were too young to succeed.<ref>Hawting (2000), p. 47</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), p. 90</ref> As a result, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and Ibn al-Zubayr was accepted by most of the Muslims as their new leader: the Umayyad governor of [[Iraq]], [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]], was evicted from the province, which passed to Ibn al-Zubayr's brother [[Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr|Mus'ab]] became governor of [[Iraq]], coins in his name were minted in [[Persia]], and even the [[Banu Qays]] of northern Syria went over to his cause. Even some members of the Umayyad family considered going to Mecca and declare their allegiance to him.<ref>Hawting (2000), p. 48</ref><ref>Kennedy (2004), pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref> In central and southern Syria, however, the Umayyad cause was upheld by the local tribes, led by the [[Banu Kalb]] under Ibn Bahdal and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. At their initiative, a ''shura'' of the loyal tribes was held at [[Jabiya]], where [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hakam]], a cousin of Mu'awiya I who had served under the Caliph [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (r. 644<U+2013>656) but played no role in Mu'awiya's Umayyad regime, was elected as the Umayyads' caliphal candidate.<ref>Hawting (2000), pp. 53<U+2013>54</ref><ref name="Kennedy91">Kennedy (2004), p. 91</ref>

== Opening skirmishes and the battle of Marj Rahit ==
Marwan's election provoked the reaction of the Qays, who rallied around the governor of [[Damascus]], [[al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri]]. After vacillating between the two candidates, al-Dahhak was persuaded to recognize Ibn al-Zubayr, and began assembling his forces on the field of Marj al-Suffar near Damascus. In response, the Umayyad coalition marched on Damascus, which was surrendered to the Umayyads by the [[Ghassanid]] tribe.<ref name="Kennedy91"/><ref>Eliss<U+00E9>eff (1991), pp. 544<U+2013>545</ref> 

The two armies first clashed in mid-July 684 at Marj al-Suffar, and the Qays were pushed south of Damascus at Marj Rahit. Twenty days of skirmishing between the two camps followed, until the final battle took place on 18 August.<ref name="EI2">Eliss<U+00E9>eff (1991), p. 545</ref> The numbers of the two opponents are uncertain: [[al-Tabari]] puts Marwan's forces at 6,000, another tradition at 13,000 and 30,000 for Marwan and al-Dahhak respectively, while [[Ibn Khayyat]] inflates the numbers to 30,000 and 60,000 respectively.<ref name="EI2"/><ref>Kennedy (2001), p. 54 (n. 89)</ref> The traditions agree, however, that the Umayyad forces were considerably outnumbered.<ref name="Kennedy91"/> Marwan's commanders were Abbas ibn Ziyad, Amr ibn Sa'id al-As and Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad (another tradition has Ubayd Allah commanding the cavalry and Malik ibn Hubayra al-Skauni the infantry), while only one of al-Dahhak's commanders, Ziyad ibn Amr ibn Mu'awiya al-Uqayli, is known.<ref>Hawting (1989), pp. 59, 62</ref><ref>Kennedy (2001), pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref>

A plethora of anecdotes, individual accounts and poems on the battle survives,<ref>cf. Hawting (1989), pp. 54<U+2013>69</ref> but the details of the battle itself are not clear, except that the day resulted in a crushing Umayyad victory: the main leaders of the Qays, including al-Dahhak, fell in the field. N. Eliss<U+00E9>eff explains the Umayyad success by the possible defection of Qays-aligned tribes during the preceding weeks, eager to uphold the Syrian hegemony over the Caliphate. In addition,  Eliss<U+00E9>eff points out that the Umayyads still controlled the state treasury in Damascus, allowing them to bribe tribes to join them.<ref name="EI2"/> The remnants of the Qays army fled to [[Qarqisiya]] under Zufar ibn Harith al-Kilabi, and Marwan was officially proclaimed as Caliph at Damascus.<ref name="Kennedy91"/>

== Aftermath ==
The victory at Marj Rahit secured the Umayyads' position in Syria, and allowed them to go into the offensive against Ibn al-Zubayr's supporters. Egypt was recovered later in the year, but an attempt to recover Iraq under Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad was defeated by pro-Alid forces under [[al-Mukhtar]] near [[Mosul]] in August 686.  [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]], who had succeeded his father Marwan I after the latter's death in April 685, thereafter restricted himself to securing his own position. In 691, he managed to bring Zufar al-Kilabi's Qays back into the Umayyad fold, and advanced into the Iraq. Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr was [[Battle of Maskin|defeated and killed]], and Umayyad authority re-established. In October 682, after another [[siege of Mecca (692)|siege]] of Mecca, Abdallah ibn al-Zubayr was killed, and the civil war ended.<ref>Kennedy (2001), pp. 92<U+2013>98</ref>

== Impact ==
The most long-term legacy of Marj Rahit was in the consolidation of the Qays-Kalb split in Syria, which was paralleled in the division and rivalry between the [[Mudar]], led by the [[Banu Tamim]], and the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]] and [[Azd]] alliance in Iraq. Together, these rivalries caused a realignment of tribal loyalties in two tribal "super-groups" across the Caliphate: the "North Arab" or Qays/Mudaris, opposed by the "South Arab" or Yemenis. These terms were political rather than strictly geographical, since the properly "northern" Rabi'a adhered to the "southern" Yemenis.<ref>Hawting (2000), pp. 54<U+2013>55</ref><ref>Kennedy (2001), p. 105</ref> Although the Umayyad caliphs tried to balance the two groups, this division and the implacable rivalry between the two groups became a fixture of the Arab world over the next decades. Even unaligned tribes were drawn to affiliate themselves with one of the two super-groups, and their constant contest for power and influence dominated the Umayyad Caliphate, creating instability in the provinces, helping usher the disastrous [[Third Islamic Civil War]] and contributing to the Umayyads' final fall at the hands of the [[Abbasids]].<ref>Kennedy (2001), pp. 99<U+2013>115</ref> The division continued long after: as [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] writes, "As late as the nineteenth century, battles were still being fought in Palestine between groups calling themselves Qays and Yaman".<ref>Kennedy (2001), p. 92</ref>
