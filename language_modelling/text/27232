'''Michael Stroukoff''' was a Russian-born [[aircraft designer]], who served in the [[White Army]] before emigrating to the [[United States]]. After spending some time as an [[architect]], he joined the [[Chase Aircraft Company]] and designed a number of transport aircraft for the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and the [[United States Air Force]], later starting his own company to perform further [[aeronautical]] work.

==Early life==
Born 29 January 1883 in [[Yekaterinoslav]] ([[Dnipropetrovsk]]), a city in the [[Russian Empire]] (now part of [[Ukraine]]), Stroukoff attended the [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute]], graduating in 1908<ref name="BS">Sergievsky et. al. 1998, p.128</ref> with a degree in civic engineering.<ref name="Soaring">"In Memoriam" ''Soaring''. Volume 38, 1974. p.13.</ref> Joining the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian Army]], he saw service during [[World War I]], then after the war he served in the [[White Army]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], attaining the rank of Major and being awarded the [[Order of St. George|Order of St. George of the Fourth Degree]].<ref name="1000p">Visschedijk 2009</ref> With the defeat of the Whites by the [[Bolshevik]]s, he fled Russia and emigrated to the United States in 1922.<ref name="Soaring"/><ref name="PS">Compere 1952, p.128.</ref>

==American career==
[[Image:Stroukoff YC-134A - NASA.jpg|thumb|right|Stroukoff Aircraft YC-134A]]
Following his emigration, Stroukoff started a career in [[architecture]] and [[interior design]],<ref name="1000p"/> before being appointed chief engineer and president of [[Chase Aircraft]] upon its foundation.<ref name="DP"/> His first design was the [[Chase CG-14|XCG-14]], a wooden troop-carrying [[assault glider]], which was developed into the larger [[Chase CG-18|CG-18]] and [[Chase XCG-20|CG-20]] gliders, the latter being the largest glider ever constructed in the United States.<ref name="BS"/><ref name="DP">Pattillo 2000, pp.165-166.</ref>

Following World War II, the assault glider fell out of favour, replaced by powered transports, and Stroukoff modified a YG-18 into the prototype [[Chase YC-122|YC-122]], and a small number of the aircraft were built.<ref name="DP"/> More important was the conversion of the G-20 into the [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123]], described as a "Winged Truck" by Stroukoff.<ref name="PS"/> While one version of the aircraft was the first [[turbojet|jet-powered]]  transport built in America,<ref name="DP"/> it was the piston-engined 'assault transport' version of the C-123 that won a contract from the [[United States Air Force]] for production; due to limited capacity at Chase, this was subcontracted to the [[Henry J. Kaiser|Kaiser Manufacturing Company]], which purchased a 49% interest in Chase Aircraft.<ref name="DP"/> However, following a procurement scandal and political issues,<ref>Gunston 1977, p.164</ref> the C-123 contract was awarded to [[Fairchild Aircraft]], and Kaiser bought out Chase Aircraft.<ref name="DP"/>

Setting up a new company, the [[Stroukoff Aircraft Corporation]], Stroukoff continued work on improved versions of the C-123, most notably the [[Stroukoff YC-134|YC-134]], however none of them would go into production, and in 1959 the company closed down.<ref name="DP"/>

==Death and legacy==
Stroukoff died at the age of 90 in [[St. Francis Hospital]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] on December 22, 1973.<ref name="Soaring"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Michael Stroukoff Dead; Aircraft Designer Was 90 |first= |last= |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20F15FF3E59127A93C6AB1789D95F478785F9 |format=fee required |newspaper=The New York Times |publisher= |date=23 December 1973 |page= |accessdate=2010-11-26}}</ref>

The Larissa Stroukoff Memorial Trophy, awarded by the [[Soaring Society of America]] for the highest speed recorded on a closed course in a [[glider (aircraft)|glider]] during the [[U.S. National Open Class Soaring Championships]], was designed by Stroukoff.<ref>''[http://www.ssa.org/myhome.asp?mbr=7262842059&show=blog&id=812#Stroukoff SSA Awards and SSA Recognized Awards: The Larissa Stroukoff Memorial Trophy]'', Soaring Society of America.

<!-- In 1996, the [[Russian Academy of Science]] named Stroukoff, [[Alexander de Seversky]] and [[Igor Sikorsky]] as the three most important Russian [[emigr<U+00E9>]] aircraft designers who contributed to the development of aviation in the [[United States]].{{cn}} -->
