'''Joshua Abraham Norton''' (''c.'' 1819<ref>There are a number of disputed claims regarding Norton's date of birth. Many sources (Cowan, Norton's tombstone, and most present-day books on Norton) pinpoint Norton being born sometime in 1819, while a few sources state that he was born on February 4, 1819. Norton's obituary by the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' put him at 65 years old at the time of his death, which would mean he was born sometime <!--in?--> 1814.

Born in [[London]], Norton spent most of his early life in [[South Africa]]. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1849 after receiving a [[bequest]] of $40,000 from his father's estate. Norton initially made a living as a [[businessman]], but he lost his fortune investing in [[Peru]]vian [[rice]].<ref name="Carr">{{cite journal|last=Carr|first= Patricia E.|month=July|year=1975|title=Emperor Norton I: The benevolent dictator beloved and honored by San Franciscans to this day |journal=American History Illustrated|volume=10|issue=|pages=14<U+2013>20|url=http://www.molossia.org/norton.html}}</ref>

After losing a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton left San Francisco.

==Early life==
Norton was born in [[England]], but scholarly works disagree as to the date and exact town of his birth. His obituary in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "following the best information obtainable", cited the [[silver]] plate on his coffin which said he was "aged about 65",<ref name="Mort2">{{cite news|title=Le Roi Est Mort|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1880-01-11|url= http://www.zpub.com/sf/history/nort3.html|accessdate=2006-09-19}}</ref> suggesting that 1814 could be the year of his birth. Other sources claim that he was born on February 4, 1819 in [[London]].<ref name="Cowan">{{cite journal|last=Cowan|first=Robert|title= Norton I Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico (Joshua A.

Norton emigrated from South Africa to [[San Francisco]] in 1849 after receiving a bequest of $40,000 from his father's estate.<ref name="SFMHS"/> He enjoyed a good deal of success in the real estate market and by the early 1850s had accumulated a fortune of $250,000.<ref name="SFMHS"/><ref name="Cowan"/> Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when [[China]], facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of [[rice]], causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four cents per pound to thirty-six cents per pound (9 cents/kg to 79 cents/kg).<ref name="SFMHS"/> When he heard that the ''Glyde'', which was returning from [[Peru]], was carrying {{convert|200000|lb}} of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.<ref name="SFMHS"/>

Shortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound.<ref name="SFMHS"/> Norton tried to void the contract, stating that the dealer had misled him as to the quality of rice to expect.<ref name="SFMHS"/> From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the [[Supreme Court of California]], which ruled against Norton.<ref>''Ruiz v. Norton'', 4 Cal. 355 (1854).</ref> Later on, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt.<ref name="SFMHS"/> Norton's mental state was severely affected by these financial setbacks. He declared [[bankruptcy]] in 1858 and left the city for a time. There are no known documents noting that Norton had an eccentric personality prior to the loss of his fortune, so it is not known whether his pronounced eccentricity was a permanent aspect of his character or arose as a result of the stressful financial straits he found himself in during the 1850s. Nonetheless, after his sudden loss of financial stability, Norton became (in the absence of a proper diagnosis) somewhat "odd", exhibiting the symptoms often referred to as "[[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]]".<ref name="SH"/>

==Declares himself "Emperor"==
[[Image:Emperor Joshua A. Norton I.jpg|thumb|Norton in full regalia]]

When Norton returned to San Francisco from his self-imposed [[exile]], he had become completely disgruntled with what he considered the vicissitudes and inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself "Emperor of these United States":

{{cquote|At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S. F., Cal., declare and proclaim myself Emperor of these U. S.; and in virtue of the authority thereby in me vested, do hereby order and direct the representatives of the different States of the Union to assemble in Musical Hall, of this city, on the 1st day of Feb. next, then and there to make such alterations in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate the evils under which the country is laboring, and thereby cause confidence to exist, both at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.
<br />

Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical twenty-one-year "reign" over America.

[[Image:Emperor Norton proclamation re. assumption of prerogatives WFHM SF.JPG|thumb|One of Norton's undated [[proclamation]]s]]

In accordance with his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree that formally "dissolved" the [[United States Congress]]. In the decree, Norton observed:

{{cquote|...fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled.<ref>{{cite web|title=He abolishes Congress|publisher=|first=Joel|last= Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/nocongress.html|accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>}}

As a result, Norton ordered that all interested parties gather at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 so as to "remedy the evil complained of".<ref name="Decrees">{{cite web|title=The Proclamations of Norton I|publisher=|first=Joel |last=Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/proclaim.html|accessdate=2007-04-25}}</ref>

In another imperial decree a month later, Norton summoned the army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:

{{cquote|WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished;
<br />
WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with;
<br />
NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct [[Winfield Scott|Major-General Scott]], the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress.<ref>{{cite web| title=He calls on the Army|publisher=|first=Joel|last=Gazis-Sax|year=1998|url=http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/bringdaarmy.html| accessdate=2007-04-24}}</ref>}}

Norton's orders obviously had no effect on the Army, and the Congress likewise continued in its activities unperturbed. Norton issued further decrees in 1860 that purported to dissolve the republic and to forbid the assembly of any members of the Congress.<ref name="Decrees"/> Norton's battle against the elected leaders of America was to persist throughout what he considered his reign, though it appears that Norton eventually, if somewhat grudgingly, accepted that Congress would continue to exist without his permission, although this did not change his feelings on the matter. In the hopes of resolving the many disputes between citizens of the United States during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Norton issued a mandate in 1862 ordering both the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches to publicly ordain him as "Emperor".<ref name="Cowan"/>

His attempts to overthrow the elected government of America by force having been utterly ignored, Norton turned his attention and his proclamations to other matters, both political and social. On August 12, 1869, "being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm", he abolished both the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] parties.<ref name="SFMuseumNorton"/> The failure to refer to Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect was the subject of a particularly stern edict in 1872:

{{cquote|Whoever after due and proper warning shall be heard to utter the abominable word "Frisco", which has no linguistic or other warrant, shall be deemed guilty of a High Misdemeanor, and shall pay into the Imperial Treasury as penalty the sum of twenty-five dollars.<ref>{{cite web| title = He Bans the F-Word| publisher = | author =Joel Gazis-Sax | year =1998 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/notfrisco.html| accessdate = 2007-04-24 }}</ref>}}

For all of his quirks and regardless of the precise nature of his psychological condition, Norton was on some occasions a visionary, and a number of his "Imperial Decrees" exhibited a profound foresight. Among his many edicts were instructions to form a [[League of Nations]],<ref>{{cite book | last=Mencken | first=Henry Louis| coauthors=George Jean Nathan |title=The American Mercury | publisher= | location=| year = 1951|isbn= | page=499|authorlink4=[[H. L. Mencken]]}}</ref> and he explicitly forbade any form of discord or conflict between religions or their sects. Norton also saw fit on a number of occasions to decree the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and San Francisco, his later decrees becoming increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience being exhibited by the authorities:

{{cquote|WHEREAS, we issued our decree ordering the citizens of San Francisco and Oakland to appropriate funds for the survey of a suspension bridge from Oakland Point via [[Yerba Buena Island|Goat Island]]; also for a tunnel; and to ascertain which is the best project; and whereas the said citizens have hitherto neglected to notice our said decree; and whereas we are determined our authority shall be fully respected; now, therefore, we do hereby command the arrest by the army of both the Boards of City Fathers if they persist in neglecting our decrees.
<br />
Given under our royal hand and seal at San Francisco, this 17th day of September, 1872.<ref name="SH"/>}}

This suggestion, unlike many of Norton's others, actually came to fruition, but not because of him; construction of the [[San Francisco&nbsp;<U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge]] began on July 9, 1933 and was completed on November 12, 1936.<ref>{{cite book | last=Dannhausen | first=William O. | title=Better Roads | publisher= | location=| year = 1931|isbn= | page=58 }}</ref> The construction of [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]]'s [[Transbay Tube]] was completed in 1969, with Transbay rail service commencing in 1974.<ref>{{cite web| title = BART&nbsp;<U+2014> History and Facts, System Facts| publisher = [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] District (BART)| author = | date = | url = http://bart.gov/about/history/systemFacts.asp| accessdate = 2007-04-18 }}</ref>

==Eccentric "Imperial" behavior==

Norton spent his days as emperor inspecting the streets of San Francisco in an elaborate blue [[uniform]] with gold-plated epaulets, given to him by officers of the United States Army post at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. He also wore a [[beaver hat]] decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette.<ref>{{cite web| title = Two Bay Area Bridges&nbsp;<U+2014> The Golden Gate and San Francisco&nbsp;<U+2013> Oakland Bay Bridge| publisher =[[Federal Highway Administration]]| author = | date =2005-01-18 | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/2bridges.htm| accessdate = 2007-06-08 }}</ref> He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or an umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and [[cable car (railway)|cable cars]], the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers.<ref name="p153">{{cite book | last=Moran | first=Mark |coauthors=Mark Sceurman| title=Weird U.S.: Your Travel Guide To America's Local Legends And Best Kept Secrets | publisher= Sterling Publishing| location=New York| year = 2005|isbn=0-7607-5043-2| page=153}}</ref> Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot at the time.

It was during one of his inspections that Norton is reputed to have performed one of his most famous acts of "diplomacy." During the 1860s and 1870s, there were a number of anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco. Ugly riots, some resulting in fatalities, broke out on several occasions. During one such incident, Norton allegedly positioned himself between the rioters and their Chinese targets, and with a bowed head started reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without incident.<ref name="p153"/>

Norton was much loved and revered by the citizens of San Francisco. Although penniless, he regularly ate at the finest restaurants in San Francisco; these restaurateurs then took it upon themselves to add brass plaques in their entrances declaring "[b]y Appointment to his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Norton I of the United States."<ref>{{cite book | last=Sinclair | first=Mick |coauthors=| title=San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History | publisher= Signal Books| location=Oxford, England| year = 2004|isbn=1-902669-65-7| page=20}}</ref> By all accounts, such "Imperial seals of approval" were much prized and a substantial boost to trade. Supposedly, no play or musical performance in San Francisco would dare to open without reserving balcony seats for Norton.<ref name="SFMHS"/>

A popular rumor started by the devoted Norton caricaturist [[Edward Jump|Ed Jump]] holds that he had two dogs, [[Bummer and Lazarus]], who were themselves notable San Francisco celebrities at the time.<ref name="BL">{{cite web| title = Bummer and Lazarus| publisher =Encyclopedia of San Francisco| author =Malcolm E. Barker | date = | url = http://www.sfhistoryencyclopedia.com/articles/b/bummerLazarus.html| accessdate = 2007-06-08 }}</ref> Although he did not own the dogs, Norton ate at free lunch counters where he provided the dogs with a few morsels of food.<ref name="Carr"/>

[[Image:Nort10d.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A ten dollar note issued by the Imperial Government of Norton I]]

In 1867, a police officer named Armand Barbier [[arrest]]ed Norton for the purpose of committing him to involuntary treatment for a [[mental disorder]].<ref name="BBC"/> The arrest outraged the citizens of San Francisco and sparked a number of scathing [[editorials]] in the newspapers. Police Chief Patrick Crowley speedily rectified matters by ordering Norton released and issuing a formal apology on behalf of the police force.<ref name="SFMHS"/> Chief Crowley observed of the self-styled monarch "that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows in that line."<ref name="Cowan"/> Norton was magnanimous enough to grant an "Imperial Pardon" to the errant young police officer. Possibly as a result of this scandal, all police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted Norton as he passed in the street.<ref name="p153"/>

Norton did receive some small tokens of formal recognition for his self-claimed position: the 1870 U.S. [[census]] records Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street; his occupation is given as "Emporer"{{Sic}}.<ref name="SFMuseumNorton"/><ref>[http://www.rootsweb.com/~cenfiles/ca/sanfrancisco/1870/ed41/sanfrancisco/ward03/sanfrancisco-c07.txt Transcription of census records page]</ref> Norton would also issue his own money on occasion in order to pay for certain debts, and this became an accepted [[local currency]] in San Francisco. Typically these notes came in denominations ranging anywhere from fifty cents to ten dollars; the few notes still extant are collector's items. The city of San Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, with a great deal of ceremony, bought him a suitably regal replacement. In return, Norton sent them a gracious note of thanks and issued a "[[Letters patent|patent]] of nobility in perpetuity" for each supervisor.<ref>{{cite book | last=Gorman | first=Michael R. |coauthors=| title=The Empress Is a Man: Stories from the Life of Jose Sarria| publisher= The Haworth Press, Inc.| location=Binghamton, New York| year = 1998|isbn=0-7890-0259-0| page=8}}</ref>

==Later years and death==
During the later years of Norton's "reign", he was the subject of considerable rumor and speculation. One popular story suggested that he was the son of Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]] and that his claim of coming from [[South Africa]] was a ruse to prevent persecution.<ref name="Mort2"/><ref>To have been an illegitimate son of [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]], he would have had to have been conceived when the French Emperor was only eleven; Louis Napoleon's actual son, [[Napol<U+00E9>on Eug<U+00E8>ne, Prince Imperial]], died fighting in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] in 1879.</ref> Another popular story suggested that Norton was planning to marry the already married [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref name="BBC"/> While this claim is unsupported, Norton did write to the Queen on several occasions and he is reported to have met Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]].<ref name="Cowan"/> Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy<U+2014>only affecting poverty because he was miserly.

A number of decrees that were probably fraudulent were submitted and duly printed in local newspapers, and it is believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas.<ref name="SFMHS"/><!--for example?--> The [[Museum of the City of San Francisco]] maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.<ref name="SFMuseumNorton"/>

On the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front of [[Old Saint Mary's Cathedral|Old St. Mary's Church]] while on his way to a lecture at the [[California Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=<ref name="SFMHS"/> His collapse was immediately noticed and "the police officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital."<ref name="Mort">{{cite news| title = Le Roi Est Mort | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |author = | date =January 9, 1880 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/nobit.html| accessdate = 2006-09-19 }}</ref> Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The following day the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' published his obituary on its front page under the headline "Le Roi est Mort" (''"The King is Dead"'').<ref name="Mort"/> In a tone tinged with sadness, the article respectfully reported that, "[o]n the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moon-less night under the dripping rain..., Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life".<ref name="Mort"/> The ''Morning Call'', another leading San Francisco newspaper, published a front-page article using an almost identical sentence as a headline: "Norton the First, by the grace of God Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life."<ref name="SFMuseumNorton"/>

It quickly became evident that, contrary to the rumors, Norton had died in complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single sovereign, worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of hats (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; and a handful of the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest.<ref name="SFMHS"/><ref name="Death">{{cite web| title = The Madness of Joshua Norton| publisher = | author =Joel Gazis-Sax | year =1997 | url = http://www.notfrisco.com/colmatales/norton/norton2.html| accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}</ref> There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia]], congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and 98 shares of stock in a defunct [[gold mine]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Asbury | first=Herbert| title=The Barbary Coast| publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press | location=New York| year = 2002|isbn=1-56025-408-4 | page=231|authorlink4=Herbert Asbury }}</ref>

Initial funeral arrangements included a pauper's [[coffin]] of simple [[coast redwood|redwood]]. However, members of the Pacific Club (a San Franciscan businessman's association) established a funeral fund that paid for a handsome [[rosewood]] [[casket]] and arranged a suitably dignified farewell.<ref name="Cowan"/> Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10, was a solemn, mournful, and large affair. Respects were paid "...by all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast."<ref name="Mort2"/> Some accounts report that as many as 30,000 people lined the streets to pay homage, and that the funeral cortege was two miles (3&nbsp;km) long. At the time San Francisco's total population was a mere 230,000.<ref>http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-13.pdf</ref> He was buried at the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Cemetery, at the expense of the City of San Francisco.<ref name="SFMHS"/>

In 1934, Norton's remains were transferred, as were all graves in the city, at the expense of the City of San Francisco to a grave site of moderate splendor at Woodlawn Cemetery, in [[Colma, California|Colma]]. The site is marked by a large stone inscribed "Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico".<ref>Photos of gravestone at [http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=766 Findagrave.com]</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Emperor Reburied | author = | date = July 9, 1934| publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,769908-1,00.html| accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}</ref>

Although details of Norton's life story may have been forgotten, he was immortalized in literature. [[Mark Twain]], who was resident in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's "reign", modeled the character of the King in ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' after Norton.<ref name="SFMHS"/>

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] made Norton a character in his 1892 novel, ''The Wrecker''. Stevenson's stepdaughter, Isobel Field, wrote about Norton in her autobiography entitled ''This Life I've Loved''. She wrote that Norton "was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.'
