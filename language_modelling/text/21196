The '''Christianisation of Scotland''' was the process by which Christianity spread in what is now Scotland, which took place principally between the fifth and tenth centuries. Christianity was probably introduced to what is now [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scotland]] by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the [[Britons (historical)|British]] enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the [[pagan]] [[Anglo-Saxons]] advanced. 

Traditional narratives depict Scotland as largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as [[St Columba]], from the fifth to the seventh centuries, but many of these figures were later constructs or founded monasteries and collegiate churches in areas where Christianity had already taken root. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of [[Celtic Christianity]], in which [[abbot]]s were more significant than [[bishop]]s, attitudes to [[clerical celibacy]] were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Christianity]], particularly the form of [[tonsure]] and the method of [[Computus|calculating Easter]], although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the reconversion of [[Scandinavian Scotland]] in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom. The process of Christianisation was also significant in the development of Scottish national identity, the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]] to the Continent, the development of [[Insular art]] and in the introduction of Latin and formal education. 

==Background==
===Pre-Christian religion===
{{Main|Celtic polytheism}}
Very little is known about religion in Scotland before the arrival of Christianity. The lack of native written sources among the Picts means that it can only be judged from parallels elsewhere, occasional surviving archaeological evidence and hostile accounts of later Christian writers. It is generally presumed to have resembled [[Celtic polytheism]]. The names of more than two hundred Celtic deities have been noted, some of which, like [[Lugh]], [[The Dagda]] and [[The Morrigan]], come from later Irish mythology, whilst others, like [[Teutatis]], [[Taranis]] and [[Cernunnos]], come from evidence from [[Gaul]].<ref>B. Cunliffe, ''The Ancient Celts'' (Oxford, 1997), ISBN 0-14-025422-6, p. 184.</ref> The Celtic pagans constructed temples and shrines to venerate these gods, something they did through [[votive offerings]] and performing sacrifices, possibly including [[human sacrifice]]. According to Greek and Roman accounts, in Gaul, Britain and Ireland, there was a priestly caste of "magico-religious specialists" known as the [[druids]], although very little is definitely known about them.<ref>R. Hutton, ''Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain'' (Yale University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-300-14485-7, p. 17.</ref> Irish legends about the origin of the Picts and stories from the life of [[Saint Ninian|St. Ninian]], associate the Picts with druids. The Picts are also associated with "demon" worship and one story concerning [[St. Columba]] has him exorcising a demon from a well in Pictland, suggesting that the worship of well spirits was a feature of Pictish paganism. Roman mentions of the worship of the Goddess [[Minerva]] at wells and a Pictish stone associated with a well near [[Dunvegan Castle]] on Skye have been taken to support this case.<ref>P. Dunbavin, ''Picts and ancient Britons: an Exploration of Pictish Origins'' (Third Millennium Publishing, 1998), ISBN 0-9525029-1-7, p. 41.</ref>

===Roman influence===

The roots of Christianity in Scotland can probably be found among the soldiers and ordinary Roman citizens in the vicinity of [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref>L. Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550&ndash;850'' (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland), ISBN 0-903903-24-5, p. 63.</ref> The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of [[Britannia]] were among the most Christianised in the island.<ref>Lucas Quensel von Kalben, "The British Church and the Emergence of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom", in T.

While British Christians continued to practice [[inhumation]] without grave goods, the pagan [[Anglo-Saxons]] are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife.<ref>N. Brooks, ''Anglo-Saxon Myths: State and Church, 400-1066'' (London: Continuum, 2000), ISBN 1-85285-154-6, p. 23.</ref> However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at [[Dalmeny]] in East Lothian.<ref>L.

===Post-Roman kingdoms===
{{See also|Scotland in the Early Middle Ages}}
After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, four major circles of influence emerged in Northern Britain. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland. In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]], who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]]. Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]] (later the northern part of [[Northumbria]]), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.<ref>J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, ''The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell'' (London: Continuum, 2000), ISBN 1-85285-195-3, p. 48.</ref> While the Picts and Scots would have remained [[pagan]], most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after the departure of the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced.<ref>O. Davies, ''Celtic Spirituality'' (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1999), ISBN 0809138948, p. 21.</ref>

==Early spread and missions==
{{See also|Hiberno-Scottish mission}}
[[File:Columba at Bridei's fort.jpg|thumb|upright|A nineteenth-century painting, showing the traditional, dramatic role of St. Columba in the conversion]]
The traditional view of the Christianisation of Scotland has seen it as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England. [[Richard A. Fletcher|Richard Fletcher]] argued that motivations for these missions may have included the example of [[St. Patrick]], the idea of [[Celtic Christianity#Pilgrimage for Christ|Peregrinatio]] and a growing interest in [[evangelism]].<ref>R. A. Fletcher, ''The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity'' (University of California Press, 1999), ISBN 0520218590, pp. 231-3.</ref> Missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland from at least the sixth century.

Fletcher, ''The Barbarian Conversion: from Paganism to Christianity'' (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1999), ISBN 0520218590, pp. 79-80.</ref> However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9>G. Markus, "Conversion to Christianity", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-19-211696-7, pp. 78-9.</ref>

===Britons===
{{See also|Hen Ogledd}}
Most scholars agree that the place-name element ''eccles-'', from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period. Most of these in Scotland are located in the south of the country in the area of the British successor states that would be known as the Hen Ogledd, or Old North.<ref>G. W. S. Barrow, "The childhood of Scottish Christianity: a note on some place-name evidence", in ''Scottish Studies'', 27 (1983), pp. 1-15.</ref> From the fifth and sixth centuries, inscribed stones indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland.

The figure of St. Ninian, traditionally credited with introducing Christianity to the region of south-west Scotland, is now widely regarded as a later construct and may have been the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint [[Finnian of Moville|Finnian]].<ref name=Fletcher1999pp79-80/><ref>T. O. Clancy, "The real St Ninian", ''The Innes Review'', 52 (2001).</ref> There was a church dedicated to him at [[Whithorn]] in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at [[Govan]] or [[Inchinnan]], which would extend an influence across the Strathclyde region.<ref name=Macquarrie2004p46>A.

Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 50-1.</ref> However, it clear that Christianity had already gained a foothold across what is now southern Scotland before the sixth century.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9/>

===Gaels===
{{See also|D<U+00E1>l Riata}}
[[File:Aberlemnokirkyardcropped.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Class II Kirkyard stone c. 800 AD from [[Aberlemno]]]]
The conversion of the Gaelic kingdom of D<U+00E1>l Riata in the west of modern Scotland is traditionally attributed to the work of St. Columba. However, given the close cultural and linguistic ties and the short distance across the seas between the region and Ireland, which had begun to be Christianised from at least the fifth century, it is likely that Christianity had already reached this part of modern Scotland before his arrival in the mid-sixth century. In this view the role of clergy owing their loyalty to Iona and elsewhere was to consolidate the position of Christianity in the region and beyond and to provide pastoral care for the people there.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9/> St Columba was probably a disciple of Finnian. He left Ireland after being exiled, and founded the monastery at Iona off the west coast of Scotland in 563, probably on land granted from a Christian king.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9/> From there missions were carried out to western [[Argyll]] and the islands around Mull. Later the influence of Iona would extend to the [[Hebrides]].<ref name=Evans1985pp77-89>C. Evans, "The Celtic Church in Anglo-Saxon times", in J. D. Woods, D. A. E. Pelteret, ''The Anglo-Saxons, synthesis and achievement'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1985), ISBN 0889201668, pp. 77-89.</ref> Iona emerged as the most important religious centre in the north of Britain, partly as a result of the work of [[Adomnan]], who was abbot there from 679 to 704. Although it is unclear whether the historic Columba did conduct missions outside of a small part of D<U+00E1>l Riata, Adoman's ''[[Life of St. Columba]]'' elevated him to become the apostle of North Britain in general.<ref name=Webster1997pp52-3>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 52-3.</ref>

===Picts===
{{See also|Picts}}
The means and speed by which the Picts converted to Christianity is uncertain.<ref>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, p. 53.</ref> [[Bede]] gives the credit for the conversion to Ninian, probably because in the eighth century when he was writing the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria was in control of the south-west of Scotland and an English bishop was in possession of the see, for whom Bede may have been reminding the Pictish church of its allegiance.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9/> Adomnan stresses the role of Columba in Pictland, and although the saint may have visited the region, since he does not make any claims for conversion it is unlikely that the saint had any major impact. A separate mission that may have been an attempt to evangalise the north-east was undertaken by Columba's younger contemporary, another Irish priest, [[Donn<U+00E1>n of Eigg]], who had a large number of churches dedicated in his name in the region.<ref>A. P. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80-1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), ISBN 0748601007, pp. 106-7.</ref> 

[[File:Saint Benedict Biscop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benedict Biscop]], founder of two monasteries and one of the key figures in the adoption of Roman Authority in Northumbria]]
The process may have begun earlier than traditional mission-based narratives. It is likely that knowledge of Christianity reached the region from D<U+00E1>l Riata, with which it had close contacts, including war, trade and intermarriage.<ref name=Markus2001pp78-9/> Traditions place fifth-century saint [[Palladius]] in Pictland after he left [[Ireland]], and link [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] with his contemporary Saint [[Brigid of Kildare]].<ref>O.

In the seventh century, [[St. Aidan of Lindisfarne|St. Aidan]] went from Iona to found a church at [[Lindisfarne]] off the east coast of Northumbria.<ref name=Evans1985pp77-89/> The influence of Lindisfarne would spread through the kingdom of Northumbria into what is now south-east Scotland.<ref name=Webster1997p51/> The Northumbrian church was increasingly influenced by the Roman form of Christianity. The careers of [[St. Wilfred]] (active from the 660s until his death in 709), abbot of the monastery at [[Ripon]] and Bishop of Northumbria, and [[Benedict Biscop]] (c. 628<U+2013>690), founder of the monasteries of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow]] and Wearmouth, intensified ties with Rome.<ref name=Webster1997pp53-4>B.

A bishopric established at [[Abercorn]] in the region of West Lothian, is presumed to have adopted Roman forms of Christianity after the Synod of Whitby. However, the Pictish victory at the [[Battle of Dunnichen]] in 685, ended the Northumbrian dominance of the region and the bishop and his followers were ejected.<ref name=RitchieandRichie1991pp171-2>J.

===Celtic Christianity===

[[File:Fra Angelico 052.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The "Roman" [[tonsure]]: in the Irish tradition the hair above the forehead was shaved]]
The result of different missions and forms of conversion was a series of overlapping and informally organised churches.<ref name=Webster1997p51>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, p. 51.</ref> In the past historians used the term Celtic Church to describe a specific form of Christianity with its origins in the conversion of Ireland, traditionally associated with St. Patrick and which later spread to northern Britain through Iona. It is also used as a general description for the Christian establishment of northern Britain prior to the twelfth century, when new religious institutions and ideologies of primarily French origin began to take root in Scotland. The Celtic form of Christianity has been contrasted with that derived from missions from Rome, which reached southern England in 587 under the leadership of [[St. Augustine of Canterbury]]. Subsequent missions from Canterbury then helped convert the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, reaching Northumbria in the early eighth century, where Iona had already begun to have an presence. As a result, Christianity in Northumbria became a mix of Celtic and Roman influences.<ref>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 51-2.</ref> 

While Roman and Celtic Christianity were very similar in [[doctrine]] and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there were differences in practice.<ref name=Macquarrie2004p46>A. Macquarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), ISBN 0-7509-2977-4, p. 52-3.</ref> The most contentious were the [[Computus|method of calculating Easter]], and the form of head shaving for priests known as [[tonsure]].

Pelteret, ''The Anglo-Saxons, synthesis and achievement'' (Waterloo, Ontario: Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1985), ISBN 0889201668, pp. 77-89.</ref> In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of [[clerical celibacy]], intense secularisation of ecclesiastical institutions, and the lack of a [[Diocese|diocesan structure]]. This made [[abbot]]s (or ''coarbs''), rather than bishops, the most important element the church hierarchy.<ref>C. Corning, ''The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church'' (London: Macmillan, 2006), ISBN 1403972990.</ref> 

===Growth of Roman influence===

[[File:Iona Abbey Celtic Cross.jpg|thumb|upright|St. John's cross which stood outside [[Iona Abbey]]]]
Wilfred was the major spokesman for the Roman case at the Synod of Whitby in 664, which was called by king [[Oswiu of Northumbria]] to decide which form of observance would be used in his kingdom, and where he decided in favour of the Roman form of tonsure and of calculating Easter. Although this only affected Anglo-Saxon Northumbria, from this point the distinctiveness of Celtic Christianity declined.<ref name=Webster1997pp53-4/> [[Nechtan mac Der-Ilei]], king of the Picts from 706, seems to have attempted to establish links with the church in Northumbria. Before 714 he wrote to [[Ceolfrith]], abbot of Wearmouth, asking for a formal refutation of the Irish position over the calculation of the date of Easter and for help in building a stone church "in the manner of the Romans". [[Archie Duncan|A. A. M. Duncan]] has suggested that there was a "Romanising group" among Nechtan's clergy, perhaps led by Bishop Curitan, who took the name Latin name Boniface. This is also suggested by the presence of a church at [[Rosemarkie]] in [[Ross and Cromarty]], dedicated to St Peter, seen as the first [[Bishop of Rome]], by the early eighth century, and subsequent similar dedications in Pictish territory.<ref name=Webster1997p54>B.

===Decline of Iona===
{{See also|Iona Abbey}}
Iona's place as the centre of Scottish Christianity was disrupted by the arrival of the Vikings, first as raiders, then as conquerors. Iona was sacked by Vikings 795 and 802. In 806 68 monks were killed and the next year the abbot withdrew to [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]] in Ireland, taking the relics of St. Columba with him. There were periodic returns of abbots and relics, often ending in more massacres.<ref name=Webster1997pp52-3/> Orkney, Shetland, Western Isles and the Hebrides eventually fell to the Pagan Norsemen, curtailing the influence of the church in the Highlands and Islands.<ref>W.

Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, p. 15.</ref> In 849, according to the [[Annals of Ulster]] the abbot of Iona once again took Columba's relics to Ireland, but the earliest version of the [[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba|Chronicles of the Kings of Scots]] says that in the same year they were removed by Kenneth mac Alpin, to a church he had built, probably at [[Dunkeld]], perhaps indicating that the relics were divided. The abbot of the new monastery at Dunkeld emerged as the Bishop of the new combined [[Kingdom of Alba]], which would subsequently come to be known as the Kingdom of Scotland.<ref name=Webster1997pp52-3/>

==Conversion of Scandinavian Scotland==

[[File:Olav Tryggvasson mynt.jpg|thumb|A coin of [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]], who is credited with the Christianistion of the Northern Isles]]
While the official conversion of Scandinavian Scotland took place at the end of the tenth century, there is evidence that Christianity had already made inroads into the Viking controlled [[Highland and Islands]]. There are a large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a "hermit's" or "priest's isle" from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion.<ref name=Macquarrie2004pp67-8/> According to the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', not written down until around 1230, the Northern Isles were Christianised by [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]], king of Norway, in 995 when he stopped at [[South Walls]] on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the local ''[[earl|jarl]]'' [[Sigurd the Stout]] and said "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised.

The Christianisation of Scotland brought the country into the cultural mainstream of Europe. When the Kingdom of Alba emerged in the ninth century it would be an overtly Christian kingdom and, despite its cultural diversity, religion would be a major source of Scottish identity. The [[Canmore dynasty]] that would rule Scotland from the eleventh century to the end of the thirteenth identified itself with Christianity and a strong relationship emerged between the crown and church.<ref name=Webster1997pp50-1>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (New York City, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 50-1.</ref> The acceptance of papal authority meant that in subsequent centuries the Scottish church faced claims for superior jurisdiction from the archbishoprics of both Canterbury and York and the independent status of Scotland in ecclesiastic matters would only be established by the papal bull of ''[[Cum universi]]'' in 1192.<ref name=Webster1997pp6-9>B.

Scottish monasticism also played a major part in the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], by which Scottish and Irish clergy undertook missions to the expanding [[Frankish Empire]]. They founded monasteries, often called [[Schottenkl<U+00F6>ster]] (meaning ''Gaelic monasteries'' in German), most of which became [[Benedictine]] establishments in what is now Germany. Scottish monks, such as St [[Cathr<U+00F3>e of Metz]], became local saints in the region.<ref>D. N. Dumville, "St Cathr<U+00F3>e of Metz and the Hagiography of Exoticism," in J. Carey, et al., eds, ''Irish Hagiography: Saints and Scholars'' (Dublin, 2001), pp. 172<U+2013>6.</ref> After the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles a common artistic style emerged in Britain and Ireland known as [[Insular art]].<ref>H. Honour and J. Fleming, ''A World History of Art'' (London: Macmillan), ISBN 0-333-37185-2, pp.&nbsp;244<U+2013>7.</ref> Surviving examples are found in metalwork, carving, but mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s with highly decorated with intricate patterning, like the [[Book of Kells]], which may have been wholly or partly created in Iona.<ref>C. R. Dodwell, ''The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800-1200'' (Yale UP, 1993), ISBN 0300064934, pp. 85 and 90.</ref> Insular art became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles.<ref>G. Henderson, ''Early Medieval Art'' (London: Penguin, 1972), pp.&nbsp;63<U+2013>71.</ref> The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.<ref name=Macquarrie2004p128>A.
