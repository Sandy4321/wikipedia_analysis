'''''The Quick and the Dead''''' is a 1995 [[western film]] directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and starring [[Sharon Stone]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The story focuses on "The Lady" (Stone), a [[gunfighter]] who rides into the 1878 [[American Old West|Wild West]] town of Redemption, controlled by the ruthless John Herod (Hackman). The Lady joins a deadly [[duel]]ing competition in an attempt to extract revenge on her father's death.

Writer [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]]'s script for ''The Quick and the Dead'' was purchased by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] in May 1993, and actress Sharon Stone signed on as both star and co-producer. Development was [[wiktionary:Fast track|fast track]]ed after director Sam Raimi's hiring, and [[principal photography]] began in [[Old Tucson Studios]] in [[Arizona]] on November 21, 1993. Distribution duties were covered by Sony-owned [[TriStar Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''The Quick and the Dead'' was released in the United States on February 10, 1995 to a dismal [[box office]] performance, and received mixed but generally favorable reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1878. In an attempt to seek vengeance on her father's death, The Lady enters a [[bracket (tournament)|single elimination]] gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless leader, John Herod. The Lady is introduced to Cort, a former Herod henchman turned [[reverend]], whom Herod forced to enter the contest. 

The Lady also shares a relationship with Fee "The Kid" Herod, an arrogant and young gunslinger who hopes to impress his ignorant biological father. Through donations by John Herod and [[Wells Fargo]], the winner of the contest will receive $123,000 in cash. As Cort is persecuted for abandoning his violent past in favor of a peaceful religious life, the first and second rounds of the competition ensue. Both Lady and Cort find that Herod's main goal of the contest is to eliminate anyone who might pose a threat to him. 

Haunted by her childhood traumas, Lady reflects that as a young girl, Herod manipulated her into killing her father, the town's former [[United States Marshall|Marshal]]. With Lady, Cort, Herod and The Kid left as the four remaining contestants, Kid challenges Herod to a duel to win his respect. Although they both injure each other with bullet wounds, John ultimately wins and denounces the fact that Fee was his son. He explains to the bystanders that his wife (Fee's mother) had an affair with a farmer. When Lady and Cort are forced to face each other, they devise a successful plan to kill Herod and free Redemption from his oppression. Cort then becomes the new Marshall of the town as Lady rides off into the sunset.

==Cast==
*[[Sharon Stone]] as Ellen ("The Lady"): The tournament's only female gunfighter. Has a personal vendetta against Herod for tricking her into killing her father, and finds an ally in Cort. When they have to eliminate one another, neither draw their guns at first; when Cort shoots her, everyone believes she has died, but she comes back to shoot Herod. [[Stacy Linn Ramsower]] plays Young Ellen in flashbacks.
*[[Gene Hackman]] as John Herod: Herod rules over the town from his mansion in its center; his mercenaries enforce his will, posing as the town's "Councilors". He also develops an attraction to Ellen, and invites her to dinner one night, where he reveals that he also has a tragic backstory: his father, a judge, forced him to watch people he had sentenced being hanged, and his wife abandoned him for another man.
*[[Russell Crowe]] as Cort: Herod's former right-hand man, who abandons his violent career in favor of a peaceful religious life. Herod has Foy and Ratsy burn Cort's [[Mission (station)|mission]] to the ground and force him to join the competition. He is arguably the fastest and most skilled shooter in Redemption.
*[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Fee "The Kid" Herod: Fee claims to be the son of John Herod and makes a living as the town's gunsmith and enters the tournament hoping to earn his father's acknowledgment and respect. He develops a crush on Ellen, and although she claims the opposite, she deeply cares for him and is greatly saddened when he is killed by Herod.
*[[Pat Hingle]] as Horace: Proprietor of the town's only saloon and manager of the gunfighter tournament.
*[[Roberts Blossom]] as Doc Wallace: Redemption's local doctor for as long as anyone can remember. He forms an alliance with Lady and Cort to stop Herod's oppression.
*[[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]] as Eugene Dred: Local pedophile who is goaded by The Kid into joining the tournament. Killed by Ellen in an unofficial duel after he rapes Horace's young daughter Katie.
*[[Keith David]] as Sgt. Clay Cantrell: Former Union soldier of the American Civil War. Cantrell is hired by the town to participate in the tournament in the hopes he will eliminate Herod in the process.
*[[Lance Henriksen]] as Ace Hanlon: Trick shot performer. who also entertains by telling tall tales of his exploits. He is however a fraud on several accounts and far less skilled than he claims. He is easily killed by Herod.
*[[Mark Boone Junior]] as Scars: Outlaw who was sentenced to 35 years for murder, but was released after a mere three days. He is bald, filthy and blind in one eye. Scars is eventually killed by The Kid.
*[[Tobin Bell]] as Dog Kelly: Outlaw bent on finding some buried loot, but he seems to have forgotten its location. Killed by Ellen in the tournament.
*[[Raynor Scheine]] as Ratsy: Herod's errant henchman who is killed by his own boss.
*Jonothon Gill as Spotted Horse: Sioux gunfighter who has a reputation for being impossible to kill. His body is covered with 14 bullet wounds; shot in the head by Cort after surviving a shot in the stomach.
*[[Olivia Burnette]] as Katie: Horace's teenager daughter who also idolizes Ellen.
*[[Gary Sinise]] as The Marshal: Ellen's father who is killed by Herod.
*Lennie Loftin as Flat Nose Foy: Gunfighter with bad teeth and a brood of ill-tempered young children. Wounded by Cort in the first round.
*[[Sven-Ole Thorsen]] as Gutzon: Champion shooter from his native country Sweden; a title nobody takes seriously. Wounded by The Kid in the first round and eliminated.
*[[Scott Spiegel]] as Gold Teeth Man: Eccentric [[hawker (trade)|street vendor]] of Redemption.

==Development==
Writer [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] finished his [[spec script]] for ''The Quick and the Dead'' in late 1992, writing it as a [[homage]] to the [[Spaghetti Western]]s of [[Sergio Leone]], particularly the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' popularized by [[Clint Eastwood]]. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. "When you introduce women into that kind of world, something very interesting happens and you have an interesting dynamic straight away," Moore commented.<ref name=first/> The names of the lead villain ([[Herod the Great|Herod]]) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible.<ref name=first/> Moore considered directing his own script as an [[independent film]] and shoot ''The Quick and the Dead'' on a $3-4 million in either Spain or Italy.<ref name=first/> 

[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased Moore's script in May 1993 and approached [[Sharon Stone]] to star in the lead role in July 1993.<ref name=first>Muir, pp. 171-179</ref> Because Stone also signed on as co-producer, she had approval over the choice of director. [[Sam Raimi]] was hired to direct because Stone was impressed with his work on ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1993). The actress told the producers that if Raimi did not direct the film, she would not star in it. Although she had mixed emotions on Raimi's previous work, she believed that the director still had yet to showcase his talents, feeling that ''The Quick and the Dead'' would be a perfect opportunity to "stretch the limits of his technical and creative ability."<ref name=Comp>{{cite book | author = [[Bill Warren]] | title = The Evil Dead Companion | month = | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | location = London | chapter = Blood Still in the Viens | pages = 162-179 | isbn = 0-312-27501-3}}</ref> Moore was also enthusiastic over Raimi's hiring, based on his previous work with the [[Evil Dead film series|''Evil Dead'' film series]].<ref name=first/>

When Sony began [[wiktionary:Fast track|fast track]]ing development ''The Quick and the Dead'', the studio commissioned a series of rewrites from Moore. The writer was eventually fired and replaced with [[John Sayles]], who, according to Moore, took Sony's orders of "making more of an [[American Old West]] film".<ref name=second/> Moore was rehired with filming to begin in three weeks because Sayles' script was approaching a 2.5 hour runtime. When rewriting the [[shooting script]], Moore simply omitted Sayles' work without Sony noticing. A week before shooting, Sony considered the script good so that Moore described the rewrites "a completely fucking pointless exercise".<ref name=second/>

==Production==
[[Russell Crowe]] originally auditioned for a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. "When I saw ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," Stone reasoned. "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him."<ref name=new/> Raimi found Crowe to be "bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like."<ref name=new>{{cite news | author = Jamie Diamond | title = Straight Out of Australia, to L.A. | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-03-26 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref> On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as "sort of like the fourth [[The Three Stooges|Stooge]]".<ref name=first/> 

Sony Pictures was dubious over Stone's choice of Crowe because he was not a famous actor in the mid-1990s.<ref name=first/> In order to get [[Gene Hackman]] to portray Herod, the film's antagonist, [[TriStar Pictures]] changed the shooting location from [[Durango]], Mexico to [[Tucson, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862241 | title = Douglas wows 'Greedy' cast, crew | date = 1993-08-16 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref> [[Sam Rockwell]] auditioned for The Kid, a role which ended up going to [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Rebecca Murray; Fred Topel | url = http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconfessionsintb.htm | title = Sam Rockwell Talks About ''Confessions of a Dangerous Mind'' | work = [[About.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref> Sony was also dubious over DiCaprio's casting. As a result, Stone decided to pay for the actor's salary herself.<ref name=first/>

Filming was originally set to begin in October 1993,<ref name=film/> but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia.<ref name=first/> [[Principal photography]] for ''The Quick and the Dead'' lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994.<ref name=film>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862363 | title = Lemmon enjoying fruitful outings | date = 1993-10-13 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862435 | title = Friends stunned, saddened by Shore's death | date = 1994-02-25 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref> Locations included [[Old Tucson Studios]] in Arizona<ref name=first/> and Mescal, 40 miles southeast of Tucson.<ref name=second/> Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems.<ref name=third/> [[Thell Reed (Shooter)|Thell Reed]], who was hired as the gun coach and [[weapons master]],<ref name=first/> worked with the cast through over three months of training.<ref name=second/> To age Cort's [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver]] and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. "I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust," he explained. "They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns."<ref name=third/> Such detail, including the [[nickel]] plating and ivory handles on Ellen's [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt Peacemaker]]s, was accurate to the time period.<ref name=third>Muir, pp.190-197</ref> 

The town of Redemption was designed by [[Patrizia von Brandenstein]], known for her work on ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).<ref name=second/> Raimi's first choice as the [[visual effects supervisor]] was William Mesa, his collaborator on ''[[Darkman]]'' (1991) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1993). Instead, Sony choose [[Framestore|The Computer Film Company]] to created the VFX sequences.<ref name=first/> [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|Pick-up]] scenes took place through November - December 1994. This included an extended duel between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman.<ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862606 | title = H'w'd pumped for sequel to 'Gump' | date = 1994-12-20 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref>

==Release==
A sex scene involving Stone and Crowe was deleted from the final cut in the United States prior to the film's release. The actress/co-producer believed the scene did not fit in with the picture's established reality.<ref name=second/> ''The Quick and the Dead'' was released in the US on February 10, 1995 in 2,158 theaters, earning $6,515,861 in its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed $18,636,537 in US totals<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=quickandthedead.htm | title = The Quick and the Dead (1995) | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref> and was declared to be a [[box office bomb]]. However, writer Simon Moore acknowledged that the film performed modestly in Europe.<ref name=second/> 

''The Quick and the Dead'''s dismal box office performance can be attributed to competition from ''[[Billy Madison]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', ''[[Just Cause (film)|Just Cause]]'' and ''[[Heavyweights]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.the-numbers.com/charts/weekly/1995/19950217.php | title = The Top Movies, Weekend of February 17, 1995 | work = [[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]] | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref> Director Sam Raimi later blamed himself and his visual style for the film's failure. "I was very confused after I made that movie. For a number of years I thought, I'm like a dinosaur. I couldn't change with the material."<ref name=second/> [[TriStar Pictures]] also showed ''The Quick and the Dead'' as an "out-of-competition" film at the May [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Staff | title = Cannes Festival Announces Nominees | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-04-27 | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref> A [[novelization]] written by [[Jack Curtis (writer)|Jack Curtis]] was published by [[HarperCollins]] in September 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Dead-Jack-Curtis/dp/0006496512 | title = The Quick and the Dead (Paperback) | work = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-09}}</ref> The [[DVD region code|Region 1 DVD]] release came in September 1998.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767817710/ | title = The Quick and the Dead (1995) | work = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-09}}</ref>

Based on 27 reviews collected by ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', 67% of the critics enjoyed ''The Quick and the Dead'' with an average rating of 6.2/10.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1059629-quick_and_the_dead/ | title = The Quick and the Dead (1995) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}</ref> By comparison, ''[[Metacritic]]'' calculated an average score of 49/100, based on 21 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/quickandthedead | title = Quick and the Dead, The (1995): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Stone's performance and Raimi's directing. "Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Raimi, the [[cult film]]maker now doing his best to reinvent the [[B movie]] in a spirit of self-referential glee."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | title = The Quick and the Dead | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-02-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}</ref> Critic and Raimi biographer [[Bill Warren]] wrote that the film "is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style and appeal of [[Sergio Leone]]'s majestically operatic [[Spaghetti Western]]s of the 1960s, especially the [[Man with No Name]] trilogy that starred [[Clint Eastwood]]. It's brisker, more romantic and somehow more American than Leone's movies."<ref name=Comp/> 

[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] from the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' observed that "Raimi tries to do a Sergio Leone, and though  ''The Quick and the Dead'' is highly enjoyable in spots, it doesn't come across as very convincing, perhaps because nothing can turn Sharon Stone into [[Charles Bronson]]."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/12414_QUICK_AND_THE_DEAD | title = The Quick and the Dead | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] criticized the film for being overtly [[clich<U+00E9>]], but praised Raimi's direction and [[Dante Spinotti]]'s [[cinematographer|cinematography]].<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950210/REVIEWS/502100302/1023 | title = The Quick and the Dead | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 1995-02-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'' magazine]] felt that "''The Quick and the Dead'' plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous westerns.
