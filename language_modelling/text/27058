The '''Song Dynasty'''  ({{zh-cp|c=<U+5B8B><U+671D>|p=S<U+00F2>ng Ch<U+00E1>o}}; [[Wade-Giles]]: Sung Ch'ao) was a ruling [[Chinese dynasty|dynasty]] in [[China]] between 960&ndash;1279 AD; it succeeded the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] era, and was followed by the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. It was the first government in world history to issue [[banknote]]s or paper money,{{Cref|b}} and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy.{{Cref|c}} 

The population of China doubled in size between the 10th and 11th centuries. This growth came through expanded rice cultivation in central and southern China and the production of abundant food surpluses.<ref name="ebrey 156"/> Within its borders, the Northern Song Dynasty had a population of some 100 million people.{{Cref|d}}<ref name="ebrey 156">Ebrey et al., 156.</ref> 

The Song Dynasty is divided into two distinct periods: the Northern Song and Southern Song. During the '''Northern Song''' ({{zh-c|c=<U+5317><U+5B8B>}}, 960&ndash;1127), the Song capital was in the northern city of [[Kaifeng]] and the dynasty controlled most of inner China. The '''Southern Song''' ({{zh-c|c=<U+5357><U+5B8B>}}, 1127&ndash;1279) refers to the period after the Song lost control of [[Northern and southern China|northern China]] to the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115<U+2013>1234|Jin Dynasty]]. During this time, the Song court retreated south of the [[Yangtze River]] and established their capital at [[Hangzhou]]. Although the Song had lost control of the traditional birthplace of Chinese civilization along the [[Yellow River]], the Song economy was not in ruins, as the Southern Song contained 60 percent of China's population  and a majority of the most productive agricultural land.<ref name="ebrey 167"/>  The Southern Song Dynasty considerably bolstered [[Naval history of China|naval strength]] to defend its waters and land borders and to conduct [[Maritime history#Asia and the Far East|maritime]] missions abroad. To repel the Jin (and then the [[Mongol]]s), the Song developed revolutionary new military technology augmented by the use of [[gunpowder]].{{Cref|e}} In 1234, the Jin Dynasty was conquered by the Mongols, who subsequently took control of northern China and maintained uneasy relations with the Southern Song. [[Mongke Khan]], the fourth [[Great Khan]] of the Mongol Empire, was killed in battle; his successor was [[Kublai Khan]], perceived both as the new Great Khan of the Mongols and as the [[Emperor of China]].<ref>Rossabi, 115</ref> After years of war, Kublai Khan's armies conquered the Song Dynasty in 1279. China was once again unified, but this time as part of the vast [[Mongol Empire]].  

The Song Dynasty was a culturally rich period  for the arts, philosophy, and social life. [[Landscape art]] and [[portrait painting]]s reached new levels of maturity and complexity after the heights reached by the [[Tang Dynasty]].  The social life was vibrant; social elites gathered to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs and cities had lively entertainment quarters. Philosophers such as [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]] reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused  with [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Exam-drafted [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] viewed themselves as the preeminent members of society, scorning any emphasis or favor shown to the growing merchant class and those of petty commercial vocations. Nonetheless, mercantilism was heavily embedded into  Song culture and society. Independent and state-sponsored [[architect]]s, engineers, carpenters, and craftsmen erected thousands of bridges, [[pagoda]] towers, temple halls, palace halls, and  other buildings throughout the empire. Literature on architecture was  widely distributed and read throughout China, while the central state agencies responsible for building and construction used standard codes published in building manuals.

===Northern Song===  
[[Emperor Taizu of Song]] (r. 960&ndash;976) unified China through military conquest during his reign,  ending the upheaval of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period]]. In [[Kaifeng]], he established a strong central government over the empire. He ensured administrative stability by promoting the [[Imperial examination]] system of drafting state [[bureaucrat]]s by skill and merit (instead of [[aristocratic]] or [[martial]] status) and promoted projects that ensured efficiency in communication throughout the empire. One such project was the creation by  [[cartographer]]s of detailed maps of each province and city which were then collected in a large [[atlas]].<ref name="needham volume 3 518">Needham, Volume 3, 518.</ref> He also promoted groundbreaking science and technological innovations by supporting such works as the [[astronomical clock|astronomical]] [[clock tower]] designed and built by the engineer [[Zhang Sixun]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 469&ndash;471">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 469<U+2013>471.</ref>

From its inception  with the first emperor Taizu, the Song Dynasty was engaged in alternating  states of warfare and diplomacy with the ethnic [[Khitan people|Khitan]]s of the [[Liao Dynasty]] in the northeast and with the [[Tangut]]s of the [[Western Xia Dynasty]] in the northwest.  The Song Dynasty  used military force in an attempt to quell the Liao Dynasty and recapture the [[Sixteen Prefectures]], a territory under Khitan control that was traditionally considered to be part of the Chinese domain.<ref name="mote 69">Mote, 69.</ref>  However, Song forces were repulsed by the Liao forces  who engaged in  aggressive yearly campaigns into northern Song territory until 1004 when  the signing of the [[Treaty of Shanyuan]] ended these northern  frontier border clashes. The Chinese were forced to pay heavy tribute to the Khitans, although the paying of this tribute did little damage to the overall Song economy since the Khitans were heavily dependent upon importing massive amounts of goods from the Song Dynasty.<ref name="ebrey 154">Ebrey et al., 154.</ref> More significantly, the Song state recognized the Liao state as its diplomatic equal.<ref name="mote 70 71">Mote, 70<U+2013>71.</ref>   The Song Dynasty managed to win several military victories over the Tanguts in  the early 11th century, culminating in a campaign led by the polymath scientist, general, and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&ndash;1095).<ref name="sivin III 8">Sivin, III, 8.</ref>  However, this campaign was ultimately a failure, and the territory gained from the [[Western Xia]] was eventually lost.<ref name="sivin III 9">Sivin, III, 9.</ref>

During the 11th century, political rivalries thoroughly divided members of the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist [[Chancellor of China|Chancellor]] [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989&ndash;1052) was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to make such reforms as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to allow a wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.<ref name="ebrey 163">Ebrey et al., 163.</ref> After Fan was forced to step down from his office,  [[Wang Anshi]] (1021&ndash;1086) became chancellor of the imperial court. With the backing of  [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] (1067&ndash;1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve what he saw as state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved [[land tax]] reform, the establishment of several government [[monopolies]], the support of local [[militia]]s, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical  for men skilled in  statecraft to pass.<ref name="ebrey 164">Ebrey et al., 164.</ref> The reforms created political factions  in the court with Wang Anshi's New Policies Group (Xin Fa), or the 'Reformers' in one camp, opposed by  the ministers in the 'Conservative' faction led by Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019&ndash;1086) in the other.<ref name="sivin III 3 4">Sivin, III, 3&ndash;4.</ref>  As one faction supplanted another in the majority position of the court ministers, it would demote rival officials and exile them to govern remote frontier regions of the empire.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  One of the prominent victims of the political rivalry, the famous poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037&ndash;1101), was jailed and eventually exiled for criticizing Wang's reforms.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>

While the central Song court remained politically divided and focused upon its internal affairs, alarming new events to the north in the Liao state finally came to its attention. The [[Jurchen]], a subject tribe within the Liao empire, rebelled against the Liao and formed their own state, the [[Jin Dynasty (1115&ndash;1234)|Jin Dynasty]] (1115&ndash;1234).<ref name="ebrey 165">Ebrey et al., 165.</ref>  The Song official [[Tong Guan]] (1054&ndash;1126) advised the reigning [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] (1100&ndash;1125) to form an alliance with the Jurchens and their joint military campaign  toppled and completely conquered the Liao Dynasty by 1125. However, the poor performance and  military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance with the Song and launched an invasion into Song territory in 1125 and another in 1127 when the Jurchens managed to capture not only the Song capital at Kaifeng, but the retired emperor Huizong and the succeeding [[Emperor Qinzong of Song]] as well as most of his court.<ref name="ebrey 165"/> This took place in the  year of Jingkang ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] <U+9756><U+5EB7>) and it is known as the [[Humiliation of Jingkang]] ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] <U+9756><U+5EB7><U+4E4B><U+6065>).  The remaining Song forces rallied under the self appointed [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (1127&ndash;1162), fleeing south of the [[Yangtze]] River to establish the Song Dynasty's new capital at Lin'an (in modern [[Hangzhou]]). This Jurchen conquest of northern China and shift of capitals from Kaifeng to Lin'an marks the period of division between the Northern Song Dynasty and Southern Song Dynasty.

===Southern Song===

[[Image:China 11b.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Southern Song in 1142]]
Although weakened and pushed south along the [[Huai River]], the Southern Song found new ways to bolster their already strong economy and defend their state against the Jin Dynasty. They had able military officers such as [[Yue Fei]] and [[Han Shizhong]]. The government sponsored massive [[shipbuilding]] and  [[harbor]] improvement projects, and the construction of [[beacon]]s and seaport [[warehouse]]s  in order to support maritime trade abroad and the major international [[seaport]]s, including [[Quanzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Xiamen]] that were sustaining China's commerce.<ref name="wang 14">Wang, 14</ref><ref name="sivin III 5">Sivin, III, 5.</ref><ref name="paludan 136">Paludan, 136.</ref>  To protect and support the multitudes of ships sailing for maritime interests into the waters of the [[East China Sea]] and [[Yellow Sea]] (to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]), [[South East Asia]], the [[Indian Ocean]], and the [[Red Sea]], it was a necessity to establish an official standing [[navy]].<ref name="shen 159 161">Shen, 159<U+2013>161.</ref> The Song Dynasty therefore established China's first permanent navy in 1132,<ref name="paludan 136"/> with the admiral's main headquarter stationed at Dinghai.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.</ref>  With a permanent navy, the Song were prepared to face the naval forces of the Jin on the Yangtze River in 1161, in the [[Battle of Tangdao]] and the [[Battle of Caishi]]. During these battles  the Song navy employed swift [[paddle steamer|paddle wheel driven]] naval crafts armed with [[trebuchet|trebuchet catapults]] aboard the decks that launched [[gunpowder]] [[bomb]]s.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476"/>  Although the Jin forces boasted 70,000 men on 600 warships, and the Song forces only 3,000 men on 120 warships,<ref name="levathes 43 47">Levathes, 43&ndash;47</ref> the Song Dynasty forces were victorious in both battles due to the destructive power of the bombs and the rapid assaults by paddle wheel ships.<ref name="needham volume 1 134">Needham, Volume 1, 134.</ref>  The strength of the navy was heavily emphasized after that. A century after the navy was founded it had grown in size to  52,000 fighting marines.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476"/> The Song government confiscated portions of land owned by the landed gentry in order to raise revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did not stop the Song's defensive preparations.<ref name="ebrey 239">Ebrey, 239.</ref><ref name="embree 385">Embree, 385.</ref>

Although the Song Dynasty was able to hold back the Jin, a new considerable foe came to power over the steppe, deserts, and plains north of the Jin Dynasty. The [[Mongol]]s, led by [[Genghis Khan]] (r. 1206&ndash;1227), initially invaded the Jin Dynasty in 1205 and 1209, engaging in large raids across its borders, and in 1211 an enormous Mongol army was assembled to invade the Jin.<ref name="ebrey 235">Ebrey et al., 235.</ref>  The Jin Dynasty was forced to submit and pay tribute to the Mongols as [[vassal]]s; when the Jin suddenly moved their capital city from [[Beijing]] to Kaifeng, the Mongols saw this as a revolt.<ref name="ebrey 236">Ebrey et al., 236.</ref>  Under the leadership of [[<U+00D6>gedei Khan]] (r.1229&ndash;1241), both the Jin Dynasty and Western Xia Dynasty were conquered by  Mongol forces.<ref name="needham volume 1 139">Needham, Volume 1, 139.</ref><ref name="ebrey 236"/>  The Mongols were at one time allied with the Song, but this alliance was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, [[Luoyang]], and [[Chang'an]] at the collapse of the Jin Dynasty. As the Mongols invaded and conquered [[Korea]], the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliphate]] of the Middle East, and [[Kievan Rus']] of [[Russia]], the Mongol leader [[Mongke Khan]] was killed in 1259 during the Battle of [[Fishing Town]] in [[Chongqing]], China.<ref name="ebrey 240">Ebrey et al., 240.</ref>  This prompted [[Hulagu Khan]] to pull the bulk of Mongol forces out of the Middle East where they were fighting the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluks]] to face the Song. By 1276,  most of the Song Chinese territory had been captured by Mongol forces.<ref name="needham volume 1 139"/>  With the [[Battle of Yamen]] on the [[Pearl River Delta]] in 1279, the Mongols finally crushed the  Song resistance, and the last remaining ruler, the child emperor [[Emperor Bing of Song|Bing]], committed suicide along with the official Lu Xiufu.

The Song Dynasty was an era  of administrative sophistication and complex social organization. Some of the largest cities in the world were found in China during this period  (with Hangzhou boasting a population of  one million).<ref name="ebrey 167">Ebrey et al., 167.</ref>  People enjoyed various social clubs and  entertainments in the cities, and there were numerous schools and temples to provide the public with education and religious services.<ref name="ebrey 167"/>  The Song government supported multiple forms of [[social welfare]] programs, including the establishment of [[retirement home]]s, public [[clinic]]s, and [[pauper]]'s [[graveyard]]s.<ref name="ebrey 167"/>  Although women were on a lower social tier than men (according to [[Confucian]] [[ethics]]), they  enjoyed  many social and legal privileges and wielded  considerable power at home and in  their own small businesses.

During this period the civil service examinations were greatly improved in an effort to select the most capable individuals for governance.  An individual's Confucian-based education could be augmented by attendance at one of the many  prestigious schools of learning. [[Yuelu Academy]], founded in 976 AD, was one of the earliest such schools to be established. The Chinese scientist [[Shen Kuo]] served as the head chancellor of the [[Hanlin Academy]],<ref name="needham volume 1 135">Needham, Volume 1, 135.</ref> established earlier during the  [[Tang Dynasty]]. There was also the [[Neo-Confucian]] [[Donglin Academy]], established in 1111 AD. The philosopher Zhu Xi re-established the [[White Deer Grotto Academy]], originally founded  during the [[Southern Tang]] Dynasty. The civil service system, enhanced by the [[Imperial examination|Imperial Exams]], allowed for greater [[meritocracy]], [[social mobility]], and equality in competition for those wishing to attain an official seat in government.<ref name="ebrey 162">Ebrey et al., 162.</ref>  State-gathered [[statistics]] suggested that having a father or other relative who had served as a high official of state did not guarantee an individual would obtain the same position of authority.<ref name="ebrey 162">Ebrey et al., 162.</ref>  Nevertheless, many felt disenfranchised by what they saw as a bureaucratic system that favored the land-holding class able to afford the best education.<ref name="ebrey 162"/>  One of the greatest literary critics of this was [[Su Shi]],  well known for his general criticism of the Song government.

The Song [[Judiciary|judicial system]] retained most of the [[legal code]] of the earlier Tang Dynasty.<ref name="ebrey 161">Ebrey, 161.</ref>  Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but  to promote morality in society.<ref name="ebrey 161"/>  Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of [[caning]].<ref name="ebrey 161"/>  Roving sheriffs   maintained law and order in the municipal juridsictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside.<ref name="McKnight 155 157">McKnight, 155&ndash;157.</ref>  Shen Kuo's ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' educated the Chinese in human [[anatomy]], spurring an interest in the performance of post-mortem [[autopsy|autopsies]] in China during the 12th century.<ref name="sivin III 30 31">Sivin, III, 30&ndash;31</ref><ref name="sivin III 30 31 footnote">Sivin, III, 30&ndash;31, footnote 27.</ref>  The physician and judge known as [[Song Ci]] (1186&ndash;1249) wrote a pioneering work of [[forensic science]] on the examination of [[corpse]]s in order to determine cause of death (strangulation, poisoning, drowning, blows, etc.) and to prove whether death resulted from murder, suicide, or accidental death.<ref name="gernet 170">Gernet, 170.</ref> Song Ci stressed the importance of proper [[coroner]]'s conduct during autopsies and the accurate recording of the [[inquest]] of each autopsy by official clerks.<ref name="sung 12">Sung, 12.</ref><ref name="sung 72">Sung, 72.</ref>

The visual arts during the Song Dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape  and portrait painting. An aristocratic elite engaged in the arts as  accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including  [[Chinese painting|painting]], composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]], and  [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]].<ref name="ebrey 81 83">Ebrey, 81&ndash;83.</ref>  The poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] and his associate [[Mi Fu]] (1051&ndash;1107) enjoyed [[antiquarian]] affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy.<ref name="ebrey 163"/>  Poetry and [[Chinese literature|literature]] profited from the rising popularity and development of the [[ci (poetry)|ci poetry form]], while enormous [[encyclopedic]] volumes were compiled, such as works of [[historiography]] and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. These included the [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', collected into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written [[Chinese characters]]. The  genre of Chinese [[travel literature]] also became popular with the writings of the geographer [[Fan Chengda]] (1126&ndash;1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' that used [[persuasive writing]] to argue for a philosophical point.<ref name="hargett 74 76">Hargett, 74<U+2013>76.</ref>  The imperial courts of the emperor's palace  were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] was  a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085&ndash;1145) who painted an enormous [[panoramic painting]], ''[[Along the River During Qingming Festival]]''. [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'' from the life story of [[Cai Wenji]].

In [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], [[Chinese Buddhism]] had waned in influence but it retained its hold on the arts and on the charities of monasteries. Buddhism had a profound influence upon the budding movement of [[Neo-Confucianism]], led by  [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] (1033&ndash;1107) and [[Zhu Xi]] (1130&ndash;1200).<ref name="ebrey 168">Ebrey et al., 168.</ref>  [[Mahayana]] Buddhism influenced Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi through its concept of [[ethical]] [[universalism]],<ref name="wright 93">Wright, 93.</ref> while Buddhist [[metaphysics]] had a deep impact upon the pre<U+2013>Neo-Confucian doctrine of Cheng Yi.<ref name="ebrey 168">Ebrey et al., 168.</ref>  The philosophical work of Cheng Yi in turn influenced Zhu Xi and, although his writings were not accepted by his peers, his emphasis on the Confucian classics outlined   by him  in his [[Four Books]] formed the basis of the Neo-Confucian doctrine. Zhu Xi's Four Books and his commentary on them became standard requirements to study for students attempting to pass the Imperial examinations by the mid 13th century.<ref name="ebrey 169">Ebrey et al., 169.</ref>   China adopted Neo-Confucianism, as did other countries of East Asia, including [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. Zhu Xi's teaching in both of these countries became known as the Shushigaku (<U+6731><U+5B50><U+5B66>, School of Zhu Xi) of Japan, and in Korea the Jujahak (<U+C8FC><U+C790><U+D559>). Buddhism's continuing influence can be seen in painted artwork such as [[Lin Tinggui]]'s ''[[Luohan]] Laundering''. However,  the ideology was highly criticized and even scorned by some. The statesman and historian [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007&ndash;1072) called the religion a "curse" that could only be remedied by uprooting it from [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] and replacing it with Confucian discourse.<ref name="wright 88 89">Wright, 88<U+2013>89.</ref>

The food that one consumed and the clothes that one wore in Song China were largely dictated by one's status and social class. The main food staples in the diet of the lower classes remained rice, pork, and salted fish;<ref name="gernet 136">Gernet, 136.</ref> their clothing materials were made of [[hemp]]en or [[cotton]] cloths, restricted to a color standard of black and white.<ref name="gernet 128">Gernet, 128.</ref><ref name="gernet 130">Gernet, 130.</ref> Pant [[trousers]] were the acceptable form of attire for farming peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants chose to flaunt more ornate clothing and male-[[blouse]]s that came down below the waist.<ref name="gernet 130"/> For the upper class of [[scholar-bureaucrats]], their choice in acceptable apparel was rigidly confined to a social hierarchic ranking system. However, as time went on this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced as it was in the beginning of the dynasty.<ref name="gernet 128"/> Each official was able to flaunt his awarded status by wearing different-colored traditional [[Han Chinese clothing|silken robes]] that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of [[girdle]]s that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.<ref name="gernet 127 128">Gernet, 127<U+2013>128.</ref> The main difference in women's apparel was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.<ref name="gernet 129">Gernet, 129.</ref> Women in the Song period wore long dresses, blouses that came down to the knee,  skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, while women from wealthy families could wear purple [[scarf|scarves]] around their shoulders.<ref name="gernet 129"/> There is a multitude of existing [[restaurant]] and [[tavern]] [[menu]]s and listed [[entr<U+00E9>e]]s for feasts, banquets, festivals, and [[carnival]]s during the Song period,<ref name="gernet 133">Gernet, 133.</ref> all of which reveal a very diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class.

The economy  of the Song Dynesty was one of the most prosperous and advanced economies in the medieval world. The Song Chinese invested their funds in [[joint stock company|joint stock companies]] with [[guild]] heads and  in multiple sailing vessels at a time when monetary gain was assured from the vigorous overseas trade.<ref name="ebrey 157">Ebrey et al., 157.</ref> Prominent merchant families, private businesses, and government-operated [[monopoly|monopolies]] shared the various industries that were developed to meet the many needs of a growing population.<ref name="ebrey 164"/><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 23">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 23.</ref>  The [[iron industry]] was pursued by both private [[entreprenuer]]s who owned their own smelters as well as government-supervised smelting facilities.<ref name="Wagner 178 179">Wagner, 178<U+2013>179.</ref><ref name="wagner 181 183">Wagner, 181<U+2013>183.</ref>  The Song economy was stable enough to produce over a hundred million kg (over two hundred million lb) of [[iron]] product a year.<ref name="ebrey 158">Ebrey et al., 158.</ref>  Large scale [[deforestation]] in China would have continued if not for the 11th century innovation of the use of [[coal]] instead of [[charcoal]] in  [[blast furnace]]s for smelting [[cast iron]].<ref name="ebrey 158">Ebrey, 158.</ref>  Much of this iron was reserved for  military  use in crafting weapons and armoring troops, but some was used to fashion the many  iron products needed to fill the demands of the growing indigenous market.

The economic power of Song China heavily influenced foreign economies abroad. The [[Moroccan]] [[Muslim]] [[geographer]] [[al-Idrisi]] wrote in 1154 AD of the prowess of Chinese merchant ships in the Indian Ocean and of their annual voyages that brought iron, swords, silk, velvet, porcelain, and various textiles to places such as [[Aden]] ([[Yemen]]), the [[Indus River]], and the [[Euphrates River]] in modern-day Iraq.<ref name="shen 159&ndash;161">Shen, 159<U+2013>161.</ref>  Foreigners, in turn, had an impact on the Chinese economy. For example, many [[Muslims]] went to [[China]] to trade, and dominated the import and export industry.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070208180239/www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/china_print.html | title = Islam in China (650&ndash;present): Origins | accessdate = 2007-08-01 | work = Religion & Ethics - Islam | publisher = BBC}}</ref>  Sea trade with the South East Pacific, the Hindu world, the Islamic world, and the East African world brought merchants great fortune and spurred an enormous growth in the [[shipbuilding]] industry of Song-era [[Fujian]] province.<ref name="golas">{{cite journal | author=Golas, Peter| title=Rural China in the Song | journal=The Journal of Asian Studies| year=1980| volume=| issue=| page=291&ndash;325| url=http://mutex.gmu.edu:2112/view/00219118/di973705/97p01513/4?searchUrl=http%3a//www.jstor.org/search/BasicResults%3fhp%3d25%26si%3d1%26gw%3djtx%26jtxsi%3d1%26jcpsi%3d1%26artsi%3d1%26Query%3dSong%2bDynasty%2bTechnology%2bScience%26wc%3don&frame=noframe&currentResult=00219118%2bdi973705%2b97p01513%2b0%2cEFFFFFFF0F&userID=81ae37f5@gmu.edu/01cc993312ea3113b864848d&dpi=3&config=jstor}}</ref>  However, there was risk involved in such long overseas ventures. To reduce the risk of losing money  on maritime trade missions abroad, the historians Ebrey, Walthall, and Palais write:

{{cquote|[Song era] investors usually divided their investment among many ships, and each ship had many investors behind it. One observer thought eagerness to invest in overseas trade was leading to an outflow of copper cash. He wrote, 'People along the coast are on intimate terms with the merchants who engage in overseas trade, either because they are fellow-countrymen or personal acquaintances...[They give the merchants] money to take with them on their ships for purchase and return conveyance of foreign goods. They invest from ten to a hundred strings of cash, and regularly make profits of several hundred percent'.<ref name="ebrey 159">Ebrey et al., 159.</ref>}}

===Gunpowder warfare===
Advancements in weapons technology enhanced by [[Greek fire]] and [[gunpowder]], including the evolution of the early [[flamethrower]], explosive [[grenade]], [[firearm]], [[cannon]], and [[land mine]], enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song's ultimate collapse in the late 13th century.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 80">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 80.</ref><ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 82">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 82.</ref><ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 220&ndash;221">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 220&ndash;221.</ref><ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 192">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 192.</ref>  The ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' manuscript of 1044 was also the first book in history to provide formulas for [[blackpowder]] and their specified use in different types of bombs.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 117">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 117.</ref>  While engaged in a war with the [[Mongol]]s, in the year 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his ''Kozhai Zagao, Xugaohou'' that the city of [[Qingzhou]] was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to [[Xiangyang]] and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 173 174">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 173<U+2013>174.</ref>  In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these same type of gunpowder weapons against the Song Chinese.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 174 175">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 174&ndash;175.</ref>  By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of [[gunpowder warfare]].

===Measuring distance and mechanical navigation===
As in earlier periods (for example, in the [[Han Dynasty]]), when the state needed to effectively measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Song Chinese relied on the mechanical [[odometer]] device. The Chinese odometer came in the form of a wheeled-carriage, its inner gears functioning off the rotated motion of the wheels, and specific units of distance marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell for auditory alarm.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 281&ndash;284">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 281<U+2013>282.</ref>  An 11th century Song government minister (Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong) writing about the Song era odometer's specifications is quoted extensively in the historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the [[South Pointing Chariot]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291.</ref>  This device, originally crafted by [[Ma Jun]] in the 3rd century, incorporated a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]] that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels' turned about.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287.</ref> The device concept of the differential gear for this navigational vehicle is now found in all modern [[automobile]]s in order to apply the equal amount of [[torque]] to wheels rotating at different speeds.

===Inventions and discoveries of polymaths===

[[Polymath]] figures such as the statesmen Shen Kuo and [[Su Song]] (1020&ndash;1101) embodied advancements in all fields of study, including [[biology]], [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[minerology]], [[mechanics]], [[horology]], [[astronomy]], [[pharmaceutical]] [[medicine]], [[archeology]], [[mathematics]], [[cartography]], [[optics]], [[art criticism]], and more.<ref name="needham volume 1 136">Needham, Volume 1, 136.</ref><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 446">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 446.</ref>  Shen Kuo's writing is famous for many reasons, as he was the first to discern magnetic declination of [[true north]] while using a compass,<ref name="mohn 1">Mohn, 1.</ref><ref name="embree 843">Embree, 843.</ref> his description of [[Bi Sheng]]'s invention of [[movable type]] [[printing]], a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern [[geomorphology]],<ref name="sivin III 23 24">Sivin, III, 23<U+2013>24.</ref> provided description of optical experiments with [[camera obscura]] just decades after [[Ibn al-Haytham]] was the first to do so,<ref name="needham volume 4 part 1 98">Needham, Volume 4, Part 1, 98.</ref> and his descriptions of improved technological designs such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the [[pole star]] (which had shifted over centuries of time).<ref name="sivin III 17">Sivin, III, 17.</ref> Su Song was best known for his horology treatise written in 1092, which described and illustrated in great detail his [[hydraulic]]-powered, 12&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) tall [[astronomical clock|astronomical]] [[clock tower]] built in Kaifeng. The clock tower featured large astronomical instruments of the [[armillary sphere]] and [[celestial globe]], both driven by an [[escapement]] mechanism (roughly two centuries before the [[verge escapement]] could be found in [[clock]]works of Europe).<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 445">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445.</ref><ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 448">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 448.</ref> In addition, Su Song's clock tower featured the world's first endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]],<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 111">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 111.</ref> an essential mechanical device found in many practical uses throughout the ages, such as the [[bicycle]]. Shen Kuo was also known for [[hydraulic]] clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank [[clepsydra]] which had more efficient higher-order [[interpolation]] instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time.<ref name="sivin III 17">Sivin, III, 17.</ref> Although the endeavors of the polymaths Shen and Su represent perhaps the highest achievements in technology and science during the Song period, there were many other significant technical writers and inventions. For example, Qin Guan's book published in 1090, the ''Can Shu'' (Book of [[Sericulture]]), described a [[silk]]-reeling machine that employed the first known use of a [[Belt (mechanical)|mechanical belt drive]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 107 108">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 107&ndash;108.</ref>

===Movable type printing===

Su Song's celestial atlas of 5 star maps is actually the oldest in [[printing|printed]] form.<ref name="sivin III 32">Sivin, III, 32.</ref>]]
The innovation of [[movable type]] printing was made by the artisan [[Bi Sheng]] (990&ndash;1051), first described by the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 1 201 203">Needham, Volume 5, Part 1, 201<U+2013>203.</ref><ref name="sivin III 27">Sivin, III, 27.</ref>  The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired [[typeface]] was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 33">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 33.</ref><ref name="sivin III 27">Sivin, III, 27.</ref> Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of [[woodblock printing|woodblock methods of printing]] thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing had a deep impact on education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies.<ref name="ebrey 159"/> The enhancement of widespread printing and [[print culture]] in the Song period was thus a direct [[catalyst]] in the rise of [[social mobility]] and expansion of the educated class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.<ref name="ebrey 159"/><ref name="ebrey 160">Ebrey, 160.</ref>

===Civil engineering and nautics===
There were considerable advancements in [[civil engineering]] and nautical technology during the Song Dynasty. The 10th century invention of the [[pound lock]] for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges to pass through.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 350 351">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 350<U+2013>351.</ref> There was the Song era innovation of [[Bulkhead (partition)|watertight bulkhead compartments]] for ships that allowed possible damage to the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] without sinking.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 463">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 463.</ref><ref name="ebrey 159"/> If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century discovered how to employ a [[drydock]] to repair boats while suspended out of water.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 660">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 660.</ref> There Song Chinese used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal like structure.<ref name="graff 86"/> [[Stern]]-mounted [[rudder]]s had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, and in the Song period they figured out how to mechanically raise and lower them in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths.<ref name="graff 86"/> The Song Chinese arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction, "making them more reliable" for anchoring ships.<ref name="graff 86">Graff, 86.</ref> Arguably the most important nautical innovation of the Song period was the introduction of the [[magnetism|magnetic]] mariner's [[compass]] for [[navigation]] at sea.<ref name="sivin III 22">Sivin, III, 22.</ref>  The magnetic compass was first written of by Shen Kuo in his ''Dream Pool Essays'' of 1088, as well as [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] in his ''Pingzhou Table Talks'' published in 1119.

==Architecture==
{{main|Architecture of the Song Dynasty}}
[[Image:Lingxiaopagodazhengding.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lingxiao Pagoda]] of [[Zhengding]], [[Hebei]], built in 1045.]]
Architecture during the Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as [[Yu Hao]] and [[Shen Kuo]] wrote books outlining the field of architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and engineering  in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting [[strut]]s built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing.<ref>Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 141.</ref>  Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types.<ref>Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 82-84.</ref>  The architect [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Treatise of Li Jie|Li Jie]] (1065&ndash;1110), who published the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103 AD, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire.<ref name="Guo 4">Guo, 4.</ref><ref name="Guo 6">Guo, 6.</ref>  He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork,  glazed tile making, and provided proportions for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] formulas in [[masonry]].<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 85">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 85.</ref><ref>Guo, 5.</ref>  In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings.

Grandiose building projects were supported by the government, including the erection of towering Buddhist [[Chinese pagoda]]s and the construction of enormous bridges (wood or stone, [[trestle]] or segmental [[arch bridge]]). Many of the pagoda towers built during the Song period were erected at heights that exceeded ten stories. Some of the most famous  are the [[Iron Pagoda]] built in 1049 during the Northern Song and the [[Liuhe Pagoda]] built in 1165 during the Southern Song, although there were many others. The tallest is the [[Liaodi Pagoda]] of [[Hebei]] built in the year 1055, towering 84&nbsp;m (275&nbsp;ft) in total height. Some of the bridges reached lengths of 1220&nbsp;m (4000&nbsp;ft), with many being wide enough to allow two lanes of cart traffic  simultaneously over a waterway or ravine.<ref name="volume 4 part 3 151">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 151.</ref>  The professions of the architect, craftsman, carpenter, and building engineer were not seen as professionally equal to that of a Confucian scholar-official as architectural knowledge had been passed down orally for thousands of years in China, from a father craftsman to his son. However, architectural engineering schools were known to have existed during the Song period; one prestigious engineering school was headed by the renowned bridge-builder [[Cai Xiang]] (1012&ndash;1067) in medieval [[Fujian]] province.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 153">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 153.</ref>

Besides existing buildings and technical literature of building manuals, [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Architecture in Song artwork|Song Dynasty artwork]] portraying [[cityscape]]s and other buildings aid modern-day scholars in their attempts to reconstruct and realize the nuances of Song archicture. Song artists such as [[Zhang Zeduan]], [[Li Cheng]], [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], Ma Lin, and Zhang Zerui painted close-up depictions of buildings as well as large expanses of cityscapes featuring [[Arch bridge|arched bridges]], halls and [[pavilion]]s, [[pagoda]] towers, and distinct [[Chinese city wall]]s.
