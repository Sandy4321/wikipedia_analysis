[[File:Warsaw Okecie airport old tower March 2003.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Frederic Chopin Airport|Ok<U+0119>cie Airport]]'s 1960s terminal buildings, the site of the incident's climax ''(2003 photograph)''|alt=A small 1960s-era airport terminal]]
The '''Ok<U+0119>cie Airport incident''' ({{lang-pl|Afera na Ok<U+0119>ciu}}) was a dispute between players and technical staff of the [[Poland national football team]] on 29 November 1980, starting at the team hotel in [[Warsaw]] and climaxing at [[Frederic Chopin Airport|Ok<U+0119>cie Airport]]. An incident of footballing insubordination at a time when [[strike action]] and other forms of civil resistance were intensifying in [[People's Republic of Poland|communist Poland]], it caused a domestic press storm, which led first to the suspension of several prominent players, then the resignation of the team [[Manager (association football)|manager]], [[Ryszard Kulesza]].

[[J<U+00F3>zef M<U+0142>ynarczyk]], the team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], was hungover when the time came to leave the hotel for the airport, having not been to sleep following a night on the town with a friend. Kulesza and one of his assistants, [[Bernard Blaut]], decided to leave M<U+0142>ynarczyk behind, much to the indignation of some players, including [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Terlecki]], [[Zbigniew Boniek]], [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Smolarek]] and [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw <U+017B>muda]]. Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove M<U+0142>ynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed M<U+0142>ynarczyk to travel with the team.

The Polish media took hold of the story and vociferously attacked the rebellious players over the following days. Meanwhile, Terlecki again defied the communist authorities by arranging for the players to meet [[Pope John Paul II]]. The [[Polish Football Association]] sent Terlecki, M<U+0142>ynarczyk, Boniek and <U+017B>muda home and imposed various bans preventing them from playing at the international and club level over the next year. Terlecki and Boniek in particular were condemned by the association as insubordinate "rabble-rousers".<ref name=majchrzak/> Smolarek received a more modest, [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] ban. Kulesza resigned in protest at the sanctions imposed on the players, saying they were too harsh. Most of the banned players were reinstated during 1981, but Terlecki was not<U+2014>he emigrated to the United States in June that year and although he returned home five years later, he never played for Poland again.

==Incident==

===Main incident===
[[File:Jozef Mlynarczyk.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J<U+00F3>zef M<U+0142>ynarczyk]], the team's [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], whose alleged drunkenness sparked the dispute.|alt=A moustachioed gentleman with a suit and tie]]
Late on 28 November 1980, the night before the team's departure for Italy, [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[J<U+00F3>zef M<U+0142>ynarczyk]] and forward [[W<U+0142>odzimierz Smolarek]], both of [[Widzew <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of M<U+0142>ynarczyk's, sports journalist [[Wojciech Zieli<U+0144>ski]], at the Adria nightclub. According to [[Andrzej Iwan]], another member of the team, the main topic of conversation was Zieli<U+0144>ski's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy.<ref name=majchrzak/> Several Poland players knew her, and M<U+0142>ynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged M<U+0142>ynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but M<U+0142>ynarczyk and Zieli<U+0144>ski stayed until about three hours later.<ref name=majchrzak/>

A senior national team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the [[Polish Land Forces|Polish Army]], said he saw the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00<U+2014>but rather than going to his room, M<U+0142>ynarczyk then left again with Zieli<U+0144>ski before returning again around 07:00.<ref name=majchrzak/> Tired and hungover, M<U+0142>ynarczyk joined the rest of the players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. M<U+0142>ynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him.<ref name=sport.pl/> Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, [[Bernard Blaut]], confronted Smolarek and told him that M<U+0142>ynarczyk was to stay behind.<ref name="sport.pl">{{cite news

Terlecki tried to stop the many pressmen at the airport from photographing M<U+0142>ynarczyk by running around, yelling, and snatching cameras and microphones from their hands. Meanwhile, the other players attempted to talk Kulesza around, telling him that M<U+0142>ynarczyk had serious personal problems. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed the goalkeeper to travel with the team.<ref name=majchrzak/>

===Press storm; players meet the Pope===
[[File:JohannesPaul2-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope John Paul II]], himself Polish, met the Poland team at the request of [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Terlecki]], one of the players.|alt=Pope John Paul II]]

Among the journalists at the airport were Jacek Gucwa of [[Telewizja Polska|Polish Television]], Bogdan Chru<U+015B>cicki of [[Polskie Radio|Polish Radio]], and Remigiusz Hetman of the weekly football journal ''[[Pi<U+0142>ka No<U+017C>na]]''.<ref name=majchrzak/> News about the incident quickly spread across the country, partly because of Terlecki's outlandish actions in the reporters' presence<U+2014>Iwan later reflected that Terlecki had "made so much commotion it was impossible to sweep everything under the carpet".<ref name=majchrzak/> Boniek corroborates this version of events: "Terlecki was massively to blame. He brought M<U+0142>ynarczyk to the airport in his own car, then pulled the plug powering a TV camera out of the wall."<ref name=majchrzak/> Grzegorz Majchrzak, a historian of the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]], questions Boniek's words, positing that he might have distorted events in an attempt to distance himself from Terlecki.<ref name=majchrzak/>

==Aftermath==

===Hearings and suspensions===

[[File:Ryszard Kulesza 1979.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ryszard Kulesza]], the team [[Manager (association football)|manager]]|alt=A smiling man in a suit and tie]]
Ryba announced on 1 December 1980 that he intended to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad.<ref name=majchrzak/> When the rest of the team returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he wrote a letter to the PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal.<ref name=sportsillustrated/> Only Terlecki, Boniek, <U+017B>muda and M<U+0142>ynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court.<ref name=sportsillustrated/><ref name=widzew/>

On 15 December, PZPN officials attempted to reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much M<U+0142>ynarczyk had had to drink. The team's technical staff said that he had been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only "three glasses of champagne and a sip of beer" with his friend.<ref name=majchrzak/> Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that M<U+0142>ynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision.<ref name=majchrzak/>

Terlecki's answers at this meeting under the questioning of General Ryba, a former military prosecutor, were typically provocative; when the general asked what time Terlecki had left the hotel on 29 November, the <U+0141>KS forward said 08:00. "Are you sure it was 08:00?" Ryba pressed<U+2014>"Are you sure it wasn't 08:02?" The player replied that he wasn't: "No. Maybe it was even 08:03. I don't know this time exactly, because I have one of your Russian watches."<ref name=sportsillustrated/>

[[File:Antoni Piechniczek VII kadencja Kancelaria Senatu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antoni Piechniczek]] replaced Kulesza as manager soon after the incident.|alt=A bespectacled, middle-aged man in a suit and tie]]
A week later, the PZPN announced its final verdict. The only versions of events accepted for consideration were those recounted by Kulesza and Blaut; those of all the players and of the team physiotherapist and sport psychologist were dismissed. <U+017B>muda and M<U+0142>ynarczyk were barred from playing for either Poland or their clubs for eight months, and Terlecki and Boniek for twelve. Smolarek received a two-month ban, which was [[Suspended sentence|suspended]] for six months.<ref name=majchrzak/><ref name=widzew/> Citing their previous records of insubordination and misconduct, the PZPN called Terlecki and Boniek "rabble-rousers".<ref name=majchrzak/>

===Reactions===

Kulesza left his job soon afterwards; according to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder some of the blame. Directors at Widzew and <U+0141>KS <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising [[Marek Dziuba]], [[Pawe<U+0142> Janas]] and [[Wojciech Rudy]], wrote an open letter expressing surprise at what they saw as excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, <U+017B>muda and M<U+0142>ynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.<ref name=majchrzak/>

Despite being without some of their top players, Widzew <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> were crowned champions of Poland at the end of the 1980<U+2013>81 season.<ref name="widzew">{{cite news

==Legacy==

Terlecki openly participated in [[Independent Students' Union|students' strikes]] at his old university in <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> and across Poland over the next few months, providing food to the students by the car-load. <U+0141>KS cancelled his registration in early 1981.<ref name=sportsillustrated/><ref name=sport.pl/> Majchrzak stresses that Terlecki was the only player involved in the incident not to regain his place in the Poland team, and claims that this was down to an intense grudge held against him by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and [[S<U+0142>u<U+017C>ba Bezpiecze<U+0144>stwa|Secret Police]] (SB). Terlecki developed his own theory that the media circus following the airport incident had been deliberately engineered by the SB to head the players off forming their own trade union. There were several other incidents of drunkenness involving M<U+0142>ynarczyk, Majchrzak writes, but this was the only occasion when any player was punished for it. In October 1981, when the team travelled to Argentina, M<U+0142>ynarczyk arrived at Ok<U+0119>cie "completely drunk", according to Iwan,<ref name=majchrzak/> but far from reprimanding him, team staff gave him even more alcohol during the flight to help ease the pain of his broken finger.<ref name=majchrzak>{{cite journal
