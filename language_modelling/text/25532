'''''The Joshua Tree''''' is the fifth [[studio album]] by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]], released on 9 March 1987 on [[Island Records]]. Written and recorded in [[Dublin]] throughout 1986, it was [[record producer|produced]] by [[Daniel Lanois]] and [[Brian Eno]]. The album is dedicated to lead singer [[Bono]]'s assistant, Greg Carroll, who was killed in a motorcycle accident during the album's recording.

In contrast to the atmospherics and [[ambient music|ambient]] experimentation of their previous album, ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'', on ''The Joshua Tree'', U2 aimed for a harder-hitting sound that used the limitation of strict song structures. Motivated by friendships with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Keith Richards]], and [[Van Morrison]] and a realisation that the band had a limited knowledge of music from before their childhood, U2 delved into [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]] and [[American roots music]]. Thematically, ''The Joshua Tree'' depicts the group's love-hate relationship with the United States, influenced by the group's touring experiences in the country, American literature, Bono's travels to Africa and Central America, and the band's participation in the [[Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. Lyrically and sonically, the group wanted a "cinematic" quality that evoked a sense of location, in particular, the open spaces of America. They represented this in the sleeve's photographs depicting them in American desert landscapes and with a lone ''[[Yucca brevifolia]]'' plant ("Joshua tree").

The album received critical acclaim, topped the charts in over 20 countries, and sold in record-breaking numbers. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', the album increased the band's stature "from heroes to superstars". It produced the hit singles "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]", "[[With or Without You]]", and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]". The album won [[Grammy Award]]s for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] in [[Grammy Awards of 1988|1988]]. ''The Joshua Tree'' is frequently cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history, and it is one of the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|world's all-time best-selling albums]], selling 25&nbsp;million copies. In 2007, a remastered version of the album was released to mark the 20th anniversary of its original release.

==Background==
Before ''The Joshua Tree'', U2 had released four studio albums and were an internationally successful band, particularly as a live act having toured every year in the 1980s.<ref name="classic-album" /> Their 1984 album, ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]'', [[The Unforgettable Fire Tour|their subsequent tour]], and the group's participation at [[Live Aid]] in 1985 and the [[Conspiracy of Hope Tour]] in 1986, had increased their stature and anticipation for the new album. U2 started writing for a new album in mid-1985 following the Unforgettable Fire Tour.<ref name="classic-album" /><ref name="m172" /> In the first half of the 1980s, the band had spent up to five months per year touring in the United States, and [[band manager]] [[Paul McGuinness]] recounts that ''The Joshua Tree'' came out of "the great romance" that the band had with the country.<ref name="classic-album" /> Lead vocalist [[Bono]] was reading the works of American writers such as [[Norman Mailer]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], and [[Raymond Carver]] so as to understand, in the words of ''[[Hot Press]]'' editor [[Niall Stokes]], "those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream".<ref>Stokes (1996), p. 76</ref>

In 1985, Bono participated in [[Steven Van Zandt]]'s anti-[[apartheid]] ''[[Sun City (album)|Sun City]]'' project, spending time with [[Keith Richards]] and [[Mick Jagger]]. When Richards and Jagger played [[blues]], Bono realised that U2 "had no tradition" and that they "were from outer space", as most of their musical knowledge began with [[punk rock]] in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono subsequently was inspired to write "[[Silver and Gold (song)|Silver and Gold]]", a blues-influenced song that he recorded with Richards and [[Ronnie Wood]].<ref name="m169">McCormick (2006), p. 169</ref> Until that time, U2 had been antipathetic towards roots music. Spending time with fellow Irish bands, [[The Waterboys]] and [[Hothouse Flowers]], U2 felt a sense of [[Folk music of Ireland|indigenous Irish music]] being blended with [[American folk music]].<ref name="m172"/> Nascent friendships with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]] and Richards encouraged the band to look back to rock's roots and focused Bono on his skills as a song writer and lyricist.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 179; Graham (2004), p. 27</ref><ref name="prop87">{{cite magazine |title=The Joshua Tree |magazine=Propaganda | date=1987-01-01|issue = 5}}</ref> Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music,<ref name="g28">Graham (2004), pp. 28-29; McGee (2008), p. 91</ref> and Bono's interest in music traditions was further demonstrated in his duet with Irish [[Celtic music|Celtic]] and folk group [[Clannad]] on the track "[[In a Lifetime]]".<ref name="g28" />

The band wanted to build on the textures of ''The Unforgettable Fire'', but in contrast to that record's often out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the discipline of more conventional song structures.<ref>{{cite journal | last =DeCurtis | first =Anthony | authorlink = Anthony DeCurtis| title =U2 Releases The Joshua Tree | journal =[[Rolling Stone]] | date =1987-03-27 }} cited in {{Citation | last =Gardner | first =Elysa (ed) | title =U2: The Rolling Stone Files | publisher =Sidgwick & Jackson | year =1994 | location =London | id = ISBN 0-283-06239-8 }}</ref> Guitarist [[The Edge]] wanted the band to continue the European atmospherics of ''The Unforgettable Fire'' and was initially reluctant to follow the lead of Bono, who was inspired by Dylan's instruction to "go back", and wanted to explore a more American, bluesy sound.<ref name="McGee93">McGee (2008), p. 93</ref> The group felt disconnected from the dominant [[synthpop]] and [[New Wave music]] of the time, and they wanted to continue making music that contrasted with these genres.<ref name="classic-album">{{cite video | people = King, Philip, and Nuala O'Connor (directors) | title = [[Classic Albums]]: U2 The Joshua Tree | medium = Television documentary | publisher = Eagle Rock Entertainment | date = 1998}}</ref>

==Writing, recording, and production==
In late 1985, U2 moved to drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]]'s newly-bought home to work on material written during The Unforgettable Fire tour. The material included [[demo (music)|demo]]s that would evolve into "[[With or Without You]]", "[[Red Hill Mining Town]]", "Trip Through Your Wires", and a song called "Womanfish". The Edge recalls it as a difficult period with a sense of "going nowhere", although Bono was set on "America" as a theme for the album.<ref name="m172">McCormick (2006), p. 172</ref>

Based on the group's success with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] on ''The Unforgettable Fire'', U2 wanted them to produce their new album.<ref name="O'Hare">{{cite magazine | title = The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' | magazine = [[Hot Press]] | first = Colm | last = O'Hare | date = 2007-11-21}}</ref> Mullen was excited about working with Eno and Lanois again, as he felt the pair, and Lanois in particular, were the first producers the band had worked with who "really [took] an interest in the rhythm section".<ref name="classic-album" /> Lanois later spoke of the band's progress in musical proficiency since ''The Unforgettable Fire's'' recording.<ref name="O'Hare"/> [[Flood (producer)|Mark "Flood" Ellis]] was [[Audio engineering|engineer]] for the sessions, marking the first time he had worked with U2.<ref name="McGee93" /> The band was impressed by his work with [[Nick Cave]], and he was recommended by Bono's friend [[Gavin Friday]], based on Flood's work with Friday's band, the [[Virgin Prunes]].<ref name="O'Hare" /> Flood recounts that the band had asked for a sound that was "very open... ambient... with a real sense of space of the environment you were in", which he noted were very unusual requests at that time.<ref name="classic-album" />

Intending to release an album in late 1986, U2 set up a studio in [[Glensouthwell|Danesmoate House]] in January of that year.<ref name="McGee93"/> A two-storey [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house in [[Rathfarnham]] in the foothills of the [[Wicklow Mountains]] near Dublin, the band wanted to use the new space to create atmosphere and inspiration, much like their use of [[Slane Castle]] for ''The Unforgettable Fire'' sessions in 1984.<ref name="McGee93"/> While the band mainly recorded downstairs, their friends [[Guggi]] and Gavin Friday used the upstairs rooms to paint, and Bono regularly joined them on trips into Dublin to work with artist Charlie Whisker.<ref name="McGee93"/> A makeshift control room with tape machines, a [[mixing desk]], and other [[Outboard gear|outboard equipment]] was set up in the dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing.<ref name="McGee93"/> The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed "non-studio" atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the "lyric room" and the recording space was called the "band room".<ref name="O'Hare" /> The band found the house to have a very creative atmosphere. The large drawing room, with tall ceiling and wooden floors, created an "ear-splitting" drum sound, that while difficult to work with, produced takes that ended up on the finished album.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 178</ref> Lanois recalls that it "was loud, but it was really good loud, real dense, very musical. In my opinion it was the most rock and roll room of the lot." He thought the room sounded better than Slane Castle, and he was particularly impressed with the room's "low mid-range (...) where the music lives", a property that he says was a major factor in the success of the ''The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="O'Hare" />

U2 began with their usual method of sorting through tapes from soundcheck jams, working through Bono's lyric book, and recording [[jam session]]s.<ref name="O'Hare" /> Eno and Lanois intentionally worked with the band at alternate times; one producer for a week or two, followed by the other. Eno and Lanois encouraged an interest in older songs, particularly American roots music. More contemporary references included the textural guitar work of [[The Smiths]] and [[My Bloody Valentine]].<ref name="O'Hare" /> The band's musical vocabulary had improved since their previous album, facilitating communication and collaboration with the production team.<ref name="O'Hare" /> One of the first songs worked on was "Heartland", which the band had started during ''The Unforgettable Fire'' sessions and eventually released on 1988's ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.<ref name="McGee93"/> "With or Without You" and "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", two of the album's most significant songs, were worked out early in the sessions, giving them the confidence to experiment.<ref name="O'Hare" /> Subsequent sessions at STS Studios in Dublin with keyboard player, producer, and engineer, Paul Barrett, in Dublin saw further development of "With or Without You" and the genesis of "Bullet the Blue Sky".<ref name="m172" /> U2's songwriting methods were also developing; not all material was being worked out in band sessions, rather Bono and The Edge often brought basic song ideas to the rest of the band.<ref>Graham (1996), p. 28</ref>

U2 interrupted writing sessions to join [[Amnesty International|Amnesty International's]] [[A Conspiracy of Hope Tour]] in June 1986. Rather than distract the band, the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music, and provided extra focus to what they wanted to say.<ref name="McCormick174">McCormick (2006), p. 174</ref> For bassist [[Adam Clayton]], the tour validated the "rawness of content" and their attempts to capture the "bleakness and greed of America under [[Ronald Reagan]]".<ref name="McCormick174"/> In July, Bono travelled to [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] and saw first hand the distress of peasants bullied in political conflicts, experiences which would form the basis of the lyrics for "Bullet the Blue Sky" and "Mothers of the Disappeared".<ref name="westwon">{{cite magazine | title = How the West Was Won | magazine = [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] | first = Stephen | last = Dalton | date = 2003-09-08}}</ref> The group experienced a tragedy in July when Bono's personal assistant and [[roadie]] Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. The 26-year-old's death had overwhelmed the U2 organisation, and the band traveled to his native New Zealand to attend his traditional [[M<U+0101>ori]] funeral.<ref name="westwon" />

On 1 August 1986, U2 regrouped at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in Dublin to resume work on the album.<ref name="McGee93"/> Work continued for the rest of the year, with the band also using Danesmoate, The Edge's newly-bought home, Melbeach, and STS Studios.<ref name="McGee93"/> "Mothers of the Disappeared" and "Bullet the Blue Sky" were among the songs that the group made progress on at Melbeach. Lanois recalls "the bulk of the record was done at The Edge's house. Even though the Danesmoate sessions were the backbone of the tonality of the record -- we got a lot of the drums done in there."<ref name="O'Hare" /> In August, [[Robbie Robertson]], the former guitarist and chief songwriter for [[The Band]], visited Dublin to complete an unfinished album for which Lanois was producer. As Lanois was working with U2, Robertson recorded two tracks with the group, which appear on his [[Robbie Robertson (album)|self-titled solo album]].<ref name="O'Hare" /><ref name="mcg98" />

Recording for ''The Joshua Tree'' wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been done after each song was recorded, to take "snapshots along the way (...) because sometimes you go too far", in Lanois' words.<ref name="O'Hare" /> The final weeks were a frantic rush to finish, with the band and production crew all suffering from exhaustion.<ref name="O'Hare" /> Lanois and [[Patrick McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]] mixed songs at Melbeach on an AMEK 2500 mixing desk, where without [[console automation]], they needed three people at the console. Eno and Flood had minimal involvement with the final mixes. In late December, U2 called in [[Steve Lillywhite]], producer of their first three albums, to remix a few of the new songs, in particular the likely singles. His job was to make the songs more appealing to commercial radio, and his eleventh-hour presence and changes caused discontent among the production crew, including Eno and Lanois.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 185" /> Lillywhite's remixing work was done on an SLL desk and extended into the new year.<ref name="O'Hare" /><ref name="mcg98" />

A creative spurt in October had resulted in new song ideas. However, they were shelved at Eno's suggestion lest they miss the deadline for the album's completion.<ref name="mcg98" /> These songs were finished in January 1987 following the completion of the album proper. They were used as B-sides to the album's singles and included "Walk to the Water", "Luminous Times (Hold Onto Love)", and "Spanish Eyes".<ref name="mcg99">McGee (2008), p. 99</ref> The band had considered releasing the ''The Joshua Tree'' as a double-album that would have included the B-sides. Bono was the most vocal proponent of the idea, whereas The Edge argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released.<ref>{{cite book | last = Stokes | first = Niall | authorlink = Niall Stokes | title = U2: Three Chords and the Truth | publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]] | date = 1989 | isbn = 978-0517576977}}</ref> U2 agreed that "Birdland" was too strong for a B-side and they held it for a future album release.<ref name="mcg99" /> In 2007, a re-recorded version of the song, retitled "Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)", was included with the 20th anniversary edition of the album.

On completion of the ''The Joshua Tree'', Bono said that he was "as pleased with the record as I can ever be pleased with a record". Although he was "very rarely pleased" with their finished albums to that point, he thought the new album was their most "complete" since their first.<ref name="prop87"/> In 1987, Clayton bought the Danesmoate house, and it remains his Dublin home.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.independent.ie/national-news/clayton-gets-goahead-for-lighting-system-1988286.html | title = Clayton gets go-ahead for lighting system | first = Shane | last = Hickey | work = [[The Independent]] | date = 2009-12-24}}</ref>

Following the influence and counsel of Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards, ''The Joshua Tree'' draws on American and Irish roots music more than previous U2 albums. "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" has strong gospel influences,<ref name="m181" /> "[[Running to Stand Still]]" exhibits folk and [[acoustic blues]] influences in the acoustic guitar and harmonica played on the track,<ref name="m181" /> and "Trip Through Your Wires" most strongly demonstrates the band's interest in blues.

Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States, including anger at [[Foreign Interventions of the Reagan Administration|United States foreign policy in Central America]], against the band's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and what it stood for.<ref name="McCormick186">McCormick (2006), p. 186</ref> Bono said, "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America",<ref name="m177">McCormick (2006), p. 177-178</ref> giving the album its working title, "The Two Americas".<ref name="classic-album" /> The band wanted music with a sense of location and a "cinematic" quality, and the album consequently drew on imagery created by American writers the band had been reading.<ref>Graham (2004) p. 27-30</ref> Having toured the United States extensively for a number of years, the group were influenced and inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert and rain appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert is used as a metaphor for "spiritual drought".<ref name="m177" /> One track that chiefly represents these themes is "[[In God's Country]]", which critics interpreted as addressing America's role as the "promised land".<ref name="bergen">{{cite news | title = U2 Touches N.J.

Political and social concerns were the basis for several tracks. Bono wrote the lyrics to "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]" after visiting El Salvador and observing how US military intervention hurt the local people. The Edge developed the song's aggressive, [[Audio feedback|feedback]]-laden guitar part after Bono told him to "put El Salvador through an amplifier".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=5131&Key=&Year= | title = U2 Lists: Top 10 Political U2 Songs | publisher = @U2 | first = Miranda | last = Greer | date = 2008-11-20 | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}; {{cite episode | title = U2 | series = [[VH1's Legends|Legends]] | network = [[VH1]] | season = 1 | number = 6 | airdate = 1998-12-11}}</ref> This trip also inspired "Mothers of the Disappeared", after Bono met members of [[COMADRES]]&mdash;the Mothers of the Dissappeared&mdash;a group of women whose children were killed or "disappeared" by the government during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].<ref name="mcg98" /> The 1984 [[UK miners' strike (1984<U+2013>1985)|UK mining strike]] inspired the lyrics to "[[Red Hill Mining Town]]", which Bono wrote from the perspective of a couple affected by the strike. The story of a [[heroin]]-addicted couple was the basis for "Running to Stand Still", which Bono set in Dublin's [[Ballymun Flats]]. For "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]", he describes the lyrics as a response to the idea that, in [[Belfast]], a person's religion and income can be guessed based on which street they live.<ref name="prop87" />

Bono described 1986 as "an incredibly bad year for me", which was reflected in the album's lyrics. His marriage was under strain, in part due to the album's long gestation period, the band was criticised by the Irish media for their involvement in the [[Self Aid]] event, and his personal assistant Greg Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin.<ref name="musician">{{cite magazine | title = U2 Give Themselves Away | magazine = [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] | author = Graham, Bill, and [[Niall Stokes]] | date = 1987-05-01}}</ref> Bono said, "That's why the desert attracted me as an image. That year was really a desert for us."<ref name="McGee93" /><ref name="westwon" /> "[[With or Without You]]" was written while he was struggling to reconcile his wanderlust as a musician with his domestic responsibilities.<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 179, 181</ref> "[[One Tree Hill (song)|One Tree Hill]]", named after a volcanic peak in Carroll's native New Zealand, describes how Bono felt at Carroll's funeral.<ref>McGee (2008), p. 97</ref><ref name="m177" /> The album is dedicated to his memory.<ref name="album notes" />

The Edge's guitar playing on ''The Joshua Tree'' demonstrates what came to be his trademark chiming, echo-laden sound. The album was recorded at the height of the 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] era, but The Edge's minimalist style sharply contrasts with the period's emphasis on technique and speed. Much of his rich sound is created by a [[delay (audio effect)|delay effect]].<ref name="flan43">Flanagan (1995), p. 43</ref> For example, the [[riff]] in the introduction to "Where the Streets Have No Name" is simply a repeated six-note [[arpeggio]], broadened by a modulated delay. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as "expensive", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible.<ref name="flan43" /> The riffs to "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" and "With or Without You" also prominently use a delay effect, with Bono likening the guitar hook from "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" to "chrome bells".<ref name="m181">McCormick (2006), p. 181-182</ref> The Edge continued to utilise ambient styles of guitar playing that began with ''The Unforgettable Fire''; on "With or Without You", he used a prototype of the [[Infinite Guitar]] to add layers of [[sustain]]ed notes, an approach first taken on his 1986 solo album, the [[Captive (soundtrack)|''Captive'' soundtrack]].

The group's religious faith was a source of inspiration for many lyrics. On "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For", Bono affirms this faith but sings of spiritual doubt ("I believe in Kingdom Come"... "But I still haven't found what I'm looking for").<ref name="album notes" /><ref>Stokes (1996), p. 65</ref> Some critics surmised that the place Bono is referring to on "Where the Streets Have No Name" is [[Heaven]].<ref name="globe" /><ref>{{cite book | title = Walk On: The Spiritual Journey of U2 | first = Steve | last = Stockman | publisher = Relevant Media Group | year = 2005 | edition = Revised | isbn = 9780976035756 | pages = 68-69}}</ref> These two songs have been singled out by some critics as demonstrating that the band was on a "spiritual quest".<ref name="bergen" /><ref name="globe" /> Several critics interpreted "With or Without You" in both romantic and spiritual manners.<ref>{{cite news | title = U2 Can Be Famous; Breaking into the Big Time with 'Joshua Tree' | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | first = Richard | last = Harrington | date = 1987-03-22}}</ref><ref>Stokes (1996), p. 66</ref> Bono makes Biblical references on songs like "Bullet the Blue Sky" ("[[Jacob Wrestling with the Angel|Jacob wrestled the angel]]", images of [[fire and brimstone]]) and "In God's Country" ("I stand with the sons of [[Cain]]").<ref name="album notes" />

The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong direction, they were prepared to "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".<ref name="musician" />

The band developed the idea for the sleeve design from what The Edge described as the album's "imagery, and cinematic location" in the desert. The initial concept for the sleeve was to represent where the desert met civilisation,<ref name="classic-album" /> and accordingly, one of the provisional titles for the album at that point was "The Desert Songs".<ref name="corbijn-box-liner">{{cite music release notes | First = Anton | Last = Corbijn | Name = The Joshua Tree | Year = 2007 | Format = 20th anniversary edition box set | Artist = [[U2]]}}</ref> They asked their photographer [[Anton Corbijn]] to search for locations in the United States that would capture this.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 185">McCormick (2006), p. 185</ref> In mid-December 1986, the band travelled with Corbijn and sleeve designer Steve Averill on a bus around the [[Mojave Desert]] in [[California]] for a three-day photo shoot. The group stayed in small hotels and shot in the desert landscape at locations such as [[Bodie]], [[Death Valley]], and [[Zabriskie Point]]; many of these photos appeared on the album packaging and in the concert tour programs.<ref name="mcg98">McGee (2008), p. 98</ref> Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in Death Valley; "It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in America."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corbijn.co.uk/page_photo_black_u2.htm |title=U2 |publisher=corbijn.co.uk |first=Anton |last=Corbijn | authorlink = Anton Corbijn |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>

On the evening after the first day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about [[Joshua tree]]s (''Yucca brevifolia''), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the [[American Southwest]], and he suggested their use on the sleeve.<ref name="classic-album" /> Bono consulted the [[Bible]] and was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology;<ref name="corbijn-box-liner" /> according to [[Mormon]] legend, early settlers referred to the Joshua tree as "the praying plant" and said that its branches represented the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Joshua]] raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled "The Joshua Tree".<ref name="corbijn-box-liner" /> That day, while driving on [[California State Route 190|Route 190]], they spotted an lone-standing tree in the desert, unusual for the plant, which is usually found in groups.<ref name="classic-album" /> Corbijn had been hoping to find a single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band among a group of trees.<ref name="corbijn-box-liner" /> They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone tree for about 20 minutes, something The Edge called "fairly spontaneous".<ref name="McCormick186"/> While shooting, the group found humour in getting Corbijn to say "Joshua tree", as his Dutch accent made him pronounce the name as "Yoshua tree".<ref name="classic-album" />

Corbijn's original idea for the sleeve was to have a shot of the Joshua tree on the front, with the band in a continuation of the photograph on the back.<ref name="classic-album" /> Ultimately, separate photographs were used for each side of the sleeve; an image of the group at Zabriskie Point was placed on the front, while an image of them with the tree appears on the reverse side.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atu2.com/news/u2-remembers-the-joshua-tree.html | title = @U2 Remembers The Joshua Tree | first = Matt | last = McGee | publisher = @U2 | date = 2009-11-09 | accessdate = 2010-04-28}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' believes the title and the images of the tree befit an album concerned with "resilience in the face of utter social and political desolation, a record steeped in religious imagery".<ref name="rs" /> In 1991, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked the album at number 97 on its list of the "100 Greatest Album Covers of All Time".<ref>{{cite magazine | title = The 100 Greatest Album Covers of All Time | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | issue = 617 | date = 1991-11-14}}</ref>  The tree photographed for the sleeve fell around 2000,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.henrywagner.org/pictures/California/Desert/JoshuaTree/ | title = The Joshua Tree | publisher = Henry Wagner Photography | accessdate = 2010-04-14}}</ref> yet the site remains a popular attraction for U2 fans to pay tribute to the group.

Just prior to the release of ''The Joshua Tree'', Bono was stricken with a sudden panic that the completed album was not good enough.

In 1996, [[Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab]] remastered the album and released it as a special gold CD. This edition rectified the incorrect track splitting between "One Tree Hill" and "Exit" that affected earlier CD releases; the quiet coda that concludes "One Tree Hill" had previously been included in the same track as "Exit".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.u2wanderer.org/disco/alb006.html | title = U2 Discography - The Joshua Tree Album / U2 | publisher = U2Wanderer.org | accessdate = 2010-04-20}}</ref>

Album reviews were almost universally positive, and the best of U2's career to that point. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said that "For a band that's always specialized in inspirational, larger-than-life gestures <U+2013> a band utterly determined to be Important <U+2013> ''The Joshua Tree'' could be the big one, and that's precisely what it sounds like."<ref name="rs">{{cite magazine | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20080618150201/www.rollingstone.com/artists/u2/albums/album/108063/review/6067670/the_joshua_tree | title = U2: The Joshua Tree: Music Reviews | magazine = [[Rolling Stone]] | first = Steve | last = Pond | date = 1987-04-09 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}</ref> The review described the album's sound as "wed[ding] the diverse textures of ''The Unforgettable Fire'' to fully formed songs, many of them as aggressive as the hits on ''War''".<ref name="rs" /> Steve Morse of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' echoed these sentiments in his review, stating "It's another spiritual progress report, enwrapped in music that strikes a healthy balance between the lushness of their last album, 1984's ''The Unforgettable Fire'', and the more volcanic rock of their early years."

==The Joshua Tree Tour==
{{Main|The Joshua Tree Tour}}
In support of the album, the band launched The Joshua Tree Tour. Consisting of three legs and a total of 111 shows, the tour took the band to arenas and stadiums worldwide from April 1987 to December 1987. Until the release of ''The Joshua Tree'', U2 had proportionally been more successful as a live act than as a record selling act.<ref name="classic-album" /> The album brought U2 to a new level of mega-stardom, as the tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size. Performances of the third leg were recorded for the 1988 motion picture and companion album ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''.

==Legacy==
{{ Quote box 
| quote = "During the two decades that have elapsed since then, every move the band has made has been, in some way, a reaction to the legacy of ''The Joshua Tree''. ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' was an extension of the album, further exploring American music forms such as blues, gospel, and soul. Then, inevitably, U2 got tired of living in their own shadow, and both ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and ''[[Zooropa]]'' chipped away at expectations of the band. When they finally realized there was no escaping their iconic status sealed by ''The Joshua Tree'', U2 mocked it on ''[[Pop (album)|Pop]]''. By then, though, fans had grown weary of the band's experimentation, and U2 have spent their last two albums trying to recapture the radio-friendly sound of their 1987 opus."

The band's penchant for addressing political and social issues, as well as their staid depiction in Corbijn's black-and-white sleeve photographs contributed to the group's earnest and serious image as "stone-faced pilgrim[s]".

==Track listing==
While the band and crew were working on the album's mixing, Lillywhite's wife, singer [[Kirsty MacColl]], volunteered to set the running order for the album. The band told her to put "Where the Streets Have No Name" first and "Mothers of the Disappeared" last. The rest were sequenced according to her preference, which the band kept.<ref name="McCormick 2006, p. 185"/>

[[File:U2-joshua-tree-20th-anniversary-box.jpg|thumb|right|The 20th anniversary box set edition of the album. Additional content includes a bonus CD and DVD, hardcover book, and photograph prints.]]
On 20 November 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of ''The Joshua Tree'' was released,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003658805 | title = U2's 'Joshua Tree' Blooms Again | work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | accessdate = 2010-04-20}}</ref> with a release in other regions following on 3 December 2007. The album was [[Audio mastering|remastered]] under the direction of The Edge. Manager Paul McGuinness explained, "There has been continuous demand from U2 fans to have ''The Joshua Tree'' properly re-mastered. As always, the band had to make sure it was right, and now it is."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/discography/index/album/albumId/4084/tagName/Reissues | title = The Joshua Tree (Remastered) | publisher = U2.com | accessdate = 2010-05-04}}</ref> Two of the remastered formats include a bonus CD that contains B-sides and rarities/demos from ''The Joshua Tree''. Some formats include new liner notes from the band members, the production team, Anton Corbijn, and journalist Bill Flanagan.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/26/AR2007112601943.html | title = U2's Roots Revisited In 'The Joshua Tree' | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]] | first = Chris | last = Klimek | date = 2007-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-05-04}}</ref> In an otherwise favourable review of the remastered album, Andrew Mueller in ''Uncut'' said that "any casual listener who can perceive a meaningful difference between this and the original has i) ears like a bat and/or ii) needs to get out more".<ref name="uncut-review" />

The album was released in four different formats:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.u2.com/news/article/2163/ | title = The Joshua Tree: Remastered | publisher = U2.com | date = 2007-10-19 | accessdate = 2010-05-03}}</ref>
