'''Route 87''' is a [[state highway]] located in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It runs {{convert|1.70|mi|km|2|abbr=on}}, heading north from [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 30]] (Absecon Boulevard) to [[Brigantine, New Jersey|Brigantine]], where it terminates at the end of the [[Brigantine Bridge]] over the [[Absecon Channel]], continuing as [[County Route 638 (Atlantic County, New Jersey)|County Route 638]] (Brigantine Boulevard). In Atlantic City, the route runs through the Marina District, which contains a few casinos, along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard. Here, Route 87 intersects with [[New Jersey Route 187|Route 187]] (Brigantine Boulevard) and the [[Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector]], the latter providing a limited-access route between Route 87 and the [[Atlantic City Expressway]]. Route 87 is the only road to and from Brigantine. 

What is now Route 87 was initially proposed as '''Route S4A''' in 1927, a spur from [[New Jersey Route 4|Route 4]] (now [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]]) in [[Tuckerton, New Jersey|Tuckerton]], [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean County]] south through Brigantine to Atlantic City. The portion of this route south of [[Little Beach, New Jersey|Little Beach]] was to be built by Atlantic County; however, the state took over plans of building the road in 1938. Despite this, Route S4A was never completed between Brigantine and Little Beach, and the portion of the road that existed in Ocean County was removed from the state highway system by 1941. In 1945, '''Route S56''', a spur of [[New Jersey Route 56 (1938-1953)|Route 56]] (now U.S. Route 30), was proposed to run from Atlantic City to Brigantine along Brigantine Boulevard. Route 87 was created on its current alignment in 1953 as an unsigned route, replacing Route S4A and the proposed Route S56. Previously, Route 87 split into two alignments in Atlantic City along Huron Avenue and Brigantine Boulevard; the Brigantine Boulevard alignment eventually became Route 187.

==Route description==
Route 87 begins at an intersection with [[U.S. Route 30 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 30]] (Absecon Boulevard) in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], heading to the northeast on Huron Avenue, a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} undivided road with two northbound lanes and three southbound lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the [[Atlantic City <U+2013> Brigantine Connector]] and comes to a ramp that provides access from southbound Route 87 to the southbound connector.<ref name=SLD/><ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=absecon+boulevard+and+huron+avenue+atlantic+city,+nj&daddr=route+87+%40+39.3883,+-74.415&geocode=%3BFYwEWQIdaISQ-w&hl=en&mra=ls&sll=39.380986,-74.427248&sspn=0.027466,0.055017&ie=UTF8&ll=39.381217,-74.427481&spn=0.027466,0.055017&t=h&z=14|title=overview of New Jersey Route 87 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>  From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five southbound lanes. It passes by the [[Borgata]] casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction.<ref name="google"/> The road becomes a {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} four-lane [[divided highway]] and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City <U+2013> Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector.<ref name=SLD/><ref name="google"/> Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87.<ref name="google"/> A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 187|Route 187]] (Brigantine Boulevard) and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.<ref name=SLD/>

The route passes to the west of the [[Trump Marina]] casino and comes to a ramp that provides access from northbound Route 87 to both the Trump Marina and [[Harrah's Atlantic City]] casinos before passing under the northbound Atlantic City <U+2013> Brigantine Connector again. Immediately after, the route has a ramp from the southbound direction that provides access to the connector and westbound U.S. Route 30. The northbound Atlantic City <U+2013> Brigantine Connector parallels Route 87 to the east as it turns northeast and comes to a [[right-in/right-out]] in the southbound direction that serves both Harrah's and Borgata.<ref name="google"/> From here, the route passes to the southeast of Harrah's, becoming a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} road.<ref name=SLD/><ref name="google"/> The northbound Atlantic City <U+2013> Brigantine Connector merges onto northbound Route 87 before the route comes to a ramp that provides access to the northbound direction of the route from Harrah's.<ref name="google"/> Past here, the route crosses over the Absecon Channel on a bridge and runs along the border of Atlantic City to the northwest and [[Brigantine, New Jersey|Brigantine]] to the southeast.<ref name=SLD/> After crossing the Absecon Channel, the route arrives on [[Brigantine Island]] and passes through wetlands, with U-turn ramps in both directions. A short distance later, Route 87 ends and [[County Route 638 (Atlantic County, New Jersey)|County Route 638]] continues along Brigantine Boulevard through Brigantine.<ref name=SLD/><ref name="google"/>
