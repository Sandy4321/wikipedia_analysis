{{French literature (small)}}'''Jean Genet''' ({{IPA-fr|<U+0292><U+0251><U+0303> <U+0292><U+0259><U+02C8>n<U+025B>}}) ({{birth date|mf=yes|1910|12|19}} <U+2013> {{death date|mf=yes|1986|4|15}}) was a prominent and controversial<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', Volume 45 By Daniel G. Marowski, Roger Matuz. Gale: 1987 ISBN 081034419X pg 11</ref> French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and [[political activism|political activist]]. Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but later took to writing. His major works include the novels ''[[Querelle of Brest]]'', ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'', and ''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]'', and the plays ''[[The Balcony]]'', ''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks]]'', ''[[The Maids]]'' and ''[[The Screens]]''.

==Life==
Genet's mother was a young prostitute who raised him for the first year of his life before putting him up for [[adoption]]. Thereafter Genet was raised in the provinces by a carpenter and his family, who according to [[Edmund White]]'s biography, were loving and attentive. While he received excellent grades in school, his childhood involved a series of attempts at running away and incidents of petty theft (although White also suggests that Genet's later claims of a dismal, impoverished childhood were exaggerated to fit his outlaw image).

After the death of his foster mother, Genet was placed with an elderly couple but remained with them less than two years. According to the wife, "he was going out nights and also seemed to be wearing makeup." On one occasion he squandered a considerable sum of money, which they had entrusted him for delivery elsewhere, on a visit to a local fair. For this and other misdemeanors, including repeated acts of vagrancy, he was sent at the age of 15 to [[Mettray Penal Colony]] where he was detained between September 2, 1926 and March 1, 1929. In ''[[The Miracle of the Rose]]'' (1946), he gives an account of this period of detention, which ended at the age of 18 when he joined the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. He was eventually given a dishonorable discharge on grounds of indecency (having been caught engaged in a homosexual act) and spent a period as a vagabond, petty thief and [[Male prostitute|prostitute]] across Europe<U+2014> experiences he recounts in ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (1949). After returning to Paris, France in 1937, Genet was in and out of prison through a series of arrests for theft, use of false papers, [[Vagrancy (people)|vagabondage]], lewd acts and other offenses. In prison, Genet wrote his first poem, "Le condamn<U+00E9> <U+00E0> mort," which he had printed at his own cost, and the novel ''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]'' (1944). In Paris, Genet sought out and introduced himself to [[Jean Cocteau]], who was impressed by his writing. Cocteau used his contacts to get Genet's novel published, and in 1949, when Genet was threatened with a [[life in prison|life sentence]] after ten convictions, Cocteau and other prominent figures, including [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], successfully petitioned the French President to have the sentence set aside. Genet would never return to prison. 

By 1949 Genet had completed five novels, three plays and numerous poems. His explicit and often deliberately provocative portrayal of homosexuality and criminality was such that by the early 1950s his work was banned in the United States.<ref>[[Edward de Grazia]], ''An Interview with Jean Genet''. Cardozo Studies in Law and Literature, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Autumn, 1993), pp. 307<U+2013>324.</ref> Sartre wrote a long analysis of Genet's [[existentialism|existential]] development (from vagrant to writer) entitled ''[[Saint Genet]]'' (1952) which was anonymously published as the first volume of Genet's complete works. Genet was strongly affected by Sartre's analysis and did not write for the next five years. Between 1955 and 1961 Genet wrote three more plays as well as an essay called "What Remains of a [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]] Torn Into Four Equal Pieces and Flushed Down the Toilet", on which hinged [[Jacques Derrida]]'s analysis of Genet in his seminal work "Glas". During this time he became emotionally attached to Abdallah, a tightrope walker. However, following a number of accidents and Abdallah's suicide in 1964, Genet entered a period of depression, even attempting suicide. 

From the late 1960s, starting with an homage to [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]] after the events of May 1968, Genet became politically active. He participated in demonstrations drawing attention to the living conditions of immigrants in France. In 1970 the [[Black Panthers]] invited him to the USA, where he stayed for three months giving lectures, attending the trial of their leader, [[Huey Newton]], and publishing articles in their journals. Later the same year he spent six months in [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] refugee camps, secretly meeting [[Yasser Arafat]] near Amman. Profoundly moved by his experiences in [[Jordan]] and the USA, Genet wrote a final lengthy memoir about his experiences, ''Prisoner of Love'', which would be published posthumously. Genet also supported [[Angela Davis]] and [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]], as well as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Daniel Defert|Daniel Defert's]] Prison Information Group. He worked with Foucault and Sartre to protest [[police brutality]] against Algerians in Paris, a problem persisting since the [[Algerian War of Independence]], when beaten bodies were to be found floating in the [[Seine]]. He expresses his solidarity with the [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF) of [[Andreas Baader]] and [[Ulrike Meinhof]], in the article "[[Violence et brutalit<U+00E9>]]", published in Le Monde, 1977. In September 1982 Genet was in [[Beirut]] when the massacres took place in the Palestinian camps of [[Sabra and Shatila Massacre|Sabra and Shatila]]. In response, Genet published "Quatre heures <U+00E0> Chatila" ("Four Hours in Shatila"), an account of his visit to Shatila after the event. In one of his rare public appearances during the later period of his life, at the invitation of Austrian philosopher [[Hans K<U+00F6>chler]] he read from his work during the inauguration of an exhibition on the massacre of Sabra and Shatila organized by the [[International Progress Organization]] in Vienna, Austria, on December 19, 1983. ([http://i-p-o.org/genet.htm Genet in Vienna]).

Genet developed throat cancer and was found dead on April 15, 1986 in a hotel room in Paris. Genet may have fallen on the floor and fatally hit his head. He is buried in the Spanish Cemetery in [[Larache]], Morocco.

==Genet's works==
===Novels and autobiography===
Throughout his five early novels, Genet works to subvert the traditional set of [[morality|moral values]] of his assumed readership. He celebrates a beauty in [[evil]], emphasizes his singularity, raises violent criminals to [[icon]]s, and enjoys the specificity of gay gesture and coding and the depiction of scenes of betrayal. ''[[Our Lady of the Flowers]]'' (''Notre Dame des Fleurs'' 1943) is a journey through the prison underworld, featuring a fictionalized alter-ego by the name of Divine, usually referred to in the feminine, at the center of a circle of ''tantes'' ("aunties" or "queens") with colorful sobriquets such as Mimosa I, Mimosa II, First Communion and the Queen of Rumania. The two auto-fictional novels, ''[[The Miracle of the Rose]]'' (''Miracle de la rose'' 1946) and ''[[The Thief's Journal]]'' (''Journal du voleur'' 1949), describe Genet's time in [[Mettray Penal Colony]] and his experiences as a vagabond and prostitute across Europe. ''[[Querelle de Brest]]'' (1947) is set in the midst of the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder; and ''[[Funeral Rites (novel)|Funeral Rites]]'' (1949) is a story of love and betrayal across political divides, written this time for the narrator's lover, Jean Decarnin, killed by the [[Germany|Germans]] in WWII. 

''[[Prisoner of Love (book)|Prisoner of Love]]'' published in 1986, after Genet's death, is a memoir of his encounters with Palestinian fighters and Black Panthers; it has, therefore, a more documentary tone than his fiction.

===Biography===
Genet wrote a biography of Swiss artist [[Alberto Giacometti]] entitled ''L<U+2019>Atelier d<U+2019>Alberto Giacometti''. Genet wrote in an informal biographical style, incorporating excerpts of conversations between himself and Giacometti.  Genet's own biographer, [[Edmund White]], said that, rather than write in the style of an art historian, Genet "invented a whole new language for discussing" Giacometti, proposing "that the statues of Giacometti should be offered to the dead, and that they should be buried."<ref>Kirili, Alain. [http://bombsite.com/issues/47/articles/1760 "Edmund White"]. ''[[BOMB Magazine]]''. Spring 1994. Retrieved 25 July 2011.</ref>

===Plays===
{{Genetdrama}}Genet's plays present highly-stylized depictions of ritualistic struggles between outcasts of various kinds and their oppressors.<ref>See Martin Esslin's book for one perspective on Genet's relationship both to [[Antonin Artaud|Artaud]]'s '[[Theatre of Cruelty]]' and to Esslin's own [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. Not all critics agree that Artaud is Genet's most significant influence; both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Luigi Pirandello]] have also been identified.</ref> Social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex layering through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play; maids [[Mimesis|imitate]] one another and their mistress in ''[[The Maids]]'' (1947); or the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before, in a dramatic reversal, actually becoming those figures, all surrounded by mirrors that both reflect and conceal, in ''[[The Balcony]]'' (1957). Most strikingly, Genet offers a critical dramatisation of what [[Aim<U+00E9> C<U+00E9>saire]] called [[negritude]] in ''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks]]'' (1959), presenting a violent assertion of Black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded. His most overtly political play is ''[[The Screens]]'' (1964), an epic account of the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]]. He also wrote another full-length drama, ''[[Splendid's]]'', in 1948 and a [[one-act play]], ''Her'' (''Elle''), in 1955, though neither was published or produced during Genet's lifetime. 

''[[The Blacks (play)|The Blacks]]'' was, after ''[[The Balcony]]'', the second of Genet's plays to be staged in New York. The production was the longest running [[Off-Broadway]] non-musical of the decade. Originally premiered in Paris in 1959, this 1961 New York production ran for 1,408 performances. The original cast featured [[James Earl Jones]], [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Godfrey Cambridge]], [[Maya Angelou]] and [[Charles Gordone]].

===Film===
In 1950, Genet directed ''[[Un Chant d'Amour]]'', a 26-minute black-and-white film depicting the [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] of a gay male prisoner and his prison warden. 

Genet's work has also been adapted for film and produced by other filmmakers. In 1982, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] released ''[[Querelle]]'', his final film, which was based on ''[[Querelle of Brest]]''. It starred [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]], [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Franco Nero]]. [[Tony Richardson]] directed a film, ''Mademoiselle'', which was based on a short story by Genet. It starred [[Jeanne Moreau]] with the screenplay written by [[Marguerite Duras]]. [[Todd Haynes]]' ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'' was also based on the writings of Genet.

Several of Genet's plays were adapted into films. ''[[The Balcony (film)|The Balcony]]'' (1963), directed by [[Joseph Strick]], starred [[Shelley Winters]] as Madame Irma, [[Peter Falk]], [[Lee Grant]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]]. ''[[The Maids (film)|The Maids]]'' was filmed in 1974 and starred [[Glenda Jackson]], [[Susannah York]] and [[Vivien Merchant]]. Italian director [[Salvatore Samperi]] directed another adaptation of the same play, ''[[La Bonne (film)|La Bonne]]''  (Eng.''[[Corruption (1968 film)|Corruption]]''), starring [[Florence Guerin]] and [[Katrine Michelsen]].
