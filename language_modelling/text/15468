The '''Corris Railway''' (Welsh: ''Rheilffordd Corris'') is a {{RailGauge|27}} gauge [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[heritage railway|preserved]] [[railway]] in the valley of the [[Afon Dulas]] on the border between [[Merionethshire]] (now [[Gwynedd]]) and [[Montgomeryshire]] (now [[Powys]]) in [[Wales]]. For most of its existence it ran from [[Machynlleth]] north to [[Corris]] and on to [[Aberllefenni]]. Branches served the [[Slate industry in Wales|slate quarries]] at [[Corris Uchaf]], [[Aberllefenni]], the isolated quarries around [[Ratgoed]] and quarries along the length of the Dulas valley.

== History ==
===Tramroad era: 1850 to 1878 ===
Proposals to construct a line to connect the [[slate]] quarries in the district around [[Corris]],[[Corris Uchaf]] and [[Aberllefenni]] with wharves on the estuary of the [[Afon Dyfi]] at [[Derwenlas]] and [[Morben]], south-west of [[Machynlleth]], first appeared around 1850, but it was not until 1st April [[1859]] <ref name=Return>{{cite book |title=A Return to Corris |author=The Corris Railway Society |publisher=Avon-Anglia Publications |year=1988 |id=ISBN 0905466896}}</ref> that the horse-worked '''Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad''' opened.  By [[1864]] an Act of Parliament was passed changing the name to the '''Corris Railway Company''' and permitting the use of locomotives on the line. It appears that around this time the line was under the control of [[Thomas Savin]], the contractor who built the standard gauge lines in the area. The line between Machynlleth and Derwenlas was abandoned following the arrival of the [[standard gauge]] [[Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway]] (later the [[Cambrian Railways]]).

=== Years of Prosperity : 1879 to 1906 ===
[[Image:Grand Tour Charabancs.jpg|thumb|right|Horse-drawn charabancs owned by the Corris Railway pass [[Tal-y-llyn Lake]] on the "Grand Tour"]]
In 1878 the Corris Railway Company was bought by the [[Imperial Tramways Company]] of [[London]] who first introduced passenger carriages and then, in 1879, [[steam locomotive]]s. Although the carriages arrived in 1878 it was not until 1883 that the Act of Parliament was secured to allow the formal commencement of passenger services. A semi-official passenger service had been running since the early 1870's using open wagons to convey quarry workers and visitors.

The initial passenger service ran from Machynlleth to Corris, but was extended to the line's northern terminus at Aberllefenni in 1887. In 1892 control of Imperial Tramways moved to [[Bristol]] and [[George White (businessman)|George White]] of [[Bristol Omnibus Company|Bristol Tramways]] became chairman.

The railway developed a network of horse-hauled road services, including providing a link between Corris station and [[Abergynolwyn railway station|Abergynolwyn station]] on the [[Talyllyn Railway]]. This was promoted as part of a circular "[[Corris Railway Grand Tour|Grand Tour]]" which took in the two narrow gauge railways and the Cambrian service between [[Tywyn]] and Machynlleth. In the 1900s Bristol motor buses were sent by the parent company to run these services.

=== Decline: 1907 to 1930 ===

The closure of [[Braichgoch Slate Mine|Braichgoch Quarry]] in 1906 brought the railway its first loss, and although the line continued on through subsequent decades, serving the quarries around [[Corris]] and [[Aberllefenni]], it never again showed a profit. As well as slate and passengers, the line hauled timber extracted from the Dyfi forest in the 1910s through 1930s. There was also a constant traffic in [[coal]] and general goods to the quarries and communities served by the railway.

After [[World War I]], the decline in slate traffic continued as cheaper foreign slate and alternative [[roof|roofing material]]s became popular. The railway went into a similar slow decline, although the connecting bus services were developed and extended.

=== Takeover and nationalisation: 1931 to 1948 ===

In [[1930]] it was purchased by the [[Great Western Railway]] (who by that time were the owners of the main line serving Machynlleth) whose primary interest was taking control of the railway's bus routes. After running a bus in direct competition with the railway in 1930, the railway's passenger service was withdrawn at the beginning of [[1931]]. In 1948 the line was nationalised along with its parent company as part of [[British Rail|British Railways]]. Serious erosion to the railway formation caused by the Afon Dyfi led to closure later that year, the last train running on 20th August 1948.

The two remaining locomotives and several goods wagons were purchased in 1951 by the newly preserved [[Talyllyn Railway]] which shares the unusual {{RailGauge|27}} gauge. This stock is still in operation just over the mountain at [[Tywyn]].

== About the railway ==

[[Image:CorrisStation.png|thumb|350px|right|Corris Station]]

The Corris Railway had several unusual features:

* The 2&nbsp;ft&nbsp;3&nbsp;in gauge is rare, shared by only three other public lines in the UK: the nearby [[Talyllyn Railway]] and [[Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway]] and the [[Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway]] in Scotland.

* Its origins as a horse tramroad and ascent through the narrow and winding Dulas valley meant it had exceptionally tight curves. Its original passenger carriages were simple 4-wheelers derived from urban horse-drawn tramway designs with end balconies; they rode poorly and were quickly rebuilt into longer bogie carriages by placing two of the original bodies end-to-end on a longer underframe.

* The stations were exceptionally narrow, again because of the geography of the line, and all were on the east side of the rails, so the carriages and locomotives had doors on that side only, as on the neighbouring [[Talyllyn Railway]].

* The vertical trestle waggons for carrying large slabs of slate from the quarries were also rarely found on other railways, notable exceptions being the [[Ffestiniog Railway]] and the nearby [[Hendre-Ddu Tramway]].

* Corris Station and the original Machynlleth Station had overall roofs, features which were rare on a British narrow gauge railway

=== '''Stations''' & Halts ===

* Cei (or Quay) Ward a wharf on the Afon Dyfi at [[Morben]], the main trans-shipment point for the original tramroad. Closed in the 1860s.
* Cei Tafarn Isa and Cei Ellis, wharves on the Afon Dyfi at [[Derwenlas]] where slates were off-loaded onto shipping. Closed in the 1860s when the bend of the river was cut off by the construction of the [[Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway]]. 
* '''[[Machynlleth]]''' the main slate transshipment point and interchange station with the [[Cambrian Railways]] (later GWR and BR)
* '''[[Ffridd Gate]]''' for [[Llanwrin]]
* Doldderwen Crossing
* Lliwdy
* '''[[Llwyngwern]]''' for [[Pantperthog]]
* '''[[Esgairgeiliog]]''' for [[Ceinws]]
* [[Maespoeth Junction]] locomotive and carriage shed, no passenger station
* '''[[Corris]]'''
* '''Garneddwen'''
* '''[[Aberllefenni]]'''

=== Branch lines and tramways ===

The Corris Railway had numerous branch lines, mainly built to serve the slate quarries along its route. The principal branches were:

* Llwyngwern quarry tramway, at [[Llwyngwern]]
* Era Slate quarry tramway at [[Esgairgeiliog]]
* the ''Upper Corris Tramway'' from [[Maespoeth Junction]] to quarries surrounding [[Corris Uchaf]]
* Matthew's Mill Siding near [[Aberllefenni]] serving Y Magnus slate enamelling works
* Aberllefenni Quarry tramway serving the slate mills and quarry adits
* the ''Ratgoed Tramway'' north of [[Aberllefenni]] serving Cymerau Quarry and [[Ratgoed Quarry]]

None of these branches were locomotive worked, instead being powered by gravity and horses.

=== Quarries Served ===

The principal reason for the existence of the Corris Railway was to serve the slate quarries of this district. Although usually referred to as quarries, those on the [[Narrow Vein]] were usually underground mine workings, following the course of the vein, while those on the [[Broad Vein]] were more usually opencast quarries. This list shows the main quarries that the railway served:

* [[Llwyngwern]] quarry - connected by its own tramway
* Era Quarry and Slab Works at [[Esgairgeiliog]] - connected by its own tramway
* [[Abercorris quarry]] - connected to the Upper Corris tramway
* Gaewern quarry - connected to the Upper Corris tramway, subsequently worked together with Braichgoch. 
* [[Braichgoch Slate Mine|Braichgoch Quarry]] - connected to the Upper Corris tramway
* Abercwmmeiddaw quarry - connected to the Upper Corris tramway and the main Broad Vein quarry in the Corris area. 
* [[Aberllefenni Slate Quarry]] - connected via internal tramway at [[Aberllefenni]]
* Cymerau quarry - connected to the Ratgoed tramway
* [[Ratgoed Quarry]] - connected to the Ratgoed tramway

The railway also served Y Magnus (Matthew's Mill), a slate enamelling works situated between Aberllefenni and Garneddwen.

== The Corris Railway Society ==
[[Image:Tivedshambo 2006-10-28 Corris No 7.jpg|thumb|250px|The Corris Railway's own steam locomotive, No. 7, at Corris on [[28 October]] [[2006]].]]
In 1966 a group of dedicated enthusiasts led by Alan Meaden, formed the Corris Railway Society with the hope of reviving the original Corris Railway. Many of the founding members of the Society were volunteers on the nearby [[Talyllyn Railway]].

All of the track of the railway had been lifted in the early 1950s, and the main buildings of Corris station were demolished in 1968 leaving only the adjacent railway stable block standing. As a result, early progress was slow as the Society had no formal base or access to the trackbed. In [[1970]] the railway's stable block at Corris was acquired and opened as the '''Corris Railway Museum'''. A short length of "demonstration" track was laid in [[1971]].

In [[1981]] the line's original locomotive shed at Maespoeth was acquired and became the Society's operational base. During the 1980's track was laid between Maespoeth and Corris, a distance of just under a mile (1.6 km). The formal "first train" back to Corris ran in [[1985]]. In the following years the track was upgraded with the aim of resuming passenger services over the line.

The Society continued to build a friendly relationship with its neighbouring [[Talyllyn Railway]], which resulted in both of the original Corris locos and rolling stock running on the revived Corris. In [[1996]] [[Kerr Stuart]] 0-4-2ST Tattoo class loco No.4 "Edward Thomas" was loaned to the Corris to celebrate its 75th anniversary. In [[2003]] the other surviving Corris loco, Hughes 0-4-2ST No.3 "Sir Haydn" visited the Corris on the occasion of its 125th anniversary with a heritage train of coach No 17, brake van No 6 and two trucks. Corris No.5 has travelled in the opposite direction and has been - so far - the only visiting locomotive to operate passenger trains on the Talyllyn.

In the summer of [[2002]] passenger services resumed after a break of seventy-two years. The society has also built a new steam locomotive, to a design based on the [[Kerr Stuart]] No.4. This loco arrived on the railway on May 17th 2005 and runs as No.7 (the Corris Railway never officially named its locomotives). No.7 went into service on 20th August 2005, fifty-seven years to the day since the last train on the original railway, and now hauls the regular passenger service between Corris and Maespoeth.

The society is also actively pursuing a southwards extension towards [[Machynlleth]], with the initial aim of extending the line to Tan-y-Coed, midway between [[Esgairgeiliog]] and [[Llwyngwern]] and some two and a half miles south of Corris.

==Carriages==

The original railway had ten four-wheel, tramcar-like carriages, built at the [[Falcon Works]], [[Loughborough]], and numbered from 1 to 10, with a brake van from the same source taking the number 11. The first bogie carriage, which looked like two four-wheel bodies mounted on a single chassis, received number 12, and the four-wheelers were rebuilt over a five-year period on new chassis to form five bogie vehicles. A re-numbering had the rebuilds as 1 to 5 and the former 12 becoming 6. Two all-new carriages to a similar design were built by Metropolitan and numbered 7 & 8. Nos. 1 to 6 disappeared, presumed scrapped, after 1930, but 8 was rebuilt for use on the [[Talyllyn Railway]] as their No.17 while 7 is on display in the Corris Railway Museum. The brake van was also preserved on the Talyllyn but has been substantially rebuilt after being damaged in a fire. 

So with eleven four-wheel vehicles and eight bogie vehicles having run on the railway, the Society has numbered its new carriages from 20 onwards.

Carriage 20 is similar in appearance to the bogie vehicles, but on a shorter, ex-[[National Coal Board]] four-wheel chassis. Carriage 21 and the partially built carriage 22 have been designed to appear as similar as possible to the original 19th Century bogie vehicles, but constructed to 21st Century safety standards. There are two more carriages planned which will be numbered 23 and 24.

When carriage 22 is completed the railway will be able to run an authentic-looking "1920s" train with the "Tattoo" loco and two bogie carriages.
