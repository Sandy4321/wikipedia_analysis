"'''Footprints in the Sand'''" is a song recorded by [[British people|British]] singer [[Leona Lewis]] for her debut studio album ''[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]'' (2007). It was written by [[Simon Cowell]], [[David Kreuger]], [[Per Magnusson]], [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]], and produced by [[Steve Mac]]. The song was digitally released as Lewis's third single on 9&nbsp;March&nbsp;2008 in the United Kingdom. [[Sony BMG]] and [[Syco|Syco Music]] launched it as a [[double A-side]] with "[[Better in Time]]", and "You Bring Me Down" as the B-side.

It is a [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] song composed with a tempo of sixty beats per minute. It was written in a period of one day at Page's home in [[Malibu, California]], with Cowell giving the idea to base it on the Christian poem "[[Footprints (poem)|Footprints]]". The single's music video was filmed by British director [[Sophie Muller]] in Johannesburg, South Africa. The video describes social problems within the city, but ends with a message of [[hope]]. "Footprints in the Sand" became the official theme of the 2008 version of biennial charity programme [[Sport Relief]], by [[BBC]].

The song received positive reviews from music critics, some of them noting its [[gospel music|gospel]] sounds and Lewis's vocals being compared to American R&B singer [[Mariah Carey]]. "Footprints in the Sand" charted as a separate single in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the [[European Hot 100 Singles]], whilst the double A-side appeared in Germany and Switzerland, and was certified silver in the UK by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), in 2008. In the same year, Lewis performed the song for the first time in the UK live on the television programme ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''. In 2009, the song was covered by [[List of The X Factor finalists (UK series 6)#Lucie Jones|Lucie Jones]], a contestant of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'', and by Julia Star from Swiss programme ''[[Got Talent|Die gr<U+00F6>ssten Schweizer Talente]]''.
