{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
The music of the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' was composed by [[Naoshi Mizuta]] along with regular series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] and [[Kumi Tanioka]]. The ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack'', a compilation of almost all of the music in the game, was released by [[DigiCube]] in 2002, and subsequently re-released by [[Square Enix]] in 2004. ''Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack'' was released by DigiCube in 2003 after the release of the ''Rise of the Zilart'' expansion for ''Final Fantasy XI'', and re-released by Square Enix in 2004. ''Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack'' was produced by Square Enix in 2004 after the release of the ''Chains of Promathia'' expansion, and in 2005 Square Enix published ''Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel'', a collection of [[arrangement|arranged]] tracks from the game performed by ''The Star Onions'', a group composed of Square Enix composers including Naoshi Mizuta, Kumi Tanioka and Hidenori Iwasaki. ''Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack'' was released by Square Enix in 2006 for the ''Treasures of Aht Urhgan'' expansion.  

In 2007, Square Enix released the ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box'', a collection of all of the previously released albums, as well as the as yet unreleased ''Final Fantasy XI Unreleased Tracks'' and ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'', an album of unreleased music from the game and its expansions and an album of [[piano]] arrangements of music from the game, respectively.  After the release of the fourth expansion for the game, ''Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess Original Soundtrack'' was released in 2008 by Square Enix. Additionally, in summer 2008 another ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'' album, completely separate from the previous piano collections album, will be released by Square Enix.

The music has received mixed reviews; while reviewers have praised some of the associated albums such as ''Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack'' and ''Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack'', other albums, such as ''Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack'' and ''Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel'', were not as universally liked. Several songs, especially "Distant Worlds", remain popular today, and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series, as well as been published in arranged and compilation albums by Square as well as outside groups.

==Creation and influence==
The music of ''Final Fantasy XI'' was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, Naoshi Mizuta, and Kumi Tanioka.<ref name="RPGFROTZ">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick| title=Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart OST | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff11-zilart/index.html | accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref> Composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]] was also asked to contribute, but he was busy scoring ''[[Xenosaga]]''.<ref name="esper">{{cite web |author=Van, Tim| title=Final Fantasy XI OST| publisher=[[RPGFan]] | date=2007-01-01| url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ff11/index.html | accessdate=2006-02-24}}</ref> The expansion packs were scored by Mizuta alone after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix, although their names remain in the credits for those albums due to the inclusion of versions of songs they had previously composed for the game. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in [[Esperanto]].<ref name="esper"/> According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. He also noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games. It was the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square employee.<ref>{{cite web |author=Fahey, Rob | title=Focus On: Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu| publisher=Gamesindustry.biz | date=2005-02-25 | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7033 | accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref> New music has been employed for special events, such as a holiday score titled ''Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-'' which can be heard in the city of Jeuno each mid to late December since 2004. Some of the game's music has been released on [[iTunes]] for download, such as the vocal "Distant Worlds", which was released on the Japanese iTunes Music Store on September 13, 2005, having been put in the game in a July 2005 patch.<ref>{{cite web |author=IGN Music| title=Final Fantasy Soundtracks| publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2005-05-10 | url=http://music.ign.com/articles/611/611637p1.html|accessdate=2006-08-15}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack'' received mixed reviews by critics, with Ben Schweitzer of [[RPGFan]] finding it to be a "strong" album, if "slower" and "more repetitive than previous Final Fantasy scores".<ref name="RPGFOST"/> Liz Maas of RPGFan enjoyed the album, advising any fan of the series, even if not of the game itself, to buy the album.<ref name="RPGFOST"/>  Joe Schwebke of Soundtrack Central, on the other hand, found it to be "a collection of bland melodies, dull chord progressions, and aged tapestries of musical technique" and, while praising the sound quality, termed it overall a "disappointment".<ref>{{cite web | author=Schwebke, Joe | title=Final Fantasy 11 Original Soundtrack | publisher=Soundtrack Central | date=2003-04-02| url=http://www.soundtrackcentral.com/cds/finalfantasy11_ost.htm | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> Chris of Square Enix Music Online, however, felt that while it was "not instantly likable" that it had "the potential to become a favorite with multiple listens".<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff11.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack'' was well received by critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, who called it "a solid OST" of "well-developed compositions".<ref name="RPGFROTZ"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online agreed, terming it "a very well-produced soundtrack" and "a consistent and fitting effort".<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Final Fantasy XI Rise of the Zilart Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff11zilart.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref>  Unlike the first expansion soundtrack, ''Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack'' was not received well by critics.  Patrick Gann expressed himself as "disappointed" and said that the album was full of "boring, repetitive string-work" instead of Mizuta's usual "strong, raw instrumentation".<ref name="RPGFCOP"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online termed it "the least accessible Final Fantasy XI soundtrack" and disliked its "grating synth use", but also termed it "an excellent in-game accompaniment".<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Final Fantasy XI Chains of Promathia Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff11promathia.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> ''Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel'' received widely varied reviews by critics.  Mike Wilson of RPGFan termed it a "high caliber soundtrack" and said that it was full of "extremely well done" tracks.<ref name="RPGFTSO"/> Ryan Mattich of RPGFan was slightly less impressed, saying that while "each track is a masterpiece", that the album as a whole lacked cohesion.<ref name="RPGFTSO"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online was much harsher towards the album, finding it to be "fundamentally flawed" due to a lack of coherence and disliked several of the tracks, especially the ones arranged by Mizuta.<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Final Fantasy XI - Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff11arr.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack'' was well received by critics, with Patrick Gann describing it as "wonderful", and saying that "nearly every song has its own memorable feel".<ref name="RPGFTOAU"/> Chris of Square Enix Music Online agreed, terming it "a solid mixture of continuity and change".<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | title=Final Fantasy XI Treasures of Aht Urhgan Original Soundtrack: Review by Chris | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/chris/ff11urhgan.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy XI Unreleased Tracks'' was well received by critics such as Patrick Gann, who said that it was an album full of "interesting pieces".<ref name="RPGFPB"/> The ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'' included with it in the ''Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box'' received varied reviews by critics. Patrick Gann termed it "excellent" and praised the technical skills of the performers, though he disliked the short length of the album.<ref name="RPGFPB"/> Jillian of Square Enix Music Online, on the other hand, was "disappointed" with the album, finding the arrangements to be "simplistic" and the performances, while good technically, to be lacking in passion.<ref>{{cite web | author=Jillian | title=Final Fantasy XI Premium Box Piano Collections: Review by Jillian | publisher=Square Enix Music Online | url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/reviews/jillian/ff11boxpc.shtml | accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> ''Final Fantasy XI Wings of the Goddess Original Soundtrack'' received mixed reviews from reviewers, with Patrick Gann saying that "It is consistently good, but rarely is it mind-blowing". He did, however, praise Mizuta, saying that "Mizuta has grown...to the point where I imagine he can take on nearly any project".<ref name="RPGFWOTG"/> ''Piano Collections Final Fantasy XI'' was well received by critics, with Patrick Gann praising its "high-quality arrangements, and extremely high-quality recording and production value".<ref name="RPGFPC2"/>
