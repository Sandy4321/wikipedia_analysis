'''Major League Soccer''' ('''MLS''') is a professional [[football (soccer)|soccer]] league with teams in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It is sanctioned by the professional divisions of both the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF or U.S. Soccer) and the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] (CSA), which are both members of [[FIFA]].  MLS represents the top tier in the [[American Soccer Pyramid]]. 

==Competition format==
[[Image:Mls cup.gif|thumb|The [[MLS Cup]].]]
The format for the [[Major League Soccer 2007 season|2007 season]] is as follows:
*Season runs from [[April]] [[2007]] to a championship match played [[November 18]], [[2007]].
*13 clubs split into two conferences: the Western Conference will have six clubs, while the Eastern Conference will have seven, including the league's newest addition, [[Toronto FC]].  Each club plays 30 games, evenly divided among home and away matches.  Each club will play every other club twice, home and away, for a total of 24 games.  The remaining 6 games will all be intra-conference, with each club playing its fellow conference members an additional game.  In the Western Conference, an additional game will be added to the above, highlighting a local or regional rivalry (Los Angeles vs. Chivas USA, Houston vs. FC Dallas, Salt Lake vs. Colorado).
*At season's end, the top two clubs of each conference will make the playoffs; in addition, the next four highest point totals, regardless of conference, will also be in the playoffs.  In the event that a team which finishes fifth or lower in their conference qualifies, that team will be placed in the other conference's playoff bracket.  In the first round of this knockout tournament, aggregate goals over two matches determine the winners; the Conference Championships are one match each, with the winner of each conference advancing to [[MLS Cup]].  In all rounds, draws will be broken with 2 15-minute periods of extra time, followed by penalty kicks if necessary.  The [[away goals rule]] is not used.
*The MLS Champion (winner of MLS Cup) qualifies for the next [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]].  Furthermore, the club with the best record in the 30 game regular season wins the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] and also qualifies for the CONCACAF Champions' Cup.  If the Supporters' Shield winner wins the [[MLS Cup]], the runner-up to the Supporters Shield is the second qualifier.
*The two MLS clubs that qualify for the CONCACAF Champions' Cup have the ability to qualify for [[Copa Sudamericana]] if they make the final, and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] if they win the championship.  If an MLS club were to win Copa Sudamericana they would also play in [[Recopa Sudamericana]].
*During the season, all MLS clubs may also compete in the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] (except Toronto), select international tournaments, and various exhibitions.
*[[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]], a new MLS-[[Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n de M<U+00E9>xico]] club competition, will also make up the 2007 season schedule, with most matches occurring midweek in July and August.  FC Dallas, Los Angeles Galaxy, DC United and Houston Dynamo are expected to play at least three matches each.

==History==
{{Expand|date=April 2007}}
{{MLS Labelled Map}}
MLS was formed on [[December 17]], [[1993]], in fulfillment of [[Alan Rothenberg]] and the US Soccer Federation's promise to [[FIFA]] to establish a "Division One" professional football (soccer) league in exchange for the staging of the [[Football World Cup 1994|FIFA World Cup USA 1994]] in the United States. The league began play in [[1996 Major League Soccer season|1996]] with ten clubs and enjoyed promising attendance numbers in its first season. Numbers declined slightly after the first year, but have increased in subsequent years. The original 10 clubs were divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference ([[Columbus Crew]], [[D.C. United]], [[New England Revolution]], [[MetroStars|NY/NJ MetroStars]], and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny]]), and Western Conference ([[Colorado Rapids]], [[FC Dallas|Dallas Burn]], [[Kansas City Wizards|Kansas City Wiz]], [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and [[San Jose Earthquakes|San Jose Clash]]).

===Early years===
The league was greeted with indifference by the American mainstream as the 1994 World Cup in the United States faded from memory.  The early years gave rise to the [[Bruce Arena]]-led dynasty of DC United, a championship team in three of the league's first four seasons.  It took the expansion [[Chicago Fire (soccer)|Chicago Fire]] in 1998 to end United's stranglehold on MLS Cup, the championship game which featured several players that would prove to have an impact on MLS and American soccer.

For most of MLS' early years, the league played to sparsely-attended crowds.  The [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] in [[France]] saw the [[United States men's national soccer team]], largely made up of American MLS players, eliminated from the first round and in last place among the 32 participating countries, casting doubt on the level of play in the American domestic league.  Some of the survivors of the 1998 roster would, however, join new and upcoming players in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].  The league began to market itself on the talents of American players, experienced veterans and fresh talents alike.  The likes of [[DaMarcus Beasley]] and [[Landon Donovan]] were making names for themselves in Major League Soccer, while players like [[Brian McBride]] and [[Clint Mathis]] continued to prove their worth to their domestic and national teams.

The league's finances hit rock bottom in 1998{{Fact|date=June 2007}}, however, with the league overall losing some 34 million dollars, leading to the departure of then MLS Commissioner Doug Logan in favor of former NFL International head Don Garber, whose leadership would later prove to be instrumental in securing the league's future.  In the front office, construction of new "soccer-specific" stadiums for the league's teams, largely financed by the benefactors in [[Lamar Hunt]] and [[Phil Anschutz]] became the policy for the league's survival, following the model laid down by Lamar Hunt through the construction of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]] in 1999.

On the field, the early wave of international players that had joined MLS at its inception drifted into retirement or moved on to other teams around the world.  The run up to the World Cup in 2002 would see a gradual shift in league philosophy towards the development of American talent, and would eventually prove beneficial to American soccer.  Donovan, who was loaned from German club [[Bayer Leverkusen]] to the [[San Jose Earthquakes]], had an immediate impact with the team, scoring a goal in the 2001 MLS Cup to force overtime in their eventual championship win over the Los Angeles Galaxy.

===Resurgence===
The World Cup in [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], in which the United States unexpectedly made the quarterfinal round based on wins against [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]], saw a resurgence in American soccer and in MLS.  The 2002 MLS Cup, held four months after the World Cup final, set the championship attendance record with a sellout crowd at [[Gillette Stadium]] that saw the Los Angeles Galaxy win their first title.  From 2001, both Los Angeles and the San Jose Earthquakes would hoist the trophy twice, while DC United returned to prominence in the 2004 MLS Cup, in the aftermath of an exciting Eastern Conference Championship against the [[New England Revolution]].  That year would also witness the professional debut of [[Freddy Adu]], who entered the league with much fanfare and heralded as one of the top prospects in the United States.

The years leading up to the next World Cup in [[Germany]] marked significant transition in MLS.  A league that had marketed itself on the talent of American players saw some of its best and brightest leave for more prominent leagues in Europe.  [[Tim Howard]], goalkeeper for the [[MetroStars]], was sent to [[Manchester United]] for one of the most lucrative contracts in league history.  DaMarcus Beasley of the Chicago Fire went to [[Holland]], while Landon Donovan, on loan from [[Bayer Leverkusen]], was recalled back to Germany.  Donovan's rather brief stint with the team was quickly aborted, resulting in a trade back to MLS, this time with the Los Angeles Galaxy prior to start of the 2005 season.  Donovan would then go on to lead the Galaxy to its second MLS Cup in 2005.

Other American players who did not factor for the national team would, however, make an impact for their respective MLS teams.  [[Jason Kreis]] of the expansion [[Real Salt Lake]] became the first player in MLS history to score at least 100 league goals in 2005.  In Kansas City, goalkeeper [[Bo Oshoniyi]] took the place of injured [[Tony Meola]] and helped the [[Kansas City Wizards|Wizards]] return to MLS Cup in 2004, with the team nearly clinching a playoff berth one season later.  [[Herculez Gomez]] made a name for himself playing with the Galaxy in his first three seasons in MLS, scoring the game-winning goal in the 2005 US Open Cup final.  In 2005, the MLS also created its [[MLS Reserve Division|Reserve Division]], with each team's reserve squad playing 12 games, helping to provide valuable playing time to develop non-starters on the team roster.  The DC United Reserves won the first Reserve Division title in 2005.

===2006-present===
The 2006 season confirmed Major League Soccer as a stable product of both American and international soccer.  [[Piotr Nowak]], once a [[Chicago Fire]] player, managed the All-Star team to a win in the 2006 All-Star Game over [[Chelsea F.C.]], while former-Liverpool player [[Steve Nicol]] led his team to MLS Cup for the third time in five years.  [[Bob Bradley]], whose reputation was scarred by underwhelming results when coaching the [[MetroStars]], turned around the second-year [[Chivas USA]], who in their inaugural season finished last among all teams in the league.  Among players, [[Jaime Moreno]] continued to display his veteran experience, while [[Christian Gomez]] and [[Dwayne De Rosario]] excelled for [[DC United]] and [[Houston Dynamo]], respectively.  The Dynamo, once the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the season prior, took the championship in their first season in Houston.  The title game featured names familiar to many American soccer fans; [[Taylor Twellman]] scored for the first time in three championship games in overtime, while [[Brian Ching]] scored the equalizer only moments later, sending the game into a penalty kick shootout where goalkeeper [[Pat Onstad]] secured the win for [[Houston Dynamo]].

The 2007 season will see fans greet familiar faces, namely in the MLS debut of [[David Beckham]], whose signing has been seen as a coup for American soccer.  David Beckham's signing by the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] was made possible by the [[Designated Player Rule]].  He has been followed by three more designated players, including [[Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Blanco]] to the [[Chicago Fire (soccer)|Chicago Fire]], and [[Claudio Reyna]] and [[Juan Pablo <U+00C1>ngel]] to the [[New York Red Bulls]].  The Red Bulls' use of two designated players has boosted the club tremendously, with both players already improving the team's on-field performance considerably (Red Bulls are 2nd in the league in total points, behind the Kansas City Wizards).  The departure of [[Clint Dempsey]] to [[Fulham]], and the New York Red Bulls' debut of former United States captain Claudio Reyna, highlights an exchange of top prospects to Europe for experienced veterans to the United States.  Several other well-known foreign players have followed Beckham and other designated players to MLS for the 2007 season, including [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]] (to [[Columbus Crew|Columbus]]), [[Luciano Emilio]] (to [[DC United|D.C.]]), Ronald Waterreus (to [[New York Red Bulls|New York]]), and [[Abel Xavier]] (to [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]).<ref>{{cite news

The biggest surprise of the 2007 season has been the underwhelming performances of both MLS Cup winners Houston Dynamo and Supporters' Shield winners DC United.  Poor starts to the season for the league's once-considered elite teams have contrasted with strong performances by the likes of FC Dallas and the New York Red Bulls.  Toronto FC, the league's newest addition, became the last team in the league to earn a point or score a goal in the 2007 season, until sellout crowds at their new BMO Field helped propel them to two straight victories.  In the Western Conference, Dallas and the Colorado Rapids have led the way, ahead of a weak field of teams, including both Los Angeles franchises and Real Salt Lake, the last team in the league to notch a win this season.

==Organization==
Major League Soccer has been known more for its front office and management dealings than its on-field product [http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/latest_soccer_news/533352.html].  In the off-season, expansion, contraction and rebranding have become buzzwords for the league and its fans.  Recently the league has started to focus on improving the quality of play its teams produces on the field via new rules like the [[Designated Player Rule]] and through the creation of a league-wide youth development system [http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_events_news.jsp?ymd=20061110&content_id=78269&vkey=mlscuppr2006&fext=.jsp].  

==="Game First"===
The 2007 MLS offseason is considered by some to be its most productive [http://sport.monstersandcritics.com/soccer/article_1300505.php/MLS_comes_out_of_the_gates_strong_in_07], and there have been a number of positive changes for the league, bringing about a slow rise in its standings both financially and athletically.  The league announced a youth development initiative [http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_events_news.jsp?ymd=20061110&content_id=78269&vkey=mlscuppr2006&fext=.jsp], which will require youth development teams for all the league's teams, which will help the league develop "home-grown" talent on its own.  The hope is that by being able to sign up to 2 of its own youth players to the senior team each year that the league's teams will have an incentive to improve the quality and talent pool of the league organically and also benefit from the transfer fees they may bring.  Perhaps the first example of a success in "home-grown" talent development is the New York Red Bulls' [[Josmer Altidore]], who has risen to prominence as one of the league's most skilled young strikers.  

Furthering the development of the league was the decision to create the [[Designated Player Rule]], which allows for a league team to pay up to two players a salary beyond that covered in the salary cap at their own expense.  Following David Beckham to MLS are a host of veteran players, including Claudio Reyna, Juan Pablo Angel, and Cuauht<U+00E9>moc Blanco.  Following the creation of the Designated Player Rule, the league announced in conjunction with the La Primera Divisi<U+00F3>n del Futbol Mexicano (Mexican First Division) that it would be creating a tournament called Superliga, which would start in 2007, with 4 teams from MLS and 4 from Mexico competing for a 1 million dollar prize to become the champions of [[North America]]n club soccer[http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070113&content_id=81815&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp].  These matches will initially only be covered in Spanish by Univision and Telefutura.  Currently an english broadcaster has not signed to cover the tournament yet, although if its debut is a success this scenario may not last long.  

Following these announcements the league announced "Game-First", a series of initiatives aimed at improving the league in a myriad of ways, one of the most immediate being the hiring of the first full-time professional referees in league history [http://web.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070402&content_id=87043&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp].  

===Expansion, contraction and relocation===
After starting with 10 clubs, the league expanded to 12 clubs in [[1998 Major League Soccer season|1998]], adding the [[Chicago Fire (soccer)|Chicago Fire]] and [[Miami Fusion]].  However, following the [[2001 Major League Soccer season|2001]] season, [[Miami]] and [[Tampa Bay]] were disbanded and the league contracted back to ten clubs.

Following the [[2004 Major League Soccer season|2004]] season, the league expanded again, adding [[Real Salt Lake]], located in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] and [[Chivas USA]], which shares [[The Home Depot Center]] with the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]. The two new clubs were placed in the Western Conference, with [[Kansas City Wizards|Kansas City]] moving to the East.

Following the conclusion of the [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]] season, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] were relocated to [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and renamed [[Houston Dynamo]]. However, the Earthquakes' name and history were not transferred, with the possibility of an expansion club returning to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] as early as 2008; [[Houston]] is considered an expansion club.

MLS added [[Toronto FC]] for the [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]] season with the plan to have three more expansion clubs by 2010.  Other current possibilities include the planned 2008 return to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]],<ref>[http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20060524&content_id=60098&vkey=pr_mls&fext=.jsp Oakland A's ownership group purchases option to bring Major League Soccer back to Bay Area]; [http://www.mlsnet.com/MLS/mls/about/sje.jsp ''Dear Earthquakes fans...'']</ref> or expansion to [[Las Vegas]],<ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/sun/2007/may/09/566684655.html Soccer goal: Play big, play pro in Vegas</ref> [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]],<ref>[http://www.neoprosoccer.com Cleveland Expansion: NEO Pro Soccer]; [http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/summit/1147509811181800.xml&coll=2 Real estate fee hike could pay for stadium]; [http://3rddegree.matchnight.com/thirdindex.cfm?page=article&show=19015 Meeting the Don: Notes on a Media Round Table]</ref> [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]],<ref>[http://3rddegree.matchnight.com/thirdindex.cfm?page=article&show=19015 Meeting the Don: Notes on a Media Round Table]</ref> [[Philadelphia]],<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/sports/MLS_remains_eager_for_Philly_team.html MLS remains eager for Philly team]</ref> [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]],<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/sports/1175054138185400.xml&coll=7 MLS takes a look at Portland]</ref> or [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/othersports/314090_mls03.html Seattle back on MLS burner]</ref>.

===Club names===
''For more information on MLS club names, see the individual club's entries.''

Originally in the style of other US sports, the clubs were given nicknames at their creation such as the Columbus Crew.  DC United and Miami Fusion FC were the two exceptions that adopted more traditional names.  However, new teams, such as  Real Salt Lake and Toronto FC, have been adopting names similar to popular European clubs. In addition, other established clubs like Dallas and New York have changed their club names to reflect a more [[Europe|"European"]] nature.

===Stadiums===
<!--FOR THE LAST TIME, the plural of stadium is BOTH stadiums and stadia.  This article is based on a sports league in America, and American English more commonly uses "stadiums." Please consult WP:ENGVAR if your aversion to American English is THAT strong. -Roehl Sybing -->
[[Image:revsgame.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Gillette Stadium]], home of the [[New England Revolution]].]]

When the league was started, most clubs played in stadiums built specifically for [[National Football League|NFL]] or [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] (college) [[American football]]. This was based on the record attendances achieved at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. However this turned out to be a considerable expense to the league because of modest attendance and poor lease deals. To provide better facilities as well as to control revenue for the stadium, a major goal of MLS management is to build its own stadiums, which are often called [[soccer-specific stadium]]s.

Since 1999, the league has seen the construction and completion of six venues specifically tailored for soccer.  [[Lamar Hunt]] broke new ground in this endeavor by financing the construction of [[Columbus Crew Stadium]].  The [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] followed four years later with the opening of [[The Home Depot Center]] in [[2003 Major League Soccer season|2003]].  The new venue played host to two consecutive MLS Cups, until [[FC Dallas]]' [[Pizza Hut Park]] opened in [[2005 Major League Soccer season|2005]] and hosted the next two championships.  [[Chicago Fire]] began playing their home games in [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in [[2006 Major League Soccer season|2006]], a venue that witnessed the MLS All-Stars defeating [[Chelsea F.C.]] in the All-Star Game, and a US Open Cup championship for the Fire in their first season in the stadium.  [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]] saw the opening of [[Dick's Sporting Goods Park]] for the [[Colorado Rapids]], and [[BMO Field]] for the expansion [[Toronto FC]].

[[Image:PHP 2005.jpg|left|250 px|thumb|[[Pizza Hut Park]], home of [[F.C. Dallas]].]]

Future plans include new venues for [[Red Bull New York]] and [[Real Salt Lake]] by [[2008 Major League Soccer season|2008]], while [[DC United]] and the [[Kansas City Wizards]] are actively searching for ways to finance and build their respective stadiums.

The move to soccer-specific stadiums has been seen by many as essential to building up attendance and fan support for MLS. So far, every club that has built its own stadium has not only seen its game attendance rise, but also has helped MLS to come closer to the ultimate goal of profitability. Thanks to their new stadium, the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] became the first club to make a profit, and were followed in 2006 by [[FC Dallas]].  With the league's new TV rights for the 2007 season, several more clubs are projected to be profitable.

Other MLS teams will, in the foreseeable future, continue to play in larger stadiums designed for football.  The [[New England Revolution]] play in [[Gillette Stadium]], whose primary tenant is the NFL's [[New England Patriots]], and [[Houston Dynamo]] play in [[Robertson Stadium]] on the campus of the [[University of Houston]].  Both teams have expressed interest in securing their own soccer-specific stadiums.

===Media coverage===

At the outset, MLS signed deals for coverage on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], while Univision broadcast matches in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The original Univision deal lapsed after a few years, leaving only the ABC/ESPN family of networks as the league's national broadcasters.  Fox Sports World (later rebranded as [[Fox Soccer Channel]] in 2005), [[Fox Sports en Espa<U+00F1>ol]] and [[HDNet]] began airing matches in 2003.

A new deal was reached with the [[Walt Disney Corporation]] in 2006, the parent company of ABC and ESPN, who became responsible for the production and promotion of their Thursday night telecasts of MLS matches.  Univision and its family of networks resumed MLS broadcasts in 2007 as well, with most matches airing on [[Telefutura]] and [[Galavision]] on Sunday afternoons and evenings.

With the addition of Toronto FC, coverage of MLS expanded into Canada in 2007.  The [[CBC Television|CBC]], [[The Score Television Network|The Score]] and [[Rogers Sportsnet]] all have agreed to cover MLS matches featuring Toronto FC. 

The league's [[MLS Direct Kick]] package, which broadcasts out-of-market matches, has been expanded to ensure that every league match is broadcast.

===Profitability===
Major League Soccer has lost more than $350 million since its founding, according to a report by ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' in [[2004]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_47/b3909099.htm?campaign_id=search Soccer: Time To Kick It Up A Notch.]</ref> but some signs are positive.  As soccer-specific stadiums are built, ownership expands and television coverage increases, MLS has managed to see their revenues increase while costs are kept to a minimum.  The 2003 season saw the Los Angeles Galaxy make a profit in their first season at the Home Depot Center, while FC Dallas turned a profit in a similar fashion after moving into Pizza Hut Park in 2005.

Television coverage has consistently expanded throughout the league's history, with MLS brokering a deal with [[ESPN]] in 2006 for rights fees and greater presence across its networks.  2007 will also see a return of MLS to [[Univision]] and its Spanish-language networks.  They will join [[Fox Soccer Channel]] and [[HDNet]] as MLS' national outlets, while the league has mandated that every league game receive television coverage, if not nationally, then by at least locally in one of the two teams' cities.

In 2007, MLS started selling ad space on the front of jerseys to go along with the league-wide sponsorship partners who are already advertising on the back of club jerseys, following the practice of international soccer  [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06271/725842-28.stm].  The league has established a floor of $500,000 per shirt sponsorship, with the league receiving a flat fee of $200,000 per deal.  When Red Bull purchased the New York club, their deal included an agreement to have the Red Bull logo on the front of the team's jerseys. In 2007, Real Salt Lake was the first to feature a sponsor, XanGo, a nutritional supplement juice. Quickly following that were deals between L.A. Galaxy and Herbalife,  Toronto FC and BMO and  as well as Chivas USA and Comex. 

MLS Commissioner Don Garber said on May 11, 2006<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/sports/20060511-120809-9655r.htm MLS:Franchises to profit by 2010]</ref> that he expects the league's clubs to be profitable by 2010 overall, saying that FC Dallas and LA Galaxy clubs are already profitable, with several other clubs nearing profitability according to earlier remarks: the Chicago Fire and New England Revolution.

Recently there have been some potential investors expressing reservations about the MLS leaderships' decisions on bringing in designated players and the raised franchise fee.  One such potential MLS investor is Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanaue, who was quoted by ESPN: "But at this point to me the franchise fee has gone up to $30 million, plus there is the expectation of a stadium being built so it will cost someone another $30 million. So you're up to $60 million and you're going to lose money operationally.  Operational costs and start-up costs are what's holding us back, that is fair to say. We have been looking for partners to do it with, but I won't do it alone." [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=416868&cc=5901]  

"Underlying the concerns of potential investors such as Mandaric and Hanauer is the belief that while there is good reason to be excited, money is still being lost. Beckham will count for nothing if crowds and viewing figures don't increase when the Galaxy aren't in town, or if his era doesn't produce the first crop of U.S. superstars."-ESPN's Andrew Rogers

Others, like FC Dallas President & General Manager Michael Hitchcock, while accepting the validity of the concerns, disagree on the future outlook of the league's finances, quote, "We still have some teams losing money," he said. "But the positive thing is they are not losing lots of money because of our single entity structure. Expense on some levels are shared and revenues on some levels are shared.  The losses are going down every year for the league. The financials for the league and the individual clubs are becoming more and more positive. We have a slow growth model and key to this is developing the American player and not wanting to dilute the product, which other leagues in the U.S. have done and made the mistake of expanding too quickly."  [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/feature?id=416868&cc=5901]

===Ownership===
MLS operates under a single-entity structure in which teams are centrally controlled by the league.  In order to keep costs under control, revenues are shared amongst the league, and player contracts are negotiated by the league.

Some critics have regularly alleged that the league showed preferential treatment to big-market or profitable clubs with regards to player allocation and the salary cap. The league also fought a bitter legal battle with its players over its economic system, but this was eventually resolved with the players gaining some improved benefits in return for accepting the single entity structure. A court had also ruled that even absent their [[collective bargaining agreement]], players could opt to play in other leagues if they were unsatisfied.

The league's controlled costs have attracted new ownership that can put more money into the league and improve it by focusing their money and attention on fewer clubs.  Examples include the [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]]'s sale of the MetroStars to [[Red Bull]], "in excess of $100 million," according to the New York Times.  MLS Commissioner Garber said to the Los Angeles Times that "the sale was part of a plan to have AEG decrease its holdings in MLS. We're pushing [[Lamar Hunt#Major League Soccer|Hunt Sports]] to do the same thing."

It appears that Commissioner Garber and MLS management has said it is pushing these changes as part of a new ownership strategy, one in which each owner has a single club, and is better able to focus their resources upon that club, as with the owners of the New York Red Bulls and Real Salt Lake.  Commissioner Garber has stated that having multiple clubs owned by a single owner was a necessity in the first 10 years of MLS, but now that the league appears to be on the brink of overall profitability and has significant expansion plans, he wants each club to have its own owner.  

In order to help bring this about, the league is now giving more incentive to be an individual club owner, with all owners now having the rights to any player they develop through their club's academy system, sharing the profits of [[Soccer United Marketing]], MLS' media and marketing arm, and now for the first time, allowing owners to have individual club jersey sponsors, with the approval of the league office.

AEG, at one time, owned six teams in MLS, and have since sold the Colorado Rapids, MetroStars and DC United to new owners.  AEG's remaining teams are the Los Angeles Galaxy, the Chicago Fire, and the Houston Dynamo.  The other major owner-investor in MLS is the [[Lamar Hunt#Major League Soccer|Hunt Sports]], which owns the Columbus Crew and FC Dallas, having sold the Kansas City Wizards in 2006 to a local ownership group.

With the sale of DC United in 2007, the league now has 10 owners for their 13 clubs.

===Rule changes===
MLS experimented with rule changes in its early years, although some of these had been used in the [[North American Soccer League|NASL]] and remain in effect for high school and college soccer. The clock, which counts up in international soccer, would instead count down and would stop on dead ball situations at the referee's discretion (especially after injuries). Once the clock hit 0:00, the half would be over. The other major change was the inception of "shootouts" to resolve tie games. If the game ended in a draw, a situation similar to a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] would ensue. A shootout attempt consisted of a player getting the ball 35 yards from the goal with five seconds to put it past the goalkeeper. Just like with penalty kicks, it was a best-of-five competition; if the score was still tied, the tiebreaker would head to an extra frame. The club that won the shootout would get one standings point (as opposed to three for the regulation win), the losing club zero.

MLS also featured a fourth "goalkeeper only" substitute until the end of the 2003 season when MetroStars coach [[Bob Bradley]] used a loophole in the rule to insert [[Eddie Gaven]] as an extra fourth field player substitute.

The rule changes, especially the shootout, failed to bring in a wider American audience and alienated some traditional fans. The shootout was eliminated after the 1999 season and the upward-counting clock (with added time at the referee's discretion) came into use in 2000. MLS experimented in settling tie games with [[golden goal]] [[overtime (sport)|overtime]] periods from 2000 to 2004 similar to those in college soccer (in MLS, the tie would stand if no club scored after ten minutes, rather than twenty minutes in college, and each club would get one point). Regular season overtime was phased out after the 2003 season, while starting in 2005 the playoff overtime rules were synchronized with new FIFA rules calling for a pair of fifteen minute, non-golden goal overtimes, followed by penalty kicks if necessary.

From 1996 to 2004, MLS playoff games did feature golden goals if a tie needed to be broken.  Golden goals were scored in the 1996, 2001 and 2002 MLS Cups by D.C. United, San Jose Earthquakes and Los Angeles Galaxy, respectively.
