'''Club Deportivo Chivas USA''' is an American professional [[Association football|soccer]] club located in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Carson, California]], originally a subsidiary of the Mexican club [[C.D. Guadalajara]],<ref>[http://blogs.mediotiempo.com/futbolteca/2013/03/01/el-noveno-proyecto-de-chivas-usa/ El noveno proyecto de Chivas USA (Spanish)]</ref> which competes in [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS).

The club became the eleventh MLS team upon its entry into the league in 2004. Chivas USA was intended to be seen as a "little brother" to its parent club C.D. Guadalajara, one of the most widely supported and successful teams in Mexico. In Spanish, ''chivas'' means "[[goat]]s", and is the nickname of C.D. Guadalajara.

Chivas USA plays its home games at the [[StubHub Center]] in Carson, which it shares with its rival, the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]. The club was originally owned by [[Jorge Vergara]], who also owns C.D. Guadalajara; in 2014, MLS purchased the club from Vergara with plans to sell it to new owners, who will rebrand the club in time for the 2015 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/02/20/major-league-soccer-purchases-chivas-usa|title=Major League Soccer purchases Chivas USA|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}</ref>

==History==
Founded on August 2, 2004, as Major League Soccer's then-eleventh team, Los Angeles-based Club Deportivo Chivas USA has achieved some success in MLS. In 2007, the Mexican-owned club finished first in the [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference]], qualifying for the [[Major League Soccer 2007 season|playoffs]] for the second year in a row.

===The Beginning and early success (2005-2009)===
In 2005, Chivas USA kicked off its inaugural season in [[Major League Soccer]] at [[The Home Depot Center]] with a 2-0 loss to then [[MLS Cup]] Champions [[D.C. United]] on April 2, 2005, under the guidance of Chivas USA's first head coach [[Thomas Rongen]]. After a 1<U+2013>8<U+2013>1 start (their sole win coming against fellow expansion club [[Real Salt Lake]]), Thomas Rongen was named Chivas USA's sporting director and assistant coach Javier Ledesma became the club's interim head coach. On June 3, 2005, [[Hans Westerhof]] was named Chivas USA's second head coach. After a disappointing season, Westerhof did not return to coach the team in 2006.

On November 23, 2005, former [[MLS Coach of the Year]] [[Bob Bradley]] became Chivas USA's third head coach, replacing Hans Westerhof. Under Bradley, the [[Major League Soccer 2006 season|2006 season]] saw a major turnaround for Chivas USA. The team finished the 2006 season with a 10-9-13 record and earned a spot in the Western Conference playoffs. Bradley was named [[MLS Coach of the Year Award|MLS Coach of the Year]], becoming the first two-time winner of the award and Chivas USA defender [[Jonathan Bornstein]] was named [[MLS Rookie of the Year Award|2006 Gatorade Rookie of the Year]]. After the season ended, Coach Bradley was named interim head coach of the [[US men's national soccer team]] and head coach of the U.S. men's Olympic soccer team by the [[U.S. Soccer Federation]], and was replaced by Chivas USA's fourth head coach, [[Preki|Predrag "Preki" Radosavljevic]].

[[File:SKljestan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sacha Kljestan]] played a major role for Chivas USA from 2006-2010]]
The team's third season, under Preki, was the most successful to date. Chivas USA goalkeeper [[Brad Guzan]] was named [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award|MLS's Goalkeeper of the Year]] for the 2007 season. On November 7, 2007, Preki was named MLS Coach of the Year for 2007 after the first-year manager led the Red-and-White to a 15-7-8 record and first place in Major League Soccer's Western Conference. In January 2008, Preki signed a multi-year contract with Chivas USA securing his position as head coach for the 2008 season. Chivas finished the 2007 MLS season atop of the Western Conference. However, they lost in the Conference Semifinals of the [[MLS Cup 2007]] playoffs to the [[Kansas City Wizards]], who were the conference's No.&nbsp;4 seed under new MLS seeding rules despite being in the Eastern Conference.

In 2008 Chivas USA competed in their first official international tournament, playing [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] in the [[North American SuperLiga|2008 SuperLiga]]. [[Jonathan Bornstein]] and [[Sacha Kljestan]] were named to the [[MLS All-Star]] team. Goalie Brad Guzan became the first Goat to transfer to a European first division club. The Red-and-White clinched a playoff berth for the third consecutive season, losing to [[Real Salt Lake]] in the first round. Kljestan scored the U.S. Soccer Goal of the Year while playing in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]]. He was also named to the MLS Best XI, and was selected as U.S. Soccer's Young Male Athlete of the Year.

Jonathan Bornstein and Sacha Kljestan competed with the U.S. National Team in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. Chivas USA goalkeeper [[Zach Thornton]] was named to the <U+00AD>2009 MLS All-Star Team. Chivas USA announced the Team Award Winners, naming Thornton the team's Most Valuable Player. Thornton was also named the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year and MLS Comeback Player of the Year, and he was nominated to the MLS Best 11.

===Club struggles 2010<U+2013>===
[[Mart<U+00ED>n V<U+00E1>squez]] was named the team's head coach after serving as an assistant coach from 2005-2007. Kljestan and Bornstein were named co-captains for the 2010 season. During the World Cup break Kljestan signed a deal with Belgian club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], leaving Chivas USA after parts of five seasons. Bornstein played in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], starting in two matches for the [[US men's national soccer team|United States]] as they made it to the Round of 16. On October 27, the team released head coach [[Mart<U+00ED>n V<U+00E1>squez]] from his contract. On November 2, president and CEO Shawn Hunter announced he was stepping down. On December 14 the club's vice president of soccer operations, Stephen Hamilton revealed he too, was leaving his post. Both he and Hunter will continue to serve in advisory roles for the club. After Hamilton stepped down, Jose L Domene was named Interim General Manager. On January 4, 2011, Robin Fraser became Head coach of Chivas USA.

On August 29, 2012, Vergara and his wife, Ang<U+00E9>lica Fuentes, became sole owners of the club, buying out former partners Antonio and Lorenzo Cu<U+00E9>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/08/29/vergara-fuentes-become-sole-owners-chivas-usa |title=Vergara, Fuentes become sole owners of Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref> In a discrimination lawsuit filed on May 29, 2013 by dismissed non-Latino youth coaches [[Dan Calichman]] and [[Ted Chronopoulos]], shortly after the acquisition Vergara is alleged to have told his staff that those who did not speak Spanish would be fired, with Jose David, the team's new president and chief business officer, asking Chronopoulos for a list of youth players and coaches who were Mexican or Mexican American and of those that weren't.<ref name="Baxter">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-mls-chivas-usa-20130530,0,1160192.story|title=When will MLS save Chivas USA from itself?|last=Baxter|first=Kevin|date=May 30, 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref>  The lawsuit was the subject of the lead segment of the July 23, 2013 broadcast of [[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]. After the release of Preki, Chivas USA have failed to stay consistent on and off the pitch, just like its parent club, [[CD Guadalajara]], Chivas USA have had four coaches since the start of the 2010 season in which all four coaches failed to impress Jorge Vergara.

On February 20, 2014, Major League Soccer purchased Chivas USA from Vergara. They announced plans to sell to a buyer dedicated to keeping the club in Los Angeles, as well as a plan to rebrand the club in time for the 2015 MLS season.<ref>{{cite web|author=MLS Communications |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2014/02/20/major-league-soccer-purchases-chivas-usa |title=Major League Soccer purchases Chivas USA |publisher=MLSsoccer.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Colors and badge==
Chivas USA's home uniform mirrors that of their parent club, [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]], with a red-and-white striped shirt, blue shorts and blue socks. Chivas USA has worn a variation of this kit since its inception (with slight variations in trim, stripe width, number of stripes, and other minor details), and usually complement this with a dark blue away uniform.

The club badge is also virtually identical to that of Guadalajara, featuring the shield of the city of [[Guadalajara]], but omitting the eleven stars (representing the eleven league titles won by Guadalajara) around the outside of the logo.

==Stadium==

*[[Titan Stadium (Cal State Fullerton)|Titan Stadium]]; [[Fullerton, California]] (2008, 2010) 2 games in US Open Cup and North American SuperLiga

Chivas USA plays its home games at [[Stubhub Center]],  on the campus of [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] in [[Carson, California]], approximately 10 miles south of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. The venue's title sponsor is online ticket retailer [[StubHub]].  Built in 2003 as the home stadium for [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], the "HDC" is a 27,000-seat [[soccer-specific stadium]], the second of its kind in MLS,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homedepotcenter.com/contentright.php?section=aboutus&page=thehdc |title=HomeDepot Center &#124; About Us |publisher=The Home Depot Center |date= |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}</ref> but has hosted other sports such as rugby and football.  Since they began play in 2005, ''Los Rojiblancos'' have shared the stadium the ''[[Los Angeles Galaxy|Los Galacticos]]'', with whom they compete for the [[Honda SuperClasico]].  This arrangement and those of the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[New York Giants]] and [[New York Jets]] in [[MetLife Stadium]] and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] in the [[Staples Center]] are the only cases in the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] of two teams of the same league sharing a venue.

Chivas USA have occasionally held home games at [[Titan Stadium (Cal State Fullerton)|Titan Stadium]] on the campus of [[California State University, Fullerton]], and at [[Harder Stadium]] on the campus of [[UC Santa Barbara]], such as in the [[US Open Cup]] when both they and [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] have been drawn to play at home on the same day, but this is generally a rare occurrence.

==Club culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

===Supporters groups===
The Union Ultras is the first Chivas USA [[supporters group]], boasting over 150 members that exclusively support Chivas USA.  They sit behind the goal in Section 101. The Union Ultras support Chivas USA exclusively, as opposed to Chivas de Guadalajara and therefore Chivas USA by default.

Black Army 1850 is the newest Chivas USA [[supporters group]], started during the 2010 season and sit in section 138. They have a membership between 50-60 members. They do not wear the traditional Chivas USA colors, red and white. The Black Army follows some of the protocol of European Ultras, not wearing their teams colors and instead wearing black. They identify with 1850 because that is the year California and Los Angeles became officially part of the United States as a state and city. The group strives to make Chivas USA a more regional team by identifying with Los Angeles.

===Sponsorship===
On May 16, 2007, [[Comex]], Mexico's leading paint company, became Chivas USA's first presenting sponsor, with their name on the front of the jerseys. At the opening of the 2010 season, the team's jerseys were blank.  On April 1, 2010, the new presenting sponsor, [[Grupo Modelo#Extra|Extra]],<ref name="eluniversal1">http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=23023&tabla=miami</ref> was finally unveiled prior to the match against rivals [[Los Angeles Galaxy]]; Extra is a Mexican convenience store chain owned by [[Grupo Modelo]], the makers of Corona beer.<ref name="eluniversal1"/><ref name="Chivas USA Public Relations">{{cite web|author=Chivas USA Public Relations |url=http://www.cdchivasusa.com/news/2010/04/notes-april-1-vs-galaxy |title=Notes from April 1 vs. Galaxy &#124; Chivas USA |publisher=Cdchivasusa.com |date=April 2, 2010 |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}</ref>  The chain's logo appeared on the front of Chivas USA jerseys and training jerseys for the rest of that year. On February 16, 2011 [[Corona (beer)|Corona]] became the presenting sponsor for Chivas USA.<ref name="Chivas USA Communications">{{cite web|author=Chivas USA Communications |url=http://www.cdchivasusa.com/news/2011/02/crossing-cultures |title=Crossing cultures &#124; Chivas USA |publisher=Cdchivasusa.com |date=February 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}</ref> The "Goats" also have [[Home Depot]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Budweiser]], [[NAPA Auto Parts]] and [[Visa, Inc.|VISA]] as team sponsors.

==Broadcasting==
Until 2012, [[Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket|FS West/Prime Ticket]] and [[KDOC-TV|KDOC]] televised all Chivas USA matches that were not nationally televised. In 2013, Chivas began the year with no local television partner; however, in August a deal was reached with KDOC (English) and MundoFOX22 [[KWHY-TV]] (Spanish) for the remainder of the 2013 season.<ref name="socceramerica.com">{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Paul |url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/53488/chivas-usa-finally-signs-tv-deal.html |title=Chivas USA, finally, signs TV deal 08/29/2013 |publisher=SoccerAmerica |date=August 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 20, 2014}}</ref> [[Tijuana]]-based [[XEWW-AM]] (W Radio 690 AM) provides Spanish-language radio broadcasts.

====Youth Academy====
The U16 and U18 Chivas USA Academy teams/players are developed as an extension of the first team/reserve program. The U14 academy team will enter the USSDA in the fall of 2013. Their education includes professional prep and a detailed understanding of the objectives, roles and expectations of first team soccer.

Chivas USA Development Academy is the standard for youth soccer development in Southern California and the United States. Their mission is to identify talented young soccer players and provide them with a competitive development plan ensuring maximum growth and improvement. Through their "Culture of Excellence," the Chivas USA Academy, in conjunction with U.S. Soccer, is designed to prepare young players for the Chivas USA First Team.

The Chivas USA Academy is a fully funded program for all of its players. These academy players will train a minimum of four days a week, they will get the opportunity to compete in the So Cal Division, and they will play in a 10-month season, which maximizes training and competitive matches for the year. In addition to the training on the field, the academy players will attend a session once a week at the Competitive Athletic Training Zone (CATZ). CATZ is the official strength, conditioning, and physical therapy providers for the Chivas USA First team and they will give all of their players in the Chivas USA Academy the access to proven training routines that will focus on physical development and nutrition.

The Chivas USA Academy Staff consists of current Chivas USA First Team Assistants, who are all USSF Licensed coaches who have earned regional and national honors from the U.S. Soccer Federation and the USSDA. Each of their head coaches have played professionally and internationally for U.S. Full Men's or Youth National Teams.
