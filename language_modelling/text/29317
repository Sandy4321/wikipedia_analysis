'''Bradwall''' is a small village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[unitary authority]] of [[Cheshire East]], about {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Sandbach]] in the ceremonial county of [[Cheshire]], [[England]], and about {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Manchester]]. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the population of the entire parish was 166.<ref name=2001census>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=792529&c=Bradwall&d=16&e=15&g=427828&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&enc=1&dsFamilyId=779 Official 2001 Census Figures.] Neighbourhood Statistics Website. Retrieval Date: 23 August 2007.</ref> The area is predominantly agricultural, with no manufacturing or retail outlets.

The village is not mentioned in the 11th century [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]], but from the 13th century gained notability as the manorial estate of Richard de Bradwall and his successors, including the families of Venables, Berington and Oldfield. From the early 19th century, it became the seat of the [[Latham of Bradwall|Latham family of Bradwall]] who resided at Bradwall Hall until its demolition in the early 20th century.

Bradwall hosts social events at the Village Hall, horse trial competitions ([[eventing]]) at Manor farm, and [[coarse fishing]] at Field Farm Fisheries. The [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Chapel Methodist Church]] has been the only place of worship since 1882. The manufacturer of [[Edwin Foden, Sons & Co.|Foden Trucks]] and their award-winning [[Foden's Band|Fodens Motor Works Band]], were based in Bradwall until a boundary change in 1936 placed them in the adjacent parish of Sandbach.

==History==

===Place name===
Bradwall is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], completed in 1086 for [[William I of England]], at which time the area was thought to be uncultivated [[moorland]] between [[Brereton, Cheshire|Brereton]] and [[Warmingham]], that formed part of the southern boundary of the Barony of Kinderton, the historic name of [[Middlewich]].<ref name="earwaker1890" />

The township derives its name from the [[Old English]] word ''br<U+0101>de'', meaning ''broad'', and ''w<U+00E6>lla'' meaning ''spring''.<ref name="survey1970">''Survey of English place names'', Volume 45, English Place-Name Society, Publisher: The University Press, 1970 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=jU-pT6vfI-ek4AS1hPjBCQ&id=zFdnAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22bradwall%22+brad+broad+stream&q=bradwall#search_anchor]</ref><ref>"[http://kepn.nottingham.ac.uk/map/place/Cheshire/Bradwall Bradwall]", ''Key to English Place Names'', Institute for Name-Studies, University of Nottingham.

===Population===
The population of Bradwall peaked in the 1920s at over 1300. The sharp decline in population in the 1930s is due to the 1936 change in the parish boundaries, when the populated area of [[Elworth]] was moved from Bradwall Parish and into Sandbach Parish.<ref>Ministry of Health, Order No. 84735, "The County of Chester Review Order", 1936.
