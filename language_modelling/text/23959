'''Laurentia Tan Yen Yi''' ({{IPA-en|l<U+0252><U+02C8>r<U+025B>n<U+0283><U+0259>}} {{respell|lo|REN|sh<U+0259>}}; {{zh|c=<U+9648><U+96C1><U+4EEA>|p=Ch<U+00E9>n Y<U+00E0>ny<U+00ED>}}, pronounced {{IPA-cmn|t<U+0282><U+0259><U+030C>n j<U+025B><U+0302>n <U+00ED>|}}) (born 24 April 1979) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based [[Singapore]]an [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Tan developed [[cerebral palsy]] and profound [[hearing impairment|deafness]] after birth, and moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of three. She took up horse riding at age of five years as a form of [[physiotherapy]]. She subsequently completed her [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at the [[Mary Hare Grammar School]], a [[boarding school|residential]] [[special school]] for the deaf, and graduated with an honours degree from [[Oxford Brookes University]] in [[hospitality management]] and tourism.

In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at [[Hartpury College]] in [[Hartpury]], [[Gloucester]], in England in July that year. At this event, her first international competition, she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre at [[Sha Tin]], she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class IA). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games. Tan was conferred the ''[[Pingat Bakti Masyarakat]]'' (Public Service Medal) by the [[President of Singapore]] at a ceremony at the [[Istana Singapore]] on 20 September 2008.

==Sporting career==
Tan took up riding in October 2005 at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders, where she met her coach Heather "Penny" Pegrum. Encouraged to participate in dressage competitions in March 2006, she quickly progressed to the Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA) Nationals that year. In March 2007, RDA Singapore contacted Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships 2007, which was a qualifier for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].<ref name="BT 20080913">{{citation|author=Siow Li Sen|title=Grooming disabled riders|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/whatsin/story/0,4574,296779,00.html?|newspaper=[[Business Times (Singapore)|Business Times]] (Singapore)|date=13 September 2008}}.</ref> The event, Tan's first international competition, was held at [[Hartpury College]], [[Gloucester]], in England in July 2007.

===2008 Summer Paralympics===
Tan's first Paralympic event was the para-[[dressage]] Individual Championship Test (grade IA). Riders in this event are categorized into grades I to IV, those in grade I having the most severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] [[gelding]] loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as "Harvey") at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre in [[Sha Tin]], Tan scored 68.80% to claim the [[bronze medal]] behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she performed to music with Nothing To Lose.<ref name="ST 20080912">{{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=Bronze once again: Tan can't hear music but she and horse 'dance' their way to 2nd medal|newspaper=The Straits Times (Sport)|date=12 September 2008|page=B21}}.</ref> The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as "beyond our expectations", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.<ref>{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Paralympics: Singapore's Laurentia Tan wins second Equestrian bronze|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/375273/1/.html|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref><ref>See also {{citation|title=Patience is a virtue|url=http://www.fei.org/Media/News_Centre/News/Pages/PG_gradeIa_9sept.aspx|publisher=[[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration <U+00C9>questre Internationale (International Federation for Equestrian Sports)]]|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=11 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}; {{citation|title=First Paralympian for Singapore emerges today <U+2013> Laurentia Tan|url=http://www.sdsc.org.sg/news_and_media/media_detail/595/|publisher=Singapore Disability Sports Council|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=13 September 2008}}; {{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Tan the history-maker: She keeps her cool to win Singapore's first Paralympic medal|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275052.asp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bF4xruFb|archivedate=1 October 2008|newspaper=Today|date=10 September 2008|page=32}}; {{citation|author=Low Lin Fhoong|title=Tan aims for No 2: One bronze in the bag, equestrian ace could taste more glory today|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275268.asp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bF4lqmNw|archivedate=1 October 2008|newspaper=Today|date=11 September 2008|page=49}}; {{citation|title=Roundup: British, German riders become biggest winners in Para-equestrian Freestyle|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/12/content_9935260.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref>

Tan's win sparked discussion about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore. A correspondent to the ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'' criticized the fact that the newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had "focused almost primarily on her disability".<ref>{{citation|author=Liang Kaicheng|title=So proud, but why focus on disability?|newspaper=The Straits Times (Forum)|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref> Another letter writer to ''[[my paper]]'' expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the [[Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Singapore women's table tennis team]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{citation|author=Yong Ming Han|title=Why so little attention paid to Paralympic bronze?|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Mailbox/Story/A1Story20080912-87350.html|newspaper=[[my paper]] (reproduced at AsiaOne)|date=12 September 2008|page=A28}}.

On 16 September, [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] [[Eunice Olsen]] asked in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] if there was a difference in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians. [[Teo Ser Luck]], Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a ''[[per capita]]'' basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the current financial year compared to S$54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794&nbsp;registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16&nbsp;disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently.<ref>{{citation|author=Jeremy Au Yong|title=Top disabled athletes get far more funding|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=17 September 2008|page=B9}}.</ref><ref name="Today 20080917">{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Paralympic hopefuls in line for more support|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/276353.asp|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5bF5RWJcu|archivedate=1 October 2008|newspaper=Today|date=17 September 2008|page=43}}.
