The '''Australian raven''' (''Corvus coronoides'') is a [[passerine]] bird in the genus ''[[Corvus (genus)|Corvus]]'' native to much of southern and northeastern Australia. Measuring {{convert|46|-|53|cm}} in length, it has all-black plumage, beak and mouth, as well as strong grey-black legs and feet. The upperparts are glossy, with a purple, blue or green sheen, and its black feathers have grey bases. The Australian raven is further distinguished from other crows and raven species by its throat hackles, which are prominent in adult birds. Adult individuals have white [[iris (anatomy)|iris]]es, while younger birds have dark brown irises until fifteen months of age, and hazel irises with an inner blue rim around each [[pupil]] until age two years and ten months. [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] described the Australian raven in 1827, its species name highlighting its similarity with the [[carrion crow]] (''C. corone''). Two [[subspecies]] are recognised, which differ slightly in calls and are quite divergent genetically.

The preferred habitat is open woodland and transitional zones. It has adapted well to urban environments and is a common city bird in [[Sydney]], [[Canberra]] and [[Perth]]. An [[omnivore|omnivorous]] and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material, as well as food waste from urban areas. In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep, and it has been blamed for killing lambs. However, this is very rare, and the raven most often scavenges for afterbirth and stillborn animals as well as lamb faeces. The Australian raven is territorial, with pairs generally bonding for life. Breeding takes place between July and September, with almost no variation across its range. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree, or occasionally in a man-made structure such as a windmill or building.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The Australian raven was first described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, when they reported [[George Caley]]'s early notes on the species from the Sydney district.<ref name=vigors1827>{{cite journal | author = Vigors, Nicholas Aylward; Horsfield, Thomas | year = 1827 | title = A Description of the Australian Birds in the Collection of the Linnean Society; with an Attempt at Arranging them According to their Natural Affinities | journal = Transactions of the Linnean Society of London | volume = 15 | pages = 170<U+2013>331 [261] | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}</ref> Its specific epithet ''coronoides'' "crow-shaped" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''corone''/<U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B7> "crow" and ''eidos''/<U+03B5><U+03AF><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C2> "shape" or "form".<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]]; [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Scott, Robert]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = Oxford, United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the [[carrion crow]] (''C. corone'') of Europe,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} though they noted it was larger with a longer bill.

[[Gregory Mathews]] described the western subspecies ''perplexus'' in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting that it was smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called ''C. coronoides coronoides'' the eastern crow, listing its range as New South Wales, and described what is now the [[Australian crow]] as another subspecies, ''C. coronoides cecilae'', calling it the north-western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia. In the same work he listed the raven as ''Corvus marianae'', with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the [[little raven]] and [[forest raven]] as subspecies.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Mathews, Gregory M. |year= 1912 |title= A Reference-List to the Birds of Australia |journal= Novitates Zoologicae |volume= 18|pages= 171<U+2013>455 [442] |url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/3110200}}</ref> Mathews had erected ''C. marianae'' in 1911 as the name after declaring ''Corvus australis'' Gould to be preoccupied;<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mathews|first=Gregory M.|date=1911|title=Alterations in the Nomenclature of "Handbook of the Birds of Australia"|journal=Emu|volume=10|pages=317<U+2013>26|doi=10.1071/MU910317}}</ref> French-American ornithologist [[Charles Vaurie]] acted as [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature#Principle of the First Reviser|First Revisor]] under Article 24 of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) Code and discarded ''C. australis'' as a junior homonym<U+2014>in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the [[black nunbird]]<U+2014>to preserve the stability of the name.<ref name="Vaurie62">{{cite book|last=Vaurie|first=Charles|title=Check-list of Birds of the World|editor=Mayr, Ernst|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=1962|edition=XV|pages=261|url=http://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14485649}}</ref> This has been followed by later authors.<ref>{{cite book |title=Directory of Australian Birds: Passerines |first1=Richard |last1=Schodde |first2=I.

German ornithologist [[Erwin Stresemann]] lumped all Australian corvids plus other species as far as India into a single species, ''C. coronoides'', as he believed there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official [[Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union|RAOU]] checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described ''C. difficilis'' in 1943 from a single specimen, now thought to have been an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.<ref name="rowley 1970"/><!-- cites para -->

Alternative names sometimes seen include southern raven, southern crow and Kelly,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} the last thought to have alluded to [[Ned Kelly|the Kelly Gang]], though did not appear until the 1920s.

===Evolution and systematics===
The Australian raven's closest relatives are the other four species of Australian corvid: the Torresian and [[Little Crow (bird)|little crow]]s as well as the forest and little ravens.<ref name="AM"/> Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed.<ref name=haring2012>{{Cite journal | last1 = Haring | first1 = Elisabeth | last2 = D<U+00E4>ubl |first2=Barbara  | last3 = Pinsker| first3 = Wilhelm  | last4 = Kryukov | first4 = Alexey |last5=Gamauf | first5 = Anita | title = Genetic divergences and intraspeci<U+FB01>c variation in corvids of the genus ''Corvus'' (Aves: Passeriformes: Corvidae) <U+2013> a <U+FB01>rst survey based on museum specimens | journal = Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0469.2012.00664.x | url = http://www.biosoil.ru/files/00010833.pdf | pages=230<U+2013>46 | volume = 50 | issue = 3}}</ref> Subsequent multigene analysis using [[nuclear DNA]] by J<U+00F8>nsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other.

Ian Rowley proposed that the common ancestor of the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north,<ref name=rowley1973f/> which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early [[Pliocene]] epoch around 4 million years ago.<ref name="jonsson 2012"/> The raven diverged into the ancestor of the forest and little ravens in the east and Australian raven in the west,<ref name=rowley1973f/> this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early [[Pleistocene]].<ref name="jonsson 2012"/> As the climate became cooler and dryer, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens.<ref name=rowley1973f>{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730157 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* ''C. c. coronoides'', the nominate or eastern subspecies, is found across most of eastern Australia.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} Its range is also highly correlated with the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which are an important source of food. Ornithologist [[Ian Rowley]] held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.<ref name="rowley 1970"/>
[[File:Australianraven.jpg|thumb|right|Subspecies ''perplexus'', Perth, WA, showing smaller hackles]]
* ''C. c. perplexus'', the western subspecies, occurs from the head of the [[Great Australian Bight]] in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its northern limits are [[Shark Bay]] and the [[mulga-eucalypt line|mulga-eucalypt boundary line]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution with the little raven, and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep.<ref name="rowley 1970"/> The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}} with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise no difference in plumage.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=714}}<!-- cites 2 previous sentences --> Intermediate birds are found in the [[Eyre Peninsula]], [[Gawler Ranges]] and vicinity of [[Lake Eyre]] in South Australia.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}}

==Description==
[[File:Corvus coronoides - Glebe Point, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia -head-8.jpg|left|thumb|Adult in [[Sydney]]. Shows bare skin on neck]]
Measuring 46<U+2013>53&nbsp;cm (18<U+2013>21&nbsp;in) in length with a 100&nbsp;cm (40&nbsp;in) wingspan and weighing around 650&nbsp;g (1.4&nbsp;lb),{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} the adult Australian raven is an all black-bird with a black beak, mouth and tongue and sturdy black or grey-black legs and feet.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=712}} The [[Tibiotarsus|tibia]] is fully feathered and the [[Tarsometatarsus|tarsus]] is long, and the feet large and strong.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=713}} It has white [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=712}}<!-- cites previous two sentences --> The plumage is glossy with a blue-purple to blue-green sheen, greenish over the ear coverts, depending on light. The underparts are not glossy.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=691}} The Australian raven has throat feathers (hackles) that are [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]] with rounded tips, while the other four species of Australian corvids have bifurcate tips, though this can be difficult to see in the field.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}} The hackles are also longer than those of the other four species; when they are raised (such as when the bird is calling), they give the bird an unusual bearded appearance. The upper third of the upper mandible, including the nares and nasal groove, is covered with bristles,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=691}} which can be up to 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) long.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=711}} The heavy-set beak is tipped with a slight hook,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=691}} and is longer than the bird's head. The wings are long and broad, with the longest of its ten [[Flight feather#Primaries|primary feathers]] (usually the seventh but occasionally the eighth) almost reaching the end of the tail when the bird is at rest. The tail is rounded or wedge-shaped.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=713}}<!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> The Australian raven can be distinguished from the two species of crow occurring in Australia by the grey base of the feathers, which is white in the latter species. The demarcation between pale and black regions on the feather is gradual in the ravens and sharply delineated in the crows. Feather bases are not normally visible when observing birds in the field, but can sometimes be seen on a windy day if the feathers are ruffled.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}}<!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> Unlike the other four species, the Australian raven has a bare patch of skin under, and extending to beside, the bill. This can be hard to discern in the field. The three species of raven are more heavily set with a broader chest than the two crow species, with the forest raven the stockiest of all.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=693}}<!-- cites previous two sentences --> Relative size of species is only useful when two species can be seen side by side, as the overlap in size is large and the difference in size small.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=694}}

===Vocalisations===
The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ''ah-ah-aaaah'' with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area.<ref name="AM">{{cite web|url=http://www.amonline.net.au/factSheets/crows_ravens.htm|author=Australian Museum Online|title=Crows and Ravens| accessdate = 12 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070901222040/http://www.amonline.net.au/factSheets/crows_ravens.htm| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=694}}<!-- cites previous two sentences --> This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory.<ref name=rowley1973b/> The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=690}} although the drawing-out of the final note<U+2014>long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven<U+2014>has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=694}}

The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There are a variety of [[contact call]]s: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched ''caa'' while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer ''caa'' with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.<ref name=rowley1973b/><!-- cites para -->

==Distribution and habitat==
The Australian raven is common throughout eastern Australia,<ref name="Birdsinbackyards"/> and southern [[Western Australia]] (the populations being connected by a narrow strip across the [[Nullarbor Plain]]), but it is rarer and more scattered in the north, with isolated sightings in Cape York at [[Coen, Queensland|Coen]], Windmill Creek and the [[Mitchell River (Queensland)|Mitchell River]],{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=696}} and becoming more common south of [[Rockhampton]] in central Queensland. It is found throughout New South Wales, though is uncommon in the northeast of the state. It is rare in the [[Australian Alps]], being replaced there by the little raven. It occurs across Victoria and eastern South Australia, through the [[Eyre Peninsula]] and [[Nullarbor Plain]] into Western Australia, across the state north to the [[Wooramel River]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=697}} It is found on some offshore islands such as [[Rottnest Island]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottnestisland.com/about/flora-and-fauna/birds|title=Birds of Rottnest Island|publisher=Rottnest Island Authority|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> and [[Kangaroo Island]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=697}} It is a rare vagrant to [[Lord Howe Island]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=697}}

The Australian raven can be found in a wide range of natural and modified habitats. It requires available water and trees (or buildings) to roost in or perch on. Preferred habitats include [[eucalypt]]-dominated [[sclerophyll]] forest, and farmland adjacent to trees. It is also found in heath and mangroves. In areas where it occurs with the little raven, namely over much of central New South Wales, Victoria and into South Australia,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}} the Australian raven is restricted to more forested areas while the latter species prefers more open areas.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=695}}<!-- cites previous four sentences --> Similarly, in inland Australia it can share range with the little crow, as the two do not appear to compete. However, the ranges of similar-sized forest raven and Torresian crow only narrowly overlap with the Australian raven as all three compete with each other. In central and western regions, Australian ravens and Torresian crows vye for the scattered uncommon trees and outcrops, and only one or the other are found there.<ref name="rowley 1970"/><!-- cites previous three sentences --> It co-occurs with the forest raven in northeastern New South Wales from [[Port Stephens]] northwards.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}} The Australian raven has adapted very well to human habitation in some cities and is the most common [[Corvidae|corvid]] in [[Canberra]], [[Sydney]] and [[Perth]]; in [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] it is replaced by the little raven,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=692}} and by the Torresian crow in [[Brisbane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Corvus-orru|title=Torresian Crow|last=Birdlife Australia|date=2014|work=Birds in Backyards|publisher=Birdlife Australia|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> Its large range, abundance and increasing population mean it is classified as ''Least Concern'' on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name="IUCN"/>

==Behaviour==
[[File:Corvus coronoides -Victoria, Australia-8 (2).jpg|thumb|left|In flight, showing rounded tail, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]]]
Difficulties in distinguishing Australian corvids has hampered understanding of seasonal movements. The Australian raven is thought to be largely sedentary, with most movement of over 16&nbsp;km (10&nbsp;mi) due to flocks of non-breeding subadult birds.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=698}} Juvenile birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are four or five months old. Smaller flocks of 8<U+2013>30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres, while larger flocks of up to 300&nbsp;birds may travel hundreds of kilometres seeking food.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=699}}

A single breeding pair and their brood can occupy a territory of up to around 120&nbsp;hectares (265&nbsp;acres) and remains there year-round, though groups of ravens may enter this area to forage.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=698}} Australian ravens will defend their territory by chasing, dive-bombing and occasionally striking the backs of birds of prey, foxes or even people.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=708}} They generally mate for life, though occasionally one male has been found to be mated with two females in adjacent territories.<ref name=rowley1973b/> If the female dies, the male Australian raven maintains the territory and finds another mate, while if the male bird is lost, the female abandons the territory.<ref name="rowley 1971">{{cite journal|last=Rowley|first=Ian|date=1971|title=Movements and longevity of ravens in south-eastern Australia|journal=CSIRO Wildlife Research|volume=16|issue=1|pages=49<U+2013>72|doi=10.1071/CWR9710049}}</ref> No courtship behaviour has been observed, and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays.<ref name=rowley1973b/> Once they begin breeding at three years of age, they live another four to five years on average. During this time they produce two surviving young each year on average.<ref name="rowley 1971"/><!-- cites previous six sentences --> The longest-lived Australian raven recorded is an adult (of at least 3 years of age) that was banded and recaptured alive 12 years and 5 months later.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=699}}

Australian ravens generally walk when moving around on the ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting in the middle of the day. They also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding.<ref name=rowley1973b/> Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=707}}

===Feeding===
The Australian raven is omnivorous, though eats more meat than smaller corvids. Its diet in summer contains a high proportion of insects, while more plant items are eaten in autumn. Flesh makes up over half its diet in winter. Invertebrates commonly eaten include [[spider]]s, [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s (which ravens behead before eating), [[grasshopper]]s, [[cicada]]s and [[caterpillar]]s (especially of the family [[Noctuidae]]), which are important in feeding nestlings. Australian ravens sometimes eat [[Common yabby|yabbies]] (''Cherax destructor'') from the edges of dams. Unusually for a ground-feeding omnivore, [[earthworm]]s are rarely eaten. Australian ravens have been reported killing birds of such size as young [[galah]]s (''Eolophus roseicapillus'') and [[common starling|starlings]] (''Sturnus vulgaris''). Most mammals are eaten as carrion, as many species are too large for the raven to kill, though young rabbits are a frequent prey item.<ref name=rowley1973e>{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730131 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids. V. Food | author= Rowley, Ian; Vestjens, W.J.M. | journal =CSIRO Wildlife Research |volume= 18|issue=1 |pages= 131<U+2013>55 |year=1973}}</ref> Australian ravens drink water frequently, up to ten times a day in hot weather. Birds have been observed dunking pieces of meat in water before eating them,<ref name=rowley1973b/> as well as doing the same with hard biscuits to make them soggy and soft.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=701}}

Australian ravens are intelligent birds, and like many other corvids have innovative methods of seeking out food.<ref name="jonsson 2012"/> Foraging takes place in the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking.<ref name=rowley1973b>{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730025 | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids.

They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs.<ref name=rowley1973e/><!-- cites previous 2 sentences --> Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue.<ref name=rowley1973b/><!-- cites previous 4 sentences --> Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=696}} In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1071/MU9880122 |last= Richardson|first= KC |year= 1988|title= Are Australian corvids nectarivorous?. |journal= Emu |volume=88 |issue= 2|pages=122<U+2013>23 |id= |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=1855171&q=Corvus+coronoides&uid=1196122&setcookie=yes (abstract) |accessdate= 14 Aug 2007}}</ref> Australian ravens sometimes forage in [[mixed-species foraging flock|mixed-species flocks]] with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=700}}

===Breeding===
Australian ravens begin breeding once they are three years old.<ref name="rowley 1971"/> Breeding season is from July to September,<ref name = "Ber03"/> with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species with a wide range and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October.<ref name=rowley1973c>{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/CWR9730067  | title=The Comparative Ecology of Australian Corvids. III.

IV. Nesting and the rearing of young to independence | author= Rowley, Ian |   journal =CSIRO Wildlife Research |volume= 18|issue=1 |pages= 91<U+2013>129 |year=1973}}</ref> The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles,{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=696}} or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the [[AWA Tower]] in Sydney.<ref name=rowley1973d/>

Nests are generally large and untidy, consisting of a bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses, barks, and feathers that can be up to 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) thick.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=710}} As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are 30<U+2013>60&nbsp;cm (12<U+2013>24&nbsp;in) long and 0.6<U+2013>1.2&nbsp;cm ({{frac|1|4}}<U+2013>{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;in) thick, into the tree fork to make a platform. Thinner sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers. Both birds build the nest, with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material. New nests are built each year generally, as the re-use of old ones might spread disease or parasites<U+2014>nests become caked with faeces as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal. Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations.<ref name=rowley1973d/> The female develops a [[brood patch]]<U+2014>a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid. The skin itself is oedematous and wrinkled, and does not get re-feathered until December after the breeding season has finished.<ref name=rowley1973c/><!-- cites previous 2 sentences -->

Their lofty locations makes monitoring of Australian raven nests difficult.<ref name=rowley1973d/> A clutch can comprise up to six eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the commonest number.<ref name=rowley1973d/> Measuring 45 by 30&nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|3|4}} <U+00D7> {{frac|1|1|4}}&nbsp;in), eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings.<ref name = "Ber03">{{cite book  | author= Beruldsen, Gordon | title = Australian Birds: Their Nests and Eggs  | publisher = self  | year = 2003  | location = Kenmore Hills, Queensland  | page = 384 | doi = | isbn = 0-646-42798-9  | authorlink = Gordon Beruldsen}}</ref> Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified.<ref name=rowley1973d/> [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20&nbsp;days.

===Parasites and predators===
A [[circovirus]]<U+2014>given the name raven circovirus or RaCV<U+2014>was isolated from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006. It has affinities with canary circovirus (CaCV) and pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Its clinical significance is unknown.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stewart, Meredith E.; Perry, Ross; Raidal, Shane R. |date=2006|title=Identification of a novel circovirus in Australian ravens (''Corvus coronoides'') with feather disease|journal=Avian Pathology|volume=35|issue=2|pages=86<U+2013>92|doi=10.1080/03079450600597345}}</ref> Tick infestation is rare in the Australian raven, with ''[[Ixodes holocyclus]]'' and ''[[Amblyomma triguttatum]]'' recorded.

The [[wedge-tailed eagle]] (''Aquila audax'') preys on adult, nestling, and fledgling Australian ravens, while the [[little eagle]] (''Hieraaetus morphnoides'') also takes nestlings, and [[powerful owl]] (''Ninox strenua'') has been recorded killing adults;{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=711}} other birds of prey are seen as threats, yet there is no evidence they have successfully preyed on the ravens. The introduced [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'') competes with the Australian raven for carrion and can drive it off. It may also kill young birds that it catches on the ground.<ref name=rowley1973d/> The [[channel-billed cuckoo]] (''Scythrops novaehollandiae'') has been recorded as a [[brood parasite]].{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=711}}

==Relationship with humans==
Australian ravens die most often by being shot or poisoned<U+2014>generally by farmers. Despite their fondness for roadkill, fewer ravens are hit by vehicles than [[Australian magpie]]s. Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64% of Australian ravens perished in their first year of life. Immature birds are most at risk of dying as they are more likely to come into conflict with farmers.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=699}} The Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs.<ref name="Predatory Birds">{{cite web |url=http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/dpi/nreninf.nsf/childdocs/-C3270146B772814F4A2568B30006FFEE-7A5820241AEA1564CA256BC800078098-7B785784C934E20E4A256DEA00292002-75C7A9C8E202D918CA256BCF000B4D7C?open|author=Temby, Ian|title=Predatory Birds|accessdate=12 August 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070917120936/http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/DPI/nreninf.nsf/childdocs/-C3270146B772814F4A2568B30006FFEE-7A5820241AEA1564CA256BC800078098-7B785784C934E20E4A256DEA00292002-75C7A9C8E202D918CA256BCF000B4D7C?open| archivedate= 17 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Scientific observation in the country's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked.<ref name=rowley69>{{cite journal |last=Rowley |first=Ian |year=1969|title=An evaluation of predation by 'crows' on young lambs |journal=CSIRO Wildlife Research |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=153<U+2013>79 |doi=10.1071/CWR9690153}}</ref> Australian ravens mostly eat faeces (often from the lamb's anus), afterbirth or stillborn lambs.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=701}}{{efn|1=Lambing takes place in late winter, with stillbirth rates around 20%, so there is a supply of carrion around farming areas.{{sfn|Higgins|2006|p=701}} }} Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious, containing around 21-44% protein, 9-37% fat and 10-30% carbohydrate.
