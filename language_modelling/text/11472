==Life==
[[Image:Montevideo D<U+00E9>cembre 2007 - Plaza de Armas 1.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Artigas in [[Plaza Independencia|La Plaza Independencia]], Montevideo]]
Artigas was born in [[Montevideo]], the son of Martin Jos<U+00E9> Artigas and Francisca  Antonio Arnal. His grandparents came from [[Zaragosa]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Tenerife]] ([[Canary Islands]]).<ref>http://losabuelosdemihistoria.blogspot.com/2010/06/jose-gervasio-artigas.html. Los abuelos de Jos<U+00E9> Artigas (The grandparents of Jos<U+00E9> Artigas). Accessed October 5, 2010 at 11:35.</ref>  He came from a wealthy family, and at age 12 he moved to the countryside and worked on his family's farms. He excelled at marksmanship and riding, and tried his hand at smuggling from Portuguese-controlled Brazil.

At age 33, he took advantage of an [[amnesty]] for those who had committed non-violent crimes, and entered the Corps of Blandengues to protect the border with Brazil. From 1806 to 1807, he participated in the Spanish resistance to the [[British invasions of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]. He was part of the force which, under [[Santiago de Liniers]], [[Montevideo]] contributed to the liberation ("Reconquista") of [[Buenos Aires]] from [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford]]'s occupation in 1806, and also to the [[Battle of Montevideo (1807)|Battle of Montevideo]]. Following the Spanish defeat at Montevideo, he was captured. He was spared being shipped to Britain as a [[prisoner of war]], having been wounded in the battle.

In 1810, Spain moved the headquarters for the [[Viceroyalty of the R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]] to Montevideo after the [[May Revolution]] forced them to abandon Buenos Aires. On 15 February 1811, Artigas left the Corps of Blandengues and went to Buenos Aires to offer his military services in the fight for independence in the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Bank]] (present-day Uruguay). In early April, he returned to the Eastern Bank with approximately 180 men provided by the Government of Buenos Aires; on April 11, he issued the Mercedes Proclamation and assumed control of the revolution, subsequently defeating the Spanish in the [[Battle of Las Piedras]]. He set siege to Montevideo and was proclaimed First Chief of the "Orientals" (the name of Uruguay being originally Banda Oriental del Uruguay (Eastern Bank of Uruguay) and later Provincia Oriental del Uruguay (Oriental Province of Uruguay); Uruguayans thus refer to themselves as ''Orientales'').

In 1814, he organized the [[Liga Federal|Liga de los Pueblos Libres]] (''League of the Free Peoples''), of which he was declared Protector. In the following year, he liberated Montevideo from the control of the "Unitarians" from Buenos Aires. 

In 1815, he attended the Proto-congress of the Independence of Argentina, held in Arrollo de la China (today known as Concepci<U+00F3>n del Uruguay).  It was at this congress that the provinces of the Oriental Province (today the country of Uruguay), [[C<U+00F3>rdoba Province, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]], [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province|Entre R<U+00ED>os]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] declared themselves independent from Spain and formed the [[Liga Federal]] ("Federal League").  The Liga Federal invited other provinces of the former Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata to join them under a federal system.

In this congress, Artigas ratified the use of the flag created by [[Manuel Belgrano]] (which would later become the flag of the [[Argentine Republic]]), but added a diagonal festoon in red, the color of federalism in [[Argentina]] at that time.

The continued growth of influence and prestige of the Federal League frightened the governments in [[Buenos Aires]] (because of its federalism) and Portugal (because of its republicanism), and in August 1816, Portugal invaded the [[Uruguay|Eastern Province]] (with tacit complicity from Buenos Aires), with the intention of destroying Artigas and his revolution.

The Portuguese forces, led by [[Carlos Frederico Lecor]], captured Artigas and his deputies and occupied Montevideo on 20 January 1817, but the struggle continued for three years in the countryside. Infuriated by Buenos Aires's passivity, Artigas [[Argentine Civil War|declared war on Buenos Aires]] while he was losing to the Portuguese. His subordinates, members of the Federal League -- [[Francisco Ram<U+00ED>rez (caudillo)|Francisco Ram<U+00ED>rez]], governor of [[Entre R<U+00ED>os Province|Entre R<U+00ED>os]], and [[Estanislao L<U+00F3>pez]], governor of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] -- managed to [[Battle of Cepeda (1820)|defeat the centralism of Buenos Aires]]. But hope for a new nation was short-lived; both commanders entered [[Treaty of Pilar|agreements with Buenos Aires]] that went against the principles of Artigas.  They rebelled against him and left him to be crushed by the Portuguese.

Without resources and men, Artigas withdrew to [[Paraguay]] in September 1820. In Paraguay, Dr. [[Jos<U+00E9> Gaspar Rodr<U+00ED>guez de Francia|Francia]], the dictator, banished him to Candelaria.  He then disappeared from the political life of the region. (B. Nahum).

After a long exile, he died in Paraguay in 1850, at age 86. It is said that Artigas, feeling near death, asked for a horse and died in the saddle, as a gaucho. His remains were buried and then re<U+00EF>ntered at the Pante<U+00F3>n Nacional in 1855. On the 19th of June, 1977, his remains were transferred to the [[Artigas Mausoleum]] in the centre of the [[Plaza Independencia]].

==Quotations==
[[image:Gervasioartigas.JPG|right|thumb|230px|[[Statue]] of Artigas in [[Belo Horizonte]].]]
* I will not sell the rich heritage of the fatherland at the low price of necessity.
''No vender<U+00E9> el rico patrimonio de la Patria al bajo precio de la necesidad''.
* My authority comes from you, and it ceases before your sovereign presence.
''Mi autoridad emana de vosotros, y ella cesa ante vuestra presencia soberana''.
* Mercy for the defeated.
''Clemencia para los vencidos''.
* Let the Orientals be as enlightened as they are brave.
''Sean los orientales tan ilustrados como valientes''.

==Ideals==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
Artigas admired the United States of America and was said to always carry a copy of the [[United States Constitution]] with him. He wanted the [[Origin and history of the name of Argentina|United Provinces of the River Plate]] government to be based on the same federalist ideas as the USA. These ideals went against what the Buenos Aires government of the time wanted (a centralised state; some even supported the idea of putting a European monarch in charge of the newly independent lands), but he managed to gain the support of some other provinces. Because of this, the Buenos Aires government supported the Portuguese invasion of the Eastern Bank.

==Legacy and commemoration==
Artigas has become a national hero in Uruguay. This is significant as, since independence, many Uruguayan figures have been heroes of either the Colorado or the Blanco party, while being reviled by the other side. As such, Artigas has been the namesake of numerous places, vessels, etc. throughout [[History of Uruguay|Uruguayan history]], particularly during periods of peace and reunification between the parties.
