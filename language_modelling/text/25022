'''''WhirlGirl''''' debuted in 1997 as an online sci-fi series about a reluctant superheroine battling an evil "mediatech" empire in 2077 Southern California. The title character<U+2014>dubbed "a real revolutionary for a virtual age"<U+2014>balanced freedom-fighting with realistic personal concerns like dating and having friends. 

Initially launched as a [[web comic]] with light animation and short bursts of music and sound effects, ''WhirlGirl'' ultimately became the first regularly scheduled web series using [[Flash animation]], and went on to achieve a variety of other industry firsts over a 100-[[webisode]] career, including: syndication partnerships with major websites, a distribution partnership with a premium cable network, a [[web television]] simulcast, cross-media advertising campaigns, and licensing and merchandising agreements.<ref>Karl Cohen, [http://mag.awn.com/index.php?&article_no=1079&page=8 "Milestones Of The Animation Industry In The 20th Century"], Animation World Network, 2000-01-01</ref>

==Characters==
Kia Cross is the only daughter of mid-21st century revolutionary leader Morgan Cross. After Morgan was captured and destroyed by forces working for ZoneWerks, an evil media/technology corporation run by Ty Harden, Kia was brainwashed and dispatched to a life of quiet servitude. Flash forward: Years later, as the programming wears off, Kia recalls her mother's work and transforms herself into a superheroine. Armed with a trademark weapon (the whirlblade) and a signature fighting move (the spin kick), she resumes the fight for freedom.

WhirlGirl's allies include Stekatta "Kat" Tressner, a stylish gear-head with a thing for WhirlGirl, and teenager Sid X, who can control computers telepathically with a "cybernetic crystal" implanted in his forehead. Victoria Thalios leads the "FreeVox" rebel group, which WhirlGirl often defends. 

WhirlGirl's primary foe, Ty Harden, not only runs the evil ZoneWerks empire; he is also Sid X's estranged father. Harden relies on Axxen Baines, a sadist who heads the ZoneWerks security apparatus. 

==Guest Characters==
In a September 1999 webisode, magicians [[Penn & Teller]] appeared as animated versions of themselves in a futuristic Las Vegas.<ref>Judith Cockman, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.07/4.07pages/4.07internet.php3 "Penn & Teller Guest Star On ''WhirlGirl''], Animation World Magazine, October 1999</ref>

In May 2000, WhirlGirl teamed up with the hero of the SciFi (now [[Syfy]]) Channel's ''[[Barbarian Moron]]'' cartoon in a series of webisodes that appeared on both the [[Showtime]] and SciFi websites.<ref>Press release, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_20050229/ai_mark03006130/ "SHO.com And SCIFI.COM Announce Popular Online Flash Comics Featured In Unique Crossover Episodes"] Market Wire, May 2000</ref>

==Animation==
Created by David B. Williams and produced by Visionary Media, the studio he founded, ''WhirlGirl'' launched at a Spring 1997 trade show.<ref>CNET News.com Staff, [http://news.cnet.com/Net-TVs-nowhere-near-critical-mass/2100-1001_3-275357.html "Net TVs nowhere near critical mass"] CNET News.com, March 3, 1997</ref> Because high-speed broadband access at home was very rare in 1997, and rich media could take minutes to load with a dial-up connection, the series consisted of comic-book-style panels livened up with [[animated GIFs]] (minimal animation elements) and looping music and sound effects. In August 1998, using Macromedia's new Flash 2.0 animation software, ''WhirlGirl'' replaced its comic-strip panels with five-minute-long webisodes, becoming one of the first animated web series.<ref>Bernhard Warner, [http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/iq-news-looking-sci-fi-buffs-lycos-lands-whirlgirl-web-strip-35296 "IQ News: Looking For Sci-Fi Buffs, Lycos Lands Whirlgirl Web Strip"] Adweek, 1998-07-13</ref>

==Distribution==
Even before the series was fully animated, Visionary signed online syndication deals with five affiliates, and ''WhirlGirl'' debuted in March 1998 on BMG's BUGjuice, E-Pub's Amused, ICL's GamesZone, Microsoft's WebTV Networks, and Canada's BeyondTV.<ref> Dana Blankenhorn, [http://www.a-clue.com/archive/98/cl980330.htm "This Week's Clue: The Direction of Technology"], A-Clue.Com, 1998-03-30</ref> That July, the site began running on [[Lycos]] as well.<ref>Bernhard Warner, [http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/iq-news-looking-sci-fi-buffs-lycos-lands-whirlgirl-web-strip-35296 "IQ News: Looking For Sci-Fi Buffs, Lycos Lands Whirlgirl Web Strip"] Adweek, 1998-07-13</ref>
 
In January 1999, Showtime licensed ''WhirlGirl'' for online and on-air use, making it the first regularly scheduled animated web series <ref>Karl Cohen, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.10/4.10pages/cohenmilestones6.php3 "Milestones Of The Animation Industry In The 20th Century"], Animation World Magazine, 2000-01-01</ref> and the first independently produced web series licensed by a national television network.<ref>Broadcasting & Cable Staff, [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/96389-You_go_WhirlGirl.php "You go, WhirlGirl"], Broadcasting & Cable, 2000-09-03</ref> Showtime's parent company, [[Viacom]], took an undisclosed equity stake in Visionary Media.<ref>Richard Tedesco, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-59810090.html "Can't keep a good WhirlGirl down"], Broadcasting & Cable, 2000-02-07</ref> All 100 episodes were also dubbed into Spanish and distributed on [[Yupi.]], one of the first major Spanish-language online networks.<ref>Press release, [http://www.allbusiness.com/technology/software-services-applications-internet-social/6396567-1.html "Yupi.com and Showtime Networks Inc.

==Convergence==
On February 27, 1999, the series helped advance web-TV convergence by being the first animated webisode to premiere simultaneously on a TV channel and its website<U+2014>in this case, Showtime and SHO.com. ''WhirlGirl'' went on to appear in 100 weekly webisodes <ref>Kidscreen staff, [http://kidscreen.com/2001/06/01/30892-20010601/ "WhirlGirl spins into TV format"], Kidscreen, 2001-06-01</ref> through March 2001, with the character making occasional appearances on the TV channel as, for example the "host" of a programming block called "Lethal Ladies."<ref> Lee Dannacher, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.05/4.05pages/dannacheralley.php3 "The Big Apple's Silicon Alley"], Animation World Magazine, August 1999</ref>

==Marketing==
In July 1997, ''WhirlGirl'' became the first web series promoted with a traditional TV ad campaign that included high-profile spots in major markets.<ref>AdAge Staff, [http://adage.com/article/news/web-action-series-whirlgirl-launches-national-tv-ad-campaign/3890/ "Web action series ''WhirlGirl'' launches with national TV ad campaign"], Advertising Age, 1997-07-11</ref> In 1999, Showtime supported ''WhirlGirl'' with a million-dollar multimedia marketing campaign featuring billboards and other outdoor ads in major U.S. markets, as well as full-page ads in major magazines.<ref>David Kilmer, [http://www.awn.com/news/internet-and-interactive/showtime-puts-whirlgirl-public-eye "SHOWTIME puts WHIRLGIRL in the public eye"], Animation World Network, 1999-08-08</ref>

''WhirlGirl'' also appeared on the SciFi (now Syfy) Channel as part of the ''Barbarian Moron'' stunt, and in June 1999 became the first non-MTV property to be represented for licensing and merchandising by [[MTV Networks]] (another Viacom property).<ref> Kenneth Li, "WhirlGirl joining forces with MTV", ''Daily News (New York)'', 1999-08-02</ref>

In 2000, toy maker [[ReSaurus]] unveiled a ''WhirlGirl'' action figure at [[Toy Fair]], but the toy was not brought to market.<ref> RTM Staff, [http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/651.shtml "ReSaurus Debuts WhirlGirl Prototype"], Raving Toy Maniac, 2000-06-26</ref>
