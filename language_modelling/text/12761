"'''Simpsons Bible Stories'''" is the eighteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 10)|tenth season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the [[United States]] on [[Easter]], 1999. It is the first of ''The Simpsons'' now annual trilogy episodes, and consists of four self-contained segments.{{#tag:ref|Although the episode consists of four segments,<ref name="thestarledger" /> executive producer and former showrunner [[Mike Scully]] stated that it was the first official trilogy episode in its commentary.<ref name="Scully" />|group="nb"}} In the episode the Simpsons all fall asleep during a boring sermon in church. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] dreams that she and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] are [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Lisa dreams that she and her fellow [[Springfield Elementary School]] students are [[Hebrew]] slaves in [[Ancient Egypt]] and guides [[Moses]] to lead them to freedom. Homer dreams that he is [[King Solomon]] called to resolve a dispute between [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] over the ownership of a pie, and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] dreams he is [[King David]], who has to fight Goliath's son, Goliath II.

"Simpsons Bible Stories" was written by [[Matt Selman]], [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]] and [[Tim Long]], and was the first episode [[Nancy Kruse]] directed for ''The Simpsons''. While executive producer and former showrunner [[Mike Scully]] stated that the idea for the episode came after Fox requested an Easter-themed episode, co-writer Selman argued that it was conceived by former staff writers [[Dan Greaney]] and [[Donick Cary]] while they were pitching ideas for the tenth season. Because the episode mostly takes place outside Springfield, the animators had to design completely new sets. While the episode mostly features references to Christianity, it also parodies children's television programs, American politicians and action films by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. 

In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 12.2&nbsp;million viewers, a significant drop from the previous episode which garnered 15.5&nbsp;million viewers. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics and won an [[Annie award]] in the category of Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of ''The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season'' [[DVD]] box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator [[Matt Groening]]'s favorite moments on ''The Simpsons''.

==Plot==
It is a scorching hot [[Easter]] at church, and no one is interested in [[Reverend Timothy Lovejoy|Reverend Lovejoy]]'s sermons. When the collection plate is passed round, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny that he found in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked [[cult image|idol]], and provoking him to read the [[Bible]] from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.

===Marge's Dream===
[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] dreams that she and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] are [[Adam and Eve]]. They peacefully live in the [[Garden of Eden]] until a [[Satan|snake]] ([[Snake Jailbird]]) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the forbidden tree. He persuades Eve to try one when [[God]] ([[Ned Flanders]]) witnesses his sin. Even though Homer ate the most, God only caught Eve eating the apples, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of a way of getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's [[unicorn]], named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.

===Lisa's Dream===
[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] imagines she and all the other [[Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary]] students are [[Hebrews]] in ancient [[Egypt]], with the [[Pharaoh]] ([[Principal Skinner]]) making them build a [[pyramid]]. Only [[Moses]] ([[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]]) can liberate the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's [[sarcophagus]], supposedly incited by the [[burning bush]], he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce [[pandemic|plagues]] to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the [[Israelites]]; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the [[Red Sea|sea]], Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if it is going to be smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many years, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.

===Homer's Dream===
Homer pictures himself as [[King Solomon]]. [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] fight over ownership of a pie. King Solomon cuts it in half, sentences Lenny and Carl to death, and then eats the pie. King Solomon then presides over a civil case between [[Jesus Christ]] and Checker Chariot.

===Bart's Dream===
[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] sees himself as [[King David]], who kills [[Goliath]], but has not won the war yet: [[Nelson Muntz|Nelson]] is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed [[Methuselah]] ([[Abe Simpson|Grampa]]), David's oldest friend. In retaliation, David challenges Goliath II, but having no stones to sling at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets [[Ralph Wiggum|Ralph]], a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try and slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous [[Tower of Babel]] beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to [[jail]] as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best [[King]] they ever had, building [[roads]], [[libraries]] and [[hospitals]]. The dream ends with a title card that reads "A Bart Simpson Dream".

===Ending sequence===
As the family wakes up, they find themselves alone in the church. Upon exiting they realize that the [[Apocalypse]] has come; fire rains from a red sky, and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]] ride past. The Flanders ascend into Heaven, but The Simpsons do not; Lisa begins to ascend, but Homer grabs her ankle and pulls her back down. Instead, the Simpsons descend via a staircase into Hell, where Homer follows the delicious scent of barbecue. The episode ends with Homer screaming in agony (because there are no hot dogs, pineapple in the [[coleslaw]], and german [[potato salad]]) as [[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway To Hell]] by [[AC/DC]] plays over the credits.

==Production==
"Simpsons Bible Stories" was co-written by [[Matt Selman]], [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]] and [[Tim Long]], and was the first episode [[Nancy Kruse]] directed for ''The Simpsons''. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1999, the day [[Easter]] took place that year. According to executive producer and former [[showrunner]] [[Mike Scully]], the idea for the episode was conceived when Fox requested an easter-themed ''Simpsons'' episode that would air on the holiday. Normally, Fox would not broadcast any new ''Simpsons'' episodes on Easter, as it is considered a "low-ratings night," but "Simpsons Bible Stories" was an exception.<ref name="Scully">Scully, Mike. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>  However, according to co-writer Selman, the idea for the episode came about when he and former staff writer [[Dan Greaney]] were pitching episode ideas for the tenth season with former staff writer [[Donick Cary]]. Cary and Greaney suggested a "bible-trilogy" story, which then became "Simpsons Bible Stories".<ref name="Selman">Selman, Matt. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> "Simpsons Bible Stories" is the first of the trilogy episodes which, since the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|season 12]] episode "[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]", ''The Simpsons'' produces once every season.<ref name="Scully" />
[[Image:Matt Selman by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Matt Selman]] ''(pictured)'' wrote the episode together with [[Tim Long]] and [[Larry Doyle (writer)|Larry Doyle]].]]
The first segment was written by Long. According to former staff writer [[Tom Martin (writer)|Tom Martin]], Long wanted the pig in the garden of Eden to have a "Tony British" accent.<ref name="Martin">Martin, Tom. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The pig was voiced by regular cast member [[Hank Azaria]], who portrays [[Moe Szyslak]] among other characters in the series.<ref name="Groening">Groening, Matt. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The unicorn that digs a hole from the garden of Eden was portrayed by [[Tress MacNeille]].<ref name="Selman" /> The second segment was written by Doyle.<ref name="Doyle" /> The episode's third segment was written by Selman. When writing segments for trilogy episodes, the writing staff usually follow the stories they are based on, while putting ''The Simpsons'' characters in the original characters' place. With "Simpsons Bible Stories"' third segment, Selman stated that he wanted to go a "fresh new way" by instead writing a sequel to the story of David and Goliath. According to Scully, Selman had a very clear vision of how he wanted the segment to be,<ref name="Scully" /> and Selman said that he wanted to make a "dog's breakfast" of movie clich<U+00E9>s at the time.<ref name="Selman" /> 

The song that plays during Bart's training montage is "Winner Takes It All" by American rock singer [[Sammy Hagar]]. Selman decided to include the song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film ''[[Over the Top (film)|Over the Top]]''.<ref name="Selman" /> According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length.<ref name="Doyle">Doyle, Larry. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The song that plays during the episode's end credits is "[[Highway to Hell]]" by Australian hard rock band [[AC/DC]]. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on ''The Simpsons'' at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, it turned out he had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they asked if they could use "Highway to Hell", the band's manager "signed on right away" and gave the ''Simpsons'' staff a "huge discount."<ref name="Scully" />

Because most of the episode takes place in ancient history, the animators had to create completely new sets and designs for the episode. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Kruse stated that she and staff animator Alex Ruiz had to re-draw a majority of the episode, as the faulty scenes were drawn by six trainees. In order to receive an animator credit on ''The Simpsons'', an animator has to draw ten scenes in an episode. Because the trainees did not draw ten scenes each, none of them were credited for their work on the episode. All the trainees were later hired to ''The Simpsons'' animation staff. Kruse stated that, while animating the episode, she was worried that the animation would be offended by the episode's content, as many of the crew members were "very religious."<ref name="Kruse" /> However, as animation ensued, she found that most of the animators were not uncomfortable with the episode, as it mostly parodies the Old Testament. The only complaint she received was from an animator who refused to animate Jesus in the court room scene in Homer's dream.<ref name="Kruse">Kruse, Nancy. (2007). Commentary for "Simpsons Bible Stories", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> 

In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that he regretted not submitting "Simpsons Bible Stories" for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the category of [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)|animated programming less than one hour]] in 1999. At the time, Scully reasoned that,  because the original stories were not conceived by the writing staff, the episode would not hold up. However, he noted that the episode's animation was "outstanding," and that he later found out that the Emmy awards "put a lot of importance on" the animation in submitted episodes.<ref name="Scully" /> Instead of submitting "Simpsons Bible Stories" for the Emmy awards in 1999, Scully submitted "[[Viva Ned Flanders]]", which ultimately lost to the ''[[King of the Hill]]'' episode "[[And They Call It Bobby Love]]."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=&program=&start_year=1999&end_year=1999&network=149&web_category=All&winner=All |title=Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour Or Less) - 1999 |accessdate=June 8, 2011 |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] }}</ref>

==Cultural references==
"Simpsons Bible Stories" contains several references to the Christian prophets, holy book and the religion as a whole, as well as films based on the Bible.<ref name="Selman" /> Each segment is based on a biblical story, mostly from the Old Testament.<ref name="Kruse" /> The first segment is based on the story of [[Adam and Eve]], who, according to the [[Book of Genesis]] were the first [[First man or woman|man and woman]] created by [[YHWH]], the [[God]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Ned Flanders has the role of God, while the serpent that lures Marge into eating an apple from the forbidden tree resembles Snake Jailbird. The Garden of Eden was the place where Adam and Eve lived after they were created by God, according to the Book of Genesis.<ref name="BBC" />
[[File:Santa Cruz del Valle de los Ca<U+00ED>dos.jpg|left|230px|thumb|"Simpsons Bible Stories" features several references to [[Christianity]]. Shown here is a [[Christian cross]], the best-known [[religious symbol]] of Christianity.]]
The second segment parodies Moses who, according to the [[Book of Exodus]], freed the Israelites from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Milhouse has the role of Moses while Skinner has the role of the Pharaoh.<ref name="BBC" /> When the Pharaoh asked who vandalized his sarcophagus, the [[burning bush]] tells him that Bart did it. When Bart is seized by the Pharaoh's guards, he exclaims "No, the bush set me up!" Bart's line refers to the [[Marion Barry#1990 arrest|1990 arrest]] of [[Marion Barry]] who, while being arrested by the FBI for smoking [[crack cocaine]], exclaimed "No, the bitch set me up!"<ref name="Selman" /> In a scene in the segment, Milhouse and Lisa can be seen pouring frogs into Skinner's tent. The scene refers to the second of ten [[Biblical plagues]] that were imposed on Egypt by Yahweh, in chapters 7-12 of the Book of Exodus.<ref name="scriptures">{{harvnb|Reinhartz|2003|p=25}}</ref> While they are inside the torture chamber, Milhouse and Lisa walk past an orb. The orb is called "Orb of Isis" and played a big part in the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|season 9]] episode "[[Lost Our Lisa]]".<ref name="Scully" /> In another scene, Milhouse parts the Red Sea so that his fellow slaves can escape. The execution of the scene is based on the one seen in the 1956 American epic film ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', in which Moses parts the Red Sea.<ref name="BBC" /> The shot in which Pharaoh and his guards are drowning is also taken from the movie.<ref name="Selman" />

In Homer's dream, Homer has the role of [[King Solomon]] who, according to the [[Books of Kings]] and [[Book of Chronicles]] was a [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]], as well as one of the 48 prophets according to the [[Talmud]].<ref name="BBC" /> Bart's dream shows Bart as King David and, rather than telling the story of David and Goliath, Bart's dream is a "sequel" to the story. The segment is inspired by and contains references to several films by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], including ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', and borrows elements from other action films.<ref name="Selman" /> At one point in the segment, Bart's dog Santa's Little Helper starts talking to him. The dog's voice is similar to that of Goliath in the Christian stop-motion animated television series ''[[Davey and Goliath]]''.<ref name="Groening" /> Inside the whale skeleton in the episode, Bart finds the remains of [[Jonah]]. Jonah was a prophet of the northern kingdom of Israel, according to the Hebrew Bible. Nelson lives in the [[Tower of Babel]] which, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower that the humans built in order to reach heaven.<ref name="Selman" /> After being defeated by Bart, Nelson reappears while a variation of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s composition ''[[Night on Bald Mountain#Composition history|St. John's Night on the Bare Mountain]]'' plays in the background. At the end of the segment, Bart is arrested and Chief Wiggum says "Where's your messiah now?" Wiggum's line was also taken from ''The Ten Commandments''.<ref name="BBC" />

==Release and reception==
In its original American broadcast on April&nbsp;4,&nbsp;1999, "Simpsons Bible Stories" received a 7.4 Nielsen rating, translating to approximately 7.4&nbsp;million viewers.<ref name="stpaulpioneerpress">{{cite news |title=CBS wins week, thanks to Della Reese |date=April 7, 1999 |page=9A |work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]] |publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]] |author=David Bauder |coauthor=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but [[Nielsen Media Research]] estimated that 12.2&nbsp;million viewers watched the episode, a considerable drop from the [[Maximum Homerdrive|previous episode]], which was seen by an estimated 15.5&nbsp;million viewers. David Bianculli of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' attributed the loss in viewership to the fact that the episode aired on a religious holiday.<ref name="newyorkdailynews">{{cite news |title='Futurama's' untimely change Fox schedule shift a disservice to this popular show & its fans |date=April 6, 1999 |page=94 |work=[[New York Daily News]] |publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]] |author=David Bianculli |coauthor=|accessdate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, it was the week's second most watched program on the network.<ref name="stpaulpioneerpress" /> Later that year, the episode received an [[Annie award]] in the category of [[Annie Award for Best Animated Television Production|Best Animated Television Production]], the second year in a row that ''The Simpsons'' won the award.<ref name="thedallasmorningnews">{{cite news |title='Iron Giant' towers at animation awards |date=November 8, 1999 |page=23A |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |publisher=James M.

Following its broadcast, "Simpsons Bible Stories" received mixed reviews from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' wrote that the episode is "A fantastic twist of the Treehouse of Horror style of storytelling," and added that each segment is a "classic on its own."<ref name="BBC" /> They wrote that Wiggum telling Moses and Lisa to give his regards to the British Museum as he seals them inside a tomb and Marge asking Bart if he is wearing clean underwear as they face the apocalypse were some of the episode's "best moments," and concluded by writing that the episode is "''The Simpsons'' at its very best: inventive, irreverent and very, very funny."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page17.shtml|title=Simpsons Bible Stories|accessdate=June 8, 2011|author=Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> While DVD Town's James Plath wrote that the episode's premise was "risky," he still enjoyed the episode.<ref name="dvdtown">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtown.com/review/simpsons-the-the-complete-10th-season/dvd/5056 |title=Simpsons, The: The Complete 10th Season (DVD) |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2011|last=Plath |first=James |publisher=DVD Town}}</ref> [[Alan Sepinwall]] and Matt Zoller Seitz of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' described the episode as "hilarious," however they noted that the episode's "suggestion that Moses parted the Red Sea by having all the Israelites flush their toilets at once" could result in a backlash from the "religious right."<ref name="thestarledger">{{cite news |title=ALL TV - Relatively bland 'Raymond' ripoff a sitcom hardly anybody could love |date=April 6, 1999 |page=39 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]] |publisher=Richard Vezza |author=Alan Sepinwall |coauthor=Matt Zoller Seitz |accessdate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref>

On the other hand, giving the episode a negative review, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that "Simpsons Bible Stories" "proves less successful [than most [[Treehouse of Horror (series)|Treehouse of Horror]] episodes]."<ref name="DVDmg" /> He added that he "just think the brevity required by the inclusion of three separate tales better suits the world of horror spoofs than it does these Bible pieces," as they "try to pack an awful lot into very little time."<ref name="DVDmg" /> He concluded by writing that, while the episode has "some good moments," he didn't find a lot of entertainment in it.<ref name="DVDmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonten.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Tenth Season (1998) |date=August 20, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2011|last=Jacobson |first=Colin |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}</ref> Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also critical, and wrote that the episode "fails to be funny" because it "strays too far from the source material."<ref name="dignews" /> He added "have you read the bible?

At the end of the episode, the Simpsons walk out of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts ascending into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says "Where do you think you're going, missy?"<ref name="episode">{{cite episode |title=Simpsons Bible Stories |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Doyle, Larry; Selman, Matt; Kruse, Nancy |network=Fox |airdate=April 4, 1999 |season=10|number=18}}</ref> The gag was written by staff writer [[George Meyer]], and is series creator [[Matt Groening]]'s favorite joke of the series.<ref name="Groening" /> While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favourites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending "drives them [the fans] crazy," since they do not know whether or not the the episode is canonical.<ref name="Selman" /> In 2007, Homer's line "Oh, I smell barbeque!" was included in Bobby Bryant of ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'''s list "20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson".
