The '''American Diabetes Association''' ('''ADA''') is a United States-based association working to fight the consequences of [[diabetes]] and to help those affected by diabetes. The Association funds research to manage, cure and prevent diabetes (including [[type 1 diabetes]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[gestational diabetes]], and [[pre-diabetes]]); delivers services to hundreds of communities; provides information for both patients and health care professionals; and advocates on behalf of people denied their rights because of diabetes.<ref name="diabetes.org">http://www.diabetes.org/aboutus.jsp?WTLPromo=HEADER_aboutus</ref>

In 2011 it was estimated that 25.8 million Americans have diabetes, and another 79 million have prediabetes.<ref name="diabetes.org">http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/diabetes-statistics</ref>

==History and mission==
Formed in 1940, the ADA was founded by 28 physicians.<ref>American Diabetes Association: ''The Journey & the Dream: A history of the American Diabetes Association'', page 23. American Diabetes Association, 1990.</ref> During its first 30 years, the Association limited its membership to physicians, health professionals and corporations. In 1970, the Association underwent a reorganization during which membership was expanded to include general members. Now the ADA is a volunteer-driven organization based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with about 90 local offices across the United States.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/in-my-community/</ref>

The mission of the ADA is to prevent and cure diabetes and to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes.<ref name="diabetes.org"/> To fulfill this mission, the Association funds research, publishes scientific findings, provides information and other services to people with diabetes, their families, health professionals and the public. The Association is also actively involved in advocating for scientific research and for the rights of people with diabetes.<ref name="diabetes.org"/> The Association acts on its mission through a number of critical programs and activities that are directed to a broad range of constituents, including consumers, research scientists, health care professionals, corporations and communities.

In 1994, the [[Chronicle of Philanthropy]], an industry publication, study showed that the American Diabetes Association was ranked as the 18th "most popular charity/non-profit in America" from over 100 charities researched with 33.8% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing Love and Like A Lot for the American Diabetes Association.<ref>The Charities Americans Like Most And Least, The Chronicle of Philanthropy, December 13, 1996</ref>

==Fund-raising==
The ADA is America's leading [[501(c)]]3 nonprofit charity providing diabetes research, information and advocacy.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/donate/</ref>

The ADA raises most monies themselves and their overall fundraising expenses are 27%, with 73 cents of every dollar raised being used for research and programs.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/about-us/2011-ada-annual-report.pdf</ref> However, they engage telemarketers at very large costs in order to bring new donors into their rolls. In one instance, the ADA entered into contract with [[InfoCision]], a telemarketing firm that works closely with nonprofits, whereby only 15% of the expected funds raised would be given to the ADA with the other 85% being kept by the telemarketing firm. Furthermore, the telemarketers are instructed to lie to prospective donors regarding how much of their donation will go to the ADA.<ref>[[Bloomberg Markets]], [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-12/charities-deceive-donors-unaware-money-goes-to-a-telemarketer.html/ "Charities Deceive Donors Unaware Money Goes to a Telemarketer"]. Retrieved 2012-09-16.</ref> When questioned by [[NBC|NBC's]] [[Lisa Myers]] about this campaign, a representative from the ADA expressed no regrets saying in part that "this program is a teenie weenie part of what they do; it's about bringing more people into the organization," and stating that the program was not misleading despite the fact that prospective donors are being lied to regarding what percentage of their donation will be going to the ADA. As for what the ADA's response would be to donors who feel duped, the representative said that the ADA would say "thank you for the gift, it's making a difference, every single penny makes a positive impact." <ref>[[Lisa Myers|Myers, Lisa]], [http://www.nbc.com/news-sports/today-show/2012/09/donors-unaware-charity-money-goes-to-telemarketer/ "Donors unaware charity money goes to telemarketer"], NBC ''Today Show'', September 12, 2012. Retrieved 2012-09-16.</ref>

==Research==
=== ADA-funded research ===
The ADA Research Program supports basic and clinical diabetes research aimed at preventing, treating, and curing diabetes. The diabetes research projects the Association supports cover the spectrum from islet cell biology and transplantation techniques, to studies in education and behavioral issues.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-research/ada-funded.jsp?</ref> The Association has increased support for diabetes research from providing $18&nbsp;million in 1999 to making $34.6 million available for diabetes research in 2012.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.diabetes.org/news-research/research/</ref>

The ADA<U+2019>s [[research funding]] program is designed to complement the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) diabetes research program by supporting new investigators and new research ideas.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> With support from the Association, investigators are often able to prove that their ideas are solid enough to get more substantial funding from the [[United States federal government]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Research Foundation===
Founded in October 1994, the ADA Research Foundation (also a [[501(c)]]3 nonprofit) was created to substantially accelerate the Association's ability to raise major gifts to directly fund diabetes research.<ref name="ReferenceB">http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-research/ADA-Research-Foundation/researchfoundation.jsp</ref> The mission of the Research Foundation is to ensure the availability of funds necessary for the full exploration of all the scientific possibilities that diabetes research is generating.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Donations contributed to the Research Foundation help support more than 406 awards at more than 164 research institutions across the country, all working toward a day without diabetes. All non-research costs associated with the Research Program are paid through the Association's general fund.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

===Scientific Sessions===
Every year the ADA hosts the world<U+2019>s largest scientific and medical diabetes meeting.<ref>http://professional.diabetes.org/Congress_Display.aspx?TYP=9&CID=60976</ref> This meeting, known as Scientific Sessions, brings together thousands of clinicians, researchers, scientists and other medical professionals from all 50 states and 111 countries for five days of sessions, oral presentations, poster presentations and exhibits.<ref>http://professional.diabetes.org/Meeting_ListByType.aspx?ctyp=1</ref>

==Programs and activities==
=== Center for Information and Community Support ===
On average, each year more than 300,000 people contact the Association with questions and concerns, or to seek support or direction regarding diabetes and its management.<ref name="ReferenceC">http://www.diabetes.org/about-us/center-for-information-community-support.html</ref> In 2011, the Center for Information and Community Support (previously named the National Call Center) fielded an average of 20,000 calls per month.

The Center for Information and Community Support is a free service staffed by highly-trained personnel, who answer non-medical questions in English or Spanish. Call Center hours of operation are Monday <U+2013> Friday, 8:30&nbsp;am to 8&nbsp;pm [[eastern time]], with an automated phone system including basic information 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at 1-800-DIABETES (800-342-2383).<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In 2009, the Center began to use [[online chat]] as a new means of communication with people who have questions about diabetes.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/about-us/center-for-information-community-support.html</ref>

===Family Link===
The ADA's Family Link program provides information to families about living with diabetes and managing diabetes at school, and links them to other families who are also living with diabetes.<ref name="Family Link">http://www.diabetes.org/family-link/about-family-link.jsp</ref> With [[message boards]], local Family Link events,<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/family-link/find-family-link.jsp</ref> tool kits for families of children newly diagnosed with diabetes, parent-to-parent [[mentor]] programs, school initiatives that advocate and train safety at school,<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/discrimination/school/scrights.jsp</ref> and a safe online [[social networking]] site exclusively for youth with diabetes called Planet D,<ref>http://tracker.diabetes.org/index.php</ref> Family Link provides comprehensive support.<ref name="Family Link"/> The American Diabetes Association also provides diabetes camps nationwide and is the largest provider of diabetes camps in the world.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-camp/diabetes-camp.jsp</ref>

===Community initiatives===
The ADA offers programs and resources specially designed to target high-risk communities, including African-American, [[Hispanic and Latino American]], Native American, Asian American and [[Pacific Islander]] communities.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/communityprograms-and-localevents.jsp</ref> There are also programs for the workplace and in the neighborhood, as well as events and programs that are run by local offices.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/communityprograms-and-localevents/waw-default.jsp</ref>

==Events==
=== Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes ===
Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes is the ADA's largest fund-raising event. Most walks take place in the fall, with more than 150 walks taking place in over 100 markets around the United States in 2009.<ref>http://stepout.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=OUT_lm_wherewewalk</ref><ref>http://www.volunteermatch.org/search/opp452373.jsp</ref> It raises about $20&nbsp;million annually.<ref>http://mydiabetessocialnetwork.ning.com/events/step-out-walk-to-fight</ref>

===Tour de Cure===
[[Tour de Cure]] is a series of fund-raising cycling events held in 40 states nationwide to benefit the ADA.<ref>http://tour.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TC_homepage</ref> The Tour is a ride, not a race, with routes designed for everyone from the occasional rider to the experienced cyclist. In 2009, Tour de Cure events across the nation began to recognize participants who have diabetes by awarding them with red shirts or cycling jerseys to signify that they are Red Riders.<ref>http://tour.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TC_redrider</ref>

===Diabetes EXPO===
Diabetes EXPO is a one-day tradeshow-like exposition for people with diabetes providing an array of diabetes-related products, services and information. In 2009, 21 Diabetes Expos have taken place or are planned in major markets throughout the United States.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/communityprograms-and-localevents/diabetesexpo.jsp</ref>

===School Walk for Diabetes===
School Walk for Diabetes is a [[K-12]] educational [[school fundraising]] program that promotes healthy living, school spirit and community involvement. While raising money for the ADA, students learn about diabetes and the importance of making healthy choices including eating nutritious foods and exercising every day.<ref>http://schoolwalk.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=SW_homepage</ref>

===BAD Ride===
The Bikers Against Diabetes (BAD) Ride is a motorcycle fund-raising ride and family festival of the ADA.<ref>http://badride.diabetes.org/site/PageServer?pagename=BR_homepage</ref> This event brings bikers together to support the search for a cure for diabetes, with a full day of riding, entertainment, food and many other activities.

===Father of the Year===
Since 1999, the ADA has partnered with the National Father's Day Council to host the [[American Father of the Year award|Father of the Year]] Awards dinner.

==Advocacy==
Advocacy plays an integral role in the Association's efforts to fulfill its mission. Diabetes Advocates around the country work to increase funding to prevent, treat and cure diabetes; to improve access to health care; and to eliminate discrimination against people with diabetes at school, work or elsewhere in their lives.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/advocacy.jsp</ref>

===Discrimination===
The ADA builds networks, hosts workshops, and engages with its volunteers to fight discrimination based on diabetes. This includes discrimination in school, in the workplace, obtaining private and commercial [[driver's licenses]], in public accommodation settings and correctional institutions.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/discrimination.jsp</ref>  The ADA also works to improve access of diabetes patients to insulin by lobbying for non-medical professionals to be allowed to administer insulin (after receiving basic training), which has put it at odds with the [[American Nurses Association]].

===Federal government advocacy and state legislation===
The Association<U+2019>s advocacy efforts span a broad range of issues that may or may not vary depending on geographic location. Advocacy initiatives include <U+2013> but are not limited to <U+2013> research funding, health care costs and reform, prevention initiatives and discrimination.<ref>http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/federal_legislation/overview.jsp</ref><ref>http://www.diabetes.org/advocacy-and-legalresources/state-legislation/overview.jsp</ref>

===Call to Congress===
