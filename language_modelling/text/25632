'''Gary Roberts''' (born May 23, 1966) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] player who played 21 seasons in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) for the [[Calgary Flames]], [[Carolina Hurricanes]], [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], [[Florida Panthers]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. Renowned for his physical fitness during his career, Roberts has become a high performance trainer for players at all levels of the sport.

Roberts was member of [[Memorial Cup]] and [[Minto Cup]] winning teams as Canadian [[junior hockey]] and [[box lacrosse]] champions, respectively. He was a first round selection of the Calgary Flames, 12th overall, at the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]] and played ten seasons in Calgary. Roberts was a member of the Flames' 1989 [[Stanley Cup]] championship team and made two of his three [[NHL All-Star Game]] appearances as a representative of the team. A serious neck injury forced him to miss the majority of two seasons, and while his return earned him the 1996 [[Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy]] for perseverance and dedication to the game, he was forced into retirement following the [[1995<U+2013>96 NHL season|1995<U+2013>96 season]].

After sitting out a full season, Roberts successfully returned to the NHL in 1997 as a member of the Carolina Hurricanes, with whom he played three seasons. Stints in Toronto, Florida and Pittsburgh followed, and Roberts ended his career in 2009 as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He played 11 seasons following his comeback, finishing with [[List of NHL players with 1000 games played|1,224 games played]], 438 [[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] and 910 [[point (ice hockey)|points]].

Roberts did not last much longer in Florida as, following a 40-point season in 2005<U+2013>06,<ref name="NHLStats" /> the Panthers sought to trade him to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] late in the [[2006<U+2013>07 NHL season|2006<U+2013>07 season]]. Several members of the Penguins, including [[Mario Lemieux]] and general manager [[Ray Shero]], sought to convince Roberts to agree to the deal as he was initially unsure about leaving Florida but ultimately agreed to the trade.<ref name="BadgerBob">{{cite news |last=Starkey |first=Joe |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11283717.html |title=Roberts inspired by Badger Bob |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2007-04-11 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> The deal was completed at the February 27, 2007, trade deadline as Pittsburgh sent prospect [[Noah Welch]] to Florida in exchange for Roberts.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrison |first=Scott |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/trade-deadline/2007/02/panthers_ship_roberts_to_pengu.html |title=Panthers ship Roberts to Penguins |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2013-02-27 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref> He was brought in to add a leadership presence to a young Penguins team.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rossi |first=Rob |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11275639.html |title=Pens' Roberts quietly guiding young team |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2007-03-31 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> He finished the regular season with 13 points in 19 games in Pittsburgh and helped the Penguins reach the playoffs for the first time in six years.<ref name="NHLStats" /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8867294.html |title=Penguins reach playoffs after six-year march |work=China Daily |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref>

Injuries again hampered Roberts in [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season|2007<U+2013>08]]. He missed time early in the season due to a viral infection, then broke his left fibula in a game against the [[Buffalo Sabres]].  He was praised for skating off the ice without assistance despite the injury, but missed over two months of action while his leg healed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rossi |first=Rob |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15460418.html |title=Pens' Roberts plans late-season impact |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> Appearing in only 38 games during the regular season,<ref name="NHLStats" /> Roberts returned from the injury in time to score two goals and lead Pittsburgh to a victory in the first game of its opening round playoff series against the [[Ottawa Senators]].

Pittsburgh opted not to re-sign Roberts to a new contract following the season and traded both he and [[Ryan Malone]] <U+2013> who was also a pending free agent <U+2013> to the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] in exchange for a third round draft pick on June 28, 2008.

Nine days after playing his final NHL game, an 8<U+2013>6 win in Calgary where he recorded an assist,  Roberts announced his retirement on March 10, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/03/09/sp-roberts-gary-retire.html |title=Gary Roberts retires from NHL |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-03}}</ref>

==Fitness and training==
Roberts entered his first NHL training camp with the Flames in 1984 believing his summer lacrosse schedule was enough to keep him in proper hockey game shape. Coach [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] disagreed and hauled him in front of his peers as an example of someone who had not committed to being a hockey player.<ref name="BadgerBob" /> He was initially upset, but grew to realize that Johnson was correct, particularly in that he was not particularly focused on his fitness.<ref>{{cite news |last=LeBrun |first=Pierre |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/blog/_/name/lebrun_pierre/id/3967586/was-winner |title=Gary Roberts retires: 'He was a winner' |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref> The criticism inspired Roberts to dedicate himself to personal training,<ref name="BadgerBob" /> and carried a reputation for being obsessed with nutrition and physical fitness throughout his career.<ref>{{cite news |last=Zeisberger |first=Mike |url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/Pittsburgh/2007/03/31/3880062-sun.html |title=Leafs' loss is Pens' gain |work=Toronto Sun |date=2007-03-31 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref> He credited his fitness and nutrition regimen with helping him extend his career another 13 years after his first retirement.<ref>{{cite web |last=Grande |first=Laura |url=http://www.todaysparent.com/family/family-health/tips-from-a-hockey-pro-creating-a-healthy-lifestyle-for-kids/ |title=Tips from a hockey pro: Creating a healthy lifestyle for kids |work=Today's Parent |date=2013-04-25 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref>

As a player, Roberts helped train his peers during off-seasons. He was a member of the [[Dallas Stars]]' staff as the team's player development consultant during the [[2010<U+2013>11 NHL season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stars.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=540640 |title=Roberts added as Player Development Consultant |publisher=Dallas Stars Hockey Club |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref> One of Roberts' early disciples, Tampa's [[Steven Stamkos]], developed into a 50 goal player in his first season after training with Roberts and led to numerous players seeking to train with him.  His growing reputation as a personal trainer led to the creation of the Gary Roberts High Performance Centre and Fitness Institute in [[North York, Ontario]] where he trains junior and professional players, including several in the NHL.<ref name="ToughTraining">{{cite news |last=Rosen |first=Dan |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=640438 |title=NHL stars seek out Gary Roberts' tough training |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2012-08-27 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Roberts has been married twice and has three children. He and his first wife Tamra have a daughter, Jordan, though the couple were divorced while Roberts played in Toronto.<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Ken |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/439028659.html?FMT=ABS |title=Roberts staying in Florida; Panthers GM says almost no chance for Leafs trade |work=Toronto Star |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}{{subscription required}}</ref> With his second wife, Michelle, he has two sons: Noah and Sam.<ref name="WhitbySHOF" /> Michelle assists her husband at the training centre.<ref name="ToughTraining" /> Roberts hosts an annual charity golf tournament in [[Uxbridge, Ontario]], in support of [[Canadian Tire]]'s Jumpstart program, which helps young people get involved in sports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.woodensticks.com/?page_id=2951 |title=Gary Roberts Charity Tournament |publisher=Wooden Sticks Golf Course |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> He is an honoured member of the Whitby Sports Hall of Fame, inducted in 2010.<ref name="WhitbySHOF" />
