There have been many varied '''voting systems at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]'''. Currently, the winner of the Contest is selected by means of a [[positional voting system]]. Each country ranks all the entries and assigns twelve points to their favourite entry, ten points to their second favourite entry, and eight down to one point to their third to tenth favourites. Countries are not allowed to vote for themselves.

The current method for ranking entries, first introduced for the final in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]] (and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Semi-finals|semi-finals]]), is a 50/50 combination of both [[televoting|telephone vote]] and the votes of [[jury|juries]] made up of music professionals.<ref name="2010 voting">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=4533&_t=Exclusive%3A+Juries+also+get+50%25+stake+in+Semi-Final+result!|title=Exclusive: Juries also get 50% stake in Semi-Final result!|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=2009-10-11|publisher=''[[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]]''|accessdate=2009-10-11}}</ref> In the past, small demographically-balanced juries made up of ordinary people were used to rank the entries. After the widespread implementation of telephone vote in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], juries were only used in case of televoting malfunctions or a weak telephone system. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], [[Eircom]]'s telephone polls system ceased to operate normally; the Irish broadcaster, [[RT<U+00C9>]], did not receive the votes on time and instead used the votes of a panel of judges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/may/30/russia.arts|title=Vote switch 'stole Tatu's Eurovision win'|last=Nick|first=Paton Walsh|date=2003-05-30|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''}}</ref> In the first years of the telephone vote, the lines were opened for a short period after the performance of the final song; since the 2010 Contest, the lines have opened before the first song, allowing viewers to vote during the performances.

The [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956 Contest]] did not have regional voting. The [[BBC]] had used the idea of contacting regional juries by telephone in their national competition to choose their [[Eurovision Song Contest 1956|1956]] song. The EBU later adopted the idea of contacting the international juries by telephone, and was used from the next contest, and used until [[1993]]. In [[1994]], the Contest saw the first satellite link-up to juries. 

For the announcement of the votes, the [[List of Eurovision Song Contest presenters|presenters]] of the Contest connect by satellite to each country in turn, inviting the spokesperson to read out that country's votes in [[French language|French]] or [[English language|English]]. Originally, the presenters would then repeat the votes in both languages, but since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]], due to time constraints, the votes have only translated from English to French and vice-versa instead of repeating the votes in their original language. To offset the extension to voting time caused by the increased number of participating countries, from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] Contest onwards, each country's one- to seven-point votes have been added automatically to the scoreboard as that country's spokesperson was introduced, with only the eight-, ten- and twelve-point scores being read out. The scoreboard displays the number of points each country has received and, since [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], a progress bar indicating the number of countries that have voted.

==Tie-breakers==
In the event of a tie for first place after all the points have been announced, there is a [[tie-break]] procedure. It was realised that a tie-break procedure need be predetermined following the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1969|1969 Contest]], where [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]], the [[Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest|Netherlands]], [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest|Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] tied for first place. Since no tie-breaking system had been previously decided, it was determined that all four countries be jointly awarded the title. In protest, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal did not participate the following year.

The current tie-breaking rule is that, in the event that two or more countries tie for first place, the song that received points from the greater number of countries is the winner. This system is sometimes called the "[[count-back]]". If there is still a tie, the second tie-breaker is to count the number of countries who assigned twelve points to each entry in the tie. Tie-breaks continue with ten points, eight points, and so on until the tie is resolved. Ties for other places are only officially resolved if they matter for qualification purposes.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], the tie-break procedure was put into action when [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] and France had both scored 146 points at the end of voting. At the time, the tie-break rule was slightly different: the first tie-break rule (the country voted for by the most other countries wins) was not yet in use. Both Sweden and France had received the maximum of twelve points four times. Only when the number of ten-point scores had been counted could Sweden, represented by [[Carola H<U+00E4>ggkvist|Carola]] with the song "[[F<U+00E5>ngad av en stormvind]]", acclaim its third victory, having received five ten-point scores against France's two. Thus, the French song, "[[Le Dernier qui a parl<U+00E9>...]]" performed by [[Amina Annabi|Amina]], came second with the smallest ever losing margin.

==Nul points==
{{Unreferenced-section|date=December 2008}}
Since each of the participating countries casts a series of preference votes, under the current scoring system it is rare that a song fails to receive any votes at all (for example, if the points in the final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010 Contest]] had been randomly allocated, with 39 countries voting on the 25 entries, the probability of scoring no points would be approximately 1 in 530 million).  Under the modern rules this means that the song failed to make the top ten most popular songs in ''any'' country.

Under the second-most-used scoring system, however (see below), jurors gave points individually and only to their single favourite song, a system which might be expected to result in songs regularly not being awarded any points.  Even so, it was not until 1967 that that occurred under that scoring system &mdash; the seventh year of its operation.

When it does happen, it is known as ''nul points'' (pronounced as if French, as {{IPA-fr|nyl pw<U+025B><U+0303>|}}). It should be noted, however, that the phrase ''nul points'' (nor, for that matter, any reference to a country having ''not'' received points from another country's voters) is never actually read out during the presentation of the Contest. Besides ''nul points'' would be incorrectly spelled in French, and the correct spelling (''nul point'') is never used as an equivalent of "no points" or "zero points" (which would be ''pas de point'' or ''z<U+00E9>ro point'').

Entries which received ''nul points'', since the introduction of the current scoring system in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975]] are as follows:
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], Norway's "[[Mil etter mil]]" by [[Jahn Teigen]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1981|1981]], Norway's "[[Aldri i livet]]" by [[Finn Kalvik]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982|1982]], Finland's "[[Nuku pommiin]]" by [[Kojo (singer)|Kojo]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]], two entries: Turkey's "[[Opera (song)|Opera]]" by [[<U+00C7>etin Alp]] and [[Short Wave]] and Spain's "[[<U+00BF>Qui<U+00E9>n maneja mi barca?]]" by [[Remedios Amaya]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]], Turkey's "[[<U+015E>ark<U+0131>m Sevgi <U+00DC>st<U+00FC>ne]]" by [[Seyyal Taner & Locomotif|Seyyal Taner and Grup Locomotif]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1988|1988]], Austria's "[[Lisa Mona Lisa]]" by [[Wilfried]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]], Iceland's "[[<U+00DE>a<U+00F0> sem enginn s<U+00E9>r]]" by [[Dan<U+00ED>el <U+00C1>g<U+00FA>st]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991]], Austria's "[[Venedig im Regen]]" by [[Thomas Forstner]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], Lithuania's "[[Lop<U+0161>in<U+0117> mylimai]]" by [[Ovidijus Vy<U+0161>niauskas]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]], two entries: Norway's "[[San Francisco (Tor Endresen song)|San Francisco]]" by [[Tor Endresen]] and Portugal's "[[Antes do adeus]]" by [[C<U+00E9>lia Lawson]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]], Switzerland's "[[Lass' ihn]]" by [[Gunvor Guggisberg|Gunvor]].
* In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], United Kingdom's "[[Cry Baby (Jemini song)|Cry Baby]]" by [[Jemini]].
* In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004#Semi-final|semi-final]], Switzerland's "[[Celebrate (Piero Esteriore & The MusicStars song)|Celebrate]]" by [[Piero Esteriore|Piero]] & [[The MusicStars]]
* In the first [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]] [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009#Semi-final_1|semi-final]], Czech Republic's "[[Aven Romale]]" by [[Gypsy.cz]].

In his book ''Nul Points'', comic writer [[Tim Moore (writer)|Tim Moore]] interviews the first twelve of these performers to find out if their Eurovision score was the end of their music career or just the beginning.

Since the creation of a semi-final in 2004 and two semi-finals in 2008, more than thirty countries vote each night - even the countries eliminated or already qualified. Thus occurrences of nul points become rarer; it would require a song to place less than tenth in every country. In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 semi-final]], Switzerland's "Celebrate" by Piero Esteriore & The MusicStars received nul points, but only 32 countries out of 36 voted, and in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009#Semi-final_1|first 2009 semifinal]], where only 20 countries voted, Czech Republic's "Aven Romale" by Gypsy.cz received nul points.

==Regional block voting==

Greece and Cyprus invariably exchange points; since 1986, the two countries have always exchanged the maximum twelve points between themselves whenever possible. Several countries can be organised into voting blocks which regularly award each other high points:<ref name="Derek" />

*Cyprus and Greece;
*Ireland and UK;
*Andorra and Spain;
*San Marino and Italy;
*Belgium and the Netherlands;
*Nordic states: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland;
*Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania;
*Balkan countries:
*:A core contingent of former Yugoslavian countries, most notably Serbia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Croatia;
*Former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Armenia, and Moldova;
*Romania and Moldova, acting as a bridge between the Balkan and Warsaw Pact states;
*Georgia and Lithuania;
*Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Bj<U+00F8>rn Erichsen, former director of Eurovision TV, disagrees with the assertion that regional block voting significantly affects the outcome of the contest, arguing that Russia's first victory in 2008 was only possible with votes from thirty-eight of the participating countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news/belgrade-2008?id=1135|first = Sietse|last = Bakker|title = Eurovision TV Director responds to allegations on voting|accessdate = 23 May 2010}}</ref>

The most-used voting system other than the current one was that used for the [[1969]] contest. This system had been used between 1957 and 1961, and later between 1967 and 1969. Ten jurors in each country each gave a single vote to their favourite song.  In [[1969]] this resulted in four countries tying for first place (UK, Netherlands, France, and Spain), and there was no tie-break procedure. A "second round" voting in the event of a tie was introduced to this system in 1970.

Between 1962 and 1966, a voting system closer to the current system was used. In 1962 each country awarded its top three one, two and three points; in 1963 the top five were awarded one, two, three, four and five points, and from 1964 until 1966, each country awarded its top three one, three and five points. With the latter system, there was an additional rule that each country could choose not to give points to three countries, but award points to two countries (giving one a three and the other a six).  In 1965 Belgium awarded the United Kingdom six, and Italy three points. The system also permitted a country to give a single award of 9 points, but it never happened.

The [[1971]], [[1972]], and [[1973]] contests saw the jurors "in vision" for the first time. Each country was represented by two jurors - one older than 25 and one younger, with at least ten years' difference in their ages. Each juror gave a minimum of one point and a maximum of five points for each song. In [[1974]] the previous system of ten jurors was used, and the following year the current system was introduced. Spokespeople were next seen on screen in [[1994]] by satellite link up to the venue.

With the introduction of two semi-finals in 2008 a new method of selecting finalists was created.  The top nine songs ranked by televote qualified, along with one song selected by the back-up juries. This method in most cases meant that the tenth song in the televote placing failed to qualify, and attracted some criticism, especially from [[Republic of Macedonia|F.Y.R Macedonia]], who in both years placed 10th in the televote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14111|title=FYR Macedonia threatens Eurovision withdrawal|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2009-05-20|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=24 January 2010}}</ref> In 2010 the system used in the 2009 final, where the winner is selected by a combination of televoting and jury votes, was also used to select the semi-finalists.<ref name="2010 voting" />
