"'''Because of You'''" is a song performed by American singer-songwriter [[Kelly Clarkson]]. It was written by Clarkson, David Hodges and Ben Moody while the production was handled by Hodges and Moody. The song was released on August 16, 2005, as the fourth single (third in Europe) from Clarkson's second studio album, ''[[Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson song)|Breakaway]]''. Clarkson originally wrote the first version of "Because of You" when she was 16 years old in order to cope with her parents' divorce. She wanted to include the song on her first album, ''[[Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)|Thankful]]'', but her request was not accepted by her label. She had to polish the song with Hodges and Moody before successfully convincing her label to include it in ''Breakaway''. 

Lyrically, "Because of You" explores emotional pain from a damaging relationship and critics deemed it is a fiery ode to Clarkson's father. The song begins with a piano-led melody and as it launches into the chorus, a roaring guitar is evident. Critically, "Because of You" garnered positive reviews by most music critics who generally praised Clarkson's vocals. The song performed well commercially; in the United States, it peaked at number seven on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over 1.5 million digital downloads. It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Internationally, "Because of You" was also a commercial success, topping the charts in the Netherlands and Switzerland and reaching the top five in Australia, Canada, Ireland and United Kingdom. 

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Vadim Perelman]]. Clarkson wrote the treatment for the video herself in order to reflect the pain that the she felt due to her parents' divorce. The video's plot centers on Clarkson engaging in a heated argument with her husband in front of her child before realizing that she was repeating her parents' mistake. It won in the category for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. The song was performed live at numerous venues, including the [[My December Tour]] (2007) as well as the [[All I Ever Wanted Tour]] (2009). It was covered by several artists including [[Ronan Parke]], who is a runner-up in the [[Britain's Got Talent (series 5)|fifth series]] of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.

==Critical reception==
Film Laureate of Blogcritics considered "Because of You" and "Where is Your Heart" as his two favourite songs from ''Breakaway,'' writing "[Clarkson] commands these two songs like a seasoned pro and directs herself in her songs the way Steven Spielberg said Barbra Streisand directs herself in her songs as if she's directing an actor in a movie."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/music/article/review-kelly-clarkson-breakaway/|title=Review: Kelly Clarkson - Breakaway |date=July 13, 2005|accessdate=January 4, 2012| last=Laureate|first=Film|publisher=Blogcritics. Technorati, Inc}}</ref> Dave Donnelly of [[Sputnikmusic]] compared the song to [[Evanescence]]'s "[[My Immortal]]" (2003). He added that Clarkson managed to take the piano-driven song in a different direction with a "stormy, hard blues vocal... avoiding the typical raised-key final chorus clich<U+00E9> along the way".<ref name="Sput"/> On the other hand, Bill Lamb of About.com lambasted the lyrics of the song and considered it as a 16-year-old work rather than an accomplished pop songwriter.<ref name="About.com"/> Christa L. Titus of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' lauded the song for its absence of schmaltz factor, "only a potent, pained, grown-up anthem of gross betrayal and loss." She concluded her review, writing "it is time for Clarkson to return to No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; she has certainly become the most consistent hope for top 40 staple status."<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Titus|first=Christa |date=August 27, 2005|title= Review Spotlights - Singles|magazine= Billboard |volume= 117|issue= No. 35|pages=80 |id= |url= |accessdate=January 7, 2012|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> Critics also lauded Clarkson's vocal prowess in the song.

<blockquote>
"It's very close to home [for me]. I OK'd it with my family and everything because they think it's important, because we're obviously very different now than we were when we were younger.

===Synopsis===
[[File:kellyclarksonbecauseofyouvideo.png|thumb|right|230px|Clarkson and younger Clarkson (played by Kennedy N<U+00F6>el) in the music video of "Because of You."]]
The video starts at the Clarkson's household. There, she and her partner are engaged in a heated argument, and at one point he threatens to smash a picture of the family. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father, who tosses it into the sink, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills and crying in front of the younger Clarkson. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves; although the younger Clarkson tries to get him to stay, he pulls away. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present. There, time unfreezes and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self.<ref name="video"/>

Elizabeth Black of [[VH1]] ranked the music video at number four in her list of "Five Emotive Music Video Performances." She reasoned, "Kelly Clarkson practically sobs her way through this hurt and angry expression of the pain that the narrator<U+2019>s father has caused her through his absence and lack of love."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.vh1.com/2011-07-22/tearin-up-my-heart-the-top-five-emotive-music-video-performances/|title=Tearin<U+2019> Up My Heart: The Top Five Emotive Music Video Performances |date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=January 8, 2012|last=Black|first=Elizabeth|publisher=[[VH1]].

==Live performances==
Clarkson performed "Because of You" at the [[48th Grammy Awards]] which took place on February 8, 2006, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Donning a red dress and singing from beside a grand piano, her performance in that event garnered positive reviews from critics. Elysa Gardner of ''[[USA Today]]'' lauded Clarkson's performance and ranked it as one of the three best performances, writing, "The pre-performance clip of a girlish-looking Clarkson emphasized how little Kelly has matured. The girl most likely to escape the ''[[American Idol]]'' stigma was in fine, creamy voice, and kept the Mariah-esque riffing to a minimum."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2006-02-09-three-best_x.htm|title=Three best, and the rest|date=February 9, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2012|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''.

In 2007, Clarkson recorded "Because of You" as a duet with American country singer [[Reba McEntire]]. The song was released as a single on May 15, 2007, as the lead single for McEntire's album, ''[[Reba: Duets]]''. The duet garnered mixed reviews from critics who felt that even though McEntire's singing was pleasant, she brought nothing new to the song. At the [[50th Grammy Awards]], McEntire and Clarkson received a nomination in the category of Best Vocal Country Collaboration for the song. In the United States, "Because of You" became McEntire's seventh song to peak at number two at [[Hot Country Songs]]. It also became Clarkson's first song to appear on the chart. The music video was directed by [[Roman White]] which depicts McEntire and Clarkson as two retro Hollywood lounge singers. The plot centers on Clarkson's relationship with her abusive partner which is witnessed by McEntire. The song was performed live by the two singers in various venues, notably at the [[Academy of Country Music#2007|42nd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards]] and during their [[2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour]].
