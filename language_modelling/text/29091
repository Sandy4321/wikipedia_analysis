In molecular biology, the domain B, refers to the [[immunoglobulin]]-binding [[ protein domain|domain]] found in the ''Staphylococcus aureus'' [[virulence factor]] [[protein]] A (SpA). Hence, it is abbreviated to SpA<sub>B</sub>.
== Function== 
SpA<sub>B</sub> enables the''Staphylococcus aureus'' bacteria to evade  the host's immune system through the disruption of [[opsonization]] and [[phagocytosis]]. It does this though SpA<sub>B</sub> binding to  the Fc fragment of IgG.
==Structure==
The B domain of SpA (SpAB) consists of three a-helices which are retained upon interaction with the Fc fragment of IgG. Protein A contains five highly [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] [[immunoglobulin]] (Ig)-binding [[protein domain|domains]] in tandem (designated [[protein domains|domains]] E, D, A, B and C), which share a common [[secondary structure|structure]] consisting of three [[Alpha helix|helices]] in a closed left-handed twist. Protein A can exist in both [[secreted]] and [[membrane-bound]] forms, and has two distinct Ig-binding activities: each domain can [[Molecular binding|bind]] Fc-gamma (the constant region of IgG involved in [[Effector (biology)|effector]] functions) and Fab (the Ig fragment responsible for [[antigen]] recognition).<ref name="pmid10805799">{{cite journal | author = Graille M, Stura EA, Corper AL, Sutton BJ, Taussig MJ, Charbonnier JB, Silverman GJ | title = Crystal structure of a Staphylococcus aureus protein A domain complexed with the Fab fragment of a human IgM antibody: structural basis for recognition of B-cell receptors and superantigen activity | journal = Proc.

The [[native state]] of the B domain, deviates a lot since its inter-helical angles fluctuate. It appears to be relatively thermodynamically more stable than the E domain. The increased stability of the B domain may be due to heightened
mobility, and therefore entropy, in the native state and decreased mobility entropy in the more compact denatured state. <ref name="pmid10618383">{{cite journal| author=Alonso DO, Daggett V| title=Staphylococcal protein A: unfolding pathways, unfolded states, and differences between the B and E domains. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 2000 | volume= 97 | issue= 1 | pages= 133-8 | pmid=10618383 | doi= | pmc=PMC26628 | url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=10618383  }} </ref>
