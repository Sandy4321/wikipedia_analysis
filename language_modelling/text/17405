The work took him more than twenty years to finish.<ref name=li>{{cite web |last=Li |first=Jiemin |title=<U+6768><U+4F2F><U+5CFB><U+FF1A><U+53E4><U+7C4D><U+6574><U+7406><U+5F00><U+65B0><U+7BC7> |url=http://news.guoxue.com/article.php?articleid=30218 |publisher=Guoxue |accessdate=2014-04-22 |language=Chinese |date=2012-02-02}}</ref> His commentaries of the ''[[Analects of Confucius]]'' and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' are also highly influential.<ref name=li/>

==Early life and education==
Yang Bojun was born in September 1909 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province.<ref name=li/> He was the eldest son of Yang Shugu (<U+6768><U+6811><U+7A40>), and was also known as '''Yang Dechong''' (<U+6768><U+5FB7><U+5D07>).<ref name=df>{{cite web |last=Yang |first=Fengbin |title=<U+6768><U+6811><U+8FBE><U+5148><U+751F><U+4E4B><U+540E><U+7684><U+6768><U+5BB6> |url=http://epaper.dfdaily.com/dfzb/html/2010-01/17/content_184072.htm |publisher=Dongfang Daily |accessdate=27 April 2014 |language=Chinese |date=17 January 2010}}</ref> Starting in childhood, he was taught by his grandfather to read Confucian classics such as the ''Analects'', the ''[[Book of Poetry]]'', and the ''Zuo Zhuan''.<ref name=li/><ref name=yang>{{cite web |last=Yang |first=Bojun |title=<U+6211><U+548C><U+300A><U+5DE6><U+4F20><U+300B>|trans_title=''Zuo Zhuan'' and I |url=http://site.douban.com/123494/widget/notes/4499173/note/176288619/ |publisher=Douban |accessdate=27 April 2014 |language=Chinese |date=6 October 2011}}</ref> 

In 1926, he passed the examination to enter the Chinese department of [[Peking University]], where he studied under prominent scholars such as [[Qian Xuantong]], Chen Yuan ([[:zh:<U+9648><U+57A3>|<U+9648><U+57A3>]]), and the philologist [[Huang Kan]]. He graduated in 1932. However, the person who influenced him the most was his uncle [[Yang Shuda]] ([[:zh:<U+6768><U+6811><U+8FBE>|<U+6768><U+6811><U+8FBE>]]), also a well-known philologist.<ref name=li/>

==Career==
In 1953, Yang became an associate professor at the Chinese department of Peking University. He began writing ''Lunyu Yizhu'' (<U+8BBA><U+8BED><U+8BD1><U+6CE8>, "Translation and Annotation of the Analects"), which was published in 1958 by [[Zhonghua Book Company]].<ref name=li/>

When the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] began in 1957, Yang and three of his cousins (sons of Yang Shuda) were labelled "Rightists".<ref name=df/> Yang was transferred to [[Lanzhou University]] in remote [[Gansu]] province, where he continued to teach in the Chinese department. In [[Lanzhou]] he wrote ''Mengzi Yizhu'' (<U+5B5F><U+5B50><U+8BD1><U+6CE8>, "Translation and Annotation of the Mencius"), which was published by Zhonghua Book Company in 1960.<ref name=li/>

In 1960 he moved back to Beijing to work for Zhonghua Book Company, where he edited the ''[[Book of Jin]]'', and began working on ''Chunqiu Zuozhuan Zhu'' (Annotated Zuo Zhuan).<ref name=li/> ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' was the most monumental work of the [[Thirteen Classics]], comprising almost 200,000 [[Chinese characters|characters]] of [[Old Chinese]]. For the annotation Yang studied many related works including the ''[[Shiji]]'', ''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]'', and ''[[Guliang Zhuan]]''. He also consulted older commentaries and notes on the ''Zuo Zhuan'' by scholars such as [[Hong Liangji]], [[Liu Wenqi]] ([[:zh:<U+5289><U+6587><U+6DC7>|<U+5289><U+6587><U+6DC7>]]), [[Liu Shipei]] ([[:zh:<U+5289><U+5E2B><U+57F9>|<U+5289><U+5E2B><U+57F9>]]), and [[Zhang Binglin]], as well as [[oracle bone]] records and [[bronze inscriptions]].<ref name=yang/> Many of his notes were destroyed during the turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966<U+2013>76), which he only partially recovered from memory.<ref name=yang/> The book was finally published in 1981, more than 20 years after he started the work. A revised edition was published in 1990.<ref name=li/> In 1985, the ''Zuo Zhuan Dictionary'', compiled by Yang and his wife Xu Ti (<U+5F90><U+63D0>), was published.<ref name=li/>
