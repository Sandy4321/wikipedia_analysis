==Controversies==
In September 2009, several thousand fish were killed in Dunkard Creek,
Monongalia County, West Virginia.
After an investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency found that mining discharges from Consol Energy<U+2019>s Blacksville No. 2 mine created the conditions for a golden algae bloom, killing the fish.<ref>http://www.wvpubcast.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=14504</ref>

At the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 4, 2010, CONSOL Energy CEO, J. Brett Harvey, announced that CONSOL Energy is planning to develop mine water resources, stating, "I'd love to be in the position where I am selling water to all our competitors." With CNX and CXG's planned drilling expansion in Marcellus Shale, the use, treatment and disposal of water used in the drilling process is generating more controversy.<ref>http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_679530.html</ref>

Pennsylvania DEP and Environmentalists are charging that extremely salty well wastewater pollution in creeks and soil are the outcome of Marcellus Shale drilling and that, without state and federal regulation, the Dunkard Creek fish kill will be considered minor in comparison to the widespread environmental destruction on the horizon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10124/1055350-113.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Red flags raised over gas wells | first=Don | last=Hopey | date=May 4, 2010}}</ref>

On March 19, 2009, William Bruno, a retired 30-year veteran of CONSOL energy,<ref>http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=66439&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=534175&highlight=%20</ref> released his book,<ref>http://www.thekingrat.com/bio.html</ref> "The King Rat and His Court; Lessons  in Corporate Greed.". Although the book does not specifically name a company or people, controversy has arisen due to the fact that Mr. Bruno credits his 30 years of experience working in corporate offices and boardrooms in his author bio.

== Political involvement ==
CONSOL Energy provided the [[National Rifle Association]] access to its Blacksville No. 2 coal mine in West Virginia to film a television advertisement with an anti-[[Barack Obama]] message.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-09-22-589613148_x.htm?loc=interstitialskipcse | work=USA Today | title=UMW plans stoppage over NRA filming | date=2008-09-22 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref> The National Rifle Association intended to ask miners the question "How do you feel about having your [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights taken away if Obama becomes president." Word spread among pro-Obama miners who contacted their union, the [[United Mine Workers of America]], resulting in 440 miners taking the day off in a contract-sanctioned protest, and halted production at CONSOL's Blacksville No. 2 coal mine.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/mine-workers-protest-anti-obama-ad/?scp=1&sq=Obama%20campaign&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Mine Workers Protest Anti-Obama Ad | first=Steven | last=Greenhouse | date=2008-10-02 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}</ref>

Stephen G. Young, a vice president at CONSOL, gave $2,000 to Sen. [[Robert Byrd]].<ref>http://www.ohvec.org/newsletters/woc_2005_12/article_17.html</ref>

===Lobbying===
CONSOL Energy is second only to Peabody Energy in the amount of contributions to lobbying in 2010.<ref>http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=E1210</ref>. In the first quarter of 2010, Consol has spent $1.02 million dollars influencing the U.S. House of Representatives and Congress,<ref>http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=E5F56F17-7DA1-4873-8CAA-741502A3CF8B</ref> on issues relating to the coal mining industry. In 2009, total spending for lobbying by Consol exceeded $3 million,<ref>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?lname=CONSOL+Energy&year=2009</ref> and in 2008 CONSOL Energy contributed more $4.0 million to lobbying.<ref>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/induscode.php?year=2008&lname=E1210&id=</ref> Prior to 2008, Consol Energy's spending for lobbying activity was $0 <U+2013> $90,000 annually.<ref>http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/firmsum.php?year=2007&lname=CONSOL+Energy&id=</ref>

Significant portions of lobbying funds from CONSOL Energy have been directed against the "Employee Free Choice Act,<ref>http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=3F643A36-D0F6-49EE-B9BD-9F8AB7F2EF20</ref>" which some labor groups use to claim CONSOL is "Anti-Union." <ref>http://www.aflcio.org/joinaunion/voiceatwork/efca/efca_profile_heco.cfm</ref>

==Naming rights==
CONSOL Energy  has put its name to two sports facilities in its Pittsburgh-area home:
*[[CONSOL Energy Park]], home of the [[Washington Wild Things]] minor league baseball team near [[Washington, Pennsylvania]] near Pittsburgh.
