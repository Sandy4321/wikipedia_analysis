'''Giorgio Giulio Clovio''' or '''Juraj Julije Klovi<U+0107>''' (1498 <U+2013> January 5, 1578) was an illuminator, miniaturist, and painter born in [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]], who was mostly active in [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance Italy]].<ref>John Van Antwerp Fine, When ethnicity did not matter in the Balkans: a study of identity in pre-nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the medieval and early-modern periods, University of Michigan Press, 2006, p 195 [http://books.google.com/books?id=wEF5oN5erE0C&lpg=PA195 Google Books]</ref> He is considered the greatest illuminator of the [[Italian Renaissance|Italian High Renaissance]], and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the [[illuminated manuscript]], before some modern revivals.

==Biography==
Giulio Clovio was born in [[Gri<U+017E>ane]], a village near the town of [[Modru<U+0161>]] in [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]] (today's [[Croatia]]).<ref name="ReferenceA">The Life and Works of Giorgio Giulio Clovio, Miniaturist: with notices of his contemporaries, and of the art of decoration in the Sixteenth Century - by John William Bradley <U+2013> 1891</ref>
He came from a [[Croats|Croatian]] family.<ref name="John W. Bradley 368-369">[[#Bradley|Bradley, 2004 (reprint)]], pp. 368<U+2013>369</ref><ref name="Maria Cionini Visani 8">{{cite book | last=Visani | first=Maria | page=8 | title= Giorgio Clovio | publisher=Laurana | location= | year=1993 | isbn=}}</ref>

It is not known where he had his early training, but he may have studied art with monks at Fiume of Novi Bazar when he was young.<ref>Ralph N James , Painters and Their Works: A Dictionary of Great Artists who are Not Now Alive - 1896 - p. 201-3</ref> 

[[Image:Farnese hours. M.69.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Clovio's patron, [[Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]], from the Farnese Hours]] 
He moved to Italy at age 18 and entered the household of Cardinal [[Marino Grimani]] where he was trained as a painter. Between 1516 and ca 1523 Clovio may have lived with Marino in the residence of the latter<U+2019>s uncle Cardinal [[Domenico Grimani]] in [[Rome]].<ref name="Calvillo">Elena Calvillo,  Romanit<U+00E0> and Grazia: Giulio Clovio's Pauline Frontispieces for Marino Grimani,  The Art Bulletin, Vol. 82, No. 2 (Jun., 2000), pp. 280-297, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3051377 . JSTOR]</ref> Clovio studied under [[Giulio Romano]] during this early period.<ref>Julius Schlosser, Two Portrait Miniatures from Castle Ambras, The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 41, No. 235 (Oct., 1922), pp. 194-195+197-198, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/861625 JSTOR]</ref>

He also studied under [[Girolamo dai Libri]].

While a prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of Cardinal [[Domenico Grimani]] Clovio engraved medals and seals for him, as well as the Grimani Commentary Ms., an important early illuminated book (now [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London). 

By 1524 Clovio was at [[Budapest|Buda]], at the Hungarian court of [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|King Louis II]], for whom he painted the "Judgment of Paris" and "Lucretia". After Louis' death in the [[Battle of Moh<U+00E1>cs]], Clovio travelled to Rome where he continued his career.<ref name="Carney">Renaissance and Reformation, 1500-1620: A Biographical Dictionary (The Great Cultural Eras of the Western World) by Jo Eldridge Carney (editor) Greenwood Press 2001. Clovio Giulio p. 88-89</ref>

After 1527 he visited several monasteries of the [[Canons Regular of St. Augustine]]. In 1534 Clovio returned to the household of Cardinal Marino Grimani.<ref name="Carney"/> A year later Clovio may have followed Marino when the latter was appointed as a papal legate to [[Perugia]], where Clovio is thought to have worked on illustrations for the [[Soane Museum|Soane]] Manuscript written by Marino Grimani around that time. Clovio likely returned to Rome by the end of 1538 when he is known to have met with the writer [[Francisco de Hollanda]].<ref name="Calvillo"/>

Clovio later became a member of the household of [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]] with whom he would be associated until his death. It was during his time with Farnese that Clovio created one of his masterpieces, the [[Farnese Hours]]. Other well-known works from this period include the illustrations for the Towneley Lectionary.<ref>Lilian Armstrong, Review of The Towneley Lectionary Illuminated for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese by Giulio Clovio: The New York Public Library Astor, Lenox and Tilden Foundations Manuscript 91.

From 1551 to 1553 Clovio is known to have worked in [[Florence]]. During this time he painted a miniature of  [[Eleanor of Toledo]] (England, Walbeck Abbey, Private Collection).<ref>Janet Cox-Rearick and Mary Westerman Bulgarella, Public and Private Portraits of Cosimo de' Medici and Eleonora di Toledo: Bronzino's Paintings of His Ducal Patrons in Ottawa and Turin, Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 25, No. 49 (2004), pp. 101-159, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1483750 JSTOR]</ref>

==Contact with other artists==
Clovio was a friend of the much younger [[El Greco]], the celebrated [[Greece|Greek]] artist from [[Crete]], who later worked in [[Spain]], during El Greco's early years in Rome. Greco painted two portraits of Clovio; one shows the four painters whom he considered as his masters; in this Clovio is side by side with [[Michelangelo]], [[Titian]] and [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]]. Clovio was also known as ''Michelangelo of the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]''. Books with his miniatures became famous primarily due to his skilled illustrations. He was persuasive in transferring the style of Italian high [[Renaissance]] painting into the miniature format. {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was a personal friend of Giulio Clovio,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and stayed with Clovio in Rome during his Italian trip of 1553.<ref>Charles de Tolnay, Newly Discovered Miniatures by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 107, No. 744 (Mar., 1965), pp. 110-115</ref> Breugel executed a small medallion depicting ships in a storm on a Clovio miniature of the [[Last Judgment]] ([[New York Public Library]]),<ref>Claude Henri Rocquet, Bruegel, or, The workshop of dreams, University of Chicago Press, 1991, p 51</ref> but the six Bruegels in mentioned in Clovio's will have all disappeared.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Major works==
[[Image:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|320px|''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] Adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''Farnese Hours'']]

===''Soane Manuscript''===
Clovio illuminated the Commentary of [[Marino Grimani]] on [[St Paul]]<U+2019>s [[Epistle to the Romans]]. This work is now in the [[Sir John Soane Museum]] in London. The commentary consists of 130 vellums. Two large miniatures are included, as well as richly decorated borders. The miniatures depict the conversion of St Paul.<ref>[[#Bradley|Bradley, 2004 (reprint)]], pp. 245-253</ref>

===''Farnese Hours''===
His most famous work is the ''[[Farnese Hours]],'' completed in 1546 for [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Alessandro Farnese]], which was nine years in the making (now [[Morgan Library]], New York). He is pointing to this work in the El Greco portrait (above). This contains twenty-eight miniatures, mostly of Old and New Testament scenes, but with a famous double-page picture representing the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] procession in Rome. It has splendid silver-gilt covers, although they are not by [[Benvenuto Cellini]], as Vasari claimed.

===''Towneley Lectionary''===
The ''Towneley [[Lectionary]]'' is now in the [[New York Public Library]] and probably belonged to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Used during services, the book contained six majestic, full-page miniatures opposite miniature depictions of the Evangelists. The illustrations, introduced the relevant readings from the Scripture. They include the Nativity,  the [[Resurrection]] and the [[Last Judgment]].<ref>[[#Bradley|Bradley, 2004 (reprint)]], pp. 254-260</ref>

===''Colonna Missal''===
[[Image:Giulio Clovio 001.jpg|left|thumb|220px|An illuminated page from his ''Colonna missal', [[John Rylands Library]], Manchester.]]
This work dates to c. 1512 and is now in the John Rylands University Library in Manchester.<ref>Donato Mansueto, The Italian emblem: a collection of essays, Librairie Droz, 2007,  p 182, n. 56</ref> The Colonna Missal was made for Cardinal Pompeo Colonna. There had been some debate about the identity of the artist. Some had attributed the missal to Raphael (about 1517). It has also been suggested that the work may belong to Vinzenzio Raimondi.<ref>The John Rylands library, Manchester: a brief record of twenty-one years' work (MCM January MCMXII), The University press, 1921, pg xiv [http://books.google.com/books?id=og5HAAAAIAAJ&dq=colonna%20rylands%20clovio&pg=PR14#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]</ref> It is now generally attributed to Clovio.<ref>Baltrusaitis, J., En busca de Isis, Siruela , 2006, 9788478444601, [http://books.google.com/books?id=i8cdHmcLYxEC URL]</ref><ref>John Rylands Library and Guppy, H., Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, v. 6, Manchester University Press, 1922, [http://books.google.com/books?id=8g8DAAAAYAAJ URL]</ref>

===Other===
The [[British Library]] has his twelve miniatures of the victories of the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], and other works. The [[Vatican library]] has a manuscript life of Frederigo III di Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, superbly illustrated by Clovio.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Other illustrations by him are kept in libraries in [[Vienna]], [[New York]], [[Munich]], and [[Paris]], and other works are in many private collections. A large exhibition of his works was held in 2012 in ''[[Klovi<U+0107>evi Dvori]]'' ("Palace of Klovi<U+0107>"), the art gallery dedicated to him in [[Zagreb]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.galerijaklovic.hr/sites/default/files/katalog_pdf/katalog.pdf | title=Julije Klovi<U+0107> <U+2013> najve<U+0107>i minijaturist renesanse | trans_title=Giulio Clovio   <U+2013>   the greatest miniaturist of the Renaissance | language=Croatian and English | last=Pokle<U+010D>ki-Sto<U+0161>i<U+0107>, Jasminka | format=PDF | accessdate=2013-08-02}}</ref>

According to a description written for publication by Antonfrancesco Cirni, he also designed many of the costumes for the famously elaborate wedding festivities of Ortensia [[Borromeo]] in March 1565, which were held in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] and included a tournament in the Belvedere courtyard. Such duties were often expected of a Renaissance court painter. The costumes are carefully recorded in a series of anonymous [[etching]]s, some probably based on Clovio's design drawings. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Death and burial==
Giulio Clovio died in Rome on January 5, 1578. His tomb is in the [[San Pietro in Vincoli|Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli]], the church containing [[Michelangelo]]'s celebrated ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''.

==500th anniversary==
Croatia celebrated the 500th anniversary of his birth in 1998. The [[Croatian National Bank]] issued a special 200 [[kuna (currency)|kuna]] silver coin in commemoration. A monument to Clovio was also raised in Drivenik. The [[Government of Croatia|Croatian government]] recently made news by purchasing Clovio's ''The Last Judgement'', a painting Clovio gave as a gift to [[Pope Clement VII]]. Bernardin Modri<U+0107> released his film ''The Gospel According to Klovi<U+0107>'' in 2006. The Vatican celebrated this anniversary with postal stamps.

==Legacy==

Today, Giulio Clovio is celebrated in [[Italy]] and [[Croatia]]. He was born in the Kingdom of Croatia, and stated his [[Croats|Croatian]] identity.<ref name="John W. Bradley 368-369"/><ref name="Maria Cionini Visani 8"/> But, for most of his life he worked in Italy, and is therefore often referred to as [[Italian people|Italian]] painter.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/122438/Giulio-Clovio "Giulio Clovio."
