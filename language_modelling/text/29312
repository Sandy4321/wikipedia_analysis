'''Cardiff''' ({{lang-en|{{Audio|Cardiff.ogg|Cardiff}}}} {{IPAEng|'k<U+0251><U+02D0>d<U+026A>f}}, {{lang-cy|{{Audio-nohelp|Caerdydd.ogg|''Caerdydd''}}}}) is the [[capital]] and the largest [[Unitary authority#Wales|city and county]] in [[Wales]]. As well as being the political capital, it is Wales's centre for business, education, sport, tourism, culture, media and government. According to recent local government estimates, the population of the [[unitary authority area]] is 317,500.<ref name="census">{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?Parent_Directory_id=2865&nav=2872,3256,3302| title=Cardiff Council 2006 Official Estimate | accessdate=2007-12-14}}</ref>  

The city of Cardiff is the [[county town]] of the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]] (later [[South Glamorgan]]). Cardiff is part of the [[Eurocities]] network of the largest [[Europe]]an cities.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eurocities.org/ | title=Eurocities | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> [[Cardiff Urban Area]] covers a slightly larger area, including [[Dinas Powys]], [[Penarth]] and [[Radyr]]. It was a small town until the early 19th century and came to prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region. Cardiff was made a [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] in 1905, and proclaimed [[capital of Wales]] in 1955.  Since the 1990s Cardiff has seen significant development with a new waterfront area at [[Cardiff Bay]] which contains the new [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh Assembly]] Building, and the [[Cardiff city centre|city centre]] is currently undergoing a major redevelopment. International sporting venues in the city include the [[Millennium Stadium]] ([[rugby union]] and [[Association football|football]]) and [[SWALEC Stadium]] ([[cricket]]).  Cardiff is a significant tourist centre with 11.7&nbsp;million visitors in 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=9200 | title=Steam report | accessdate=2008-05-31}}</ref>

Cardiff is home to the biggest media sector in the [[United Kingdom]] outside [[London]], being home to a number of television studios and radio stations, such as the [[BBC]], [[ITV]], [[HTV]], [[S4C]] as well as independent broadcasters. <ref name="media">{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3775 | title=The Film, TV and Multimedia Sector in Cardiff | publisher=Economic Development Division, Cardiff County Council | format=PDF | date=2003-12-01 | accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>

== History ==
{{main|History of Cardiff|Timeline of Cardiff history}}
=== Origins of the name ===
[[Image:Cardiff Castle (Roman wall).jpg|thumb|left|The front wall of [[Cardiff Castle]], showing part of the original Roman fort from which the city may have derived its name]]
The name Cardiff and its [[Welsh language|Welsh]] equivalent ''Caerdydd'' are both believed by most modern experts to derive from post-Roman [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] words meaning "the fort on the [[River Taff|Taff]]".  "Dydd" or "Diff" are both modifications of "[[River Taff|Taff]]", the river on which [[Cardiff Castle]] stands, with the ''T'' [[lenition|mutating]] to ''D'' in Welsh.  According to a leading modern authority<ref>[http://placenames.bangor.ac.uk//English/html/hywel_wyn_owen.html Prof. Hywel Wyn Owen, University of Wales]</ref> on [[toponymy]], the Welsh pronunciation of "Caerdyff" as "Caerdydd" shows the colloquial alternation of Welsh ''"-f"'' and ''"-dd"''.<ref name=hwo>Hywel Wyn Owen, ''The Place-names of Wales'', 1998, ISBN 0-7083-1458-9</ref>

In the past, antiquarians such as [[William Camden]] suggested that the name Cardiff might derive from a name "Caer-Didi" ("the Fort of Didius") given in honour of [[Aulus Didius Gallus]], governor of a nearby province at the time when the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] established a fort at Cardiff.  Although some modern websites repeat this theory as fact, it is refuted by modern scholars on linguistic grounds, with Professor Gwynedd Pierce of [[Cardiff University]] recently describing it as ''"rubbish"''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/videoexplorer/pages/?jumpTo=cardiff |title=What's In A Name? - Cardiff |last=Pierce | first=Prof Gwynedd O. | publisher=BBC Wales | accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref>

=== Roman period to the Middle Ages ===
The history of what is now Cardiff began with a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort on the site, built in 75 CE.<ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699">{{cite web |url= http://www.angelfire.com/ga/BobSanders/CDFF1.html |publisher=Bob Sanders |title=A Cardiff & Vale of Glamorgan Chronology up to 1699 |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> As Roman rule in [[Britannia]] ended near the start of the 5th century the fort was abandoned. <ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699" />
[[Image:John Speed's map of Cardiff 1610.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Speed]]'s map of Cardiff from 1610]]
In 1091 [[Robert Fitzhamon]] began work on the castle keep within the walls of the old Roman fort. [[Cardiff Castle]] has been at the heart of the city ever since. <ref name="Cardiff Visitors">{{cite web |url= http://www.visitcardiff.com/About-Cardiff/Cardiff-History.html |publisher=Visit Cardiff |title= Cardiff history|accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> The castle was substantially altered and extended during the Victorian period by [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]], and the [[architect]] [[William Burges (architect)|William Burges]]. Original Roman work can, however, still be distinguished in the wall facings. 

Soon a little town grew up in the shadow of the castle, made up primarily of settlers from England.<ref name="Cardiffians">{{cite web |url= http://www.cardiffians.co.uk/timeline.html |publisher= Cardiffians |title=Cardiff Timeline |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> Cardiff had a population of between 1,500 and 2,000 in the Middle Ages, a relatively normal size for a Welsh town in this period.<ref name="Tim Lambert-short history of Cardiff">{{cite web |url= http://www.localhistories.org/Cardiff.html |publisher=Tim Lambert |title=A SHORT HISTORY OF CARDIFF |accessdate=2008-02-29}}</ref> By the end of the 13th century, Cardiff was the only town in Wales with a population exceeding 2,000, but it was relatively small compared to most other notable towns in the [[Kingdom of England]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.helsinki.fi/iehc2006/papers3/Campbell122.pdf | title=Benchmarking medieval economic development: England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, circa 1290 | first=Bruce M S | last=Campbell | date=2006-08-25 | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>
[[Image:Cardiff-Castle.jpg|left|thumb|300px|View of Caerdiffe (Cardiff) Castle]]
Cardiff was a busy port in the Middle Ages, in 1327, it was declared a [[Staple port]]<ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699" />. In the early 12th century a wooden palisade was erected around the city to protect it. 

In 1404 [[Owain Glyndwr]] burned Cardiff and took Cardiff Castle.<ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699" /> As the town was still very small, most of the buildings were made of wood and the town was reduced to ashes. However, the town was rebuilt not long after and began to flourish once again.<ref name="Tim Lambert-short history of Cardiff" />

=== County town of Glamorganshire ===
In 1536, the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535<U+2013>1542|Act of Union]] between England and Wales led to the creation of the [[shire]] of Glamorgan. Cardiff was made the [[county town]]. Around this same time the Herbert family became the most powerful family in the area.<ref name="Cardiffians" /> In 1538, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] closed the [[Dominican]] and [[Franciscan]] friaries in Cardiff, the remains of which were used as building materials. <ref name="Tim Lambert-short history of Cardiff" /> A writer around this period described Cardiff: "The River Taff runs under the walls of his honours castle and from the north part of the town to the south part where there is a fair quay and a safe harbour for shipping." <ref name="Tim Lambert-short history of Cardiff" />

Cardiff had become a Free Borough in 1542.<ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699" /> In 1573, it was made a head port for collection of customs duties. In 1581, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted Cardiff its first [[royal charter]]<ref name="Cardiffians" />. By 1602 [[Pembrokeshire]] historian [[George Owen of Henllys|George Owen]] described Cardiff as "the fayrest towne in Wales yett not the welthiest. <ref name="Cardiffians" /> The town gained a second [[Royal Charter]] in 1608.<ref name="GoogoBits">{{cite web |url= http://www.googobits.com/articles/2181-a-history-lovers-guide-to-cardiff.html|publisher=GoogoBits.com |title= A History Lovers Guide to Cardiff|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> During the [[Second English Civil War]], [[St. Fagans]] just to the west of the town, played host to the [[Battle of St. Fagans]]. The battle, between a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] rebellion and a [[New Model Army]] detachment, was a decisive victory for the [[Parliamentarians]] and allowed [[Oliver Cromwell]] to conquer Wales.<ref name="Bob Sanders-period up to 1699" /> It is the last major battle to occur in Wales, with a total death toll of about 200 (mostly Royalist) soldiers killed. <ref name="Cardiffians" />

In the ensuing century Cardiff was at peace. In 1766, [[John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute]] married into the Herbert family and was later created [[Baron Cardiff]].<ref name="Cardiffians" /> In 1778, he began renovations on Cardiff Castle.<ref name="Bob Sanders 2">{{cite web |url= http://www.angelfire.com/ga/BobSanders/CDFF2.html |publisher=Bob Sanders |title=A Cardiff & Vale of Glamorgan Chronology 1700 - 1849 |accessdate=2008-03-04}}</ref> In the 1790s a [[racecourse]], [[printing press]], [[bank]] and [[coffee room]] all opened, and Cardiff gained a [[stagecoach]] service to London. Despite these improvements, Cardiff's position in the Welsh [[urban hierarchy]] had declined over the 18th century. [[Iolo Morgannwg]] called it "an obscure and inconsiderable place", and the [[Census Act 1800|1801 census]] found the population to be only 1,870, making Cardiff only the twenty-fifth largest town in Wales, well behind [[Merthyr]] and [[Swansea]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref>

=== Building of the docks ===
In 1793, [[John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute]] was born. He would spend his life building the Cardiff docks and would later be called "the creator of modern Cardiff".<ref name="Cardiffians" /> In 1815, a twice-weekly boat service between Cardiff and [[Bristol]] was established.<ref name="Bob Sanders 2" /> In 1821, the Cardiff Gas Works was established.<ref name="Bob Sanders 2" />

The town grew rapidly from the 1830s onwards, when the [[Marquess of Bute]] built a [[dock (maritime)|dock]] which eventually linked to the [[Taff Vale Railway]]. Cardiff became the main port for exports of coal from the [[Cynon Valley|Cynon]], [[Rhondda]], and [[Rhymney Valley|Rhymney]] valleys, and grew at a rate of nearly 80% per decade between 1840 and 1870. Much of the growth was due to [[migration]] from within and outside Wales: in 1851, a quarter of Cardiff's population were English-born and more than 10% had been born in Ireland. By the 1881 census, Cardiff had overtaken both Merthyr and Swansea to become the largest town in Wales. Cardiff's new status as the premier town in South Wales was confirmed when it was chosen as the site of the [[University of Wales|University College South Wales and Monmouthshire]] in 1893.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

Cardiff faced a challenge in the 1880s when [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies of Llandinam]] and the [[Barry Railway Company]] promoted the development of rival docks at [[Barry]]. Barry docks had the advantage of being accessible in all [[tide]]s, and David Davies claimed that his venture would cause "grass to grow in the streets of Cardiff". From 1901 coal exports from Barry surpassed those from Cardiff, but the administration of the coal trade remained centred on Cardiff, in particular its [[Coal Exchange]], where the price of coal on the British market was determined and the first million-pound deal was struck in 1907.<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> The city also strengthened its industrial base with the decision of [[GKN|Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]], owners of the [[Dowlais Ironworks]] in Merthyr, to build a new [[steel mill|steelworks]] close to the docks at East Moors in 1890.

=== City and capital city status ===
[[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted Cardiff [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] on [[28 October]] [[1905]], and the city acquired a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cathedral]] in 1916. In subsequent years an increasing number of national institutions were located in the city, including the [[National Museum Cardiff|National Museum of Wales]], Welsh national [[war memorial]], and the [[University of Wales]] registry - although it was denied the [[National Library of Wales]], partly because the library's founder, Sir John Williams, considered Cardiff to have "a non-Welsh population".<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/>

After a brief post-war boom, Cardiff docks entered a prolonged decline in the [[interwar period]]. By 1936, their trade was less than half its value in 1913, reflecting the slump in demand for [[South Wales coalfield|Welsh coal]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of Wales"/> Bomb damage during the [[Cardiff Blitz]] in [[World War II]] included the devastation of [[Llandaff Cathedral]], and in the immediate postwar years the city's link with the Bute family came to an end.

The city was proclaimed [[capital]] city of Wales on [[20 December]] [[1955]], by a written reply by the [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. [[Caernarfon]] had also vied for this title.<ref>{{cite news | title=Cardiff as Capital of Wales: Formal Recognition by Government | publisher=The Times | date=1955-12-21}}</ref> Cardiff therefore celebrated two important [[anniversary|anniversaries]] in 2005. The Encyclopedia of Wales notes that the decision to recognise the city as the capital of Wales "had more to do with the fact that it contained marginal [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] constituencies than any reasoned view of what functions a Welsh capital should have". Although the city hosted the [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1958, Cardiff only became a centre of national administration with the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]] in 1964, which later prompted the creation of various other public bodies such as the [[Arts Council of Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]], most of which were based in Cardiff.

The East Moors Steelworks closed in 1978 and Cardiff lost population during the 1980s,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10150530&c_id=10001043&add=N | title=Cardiff Wales Through Time - Population Statistics | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> consistent with a wider pattern of [[counter urbanisation]] in Britain. However, it recovered and was one of the few cities (outside [[London]]) where population grew during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/cbcb/census1.pdf | title=The Growth and Decline of Cities and Regions | date=2004-07-01 | accessdate-2008-05-20}}</ref> During this period the [[Cardiff Bay Development Corporation]] was promoting the [[Urban renewal|redevelopment]] of south Cardiff; an evaluation of the regeneration of Cardiff Bay published in 2004 concluded that the project had "reinforced the competitive position of Cardiff" and "contributed to a massive improvement in the quality of the built environment", although it had failed "to attract the major inward investors originally anticipated".<ref>Esys Consulting Ltd, Evaluation of Regeneration in Cardiff Bay. A report for the Welsh Assembly Government, December 2004</ref>

In the 1999 [[devolution]] [[referendum]], Cardiff voters rejected the establishment of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] by 55.4% to 44.2% on a 47% turnout, which Denis Balsom partly ascribed to a general preference in Cardiff and some other parts of Wales for a [[British people|'British']] rather than exclusively [[Welsh people|'Welsh']] [[national identity|identity]].<ref>Balsom, Denis. 'The referendum result'. In Jones, James Barry; Balsom, Denis (ed.), ''The road to the National Assembly for Wales''.

The city was [[county town]] of [[Glamorgan]] until the council reorganisation in 1974 paired Cardiff and the now [[Vale of Glamorgan]] together as the new county of [[South Glamorgan]]. Further local government restructuring in 1996 resulted in Cardiff city's [[Districts of Wales|district]] council becoming a [[unitary authority]], the [[City and County of Cardiff]], with the addition of [[Creigiau]] and [[Pentyrch]].

== Governance ==
=== Local government ===
[[Image:Cardiff City Hall wide view.jpg|thumb|Cardiff's [[City Hall, Cardiff|City Hall]]]]
{{main|Cardiff Council}}
Since local government reorganisation in 1996, Cardiff has been governed by [[Cardiff Council|The City and County Council of Cardiff]], which is based at [[County Hall, Cardiff|County Hall]] in Atlantic Wharf, Cardiff Bay. Voters elect 75 councillors every four years, with the next elections due to be held in 2012.

Since the 2004 local elections, no individual political party has held a majority on Cardiff County Council. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have 35 councillors, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] have 17, [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] have 13, [[Plaid Cymru]] have 7 and three councillors sit as Independents. The Leader of the Council, Cllr [[Rodney Berman]], is from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].<br />The Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru have formed a partnership administration to run the council.

=== National Assembly for Wales ===
{{main|National Assembly for Wales}}
[[Image:Senedd.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Senedd]] building.]]
The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has been based in [[Cardiff Bay]] since its formation in 1999. The building which is now known as the ''[[Senedd]]'' (Welsh for Legislature, Parliament or Senate) was opened on [[1 March]] [[2006]], by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]]. The executive and civil servants of the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] are based in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] while the Assembly Members, the Assembly Parliamentary Service and Ministerial support staff are based in Cardiff Bay. Cardiff elects four constituency Assembly Members (AMs) to the Assembly, with the individual constituencies for the Assembly being the same as for the UK Parliament. All of the city's residents have an extra vote for the [[South Wales Central]] region which increases proportionality to the Assembly. The most recent Welsh Assembly [[elections]] were held on [[3 May]] [[2007]].

=== Political representation ===
Cardiff is presently split into four parliamentary constituencies which form the electoral basis for elections to the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]].

The constituencies and their representatives are:
* [[Cardiff Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff Central]]: MP [[Jenny Willott]], AM [[Jenny Randerson]] (Both Liberal Democrat)
* [[Cardiff North]]: MP [[Julie Morgan]] (Labour), AM [[Jonathan Morgan (Welsh politician)|Jonathan Morgan]] (Conservative)
* [[Cardiff South and Penarth]]: MP [[Alun Michael]], AM [[Lorraine Barrett]] (Both Labour)
* [[Cardiff West]]: MP [[Kevin Brennan (politician)|Kevin Brennan]], AM [[Rhodri Morgan]] (Both Labour)

The [[South Wales Central|South Wales Central Assembly Region]] elects four Assembly Members to serve the area covered by Cardiff, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff|Rhondda-Cynon-Taf]] and the [[Vale of glamorgan|Vale of Glamorgan]] local authority areas. These are currently:
* [[David Melding]] (Conservative)
* [[Andrew R. T. Davies]] (Conservative)
* [[Leanne Wood]] (Plaid Cymru)
* [[Christopher Franks]] (Plaid Cymru)

Famous politicians who have represented Cardiff constituencies include:
* [[Lord Callaghan]]
* [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy]]

Cardiff is part of the Wales constituency in [[European Parliament]] elections - the current [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPS]] are [[Glenys Kinnock]], Labour and [[Jill Evans]], Plaid Cymru, who have represented the constituency since 1999.

== Geography ==
Cardiff is a relatively flat city bounded by hills on the outskirts to the east, north and west. Its geographic features were influential in its development as the world's largest coal port,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiffbay.co.uk | title=Cardiff Bay Official Website | accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref> most notably its proximity and easy access to the coal fields of the south Wales valleys. 

[[Image:Cardiff from space.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of Cardiff, showing vegetation and land cover.  [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] is shown bottom left]]

Cardiff is built on reclaimed marshland on a bed of [[Triassic]] stones; this reclaimed marshland stretches from [[Chepstow]] to the Ely Estuary, which is the natural boundary of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan. {{Fact|date=July 2008}} Triassic landscapes are usually shallow and low-lying which accounts and explains Cardiff's flatness. {{Fact|date=July 2008}} The classic Triassic [[marl]], [[sand]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks are used predominantly throughout Cardiff as building materials. Many of these Triassic rocks have a purple complexion, especially the coastal [[marl]] found near Penarth. One of the Triassic rocks used in Cardiff is "Radyr Stone", a [[freestone]] which as it name suggests is quarried in the Radyr district. Cardiff has also imported some materials for buildings: [[Devonian]] sandstones (the [[Old Red Sandstone]]) from the [[Brecon Beacons]] has been used. Most famously, the buildings of [[Cathays Park]], the civic centre in the centre of the city, are built of [[Portland stone]] which was imported from Dorset. A widely used building stone in Cardiff is the surreal yellow-grey [[Early Jurassic|Liassic]] [[limestone]] rock of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], including the very rare "Sutton Stone", a conglomerate of lias limestone and [[carboniferous]] limestone that is, apart from Radyr Stone, the only free-stone in south-east Wales (freestones can be cut to a perfectly smooth surface). 

Cardiff is bordered to the west by the rural district of the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], which is also known as The Garden of Cardiff,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gardenofcardiff.com/ | title=The Garden of Cardiff | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> to the east by the city of [[Newport]], to the north by the [[South Wales Valleys]] and to the south by the [[River Severn|Severn Estuary]] and [[Bristol Channel]]. The [[River Taff]] winds through the centre of the city and together with the [[River Ely]] flows into the freshwater lake of [[Cardiff Bay]]. A third river, the [[River Rhymney|Rhymney]] flows through the east of the city entering directly into the Severn Estuary.

Cardiff is situated near the [[Glamorgan]] [[Heritage Coast]], stretching westward from Penarth and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] (which are commuter towns of Cardiff), with its striped yellow-blue Jurassic "lias" limestone cliffs that thrust outwards towards the Bristol Channel. The Glamorgan coast is the only part of the [[Celtic Sea]] that has exposed [[Jurassic]] ([[blue lias]]) geology. This west facing stretch of coast, which takes the brunt of brutal Atlantic westerlies and has reefs, sandbanks and serrated cliffs aplenty (like [[Cornwall]]) was a ship graveyard during the age of sail; ships sailing up to Cardiff during the industrial era often never made it as far as Cardiff as most were wrecked around this hostile coastline during brutal west/south-westerly gales. Consequently, just like its Celtic cousin in Cornwall, smuggling, deliberate shipwrecking and attacks on ships became a way of life for many people living in the small coastal villages of the Vale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenfig.org.uk/smuggling.html|title=Smuggling Around Kenfig|publisher=Kenfig.org|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref>

Roughly speaking, "Inner Cardiff" can be considered to consist of the following wards: [[Penylan]], [[Plasnewydd]], [[Gabalfa]], [[Roath]], [[Cathays (electoral ward)|Cathays]], [[Adamsdown]] and [[Splott (electoral ward)|Splott]] ward on the north and east of the city centre, and [[Butetown]], [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]], [[Riverside, Cardiff|Riverside]] and [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] to the south and west. The inner-city areas to the south of the [[A4161 road]] known as the "Southern Arc" are, with the exception of affluent and trendy Cardiff Bay, some of the poorest districts of Wales with low levels of economic activity and high ethnic minority populations. On the other hand Gabalfa, Plasnewydd and Cathays north of the 'arc' have very large student populations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/prospective/pg/life/accommodation/areasofcardiff/index.html|title=Areas of Cardiff|publisher=Cardiff University|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> and Pontcanna north of Riverside and alongside Canton is a favourite for young professionals and media types. [[Penylan]] which lies to the north east side of Roath Park is an affluent area popular with those with older children and the retired.
[[Image:Pearl Assurance Building 2007.jpg|left|thumb|[[Capital Tower, Cardiff]]]]

"Suburban Cardiff" can be broken down into three distinct areas. To the west lie [[Ely, Cardiff|Ely]], [[Caerau, Cardiff|Caerau]] and [[Fairwater, Cardiff|Fairwater]] which contain some of the largest housing estates in the United Kingdom. With the exception of some of the outlying privately built estates at Michaelston Super Ely and 1930s developments near Waun-Gron Road, this is an economically disadvantaged area with high numbers of unemployed households. [[Culverhouse Cross]] is a more affluent western area of the city. [[Radyr]], [[Llandaff]], [[Llandaff North]], [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]] & [[Tongwynlais]], [[Rhiwbina]], [[Heath, Cardiff|Heath]], [[Llanishen]], [[Lisvane]], and [[Cyncoed]] which lie in an arc from the north west to the north east of the centre can be considered the main middle class suburbs of the city. In particular, Cyncoed, [[Radyr]] and Lisvane contain some of the most expensive housing in Wales. Further to the east lie the wards of Pontprennau & Old St Mellons, Rumney, [[Pentwyn, Cardiff|Pentwyn]], [[Llanrumney]] and [[Trowbridge, Cardiff|Trowbridge]]. The latter three are again largely of public housing stock, although new private housing is being built in Trowbridge in considerable number. [[Pontprennau]] is the newest 'suburb' of Cardiff, whilst [[St Mellons|Old St Mellons]] has a history going back to the [[Norman Conquest]] in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldstmellons.co.uk/history/|title=Old St Mellons History|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

To the north west of the city lies a region that may be called "Rural Cardiff" containing the villages of [[St. Fagans]], [[Creigiau]], [[Pentyrch]], [[Tongwynlais]] and [[Gwaelod-y-garth]]. St. Fagans, home to the [[Museum of Welsh Life]], is protected from further development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=9569|title=St Fagans Conservation Area Appraisal|date=2007|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

Following a period of decline during the 1970s and 1980s, Cardiff's population is growing. The local authority area had an estimated population of more than 317,500 in 2006, compared to a [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] figure of 305,353.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=276879&c=Cardiff&d=13&e=16&g=421924&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1204063245714&enc=1&dsFamilyId=75 | title=Neighbourhood Statistics | publisher=Office for National Statistics | date=2001-04-01 | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref> According to Census 2001 data, Cardiff was the 14th [[List of largest United Kingdom settlements by population|largest settlement]] in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/census2001/ks_ua_ew_part1.pdf Key Statistics for urban areas in England and Wales], ''Census 2001'', retrieved [[2008-06-12]]</ref> and the 21st largest [[List of conurbations in the United Kingdom|urban area]].<ref>Pointer, Graham, [http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_compendia/fom2005/03_FOPM_UrbanAreas.pdf The UK<U+2019>s major urban areas], ''Focus on People and Migration'', 2005, retrieved [[2008-06-12]]</ref> 

Official estimates derived from the census regarding the city's total population have been disputed. The city council has published two articles that argue the 2001 census seriously under reports the population of Cardiff and, in particular, the ethnic minority population of some inner city areas.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3418&Language= | title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 1 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3419&Language= | title=Cardiff Council Representations to ONS on the 2001 Census: Section 2 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref> 

Cardiff has a ethnically diverse population due to its past trading connections, post-war immigration and the large numbers of foreign students who attend university in the city. The ethnic make-up of Cardiff's population at the time of the 2001 census was: 91.6% white, 2% mixed race, 4% South Asian, 1.3% Black, 1.2% Other ethnic origin. According to a report published in 2005, over 30,000 people from an ethnic minority live in Cardiff, around 8.4% of the city's total - many of these communities live in [[Butetown]], where ethnic minorities make up around a third of the total population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=4997| format=PDF|title=Black and Minority Ethnic Communities Consultation Report, 2005|date=2005-09-01|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> This diversity, and especially that of the city's long-established African and Arab communities, has been celebrated in a number of cultural exhibitions and events, along with a number of books which have been published on this subject.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Brian|title=Butetown and Cardiff Docks |publisher=The History Press|date=1999-04-15|isbn=978-0752415826 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhac.org/black_history.html|title=Black History in Butetown|publisher=Butetown History & Arts Centre|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>

{{see also|History of the Jews in Wales}}
Since 1922 Cardiff has included the suburban cathedral 'village' of [[Llandaff]], whose bishop is currently [[Archbishop of Wales]]. There is also a [[Cardiff Cathedral|Roman Catholic cathedral]] in the city.  Since 1916 Cardiff has been the seat of a [[Catholic]] archbishop, but there appears to have been a fall in the estimated [[Catholic]] population, with estimated numbers in 2006 being around 25,000 less than in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html#stats|title=Archdiocese of Cardiff - Statistics|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>. Likewise, the [[Jewish]] population of the city has also appeared to have fallen&mdash;there are currently two synagogues in Cardiff, one in Cyncoed and one in Moira Terrace, as opposed to seven at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/Community/Cardiff.htm | title=JCR-UK - Cardiff Community | date=2005-10-14 | accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> There are a significant number of [[nonconformism| nonconformist]] chapels, an early-20th century Greek Orthodox church and eleven mosques.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Roath/Chapels.html | title=Cardiff, Llandaff & Roath chapels database | accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nostos.com/church/ | title=The Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain | accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muslimdirectory.co.uk/displayresults.php?PHPSESSID=f0fb8b41d8758983e7d43cddb556b9df&businesstype=1&orgtype=&country=UK&city=Cardiff | title=Muslim Directory - Mosques in Cardiff | accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>

In the 2001 census 66.9% of the city's population described themselves as Christian, below the Welsh and UK average, while 3.7% described themselves as Muslim, significantly above the Welsh average but in line with the UK average. The proportion of people declaring themselves to be Hindu, Sikh and Jewish were all considerably higher than the Welsh averages, but less than the UK figures. 18.8% stated they had no religion, while 8.6% did not state a religion.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00PT-A.asp#ethnic | title=Census 2001 - Profiles - Cardiff - Ethnicity & Religion | date=2003-02-19 | accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>

The oldest of the non-Christian faith communities in Wales is Judaism.  Jews were not permitted to live Wales between the 1290 [[Edict of Expulsion]] and the seventeenth century. A Welsh Jewish community was re-established in the eighteenth century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_15.shtml|title="Multicultural Wales"|accessdate=2007-12-06|publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}</ref>  

Jews continue to be part of Welsh life.{{clarifyme|date=August 2008}}  The modern community is centered in the [[Cardiff United Synagogue]].

Cardiff has one of the longest-established Muslim populations in the UK, started by Yemeni sailors who settled in the city during the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ansari | first = Humayun | authorlink = Humayun Ansari | title = The Infidel Within: Muslims in Britain Since 1800 | publisher = C.

The city has been home to a sizable Hindu community since Indian immigrants settled there during the 1950s and 1960s. The first Hindu temple in the city was opened in [[Grangetown]] on [[April 6]] [[1979]] on the site of an abandoned printing press (which itself was the former site of a synagogue).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swaminarayanwales.org.uk/History/history.asp|title=History of Shree Swaminarayan Temple Cardiff|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> The 25th anniversary of the temple's founding was celebrated in September 2007 with a parade of over 3000 people through the city centre, including Hindus from across the United Kingdom and members of Cardiff's other religious communities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/7006249.stm|title=Worshippers celebrate with parade |date=2007-09-22|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2008-05-21}}</ref> Today, there are over 2000 Hindus in Cardiff, worshiping at three temples across the city.<ref name="cityprofile" />

==Economy==
{{main|Economy and industry of Cardiff}}
As the capital city of Wales, Cardiff is the main engine of growth in the Welsh economy. The economy of Cardiff and adjacent areas makes up nearly 20% of Welsh GDP and 40% of the city<U+2019>s workforce are daily in-commuters from the surrounding south Wales area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/economic_trends/Sub-regional_&_Local_Area_GDP.pdf|title=Sub-regional and local area gross domestic product|last=Clifton-Fearnside|first=Alex|coauthors=Adam Douglas|date=2002-05-14|publisher=Office of National Statistics|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statswales.wales.gov.uk/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=4903&IF_Language=isl|title=Statistics on Commuting in Wales|date=2007-12-05|publisher=Statistics for Wales|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref>
[[Image:Cardiff Barrage Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Cardiff Barrage Entrance locks]]
Industry has played a major part in Cardiff's development for many centuries. The main catalyst for its transformation from a small town into a big city was the demand for coal required in making iron and later steel, brought to the sea by [[packhorse]] from [[Merthyr Tydfil]]. This was first achieved by the construction of a {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} long canal from Merthyr (510 feet above sea-level) to the Taff Estuary at Cardiff.<ref name="canal">{{cite web|url=http://www.alangeorge.co.uk/the_glamorganshire_canal.htm|title=The Glamorganshire Canal|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> Eventually the [[Taff Vale Railway]] replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff - all prompted by the soaring world-wide demand for coal from the South Wales valleys.

At its peak, Cardiff's [[port]], known as [[Tiger Bay]], became the busiest port in the world and&mdash;for some time&mdash;the world's most important [[coal]] port. In the years leading up to the [[First World War]], more than 10 million tonnes of coal was exported annually from Cardiff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/rhagor/article/?article_id=50|title=Cardiff - Coal and Shipping Metropolis of the World|publisher=National Museum of Wales|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> In 1907, Cardiff's [[Coal Exchange]] was the first host to a business deal for a million [[Pound Sterling|pounds Sterling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glamro.gov.uk/check/Building%20of%20a%20Capital%202/A_Why.html|title=Why Did Cardiff Grow?|publisher=Glamorgan record Office|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> After a period of decline, Cardiff's port has started to grow again - over 3 million tonnes of cargo passed through through the docks in 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7414502.stm|title=Ports' resurgence as imports grow |date=2008-05-22|publisher=BBC News Wales|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref>

Today, Cardiff is the principal [[finance]] and business [[Service (economics)|services]] centre in [[Wales]], and as such there is a strong representation of finance and business services in the local economy. This sector, combined with the Public Administration, Education and Health sectors, have accounted for around 75% of Cardiff's economic growth since 1991.<ref name="employ">{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?Object_ID=3393&|title=Labour Market:An overview of Cardiff Empoyment and the local economy|date=2004-04-09|publisher=Cardiff County Council|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> The city was recently placed seventh overall in the top 50 European cities in the fDI 2008 Cities of the Future list published by the Foreign Direct Invester (FDI) magazine, and also ranked seventh in terms of attracting foreign investment.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://fdimagazine.com/cp/10/FDI_052-055_0208-2.pdf | format=PDF | title=European Cities & Regions of the Future 2008/09 | date=2008-02-01 | accessdate=2008-03-25}}</ref> Notable companies such as [[Legal & General]], [[Admiral]] Insurance, [[HBOS]], [[Zurich Financial Services|Zurich]], [[ING Direct]], [[The Automobile Association|The AA]], [[Principality Building Society]], [[118118]], [[Centrica plc|British Gas]], [[SA Brain & Company Ltd|Brains]], [[SWALEC|SWALEC Energy]] and [[BT]],  all operate large national or regional headquarters and contact centres in the city, some of them based in Cardiff's office towers such as [[Capital Tower, Cardiff|Capital Tower]] and Brunel House. Other major employers include [[NHS Wales]] and the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. On [[1 March]] [[2004]], Cardiff was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status.

=== Castles ===
[[Image:Castell Coch frontside January midday.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Castell Coch]]

Complementing Cardiff Castle is a second castle north of the city, called [[Castell Coch]] (Welsh: "Red Castle"). The current castle is an elaborately decorated Victorian folly designed by Burges for the Marquess and built in the 1870s. However, the Victorian castle stands on the footings of a much older medieval castle possibly built by [[Ifor Bach]], a regional baron with links to Cardiff Castle also. The exterior has become a popular location for film and television productions.

Situated on the narrowest part of the south Wales coastal plain, Cardiff had a crucial strategic importance in the wars between the Normans (who had occupied lowland Wales) and the Welsh who maintained their hold on the uplands. As a result Cardiff claims to have the largest concentration of [[castles]] of any city in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/rugbyunion/World_Cup/Story/0,21043,13092_2689478,00.html|title=2007 Rugby World Cup City Guides - Cardiff|publisher=Sky Sports|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> As well as Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, the remains of Twmpath Castle,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.castlewales.com/twmpath.html | title= Twmpath Castle | date=2002 | accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> the Llandaff Bishop's Palace and [[St Fagans National History Museum|Saint Fagans Castle]] are still in existence, whilst the site of Treoda (or Whitchurch Castle) has now been built over.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://homepage.mac.com/philipdavis/Welshsites/482.html | title=The Gatehouse: Treoda, Whitchurch | date=2007-10-08 | accessdate=2007-12-28}}</ref>

=== Language ===
''See also: [[Welsh English#Cardiff|Cardiff accent]]'' 
 
Cardiff has a chequered linguistic history with [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[English language|English]], [[Latin]], [[Norse]] and [[Norman-French]] preponderant at different times. Although it was the [[Romans]] who established the "castle on the Taff" it was the [[Viking]]s who began developing the maritime trade from which Cardiff was to derive its prosperity. The [[Vikings]]&mdash;who controlled the Bristol Channel&mdash;used Cardiff as a raiding base, a port and a trading post. Many street-names in Cardiff are of Viking origin including Dumballs Road and the oldest street in the city, Womanby Street (Womanby Street is a corruption of the original Norse name Humandaby Street). The conquest of Glamorgan by [[Robert Fitzhamon]] brought an influx of Norman-French influence. Welsh was the majority language in Cardiff from the 13th century until the city's explosive growth in the [[Victorian era]].<ref name="welsh">{{cite book | last=Jenkins | first=H Geraint | title=The Welsh Language before the Industrial Revolution | location=Cardiff | date=1997 | isbn=070831418X 9780708314180}}</ref> As late as 1850, five of the twelve [[Anglican]] churches within the current city boundaries conducted their services exclusively in the [[Welsh language]], while only two worshipped exclusively in English.<ref name="welsh" />

A substantial [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in Cardiff during the 19th century. They were drawn to Cardiff by the work available on major building and engineering projects in the docks and the city itself. The intermingling of the Irish, together with migrants from the [[West Country]], the [[Midlands]] and [[rural]] [[Mid Wales]] is credited with having formed the distinctive flat-vowelled "Cardiff accent" (Roots to Cardiff exhibition, 2007). By 1891 the percentage of Welsh speakers had dropped to 27.9% and only [[Lisvane]], [[Llanedeyrn]] and [[Creigiau]] remained as majority Welsh-speaking communities. The Welsh language became grouped around a small cluster of chapels and churches, the most notable of which is Tabernacl in the city centre, one of four UK churches chosen to hold official services to commemorate the new millennium. Following the establishment of the city's first Welsh School (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) in the 1950s, Welsh has slowly regained some ground.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2755217.stm | title=Census shows Welsh language rise|date=2003-02-14|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref>

Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from other parts of Wales, the number of Welsh speakers in Cardiff rose by 14,451 between 1991 and 2001; Welsh is now spoken by 11% of Cardiffians. The highest percentage of Welsh speakers is in [[Pentyrch]], where 15.9% of the population speak the language. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bwrdd-yr-iaith.org.uk/download.php/pID=9986.6 | format=PDF | title=Pentyrch Community Council Welsh Language Scheme | date=2003-06-01 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

In additional to English and Welsh, the diversity of Cardiff's population (including foreign students) means that a large number of languages are spoken within the city. One study has found that Cardiff has speakers of at least 94 languages, with [[Somali]], [[Urdu]], [[Bengali]] and [[Arabic]] being the most commonly spoken foreign languages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cilt.org.uk/pdf/pubs/positively_plurilingual.pdf | title=Positively Plurilingual | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>

Cardiff hosted the [[National Eisteddfod]] in 1883, 1899, 1938, 1960, 1978 and 2008. Cardiff is unique in Wales in having two permanent [[stone circles]] used by the Gorsedd of [[Bards]] during Eisteddfodau. The original circle stands in Gorsedd Gardens in front of the [[National Museum]] while its 1978 replacement is situated in [[Bute Park]].

Since 1983, Cardiff has hosted the [[BBC Cardiff Singer of the World]] competition, a world renowned event on the opera calendar which is held every two years. The city also hosts smaller events such as The [[Cardiff Design Festival]], which began showcasing the best of Welsh design during the summer of 2005, and has since grown into a diverse range of designers exhibiting their work. Cardiff also hosts the [[S<U+0175>n]] festival, a multiple venue music festival organised by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Huw Stevens]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualfestivals.com/Swn-Festival/|title=Swn Festival|publisher=Virtual Festivals|accessdate=2008-05-28}}</ref> The Cardiff Chinese New Year Celebrations, organised by Cardiff Chinese Community Services, are held annually at the Red Dragon Centre in Cardiff Bay.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chinesecommunityservices.co.uk/ | title=Cardiff Chinese Community Services | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>

The total number of higher education students in the city is around 30,000.<ref name="cityprofile">{{cite web | url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/profiles/00pt.asp | title=Census 2001 - Profiles - Cardiff | accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref> The city also has two [[further education]] colleges: [[Coleg Glan Hafren]] and St. David's College, although further education is offered at most high schools in the city.

Cardiff has eighty-six state primary schools (two bilingual, ten [[Education in Wales|Welsh medium]]), eleven infant schools, ten junior schools and twenty state secondary schools, of which two are Welsh medium.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/content.asp?nav=2869%2C3047%2C3062%2C3904&parent_directory_id=2865&positioning_article_id=&language=&sortkey= | title=Cardiff County Council - List of Schools | date=2007-02-27 | accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> There are also a number of independent schools in the city, including Llandaff Cathedral School, Kings Monkton and [[Howell's School Llandaff|Howell's School]], a single-sex girls' school (until sixth form). Notable schools include [[Whitchurch High School]] (the largest in Wales),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estyn.gov.uk/inspection_reports/Whitchurch_sec.pdf|title=Whitchurch High School: 2003 Inspection Report|last=Medhurst|first=B W|date=2003-03-28|publisher=[[Estyn]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> [[Fitzalan High School]] (which is one of the most multi-cultural state schools in the UK),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estyn.gov.uk/inspection_reports/Fitzalan_sec_2004.pdf|title=Fitzalan High School: 2004 Inspection Report|last=Owen|first=G|date=2004-12-13|publisher=[[Estyn]]|accessdate=2008-06-05}}</ref> and [[Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Glantaf]], which is the largest Welsh medium secondary in the country. 

As well as academic institutions, Cardiff is also home to other educational and learning organisations such as [[Techniquest]], a hands-on science discovery centre that now has franchises throughout Wales, and is part of the Wales Gene Park in collaboration with [[Cardiff University]], [[NHS Wales]] and the [[Welsh Development Agency]] (WDA).<ref>{{cite web | title=Wales Gene Park | url=http://www.wgp.cf.ac.uk/listWorkProgProEd.htm | accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> Cardiff is also home of the largest regional office of the [[International Baccalaureate]] Organisation (IBO). This office is home to the organisation's curriculum and assessment centre, which is responsible for overseeing the creation and grading of various IBDP assessments.

== Health ==
{{main |Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust}}
There are seven NHS hospitals in the city, the largest of which is the [[University Hospital of Wales]], which is also known as 'The Heath' or 'UHW', is the third largest hospital in the [[UK]] and deals with most accidents and emergencies. The University Dental Hospital, which provides emergency dental treatment, is also located on this site. Llandough Hospital is located in the south of the city. 

The city's newest hospital, St. David's Hospital (built behind the former building) is located in the Canton area and provides services for the elderly and children. [[Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust| Cardiff Royal Infirmary]] is located on Newport Road, near the city centre. The majority of this hospital was closed in 1999 but with the West Wing remaining open for clinic services, genitourinary medicine and rehabilitation treatment. [[Rookwood Hospital]] and [[Whitchurch Hospital]] are also located within the city, along with Llandaff and Velindre Hospital (which is run by a separate NHS trust). In addition [[BUPA]] has a hospital in the city which is located in Pentwyn.

== Telecommunications ==
{{see also|List of Wales dialling codes}}
'''029''' is the current telephone dialling code for [[Cardiff]], having previously been 0222 and then 01222. However it is vastly misconceived (in the city but on a larger scale in South Wales) to be 02920 because initially, at the time of the new dialing code system, all numbers began with 20. Currently all newly issued numbers begin with 21. The code includes the neighbouring towns of [[Penarth]], [[Dinas Powys]] and [[Caerphilly]].

The city's dialling code was changed on [[22 April]] [[2000]] from 01222 to 029 in the [[Big Number Change]] along with [[London]], [[Coventry]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Southampton]] and [[Northern Ireland]] in response to the rapid growth of telecommunications in the late 1990s and the impending exhaustion of numbers. This measure increased the numbers of digits in the subscriber telephone number from 6 to 8, therefore vastly increasing the possible telephone numbers available. 

[[Ofcom]] has allocated the range of telephone numbers from (029) 2018 0000 to (029) 2018 0999 to be used for drama purposes in television and radio. These numbers will not be allocated to telephone companies in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/ioi/numbers/num_drama | title=Number ranges allocated by OFCOM for drama purposes | publisher=OFCOM | accessdate=2008-05-20}}</ref>
