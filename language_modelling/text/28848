'''''What If We Fall In Love''''' is the only duet album by [[Crystal Gayle]].  All songs are performed by both Crystal Gayle and [[Gary Morris]]. Three of its tracks found positions on the [[Billboard Music Charts|Billboard]] Hot Country Singles chart. Chronologically, they were "Makin' Up for Lost Time", which reached the #1 position, "Another World", which was a #4 hit, and "All of This and More", which only rose to #26. The album itself rose to #25 on the Top Country Albums chart.

"Another World" became the theme song of the NBC daytime soap opera of the same name; Crystal appeared in a few shows of the series around this time as herself, almost becoming a victim of the serial killer plot airing at the time.  "Makin' Up for Lost Time" had been previously featured in the night time drama "Dallas."
