'''''Priwall''''' was a four-masted [[steel]]-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] [[barque]] which was built in 1917 in [[Germany]] for F Laiesz. Completion was not until 1920. She was used on the [[nitrate]] trade route to [[South America]], recording the fastest ever rounding of [[Cape Horn]] in 1938. In 1939, she was interned by the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean Government]]. In 1941 she was seized as a [[prize (law)|war prize]]. Renamed '''''Lautaro''''', she served until accidentally burnt out in 1945.

==Description==
''Priwall'' was built by [[Blohm+Voss]], [[Hamburg]]. She was launched on 23 June 1917 and completed on 6 March 1920, the delay being due to a shortage of materials in the aftermath of the [[First World War]].<ref name=Priwall2>{{cite web|url=http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Fourmast_ships/Priwall%281917%29.html |title=Priwall |publisher=Lars Bruzelius |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> She was {{convert|323|ft|1|in|m|2}} long, with a beam of {{convert|47|ft|1|in|m|2}} and a depth of {{convert|26|ft|3|in|m|2}}. She had a [[gross register tonnage|GRT]] of 3,185, and was 2,834 [[net register tonnage|NRT]].<ref name=Priwall30>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=30a0163.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, SAILING VESSELS |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> Her [[Deadweight tonnage|DWT]] was 4,800.<ref name=Priwall>{{cite web|url=http://sailing-ships.oktett.net/19.html |title=Priwall |publisher=Fredrik Sandstr<U+00F6>m |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref>

She had four masts and was rigged as a barque, with [[Royal (sail)|royal sails]] over double [[topsail|top]] and [[topgallant sail]]s.<ref name=Priwall/>

''Priwall'' was built for F Laeisz, Hamburg. She was seized by the Allies as [[World War I reparations]] for World War I in 1919.<ref name= "Carter p. 120"/>  But since sailing ships were of little value Laeisz was able to buy back the Priwall in 1924.<ref name= "Carter p. 120">{{harvnb|Carter|2004|p=120}}</ref>  She was used on the nitrate trade routes to South America, although she also made some voyages on the [[wheat]] trade route to [[Australia]].<ref name=Priwall/> Her [[code Letters]] were RWLN.<ref name=Priwall30/> In 1934, they were changed to DIRQ.<ref name=Priwall34>{{cite web|url=http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=34a0742.pdf |title=LLOYD'S REGISTER, NAVIRES A VOILES |publisher=Plimsoll Ship Data |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> Voyages made by ''Priwall'' were:-<ref name=Priwall2/><ref name=Jurgens>{{cite web|url=http://www.caphorniers.cl/priwall/last_rounding.htm |title=LAST ROUNDING OF THE "PRIWALL" |publisher=Caphorniers |accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref>
