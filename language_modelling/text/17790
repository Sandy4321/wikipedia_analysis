'''Traditional Chinese musical instruments''' comprise a wide range of string instruments (both bowed and plucked), wind instruments, and percussion instruments.  Traditionally, they were also classified according to the materials used in their construction.

=The Eight Sounds (<U+516B><U+97F3>)=
The eight classifications are: [[silk]], [[bamboo]], [[wood]], [[stone]], [[metal]], [[clay]], [[gourd]] and [[rawhide|hide]]. There are other instruments which may not fit these classifications. 

==Silk (<U+7D72>)==
Silk instruments are mostly [[string instruments]] (including plucked, bowed, and struck). Since the very beginning, the Chinese have used silk for strings, though today metal or nylon are more frequently used. Instruments in the silk category include:

=Playing contexts=

Chinese instruments are either played solo, or collectively in large orchestras (as in the former imperial court) or in smaller ensembles (in teahouses or public gatherings). Normally, there is no conductor in traditional Chinese music, or use of musical scores or tablature whilst in performance. Music was generally learned orally and memorized by the musician(s) beforehand, then played without aid, meaning totally accuracy and teamwork is required. But nowadays, music scores can be used, or a conductor if the number of musicians is large enough for that need.
