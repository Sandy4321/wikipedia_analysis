'''''New Found Glory''''' is the [[eponym]]ously titled second [[studio album]] by the American [[pop-punk]] band [[New Found Glory|of the same name]]. It was [[record producer|produced]] and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Neal Avron]] and released on September 26, 2000 through [[Drive-Thru Records]]. Featuring their breakthrough single "[[Hit or Miss (song)|Hit or Miss]]", the album was later certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) with sales in excess of 500,000 units.<ref name="riaa">{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA Search - New Found Glory|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2009-07-08}}</ref> 

During the band's [[concert tour|American tour]] in late 2009, they announced a special edition [[re-release]] of the album to celebrate its tenth anniversary. The deluxe package included new liner notes, seven [[b-sides]] and a [[DVD]].

==Background and recording==
Following the [[underground music|underground]] success of debut album ''[[Nothing Gold Can Stay (album)|Nothing Gold Can Stay]]'' (1999), [[Drive-Thru Records]] founder, [[Richard Reines]] had paid [[Eulogy Recordings]] [[US Dollar|$]]5,000 to licence the album and sign the band.<ref name="Oral3">{{Citation | title = 1999-2000: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i46.tinypic.com/2rz5rhg.jpg | newspaper = [[Alternative Press]] | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=64|accessdate=31 January 2010|issn = 1065-1667}}</ref>
Drive-Thru had initially wanted to [[re-release]] ''Nothing Gold Can Stay'' along with a newly recorded version of breakthrough single "[[Hit or Miss (song)|Hit or Miss]]".<ref name="Oral4">{{Citation | title = 2001-2005: The Oral History of New Found Glory | url = http://i47.tinypic.com/2ex7l9w.jpg | newspaper = [[Alternative Press]] | date = March 2010|author=Manley, Brendan|issue=260|page=65|accessdate=31 January 2010|issn = 1065-1667}}</ref> [[Chad Gilbert]] said of the process, "So we went into the studio with [[Jerry Finn]] and recorded it with him. I don't like how it came out, at all. He was ''such'' a cool guy, but we were like, "nah, we don't want to use it". From then on, every band that worked with him expressed that Jerry Finn didn't like our band".<ref name="Oral4"/> The song was never used and the band decided to start work on a second album. The recording was later included as a [[bonus track]] on the tenth anniversary edition of the album in 2010. 

Having met with producer Neal Avron, the two parties discussed the desired sound the band were striving for on the record. Avron said, "During pre-production, we'd get in their van for lunch and they had a poster of [[Britney Spears]] up. They wanted the music to be [[heavy music|heavy]], but the vocals to be super-[[pop music|pop]], that was the goal".<ref name="Oral4"/> Steve Klein, the band's [[rhythm guitarist]] and [[lyricist]], said of the writing: "A lot of those songs pertained to my early relationships, my first love, that entire time period. I was seventeen years old. Every record that we had is a timetable to my life. My wife can now look back and listen to my diaries as a teenager."<ref name="Oral4"/>

==Tenth anniversary edition and tour==

The additional material includes new liner notes, [[demo (music)|demos]], [[b-sides]], [[The Story So Far (2002 film)|''The Story So Far'' DVD]] and a [[remix]] of debut single "[[Hit or Miss (song)|Hit or Miss]]" by the late [[Jerry Finn]].<ref name="ST4"/> The re-issue also included a slightly altered version of the original [[cover art]] designed by Tim Stedman.

Upon the album's release, it was well received by [[music critics]]. [[Allmusic]] writer Richie Unterberger awarded the album a favorable 3<U+00BD> stars out of five. Despite stating the album wasn't "entirely original," he praised the record's "choppy uptempo [[rhythms]], spiky buzzing [[guitars]], and youthful [[harmonies]]." He also added that "there were less likable young punk bands that could have been honored with a record deal in 2000".<ref name="AMG"/> Michael Dabaie of ''[[College Music Journal]]'' was also favorable in his review. Comparing the band to [[Green Day]], [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]] and [[Blink-182]], he stated, "New Found Glory hits on a winning formula on its self-titled record: Without treading too far from the aggro path blazed years ago by bands like [[Dag Nasty]], the quintet delivers catchy pop-punk riffs, smooth vocal harmonies and songs that are angst-ridden without being nihilistic. These guys exude sincerity, and lyrics like "The needle on my record player is wearing thin/This record has been playing since the day you've been with him" will ring true with everyone who ever wore out their [[Descendents]] records during a bad breakup."<ref name="CMJ"/>

{{quote box|quote="Back when New Found Glory's ''self-titled'' album was released, there weren't many that gave it a chance to be one of the building-blocks for an entire genre.

British rock magazine, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' awarded the album a maximum five K! score. Describing the release as the band's "essential purchase," they also wrote, "Marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in alternative music, the band's major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the punk scene. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of Blink-182 for the genre's crown."<ref name="Kerrang2">{{cite web|url=http://www.kerrang.com/wheretostartwith/artists/new_found_glory|title=The Lowdown - New Found Glory|publisher=''[[Kerrang!]]''|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref> Fellow British magazine ''[[NME]]'', awarded the album 8/10 and opined the band had, "spot-on vocal harmonies that add just the right amount of pop tinge to [their] relentlessly hard-charging tunes."<ref name="NME"/> Writing for webzine [[PopMatters]], Andy Argyrakis was of the view that the band succeeded in writing simple, easily relatable songs that translate well in a live setting.<ref name="popmatters"/> He also added that, "The band<U+2019>s sound runs the gamut of many of the popular punk bands of today <U+2014> [[MXPX]], [[Blink-182]] and [[SR-71 (band)|SR-71]]."<ref name="popmatters"/> Reviewing the 10th Anniversary Edition in 2010, Adam Kennedy of ''[[Rock Sound]]'' explained that the re-issue was a "timely reminder of their bratty pop-punk beginnings. If heartfelt accounts of adolescent love and loss is what you're looking for, ''New Found Glory'' is as relevant today as ten years previous."<ref name="RSreview"/> ''Kerrang!'' also issued a new article covering its tenth anniversary re-issue. George Garner wrote "without them, pop-punk would be missing some of its most anthemic moments, and [[All Time Low]] wouldn't have their name."<ref name="Kerrang!">{{Citation | title = ''10th Birthday of Pop-Punk Legends' Breakthrough'' | url = http://i44.tinypic.com/2usvj1t.jpg | publisher = ''[[Kerrang!]]'' ([[Bauer Media Group]]) | date = April 2010|author=Garner, George|issue=1306|page=51|accessdate=3 April 2010|issn = 1740-9977}}</ref>

Arielle Castillo of the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' wrote a retrospective article on the album in 2010. She recalled how their "self-titled second album catapulted the Coral Springs quartet to national stardom. Released before [[emo]] had become a dirty word, the disc boasted a boisterous but sensitive pop-punk mood that was reflected on its cover - perfectly encapsulating the record's lyrical and sonic dance between teenage romantic naivet<U+00E9> and adulthood."<ref name="MNT"/> [[PopMatters]] writer Melissa Bobbit, whilst reviewing a show on the anniversary tour, enthused "what a blessing it is to still have NFG around, on this, the 10th anniversary of their self-titled record. This tour served as a collection of whimsical snapshots in their prolific career. New Found Glory<U+2019>s influence is vastly felt today. A testament to that was supporting act [[Fireworks (punk band)|Fireworks]], whose whiplash sound and choreographed jumping all came from the pages of the NFG guidebook to punk-pop."<ref name="PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/123046-new-found-glory-20-march-2010-anaheim-ca/|title=New Found Glory: 20 March 2010 - Anaheim, CA|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|author=Bobbitt, Melissa|date=29 March 2010|accessdate=11 April 2010}}</ref> Jason Tate, the [[:wikt:founder|founder]] and [[CEO]] of [[AbsolutePunk]], wrote of the album, "Back when New Found Glory's ''Self-Titled'' album was released there weren't many that gave it a chance to be one of the building-blocks for an entire genre.

New Found Glory just had something different and unique. I was really drawn to their melodies, and their guitar parts were more interesting and more creative than a lot of the stuff that was going on."<ref name="Oral4"/> It was also explained that when Jared Logan was producing [[Fall Out Boy]]'s [[Fall Out Boy's Evening Out with Your Girlfriend|debut album]], he asked bassist [[Pete Wentz]] about the sound the band had desired for recording. Wentz responded by "handing over the first two New Found Glory records".<ref name="Oral4"/> 

In November 2004, ''Kerrang!'' released a feature called "666 Songs You Must Own". In the "New School Punk" category, lead single "Hit or Miss" was placed at number fourteen.<ref name="K!666"/> Earlier in 2001, ''Rock Sound'' placed the album at number forty five in its annual "Critics' Poll of 2001",<ref name="RSpoll2001"/> while in 2012 it was formally inducted into its official [[Rock Sound#Hall Of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref name="RSHoF2"/> Later that year, the album again featured, this time at number 39 in the magazine's "101 Modern Classics", a list honoring the best albums between 1997 and 2012. Ben Patashnik expressed that "with this album, NFG capture the best parts of summer <U+2013> the girls, the sun, the house parties, the heartache, the misery <U+2013> and cram all of that into 36 hook-laden minutes. Few bands have stayed truer to their roots as NFG over the years, and ''New Found Glory'' started it all."<ref name="RSclassics"/>
