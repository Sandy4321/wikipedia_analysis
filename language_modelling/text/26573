'''Atorvastatin''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[<U+0259><U+02C8>t<U+0254>v<U+0259><U+02CC>st<U+00E6>tn]}}), marketed under the trade name '''Lipitor''' and several others, is a member of the drug class known as [[statin]]s, used for lowering [[cholesterol]]. Atorvastatin inhibits the rate-determining [[enzyme]] located in [[liver|hepatic tissue]] that produces mevalonate, a small molecule used in the synthesis of cholesterol and other mevalonate derivatives.  This lowers the amount of cholesterol produced which in turn lowers the total amount of [[LDL cholesterol]]. 

With 2005 sales of US$12.2 billion under the brand name Lipitor, it is the largest selling drug in the world.<ref>Jerry Avorn, M.D., "Torcetrapib and Atorvastatin <U+2014> Should Marketing Drive the Research Agenda?" ''New England Journal of Medicine'' Volume 352:2573-2576  June 23, 2005  Number 25. "Pfizer's trials will study torcetrapib only in combination with the company's widely used atorvastatin (Lipitor), the best-selling drug in the world."</ref>

==Pharmacology==
{{main|Statin}}

As with other statins, atorvastatin is a competitive [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Unlike most others, however, it is a completely [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] compound. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of [[HMG-CoA reductase pathway|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A]] (HMG-CoA) to [[mevalonate]], which is the [[Rate-determining step|rate-limiting step]] in hepatic [[cholesterol]] biosynthesis. Inhibition of the enzyme decreases ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' cholesterol synthesis, increasing expression of low-density lipoprotein receptors ([[LDL receptor]]s) on [[hepatocyte]]s. This increases LDL uptake by the hepatocytes, decreasing the amount of LDL-cholesterol in the blood. Like other statins, atorvastatin also reduces blood levels of [[triglyceride]]s and slightly increases levels of [[High density lipoprotein|HDL-cholesterol]].

==Clinical use==
===Indications===
Atorvastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of [[dyslipidaemia]], specifically [[hypercholesterolaemia]]. It has also been used in the treatment of [[combined hyperlipidemia]].<ref name="AMH2006">Rossi S, editor. [[Australian Medicines Handbook]] 2006. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook; 2006. ISBN 0-9757919-2-3</ref>

In 2005, the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial compared 40mg/day pravastatin with 80mg/day atorvastatin.<ref name="Rouleau2005">Rouleau J., Improved outcome after acute coronary syndromes with an intensive versus standard lipid-lowering regimen: results from the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial. Am J Med. 2005 Dec;118 Suppl 12A:28-35. PMID 16356805.</ref>  Taken directly from the results of the trial: "Standard treatment (statin) with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (pravastatin 40 mg/day) resulted in a 22% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at 30 days compared with a 51% reduction with intensive therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg/day). At 2 years, a relative risk reduction of 16% (95% confidence interval, 5%-26%; P = 0.005) in the primary end point rate (death, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularization, or stroke) was seen in patients receiving intensive statin treatment compared with standard statin therapy. The benefit of intensive treatment was apparent as early as 30 days and was consistent over time. The PROVE IT-TIMI 22 data indicate that patients recently hospitalized for an ACS benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current guideline recommendations."

===Available forms===
'''Atorvastatin calcium''' tablets are currently marketed by [[Pfizer]] under the trade name '''Lipitor''', in tablets (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg) for oral administration.  Tablets are white, elliptical, and film coated.  In some countries it may also be known as: '''Sortis''', '''Torvast''', '''Torvacard''', '''Totalip''', '''Tulip''', '''Xarator''', '''Atorpic''', or '''Liprimar'''. It is also packaged in combination with other drugs, such as is the case with Pfizer's [[Caduet]].

===Adverse effects===
{{dablink|For additional information see: [[Statin#Safety]]}}
Common [[adverse drug reaction]]s (<U+2265>1% of patients) associated with atorvastatin therapy include: [[myalgia]], mild transient gastrointestinal symptoms, elevated hepatic [[transaminase]] concentrations, headache, insomnia, and/or dizziness.<ref name="AMH2006" />

[[Myopathy]] and [[rhabdomyolysis]] occur in <0.1% of patients. Risk is increased in patients with [[renal failure|renal impairment]], serious concurrent illness; and/or concomitant use of drugs which inhibit [[CYP3A4]].<ref name="AMH2006" />

==Patent challenge==
The size of the market for atorvastatin has prompted the [[generic drug]] manufacturing company [[Ranbaxy]] to challenge the validity of some of Pfizer's [[patent]]s in patent courts across the world.  As of March 2007, courts had mostly upheld the validity of Pfizer's original patent for atorvastatin, which is due to expire in European territories in 2011 (but 2007 in Canada).  However a later patent for the specific [[enantiomer]] of the atorvastatin formula that is medically useful, which would have given Pfizer longer protection, has fared less well.  Although upheld in the [[United States]]<ref>BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4542358.stm Patent ruling hits Ranbaxy shares], 19 December 2005</ref>, [[Spain]], and [[Ecuador]], the enantiomer patent has been declared invalid by courts in [[Austria]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>Duncan Bucknell, [http://www.duncanbucknell.com/Scorecard%20-%20Lipitor.html The global Lipitor patent scorecard], retrieved 2007-03-03</ref>. In clinical trials, adding Zetia to Lipitor lowered cholesterol more than Vytorin does. The combination of ezetimibe with atorvastatin could be an important contributor controlling cholesterol.
