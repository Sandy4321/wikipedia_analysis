== History ==
Dacula started its history as the town of Chinquapin Grove.  However, the name was changed at founding, due in part to the fact that no chinquapin trees actually existed in the city.  The city of Dacula has a storied and colorful history dating back to a shocking murder in the early 1920s of a father and son.  Dacula is now more known for its large Memorial Day parade, professional and collegiate athletes, and lovely Little Mulberry Park.  

Dacula's name comes from letters in Decatur and Atlanta, two nearby cities that were already prospering at the time of Dacula's founding. The name "Dacula" is properly pronounced da-CUE-la.

The city was once home to a train station on a [[CSX]] line through Northeast [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], although the station closed back in the mid 1950's.  The city has experienced immense growth from a small, one light town in the early to late 80's, to now having nearly 10 public schools both from the Dacula and Mill Creek clusters of Gwinnett County Public Schools.  It is also home to one of the largest [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] churches in the Southeast United States, [[Hebron Baptist Church]], who recently finished construction of a 3,850 seat auditorium.

Dacula is home to the [[Auburn University]] star [[running back]] [[Kenny Irons]].  Linebacker [[Michael Boley]] of the [[Atlanta Falcons]] lives in Dacula. Jaletta Long, Dacula High class of 2001, attended and graduated Magna Cum Laude from Clemson University, where she was the Feature Twirler with the Clemson Tiger Marching Band.
