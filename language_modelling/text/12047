'''Philip Seymour Hoffman''' (July 23, 1967&nbsp;<U+2013> February 2, 2014) was an American actor and director. Although primarily a supporting player, Hoffman was known as a versatile performer who brought depth and humanity to all of his roles. He was prolific in both film and theater from the early 1990s until his death at age 46, when the ''[[New York Times]]'' declared him as "perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation".<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |first1=Bruce |last1=Weber |first2=J.

Raised in [[Fairport, New York]], Hoffman studied acting at the [[New York State Summer School of the Arts]] and the [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. He began his career in 1991 as a defendant in a rape case in an episode of ''[[Law & Order]]'', and the following year he began to appear in films. He gained recognition for his supporting work throughout the 1990s and early 2000s in minor but seminal roles in which he typically played losers or degenerates, including the portrayal of a conceited student in ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]'' (1992), a hyperactive storm-chaser in ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]'' (1996), a 1970s pornographic film boom operator in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' (1997), a smug assistant in ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), a hospice nurse in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'' (1999), a music critic in ''[[Almost Famous]]'' (2000), a phone-sex conman in ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'' (2002), and an immoral priest in ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]'' (2003).

In 2005, Hoffman portrayed the author [[Truman Capote]] in ''[[Capote (film)|Capote]]'', for which he won multiple acting awards including the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. His three other Oscar nominations came for his supporting work playing a brutally frank CIA officer in  ''[[Charlie Wilson's War]]'' (2007), a priest accused of pedophilia in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'' (2008), and the charismatic leader of a nascent [[Scientology]]-type movement in ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012). He also received critical acclaim for roles in ''[[Owning Mahowny]]'' (2003), ''[[Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]]'' (2007), ''[[The Savages (film)|The Savages]]'' (2007), ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008), ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Ides of March (film)|The Ides of March]]'' (2011). In 2010, Hoffman directed his first feature film, ''[[Jack Goes Boating (film)|Jack Goes Boating]]''.

Hoffman was also an accomplished theater actor and director. He joined the [[LAByrinth Theater Company]] in 1995, and directed and performed in numerous stage productions. His performances in three [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays led to Tony Award nominations: two for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play|Best Leading Actor]], in ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'' (2000) and ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (2012), and one for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play|Best Featured Actor]] in ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' (2003). Hoffman struggled with [[drug addiction]] as a young adult, and relapsed in 2012 after many years of sobriety. In February 2014, he died of [[combined drug intoxication]] <U+2013> an unexpected event that was widely lamented by the film and theater industries.

===Theatrical success and leading roles (2000<U+2013>04)===
Following a string of roles in successful films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established a reputation as a top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each appearance.{{sfn|Pomerance|2011|pp=109, 114}}  The experience of seeing Hoffman pop up in various films was likened by David Kamp of GQ to "discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend".{{sfn|Pomerance|2011|p=110}} According to Murray Pomerance, as the year 2000 began, "it seemed Hoffman was everywhere, poised on the cusp of stardom".{{sfn|Pomerance|2011|p=109}}

Hoffman's first screen role of the new millennium came in [[David Mamet]]'s comedy ''[[State and Main]]'' (2000), about the difficulties of shooting a film in rural [[New England]].

In 2001, Hoffman featured as the narrator and interviewer in ''[[The Party's Over (2001 film)|The Party's Over]]'', a documentary about the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. elections]]. He assumed the position of a "politically informed and alienated Generation-Xer" who seeks to be educated in U.S. politics, but ultimately reveals the extent of public dissatisfaction in this area.{{sfn|Kellner|2011|p=56}} Following this, Hoffman was given his first leading role (despite joking at the time "Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I'd probably turn it into the non-leading-man part."){{sfn|Pomerance|2011|p=114}} in [[Todd Louiso]]'s tragicomedy ''[[Love Liza]]'' (2002). His brother [[Gordy Hoffman|Gordy]] wrote the script, about a widow who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years earlier. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, "incredibly humble in its exploration of grief",<ref name="SS03"/> but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the [[BBC]] wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed "what he's truly capable of",<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Jamie|title=Love Liza (2003)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/01/07/love_liza_2003_review.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=February 19, 2014|date=January 25, 2003}}</ref> but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only $210,000.{{sfn|Pomerance|2011|p=115}}

Hoffman's second role of the year came opposite [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Amy Adams]] in [[John Patrick Shanley]]'s ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]'', where he played Father Brendan Flynn <U+2013> a priest accused of [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] a 12-year-old African-American student in the 1960s.

===Final projects (2010<U+2013>14)===
[[File:Philip Seymour Hoffman crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hoffman at the ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'' premiere in September 2011]]

Hoffman's profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became a well-known public figure.<ref name="cnn"/> Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen,<ref name="Buffalo900"/> his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The indie drama ''[[Jack Goes Boating (film)|Jack Goes Boating]]'' was adapted from [[Robert Glaudini]]'s play of the same name, which Hoffman had starred in and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack <U+2013> a lonely limousine driver looking for love <U+2013> after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://collider.com/paul-thomas-anderson-interviews-philip-seymour-hoffman-about-jack-goes-boating/|title=Paul Thomas Anderson Interviews Philip Seymour Hoffman About JACK GOES BOATING|last=Lussier|first=Germain|year=2011|work=The Collider|accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref> The low-key film had a limited release and was not a high earner,<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Goes Boating|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jackgoesboating.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}</ref> but it received mainly positive reviews.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Jack Goes Boating at Rotten Tomatoes  | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jack_goes_boating/ | accessdate =April 26, 2011}}</ref> The film critic [[Mark Kermode]] appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jack Goes Boating reviewed by Mark Kermode|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00lp7vd|publisher=BBC Radio 5|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}</ref> In addition to ''Jack Goes Boating'', in 2010 Hoffman also directed [[Brett C.

Hoffman next had significant supporting roles in two films, both released in the fall of 2011. In ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]'', a sports drama about the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 season]] of the baseball team [[Oakland Athletics]], he played the manager [[Art Howe]]. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hoffman was described as "perfectly cast" by Ann Hornaday of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', but the real-life Art Howe accused the filmmakers of giving an "unfair and untrue" portrayal of him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/moneyball |title=Moneyball |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}<br>{{cite web|title=Moneyball|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=moneyball.htm|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}<br>{{cite news|author=Hornaday, Ann|title=Moneyball|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/moneyball,1177497.html#reviewNum1|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Oakland-Athletics-Art-Howe-former-manager-upset-with-Moneyball-portrayal-Billy-Beane-092711 |title=Howe upset with 'Moneyball' portrayal |publisher=[[Fox Sports]] |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 16, 2012}}</ref> Hoffman's second film of the year was [[George Clooney]]'s political drama ''[[The Ides of March (film)|The Ides of March]]'', in which he played the earnest campaign manager to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate Mike Morris (Clooney).

In the spring of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance when he starred as [[Willy Loman]] in a Broadway revival of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the [[Ethel Barrymore Theatre]]'s history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Death of a Salesman|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=491286|publisher=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}<br>{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/INDUSTRY-INSIGHT-Weekly-Grosses-Analysis-64-ONCE-SALESMAN-Have-Record-Weeks-20120604|title= INDUSTRY INSIGHT: Weekly Grosses Analysis - 6/4; ONCE & SALESMAN Have Record Weeks|publisher=BroadwayWorld.com|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref> Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young for the role of 62-year-old Loman,<ref name="NYT"/> and he admitted that it was a difficult role,<ref name="master"/> but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.<ref name="ibdb"/>

Hoffman collaborated with Paul Thomas Anderson for the fifth and final time in ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'' (2012), where he turned in what critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] considered the most memorable performance of his career.<ref name="bradshaw"/> Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent [[Scientology]]-type movement who brings a troubled man ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]) under his tutelage.

Hoffman's other film release of 2012 was ''[[A Late Quartet]]'', where he played a violinist in a string quartet whose members face a crisis when one is diagnosed with [[Parkinson's Disease]]. The drama received favorable reviews, and Stephen Holden of the ''New York Times'' called Hoffman's performance "exceptional".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/movies/a-late-quartet-directed-by-yaron-zilberman.html|title=The Strings Play On; The Bonds Tear Apart|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=November 1, 2012|work=New York Times|accessdate=February 16, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_late_quartet |title=A Late Quartet |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=[[Flixter]] |accessdate=February 2, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, Hoffman joined the popular ''[[The Hunger Games (film series)|Hunger Games]]'' series for its second release ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'', where he played the gamemaker [[Plutarch Heavensbee]].

I think the more benign you make somebody, the less truthful it is."{{sfn|Pomerance|2011|p=109}} But in a 2012 interview he confessed that this was not easy: "It's hard. The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult ... just because you like to do something doesn't mean you have fun doing it; and I think that's true about acting".<ref name="gilbey"/> In an earlier interview with ''The New York Times'', he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it<U+2019>s torturous because you know it<U+2019>s a beautiful thing. I was young once, and I said, That<U+2019>s beautiful and I want that. Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great <U+2014> well, that<U+2019>s absolutely torturous.<U+201D><ref name="higher"/>

Hoffman's unexpected death was widely lamented by fans and the film industry, and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession.<ref name="Hunt"/><ref name="collin"/><ref name="bradshaw"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Seymour Hoffman Dead at 46: Celebrities React to Shocking Death|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/philip-seymour-hoffman-dead-46-celebrities-react-shocking-death-201422|publisher=US Weekly|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}<br>{{cite web|title=Twitter Reacts in Shock and Grief Over Death of Philip Seymour Hoffman|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2014/02/twitter-reacts-in-shock-and-grief-over-death-of-philip-seymour-hoffman/|publisher=ABC|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref> To honor his memory, on February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth theatre company held a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Broadway To Dim Its Lights In Memory of Philip Seymour Hoffman|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/03/philip-seymour-hoffman-broadway_n_4718305.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Philip Seymour Hoffman death: Broadway dims its lights for theatre star|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-26062286|publisher=BBC|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}</ref> His funeral was held at [[Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (New York City)|St. Ignatius Loyola]] church in Manhattan, on February 7, 2014, and was attended by many of his former co-stars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Francescani|first=Chris|title=Family, actors mourn Philip Seymour Hoffman at private funeral|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/08/us-philipseymourhoffman-idUSBREA1604A20140208|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref>
