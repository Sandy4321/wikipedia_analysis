'''''Marquee Moon''''' is the debut album by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Television (band)|Television]]. It was released on February 8, 1977, by [[Elektra Records]].

While often considered a seminal work to emerge from the New York [[Punk rock|punk]] scene of the mid-to-late 1970s, the album differed from conventional punk in its textured, guitar-based instrumental interplay and extended improvisation. As a result, it is also often cited as important to the development of [[post-punk]] in the late 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Erlewine"/>

"As peculiar as it sounds," [[Tom Verlaine]] remarked, "I've always thought that we were a pop band. You know, I always thought ''Marquee Moon'' was a bunch of cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, this song is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos."<ref>''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' September 1992</ref>

Though it was critically acclaimed at the time of its release, the album failed to garner commercial success. ''Marquee Moon'' has since been cited by numerous publications as one of the greatest albums of rock music.

== Background ==
By the mid 1970s, [[Television (band)|Television]] had become a leading act in the [[Music of New York City|New York music scene]] and helped persuade [[Hilly Kristal]] to feature more unconventional musical groups at his club [[CBGB]]. They waited for an appropriate record deal and turned down a number of major labels, including [[Island Records]], for whom they had recorded demos with producer [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Agarwal et al.|2007|p=378}} Eno had produced demos of the songs "Prove It", "Friction", "Venus", and "Marquee Moon" in December 1974, but Television frontman [[Tom Verlaine]] did not approve of his sound: "He recorded us very cold and brittle, no resonance. We're oriented towards really strong guitar music ... sort of [[Expressionist music|expressionistic]]."<ref name="Hoskyns">{{cite journal|last=Hoskyns|first=Barney|authorlink=Barney Hoskyns|month=January|year=2004|title=Television: Marquee Moon (Expanded); Adventure (Expanded) (Rhino)|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|location=London}}</ref> After founding bassist [[Richard Hell]] left in 1975, Television enlisted [[Fred Smith (bassist)|Fred Smith]], whom they found more reliable and rhythmically adept. The band quickly developed a rapport and a musical style that reflected their individual influences: Smith and guitarist [[Richard Lloyd (guitarist)|Richard Lloyd]] had a [[rock and roll]] background, drummer [[Billy Ficca]] was a [[jazz]] enthusiast, and Verlaine's tastes varied from the [[13th Floor Elevators]] to [[Albert Ayler]].{{sfn|Agarwal et al.|2007|p=378}}

In preparation for the album's recording, Television rehearsed for four to six hours a day and six to seven days a week. Lloyd said that they were "both really roughshod musicians on one hand and desperadoes on the other, with the will to become good." Once the band signed to [[Elektra Records]], Verlaine insisted they not have to be guided in the recording studio by a famous producer. Instead, they enlisted engineer [[Andy Johns]], who Lloyd said had produced "some of the great guitar sounds in [[rock music|rock]]". Television recorded ''Marquee Moon'' in September 1976 at [[A & R Recording]] in [[New York City]]. Johns produced the album with Verlaine.{{sfn|Agarwal et al.|2007|p=378}} They recorded two new songs for the album<U+2014>"Guiding Light" and "Torn Curtain"<U+2014>and older songs such as "Friction", "Venus de Milo", and the title track, which had become a standard at their live shows.{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=269}} Elektra did not query Television's studio budget.{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=271}}

== Music and lyrics ==
''Marquee Moon'' is a [[post-punk]] album.<ref name="RS">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/elevation-television|title=Elevation by Television|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann S.

The title track and "Torn Curtain" are longer and more [[Jam session|jam]]-oriented.<ref name="Chakroff"/> The former song was recorded in one [[take]], which Ficca assumed was a rehearsal. When Johns suggested they record another take, Verlaine told him "forget it".<ref name="RS"/> Jason Heller of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' described the album as an "elegantly jagged [[art-punk]] opus".<ref name="Heller">{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Jason|date=March 9, 2011|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/1977,52861/|title=1977|newspaper=[[The A.V.

Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars between drum hits and basslines.<ref name="Chakroff">{{cite web|last=Chakroff|first=Evan|date=August 1, 2003|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/television-marquee-moon.htm|title=Television - Marquee Moon - On Second Thought|publisher=[[Stylus Magazine]]|accessdate=April 1, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6G41QR5Tm|archivedate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> Their dual guitar playing drew on 1960s rock and [[avant-garde jazz]] styles,{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=541}} and eschewed the layered [[power chord]]s of contemporary punk rock for melodic lines and [[counter-melodies]].<ref name="Chakroff"/> Verlaine established the song's rhythmic [[phrase (music)|phrase]], against which Lloyd played [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] melodies. Lloyd later said of their approach: "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a [[jigsaw puzzle]]. It was what we were obsessed with when we recorded."{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=769}} They traded rhythm and melodic lines several times on some songs and produced [[tension (music)|tension]].{{sfn|Agarwal et al.|2007|p=378}} Most of the [[solo (music)|solos]] on ''Marquee Moon'' follow a pattern wherein Verlaine runs up a [[major scale]] but regresses slightly after each [[Steps and skips|step]].{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=167}} Verlaine played in a [[Mixolydian mode]] and lowered the [[major seventh|seventh]] by half a step on the title track, and on "See No Evil", he soloed through a full [[octave]] before playing a [[blues]]-influenced [[riff (music)|riff]].{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=168}}

The album's lyrics combine urban and [[pastoral literature|pastoral]] imagery.{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=16}} Although it is not a [[concept album]], ''Marquee Moon'' features geographical references to [[lower Manhattan]].{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=162}} Its songs celebrate stern adolescence in the urban pastoral [[Mode (literature)|mode]].{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=163}} The album's urban [[nocturne]] theme derived from poetic works about [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] decadence.{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=162}} The lyrics also incorporate maritime imagery, including the paradoxical "nice little boat made out of ocean" in "See No Evil", the waterfront setting in "Elevation", parting "like the seas" in "Guiding Light", and references to docks, caves, and waves in "Prove It".{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=166}} 

Verlaine's lyrical style drew on influences from [[French poetry]].{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=162}} He narrated the consciousness or confusion of an experience rather than its specific details. Verlaine compared the songs to "a little moment of discovery or releasing something or being in a certain time or place and having a certain understanding of something."{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=17}} "See No Evil" opens with the narrator's [[wikt:flight of fancy|flights of fancies]] and closes with an imperative about limitless possibilities: "Runnin wild with the one I love / Pull down the future with the one you love".{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=168}} Verlaine used puns and double-entendres in his lyrics, which he said were atmospheric in an interview for ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'' magazine: "You don't have to say what you mean to get across."{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=161}}

== Artwork ==
The album's cover was shot by photographer [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], who had previously shot the cover for [[Patti Smith]]'s 1975 album ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''. His photo for ''Marquee Moon'' situated Verlaine a step in front of the rest of the band, who are in a tensed, serious prose. Verlaine held his right hand across his body and held his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the [[contact print]]s, Lloyd took their favorite shot to a print shop in [[Times Square]] and asked for color [[photocopies]] for the band members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to make more "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed."{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=159}} He likened the process to [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[Screen printing|screen prints]]. After he showed it to the band, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith had framed and kept for himself.{{sfn|Waterman|2011|p=160}}

== Critical reception ==
Released in February 1977,{{sfn|Agarwal et al.|2007|p=378}} ''Marquee Moon'' was acclaimed by contemporary [[music journalism|music critics]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Down Beat]]|page=40|month=December|year=1982|volume=49|title=Record Reviews}}</ref> Peter Gammond of ''[[Hi-Fi News & Record Review]]'' gave it an "A+" and called it one of the most exciting releases in music, highlighted by "pure rock" and Verlaine's steely, [[G<U+00E1>bor Szab<U+00F3>]]-like guitar.<ref name="Gammond">{{cite journal|journal=[[Hi-Fi News & Record Review]]|page=141|volume=22|title=Records of the Month|last=Gammond|first=Peter|month=March|year=1977|volume=22|issue=3}}</ref> ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' magazine's [[Jon Tiven]], who graded the album's performance an "A" and its sound a "B", wrote that, although his vocals and production could be more amplified, Verlaine's lyrics and guitar "manage to viscerally and intellectually grab the listener".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Record Reviews|journal=[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]|month=March|year=1977|page=90|last=Tiven|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Tiven}}</ref> Joan Downs of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' felt that the band's sound is distinguished more by Lloyd's brazen guitar and said that he has the potential to become a major figure in rock guitar.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Downs|first=Joan|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|location=New York|at=Music section, p. 82|volume=109|title=Television: Marquee Moon|date=April 11, 1977}}</ref> [[Nick Kent]], writing in ''[[NME]]'' magazine, said that Television are ambitious and skilled enough to achieve "new dimensions of sonic overdrive", and hailed the album as an "inspired work of pure genius, a record finely in tune and sublimely arranged with a whole new slant on [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]".{{sfn|Kent et al.|1993|pp=234}} He also claimed that the music is vigorous, sophisticated, and innovative at a time when rock music is wholly conservative.{{sfn|Kent et al.|1993|pp=235, 239}} [[Robert Christgau]], writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', asserted that the "[[wikt:demotic#Adjective|demotic]]-philosophical" lyrics could sustain the album alone, as would the guitar playing, which he called "as lyrical and piercing as" [[Eric Clapton]] or [[Jerry Garcia]] "but totally unlike either."<ref name="Christgau">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=March 21, 1977|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv3-77.php|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=March 31, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6G41YdeHb|archivedate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> 

In a negative review, Noel Coppage of ''[[Stereo Review]]'' panned the singing and songwriting, and wrote that the album sounds more like a stale version of [[Bruce Springsteen]] than [[avant-garde music]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Stereo Review]]|page=94|month=March|year=1977|volume=38|issue=3|title=Television: Marquee Moon|last=Coppage|first=Noel}}</ref> ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' magazine's Nigel Hunter found both Verlaine's lyrics and guitar playing vague, and felt that listeners need a "strong commitment to this type of music to get much out of it."<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]|volume=55|issue=650|location=London|month=July|year=1977|last=Hunter|first=Nigel|title=Rock Albums|page=237}}</ref> [[Ken Tucker]], writing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', said that the lyrics generally amount to [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequiturs]], meaningless phrases, and "[[wikt:puffy|puffy]]" aphorisms, but are secondary to the music.

== Commercial performance ==
''Marquee Moon'' was an unexpected success in the United Kingdom, where it reached number 28 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=269}} The album's two [[single (music)|singles]]<U+2014>the title track and "Prove It"<U+2014>both charted on the [[UK Singles Chart|UK Top 30]].{{sfn|Martin et al.|2003|p=1060}} Its sales were partly fueled by Kent's rave two-page review of the album for ''NME''. While holidaying in London after the album's completion, Verlaine saw that the band had been put on the magazine's front cover and called Elektra's [[press service|press department]], who encouraged Television to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's [[Middle America (United States)|middle-American]], progressive rock audiences and found the tour unnerving. In the United States, ''Marquee Moon'' sold less than 80,000 copies and failed to [[record chart|chart]] on the [[Billboard 200|Top 200]].{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=270}}

In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour in the UK and were enthusiastically received by audiences. Verlaine said that it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after having played clubs for four years, but that supporting act [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] were ill-suited for their show.{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=270}} Blondie's [[Chris Stein]] said that Television were "so competitive" and unaccommodating on the tour, and recalled one show where "all our equipment was shoved up at the [[The Apollo (Glasgow)|[Glasgow] Apollo]] and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space."{{sfn|Heylin|2005|pp=270<U+2013>1}} By Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting ''Marquee Moon'', which they dismissed as a commercial non-starter.{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=271}} The band was dispirited by their failure to meet commercial expectations, which led to their disbandment in 1978.{{sfn|Heylin|2005|p=270}}

According to [[Sputnikmusic]]'s Adam Downer, the album "introduced the world to post-punk" with its unprecedented style of rock and roll.<ref name="Downer">{{cite web|last=Downer|first=Adam|date=September 29, 2006|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9340/Television-Marquee-Moon/|title=Review: Television - Marquee Moon|publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]]|accessdate=April 1, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6G41WBMZH|archivedate=April 22, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that it scaled "amazing new heights of sophistication and intensity" as a "gorgeous, ringing beacon of post-punk, even if it did come out six months before ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/nov/22/1000tohearbeforeyoudie1|title=1000 albums to hear before you die: Artists beginning with T|work=guardian.co.uk|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=May 29, 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6GzRguEn2|archivedate=May 29, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] said that the album was innovative for eschewing the "sense of [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] or [[groove (music)|groove]]" of previous guitar rock and New York punk albums for a "heady intellectual" scope that Television achieved instrumentally rather than lyrically. Erlewine asserted that "it's impossible to imagine post-punk soundscapes" without the album, which he said remains a "fresh" listen because of "how Television flesh out Verlaine's poetry into sweeping sonic epics."<ref name="Erlewine"/>

=== Rock guitar ===
Verlaine and Lloyd's dual guitar playing on the album strongly influenced [[the Strokes]],{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=541}} alternative rock bands such as [[the Pixies]], [[noise rock]] acts such as [[Sonic Youth]], and big arena acts like [[U2]].{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=769}} In his work with U2, guitarist [[The Edge]] simulated their guitar sound by himself with an [[effects unit|effects pedal]].{{sfn|Moon|2008|p=770}} He said that he wanted to "sound like them" and that the album's title track had changed his "way of thinking about the guitar."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pattenden|first=Mike|date=January 2, 2010|url=https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Ftto%2Farts%2Fmusic%2F|title=The Edge on guitarists, Glasbonbury and musicals|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|accessdate=April 1, 2013}} {{subscription required}}</ref> [[Rob Sheffield]] of ''Rolling Stone'' called ''Marquee Moon'' "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" and said that the songs' tremulous, guitar twang shows how Television inspired bands such as [[R.E.M.]] and [[Joy Division]].<ref name="Sheffield">{{cite journal|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|date=October 16, 2003|page=90|title=Review: Marquee Moon|journal=Rolling Stone|location=New York}}</ref> Joy Division's [[Stephen Morris (musician)|Stephen Morris]] cited it as one of his favorite albums: "I just felt that ''Marquee Moon'' and the stuff from New York was odd, and it was different, and it was weird ...
