'''Sir Thomas Playford''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]] ([[July 5]] [[1896]] <U+2013> [[16 June]] [[1981]]) was a prominent [[South Australia]]n politician and farmer. He served continuously as [[Premier of South Australia]] from [[5 November]] [[1938]] to [[10 March]] [[1965]],   the longest term of any democratically elected leader in the history of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. His tenure as premier was marked by a period of population and economic growth unmatched by any other [[States and territories of Australia|Australian state]]. Playford took a unique, strong and direct approach to the premiership and personally oversaw his industrial initiatives. His string of election wins were assisted by a system of [[Apportionment (politics)|electoral malapportionment]] that bore his name, the '[[Playmander]]'.

Born into an old [[Playford family|political family]], Playford was the fifth Thomas Playford and the fourth to have lived in South Australia. He grew up on the family farm in [[Norton Summit, South Australia|Norton Summit]] before enlisting in the [[Australian Imperial Force]] in [[World War I]], fighting in [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and Western Europe. After serving, he continued farming until his election as a [[Liberal and Country League]] (LCL)  representative for [[Electoral district of Murray (South Australia)|Murray]] in 1932. With the resignation of the LCL's leader, [[Richard Layton Butler]], Playford ascended to the [[Premier of South Australia|premiership]] in 1938.

In office, Playford used his negotiating skills to encourage industry to relocate to South Australia during [[World War II]], and built upon this in the post-war boom years. Although a [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]], his approach to economics was pragmatic, and he was derided by his colleagues for his "socialism" as he nationalised electricity companies and used state enterprises to drive economic growth. However, Playford and his party failed to adapt to changing social mores and eventually lost office in the [[South Australian legislative election, 1965|1965 election]]. He relinquished the LCL leadership to [[Steele Hall]] and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards until his death in 1981.

==Family==
{{seealso|Playford family}}
The Playford family heritage can be traced back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in [[Barnby Dun]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The occupants of the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =7-9}}</ref> The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the first born son in the family in this way has continued since.

[[Image:Thomas Playford I.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Thomas Playford I, soldier and pastor. He was the second Thomas Playford and the first to have lived in South Australia.]]
The second Playford was something of a loner, but at the age of 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child. In order to avoid the social stigma of the situation, and on the advice of his parents, Playford enlisted in the [[British Army]] in 1810. While three years under the acceptable age, Playford's size (6" 2") enabled him to pass as eighteen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =10}}</ref> He spent 24 years in the service of the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Light Guards]], fighting all over Europe in [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[France]], including the [[Battle of Waterloo]] at the age of 20.

While a soldier, Playford became a devout Christian, and journeyed and listened to many different churches and sermons. He was sceptical of many pastors and church men, dismissing their "high sounding barren words".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =15}}</ref> He left the Life Guards in 1834, received a land grant in [[Canada]] for his service, and journeyed there with his wife and family. His wife and a child died in the country, so he and his remaining kin returned to England. He worked as a historian for the Life Guards until 1844 when he migrated to the then-province of [[South Australia]]. Playford became a pastor there, built a property at [[Mitcham, South Australia|Mitcham]], and preached regularly for his own 'Christian Church', which was essentially [[Baptist]] in character.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =17}}</ref>

[[Image:Thomas playford II.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Thomas Playford II, premier and senator.]]
The third Playford, [[Thomas Playford II]], was born at [[Bethnal Green]], [[London]] in 1837 to the second wife of Pastor Playford. He was raised on the Mitcham property in South Australia, was intellectual and book-minded, and wished to go the prestigious [[St Peter's College, Adelaide|St Peter's College]] to study law. He was rebuked by his father and subsequently became a farmer like his predecessors, buying property at [[Norton Summit, South Australia|Norton Summit]] and growing vegetables, plums and apples.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =18-21}}</ref> He was elected to the local [[Adelaide Hills Council|East Torrens Council]] in 1863 at the age of 27; and then to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|State Parliament]] in 1868 as a 'liberal' (parties had not yet formed), representing the constituency of [[State electoral district of Onkaparinga|Onkaparinga]]. He became known as 'Honest Tom' for his straightforward and blunt ways. He lost his seat in 1871 and regained it in 1875 only to loose it again until he was re-elected in 1887, upon which he became Premier of South Australia. He subsequently lost the premiership in 1889, regained it in 1890, and then spent a great deal of his term absent in [[India]]. After losing an election, he relocated to London to represent South Australia as [[Agent General]] to the United Kingdom. While in England, Playford was three times offered a knighthood, but declined it each time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =22-23}}</ref>

He returned to [[South Australia]] to assist [[Charles Kingston]] in his government, but ultimately crossed the floor to bring down Kingston over his plans to lessen the power of the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. With the advent of [[Federation of Australia|Australian Federation]] Playford <!--proposed the name '[[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]]',{{fact}} and -->became a Senator for South Australia. He was leader of the Senate and the 7th Minister for Defence. After one term as a Senator, Playford was defeated. He ran again in 1910, was unsuccessful, and retired to [[Kent Town, South Australia|Kent Town]], where he died in 1915 at the age of 78.<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110251b.htm?hilite=Thomas%3BPlayford Playford, Thomas. Australian Dictionary of Biography.] Accessed 25-11-2006.</ref>

The fourth Playford, father of Sir Thomas, was born in 1861. Unlike his own father and grandfather, who had led lives as soldiers, church men and politicians, he became a simple farmer at the Norton Summit property and was dominated by his wife, Elizabeth. He was, like his forebears, a regular churchgoer, and only once was involved in politics with a short stint on the East Torrens District Council. In comparison, Elizabeth was the local correspondent of the ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'', treasurer and chief member of the local Baptist Church, and a teacher. Four children were born to the couple; three daughters and one son, Sir Thomas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =24-30}}</ref>

==Early life==
Thomas Playford was the third child born to the family, with two sisters before him and one following. He started school at the age of six, going to the local Norton Summit School. The school had one room, one teacher, two assistants, 60 students and taught children aged six to twelve. Playford, while an adept learner, frequently argued with his teacher, and was the first child to have been caned there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =27-35}}</ref> While learning, he accompanied his father down to the East End Markets with their farming produce. Playford would late dub the East End Markets his 'university', due to the work that he carried out there. 

It was the influence of Playford's mother Elizabeth that contributed to his relative Puritanism and social habits. She was a devout Baptist Christian, and it was primarily because of her that he abstained from alcohol, smoking and gambling throughout his lifetime. However, despite her influence on his social habits, he did not regularly attend church like his family.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =210}}</ref>

[[Image:Norton summit hills.jpg|240px|left|thumb|Playford's forebears had lived in the town of Norton Summit for generations. Pictured here are market gardens on the hills near the town.]]
His father suffered a fall and a broken leg when Playford was thirteen. He requested permission to leave school and take over the family farm; this was granted, and the boy, even after his father had recovered, dominated the management of the farm.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =39}}</ref> While out of school, Playford continued to learn; he joined the local Norton Summit Society, and took part in classes and debates in [[Adelaide]]. He won a public speaking award for a speech he made to an Adelaide literary society.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =41}}</ref>

[[World War I]] broke out in 1914 and Playford wished to join the [[First Australian Imperial Force|AIF]]. His parents persuaded him to assist them on the farm until close to his 19th birthday. He entered Keswick Barracks on [[17 May]] [[1915]] and was placed in the 27th Battalion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =43}}</ref> The news of the bloody landings at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] had not reached Adelaide by the time Playford left on HMAT ''Geelong'' on 31 May. The Geelong picked up more soldiers at [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and then sailed to [[Suez]], [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =44-46}}</ref> The Australian soldiers received training in Egypt, but during the evenings left their camps to indulge themselves in the Egyptian towns and cities. Frequent fights broke out between the Australian troops and the locals, with responsible soldiers left to take the rest back to camp. Playford assisted in this and dragged Australian soldiers from the beds of Egyptian prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =47}}</ref> Training was completed after two months and Playford landed at [[Anzac Cove]] on [[12 September]] [[1915]]. 

[[Image:27th battalion france.JPG|300px|right|thumb|The 27th Battalion, which Playford was a soldier of, enters the town of Beaucourt-sur-l'Ancre in the [[Somme]], [[France]].]]
After taking part in the Gallipoli campaign, Playford and his battalion left for France on [[15 March]] [[1916]]. He fought on the [[Western Front]] and was shot and wounded on 20 October, evacuated to London, and kept out of action for a year. Playford endured many operations during this time to remove the [[shrapnel]] that had penetrated his body, although some of it remained within him, and his hearing was permanently damaged. Turning down an offer for a staff job in [[India]], Playford returned to his battalion in October 1917 and continued fighting in [[Belgium]] and [[France]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =22}}</ref>

With the end of the [[World War I|Great War]], Playford returned to South Australia with his battalion, disembarking at [[Outer Harbor, South Australia|Outer Harbor, Adelaide]] on [[2 July]] [[1919]]. He had received no decorations, but had nonetheless attained the rank of [[Officer]] by the time he was honourably discharged in October. Despite Playford's intellectual capability, he shunned the Government's offer of free university education for soldiers and returned to his orchard. He continued growing cherries on the property, and engaged in his hobby of [[horticulture]]. His involvement in various organisations and clubs was renewed.

Through relatives Playford met his future wife Lorna Clark, who lived with her family in [[Nailsworth, South Australia|Nailsworth]]. Although both families were religiously devout, the Clarks were even more so than the Playfords, and a long courtship pursued. Taking her out on his Harley Davidson motorcycle at night, the two were forced to leave the theatre half-way through performances so as to not raise the ire of the Clarks. Before their wedding on [[1 January]] [[1928]], they were engaged for three years. During their engagement, Playford built their new house on his property, mostly by his own hands and indented in the hills themselves; it remained their home throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =57-59}}</ref>

Two years later, on [[Christmas]] Day, 1930, the family's first daughter was born, Patricia. Two more children were born to the family; Margaret in 1936, and [[Thomas Playford V|Thomas]] in 1945. All three of them attended private schools: Patricia attended the Presbyterian Girls College, becoming a teacher; and Margaret attended Methodist Ladies college, later training as a child psychiatrist. The sixth Thomas wanted to attend university, but, like a Playford before him, was rebuked and worked on the orchard. And again like a Playford before him, he became a minister of religion in his later life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =62}}</ref>

==Ascendence to office==
Among the organisations that Playford belonged to was the local branch of the [[Liberal Federation]], yet until the months preceding his eventual election, he never talked of holding political office. The Liberal Federation was considering a merger with the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] to avoid [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] retaining office during the [[Great Depression]]. [[Archie Cameron]], an old wartime friend of Playford's and a representative of the Country Party, influenced Playford to run for office when he heard of the merger. In 1932 the [[Liberal and Country League]] (LCL) was created, and Playford ran for the multi-member constituency of [[State electoral district of Murray|Murray]] in the election of 1933.

[[Image:Richard Butler jnr.jpg|[[Richard Layton Butler]], first LCL Premier of South Australia and Playford's predecessor.|200px|left|thumb]]
Along with the other LCL hopefuls, Playford journeyed around the electorate advocating his platform. The constituency had a considerable German element, descendants of refugees who had escaped persecution in the [[German Empire]]. Grateful for the past help of Playford's grandfather, they swung their strong support behind him and he was comfortably elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly]]. With a split in the Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with [[Richard Layton Butler]] as [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]].

For the next five years Playford was to remain a backbencher, and to involve himself relatively little in government matters. His speeches were short, but to the point, and, running against the norm, he often attacked the government itself when he saw fit. Around Playford, much activity was occurring. Legislation provided for the tools that he was to inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation.

The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the number of seats was reduced to 39 (from 46), and multi-member districts were abolished. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the March 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system was later christened the '[[Playmander]]', as a result of its benefit to Playford.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaensch |first=Dean |title=The Flinders History of South Australia: Political History |pages=260-261}}</ref>

Playford entered the cabinet in March 1938 as the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and held portfolios in Irrigation and Repatriation. He spent little time as a minister before becoming Premier; Butler abandoned the Premiership in November to seek election for the recently-vacated [[Australian House of Representatives]] [[Division of Wakefield]]. Elected unanimously by his peers, Playford became the 33rd Premier of South Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages=32-34}}</ref>

==Wartime development==
Playford became a wartime Premier in 1939 when Australia, as part of the [[British Empire]], became embroiled in [[World War II]]. Later in the war, cut off from traditional suppliers of manufactures, the country was forced to create its own. Armaments and munitions factories needed to be created to supply the war effort, and Playford was vociferous in advocating South Australia as the perfect location for these. It was far from the battlegrounds and had the most efficient labour force in the nation. Ammunition factories were built in the northern and western suburbs of [[Adelaide]], and construction on a shipyard began in [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]].

[[Salisbury, South Australia|Salisbury]], then a dormitory town to the north of Adelaide, became a defence centre; the shipyards at Whyalla began launching corvettes in 1941 just as Japan entered the war. All of these developments were done under Playford's watch, with most of the factories being built by the Department of Manpower and the [[South Australian Housing Trust]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =84-87}}</ref>

[[Image:Norrie Chifley Playford.jpg|240px|right|thumb|[[Ben Chifley]] (left), Labor Prime Minister, enjoyed a strong relationship with Playford (centre), despite their respective political allegiances.]]
In order for these developments to occur, Playford personally had to attend to the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted obstinate public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: [[Joseph Lyons|Lyons]], [[Earle Page|Page]], [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]], [[Arthur Fadden|Fadden]], [[John Curtin|Curtin]], [[Frank Forde|Forde]] and [[Ben Chifley|Chifley]]. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor rapport with his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =44-45}}</ref> 

To Playford's advantage there was usually a disproportionate amount of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly got more federal funds than it would have been allocated otherwise. This was to Menzies' chagrin: "Tom wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he does it all for South Australia, not for himself, so I forgive him."<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =133}}</ref>

During the war, two state elections were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, there was a significant decrease in the [[Independent (politician)|independent]] vote, and both the Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, yet it made no significant difference to the election result of 1944, despite an increase in voter turnout from 50% to 80%. Again Playford won, but with a one-seat majority, down one from 1941. In the following years, thanks to the malapportionment, he would build up a sizeable parliamentary majority.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaensch |first=Dean |title=The Flinders History of South Australia: Political History |pages =248-249}}</ref>

Power and water schemes were expanded to be able to cope with the industrial development occurring. South Australia's near-monopoly electricity supplier, the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem. They ran on coal that was shipped over from [[New South Wales]] (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by [[Communist Party of Australia|communist]]-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but even that began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from [[South Africa]] in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =105}}</ref>

==Industrialisation==
The AESC continued to snub the government. Playford advocated the use of [[Lignite|brown coal]] from the South Australian [[Leigh Creek, South Australia|Leigh Creek]] mine to avoid supply complications, and even made into law a bill encouraging its use. Shortly afterwards, the AESC responded by buying new boilers which would not be able to process that type of coal, only the more productive [[coal|black coal]]. With more conflicts ensuing, and even with the company slowly relenting, Playford did not stop his struggle. A [[Royal Commission]] in March 1945 was appointed to ascertain a solution between the two parties, and presented its report in August with a recommendation that the AESC be [[nationalisation|nationalised]]. By then at the head of the only conservative government in the nation, when Playford requested commonwealth funds to assist in the nationalisation of the AESC Prime Minister Chifley responded with glee and enthusiasm. On October 11, he presented a bill to [[Parliament of South Australia|Parliament]] to nationalise the AESC and create the [[Electricity Trust of South Australia]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =117}}</ref>

[[Image:Thomas Playford IV.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Sir Thomas Playford (left) receiving a [[barometer]] as a gift at the opening of the Birkenhead Terminal, [[Port Adelaide, South Australia|Port Adelaide]], 1950]]
Labor, astonished that such an action was to come from a Liberal Premier, resolutely supported the bill, guaranteeing it passage through the House of Assembly. However, the Legislative Council was dominated by economic conservatives, fierce adherents of free enterprise and opponents of what they considered to be undue government intervention in the economy. In the Council, where suffrage was reliant upon wage and property requirements, the ALP only held four seats out of twenty, and only five LCL members supported the nationalisation. Thus, on November 7, the bill failed to pass and it was not put to the Parliament again until 1946. On April 6, after months of campaigning on Playford's part, he managed to change the mind of MLC Jack Bice, and the bill passed. The Electricity Trust of South Australia was formed, and was to become a major aid to post-war industrialisation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =125}}</ref>

The privatisation of the AESC was the most prominent manifestation of Playford's economic pragmatism; although ideologically a free enterprise man like his colleagues, he saw ideology as secondary if it got in the way of his objectives. He had little time for those who objected to plans that were for the betterment of South Australia, despite these plans being contrary to particular interpretations of party ideology.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeansch |first=Dean |title=The Flinders History of South Australia: Political History |pages =252}}</ref>

During the post-war boom, the methods used to set up business in South Australia were unique. Playford's government would charge little to no business tax, supply cheap electricity, land and water, and have the Housing Trust build the factories and workers' homes. Consumer goods and automotive factories were created in the northern and western suburbs of Adelaide; mining, steel and shipbuilding industries appeared in the 'Iron Triangle' towns of [[Whyalla, South Australia|Whyalla]], [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]] and [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]]. Prices and wages were kept relatively low to enable continued investment. The government initiatives managed to overcome the large logistic burden, as Adelaide and South Australia were far from the markets where the goods would be sold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeansch |first=Dean |title=The Flinders History of South Australia: Political History |pages =250-251}}</ref>

Many of the methods that Playford used were described by economic conservatives as 'socialism'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader [[Mick O'Halloran]] would dine with Playford on a weekly basis to discuss the development of the state. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that "I wouldn't want to Premier even If I could be. Tom Playford can often do more for my own voters than I could if I were in his shoes."<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =218}}</ref> This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until [[Don Dunstan]]'s prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.

Large projects were commenced. The city of [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]] was built by the Housing Trust in Adelaide's north, for the production of [[General Motors|GM]] [[Holden]] motor vehicles. Populated mainly by working class [[English people|English]] migrants, it was, before its eventual economic and social decline, a model for city planning. These ventures, despite being built by the public sector, were not done in opposition to private enterprise; mainline roads and railways would be built and modified to the wishes and needs of business. [[Main North Road]], for example, had its alignment changed at the request of industry.

When Playford left office in 1965, South Australia's population had doubled from 600,000 in the late 1930s to 1.1 million, the highest proportionate rate among the [[States and territories of Australia|states]]. The economy had done likewise, and personal wealth had increased at the same rate, second only to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =38}}</ref>

==Don Dunstan==
In 1953, the young lawyer, [[Don Dunstan]], was elected to the House of Assembly as the Labor member for [[Electoral district of Norwood|Norwood]], ousting the LCL incumbent. Playford had landed unexpectedly in his role as the undisputed leader of his party, while Dunstan was, from the start of his parliamentary career, a stand out among his own ranks. Dunstan had proved himself an excellent orator in parliament, and had gained notoriety as the loudest opposition voice against the death penalty being imposed upon [[Max Stuart]], an [[Indigenous Australian|Aborigine]] convicted for the rape and murder of a child. Dunstan and Playford were each others' principle antagonists.

[[Image:Playford 1956.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Sir Thomas at work in his office, 1956.]]
Playford, used to cooperating with Labor leaders more than attacking them, sensed Dunstan's promise, and predicting that one day Dunstan would be at the helm, attempted to establish bonds. So, after a late session of parliament at night, Playford would give Dunstan a lift home in his car. As Dunstan's home was situated on George Street, [[Norwood, South Australia|Norwood]], it was only a small deviance from Playford's normal route to his home in Norton Summit. The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]], Dunstan a [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]]), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =316-317}}</ref>

To face an opposition that was becoming uncooperative was not what Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle. Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament, Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills, and ensure bipartisan support in the House of Assembly for them; there was little discordance on matters. The belligerents were previously only rural independent members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =98-99}}</ref>

Even while the economic boom continued, the LCL vote gradually declined from 1950, and it relied on favourable preferences from minor parties and independents and the malapportioned electoral system in order to win. It did, however, win all elections, barring 1953, on a two-party-preferred basis until 1962.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/pastelec.htm Past Elections, Australian Broadcasting Corporation] Accessed January 03 2007</ref> Labor had begun to combat the Playmander by directing its efforts at individual seats, and abandoning a statewide campaign. Slowly, seats began to whittle away: Norwood was won in 1953; West Torrens, Murray, Miilicent and Frome in 1956; and Mt Gambier and Wallaroo in 1957-8 by-elections. Playford's dominance over the party and his ignorance of the wishes of its broad membership base brought about a degree of disillusionment, and the party machine began to decay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blewett |first=Neal |title=Playford to Dunstan: The Politics of Transition |pages=30-31}}</ref>

During this period, Prime Minister Menzies recommended that Playford be bestowed with a form of [[British honours system|honours]]. Playford's wish was to be made a [[Privy council|privy councillor]], yet, while entirely possible, if granted it would lead to demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], and Playford himself did initially, but under the influence of Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =173}}</ref>

==Fall from power==
Playford was confronted with an economic recession when he went into the election of 1962. Earlier, in late 1961, the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|Country]] coalition had suffered a large swing against them, reducing their majority to two. In the 1962 state election, the Labor Party gained 54.3% of the two-party-preferred vote and 19 seats, while the LCL managed only 18. The balance of power was held by two independents, and they swung their support behind Playford and allowed his government to continue for another term. Nonetheless, much media fanfare was made of the result, and of the detrimental effects of the 'Playmander'. Opposition leader [[Frank Walsh]] declared the result "a travesty of electoral injustice".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =326}}</ref>

While the political situation was becoming increasingly untenable, Playford himself continued with his job of building the state. Plans for Adelaide's future development, including a [[Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study|freeway system]], were commissioned; the state's population hit in the one million mark in 1963; and the [[Port Stanvac, South Australia|Port Stanvac]] [[oil refinery]] was completed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =329}}</ref>

[[Image:Parliament house sa.jpg|left|240px|thumb|[[Parliament House, Adelaide|Parliament House]] (pictured here during the 1950s) was colloquially known as 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' during the Playford era.]]
Electoral legislation remained unchanged. Labor introduced bills for reform, but these were defeated in both houses of Parliament. Playford introduced his own electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on independent [[Tom Stott]] in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a [[Pair (parliamentary convention)|pair]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blewett |first=Neal |title=Playford to Dunstan: The Politics of Transition |pages=30}}</ref>

The conservatism of the Liberal and Country League did not keep up with the modern-day situation. There was dissatisfaction with the restrictive drinking laws; environmentalists campaigned for more natural parks and more 'green' practices; police powers stood strong, 'no loitering' legislation remained in place; gambling was almost completely restricted. The constituents who loudly demanded changes were mostly immigrants and their offspring, used to more libertarian conditions in their countries of origin. Their homes, usually built by the Housing Trust, sprawled into 'rural' electoral districts that were controlled by the League. Labor pledged to introduce social legislation to meet their demands; Playford, who did not drink, smoke or gamble, had no interest in doing so. His own candidates knew that the election of 1965 would be unwinnable if Playford did not budge. The economy was still going strong and incomes were still increasing, so the Premier did not change his position on social reform.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =329-333}}</ref>

Playford went into the election of 1965 confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, March 6, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power for the first time in 35 years. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but cried when he told his family of it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =334-335}}</ref>

==Retirement==
After the loss, Playford continued to lead the LCL opposition for a further one and a half years until he relinquished the leadership. In the subsequent ballot, [[Steele Hall]], a small farmer like Playford, won and led the LCL to victory at the following election. Playford retired from politics at the same time, presumably for reasons of age, but stated that "I couldn't cope with the change in the attitudes of some MPs, even some in the highest places... I found I could no longer cope with the change... I can't handle a liar who doesn't turn a hair while he's lying... I decided I couldn't take it any longer".<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =219-220}}</ref>

Playford retired from Parliament with a pension of $72 a week; he had resisted giving higher pensions to Ministers or longer-serving MPs throughout his tenure. He returned to his orchard at Norton Summit, and took a continued interest in South Australian politics, but did not typically raise his opinions publicly; he was still consulted in private by Liberals up until his death, however. His closeness to Labor figures did not end either, offering advice to their new South Australian ministers, and assisting in a memorial to the former Labor Prime Minister [[John Curtin]]. In 1977, when Don Dunstan celebrated his 50th birthday party, Playford was the only Liberal invited. There he socialised with former and future Labor Prime Ministers [[Gough Whitlam]] and [[Bob Hawke]], Dunstan, and other Laborites.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =319-320}}</ref>

He served on the boards of the [[Electricity Trust of South Australia|Electricity Trust]] and the [[South Australian Housing Trust|Housing Trust]], among others. Here, unused to not being in absolute control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cockburn |first=Stewart |title=Playford: Benevolent Despot |pages =342-344}}</ref>

Playford had begun experiencing serious health problems since his first heart attack in June 1971, and underwent treatment and procedures for ten years. On June 16, 1981, he experienced a massive heart attack and died. Two days later his memorial service was held at the [[Flinders Street Baptist Church]]. The funeral procession carried his coffin from the city, along Magill and Old Norton Summit Roads where thousands turned out to pay their respects, to the Norton Summit cemetery where his forebears had been buried. There his gravestone was emblazoned with a simple phrase: 'a good man who did good things'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crocker |first=Walter |title=Sir Thomas Playford: A Portrait |pages =179}}</ref>
