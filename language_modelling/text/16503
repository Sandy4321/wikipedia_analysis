As Bush's brother, [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]], sought the governorship of Florida, Bush declared his candidacy for the 1994 Texas [[Governor#United States|gubernatorial]] election.

====Primary====
In June 1999, while Governor of Texas, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States. With no [[incumbent]] running, Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting of [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Robert C. Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[Compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]]. He campaigned on a platform that included increasing the size of the [[Military of the United States|United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.<ref name="msn"/> By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.<ref name="msn"/>

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], but, although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19% and lost that primary. However, the Bush campaign regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]], which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' made history for its negativity; ''The New York Times'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].<ref name="anatomy">{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Richard H.|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/|title=The anatomy of a smear campaign|publisher=''The Boston Globe''|date=March 21, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hook|first=Janet|coauthor=Michael Finnegan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17|title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=March 17, 2007|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Steinhauer|first=Jennifer |url=http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&OP=6078ead7Q2FQ7CF0)Q7C@Q25Q2ADiQ25Q25Q3EHQ7CHXX.Q7CRXQ7CRrQ7CQ2BDQ7CQ7DQ25Q3CBQ3EBQ2ADQ7CRrkQ2AQ2AQ3FBQ2FQ22_Q3EkQ3C |format=Registration required|title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

====General election====
On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers by asking [[Dick Cheney]], a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], to be his [[running mate]]. Cheney was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after, Cheney was officially nominated by the Republican Party at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.<ref name="msn"/> Bush's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[gun politics|gun control]] and taxation.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sack, Kevin and Toner, Robin|date=August 13, 2000|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html|title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

When the election returns came in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].<ref name="msn"/> The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,<ref name="msn"/> and claimed Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the [[war on terrorism]].

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote (50.7% to his opponent's 48.3%).<ref name="16 years">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16|title=And now... four more years|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=November 4, 2004|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The previous President to win an absolute majority of the popular vote had been Bush's father in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1928|election in 1928]] that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. Bush's 2.5% margin of victory was the narrowest ever for a victorious incumbent President, breaking [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 3.1% margin of victory against [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|election of 1916]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Turow|first=Scott|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26059-2004Dec25.html|title=A Dominant GOP?

====Education and health====
President Bush undertook a number of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Committee on Appropriations]]&nbsp;<U+2014>Democratic Staff|title=President Bush and House Republicans Undermine Life Saving Health Research|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=September 12, 2006|accessdate=October 11, 2006}}</ref>

[[File:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|thumb|left|Bush signs the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] into law, January 2002]]

One of the administration's early major initiatives was the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income [[schools]].

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a Medicare drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]], resulted in "the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years;" the bill's costs approached $7 trillion.<ref>Greenburg, Jan Crawford, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, 2007, Penguin Books, p. 274</ref> In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress.

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.org/conf2004/summary-medicare-act-2003.htm|title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2008|publisher=Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc.|year=2004}}</ref> The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement.

====Environmental and energy policies====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the [[United Nations]] Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80% of the world's population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html|title=Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary|date=March 13, 2001}}</ref> and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm|title=Summary of the Kyoto Report<U+2014>Assessment of Economic Impacts|publisher=Energy Information Administration|date=July 16, 2002}}</ref>  He also cited that the Senate had voted 95<U+2013>0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.

In 2002, Bush announced the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],<ref name="EXsummary">{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html|title=Executive Summary<U+2014>The Clear Skies Initiative|publisher=The White House|date=February 14, 2002|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[emissions trading]] programs.

In 2006, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest marine reserve to date. The [[Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&nbsp;million acres (340,000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/|title=Bush creates world<U+2019>s biggest ocean preserve|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> The move was hailed by conservationists for "its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html|title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World<U+2019>s Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii|publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit [[US Dollar|$]]2&nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, "Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive."  He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the [[United Nations]], to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of [[greenhouse gas]]es; he stated, "This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,23125585-401,00.html|title=State of the Union:Bush fights for spotlight|author=Reuters/AFP|date=January 29, 2008}}</ref>

[[Hurricane Katrina]], which was one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, struck early in Bush<U+2019>s second term.

Although Congressional investigations have focused on whether the Justice Department and the [[Executive Office of the President|White House]] were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/house-judiciary-panel-files-civil.php|title=House judiciary panel files civil lawsuit to enforce Miers, Bolten subpoenas|accessdate=May 30, 2008|date=March 10, 2008|author=Porter, Patrick|publisher=Jurist Legal News and Research}}</ref> On July 31, 2008, a [[United States district court]] judge ruled that President Bush's top advisers are not immune from Congressional subpoenas.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-07-31-2444639400_x.htm Federal judge rules Bush's aides can be subpoenaed, USA Today, July 31, 2008]</ref>

In August 2009, Karl Rove and Harriet Miers testified before the House Judiciary Committee.

In February 2001, U.S. and British warplanes struck air command centers in Iraq, including targets around Bagdad, in what Bush described as necessary to respond to Iraqi provocation.  News analysis of the decision by Bush approving the air strikes against Iraq beyond the <U+2018>no fly zone<U+2019> suggested that Bush is sending a message not only for Iraq but for the rest of the world that he is approaching the role of world leader without timidity.<ref>New York Times, February 17, 2001, p. 1</ref>

During his Presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] platform included support for a stronger economic and political relationship with [[Latin America]], especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in "[[nation-building]]" and other small-scale military engagements.  The administration pursued a [[national missile defense]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html|title=President Bush Speech on Missile Defense|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|date=May 1, 2001|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>  In response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], President Bush launched the [[War on Terrorism]], in which the United States military and an international coalition [[Invasions of Afghanistan#American invasion|invaded Afghanistan]].

Those invasions led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan and the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq as well as the [[Casualties of the Iraq War|deaths of many Iraqis]], with surveys indicating between [[ORB survey of Iraq War casualties|four hundred thousand to over one million dead]], excluding the tens of thousands of civilians in Afghanistan.<ref name=update>[http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=88 Update on Iraqi Casualty Data] by Opinion Research Business, January 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.opinion.co.uk/Newsroom_details.aspx?NewsId=78 "More than 1,000,000 Iraqis murdered"].

Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]].

In March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of U.S. policy.<ref>http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm,</ref> The visit focused particularly in areas of [[nuclear energy]] and counter-terrorism cooperation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html|title=U.S.-India Joint Statement|date=March 2, 2006|publisher=The White House|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.<ref>http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29825.html</ref> 

Midway through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301017.html|title=Retreat From the Freedom Agenda|accessdate=September 1, 2008|last=Diehl|first=Jackson|date=April 24, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

That evening, he addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]], promising a strong response to the attacks but emphasizing the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims.  On September 14, he visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]], meeting with [[Mayor of New York City|Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] and firefighters, police officers, and volunteers.

Beginning with his January 29, 2002, State of the Union address, Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an "[[axis of evil]]" allied with terrorists and posing "a grave and growing danger" to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref name=sotu2002 />  In the latter half of 2002, CIA [[National Intelligence Estimate|reports]] contained assertions of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi [[biological warfare|biological]] and [[chemical warfare|chemical weapons]], and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd/Iraq_Oct_2002.htm|title=Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs|accessdate=|year=2002|month=October|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/index.htm|title=CIA Whites Out Controversial Estimate on Iraq Weapons|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=July 9, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>  Claims that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.<ref>Judis, John B. and Ackerman, Spencer, <U+201C>The Selling of the Iraq War<U+201D>, ''[[The New Republic]]'', June 2003.</ref><ref>Hersh, Seymour M., "The Stovepipe", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 27, 2003.</ref>

In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi [[disarmament]] mandates, precipitating a [[Iraq disarmament crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. In November 2002, Hans Blix and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were forced to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.<ref>{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm|title=U.S. advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=March 17, 2003|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref> The U.S. initially sought a [[UN Security Council]] resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/chapterVII.htm|title=Enforcement Measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|accessdate=September 1, 2008|author=[[United Nations]]|date=February 13, 2003|work=[[United Nations Charter]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}</ref>

On January 10, 2007, Bush addressed the nation from the [[Oval Office]] regarding the situation in Iraq.  In [[s:Presidential Speech Regarding Iraq, January 10, 2007|his speech]] he announced a [[Iraq troop surge of 2007|surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq]], as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and [[US Dollar|$]]1.2&nbsp;billion for these programs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16558652/page/1/|title=Admitting strategy error, Bush adds Iraq troops|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=January 11, 2007}}</ref>  On May 1, 2007, Bush used his [[veto]] for only the second time in his presidency, rejecting a congressional bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sheryl Gay |last=Stolberg |authorlink= |coauthors=Zeleny, Jeff |title=Bush Vetoes Bill Tying Iraq Funds to Exit |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/washington/02policy.html |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate= }}</ref>  Five years after the invasion, Bush called the debate over the conflict "understandable" but insisted that a continued U.S. presence there is crucial.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/18/bush.iraq/index.html Bush on anniversary: War in Iraq must go on], ''CNN'', March 19, 2008.</ref>

====Surveillance====
Following the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing the [[President's Surveillance Program]] which included allowing the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Briefing by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and General Michael Hayden|publisher=The White House|date=December 19, 2005|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051219-1.html|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>  (As of 2009, the other provisions of program remained highly classified.<ref name=IG>{{cite report |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/17267628/Unclassified-Report-on-the-Presidents-Surveillance-Program|title=Unclassified Report on the President<U+2019>s Surveillance Program|format=Scribd |author=Inspectors General of the DoD, DOJ, CIA, NSA, and ODN |date=July 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 11, 2009|quote=The specific intelligence activities that were permitted by the Presidential Authorizations remain highly classified, except that beginning in December 2005 the President and other Administration officials acknowledged that these activities included the interception without a court order of certain international communications where there is "a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al-Qa'ida, affiliated with al-Qa'ida, or a member of an organization affiliated with al-Qa'ida."}}</ref>)  Once the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]] questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].<ref>U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities. {{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/nsa/dojnsa11906wp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President|date=January 19, 2006}}</ref>  The program proved to be [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|controversial]], as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the [[American Bar Association]], claimed it was illegal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gonzales defends wiretaps amid protest|work=CNN|date=January 26, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/24/nsa.strategy/index.html|accessdate=September 2, 2007}}; {{cite news|title=Lawyers Group Criticizes Surveillance Program|work=The Washington Post|date=February 14, 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/13/AR2006021302006.html|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>  In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]] was unconstitutional,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/01/AR2006090101410.html|title=Judge Asked to Suspend Ruling Against Wiretaps|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=February 9, 2006|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked [[standing (law)|standing]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Court dismisses lawsuit on spying program|publisher=Reuters|date=July 6, 2007|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0642400020070706|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}</ref>  On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=Alberto|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/AG_letter_to_Senate_leaders_regarding_FISC_decision_and_conclusion_of_Terrorist_Surveillance_Program|title=Letter from the AG to the Senate leaders|date=January 17, 2007|work=Wikisource|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}</ref>

====Supreme Court====
{{Main|George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates}}
Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John G. Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position; after facing significant opposition, she asked that her name be withdrawn on October 27. Four days later, on October 31, Bush nominated federal appellate judge [[Samuel Alito]] for the position and he was confirmed as the 110th Supreme Court Justice on January 31, 2006.

====Other courts====
