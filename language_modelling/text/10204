==Commercial Area==
Bankstown's central business district is clustered around [[Bankstown railway station, Sydney|Bankstown Railway Station]].

==History==
Prior to [[European]] [[settlement]], Cumberland Plains [[Woodland]] occupied much of the area.[[Turpentine]] [[ironbark]] [[forest]] covered much of what is now Bankstown.

In [[1795]] [[Matthew Flinders]] and [[George Bass]] explored up the [[George's River]] for about 20 miles beyond what had been previously surveyed, and reported favourably to [[John Hunter (New South Wales)|Governor Hunter]] of the land on its banks.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=12929|name=A Voyage to Terra Australis by Matthew Flinders}}</ref>  Hunter examined the country himself, and established one of the pioneer colonies there, called Bank's Town, today written as one word Bankstown.<ref>{{gutenberg|no=7304|name=The Life of Captain Matthew Flinders, by Ernest Scott}}</ref>

Hunter named it in honour of botanist [[Sir Joseph Banks]], who travelled to Australia with [[Captain James Cook]] in [[1770]].  The area of first European settlement along the river has been partially preserved as part of the [[Mirrumbeena Regional Reserve]]. Bankstown also includes large areas of the [[Georges River National Park]].

One hundred years after its naming, Bankstown was proclaimed a municipal district on 9 September 1895. At this time there was a feeling of impending growth which was further strengthened by the promise of increased railway extensions. Municipalities already constituted became ambitious and in 1894, both Enfield and Auburn Councils announced their intention to absorb Bankstown as part of their own municipalities. However, a petition was organised and signed by 300 residents resulting in Bankstown retaining its individual status. And on 9 September 1895 it was proclaimed a municipal district. The first election was held on 2 November 1895. With 884 electors on the roll, 112 people voted to cast a total of 213 votes. Each ratepayer was entitled to 1.4 votes according to the assessed value of his property

On 27 May 1980, during a visit by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]], Bankstown was accorded city status.

==Geology==
Bankstown is situated in the [[Cumberland County, New South Wales|Cumberland Plains]] region and is dominated by [[Bringelly]] [[Shale]] in the [[north]] and [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]] [[shale]] in the [[south]]. The [[area]] south of Bankstown by [[Georges River]] is dominated by Hawkesbury [[sandstone]] where the [[soil]] tends to be [[shallow]], [[sand]]y and [[infertile]].
