{{nihongo|'''Masaharu Funaki'''|<U+8239><U+6728> <U+512A><U+6CBB>|Funaki Masaharu}}, is a Japanese [[mixed martial artist]] and [[professional wrestler]], who has previously wrestled in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]], [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]], PWFG, as well as the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Japan)|UWF]]. He is also the co-founder of [[Pancrase]], one of the first mixed martial arts organizations and non-rehearsed [[shoot wrestling]] promotions (following five years after the inception of [[Shooto]] but predating America's [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]). Funaki was also [[Pancrase]]'s biggest star; [[Josh Barnett]] described him as the "symbol of Japan", [[Frank Shamrock]] labeled Funaki "the golden boy" of Pancrase, and [[Guy Mezger]] called Funaki "hands down the smartest and most skilled fighter in [[Pancrase]] next to [[Ken Shamrock]]".<ref>Todd Martin: The overlooked origins of mixed martial arts. Contributor to CBS Sports</ref><ref>http://sfuk.tripod.com/interviews_01/mezger_1.html</ref>

Not only the organization's co-founder, Funaki was also one of [[Pancrase]]'s most successful fighters to date, scoring submission victories over numerous MMA champions such as [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Frank Shamrock]], [[Guy Mezger]], [[Yuki Kondo]], [[Minoru Suzuki]] and [[Bas Rutten]] through the course of his 50-fight career. He is the only fighter in mixed martial arts to hold wins over both Shamrock brothers and Bas Rutten, and was the first man to win the [[List of Pancrase champions#Openweight Championship|King of Pancrase]] title twice.

Funaki is widely considered to be one of the greatest Japanese fighters in [[mixed martial arts]] history.<ref>http://www.sherdog.com/stats/powerratings/upr-fighter-alltime</ref> [[Sherdog.com]] ranked him as the #1 mixed martial artist in the world for the years 1996 and 1997, and also had him ranked as a top 4 [[pound for pound]] fighter from 1993 to 1998.<ref>Sherdog.com Power Ratings, 1993-1998</ref>

==Early life==
The son of a movie theater owner, Funaki was exposed to martial arts films at an early age. He idolized [[Bruce Lee]] above all others, but also eagerly watched the films of [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Sonny Chiba]]. Though his father would ultimately abandon young Funaki and his family, the exposure to such films influenced him greatly.{{Or|date=January 2010}}

==Pro wrestling career==

===New Japan Pro Wrestling (1985-1989)===
Instead of entering high school, he applied to the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] Dojo. He was in the same class as [[Puroresu]] legends [[Keiichi Yamada]] (better known as [[Jushin Liger]]), [[Shinya Hashimoto]], [[Minoru Suzuki]], and [[Masahiro Chono]]. The Canadian grappler [[Chris Benoit]], who went on to fame in the [[WWE]], was also a classmate of his.

The New Japan Dojo had a reputation for being particularly harsh on its trainees, both mentally and physically, with the intent of only graduating the very best of each class. However, Funaki stunned the New Japan trainers with his athleticism, timing and natural talent for [[submission grappling]]. Along with the former Olympic alternate [[Minoru Suzuki]], Funaki formed a strong bond with the dojo's head grappling instructor, [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]]. Funaki debuted as a Jr. Heavyweight at the age of 15; it was a record for the youngest debut in NJPW.

After debuting for New Japan with a time-limit draw against fellow New Japan Dojo graduate [[Chris Benoit]], Funaki was not given much of a chance to shine, as the Jr. Heavyweight division was in a transition period. And as such, the owner, Antonio Inoki, decided to shift the focus towards his heavyweight division which dominated the cards. He did, however have many stellar matches with [[Naoki Sano]] & [[Keiichi Yamada]] (who would later become Jushin Liger) & was the first person to take the [[Shooting Star Press]] from Yamada. In 1988, he wrestled an excursion in Europe, competing in [[Catch Wrestling Association]] in Austria and Germany and for [[All Star Promotions]] in England.

When New Japan top draw [[Akira Maeda]] became so frustrated with backstage politics that he shoot kicked [[Riki Choshu]] and broke his eye socket, he was fired after refusing to go on an excursion to Mexico, and left to form Newborn UWF. Funaki, seeing an opportunity to shine and showcase what he could do, wanted to follow. And Maeda negotiated the acquisition of his, along with friend Suzuki and mentor [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]]'s contracts for an undisclosed amount of money.

===Newborn UWF and Pro Wrestling Fujiwara Gumi (1989-1993)===
With his flashy moves and movie star good looks, Funaki became a top draw and an excellent nemesis to [[Akira Maeda]], and their matches had many fast paced strikes & exciting slams. When Newborn UWF folded in December 1990, Funaki decided to sign with mentor Fujiwara's new "'''Fujiwara Gumi'''" promotion. Funaki left Fujiwara Gumi in 1993 to form the mixed martial arts promotion [[Pancrase]].

==Mixed martial arts career==

===Pancrase (1993-2000)===
Funaki's MMA career began when he founded [[Pancrase]] along with [[Minoru Suzuki]]. Pancrase became immensely popular and paved the way for other mixed martial arts organizations to make their way in Japan, including [[Pride Fighting Championships]]. Funaki went on to become one of the greatest fighters in Pancrase history, defeating other MMA legends such as [[Bas Rutten]], [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Frank Shamrock]], [[Minoru Suzuki]], and [[Guy Mezger]].

Funaki is known as a master of [[catch wrestling]]. Funaki was so skilled that he often took other Pancrase fighters, including [[Bas Rutten]], [[Frank Shamrock]] and [[Ken Shamrock]], under his wing in order to increase his competition. Frank Shamrock said, "Funaki was like a mad scientist. He took the idea of submissions to an even higher level than the rest of the Japanese contingent. He had this insatiable desire to learn more and push his body harder. And as an entertainer he understood the need to entertain."<ref name="kocosports.com">http://www.kocosports.com/absolutenm/anmviewer.asp?a=18494&z=60</ref>

This realization for the need to entertain often resulted in Funaki (along [[Minoru Suzuki]]) "carrying" some of their opponents during fights. In essence, in order to entertain the crowd, Funaki and Suzuki would occasionally give their opponents opportunities to create drama before finally finishing them off. Josh Barnett said, "when you're that good, you can have a guy thinking he's doing so much better than he expected and have no idea that they're just letting you last like a cat playing with a mouse."<ref name="kocosports.com"/> Frank Shamrock added, "I know for a fact those guys (Funaki and Suzuki) were light years ahead of everyone else, and they were so good that they would go towards entertainment before they finished a match."<ref name="kocosports.com"/>

However, this did backfire on Funaki on at least one occasion. In a match against [[Jason DeLucia]], Funaki allowed Delucia to catch him in a kneebar in order to create drama and planned on using a rope escape once Delucia had the submission locked in. Unfortunately, Funaki mistakenly allowed himself to get too far from the ropes and was forced to tap out. This concern for entertainment helped the young sport of [[mixed martial arts]] to thrive and grow in Japan. [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] would similarly play around with inferior opponents years later.

Funaki retired from Pancrase after a win over Tony Petarra in September 1999 due to accumulated injuries and, according to fellow Pancrase fighter and friend [[Bas Rutten]], being burnt out from the hectic Pancrase schedule.

===Masakatsu Funaki vs. Rickson Gracie===

Despite Funaki's body being very broken down from injuries, he returned for a fight against the legendary [[Rickson Gracie]] at Colosseum 2000 held at the [[Tokyo Dome]]. The show was almost canceled due to Rickson trying to change the rules to make knees and strikes to the head illegal, but the problems were overcome and the show continued.<ref>http://www.quebrada.net/news/News20001.html</ref> The event was broadcast to 30 million TV Tokyo viewers. While there was no championship title at stake, Funaki had a lot on the line in his fight against Gracie; if Funaki were to beat the legendary Rickson Gracie he would become a "godlike" figure in Japan and enjoy immense popularity and fame.

Funaki walked to the ring in [[samurai]] attire with a [[samurai sword]] which garnered a roaring excitement from the Japanese announcers and crowd. Funaki scored the first takedown of the bout. However, a kick from Gracie blew out his knee. Ultimately, he was taken down and defeated by a [[rear-naked choke]]. Funaki refused to submit to the hold, passing out before the referee intervened. After the fight, Funaki stated that he thought he was going to die from the choke.

Funaki then retired from [[mixed martial arts]] competition. He had a retirement ceremony in [[Pancrase]] in late 2000 in which many of his past mentors and training partners emotionally and tearfully embraced the legendary Funaki.

===K-1 and Dream (2007-2008)===
On 12/31/2007, Funaki came out of retirement to fight fellow MMA legend [[Kazushi Sakuraba]] at the K-1 Dynamite event at Kyocera Dome Osaka. Although both fighters were significantly past their primes, this matchup was intriguing because it was a bout between arguably the two greatest Japanese fighters in mixed martial arts history.

After exchanging professional wrestling-inspired entrances, the submission specialists traded strikes. Funaki's arsenal of punches and kicks appeared to be quicker and more powerful, but Sakuraba was able to sneak in a double-leg take down after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. On the ground, Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening it up to spin for a knee-bar. For a moment, Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba's leg only to be thwarted by a combination of Sakuraba's submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes, which blocked Funaki from rolling with the hold. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki's back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault the still-prone Funaki's legs with a series of kicks. Funaki answered with a kick of his own, blackening Sakuraba's eye and cutting his face. Sakuraba returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him. However, Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.

Funaki signed a contract with [[Fighting and Entertainment Group|FEG]]'s MMA promotion, [[DREAM (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]]. On April 28, 2008, Funaki participated in DREAM's first ever Middle-weight Grand Prix. Funaki was matched against another legendary [[Japan]]ese fighter [[Kiyoshi Tamura]] at the opening round of the [[DREAM.2]] Middleweight Grandprix 2008 in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], [[Japan]]. After a hard opening exchange between the two, Funaki was staggered by a punch and pulled guard on Tamura, from where he was pounded to an eventual TKO at 0:57 of Round 1. This was his first (T)KO stoppage loss since September 14, 1998, when he was knocked out with a body blow by [[Semmy Schilt]]. Funaki was eliminated from the Middle-weight Grand Prix.

After losing twice in a row since Funaki's comeback to the MMA ring, Funaki was determined to prove that he was still a worthy competitor of the sport and participated again in the [[DREAM.6]] Middleweight Grandprix 2008 Final round event that took place on September 23, 2008 at the [[Saitama Super Arena]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], [[Japan]]. Funaki was matched with one of his former Pancrase students, fan favorite "Minowaman" [[Ikuhisa Minowa]]. Prior to the bout, Funaki suggested that if this fight was going be equivalent to a ritual suicide, there was none he found more worthy than Minowa to assist him in carrying it out.

At the opening seconds of the first round of the match, Funaki came at his former charge with a series of kicks, practically forcing Minowa to catch one of the kicks. The former two-time King of Pancrase capitalized immediately, leaping directly into a heel-hook. Minowa escaped the hold, but Funaki maintained control of his leg and immediately attacked with a heel-hook from the cross-body position, forcing his protege to tap at 52 seconds of the first round.

===RINGS (2012)===
Masakatsu Funaki was scheduled to face Russian MMA legend Magomedkhan "Volk Han" Amanulayevich Gamzatkhanov in a fight resembling the Pancrase Hybrid Wrestler format. The fight went the distance with a draw between the two MMA legends, in which Volk Han announced his retirement afterwards.

==Return to pro wrestling==

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2009<U+2013>2013)===
In August 2007, Funaki and [[Keiji Mutoh]] discussed the possibility of Funaki returning to regular professional wrestling in Mutoh's company, [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]. On August 31, 2009, Funaki signed a one year contract with All Japan, following a tag team victory with Mutoh against [[Minoru Suzuki]] and [[Masahiro Chono]].

On January 3, 2010, Funaki and Mutoh won the [[AJPW Unified World Tag Team Championship|All Japan Double Cup]] tag team title from Suzuki and [[Taiyo Kea]]. On March 21, Funaki defeated Suzuki in a cage match at All Japan's Sumo Hall show.

On January 4, 2012, Funaki made a special appearance for New Japan at [[January 4 Dome Show#Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome|Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome]], where he teamed with [[Masayuki Kono]] to defeat the [[Seigigun]] of [[Yuji Nagata]] and [[Wataru Inoue]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/match/detail_result.php?e=470|title=NJPW 40th anniversary Tour. <U+30EC><U+30C3><U+30B9><U+30EB><U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0><U+2165> in <U+6771><U+4EAC><U+30C9><U+30FC><U+30E0>|accessdate=2012-01-04|work=[[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> During the match, Nagata broke Funaki's [[orbital bone]], sidelining him from in-ring action for an estimated six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/news/detail.php?id=948|title=<U+8239><U+6728><U+8AA0><U+52DD><U+9078><U+624B><U+306E><U+691C><U+67FB><U+7D50><U+679C><U+306E><U+3054><U+5831><U+544A>|date=2012-01-06|accessdate=2012-01-09|work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> Funaki returned to the ring on June 17, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=272|title=40th Anniversary year Cross Over 2012|work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]|accessdate=2012-06-17|language=Japanese}}</ref> On July 29, he defeated the man who had injured him, Yuji Nagata, in a grudge match to become the number one contender to the [[AJPW Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=283|title=40th Anniversary Year 2012 Junior Hyper League|accessdate=2012-07-29|work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> On August 26 he defeated [[Jun Akiyama]] in a match that lasted less than five minutes to become the 45th Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion.<ref name=TripleCrown>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=296|title=40th Anniversary Year Summer Impact 2012|accessdate=2012-08-26|work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]|language=Japanese}}</ref> He lost the title to [[Kohei Suwama|Suwama]] on March 17, 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=344 | title = 2013 <U+30D7><U+30ED><U+30EC><U+30B9>Love in <U+4E21><U+56FD><U+FF5E>Basic&Dynamic<U+FF5E> | accessdate=2013-03-17 | work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> In June 2013, Funaki announced his resignation from All Japan in the aftermath of Nobuo Shiraishi taking over as the new president and Keiji Mutoh leaving the promotion.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130616-00000014-dal | title = <U+8239><U+6728><U+3001><U+5168><U+65E5><U+672C><U+96E2><U+8131><U+3078><U+2026><U+300C><U+3042><U+3046><U+3093><U+306E><U+547C><U+5438><U+300D><U+6B66><U+85E4><U+3068><U+5408><U+6D41><U+304B> | date=2013-06-16 | accessdate=2013-06-16 | work=Sports Navi | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> Funaki's final match for the promotion took place on June 30 and saw him and his Stack of Arms partners [[Koji Kanemoto]] and Masayuki Kono, who were also leaving All Japan, lose to [[Akebono Tar<U+014D>|Akebono]], [[Osamu Nishimura]] and [[Ryota Hama]] in a six-man tag team match.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.all-japan.co.jp/schedule/tour03.php?taikai_id=387 | title = 2013 <U+30D7><U+30ED><U+30EC><U+30B9>Love in <U+4E21><U+56FD><U+FF5E>an abiding belief<U+FF5E> | accessdate=2013-06-30 | work=[[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>
