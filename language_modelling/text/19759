'''Attachment theory''' is a [[psychological]], [[evolution]]ary and [[Ethology|ethological]] theory concerning [[interpersonal relationship|relationships between humans]]. The most important tenet of attachment theory is that a young child needs to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for social and emotional development to occur normally. The theory was formulated by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst [[John Bowlby]].<ref name="Cassidy"/> 

Within attachment theory, infant behaviour associated with attachment is primarily the seeking of [[Wikt:proximity|proximity]] to an attachment figure in stressful situations. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with them, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the latter part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment; these, in turn, lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.<ref name="Bretherton/Mul">{{cite encyclopedia|author= Bretherton I, Munholland KA|title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|editor= Cassidy J, Shaver PR|location=New York|publisher= Guilford Press|isbn= 1572300876|pages=89<U+2013>114}}</ref> Separation anxiety or grief following the loss of an attachment figure is considered to be a normal and adaptive response for an attached infant. These behaviours may have evolved because they increase the probability of survival of the child.<ref>Prior and Glaser p. 17.</ref>

Research by [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] [[Mary Ainsworth]] in the 1960s and 70s underpinned the basic concepts, introduced the concept of the "secure base" and developed a theory of a number of attachment patterns in infants: secure attachment, avoidant attachment and anxious attachment.<ref name="Bretherton"/> A fourth pattern, disorganised attachment, was identified later. In the 1980s, the theory was extended to [[Attachment in adults|attachments in adults]].<ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1987"/> Other interactions may be construed as including components of attachment behaviour; these include peer relationships at all ages, romantic and sexual attraction and responses to the care needs of infants or the sick and elderly.

To formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields, including [[evolutionary biology]], [[object relations theory]] (a tenet of [[psychoanalysis]]), [[systems theory|control systems theory]], and the fields of [[ethology]] and [[cognitive psychology]].<ref name="simpson">{{cite encyclopaedia|author=Simpson JA|title=Attachment Theory in Modern Evolutionary Perspective|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|editor= Cassidy J, Shaver PR|year = 1999|pages=115<U+2013>40|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1572300876|location=New York}}</ref> After preliminary papers from 1958 onwards, Bowlby published the full theory in the trilogy ''Attachment and Loss'' (1969<U+2013>82). In the early days of the theory, academic psychologists criticized Bowlby, and the psychoanalytic community ostracised him for his departure from psychoanalytical tenets;<ref name="Rutter 95">{{citejournal|author = Rutter, Michael|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of Attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology & Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549<U+2013>71 |pmid=7650083}}</ref> however, attachment theory has since become the dominant approach to understanding early social development, and has given rise to a great surge of [[empirical research]] into the formation of children's close relationships.<ref name="Schaffer">{{citebook|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|location=Oxford|pages=83<U+2013>121|isbn=0631216286 }}</ref> Later criticisms of attachment theory relate to temperament, the complexity of social relationships, and the limitations of discrete patterns for classifications.

==Attachment==
[[Image:Mozambique024.jpg|thumb|alt=A young mother smiles up at the camera. On her back is her baby gazing at the camera with an expression of lively interest.|right|Although it is usual for the mother to be the primary attachment figure, infants will form attachments to any carer who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them.]]

Within attachment theory, ''attachment'' means an [[Affectional bond|affectional bond]] or tie between an individual and an attachment figure (usually a caregiver). Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. The theory proposes that children attach to carers instinctively,<ref name="BrethQuote">{{citejournal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|quote=[Bowlby] begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like "fixed action patterns" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be "goal-corrected" with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, & Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud<U+2019>s concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but - depending on the organism - can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism<U+2019>s environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms pay a price, however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies.}}</ref> for the purpose of survival and, ultimately, genetic replication.<ref name=pg15/> The biological function is survival and the psychological function is security.<ref name="Schaffer"/> Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist. In child-to-adult relationships, the child's tie is called the "attachment" and the caregiver's reciprocal equivalent is referred to as the "care-giving bond".<ref name=pg15>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 15.</ref>

Infants will form attachments to any consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The quality of the social engagement is more influential than the amount of time spent. The biological mother is the usual principal attachment figure, but the role can be taken by anyone who consistently behaves in a "mothering" way over a period of time. Within attachment theory, this means a set of behaviours that involves engaging in lively social interaction with the infant and responding readily to signals and approaches.<ref>Bowlby (1969) p. 365.</ref> Nothing in the theory suggests that fathers are not equally likely to become principal attachment figures if they happen to provide most of the child care and related social interaction.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] p. 69.</ref>

Some infants direct attachment behaviour (proximity seeking) towards more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers; most come to do so during their second year. These figures are arranged hierarchically, with the principal attachment figure at the top.<ref>Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 304<U+2013>05.</ref> The set-goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain a bond with an accessible and available attachment figure.<ref name=kobmad>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Kobak R, Madsen S|year=2008|title= Disruption in Attachment Bonds|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=23<U+2013>47|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> "Alarm" is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger. "Anxiety" is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure. If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive, separation distress occurs.<ref name="pg16">[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 16.</ref> In infants, physical separation can cause anxiety and anger, followed by sadness and despair. By age three or four, physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child's bond with the attachment figure. Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence, breakdowns in communication, emotional unavailability or signs of rejection or abandonment.<ref name=kobmad/>

===Behaviours===
The attachment behavioural system serves to maintain or achieve closer proximity to the attachment figure.<ref>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 17.</ref>[[Image:Baby exploring books.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A baby sits a rug on the floor surrounded by toys. He stares down at a cloth book in his hands in a posture of interest and concentration.|Insecure attachment patterns can compromise exploration and the achievement of self-confidence. This baby is free to concentrate on his book.]]Pre-attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life. During the first phase (the first eight weeks), infants smile, babble and cry to attract the attention of caregivers. Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers, these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity. During the second phase (two to six months), the infant increasingly discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults, becoming more responsive towards the caregiver; following and clinging is added to its repertoire. Clear-cut attachment develops in the third phase, between the ages of six months and two years. The infant's behaviour towards the caregiver becomes organised on a goal-directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure.<ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 19">[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 19.</ref> By the end of the first year the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity. These manifest as protesting the caregiver's departure, greeting the caregiver's return, clinging when frightened and following when able.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 90<U+2013>92.</ref> With the development of locomotion, the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a safe base from which to explore.<ref name="Prior and Glaser p. 19"/> Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore. If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive, attachment behaviour is strongly activated.<ref name="ainsworth 67">{{citebook|author=Ainsworth M |title=Infancy in Uganda: Infant Care and the Growth of Love|year=1967|isbn=0801800102 |location=Baltimore |publisher=John Hopkins University Press}}</ref> Anxiety, fear, illness and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 90<U+2013>91.</ref> Many attachment behaviours occur only in threatening or uncomfortable circumstances, such as the approach of an unfamiliar person (stranger wariness), and it may be impossible to measure the presence of attachment without creating such circumstances.<ref>[[#Mercer06|Mercer]] p. 51.</ref>
After the second year, as the child begins to see the carer as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed.<ref>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref> Whereas babies will cry because of pain, two-year-olds will cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder or shout or follow. Children also begin to notice others' goals and feelings, planning their actions accordingly.<ref name="Schaffer"/>

===Tenets===
Common human attachment behaviours and emotions are [[Adaption|adaptive]]. Human evolution has involved selection for social behaviours that make individual or group survival more likely. The commonly observed attachment behaviour of toddlers staying near familiar people would have had safety advantages in the environment of early adaptation, and has such advantages today. Bowlby saw the environment of early adaptation as similar to current [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.<ref>Bowlby (1969) p. 300.</ref> There is a survival advantage in the capacity to sense possibly dangerous conditions such as unfamiliarity, being alone or rapid approach. According to Bowlby, proximity-seeking to the attachment figure in the face of threat is the "set-goal" of the attachment behavioural system.<ref name="pg16"/>

The attachment system is very robust and young humans form attachments easily, even in far less than ideal circumstances.<ref name="Bowlby 58">{{citejournal|author = Bowlby J|title = The nature of the child's tie to his mother|journal = International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 350<U+2013>73|year = 1958|pmid = 13610508}}</ref> In spite of this robustness, significant separation from a familiar caregiver<U+2014>or frequent changes of caregiver that prevent the development of attachment<U+2014>may result in psychopathology at some point in later life.<ref name="Bowlby 58"/> Infants in their first months have no preference for their biological parents over strangers. Preferences for certain people, plus behaviours which solicit their attention and care, are developed over a considerable period of time.<ref name="Bowlby 58"/> When an infant is upset by separation from their caregiver, this indicates that the bond no longer depends on the presence of the caregiver, but is of an enduring nature.<ref name="Schaffer"/> [[Image:FemkeD2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young father lies on his back on a quilt on the floor.

The baby has her arms and legs stretched out and arches her back smiling directly at the camera.|Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions and behaviours about the self and others.]]

Bowlby's original [[Critical period|sensitivity period]] of between six months and two to three years has been modified to a less "all or nothing" approach. There is a sensitive period during which it is highly desirable that selective attachments develop, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed. With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate that social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships.<ref name="Rutter 95"/> Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people.<ref name="Bowlby 58"/> According to Bowlby, almost from the first many children have more than one figure towards whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly towards one particular person. Bowlby used the term "monotropy" to describe this bias.<ref>Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. p. 309.</ref> Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean that the relationship with the special figure differs ''qualitatively'' from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.<ref name="Rutter 95"/><ref name="Main">{{cite encyclopedia| author=Main M|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|title=Epilogue: Attachment Theory: Eighteen Points with Suggestions for Future Studies|editor=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|year=1999|pages=845<U+2013>87|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|quote=although there is general agreement that an infant or adult will have only a few attachment figures at most, many attachment theorists and researchers believe that infants form 'attachment hierarchies' in which some figures are primary, others secondary and so on.

Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviours about the self and others.

==Changes in attachment during childhood and adolescence==
Age, cognitive growth and continued social experience advance the development and complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. The preschool period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining.<ref name= "Waters">{{citejournal|author=Waters E, Kondo-Ikemura K, Posada G, Richters J|year=1991|contribution=Learning to love: Mechanisms and milestones|title= Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology|volume= 23|issue=Self-Processes and Development|editor=Gunnar M, Sroufe T|location= Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum}}</ref> For example, four year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their carer have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.<ref name=marbrit>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Marvin RS, Britner PA|year=2008|title= Normative Development: The Ontogeny of Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=269<U+2013>94|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref>[[Image:Children marbles.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Three children aged about 6 years are in a group on the ground, a boy and girl kneeling and another boy seated cross-legged.

Ideally, these social skills become incorporated into the internal working model to be used with other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship.<ref name= "Waters"/> By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact<U+2014>or the possibility of reuniting, if needed<U+2014>is available. There will be a decline in attachment behaviours such as clinging and following, with an increase in self-reliance.<ref name=kerns/> By middle childhood (ages 7<U+2013>11), there may be a shift towards mutual co-regulation of secure-base contact.<ref name= "Waters"/>

In early childhood, parental figures remain the centre of children's social worlds, even if they spend substantial periods of time in alternative care. This lessens, particularly with entrance into formal schooling.<ref name=kerns/> The attachment representations of young children are typically assessed in relation to particular figures. There appear to be limitations in their thinking that restrict their ability to integrate relationship experiences into a single general model. Children usually begin to develop a single general model of attachment relationships during adolescence, although this may occur in middle childhood.<ref name=kerns>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Kerns KA|year=2008|title= Attachment in Middle Childhood|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=366<U+2013>82|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref>

Relationships with peers have an influence distinct from that of parent-child relationships, but the latter can influence the peer relationships children form.<ref name="Schaffer"/> Although peers become important in middle childhood, the evidence suggests peers do not become attachment figures, though children may direct attachment behaviours at peers if parental figures are unavailable. Attachments to peers tend to emerge in adolescence, although parents continue to be attachment figures.<ref name=kerns/> With adolescents, the role of the caregiver is to be available when needed while the adolescent makes sorties into the outside world.<ref>Bowlby (1988) p. 11.</ref>

==Attachment patterns==
{{See also|Attachment in children|Attachment measures}}
Much of attachment theory was informed by [[Mary Ainsworth]]'s innovative methodology and observational studies, particularly those undertaken in Scotland and Uganda. Ainsworth's work expanded the theory's concepts and enabled empirical testing of its tenets.<ref name="Bretherton"/> Using Bowlby's early formulation, she conducted observational research on infant-parent dyads during the child's first year, combining extensive home visits with the study of behaviours in particular situations. This early research was published in 1967 in a book titled ''Infancy in Uganda''.<ref name="Bretherton"/> Ainsworth identified three attachment styles, or patterns, that a child may have with attachment figures: secure, anxious-avoidant (insecure) and anxious-ambivalent or resistant (insecure). She devised a procedure known as the [[Attachment_in_children#Attachment_classification_in_children:_The_Strange_Situation_Protocol|Strange Situation Protocol]] as the laboratory portion of her larger study, to assess separation and reunion behaviour.<ref name="Ainsworth,1978a">{{citebook|author=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |year=1978|title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation|publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location =Hillsdale NJ|isbn=0898594618}}</ref> This is a standardised research tool used to assess attachment patterns in infants and toddlers. By creating stresses designed to activate attachment behaviour, the procedure reveals what use very young children make of their caregiver as a source of security.<ref name="Schaffer"/> Carer and child are placed in an unfamiliar playroom while a researcher records specific behaviours, observing through a one-way mirror. In eight different episodes, the child experiences separation from/reunion with the carer and the presence of an unfamiliar stranger.<ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"/> 

Ainsworth's work in the United States attracted many scholars into the field, inspiring research and challenging the dominance of [[Behaviourism|behaviourism]].<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 163<U+2013>73.</ref> Further research by Dr. [[Mary Main]] and colleagues at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] identified a fourth attachment pattern, called disorganised/disoriented attachment. The name reflects these children's lack of a coherent coping strategy.<ref name="Main & Solomon">{{cite encyclopedia|author= Main M, Solomon J|year=1986 |title=Discovery of an insecure disoriented attachment pattern: procedures, findings and implications for the classification of behavior|encyclopedia= Affective Development in Infancy|editors=Brazelton T, Youngman M|isbn=0893913456|location= Norwood, NJ |publisher= Ablex}}</ref> 

The type of attachment developed by infants depends on the quality of care they have received.<ref name=PPP/> Each of the attachment patterns is associated with certain characteristic patterns of behaviour, as described in the following table:

The presence of an attachment and its quality are distinct. Infants form attachments if there is someone to interact with, even if mistreated. Individual differences in the relationships reflect the history of care, as infants begin to predict the behaviour of caregivers through repeated interactions.<ref name=wsec/> The focus is the organisation (pattern) rather than quantity of attachment behaviours. Insecure attachment patterns are non-optimal as they can compromise exploration, self-confidence and mastery of the environment. However, insecure patterns are also adaptive, as they are suitable responses to caregiver unresponsiveness. For example, in the avoidant pattern, minimising expressions of attachment even in conditions of mild threat may forestall alienating caregivers who are already rejecting, thus leaving open the possibility of responsiveness should a more serious threat arise.<ref name=wsec>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Weinfield NS, Sroufe LA, Egeland B, Carlson E|year=2008|title= Individual Differences in Infant-Caregiver Attachment|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=78<U+2013>101|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> 

Around 65% of children in the general population may be classified as having a secure pattern of attachment, with the remaining 35% being divided between the insecure classifications.<ref name="Karen p. 248<U+2013>66">[[#Karen98|Karen]] p. 248<U+2013>66.</ref> Recent research has sought to ascertain the extent to which a parent's attachment classification is predictive of their children's classification.

Over the short term, the stability of attachment classifications is high, but it becomes less so over the long term.<ref name="Schaffer"/> It appears that stability of classification is linked to stability in caregiving conditions. Social stressors or negative life events<U+2014>such as illness, death, abuse or divorce<U+2014>are associated with instability of attachment patterns from infancy to early adulthood, particularly from secure to insecure.<ref name=delguid/> Conversely, these difficulties sometimes reflect particular upheavals in people's lives, which may change. Sometimes, parents' responses change as the child develops, changing classification from insecure to secure. Fundamental changes can and do take place after the critical early period.<ref name="Karen p. 248<U+2013>66"/> Physically abused and neglected children are less likely to develop secure attachments, and their insecure classifications tend to persist through the pre-school years. Neglect alone is associated with insecure attachment organisations, and rates of disorganised attachment are markedly elevated in maltreated infants.<ref name=PPP/>

This situation is complicated by difficulties in [[Attachment measures|assessing attachment]] classification in older age groups. The Strange Situation procedure is for ages 12 to 18 months only;<ref name="Schaffer"/> adapted versions exist for pre-school children.<ref name=AACAP-2005/> Techniques have been developed to allow verbal ascertainment of the child's state of mind with respect to attachment. An example is the "stem story", in which a child is given the beginning of a story that raises attachment issues and asked to complete it.

Some authors have questioned the idea that a [[wikt:taxonomy|taxonomy]] of categories representing a qualitative difference in attachment relationships can be developed. Examination of data from 1,139 15-month-olds showed that variation in attachment patterns was continuous rather than grouped.<ref name="FraSpe">{{citejournal|author = Fraley RC, Spieker SJ|title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed?

===Significance of attachment patterns===
There is an extensive body of research demonstrating a significant association between attachment organisations and children's functioning across multiple domains.<ref name=PPP>{{citebook|author=Pearce JW, Pezzot-Pearce TD|title=Psychotherapy of abused and neglected children|publisher=Guilford press|edition=2nd|location=New York and London|year=2007|isbn=9781593852139|pages=17<U+2013>20}}</ref> Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, but it is a liability for the child, particularly if parental behaviours continue throughout childhood.<ref name="Karen p. 248<U+2013>66"/> Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become more socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment.<ref name="Schaffer"/> Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function.<ref name=bercasapp>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K|title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=333<U+2013>47|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.<ref name="Schaffer"/>

The most concerning pattern is disorganised attachment. About 80% of maltreated infants are likely to be classified as disorganised, as opposed to about 12% found in non-maltreated samples. Only about 15% of maltreated infants are likely to be classified as secure. Children with a disorganised pattern in infancy tend to show markedly disturbed patterns of relationships. Their subsequent relationships with peers are often characterised by a "fight or flight" pattern of alternate aggression and withdrawal. Maltreated children are also more likely to become maltreating parents, passing on the disordered relationship pattern. A minority do not, achieving instead secure attachments, good relationships with peers and non-abusive parenting styles.<ref name="Schaffer"/> The link between insecure attachment, particularly the disorganised classification, and the emergence of childhood psychopathology is well-established, although it is a non-specific risk factor for future problems, not a pathology or a direct cause of pathology in itself.<ref name="PPP"/> In the classroom, it appears that ambivalent children are at an elevated risk for internalising disorders, and avoidant and disorganised children, for externalising disorders.<ref name=bercasapp/>

One explanation for the effects of early attachment classifications may lie in the internal working model mechanism. Internal models are not just "pictures" but refer to the feelings aroused. They enable a person to anticipate and interpret another's behaviour and plan a response. If an infant experiences their caregiver as a source of security and support, they are more likely to develop a positive self-image and expect positive reactions from others. Conversely, a child from an abusive relationship with the caregiver may internalise a negative self-image and generalise negative expectations into other relationships. The internal working models on which attachment behaviour is based show a degree of continuity and stability. Children are likely to fall into the same categories as their primary caregivers indicating that the caregivers' internal working models affect the way they relate to their child. This effect has been observed to continue across three generations. Bowlby believed that the earliest models formed were the most likely to persist because they existed outside consciousness. Such models are not, however, impervious to change given further relationship experiences; a minority of children have different attachment classifications with different caregivers.<ref name="Schaffer"/>

There is some evidence that gender differences in attachment patterns of adaptive significance begin to emerge in middle childhood. Insecure attachment and early psychosocial stress indicate environmental risk. This can tend to favour the development of strategies for earlier reproduction. However, different patterns have different adaptive values for males and females. Insecure males tend to adopt avoidant strategies, whereas insecure females tend to adopt anxious/ambivalent strategies, unless they are in a very high risk environment. [[Adrenarche]] is proposed as the endocrine mechanism underlying the reorganisation of insecure attachment in middle childhood.<ref name=delguid>{{citejournal|title=Sex, attachment, and the development of reproductive strategies|author=Del Giudice M|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2009|volume=32|pages=1<U+2013>67|doi=10.1017/S0140525X09000016|pmid=19210806 }}</ref>

==Attachment in adults==
{{See also|Attachment in adults|Attachment measures}}
Attachment theory was extended to adult romantic relationships in the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment have been identified in adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganised/disoriented. 

Securely attached adults tend to have positive views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They tend to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor view. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.<ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1987">{{citejournal|author = Hazan C, Shaver PR|title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 52|issue = 3|pages = 511<U+2013>24|year = 1987|month = March|pmid = 3572722|doi = 10.1037/0022<U+2013>3514.52.3.511}}</ref><ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990">{{citejournal|author=Hazan C, Shaver PR|year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270<U+2013>80|doi=10.1037/0022<U+2013>3514.59.2.270}}</ref><ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994">{{citejournal|author=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organisational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1<U+2013>22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}</ref><ref name="BarthoHoro">{{citejournal| author = Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM|title = Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 61|issue = 2|pages = 226<U+2013>44|year = 1991|month = August|pmid = 1920064|doi = 10.1037/0022<U+2013>3514.61.2.226}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of attachment theory}}
{{seealso|Maternal deprivation}}
===Earlier theories===
The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. From the late nineteenth century onward, psychologists and psychiatrists suggested theories about attachment.<ref name="Bretherton">{{citejournal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|page=759|doi=10.1037/0012<U+2013>1649.28.5.759}}</ref> Early [[Freud]]ian theory had little to say about a child's relationship with the mother, postulating only that the breast was the love object.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 89<U+2013>91.</ref> Freudians attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding and gratification of [[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|libidinal drives]]. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist Ian Suttie suggested that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications.<ref name="Suttie">{{citebook|author= Suttie I |year=1935 |title= The origins of love and hate |location= London |isbn=9780415210423|publisher= Penguin}}</ref> [[William Blatz]], a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Mary Ainsworth, also stressed the importance of social relationships for development.

Another theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was "dependency". This proposed that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but outgrew it; attachment behaviour in older children would thus be seen as [[Regression (psychology)|regressive]]. Attachment theory assumes older children and adults retain attachment behaviour, displaying it in stressful situations. Indeed, a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence.<ref>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 20.</ref> Bowlby developed attachment theory as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships.<ref name="Cassidy">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Cassidy J|title=The Nature of a Child's Ties|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|editor= Cassidy J, Shaver PR|year = 1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1572300876|location=New York|pages=3<U+2013>20}}</ref>

===Maternal deprivation===
The early thinking of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]], particularly [[Melanie Klein]], influenced Bowlby. However he profoundly disagreed with the prevalent psychoanalytic belief that infants' responses relate to their internal fantasy life rather than real-life events. As Bowlby formulated his concepts, he was influenced by case studies on disturbed and delinquent children, such as those of Goldfarb.<ref name= "Bowlby 51 quote">{{citebook|title= Maternal Care and Mental Health|year=1951|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organisation|quote=With monotonous regularity each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalisation or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause|author=Bowlby J}}</ref><ref name="Bowlby 44">{{citejournal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=25 |issue=19<U+2013>52 |pages=107<U+2013>27|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}</ref>[[Image:Prayer Time in the Nursery<U+2014>Five Points House of Industry.png|right|280px|thumb|alt=Two rows of little boys, about 20 in total, kneel before their beds in the dormitory of a residential nursery.

He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' which was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents.<ref name= "Schwartz">{{citebook|author= Schwartz J|title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis|year=1999|page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |location=New York|isbn= 0670886238}}</ref>

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organisation]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment", the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This was also published as ''Child Care and the Growth of Love'' for public consumption. The central proposition was influential but highly controversial.<ref name="WHO 62">{{citebook|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|year=1962|issue= No. 14.}}</ref> At the time there was limited empirical data and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.<ref>Bowlby (1988) p. 24.</ref> Nevertheless, Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest and controversy in the nature of early relationships, giving a strong impetus to, (in the words of Mary Ainsworth), a "great body of research" in an extremely difficult, complex area.<ref name="WHO 62"/> Bowlby's work (and Robertson's films) caused a virtual revolution in hospital visiting by parents, hospital provision for children's play, educational and social needs and the use of residential nurseries. Over time, orphanages were abandoned in favour of foster care or family style homes in most developed countries.<ref name=rut>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Rutter M|year=2008|title= Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=958<U+2013>74|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref>

===Formulation of the theory===
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from the fields of evolutionary biology, ethology, [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and control systems theory. He formulated the innovative proposition that mechanisms underlying an infant's tie emerged as a result of [[evolutionary pressure]].<ref name="Cassidy"/> He set out to develop a theory of motivation and behaviour control built on science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud.<ref name="Bretherton"/> Bowlby argued that with attachment theory he had made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''.<ref name="Bowlby 86">{{citeweb|author=Bowlby J|year=1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|format=PDF|volume=50|issue= 18|month=December|publisher=Current Contents|series=Citation Classics|accessdate = July 13, 2008}}</ref>[[Image:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A young mother kneels in a garden with her two children.

A toddler stands slightly in front of his mother holding a spade and frowning at the camera.|Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present; with the caregiver present, the infant's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore.]]

The formal origin of the theory began with the publication of two papers in 1958 the first being Bowlby's "The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother", in which the precursory concepts of "attachment" were introduced. The second was [[Harry Harlow]]'s "The Nature of Love". This latter was based on experiments which showed that infant [[rhesus monkeys]] appeared to form an [[affectional bond]] with soft, cloth [[wikt:surrogate|surrogate]] mothers that offered no food compared to wire surrogate mothers that provided a food source but were less pleasant to touch.<ref name="Bowlby 58"/><ref name="HH">{{citejournal|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Harlow/love.htm|title= The Nature of Love|accessdate=September 5, 2009| year=1958|author=Harlow H|journal=American Psychologist|volume= 13|pages= 573<U+2013>685|doi=10.1037/h0047884}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|quotes = no|author = van der Horst FCP, LeRoy HA, van der Veer R|year = 2008|title = <U+201C>When strangers meet<U+201D>: John Bowlby and Harry Harlow on attachment behavior|journal = Integrative Psychological & Behavioral Science|doi = 10.1007/s12124-008-9079-2|url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/47012q360531r664/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = September 11, 2008|volume = 42|page = 370}}</ref> Bowlby followed up his first paper with two more; "Separation Anxiety" (1960a), and "Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood" (1960b).<ref name="Bowlby 60">{{citejournal|author = Bowlby J|title = Separation anxiety|journal = International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume = 41|pages = 89<U+2013>113|year = 1960|pmid = 13803480}}</ref><ref name="Bowlby 60b">{{citejournal|year=1960|author=Bowlby J |title=Grief and mourning in infancy and early childhood |journal= The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |volume=15 |pages=9<U+2013>52}}</ref> At the same time, Bowlby's colleague [[Mary Ainsworth]], with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind, was completing her extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in [[Uganda]].<ref name="Bretherton"/> Attachment theory was finally presented in 1969 in ''Attachment'', the first volume of the ''Attachment and Loss'' trilogy. The second and third volumes, ''Separation: Anxiety and Anger'' and ''Loss: Sadness and Depression'' followed in 1972 and 1980 respectively. ''Attachment'' was revised in 1982 to incorporate later research.

Attachment theory came at a time when women were asserting their right to equality and independence, giving mothers new cause for anxiety. Attachment theory itself is not gender specific but in Western society it was largely mothers who bore responsibility for early child care. Those with political agendas interpreted the theory for their own purposes. Early opposition to attachment theory coalesced around this issue. Either mothers were seen as the problem, or attachment theory was seen as another vehicle for blaming overburdened mothers.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 189<U+2013>90.</ref>

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read [[Konrad Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form (although Lorenz had published earlier work).<ref name="lorenz 37">{{citejournal |author = Lorenz KZ|year = 1937|title = The companion in the bird<U+2019>s world|journal = The Auk|volume = 54|pages = 245<U+2013>73}}</ref> Soon after, he encountered the work of [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and began to collaborate with [[Robert Hinde]].<ref name="3 vans">{{citejournal|author = van der Horst FCP, van der Veer R, van Ijzendoorn MH|year = 2007|title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde|journal = Attachment & Human Development|volume = 9|issue = 4|pages = 321<U+2013>35|doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809}}</ref><ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] p. 62.</ref> In 1953 Bowlby stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests".<ref name="bowlby 53">{{citejournal|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical Phases in the Development of Social Responses in Man and Other Animals |year=1953 |journal=New Biology| volume=14|pages=25<U+2013>32}}</ref> Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]]", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] or comparable object. After recognition comes a tendency to follow.[[File:Moose-Imprinting-sr81-15.jpg|thumb|right |alt=A young woman in rubber boots is walking through a muddy clearing in a wood at [[Kostroma Moose Farm]] followed by a very young moose, struggling to keep up|This bottle-fed young moose has developed an attachment to [[Kostroma Moose Farm|its carer]].]] The learning is possible only within a limited age range known as a [[critical period]]. Bowlby's concepts included the idea that attachment involved learning from experience during a limited age period, influenced by adult behaviour. He did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment. However, he considered that attachment behaviour was best explained as instinctive, combined with the effect of experience, stressing the readiness the child brings to social interactions.<ref>Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 220<U+2013>23.</ref> Over time it became apparent there were more differences than similarities between attachment theory and imprinting so the analogy was dropped.<ref name="Rutter 95"/>

====Psychoanalysis====
[[Image:Evacuation of Schoolchildren in Japan.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Several lines of school children march diagonally from top right to bottom left. Each carries a bag or bundle and each raises their right arm in the air in a salute. Adults stand in a line across the bottom right hand corner making the same gesture.|Evacuation of smiling Japanese school children in [[World War II]] from the book ''Road to Catastrophe'']] 
[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] concepts influenced Bowlby's view of attachment, in particular, the observations by [[Anna Freud]] and [[Dorothy Burlingham]] of young children separated from familiar caregivers during World War II.<ref name="anna">{{citebook|author=Freud A, Burlingham DT|title=War and children|year=1943 |isbn=9780837169422|publisher=Medical War Books}}</ref> However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds including "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive theory]]" in which the motivation for attachment derives from gratification of hunger and libidinal drives. He called this the "cupboard-love" theory of relationships. In his view it failed to see attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] pp. 62<U+2013>63.</ref> Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-Darwinism, Bowlby identified what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis. Firstly the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat. Secondly the picture of the development of personality via linear "phases" with "[[regression (psychology)|regression]]" to fixed points accounting for psychological distress. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.<ref>[[#Holmes93|Holmes]] pp. 64<U+2013>65.</ref>

From early in the development of attachment theory there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with various branches of psychoanalysis. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on similar problems.<ref name="Steele">{{citejournal|author= Steele H, Steele M|year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92<U+2013>119|doi= 10.1111/1467<U+2013>9507.00053}}</ref><ref name="Cass 98">{{citejournal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120<U+2013>26|doi= 10.1111/1467<U+2013>9507.00054}}</ref><ref name="Steele 98"> {{citejournal|author=Steele H, Steele M|year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92<U+2013>119 |doi=10.1111/1467<U+2013>9507.00053}}</ref> Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community.<ref name="Rutter 95"/>

====Internal working model====
Bowlby adopted the important concept of the internal working model of social relationships from the work of the philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]]. Craik had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events. He stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a "small-scale model" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to attachment, other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.<ref name="JLaird">{{citebook|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0674568818 |pages=179-87|title= Mental models| location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}</ref>

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems ([[Cybernetics|cybernetics]]), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking.<ref name="Robbins">{{citejournal|author = Robbins P, Zacks JM|title = Attachment theory and cognitive science: commentary on Fonagy and Target|journal = Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association|volume = 55|issue = 2|pages = 457<U+2013>67; discussion 493<U+2013>501|year = 2007|pmid = 17601100}}</ref> The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing [[Homeostasis|homeostatically]] with the need for exploration. (Bowlby compared this process to physiological homeostasis whereby, for example, blood pressure is kept within limits). The actual distance maintained by the child would vary as the balance of needs changed. For example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child exploring at a distance to seek proximity. The child's goal is not an object (the caregiver) but a state; maintenance of the desired distance from the caregiver depending on circumstances.<ref name="Cassidy"/>

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby's reliance on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) in early attachment behaviours. An infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seemed to occur months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible.<ref name="fraiberg">{{citejournal|author = Fraiberg S|title = Libidinal object constancy and mental representation|journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume = 24 |pages = 9<U+2013>47|year = 1969|pmid = 5353377}}</ref> More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be more specific than those of Bowlby's time.<ref name="waters2">{{citejournal|author = Waters HS, Waters E|title = The attachment working models concept: among other things, we build script-like representations of secure base experiences|journal = Attachment and Human Development|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages = 185<U+2013>97|year = 2006|month = September|pmid = 16938702|doi = 10.1080/14616730600856016}}</ref>

====Behaviourism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with positive reinforcement experiences through their mutual attention, thereby learning to stay close together. This explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment.<ref name= "Gewirtz">{{citejournal|author= Gewirtz N|year=1969|title=Potency of a social reinforcer as a function of satiation and recovery|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 1|pages= 2<U+2013>13|doi= 10.1037/h0026802}}</ref> Learning theory, ([[behaviourism]]), saw attachment as a remnant of dependency with the quality of attachment being merely a response to the caregiver's cues. Behaviourists saw behaviours like crying as a random activity meaning nothing until reinforced by a caregiver's response. To behaviourists, frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists' view.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 166<U+2013>73.</ref> 

In the last decade, [[Behavior analysis of child development|behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research<ref name="kassow">{{citejournal|author=Kassow DZ, Dunst CJ|year=2004|title= Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes|journal= Bridges|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 1<U+2013>17}}</ref> and meta-analytic reviews.<ref name="dunst">{{citejournal|author=Dunst CJ, Kassow DZ|year=2008|title= Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume= 5|issue=1|pages= 40<U+2013>56|issn=1554<U+2013>4893}}</ref>

====Developments====
As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, there was criticism of the empirical support for the theory. Possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research were proposed.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 115<U+2013>18.</ref> Some of Bowlby's interpretations of James Robertson's data were rejected by the researcher when he reported data from 13 young children cared for in ideal rather than institutional circumstances on separation from their mothers.<ref name="robertson">{{cite journal|author = Robertson J, Robertson J |quote=Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent| title = Young children in brief separation.

He concluded there was an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there were biological or genetic risk factors.<ref name="Skuse">{{citejournal|author = Skuse D|title = Extreme deprivation in early childhood<U+2014>II.

Bowlby's arguments that even very young babies were social creatures and primary actors in creating relationships with parents took some time to be accepted. So did Ainsworth's emphasis on the importance and primacy of maternal attunement for psychological development (a point also argued by [[Donald Winnicott]]). In the 1970s [[Daniel Stern (psychologist)|Daniel Stern]] undertook research on the concept of attunement between very young infants and caregivers, using micro-analysis of video evidence. This  added significantly to the understanding of the complexity of infant/caregiver interactions as an integral part of a baby's emotional and social development.<ref>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 345<U+2013>57.</ref>

In the 1970s, problems with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.<ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977">{{citejournal|author=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184<U+2013>99|doi=10.2307/1128475}}</ref> This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's, logic, coherence and status as an organizational construct.<ref name="WatCum">{{citejournal|author = Waters E, Cummings EM|title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships|journal = Child Development|volume = 71|issue = 1|pages = 164<U+2013>72|year = 2000|pmid = 10836570|doi = 10.1111/1467<U+2013>8624.00130}}</ref> Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined.<ref name="Tronick">{{citejournal|author=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK|year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568<U+2013>77|doi=10.1037/0012<U+2013>1649.28.4.568}}</ref> The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.[[Image:Khmerchildren.jpg|thumb|right|alt=On the right a young boy of asiatic appearance with a pudding basin haircut, leans over a baby lying on its back on the left.

Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact.

The biggest challenge to the notion of the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of ''[[amae]]'' plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments revolved around the appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory.<ref name=ijzsag/> Most recently a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main & Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.<ref name="Behrens">{{citejournal|author = Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M|title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1553<U+2013>67|year = 2007|month = November|pmid = 18020832|doi = 10.1037/0012<U+2013>1649.43.6.1553}}</ref><ref name= "MainCass">{{citejournal|author= Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415<U+2013>26|doi= 10.1037/0012<U+2013>1649.24.3.415}}</ref> 

Critics in the 1990s such as [[J. R. Harris]], [[Stephen Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] were generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[nature versus nurture]]), stressing the effects of later experience on personality.<ref name="harris">{{citebook|title=The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|pages=1<U+2013>4|isbn=9780684844091 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free Press}}</ref><ref name="pinker">{{citebook|isbn=9780140276053

He argued that heredity was far more important than the transient effects of early environment. For example a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.<ref name=kartemp>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 248<U+2013>64.</ref> Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, broadly demonstrating that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament.<ref name=vbv/> Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence of parents had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialisation took place primarily in peer groups. H. Rudolph Schaffer concluded that parents and peers had different functions, fulfilling distinctive roles in children's development.<ref name="schaffer">{{citebook|author =Schaffer HR|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher=Blackwell|year = 2004|isbn=9780631216278|page=113|location=Oxford}}</ref>

==Recent developments==
Whereas Bowlby was inspired by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s insights into children's thinking, current attachment scholars utilise insights from contemporary literature on implicit knowledge, [[theory of mind]], [[autobiographical memory]] and [[social representations|social representation]].<ref name=thompson>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Thompson RA|year=2008|title= Early Attachment and Later Developments|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=348<U+2013>65|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> Psychoanalyst/psychologists [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship through cognitive science as [[mentalization]].<ref name="Robbins"/> Mentalization, or theory of mind, is the capacity of human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression.<ref name="Fonagy et al."> {{citebook|author=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M|year=2002 |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self|location= New York|publisher=Other Press|isbn=1590511611}}</ref> This connection between theory of mind and the internal working model may open new areas of study, leading to alterations in attachment theory.<ref>[[#Mercer06|Mercer]] pp. 165<U+2013>68.</ref>[[Image:ParentsDaughterAug1931.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A couple stand on the front steps of a house.

One focus of attachment research has been the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late 20th century, during which some authors stressed the deleterious effects of day care.<ref name="belsky">{{citejournal|author = Belsky J, Rovine MJ|title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment|journal = Child Development|volume = 59|issue = 1|pages = 157<U+2013>67|year = 1988|month = February|pmid = 3342709|doi = 10.2307/1130397}}</ref> As a result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues, including the need for relationship-building by the assignment of a child to a specific carer. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.<ref>[[#Mercer06|Mercer]] pp. 160<U+2013>63.</ref> 
 
Another significant area of research and development has been the connection between problematic attachment patterns, particularly disorganised attachment, and the risk of later psychopathology.<ref name=thompson/> A third has been the effect on development of children having little or no opportunity to form attachments at all in their early years. A [[natural experiment]] permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families after the end of the [[Ceasescu]] regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.<ref>{{citejournal| author = Rutter M| year = 2002| month = Jan/February| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1<U+2013>21| pmid = 14717240|doi = 10.1111/1467<U+2013>8624.00388}}</ref> Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.<ref name=PPP/>  

Authors considering attachment in non-Western cultures have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time.<ref name="MC">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Miyake K, Chen SJ|year=1985|title= Infant temperament, mother's mode of interaction, and attachment in Japan: An interim report|editor= Bretherton I, Waters E|encyclopedia= Growing Points of Attachment Theory and Research: Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|pages= 276-97|volume= 50 (1<U+2013>2, Serial No. 209|isbn=9780226074115 )}}</ref> As children's experience of care changes, so may attachment-related experiences. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers or being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change has made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries. There has been an increase in the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources in first-world countries. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and gained legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.<ref>[[#Mercer06|Mercer]] pp. 152<U+2013>56.</ref> Issues have been raised to the effect that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences, as infants often have multiple relationships within the family and in child care settings.<ref name="McHale">{{citejournal|author= McHale JP|year=2007|title=When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems|journal= Infant Mental Health Journal|volume= 28|pages= 370<U+2013>92|doi= 10.1002/imhj.20142}}</ref>

==Biology of attachment==
Attachment theory proposes that the quality of caregiving from at least the primary carer is key to attachment security or insecurity.<ref name=kartemp/> In addition to longitudinal studies, there has been [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] research on the biology of attachment.<ref name=foxhane>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Fox NA, Hane AA|title=Studying the Biology of Human Attachment|year=2008|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=811<U+2013>29|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> Research has begun to include [[behaviour genetics]] and [[temperament]] concepts.<ref name= vbv/> Generally temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute to a range of interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes.<ref name= vbv>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Vaughn BE, Bost KK, van IJzendoorn MH|year=2008|title=Attachment and Temperament |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=192<U+2013>216|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years.<ref name="Marshall & Fox (2005)"> {{cite journal |year=2005 |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |pages=492<U+2013>502 |doi= 10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |author=Marshall PJ, Fox NA}}</ref> In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.<ref name="prior">[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] p. 219.</ref>

In psychophysiological research on attachment, the two main areas studied have been [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic response]]s, such as heart rate or respiration, and the activity of the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. Infants' physiological responses have been measured during the Strange Situation procedure looking at individual differences in infant temperament and the extent to which attachment acts as a moderator. There is some evidence that the quality of caregiving shapes the development of the neurological systems which regulate stress.<ref name=foxhane/> 

Another issue is the role of inherited genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of [[Polymorphism_(biology)#Genetic_polymorphism|polymorphism]] of the ''[[DRD2]]'' [[dopamine receptor]] gene has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT<sub>2A</sub>]] [[serotonin receptor]] gene with avoidant attachment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillath O, Shaver PR, Baek JM, Chun DS |title=Genetic correlates of adult attachment style |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=10 |pages=1396<U+2013>405 |year=2008 |month=October |pmid=18687882 |doi=10.1177/0146167208321484 |url=}}</ref> This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.<ref name=belsky>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Belsky J, Pasco Fearon RM|year=2008|title=Precursors of Attachment Security |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=295<U+2013>316|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref>

==Practical applications==
As a theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]], attachment theory has implications and practical applications in social policy, decisions about the care and welfare of children and mental health.
 
===Child care policies===
Social policies concerning the care of children were the driving force in Bowlby's development of attachment theory. The difficulty lies in applying attachment concepts to policy and practice.<ref name=rut08>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Rutter M|title=Implications of Attachment Theory and Research for Child Care Policies|editor=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=958<U+2013>74|isbn=9781606230282}}</ref> This is because the theory emphasises the importance of continuity and sensitivity in caregiving relationships rather than a behavioural approach on stimulation or reinforcement of child behaviours.<ref name=rut99>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Rutter M, O'Connor TG|title=Implications of Attachment Theory for Child Care Policies|editor=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|location=New York|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=823<U+2013>44|isbn=1572300876}}</ref> In 2008 [[C.H. Zeanah]] and colleagues stated, "Supporting early child-parent relationships is an increasingly prominent goal of mental health practitioners, community based service providers and policy makers...Attachment theory and research have generated important findings concerning early child development and spurred the creation of programs to support early child-parent relationships".<ref name="BZL">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Berlin L, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF|title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|editor=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=2008|location=New York and London|publisher=Guilford Press|pages=745<U+2013>61|isbn=9781606230282}}</ref> 

Historically, attachment theory had significant policy implications for hospitalised or institutionalised children, and those in poor quality daycare.<ref name=k252>[[#Karen98|Karen]] pp. 252<U+2013>58.</ref> Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although it is difficult to provide good quality, individualised care in group settings.<ref name=rut08/>

Attachment theory has implications in [[Residence in English family law|residence]] and [[Contact (law)|contact]] disputes,<ref name=k252/> and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus focusing on the quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. However, arguments tend to focus on whether children are "attached" or "bonded" to the disputing adults rather than the quality of attachments. [[Michael Rutter|Rutter]] noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships.<ref name=rut99/> Children tend to have security-providing relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along with the impact of step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.<ref name=rut08/> 

Attachment theory can also inform decisions made in [[social work]] and court processes about [[foster care]] or other placements. Considering the child<U+2019>s attachment needs can help determine the level of risk posed by placement options.<ref name=0to3>{{citejournal|title=Separation and Reunification: Using Attachment Theory and Research to Inform Decisions Affecting the Placements of Children in Foster Care|author=Goldsmith DF, Oppenheim D, Wanlass J|journal=Juvenile and Family Court Journal|volume=Spring|year= 2004|page=1<U+2013>14|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/AttachmentandFosterCare.pdf?docID=2542|accessdate=2009<U+2013>06<U+2013>19}}</ref> Within adoption, the shift from "closed" to "open" adoptions and the importance of the search for biological parents would be expected on the basis of attachment theory. Many researchers in the field were strongly influenced by it.<ref name=rut08/>

===Clinical practice in children===
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of [[Developmental psychology|socioemotional development]] with one of the broadest, deepest research lines in modern psychology, it has, until recently, been less used in clinical practice than theories with far less [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support.
[[Image:Father and child, Dhaka.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young father dressed in a pink cotton shirt holds his child and gazes at the camera looking proud but tired. The little girl, wearing a sleeveless dress, sits on her father's arm and frowns directly at the camera.|In the early months of life, babies will direct attachment behaviours towards anyone in the vicinity. As attachment develops, so does age-appropriate stranger wariness.]]

This may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also be partly due to the mistaken association of attachment theory with the [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] interventions misleadingly known as "[[attachment therapy]]".<ref name="Ziv"> {{cite encyclopedia|author=Ziv Y| title=Attachment-Based Intervention programs: Implications for Attachment Theory and Research|encyclopedia= Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |series= Duke series in child development and public policy |editor= Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT|year=2005|publisher= Guilford Press | location=New York and London|isbn= 1593854706|page=63}}</ref> 

=====Prevention and treatment=====
{{Main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
In 1988, Bowlby published a series of lectures indicating how attachment theory and research could be used in understanding and treating child and family disorders. His focus for bringing about change was the parents' internal working models, parenting behaviours and the parents' relationship with the therapeutic intervenor.<ref name=berlinetal>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prevention and Intervention Programs for Supporting Early Attachment Security|pages=745<U+2013>61|author=Berlin LJ, Zeanah CH, Lieberman AF|editor=Cassidy J, Shaver PR|year=2008|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York and London|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> Ongoing research has led to a number of individual treatments and prevention and intervention programmes.<ref name=berlinetal/> They range from individual therapy to public health programmes to interventions designed for foster carers. For infants and younger children, the focus is on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver.<ref>[[#PriorGlaser06|Prior and Glaser]] pp. 231<U+2013>32.</ref><ref name="BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003)">{{citejournal |author=Bakermans-Kranenburg M, van IJzendoorn M, Juffer F |year=2003 |title=Less is more: meta-analyses of sensitivity and attachment interventions in early childhood |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |pages=195<U+2013>215 |doi=10.1037/0033<U+2013>2909.129.2.195}}</ref> An assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the caregiver is invariably included, as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behaviour and caregiver response. Some programmes are aimed at foster carers because the attachment behaviours of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Modern prevention and intervention programmes are mostly in the process of being evaluated.<ref name="Stovall2000">{{citejournal |author=Stovall KC, Dozier M |title=The development of attachment in new relationships: single subject analyses for 10 foster infants |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=133<U+2013>56 |year=2000 |pmid=10847621 |doi=10.1017/S0954579400002029}}</ref>

=====Reactive attachment disorder and attachment disorder=====
{{Main|Reactive attachment disorder|Attachment disorder}}
One atypical attachment pattern is considered to be an actual disorder, known as ''reactive attachment disorder'' or RAD, which is a recognized psychiatric diagnosis ([[ICD-10]] F94.1/2 and [[DSM-IV-TR]] 313.89). The essential feature of reactive attachment disorder is markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts that begins before age five years, associated with gross pathological care. There are two subtypes, one reflecting a disinhibited attachment pattern, the other an inhibited pattern. RAD is not a description of insecure attachment styles, however problematic those styles may be; instead, it denotes a lack of age-appropriate attachment behaviours that amounts to a clinical disorder.<ref name="Thompson (2000)">{{citejournal |author=Thompson RA |title=The legacy of early attachments |journal=Child Development |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=145<U+2013>52 |year=2000 |pmid=10836568 |doi=10.1111/1467<U+2013>8624.00128}}</ref> Although the term "reactive attachment disorder" is now popularly applied to perceived behavioural difficulties that fall outside the DSM or ICD  criteria, particularly on the Web and in connection with the pseudo-scientific attachment therapy, "true RAD is thought to be rare.<ref name="chaffin">{{citejournal |author=Chaffin M, Hanson R, Saunders BE, ''et al.'' |title=Report of the APSAC task force on attachment therapy, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment problems|journal=Child Maltreatment |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=76<U+2013>89 |year=2006 |pmid=16382093 |doi=10.1177/1077559505283699}}</ref>

"Attachment disorder" is an ambiguous term, which may be used to refer to reactive attachment disorder or to the more problematical insecure attachment styles (although none of these are clinical disorders). It may also be used to refer to proposed new classification systems put  forward by theorists in the field,<ref>Prior and  Glaser pp. 223<U+2013>25.</ref> and is used within attachment therapy as a form of unvalidated diagnosis.<ref name="chaffin"/>

===Clinical practice in adults and families===
{{Main|Attachment-based psychotherapy|Emotionally focused therapy}}
As attachment theory offers a broad, far-reaching view of human functioning, it can enrich a therapist's understanding of patients and the therapeutic relationship rather than dictate a particular form of treatment.<ref name="Slade 2008">{{cite encyclopedia|author= Slade A|year=2008|title= Attachment Theory and Research: Implications for the theory and practice of individual psychotherapy with adults|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=762<U+2013>82|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref> Some forms of psychoanalysis-based therapy for adults<U+2014>within [[relational psychoanalysis]] and other approaches<U+2014>also incorporate attachment theory and patterns.<ref name="Slade 2008"/><ref name="Sable">{{citebook|author=Sable P|year=2000|isbn=9780765702845|title= Attachment & Adult Psychotherapy|location= Northvale, NJ|publisher= Aaronson}}</ref> In the 2000s, key concepts of attachment were incorporated into existing models of behavioural couple therapy, multidimensional family therapy and [[couple and family therapy]]. Specifically attachment-centred interventions have been developed, such as attachment-based family therapy and emotionally focused therapy.<ref name=johnson>{{cite encyclopedia|author= Johnson SM|year=2008|title= Couple and Family Therapy: An Attachment Perspective|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications| editors= Cassidy J, Shaver PR| publisher= Guilford Press|location= New York and London|pages=811<U+2013>29|isbn=9781593858742}}</ref><ref name="Johnson">{{citebook|author=Johnson S|year=2002|title= Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy with Trauma Survivors|location=New York|publisher= Guilford Press|isbn=9781593851651}}</ref> 

Attachment theory and research laid the foundation for the development of the understanding of "[[mentalization]]" or reflective functioning and its presence, absence or distortion in psychopathology. The dynamics of an individual's attachment organization and their capacity for mentalization can play a crucial role in the capacity to be helped by treatment.<ref name="Slade 2008"/><ref name="FonThe">{{cite encyclopaedia|title=Handbook of Mentalization-Based Treatment|year=2006|editor=Allen JP, Fonagy P|isbn=9780470015612|location=Chichester, UK|publisher= John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>
