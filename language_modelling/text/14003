'''Goodman Beaver''' is a comics character created by American cartoonist [[Harvey Kurtzman]].  Goodman was a na<U+00EF>ve and optimistic [[Candide]]-like character, oblivious to the corruption and degeneration around him. The stories were vehicles for biting social satire and pop culture parody.  Except for the character's first appearance, which Kurtzman did solo, the stories were written by Kurtzman and drawn by [[Will Elder]].

Goodman first appeared in a story in ''[[Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book]]'' in 1959, but the best-remembered strips were the five stories produced by the Kurtzman<U+2014>Elder team in 1961<U+2013>1962 for the Kurtzman-edited magazine ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''.  They tended to be in the parodic style Kurtzman had developed when he did ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' in the 1950s, but with more pointed, adult-oriented satire and much more refined and detailed draftsmanship on Elder's part, crammed with countless [[visual gag]]s.

The most famous of the Goodman Beaver stories was "Goodman Goes Playboy".  A satire on the hedonistic lifestyle of [[Hugh Hefner]] using parodies of [[List of Archie Comics characters|''Archie Comics'' characters]], the story drew the ire of the [[Archie Comics|''Archie''{{'}}s publisher]], which threatened a lawsuit.  The issue was settled out of court, and the copyright for the story passed to Archie Comics.  Hefner, the actual target of the strip, found it amusing, which led to Kurtzman and Elder developing a female version of Goodman Beaver for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine called ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''.

==Overview==
Goodman Beaver is a [[Naivety|na<U+00EF>ve]] and [[Optimism|optimistic]] [[Candide]]-like{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Rothschild|2y=1995|2p=66|3a1=Mautner|3y=2010|4a1=Dooley|4y=2008|5a1=Kitchen|5a2=Buhle|5y=2009|5p=204}} character, oblivious to the degeneration around him.{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Rothschild|2y=1995|2p=66}}   According to Kurtzman, the character was partially inspired by [[Voltaire]]'s ''Candide'' and [[Harold Gray]]'s comic strip character [[Little Orphan Annie]], who, like Goodman, was drawn with blank circles for eyes.{{sfn|Kurtzman|Elder|1962|p=3}}  Art critic [[Greil Marcus]] compares Goodman to [[Young Goodman Brown]] in [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s tale of the same name.  Both are pure characters disillusioned by the depravity they confront in the world.{{sfn|Marcus|2005}}

Kurtzman wrote five Goodman Beaver stories for long-time collaborator Will Elder.  Published in the Kurtzman-edited ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]'' in the early 1960s,{{sfn|Dooley|2008}} they were drawn in Elder's "chickenfat" style, in which he crammed every panel with humorous detail and throwaway [[Visual gag|gags]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rogers|1y=2009|2a1=Evry|2y=1999}}  Most of the stories were in the parodic style Kurtzman had developed as the creator/editor/writer of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', but dealt with more significant issues concerning modernity.{{sfn|Evry|1999}}

==Stories==

==="The Organization Man in the Gray Flannel Executive Suit"===
{{Main|Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book#"The Organization Man in the Gray Flannel Executive Suit"|l1=''Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book'': "The Organization Man in the Gray Flannel Executive Suit"}}
As an editor hired by Schlock Publications Inc., Goodman loses his youthful idealism when awash in the sea of avarice and selfishness he encounters in the publishing world.  Kurtzman used his own personal experiences in this story to satirize the corrupting influence of capitalism and power.{{sfnm|1a1=Rothschild|1y=1995|1p=67|2a1=Spiegelman|2y=1988|2p=viii}}  Goodman finds himself groping the secretaries, just as the other cynical executives at Schlock do, and ends up stealing from the company.{{sfnm|1a1=Buhle|1y=2007|1p=329|2a1=Harris-Fain|2y=2012}}  Goodman was a semi-autobiographical character, reflecting Kurtzman's disillusioning experiences in the publishing industry.{{sfn|Spiegelman|1988|pp=xii<U+2013>ix}}

==="Goodman Meets T*rz*n"===
This story throws a modern 1960s spin on the romance of jungle adventure as exemplified by the [[Tarzan]] tales.{{sfn|Evry|1999}}<!--can we have more than one bland sentence about this?--> <!-- Sure, once we get a source to back it up -->

==="Goodman Goes Playboy"===
[[File:Goodman Goes Playboy page 4 panel 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Comic strip panel|In "Goodman Goes Playboy" (1962), Kurtzman and Elder satirize [[Hugh Hefner]]'s swinging lifestyle, using parodies of ''[[Archie Comics]]'' characters.]]
''Help!''{{'}}s most famous story{{sfn|Edison|2011|p=86}} was "Goodman Goes ''Playboy'' in the February 1962{{efn|The February 1962 issue of ''Help!''  appeared in late 1961.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}} }} issue of ''Help!''.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=185}}  The story satirized [[Hugh Hefner]] and his lifestyle, while parodying ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics in a much more outlandish way than Kurtzman's parody "Starchie" in ''Mad'' a decade earlier.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}}

Goodman has returned to his hometown,{{sfn|Marcus|2005}} and the ''Archie'' characters, home from college, are drinking, partying, skirt-chasing [[Hedonism|hedonists]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kitchen|1a2=Buhle|1y=2009|1p=204|2a1=Harvey|2y=2011|2p=4}} [[Jughead Jones|Jughead]] is a [[beatnik]], and the others are leading glamorous lifestyles.  [[Archie Andrews (comics)|Archie Andrews]] parody Archer explains to a behind-the-times Goodman, "You've been away too long.  Nowadays, the gang is interested mainly in hip-ness<U+2014>awareness", rather than keeping up with how the football team is doing.  Archer shows Goodman to his place, which must be entered through a staircase built into an enormous statue of a female abdomen.  He has Goodman changed into a [[toga]] and leads him into an Roman [[orgy]] underway.  The party is Archer's last, as he reveals he has signed a [[Deal with the Devil|pact with the devil]], and the debt was due that night.{{sfn|Marcus|2005}}

Kurtzman called this his favorite Goodman Beaver story, and said that Hefner would point people to it he wanted to explain to people what Kurtzman's work was about.{{sfn|Benson|2006|p=32}}

==="Goodman, Underwater"===
Framed within the story of ''[[Don Quixote]]'',{{sfn|Dooley|2008}} "Goodman, Underwater" satirizes [[Cold War]] tensions{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=195}} and sets out to deflate the deluded ideals of do-gooders{{sfn|Dooley|2008}} while parodying the 1960s television series ''[[Sea Hunt]]''.{{sfn|Dooley|2008}}

==="Goodman Meets S*perm*n"===
In the early 1950s, Kurtzman first parodied [[Superman]] in "[[Superduperman]]".  In "Goodman Meets S*perm*n", Goodman stumbles across the superhero on a fishing trip.  S*perm*n has gone into hiding from society, sporting a beard and [[moccasin]]s.{{sfn|Rogers|2009}}  He no longer has the desire to help a society he has lost faith in,{{sfn|Dooley|2008}} and which criticizes him for his good deeds.  Goodman takes him back to the city to prove that society is still full of good people.  S*perm*n is horrified by the degeneration and corruption he actually sees, and abandons society again.{{sfn|Rogers|2009}}

Elder described this story, and its detailed [[Glossary of comics terminology#Splash page|splash page]], as "[[Marx Brothers]] on paper.  You never knew what to expect", referring to the busy wealth of gags it was filled with.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=186}}

==="Goodman Gets a Gun"===
Goodman, who normally passively observes the goings-on around him, attempts to assert himself and live out his fantasies.{{sfn|Evry|1999}}<!--and...?--> <!-- and that's all the sources I have say -->

Goodman Beaver made his first appearance in ''[[Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book]]''{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}} in 1959,{{sfn|Rothschild|1995}} in "The Organization Man in the Gray Flannel Executive Suit".{{sfn|Spiegelman|1988|pp=xii<U+2013>ix}}  ''Jungle Book'' was the first American book of original comics,{{sfnm|1a1=Corliss|1y=2004|1p=4|2a1=Kitchen|2a2=Buhle|2y=2009|2p=151|3a1=Luciano|3y=1987|3p=49}} a mass-market paperback{{sfn|Spiegelman|1988|p=vii}} that was the first in a planned series.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|pp=150<U+2013>151, 153}}  The book sold poorly, but was a favorite among Kurtzman fans.{{sfn|Groth|2006|p=127}}

The first Elder-drawn Goodman story appeared in ''Help!'' #12 in 1961, and was followed in 1962 with four more stories in ''Help!'' #13<U+2013>16.{{sfn|Groth|Sadowski|2006|pp=18<U+2013>19}}  The orgy scene in "Goodman Goes Playboy" in #13 was altered with white ink covering all the exposed nipples prior to publication.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=210}}  A Goodman Beaver collection called ''Executive's Comic Book'' appeared in 1962{{sfn|Cooke|Roach|2001|p=26}} from [[MacFadden Publications|MacFadden]] Books.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=186}}  In this paperback collection, the strips were reformatted to one panel per page.  Elder extended the artwork of each panel to fit the page dimensions.{{sfn|Cooke|Roach|2001|p=246}}  This collection included "Goodman Goes Playboy" among its four stories,{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=186}} with the parody ''Archie'' characters altered to obscure the resemblance to characters they were based on.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|p=4}}

Kurtzman approached Hugh Hefner in 1960 with the idea of a comic strip feature for ''Playboy'' that would star Goodman Beaver.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=210}}  ''Playboy'' ran a lot of cartoons, but a comic strip was something new.  After tossing ideas back and forth, Kurtzman was given the go-ahead, but Goodman Beaver had to be transformed into a voluptuous female.  Kurtzman brought in Will Elder as his primary collaborator on ''[[Little Annie Fanny]]''.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=211}}

In 1984, [[Kitchen Sink Press]] published a collection called ''Goodman Beaver'' which reprinted four Kurtzman/Elder stories from ''Help!'',{{sfn|Rothschild|1995|p=66}}<U+2014>all the Elder-drawn stories except for "Goodman Goes Playboy", which appeared only in short excerpts permitted by [[fair use]] exemptions under [[Copyright law of the United States|US copyright law]].{{sfn|Markstein|2010}}

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Goodman Goes Playboy page 2 panel 3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Comic strip panel|The parodic depictions of ''[[Archie Comics]]'' characters in "Goodman Goes Playboy" prompted a lawsuit from the characters' publisher.]]
Kurtzman had avoided drawing legal fire from the litigious [[DC Comics]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]] when he parodied their copyrighted properties, but the saturnalian depictions of the ''Archie'' characters in "Goodman Goes Playboy" provoked legal action from ''Archie'' publisher [[John Goldwater]],{{sfn|Markstein|2010}} who had earlier played a role in founding the comics industry's self-[[censorship]] body, the [[Comics Code Authority|Comics Magazine Association of America]].{{sfn|Harvey|2011|p=4}}

''Help!'' publisher [[James Warren (publisher)|Jim Warren]] received a letter on 6 December 1961 accusing ''Help!'' of [[copyright infringement]], and demanded removal of the offending issue from newsstands.  Warren could not [[Product recall|recall]] the magazine,{{sfn|Harvey|2011|p=4}} but agreed to settle out of court rather than risk an expensive lawsuit. Warren's action disappointed Kurtzman, who felt that giving in to such censorship amounted to a kind of prostitution.{{efn|As Kurtzman stated, he settling the lawsuit was "very, very wrong...very bad.  I thought I had really prostituted myself by going along".{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}} }}  Warren paid Archie Comics $1000, and ran a note of apology in a subsequent issue of ''Help!''.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}}

The story was reprinted in the book collection ''Executive Comic Book'' in 1962, with the artwork modified by Elder to obscure the appearance of the ''Archie'' characters.  Archie Comics found their appearance still too close to their copyrighted properties, and threatened another lawsuit.  Kurtzman and Elder settled out of court by handing over the copyright to the story.  Archie Comics held on to the copyright and refused to allow the story to be republished.  A request from Denis Kitchen in 1983 to include the story in their ''Goodman Beaver'' reprint collection was turned down.{{sfn|Harvey|2011|p=4}}

After ''Comics Journal'' co-owner [[Gary Groth]] discovered that Archie Comics had let the copyright on "Goodman Goes Playboy" expire, he had the story reprinted in ''The Comics Journal'' #262 (September 2004).{{sfnm|1a1=Markstein|1y=2010|2a1=Petersen|2y=2010|2p=249}} It was also made available as a [[PDF]] on the magazine's website.{{sfn|Frauenfelder|2008}}

The actual target of "Goodman Goes Playboy" had been Hefner, however, who loved it.  Shortly after, Kurtzman began working for Hefner again.{{sfn|Kitchen|Buhle|2009|p=204}}  The strip Kurtzman produced, ''Little Annie Fanny'', is often thought of as a compromise<U+2014>virtuosic in its visuals, but lacking in content in comparison to the Goodman Beaver stories.  Some consider this ironic in light of the [[Faust|Faustian]] theme of "Goodman Goes Playboy".{{sfnm|1a1=Dooley|1y=2008|2a1=Smith|2y=2007|p=96|3a1=Fiore|3y=2006|3p=155}}

Will Elder considered the Goodman Beaver stories to be the funniest of his collaborations with Kurtzman,{{sfn|Rothschild|1995|p=66}} though towards the end of the run he was getting tired of the painstaking work he put into drawing it.{{sfn|Groth|2011|p=9}}  The stories placed sixty-fourth on ''[[The Comics Journal]]''{{'}}s "Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century" in 1999,{{sfn|Evry|1999}} along with four other works with which Kurtzman was involved.{{sfn|Spurgeon|1999|p=108}}
