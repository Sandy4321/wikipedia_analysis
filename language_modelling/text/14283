'''Stretford''' (pop. 37,500) is a town within the [[Trafford|Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]], in [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]]. Lying on flat ground between the [[River Mersey]] and the [[Manchester Ship Canal]], it is {{convert|3.8|mi|km|1|lk=on}} to the southwest of [[Manchester City Centre]], {{convert|3.0|mi|km|1}} south-southwest of [[Salford]] and {{convert|4.2|mi|km|1}} northeast of [[Altrincham]]. Stretford is contiguous with the towns of [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] to the east, [[Urmston]] to the west, [[Salford]] to the north, and [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] to the south. The [[Bridgewater Canal]] bisects the town.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], during much of the 19th century Stretford was an agricultural  village known locally as Porkhampton; a reference to the large number of pigs produced for the nearby Manchester market. It was also an extensive market gardening area, producing over {{convert|500|LT|t|0|lk=on}} of vegetables each week for sale in Manchester by 1845. The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park|Trafford Park Industrial Estate]] in the north of the town, accelerated the industrialisation which began in the late 19th century. By 2001, less than 1% of the population of Stretford was employed in agriculture.

Stretford has been the home of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United Football Club]] since 1910, and of the [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] since 1864. Notable residents have included the industrialist and philanthropist [[John Rylands]], the [[Suffragette|sufragette]] [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], the painter [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Morrissey]] of [[The Smiths]], and [[Jay Kay]] of [[Jamiroquai]].

==History==
The origin of the name Stretford is "[[street]]" ([[Old English]] ''straet'') on a ford across the [[River Mersey]].<ref>Nicolaisen, Gelling & Richards, ''The Names of Towns and Cities in Britain'', p.&nbsp;177.</ref> The principal road through Stretford, the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], follows the line of the old [[Roman road]] from [[Deva Victrix]] ([[Chester]]) to [[Mamucium]] ([[Manchester]]), crossing the Mersey into Stretford at Crossford Bridge, built at the location of the ancient ford.<ref name="TownshipsStretford">{{cite web |title=Townships: Stretford |work=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), p. 329&ndash;335 |publisher=British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41436 |accessdate=2007-04-07}}</ref>

In 1212, there were two [[manorialism|manors]] in the area now called Stretford. The land in the south, close to the River Mersey, was held by [[Hamon de Massey|Hamon de Mascy]], while the land in the north, closer to the [[River Irwell]], was held by Henry de&nbsp;Trafford.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;12.</ref> In about 1250, a later Hamon de&nbsp;Mascy gave the Stretford manor to his daughter, Margery. She in turn, in about 1260, granted Stretford to Richard de Trafford at a rent of one penny. The de&nbsp;Mascy family shortly afterwards released all rights to their lands in Stretford to Henry de&nbsp;Trafford, the Trafford family thus acquiring the whole of Stretford, after which the two manors descended together.<ref name="TownshipsStretford" />

The de Trafford family leased out large parts of the land, much of it to tenants who farmed at subsistence levels. Although there is  known to have been a papermill operating in 1765, the area remained largely rural until the early 20th-century development of [[Trafford Park]] in the north of the town.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;13.</ref> Until then Stretford "remained in the background of daily life in England",<ref name="MastersonCliffp15">Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;15.</ref> except for a brief cameo role during the [[Jacobite rising|Jacobite]] rebellion of 1745, when Crossford Bridge was destroyed by [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s army during its abortive advance on London; the bridge was quickly rebuilt.<ref name="MastersonCliffp15" />

Until the 1820s, one of the main cottage industries in Stretford was the hand weaving of cotton. There were reported at one time to have been 302 handlooms operating in Stretford, providing employment for 780 workers, but by 1826 only four were still being used, as the mechanised cotton mills of nearby Manchester replaced hand weaving looms.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;38.</ref> As Manchester continued to grow, it offered a good and easily accessible market for Stretford's agricultural products, in particular [[rhubarb]], once known locally as Stretford beef. By 1836, [[market gardening]] had become so extensive around Stretford that one writer described it as the "garden of Lancashire".<ref>Scola, ''Feeding the Victorian City: the food supply of Manchester, 1770&ndash;1870'', p.&nbsp;97.</ref> In 1845, over {{convert|500|LT|t|0|lk=on}} of vegetables were being produced each week for the Manchester market.<ref>Scola, ''Feeding the Victorian City: the food supply of Manchester, 1770&ndash;1870'', p.&nbsp;105.</ref> Stretford also became well-known for its pig market and the production of [[black pudding]]s, leading to the village being given the nickname Porkhampton. A local dish, known as Stretford Goose, was made from pork stuffed with sage and onions. During the 1830s, between 800 and 1,000 pigs a week were being slaughtered for Manchester.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;19&ndash;20.</ref>

[[Image:WhiteCityGates.jpg|thumb|left|White City Gates, all that remains of the Royal Botanical Gardens]]
Situated on the border with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live during the middle of the 19th century.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;23.</ref> Large recreation areas were built, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist [[John Dalton]], because the prevailing south-westerly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archive of the Royal Botanical and Horticultural Society of Manchester and the Northern Counties |publisher=The Archives Hub |url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/news/0503rbhs.html |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester 1857, a City of Industry |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/whats-on/art-treasures-in-detail/manchester-1857/ |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of <U+00A3>38,000 to house the 16,000 exhibits.<ref name="MastersonCliffp107" /> The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating [[Victoria of England|Queen Victoria]]'s 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than six&nbsp;months and was attended by more than 4.75&nbsp;million visitors.<ref name="MastersonCliffp107">Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;107&ndash;110.</ref> The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on [[16 June]] [[1928]].<ref>{{cite web |title=White City Track| publisher=UK Running Track Directory |url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=manchester-wc |accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II [[listed building|listed structure]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web |title=Entrance Portal and Lodges to Former White City Greyhound Track |publisher=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=212974 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>

The arrival of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in 1894, and the subsequent development of the [[Trafford Park]] industrial estate in the north of the town &ndash; the first planned industrial estate in the world<ref>Nicholls, ''Trafford Park: The First Hundred Years'', p.&nbsp;xiii.</ref> &ndash; had a substantial effect on the growth of Stretford. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.<ref>{{cite web |title=1901 Census of England and Wales |work=A Vision of Britain Through Time |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/census/table_page.jsp?tab_id=EW1901COU_M12&u_id=10075592&show=DB&min_c=1&max_c=5  |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref><ref>Nevell, ''The Archaeology of Trafford'', p.&nbsp;24.</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of war [[materiel]], including the [[Avro Manchester]] heavy bomber, and the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines used to power both the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]].<ref>Nicholls, ''Trafford Park: The First Hundred Years'', p.&nbsp;103&ndash;104.<br />''The Rolls-Royce Merlin engine was made by Ford, under licence. The factory produced 34,000 engines, and employed 17,316 people.''</ref> That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the [[Manchester Blitz]] of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford (football ground)|Old Trafford football ground]], All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street.<ref>{{cite web | title=All Saints Church | work= Trafford Lifetimes | publisher= Trafford Council | url= http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=2630 |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=St. Hilda's church showing bomb damage | work= Trafford Lifetimes | publisher= Trafford Council | url= http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=2403 |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Bomb damage to the children's library, King Street | work= Trafford Lifetimes | publisher= Trafford Council | url= http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=5428 |accessdate=2007-08-02}}</ref> A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948. The memorial sits over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;156.</ref>

Between 1972 and 1975, what is now the [[B&Q]] store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock theatre and Village discotheque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. [[Led Zeppelin]], [[David Bowie]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Elton John]], [[Hawkwind]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Curved Air]] and [[Lou Reed]] were amongst those who appeared. [[Tangerine Dream]] was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on [[19 October]] [[1975]].<ref name="Hardrock">{{cite web |title=Stretford's 'Hardrock' down memory lane |date=2007-08-03 |first=Simon |last=Greenhalgh |publisher=Messenger Newspapers |url=http://www.messengernewspapers.co.uk/features/traffordthroughtime/display.var.1594782.0.stretfords_hardrock_down_memory_lane.php |accessdate=2008-12-08}}</ref> In more recent years, Lancashire Cricket Club's Old Trafford ground, next door, has provided a concert venue for bands such as [[Angels & Airwaves]], [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Richard Ashcroft]] and [[The Strokes]], with audiences in excess of 40,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/venue/view/745 |title=Old Trafford Cricket Ground music venue |author=Anon |publisher=Drowned in Sound |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/06/19/180606_foo_fighters_feature.shtml |title=Foo Fighters at Old Trafford Cricket Ground - 7/10 |author=Anon |publisher=Drowned in Sound |date=[[2006-06-19]] |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>

===Transport history===
Stretford's growth was fuelled by the transport revolutions of the 18th and especially the 19th century: the Bridgewater Canal reached Stretford in 1761, and the railway in 1849. The completion of the [[Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway]] (MSJAR) in 1849, passing through Stretford, led to the population of the town nearly doubling in a decade, increasing from 4,998 in 1851 to 8,757 by 1861.<ref>Nevell, ''The Archaeology of Trafford'', p.&nbsp;25.</ref>

Situated on the main [[A56 road]] between Chester and Manchester, many people passed through the town, and as the traffic increased, inns were built to provide travellers with stopping places. One of the earliest forms of public transport through Stretford was the [[stagecoach]]; the Angel Hotel, on the present day site of the Bass Drum public house,<ref>{{cite web |title= Bass Drum | work= Trafford Lifetimes |publisher=Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council | url= http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=3342 |accessdate= 2007-07-11}}</ref> was one of the main stopping places in the town.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;40.</ref> The stagecoach service through Stretford is believed to have ended some time in the 1840s, about the time that horse drawn tram cars arrived, in 1845;<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;36,40.</ref> electric trams were introduced in 1902.<ref>{{cite web |title=Historian reviews 1,000 years of town history |publisher=Sale and Altrincham Messenger |url=http://archive.thisistrafford.co.uk/2000/1/6/10109.html |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> After the Second World War the trams were replaced by buses.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Short History of Road Passenger Transport in Greater Manchester |publisher=Greater Manchester's Museum of Transport |url=http://www.gmts.co.uk/history/history.html |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref>

The MSJAR railway line through Stretford was electrified in 1931, and was converted to light rail operation in 1992, becoming part of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] tram network. The first Metrolink tram through Stretford ran on [[15 June]] [[1992]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |publisher=Metrolink |url=http://www.metrolink.co.uk/pdf/past_present_future.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

==Governance==
===Civic history===
[[Image:Stretford Borough Council arms.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Arms of the former Stretford Municipal Borough Council]]Stretford was part of the ancient [[Manchester (ancient parish)|parish of Manchester]], within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref name="Gazetteer" /> Following the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the [[Chorlton-upon-Medlock|Chorlton]] Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester,<ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester Archives and Local Studies: A Guide to Poor Law and Workhouse Records |publisher=Manchester City Council
|url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/downloads/PoorLawRecordsGuide.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref> before transferring to the [[Barton-upon-Irwell]] Poor Law Union in 1849.<ref name="Gazetteer" /> In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;88&ndash;89.</ref> The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy [[Rates (tax)|rates]] to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of [[Stretford Urban District|Stretford Urban District Council]] in 1894,<ref name="Gazetteer" /> as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1894]].

Stretford Urban District became the [[Municipal Borough of Stretford]] in 1933,<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite web |title=Greater Manchester Gazetteer |publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Records Office]] |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazzs.htm |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> giving it [[borough status in the United Kingdom]]. Stretford Borough Council was granted its [[Coat of arms|arms]] on [[20 February]] [[1933]].<ref name="CivicHeraldry" /> The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.<ref name="CivicHeraldry">{{cite web |title=Civic Heraldry of England & Wales  |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/lancs_ob.html |accessdate=2007-05-20}}</ref>

In 1974, as a result of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since [[1 April]] [[1974]], formed part of the [[Trafford|Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]], in [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name="Gazetteer" /> Trafford Town Hall &ndash; previously Stretford Town Hall &ndash; is the administrative centre of Trafford.

===Political representation===
The [[Stretford (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Stretford]] was created in 1885, and existed until 1997, when it was replaced by the present [[Stretford and Urmston (UK Parliament constituency)|constituency of Stretford and Urmston]]. [[Beverley Hughes]], a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], has been the [[Member of Parliament|MP]] since the constituency was created. At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]], Hughes won the seat with a majority of 7,851, representing 51.0% of the vote. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] took 30.4% of the vote, the [[Liberal Democrats]] 14.0%, the [[Respect <U+2013> The Unity Coalition|Respect Party]] 2.5%, and the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] 2.2%.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Stretford and Urmston constituency election results | publisher = Guardian.co.uk | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,,-1347,00.html |accessdate=2007-08-04}}</ref>

Stretford is one of the four major urban areas in Trafford; the other three are [[Altrincham]], [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]] and [[Urmston]]. The area historically known as Stretford, between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in the south, has since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Clifford, Longford, Gorse Hill, and Stretford. Each ward is represented by three local councillors, giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council. The wards elect in thirds on a [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007|four yearly cycle]].<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web |title=Trafford Council Constitution 2007 |author=Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council |publisher=Trafford.gov.uk |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=3B68B710-0F74-46D8-8766-9D41C4B49EC2 |accessdate=2008-01-06}}</ref> As at 2007, all 12 of the councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party.

==Geography==
{{further|[[Geography of Greater Manchester]]}}
[[Image:TraffordAreasStretford.png|thumb|left|The [[Metropolitan Borough of Trafford]], highlighting Stretford in red]]
Stretford occupies an area of {{convert|4.1|sqmi|sqkm|1|lk=on}}, just north of the [[River Mersey]], at {{coor dms|53|26|48|N|2|18|31|W|city}} (53.4466, -2.3086). The area is generally flat, sloping slightly southwards towards the river valley,<ref name="TownshipsStretford" /> and is approximately {{convert|150|ft|m|0}} above sea level at its highest point.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stretford, United Kingdom |work=Global Gazetteer, Version 2.1 |publisher=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc |url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/UK/0/Stretford2.html |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> The most southerly part of Stretford lies within the flood plain of the River Mersey, and so has historically been prone to flooding. A great deal of flood mitigation work has been carried out in the Mersey Valley since the 1970s, with the stretch of the Mersey through Stretford being canalised to speed up the passage of floodwater.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mersey Bank Park and the River Mersey |publisher=Mersey Valley Countryside Warden Service |url=http://www.merseyvalley.org.uk/site/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=55&Itemid=77 |accessdate=2007-07-02}}</ref> Emergency floodbasins have also been constructed, [[Sale Water Park]] being a prominent local example, lying immediately to the south of Stretford.

Stretford comprises the local areas of [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester|Old Trafford]], Gorse Hill, [[Trafford Park]] and Firswood. Its climate is generally [[temperate]], with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK.<ref name="Climate01">{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/areal/uk.html |author=Met Office |title=Annual UK weather averages |publisher=Met Office |date=2007 |accessdate=2007-04-23}}</ref>

Stretford's built environment developed along the A56 road in two separate sections, corresponding to the original two manors. The area in the south, near to the border with Sale, grew around the church of St Matthew &ndash; an old alternative name for the town was Stretford St. Matthew.<ref>{{cite web |title=A vision of Stretford Ch/CP |publisher=A Vision of Britain Through Time |url=http://vision.edina.ac.uk/unit_page.jsp?u_id=10380765 |accessdate=2008-01-10}}</ref> The northern part of Stretford was centred on Old Trafford, with undeveloped countryside separating the two areas. During the 19th century, both sections merged together.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;20&ndash;21.</ref>

The western terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork [[Nico Ditch]] is in Hough Moss, just to the east of Stretford ({{gbmapping|SJ82819491}}); it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century.<ref>Nevell, ''The Archaeology of Trafford'', p.&nbsp;40&ndash;41.</ref>

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents in Stretford was 18% retail and wholesale, 14% property and business services, 13% manufacturing, 12% health and social work, 8% education, 8% transport and communications, 6% construction, 5% finance, 5% public administration and defence, 5% hotels and restaurants, 0.7% energy and water supply, 0.3% agriculture and 5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the town's relatively low percentage of agricultural workers. Many people [[Commuting|commute]] into Stretford; as of the 2001 census, there were 23,595 jobs within the town, compared with the town's 13,399 employed residents.<ref name="Employment" /><ref name="Employed">{{cite web |title=Clifford Ward: Economic Activity (UV28) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941521&c=clifford&d=14&e=16&g=356197&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1197468914829&enc=1&dsFamilyId=107 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}<br /> <U+2022> {{cite web |title=Longford Ward: Economic Activity (UV28) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941516&c=longford&d=14&e=16&g=356356&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1197469394386&enc=1&dsFamilyId=107 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}<br /> <U+2022> {{cite web |title=Talbot Ward: Economic Activity (UV28) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941509&c=talbot&d=14&e=16&g=356600&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1197469563337&enc=1&dsFamilyId=107 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}<br /> <U+2022> {{cite web |title=Stretford Ward: Economic Activity (UV28) |publisher=Office for National Statistics |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&b=5941510&c=stretford&d=14&e=16&g=356566&i=1001x1003x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1197469661335&enc=1&dsFamilyId=107 |accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>

==Landmarks==

===Longford Cinema===
[[Image:LongfordCinema2007640.jpg|thumb|right|Longford Cinema, May 2007]]
Longford Cinema, opposite Stretford Mall, on the eastern side of the [[A56 road|A56 Chester Road]], is perhaps the most visually striking building in the town. Designed by the architect Henry Elder, it was the height of [[Art Deco]] fashion when it was opened by the Mayor of Stretford in 1936. Its unusual "cash register" frontage was intended to symbolise the business aspect of show business.<ref name="Rendellp55">Rendell, ''Cinemas of Trafford'', p.&nbsp;55.</ref>

The building incorporated many modern features, such as sound-proofing and under-seat heating,<ref name="LongfordCinema" /> and it was also the first cinema in Britain to make use of concealed neon lighting.<ref name="Rendellp55" /> It had a seating capacity of {{formatnum:1400}} in the stalls and 600 in the circle, with a further 146 seats in the caf<U+00E9> area.<ref name="Rendellp55" /> When built, the cinema had a short pedestrian approach to the facade, but this was removed when the A56 was widened. During [[World War II]] the building was used for concerts, including one given by a young [[Julie Andrews]].<ref name="LongfordCinema">{{cite web
 |title=Longford Cinema
 |url=http://www.longfordcinema.co.uk/
 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> It also played host to the [[Hall<U+00E9> Orchestra]] after the orchestra's own home, the [[Free Trade Hall]], was bombed and severely damaged during the [[Manchester Blitz]] of 1940.

After a change of ownership in 1950, the cinema was renamed the Stretford Essoldo. It continued to operate as a cinema until 1965, when it was converted into a [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] hall, which it remained until its closure in 1995.<ref name="LongfordCinema" /> The building has remained unused since then. It was designated a  [[Listed building|Grade II listed]] building in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longford Cinema |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=1&id=438795 |accessdate=2007-08-12}}</ref>

===Great Stone===
[[Image:GreatStone640.JPG|thumb|right|The Great Stone]]
The Great Stone, which gave its name to the Great Stone Road, where it was located until being moved in 1925, is one of Stretford's most easily overlooked landmarks. The stone is composed of [[millstone grit]] and was probably deposited as a [[glacial erratic]]. It is rectangular in shape, about {{nowrap|{{convert|5|ft|m|0}}}} wide, {{nowrap|{{convert|2|ft|m|0}}}} deep, and {{nowrap|{{convert|3|ft|m|0}}}} tall, with two rectangular slots cut into its upper surface.

Several suggestions have been made for the history of the Great Stone. It may have been a plague stone, when the holes in the top would have been filled with disinfectant, through which coins exchanged between plague victims and the rest of the population would have been passed. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards,<ref>{{cite web |title=The City and Parish of Manchester |work=A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 |publisher=British History Online |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41404 |accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> but although the stone may then have been used as a plague stone, the holes are probably too deep for that to have been its original purpose. It may have been a road marker on the Roman road between [[Northwich]] and Manchester, or some kind of a boundary marker.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Cross, Streford |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=76747 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk |accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref> The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft.<ref name="NevellArchaeologyTraffordp87" />  A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its final disappearance would mark the end of the world.<ref>Massey, ''A History of Stretford'', p.&nbsp;25.</ref>

When the Great Stone Road was widened in the late 19th century, the stone was moved back from the road slightly. In 1925, the stone was moved again, to its current location outside the North Lodge of Gorse Hill Park, about {{convert|328|ft|m|0}} from its historical location. The stone is a Grade II listed structure.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Great Stone Stretford |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=212976 | accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

===Cenotaph===
[[Image:Cenotaph640.jpg|thumb|right|Stretford Cenotaph]]
Stretford Cenotaph, opposite the Chester Road entrance to Gorse Hill Park, was built as a memorial to the 580 Stretford men who lost their lives in the [[First World War]]. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the wall behind the cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]], Secretary of State for War.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stretford Cenotaph |work=National Recording Project |publisher=Public Monument and Sculpture Association |url=http://pmsa.cch.kcl.ac.uk/MR/MR-TRA13.htm |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

The cenotaph is {{convert|24|ft|m|0}} high and {{convert|11|ft|m|0}} wide at its base. It cost <U+00A3>2,000 to build, the money being raised by public subscription and a donation from the Stretford Red Cross. The memorial bears the legend "They died that we might live" on one side, and "In memory of the heroic dead" on the other. It is a Grade II listed structure.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stretford Cenotaph |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=212971 | accessdate=2008-01-08}}</ref>

===Longford Park===
Longford Park is the largest park in Trafford, at {{convert|54|acre|ha|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Longford Park |publisher=Trafford Metropolitan Borough |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/cme1814.htm |accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> It includes a pet's corner, [[botanical garden]], bowling greens and children's play areas. It is also the finishing point of the annual Stretford pageant. Longford Park was the home of [[John Rylands]], industrialist and philanthropist, from 1855 until his death in 1888.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;73.</ref> The hall was demolished in 1995. Today only the front porch, the coach house and the stable buildings remain.

===Public Hall===
Stretford Public Hall was built in 1878 by local philanthropist [[John Rylands]].<ref name="Masterson&Cliffp83">Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;83.</ref> It was designed by N. Lofthouse and is located on the western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford<U+2019>s first public lending library was established in the building in 1883.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;118.</ref> At Ryland's death in 1888, his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1910, the building was bought by Stretford Council for <U+00A3>5,000.<ref name="Masterson&Cliffp83" />

Public baths were built to the rear of the building, accessed via Cyprus Street.<ref>{{cite web  |title=Stretford Baths | publisher=Trafford Council|url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=4723 |accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref> In 1940 the new Stretford library was opened on King Street, and the public hall was rendered surplus. The building re-opened in March 1949 as the Stretford Civic Theatre, with a well equipped stage for the use of local groups. After the Stretford Leisure Centre opened in 1976, the Cyprus Street Baths wing fell into disuse, and was demolished. The remainder of the building began to fall into disrepair, despite being designated a Grade II listed building in 1987,<ref>{{cite web |title=Stretford Civic Theatre |work=Images of England |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=212970 |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref> until Trafford Council refurbished and converted the building to serve as council offices in the mid-1990s. It was re-opened in 1997, once again named Stretford Public Hall.

===Trafford Town Hall===
Trafford Town Hall stands in a large site at the junction of Talbot Road and Warwick Road, directly opposite the [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]]. The building was designed by architects Bradshaw, Gass and Hope of Bolton and the contractors were Edwin Marshall & Sons Ltd. Building work began [[21 August]] [[1931]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Stretford Town Hall | publisher=Trafford Council|url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/content/tca/display_image.asp?ImageID=4545 |accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

The building officially came into use as Stretford Town Hall on the granting of Stretford's charter, on [[16 September]] [[1933]]. In 1974, on the formation of the new Trafford Metropolitan Borough, Stretford Town Hall was adopted as the base for the new council, and was renamed Trafford Town Hall. It was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=Listings report, Autumn 2007 |publisher=The Twentieth Century Society |url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/listings/07_autumn.html |accessdate=2007-12-06}}</ref>

==Transport==

The containers are handled by two huge gantry cranes, the noise from which has led to complaints from some local residents.<ref>Nicholls, ''Trafford Park: The First Hundred Years'', p.&nbsp;161.</ref>

The town has good access to the [[motorway]] network; junction 7 of the [[M60 motorway|M60]] is just to the north of Stretford's boundary with [[Sale, Greater Manchester|Sale]]. The [[A56 road]] gives easy access to the south as well as to [[Manchester city centre]] in the other direction. Cycle paths exist as part of the Trafford cycle initiative.

The date of the first church to be built in Stretford is unrecorded, but in a lease dated 1413, land is described as lying next to a chapel.<ref name="TownshipsStretford" /> Many of the present day churches in the area were constructed during the late 19th and early 20th century, as the population of Stretford began to grow.

[[Methodism]] was a significant influence in 19th-century Stretford,<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;11.</ref> but of the 17 churches in the town today, only one is Methodist whereas six are [[Roman Catholic]]. The Catholic mission in Stretford was begun in 1859, in a small chapel on Herbert Street.<ref>Massey, ''A History of Stretford'', p.&nbsp;126.</ref>

As at the 2001 UK census, 65% of Stretford residents reported themselves as being Christian, 12% as [[Muslim]], and 2% as [[Sikh]]. No other religion was represented at higher than 1% of the population, with 12% reporting themselves as having no religion.

[[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] was originally the home of [[Manchester Cricket Club]], but became the home of [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] in 1864 upon that club's formation. The ground is on Talbot Road, Stretford, where it has been since 1856. Similar to its counterpart, one end of the Old Trafford cricket ground is called the Stretford End. It has been a test venue since 1884 and has hosted three [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] semi-finals.<ref name="Old Trafford Cricket Ground 150">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6637911.stm |title=Cricket ground makes 150 not out |author=Anon |publisher=BBC Online |date=[[2007-05-09]] |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> After the 2005 Ashes Test, when more than 20,000 fans had to be turned away,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/04/21/210406_ashes_old_trafford_reaction_feature.shtml |title=Ashes to Ashes |author=Anon |publisher=BBC Online |date=[[2006-04-21]] |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref> the decision was made to increase the ground's capacity from 20,000 to 25,000. Initial plans included building a new stadium on the site of Trafford Town Hall, opposite the present ground. However, Trafford Council voted against the demolition of the town hall and instead, in 2007, signed an agreement jointly with Lancashire County Cricket Club, Ask Developments, and [[Tesco]], to redevelop the ground on its present site.<ref name="FourWayAgreement" />[[Image:LCCC Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Lancashire CCC - main entrance]] The new cricket ground will be at the heart of a {{convert|750000|sqft|sqm|0}} development which will also include business space, residential, retail, hotel and leisure facilities.

The Stretford Leisure Centre, run by Trafford Community Leisure Trust, is next to Stretford High School and near to Old Trafford football and cricket grounds. The centre has a 25-metre pool, a 20-metre children's pool, a gym, two squash courts, eight badminton courts and a cafe. [[Sale Water Park|Trafford Water Sports Centre]] lies just across Stretford's southern border with Sale, about one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from Stretford town centre.

Although Stretford town centre is busy during the day, there is very little in the way of a night-time economy.<ref name="ProfileStretford">{{cite web |title=Stretford Ward Profile |publisher=Trafford Council |url=http://www.trafford.gov.uk/cme/live/dynamic/DocMan2Document.asp?document_id=6C022A5E-3653-424B-AF38-0F34BF8C3228 |accessdate=2007-05-08 }}</ref> There are no restaurants or other entertainments except for a number of [[public houses]] and members-only social clubs. There are two public libraries, Lostock Library and Stretford Library, run by Trafford Council.

The Stretford Pageant is an annual Rose Queen festival held on the last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919.<ref>Masterson and Cliff, ''Stretford: An Illustrated History'', p.&nbsp;115.</ref> There is a procession of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in the park on the day of the pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brassed off over Festival Funding |first=Katherine |last=Vine |publisher=Manchester Metro News |date=2007-10-26 |url=http://www.metronews.co.uk/news/s/1021623_brassed_off_over_festival_funding |accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>

===Invention and discovery===

The [[Stretford process]] was developed at the North-Western Gas Board's laboratories in Stretford, during the 1940s. It was the first liquid phase, oxidation process for removing hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from town gas to gain widespread commercial acceptance. Many Stretford plants were built worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |authorlast=Nagl |authorfirst=Gary J |title=The State of Liquid Redox |work=Gas Technology Products |publisher=Merichem Company |date=2005 |url=http://www.gtp-merichem.com/support/technical_papers/liquid_redox.php |accessdate=2007-05-23}}</ref>
