== Biography ==
Lt Col Lebed joined the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] in 1981 starting his military service in [[Soviet Airborne Troops]] ({{lang-ru|<U+0412><U+043E><U+0437><U+0434><U+0443><U+0448><U+043D><U+043E>-<U+0434><U+0435><U+0441><U+0430><U+043D><U+0442><U+043D><U+044B><U+0435> <U+0432><U+043E><U+0439><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430>}}).  Opting for a career change, he entered the Lomonosov Military Aviation Technical School graduating as a [[flight engineer]] in 1986.  He served in [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in 1986-87 serving in a helicopter regiment on combat operations.

After his return from Afghanistan, he served successively in the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany]], in the [[Transbaikal Military District|Trans-Baikal]] and [[Siberian Military District|Siberian]] military districts in the 329th Transport & Combat Helicopter Regiment and in the 337th Independent Helicopter Regiment.

He retired to the reserves in 1994 having earned the [[Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR|Order "For Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces"]] 3rd class and three [[Order of the Red Star|Orders of the Red Star]], and worked for the Afghan Veterans benevolent fund.

In 1999, he went to the [[North Caucasus]] as a volunteer in the combined militias after purchasing his own equipment and flying to [[Makhachkala]] in [[Dagestan]].  When military ops moved into [[Chechnya]], he went to Moscow and re upped in the service and got back to the fighting.  In 2003, while engaged in combat in the [[Battle for Height 776|Ulus-Kert]] mountains, he stepped on a mine and lost a foot. His superior physical fitness allowed him to remain in the service with a prosthesis. In a subsequent battle, he was injured by multiple fragment wounds in the back while shielding his men from the blast of a rocket propelled grenade. Even wounded he continued leading the patrol leading to the capture and destruction of a terrorist base.

He was awarded the Title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]] on April 6, 2005 by [[Presidential Decree]] citing "for courage and heroism in the performance of military duties in the North Caucasus"<ref name="2005 decree">{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of May 5, 2005  | publisher = Site of the President of the Russian Federation <U+2013> Kremlin News | date= 2005-05-05 | url = http://archive.kremlin.ru/text/docs/2005/05/87536.shtml| format = HTML | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-24 }}</ref>. He then held the rank of captain.

His actions during the [[2008 South Ossetia war]] earned him the honour of becoming only the second Knight of the [[Order of St. George]] 4th class<ref name="2008 decree">{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of October 1, 2008  | publisher = Site of the President of the Russian Federation <U+2013> Kremlin News | date= 2008-10-01 | url = http://archive.kremlin.ru/text/docs/2008/10/207082.shtml | format = HTML | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-24 }}</ref>.
