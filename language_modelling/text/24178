'''S9''', '''SB8''', '''SM9''' are [[Paralympic sports#Classification|disability swimming classifications]] used for categorising swimmers based on their level of disability.

==History==
The classification was created by the [[International Paralympic Committee]]  and has roots in a 2003 attempt to address "the overall objective to support and co-ordinate the ongoing development of accurate, reliable, consistent and credible sport focused classification systems and their implementation."<ref name=ipc-2003>{{cite web|publisher=International Paralympic Committee|title=Paralympic Classification Today|page=3|accessdate=18 November 2011|date=22 April 2010}}</ref> In 1997, ''Against the odds : New Zealand Paralympians'' said this classification was graded along a gradient, with S1 being the most disabled and S10 being the least disabled.  At this time, competitors who were S9 classified tended to be above the elbow or above the knee amputees.<ref name=nzbook-18>{{Cite book|page=18|title=Against the odds : New Zealand Paralympians|first=Alison|last=Gray|location=Auckland, N.Z.|publisher=Hodder Moa Beckett|date=1997|isbn=1869585666 |oclc=154294284}}</ref>

SB means breaststroke. SM means individual medley.<ref name=understanding/> Jane Buckley, writing for the [[Sporting Wheelies]], describes the swimmers in this classification as having: "severe weakness in one leg only; Swimmers with very slight coordination problems; Swimmers with one limb loss. Unless there is an underlying medical condition usually all of these athletes will start out of the water."<ref name="understanding"/>  Swimming classifications are on a gradient, with one being the most severely physically impaired to ten having the least amount of physical disability.<ref name=expalanmation>{{cite web|last=Shackell |first=James |url=http://www.maroondahweekly.com.au/news/local/news/general/paralympic-dreams-croydon-hills-teen-a-hotshot-in-pool/2632869.aspx |title=Paralympic dreams: Croydon Hills teen a hotshot in pool |publisher=Maroondah Weekly |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>
