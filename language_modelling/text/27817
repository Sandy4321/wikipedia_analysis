The {{nihongo|'''''Sakawa'''''|<U+9152><U+5302> <U+8EFD><U+5DE1><U+6D0B><U+8266>|Sakawa keijun'y<U+014D>kan}} was an [[Agano class|''Agano'' class]] [[light cruiser]] which served with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. It was named after a river in [[Kanagawa prefecture]], [[Japan]].  She may be best known for her use as an atomic bomb target at [[Bikini atomic experiments|Bikini Atoll]].

==Background==
''Sakawa'' was the fourth and final of the four vessels completed in the ''Agano''-class of [[light cruiser]]s, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a [[destroyer]] flotilla.

==Service career==

===Imperial Japanese Navy===
''Sakawa'' was completed on 30 November 1944 at [[Sasebo Navy Yard]] and was assigned to the [[Combined Fleet]] at [[Yokosuka]]. On 15 January 1945 ''Sakawa'' became [[flagship]] of DesRon 11, training with new destroyers in the [[Seto Inland Sea|Inland Sea]] and participating in a series of tests of a new anti-radar submarine coating. 

On 1 April 1945, ''Sakawa'' was assigned to the Second Fleet for "[[Operation Ten-Go]]", the suicide mission against the American invasion forces at [[Okinawa]]. ''Sakawa'' was originally scheduled to accompany [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] with her [[sister ship]] [[Japanese cruiser Yahagi (1942)|''Yahagi'']], but there was no fuel available for ''Sakawa'' and her destroyer squadron. After the loss of ''Yamato'', ''Sakawa'' was reassigned back to the Combined Fleet.

At the time of the [[surrender of Japan]] on 2 September 1945, ''Sakawa'' was at [[Maizuru, Kyoto|Maizuru]], having never once been in combat.

On 5 October 1945, well after the war ended, ''Sakawa'' was officially removed from the Navy List.

===United States Navy===
''Sakawa'' was taken as a [[prize of war]] by the United States after the conclusion of [[World War II]], and was used to evacuate 1,339 [[Imperial Japanese Army]] troops stranded on four small islands in the southern [[Palau]] group in October 1945. It continued to work for the Repatriation Service as a transport until the end of February 1946.

On 25 February 1946, Sakawa was turned over to the [[USN|US Navy]], which wanted to use it (along with other surviving ships of the former Imperial Japanese Navy) in the upcoming [[Bikini atomic experiments]]. The salvage crew found the leaky hull infested with rats, and that most of the ship's systems were not functional. ''Sakawa'' departed Yokosuka for [[Eniwetok]] with an American crew of 165 men and officers on 18 March 1946, accompanied by [[Japanese battleship Nagato|''Nagato'']], also under an American crew. Ten days later, {{convert|300|nmi|km|-1}} from Eniwetok, ''Nagato'' broke down.  It blew a boiler and started to take on water, listing heavily to the starboard. ''Sakawa'' attempted to tow, but then ran out of fuel. An oil tanker, ''Nickajack Trail'' was diverted to refuel the ships, but ran aground on a reef in bad weather and was lost. ''Sakawa'' and ''Nagato'', under tow, finally reached Eniwetok on 1 April 1946.

While at Eniwetok, five of its American sailors were angry over the dismal working conditions aboard ''Sakawa''. In a ship normally staffed by 730 men, the U.S. Navy used a crew of 165 doing the work of 325.<ref>[http://www.aracnet.com/~pdxavets/sabotage.htm Vasco]</ref> The five sailors sabotaged the ship by removing the pressure line to the over-speed trip valves in the fuel system and pouring sand into the oil and water pumps. They smashed gauges, tachometers, and cut high pressure steam lines in an attempt to get relieved of duty aboard the filthy warship. Rather than being relieved of duty, the five sailors were brought up on charges. In May, after emergency repairs, ''Sakawa'' reached [[Bikini Atoll]].

During [[Operation Crossroads]] on 1 July 1946, ''Sakawa'' and ''Nagato'' were the primary target ships in the [[atomic bomb]] air burst detonation test "[[ABLE (nuclear weapon)|Able]]", together with American battleships [[USS Arkansas (BB-33)|''USS Arkansas'']], [[USS New York (BB-34)|''USS New York'']], [[USS Nevada (BB-36)|''USS Nevada'']], and [[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''USS Pennsylvania'']]. ''Sakawa'' was moored off the port side of ''Nevada'', where the bomb was to be dropped. The detonation of the ''Able'' bomb occurred {{convert|490|yd|m|-1}} above and slightly to starboard of ''Sakawa's'' stern. The blast caused ''Sakawa'' to burn fiercely for twenty-four hours; the force crushed her superstructure, damaged her hull and breached her stern. After the test, a [[tug boat]], the [[USS Achomawi|USS ''Achomawi'']], tried to tow ''Sakawa'' toward a beach to prevent the latter ship from sinking, but failed. ''Sakawa'' started sinking almost as soon as towing began, and, with a tow cable connecting the two ships, the ''Achomawi'' started to be dragged down, too. After a number of attempts, sailors cut the tow cable with an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting|acetylene]] torch. ''Sakawa'' sank 2 July 1946, with a portion of the tow cable still attached.

The second weapons test, ''Baker'', was an underwater shot about {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} away from the sunken ''Sakawa''.
