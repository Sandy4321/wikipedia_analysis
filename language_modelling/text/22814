Brother '''Richard Scott Withers''' (born 1955) is an American [[Consecrated life|consecrated]] [[hermit]]. In 1974, Withers converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and was [[Baptism|baptized]]; shortly after, he started to live a religious life. In 1989, Withers and Sister [[Margaret McKenna]] moved to inner city Philadelphia and founded New Jerusalem Laura, a drug treatment center. Withers petitioned the [[Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] to become a consecrated hermit several times but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal [[Anthony Bevilacqua]], the [[Archbishop of Philadelphia]]. He was the first hermit to be consecrated in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Withers lives in a hermitage, a converted rowhouse, in the city of Philadelphia where he spends most of his time in prayer.

==Early life==
Withers was born in California's [[San Fernando Valley]]. He had seven siblings and his father was a mechanical engineer. Neither of his parents were practicing Catholics during his childhood. His father had been raised Catholic but then "lapsed".<ref name=Remsen01>{{harvnb|Remsen|2001}}</ref> Instead, he was raised [[Jewish culture|culturally Jewish]] according to the faith of his mother.<ref name=Niebuhr01>{{harvnb|Niebuhr|2001}}</ref> When Withers was eight, his family moved to [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]], [[New Jersey]]. In 1974, he had an encounter with a group of Catholic activists at the bicycle repair shop where he worked, which caused him to convert to Catholicism and be [[baptized]]. The same year, Withers left home for nearby [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], New Jersey, to [[squatting|live in]] and repair abandoned [[row house]]s.<ref name=Clark97>{{harvnb|Clark|1997}}</ref>

==Religious life==
After his baptism, Withers lived in a loosely-affiliated religious community. While there, Withers almost got married but decided that he wanted to live a religious life instead.<ref name=Moore01>{{harvnb|Moore|2001}}</ref> In 1984, he took private vows of "poverty, chastity, and obedience" and became a hermit. Before taking his vows, Withers had looked into several religious orders, but he could not find one that he felt compatible with.<ref name=Remsen01 /> Passionate about the spirituality of the [[Desert Fathers]], he and Sister [[Margaret McKenna]] debated about "Where is the desert today?"<ref name=Schenk14/> Deciding it was in the abandoned [[inner city|inner cities]], in 1989 they moved into an abandoned row house that they began restoring, continuing their work even when their tools were regularly stolen by drug addicts.<ref name=Schenk14>{{harvnb|Schenk|2014}}</ref> There, they founded New Jerusalem Laura, a treatment center for drug addicts.<ref name=Thompson09>{{harvnb|Thompson|2009}}</ref>

Two years later, in 1991, Withers bought a derelict [[terraced house#United States|rowhouse]] from the city of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna.<ref name=Clark97 /> This would become his [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]. He fixed the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build furniture for it by himself. After the 1983 revision of [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Canon 603]], the option of being a consecrated hermit while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, Withers attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected.<ref name=Niebuhr01 /> In 2001, Withers was finally approved and consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal [[Anthony Bevilacqua]] and took his public vows.<ref name=Niebuhr01 /> Withers was the first hermit to be consecrated by the Archdiocese.<ref name=Remsen01 />

===Life as a hermit===
As a hermit, Withers lives in solitude. He does not own a car or television; he gets his news from the people around him and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, on the side of the road.<ref name=Clark97 /> Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email.<ref name="Remsen01" /> To earn his food and clothing allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, Withers makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company.<ref>{{harvnb|Moore|2001}} & {{harvnb|Remsen|2001}}</ref> At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to the poor.

Withers wakes up at 5 AM and then fills his day with prayer and chores, following his rule of life.<ref name=Niebuhr01 />  He prays for 4<U+00BD> hours each day.<ref name="Moore01" />  Withers claims that "it's in the solitude that I hear God best".<ref name=Niebuhr01 />
