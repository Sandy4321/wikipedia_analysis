Captain '''John Carr''' is a lawyer, and an officer in the [[United States]] military.
Carr, Major [[Robert Preston (military lawyer)|Robert Preston]] and [[USAF]] Captain [[Carrie Wolf (military lawyer)|Carrie Wolf]] were among the military lawyers
tasked to serve as prosecutors of the suspected terrorists imprisoned at the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]].  Carr, Preston and Wolf all requested transfers to other assignments because they had concerns that the proceedings would be innately unjust.

On August 1, 2005, the [[Australia]]n newspaper, [[The Age]] published an article based on the leaked memos, and quoted Carr's:[http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200508/s1426797.htm]

:''When I volunteered to assist with this process and was assigned to this office, I expected there would at least be a minimal effort to establish a fair process and diligently prepare cases against significant accused.''

:''Instead, I find a half-hearted and disorganised effort by a skeleton group of relatively inexperienced attorneys to prosecute fairly low-level accused in a process that appears to be rigged.''

:''You have repeatedly said to the office that the military panel will be handpicked and will not acquit these detainees and that we only needed to worry about building a record for the review panel.''

Although Brigadier General [[Thomas Hemingway]], a legal advisor to the [[Office of Military Commissions]], tried to dismiss the memos as based on simple misunderstandings.  There was an official investigation, following which the Chief Prosecutor to whom the memos were addressed, subsequently resigned from the military.
