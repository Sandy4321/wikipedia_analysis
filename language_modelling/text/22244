'''Anne Hampton Brewster''' (October 29, 1818 <U+2013> 1892) was one of America's first female foreign correspondents, publishing primarily in Philadelphia, New York and Boston newspapers.  She also published novels and numerous short stories. 

She was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], on October 29, 1818, to Maria Hampton and Francis Enoch Brewster.

She was a "social outlaw" (as a friend described her) by refusing to marry, by converting to Catholicism, by moving out of the house of older brother, [[Benjamin H. Brewster]] (who later served as [[United States Attorney General]] in the 1880s), in order to live alone, by moving to Rome, and, foremost, by continuing to write through it all, first as a dilettante and then as a self-supporting professional.<ref name="lara">Larrabee, Denise M.

Brewster died in Italy in 1892, and left her writings and books to the Library Company of Philadelphia.<ref name="lara"/><ref name="books">(6 May 1892).
