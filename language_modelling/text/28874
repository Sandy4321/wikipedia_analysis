Gatti participated in ''[[Ring Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''"[[Ring_Magazine_fights_of_the_year#1990s|fight of the year]]"'' a total of four times (1997, 1998, 2002, and 2003). He announced his retirement on July 14, 2007.<ref name="cbc01">{{cite web |title=Boxer Arturo Gatti found dead |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/07/11/gatt-dead.html |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[CBC News]]''}}</ref>

== Professional career ==

Arturo Gatti was a member of the [[Canada at the Olympics|Canadian National team]], and was training to represent Canada at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Games]], but at age 19 (in 1991), he decided to turn pro instead.<ref name="tsn01"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Hard-hitting Arturo Gatti was one of Canada's boxing greats |url=http://www.inews880.com/News/Sports/Article.aspx?id=125161 |date= July 11, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Canadian Press]]''}}</ref> He began boxing professionally on the night of June 10, 1991, with a third round knockout of [[Jose Gonzalez]] in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]]. He went undefeated for six bouts before losing to [[King Solomon (boxer)|King Solomon]] by split decision in six rounds on November 17, 1992.

His next fight, on March 23, 1993, was his first fight abroad, where he visited [[Amsterdam, Netherlands|Amsterdam]] and knocked out [[Plawen Goutchev]] in round one.

1994 was a year when Gatti stepped up his quality of opposition. He started by beating [[Leon Bostic]], and followed through with a win over [[Pete Taliaferro]] to win the [[United States Boxing Association|USBA]] [[super featherweight]] title, by a knockout in round one. He retained the title against [[Richard Salazar]] and [[Jose Sanabria]].

=== Signing with HBO ===
On December 15, 1995, Gatti challenged the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]'s world super featherweight champion, [[Floyd Patterson]]'s adoptive son [[Tracy Harris Patterson]]. Gatti became world champion when he narrowly outpointed Patterson (scoring: 116<U+2013>111, 115<U+2013>112, 114<U+2013>113), and signed a multi-fight deal with [[Home Box Office|HBO]] to fight on [[HBO Boxing]].

He only had 2 fights in 1996, once defending his world title. But his title defense, at [[Madison Square Garden]] against [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Wilson Rodriguez]] was the first of three Gatti fights in a row to be named a candidate for "fight of the year" by ''[[Ring Magazine]]''. Dropped in round two and with his right eye closing fast, Gatti knocked down Rodriguez in round five with a left hook to the body, before finishing him off in round six to retain the title.

In 1997, he again won a points victory over Patterson but this time by a larger margin (118<U+2013>108, 117<U+2013>109, 116<U+2013>110). He then scored a technical knockout over former world champion [[Calvin Grove]] in round seven of a non-title affair. Then came his defense against former world champion [[Gabriel Ruelas]], which was also named "fight of the year" by Ring Magazine. Rocked by a left uppercut in the fourth, Gatti absorbed more than 15 consecutive punches before being saved by the bell. In the fifth, he connected on a left hook to knock Ruelas out.

=== To the lightweight division ===

After that fight, Gatti chose to relinquish the world title, going up in weight to the lightweight division. However, 1998 was a bad year for Gatti, as he lost all three of his fights that year. He lost by a technical knockout in round eight to [[Angel Manfredy]], and then lost a pair of close decisions in 10 rounds to [[Ivan Robinson]]. Gatti-Robinson I was chosen "fight of the year" by ''Ring Magazine'', thus marking the second year in a row that a Gatti fight was given that award, and the third year in a row a Gatti fight was nominated.

He only had one fight in 1999, knocking out [[Reyes Munoz]] in round one.

=== Controversial fight against Gamache ===

Gatti's first fight of 2000 proved to be controversial. Faced with former world champion [[Joey Gamache]], Gatti won by a knockout in round two. A subsequent lawsuit by Gamache's handlers claimed Gatti had gained 19 pounds since the weigh-in the day before and thus had a large advantage over Gamache.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boxer suing Gatti |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/other_sports/boxing/articles/2006/03/03/boxer_suing_gatti/ |date= March 3, 2006 |publisher=''[[Associated Press|AP]]''}}</ref>  In the wake of the fight boxing regulators pushed for a new law limiting the amount of weight a competitor can gain between the weigh-in and time of the fight.  Gatti was also accused by Gamache's handlers of not having actually made the contracted weight of 141 pounds. After Gatti-Gamache, some boxing commissions started weighing boxers a second time.

Gatti also won his two other fights that year.

=== Trilogy against Micky Ward ===
In 2001, Gatti only had one fight, going up in weight to meet [[welterweight]] [[Oscar de la Hoya]], who beat him by a technical knockout in five rounds.  In 2002, Gatti returned to the junior welterweight division and defeated former world champion [[Terronn Millett]]  by a knockout in round four.

He then split two ten round decisions with "Irish" [[Micky Ward]], losing their first bout, but winning their second. Gatti-Ward I also garnered "fight of the year" honors by [[Ring Magazine]].

On June 7, 2003, he and Ward had a [[rubber match]]. Gatti broke his twice-repaired right hand on an uppercut to the hip in the fourth, and he dropped his arm, wincing in pain. He fought nearly one-handed for several rounds afterward, using his right sparingly. In the sixth, Gatti dominated the round but got caught with an overhand right to the top of the head a second before the bell rang and went down. Gatti then recovered again and was never in trouble after that. The final scorecards read, 96<U+2013>93 (twice), and 97<U+2013>92, in favor of Gatti. The third fight between the two was again named "[[fight of the year]]" by Ring Magazine.

=== Career after Micky Ward ===

On January 24, 2004, Gatti also recovered from a broken hand, scored a tenth round knock-down and defeated Gianluca Branco of [[Italy]] by a twelve round unanimous decision to win the vacant [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] junior welterweight title.

On July 24, 2004, he knocked out the previously unbeaten former world champion [[Leonard Dorin]] in two rounds at Atlantic City, to retain his title. It should be noted that Dorin was dropped with one single body shot.

Gatti's second defense of his WBC title came against former world junior lightweight champion [[Jesse James Leija]] on January 29, 2005. Gatti beat Leija by a fifth round knockout.

In his next fight, Gatti fought former [[super featherweight]] and [[lightweight]] world champion [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]] on June 25, 2005. He took several hard punches to the gut and Gatti's corner threw in the towel after taking a strong body shot, thus ending his title reign via sixth-round technical knockout.

After the loss to Mayweather, Gatti moved up to the welterweight division. He beat Thomas Damgaard on January 28, 2006, by an eleventh round technical knockout to win the vacant [[IBA]] Welterweight title.

On July 22, 2006, Gatti was knocked out by [[Carlos Baldomir]] vying for the world welterweight Championship.  He then broke off his relationship with [[Buddy McGirt]] and had a new trainer in Micky Ward.

Gatti attempted a comeback on July 14, 2007 against [[Alfonso Gomez]], only to get KO'd in seven rounds. After the fight Gatti announced his retirement in the dressing room, reportedly quipping: "I'll be back<U+2014>as a spectator".

== Post-career ==

Gatti retired with a record of 40 wins and 9 losses, with 31 wins by knockout. On September 24, 2008 reports had surfaced that Gatti was considering a comeback against Montreal welterweight [[Antonin Decarie]] (19<U+2013>0), the Canadian and North American Boxing Organization champion. In March 2009, Gatti was charged with assaulting his then girlfriend Amanda Rodrigues, but failed to appear in court. When he appeared April 17, he was released on bail and was ordered to stay 200 meters from Rodrigues.<ref>{{cite web |title=Montreal boxer Arturo Gatti mourned as legend |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/travel/Montreal+boxer+Arturo+Gatti+dead/1782665/story.html |date= July 12, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]''}}</ref>
