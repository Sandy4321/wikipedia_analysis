'''David J. Howe''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] writer, journalist, publisher, and media historian.
==Biography==
David Howe was born August 24, 1961 and established himself (in the early 1980s) as an authoritative media historian through writing articles for [[fanzine]]s (notably ''The Frame'') and other publications. In the early 1990s, he began to write the first in-depth critical texts of the British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and as a result has become closely associated with the show's history.<ref name="kasterborous" /><ref name="nzdwf">{{cite web |url=http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv54/davidjhowe.html |title=David J Howe |last1=Scoones |first1=Paul |date=March 1998 |website=Time Space Visualiser |publisher=New Zealand Doctor Who Fan Club |accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref> He has written or co-written over thirty titles about the show, and continues to be involved with a variety of publications, often acting as consultant or reviewer.

In particular, Howe collaborated on some of the key texts in [[Virgin Publishing]]'s range of ''Doctor Who'' reference works, including the three ''Decades'' books (with [[Stephen James Walker]] and [[Mark Stammers]]), considered to be some of the most in-depth works about the production history of the show.<ref name="kasterborous">{{cite web |title=David J Howe |website=Kasterborous.com |last=Whittington |first=James |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2009/11/01/david-j-howe/ |accessdate=1 May 2013 |date=1 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="nzdwf" /><ref>{{cite book |last=O'Day |first=Andrew |editor-last=Leitch |editor-first=Gillian |title=Doctor Who in Time and Space: Essays on Themes, Characters, History and Fandom, 1963<U+2013>2012 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=pHugbjdJWwwC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=david+howe+doctor+who#v=onepage&q=david%20howe&f=false |accessdate=1 May 2013 |year=2013 |chapter=Event TV: Fan Consumption of Televised ''Doctor Who'' in Britain (1963<U+2013>Present) |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |isbn=9780786465491 |pages=7, 22}}</ref> The same authors followed these with guide books which covered the individual tenures of each Doctor in turn.<ref name="nzdwf" />

Howe and Stephen James Walker set up the publishing house [[Telos Publishing]] in 2000. The first publication under the Telos name was the first edition of ''Howe's Transcendental Toybox'', written by Howe and Arnold T. Blumberg.<ref name="scifi">{{cite web |url=http://www.sci-fi-online.com/Interview/03-07-30_DavidJHowe.htm |title=Interview: David Howe |last1=Rea |first1=Darren |date=30 July 2003 |website=sci-fi online |publisher= |accessdate=6 May 2013}}

Howe also wrote ''Daemos Rising'', an original film directed by Keith Barnfarther.<ref name="kasterborous" /> He also wrote a story for the first [[Virgin Decalog]] [[short story]] collection, his only piece of licensed ''Doctor Who'' fiction to be published. He continues to work as co-director of Telos Publishing, which has expanded to publish a wide range of classic and new science fiction stories. In 2011 Howe published ''talespinning'', a collection of short fiction, including several horror stories, ''Doctor Who'' fiction and [[drabble]]s.<ref name="geekdad">{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2011/09/talespinning-by-david-j-howe-who-horror-and-more/ |title=''Talespinning'' by David J Howe: Who, Horror and More |last1=Brown |first1=Sophie |date=30 September 2011 |website=[[GeekDad]] |publisher=[[Wired.com]] |accessdate=1 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onemetal.com/2011/10/06/talespinning-by-david-j-howe/ |title=Talespinning by David J.
