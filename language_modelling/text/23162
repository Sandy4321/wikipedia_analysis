"'''Eek, a Penis!'''" is episode 1205 (#172) of the animated series ''[[South Park]]''.<ref name="Comedy Central Press Release">{{cite web | title=Episode 1205 Press Release | publisher=Comedy Central | year=2008 | url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2008/040708_sp_eek_penis.jhtml | accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> It was first broadcast on [[April 9]], [[2008]]. The school subplot is based on many movies, most notably ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', with "Mr. Cartmenez" being based on [[Jaime Escalante]].

== Plot ==
The episode begins with [[Herbert Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] crying in front of her class as she recounts the story of [[Male pregnancy#Pregnancy among intersex and transgender people|Thomas Beatie]], the pregnant transsexual man who appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' a week before the episode's release. She explains that she is no longer happy as a "woman", but cannot return to being a man because her [[penis]] was destroyed after her [[sex reassignment surgery|sex-change operation]] in the episode "[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]". After launching into a rage, Garrison is removed from teaching by Principal Victoria until her personal life can be resolved, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is appointed as temporary teacher in Garrison's place. The kids in class then steal the answer sheet for the next day's quiz from Garrison's desk, and as a result pass with high scores. Impressed, the Denver County school board, based on the investigators from ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', asks Cartman to teach a struggling inner-city classroom at [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] High School (a spoof on [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]] where [[Jaime Escalante]] worked). Also, it should be noted that the basketball court scoreboard shows the school name [[East High School (Denver)|East High School]], an actual inner-city public high school located in Denver.

Mrs. Garrison sees on the news how scientists cause a [[Vacanti mouse|mouse to grow a human ear]], and decides to have the same experiment performed on him to get a new penis. Using some of his male DNA and all of his money, scientists are able to create a mouse with a penis on it, but it escapes from the lab and begins to race all over town causing stereotypical [[fear of mice|hysterical reactions in all women who see it]] (They do not acknowledge it as a mouse, only referring to it as a "penis"). Mrs. Garrison looks for it in vain, as it winds up in various houses, restaurants, etc, and even stopping to sing a parody of "''[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]''" from ''[[An American Tail]]''. Eventually, however, it vanishes into the sewers, and Mrs. Garrison goes back to moping that she will never be a man again.

Meanwhile, Cartman, taking Kyle's warning about the dangers of inner-city students, disguises himself as a Hispanic man, as a parody of the movie ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'' and teaches his students how white people are able to succeed when they can not: by [[cheating]]. He then teaches his class numerous cheating techniques, explaining that as long as they succeed, no one will judge them. Cartman cites [[Bill Belichick]]'s success after cheating in the [[Spygate]] football scandal.  He teaches them to memorize test answers, use cameras, and, in the case of a pregnant girl, getting an [[abortion]] (which he explains is "''cheating nature itself''", and that "''white girls do it all the time and get away with it''"). When the kids do amazingly well, they are then challenged to take the hardest, most secure standardized test in the state, and pass. The class honors "Mr. Cartmanez" for teaching them "The White People Method", and he is universally praised.
  
While Mrs. Garrison is moping in the park, the mouse with her penis shows up and allows itself to be caught, and Mrs. Garrison undergoes an operation to become Mr. Garrison again. He arrives back at school and explains that he now realizes that the true judge of gender is whether someone can get pregnant. The episode concludes when one teacher objects that his wife cannot have babies because of [[ovarian cancer]], and Mr. Garrison responds with, "''Well then get an [[AIDS]] test, Thomson, 'cause your wife's a dude, [[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]. Yeah! I'm back!''"
