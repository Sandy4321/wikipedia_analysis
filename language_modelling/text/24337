The '''Pharos of Alexandria''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <span style="font:bold 101% Palatino Linotype">o <U+03A6><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> <U+0391><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03BE><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03C2></span>) was a tall tower built in the [[3rd century BC]] (between 285 and 247 BC) on the [[island]] of [[Pharos]] in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] to serve as that port's landmark, and later, its [[lighthouse]].

With a height variously estimated at between 115 and 150 meters (383 - 450 ft) it was among the tallest man-made structures on Earth for many centuries, and was identified as one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]] by [[Antipater of Sidon]]. It was the third tallest building after the two Great Pyramids (of [[Khufu]] and [[Khafra]]) for its entire life. Some scholars estimate a much taller height exceeding 180 meters that would make the tower the tallest building up to the 14th century.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

=== History === 
Pharos was a small island just off the coast of Alexandria. It was linked to the mainland by a man-made connection named the [[Heptastadion]], which thus formed one side of the city's harbor. As the Egyptian coast is very flat and lacking in the kind of landmark used at the time for [[navigation]], a marker of some sort at the mouth of the harbour was deemed necessary - a function the Pharos was initially designed to serve. Use of the building as a lighthouse, with a fire and reflective mirrors at the top, is thought to date to around the 1st century AD, during the Roman period. Prior to that time the Pharos served solely as a navigational landmark.


The medieval Chinese were familiar with the story of the lighthouse in Alexandria by at least the [[Song Dynasty]] ([[960]] - [[1279]]) period. In his book ''Zhu Fan Zhi'', [[Zhao Ru-gua]] wrote in [[1225]] of a [[minaret]] lighthouse in Alexandria, Egypt, perhaps the ancient Lighthouse of Alexandria ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):

<blockquote>
The country of O-Ken-Tho (Alexandria) belongs to Egypt (Wu-Ssu-Li). According to tradition, in olden times a stranger (i jen), Chhu-Ko-Ni by name, built on the shore of the sea a great [[Chinese pagoda|pagoda]], underneath which the earth was excavated to make two rooms, well connected and thoroughly hidden. In one vault was stored grain, and in the other arms. The tower was 200 ft. high [Note: ''chang'' = 10 feet, ''chhih'' = 1 foot]. Four horses abreast could ascend (by a winding ramp) to two-thirds of its height. Below the tower, in the middle, there was a well of great size connected by a tunnel with the great river. To protect this pagoda from foreign soldiers, the whole country guarded it against all enemies. In the upper and lower parts of it twenty thousand men could readily be stationed as a guard or to make sorties. At the summit there was an immense mirror. There was an old story said that if warships of other countries tried to make an attack, the mirror detected them beforehand, and the troops were ready to repel it. But in recent years there came (to Alexandria) a foreigner, who asked to be given work in the guardhouse below the tower, and he was employed to sprinkle and to sweep. For years no one entertained any suspicion of him, but suddenly one day he found an opportunity to steal the mirror and throw it into the sea, after which he made off.<ref name="Needham 662">Needham, 662.</ref>
</blockquote>

=== Construction and destruction ===
In the 3rd century BC, after having been initiated by [[Satrap]] (governor) [[Ptolemy I of Egypt]], Egypt's first Hellenistic ruler and a general of [[Alexander the Great]]. After Alexander died unexpectedly at age 33, Ptolemy Soter (Saviour, named so by the inhabitants of Rhodes) made himself king in 305 BC and ordered the construction of the Pharos shortly thereafter. The building was finished during the reign of his son, [[Ptolemy Philadelphos]].

According to legend, [[Sostratus of Cnidus|Sostratus]] was forbidden by Ptolemy from putting his name on his work. But the architect left the following inscription on the base's walls nonetheless: 
Sostratus, the son of Dexiphanes, the Cnidian, dedicated (or erected) this to the Saviour Gods, on behalf of those who sail the seas (the original Greek inscription <small> <U+03A3><U+039F><U+03A3><U+03A4><U+03A1><U+0391><U+03A4><U+039F><U+03A3> <U+0394><U+0395><U+039E><U+0399><U+03A6><U+0391><U+039D><U+039F><U+03A5> <U+039A><U+039D><U+0399><U+0394><U+0399><U+039F><U+03A3> <U+0398><U+0395><U+039F><U+0399><U+03A3> <U+03A3><U+03A9><U+03A4><U+0395><U+03A1><U+03A3><U+0399><U+039D> <U+03A5><U+03A0><U+0395><U+03A1> <U+03A4><U+03A9><U+039D> <U+03A0><U+039B><U+03A9><U+0399><U+0396><U+039F><U+039C><U+0395><U+039D><U+03A9><U+039D></small> literally means: Sostratos of Dexiphanes [meaning: son of Dexiphanes] the Cnidian to Saviour Gods for the seafarers (or sea-faring [ones]). These words were hidden under a layer of plaster, on top of which was chiselled another inscription honouring Ptolemy the king as builder of the Pharos. After centuries the plaster wore away, revealing the name of Sostratus. 
[[Image:DSC00293.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Citadel of Qaitbay|Fort Qaitbey]] was built on the site of the Pharos in the 15th Century, using some of its fallen masonry.]]

Other legends tell of the light from the Pharos being used to burn enemy ships before they could reach shore; this is unlikely due to the relatively poor quality of optics and reflective technology in the period during which the building existed. Almost as impressive<U+2014>and probably more accurate<U+2014>is the claim that the light from the lighthouse could be seen up to 35 miles (56 km) from shore.

Constructed from large blocks of light-coloured stone, the tower was made up of three stages: a lower square section with a central core, a middle octagonal section, and, at the top, a circular section. At its apex was positioned a [[mirror]] which reflected [[sunlight]] during the day; a [[fire]] was lit at night. Extant Roman coins struck by the Alexandrian mint show that a statue of a [[triton (mythology)|triton]] was positioned on each of the building's four corners. A statue of [[Poseidon]] stood atop the tower during the Roman period.
[[Image:Pharos_of_Alexandria.jpg|thumb|left|A fanciful 16th century interpretation of the Pharos by [[Martin Heemskerck]].]]
The Pharos' walls were strengthened in order to withstand the pounding of the waves through the use of molten lead to hold its masonry together{{Fact|date=February 2007}}, and possibly as a result the building survived the longest of the Seven Wonders - with the sole exception of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. It was still standing when the Muslim traveller [[Ibn Jubayr]] visited the city in [[1183]]. He said of it that: "Description of it falls short, the eyes fail to comprehend it, and words are inadequate, so vast is the spectacle." It appears that in his time there was a [[church]] located on the top{{Fact|date=April 2007}}. 

The tower was severely damaged by two [[earthquake]]s in [[1303]] and [[1323]], to the extent that the Arab traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] reported not being able to enter the ruin. Even the stubby remnant disappeared in [[1480]], when the then-Sultan of Egypt, [[Qaitbay]], built a medieval fort on the former location of the building, using some of the fallen stone. The remnants of the Pharos that were incorporated into the walls of [[Citadel of Qaitbay|Fort Qaitbey]] are clearly visible due to their excessive size in comparison to surrounding masonry.

=== Recent archaeological research ===
Some remains of the lighthouse were found on the floor of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour by divers in 1994. More of the remains have subsequently been revealed by satellite imaging {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

A NOVA program chronicled the underwater discovery of the fabled Pharos lighthouse.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sunken/ NOVA online - Treasures of the Sunken City]</ref>

It is possible to go diving and see the ruins, if the diver is over the age of 18.

=== Significance ===
''Pharos'' became the etymological origin of the word 'lighthouse' in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''<U+03C6><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>''), [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] (''<U+0444><U+0430><U+0440>'') and many [[Romance languages]], such as [[French language|French]] (''phare''),
[[Italian language|Italian]] (''faro''), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''farol''), [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''faro''), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''far'').

The design of [[minaret]]s in many early Islamic mosques many centuries later followed a similar three-stage design to that of the Pharos, attesting to the building's broader architectural influence.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Pharos in culture ==
[[Image:Pharos at Abuqir.jpg|thumb|left|The Pharos of Abuqir, an ancient funerary monument thought to be modelled after the Pharos at Alexandria, with which it is approximately contemporaneous.]] 

[[Image:Lighthouse of Alexandria in Changsha China.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the Lighthouse of Alexandria in the "Window of the World" Cultural Park in [[Changsha]], [[China]]]]

=== In architecture ===
* A well-preserved ancient tomb in the town of [[Abu Qir]], 20 kilometres east of Alexandria, is thought to be a scaled-down model of the Alexandria Pharos. Known colloquially under various names - the ''Pharos of Abuqir'', the ''Abuqir funerary monument'' and ''Burg al-Arab'' (Arab's Tower) - it consists of a 3-storey tower, approximately 20 metres in height, with a square base, a hexagonal midsection and cylindrical upper section, like the building upon which it was apparently modelled. It dates to the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (285-246 BCE), and is therefore likely to have been built at about the same time as the Alexandria Pharos.
* A replica of the Lighthouse of Alexandria was constructed in the [[Window of the World]] Cultural Park in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]]. 
* The design of the [[George Washington Masonic National Memorial]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] was partially inspired by the Lighthouse of Alexandria.
* The fate of the Lighthouse of Alexandria from the Arab conquest till its collapse in the 14th century has been investigated by Doris Behrens-Abouseif in her article "The Islamic History of the Lighthouse of Alexandria" (in: Muqarnas XXIII [2006], pp. 1-14)

=== On screen ===
Pharos has appeared in a few movies and television shows, including [[Asterix and Cleopatra]] and the HBO series [[Rome (series)|''Rome'']].

=== In books ===
[[Matthew Reilly]] uses this ancient wonder as the location of a piece of the golden capstone in his latest novel [[Seven Ancient Wonders]].

=== In games ===
* The Lighthouse is among the World Wonders that can be built in the ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' computer game series; in the third and fourth installments of the series it is known as the Great Lighthouse.
* There is a large desert lighthouse in ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' called the Pharos.
* The Lighthouse is a late-Age structure buildable in ''[[Age of Mythology]]''.
* The Lighthouse is one of the World Wonders to be captured in the computer game, ''[[Rome:Total War]]'', which grants benefits to the owner.
* The Lighthouse is one of the monuments that can be built in the computer games [[Pharaoh and Cleopatra]].
* The Lighthouse is in the [[Mare Nostrum (board game)|Mare Nostrum]] [[board game]].
* The Lighthouse is one of the wonders of the world in the computer game ''[[Empire Earth]]''.
* The Pharos is the name of a tall lighthouse-like structure in the [[Playstation 2]] game ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]''.
* The navigation buoy in the PC [[space simulator]] game [[FreeSpace 2]] is called the "GTNB Pharos".
* There are four elemental lighthouses in the [[Game Boy Advance]] games [[Golden Sun]] and [[Golden Sun 2]].
* The Lighthouse of Alexandria can be explored in the Game [[Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation]]
