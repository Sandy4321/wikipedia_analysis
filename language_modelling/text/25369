"'''Forever and Always'''" is a song written by American singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]] for her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). It was a last-minute addition to the album<ref name="rolling stone">{{cite web|last=Scaggs|first=Austin|title=Taylor's Time: Catching Up With Taylor Swift|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylors-time-catching-up-with-taylor-swift-20100125|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine){{!}}Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> but went on to become a fan favorite, becoming certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]]<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web | url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Swift,+Taylor%22 | title=American certifications <U+2013> Swift, Taylor | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> and peaking within the Top 40 of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] despite not being individually released or promoted as a single. "Forever & Always" revolves lyrically around a breakup and the resultant heartache, and is musically one of the most decidedly [[pop music|pop]]-oriented songs on the album.

==Background and recording==
Inspired by her recent break-up with [[Joe Jonas]],<ref name="about joe">{{cite web|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Taylor Swift Talks About Joe Jonas Breakup Online, On The Radio, On TV And In Her New Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1598752/taylor-swift-opens-up-about-joe-jonas-breakup.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom Media Networks{{!}}Viacom]]|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> Swift quickly wrote and recorded the song at the last minute for inclusion on ''Fearless''. As Swift explained in a track-by-track insight into the album, the song was written about a man in her life who she could see "slowly [slipping] away" from her and the confusion she felt in dealing with a crumbling relationship.<ref name="cutbycut">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigmachinerecords.com/taylorswift/index.cfm?id=110|title=Cut By But|first=Taylor|last=Swift|authorlink=Taylor Swift|work=''Bigmachinerecords.com''|publisher=[[Big Machine Records]]|accessdate=October 28, 2013|archivedate=July 27, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5rXkDwe4d}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', Swift described the fallout of that relationship as a "really dramatic and crazy" experience that she "[needed] to address" through her music.<ref name="rolling stone"/>

Jonas addressed the song in the June 2009 issue of ''Seventeen'' Magazine. When talking about it, he said he wasn't bothered by Swift writing a song about their relationship. "It's flattering," said Jonas. "It's always nice to hear their side of the story."<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=13675|title=Forever & Always by Taylor Swift}}</ref>

In 2009, Swift re-recorded the song in an acoustic ballad style for the [[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)#Platinum Edition re-release|Platinum Edition]] [[re-issue]] of ''Fearless''. This remastered cut is officially titled "'''Forever & Always (Piano version)'''".

==Live performances==
Swift performed "Forever & Always" at the 2009 [[Country Music Association Awards|CMA Awards]] and nightly on her 2009<U+2013>2010 [[Fearless Tour]].
