'''Waterfall Gully''' is an outer [[List of Adelaide suburbs|suburb]] of the [[South Australia]]n capital city of [[Adelaide]]. It is located in the [[Adelaide Hills|foothills]] of the [[Mount Lofty Ranges]] around {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-south-east of Adelaide's [[central business district]] (CBD). For the most part, the suburb encompasses one long [[gully]] with First Creek at its centre and Waterfall Gully Road running adjacent to the creek. At the southern end of the gully is First Falls, the [[waterfall]] for which the suburb was named. Part of the [[City of Burnside]], Waterfall Gully is bounded to the north by the suburb of [[Burnside, South Australia|Burnside]], from the north-east to south-east by [[Cleland Conservation Park]] (part of the suburb of [[Greenhill, South Australia|Greenhill]]), to the south by [[Crafers West, South Australia|Crafers West]], and to the west by [[Leawood Gardens, South Australia|Leawood Gardens]] and [[Mount Osmond, South Australia|Mount Osmond]].

Historically, Waterfall Gully was first explored by European settlers in the early-to-mid 1800's, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land under the auspices of the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under [[Government of South Australia|State Government]] control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.

Over the years Waterfall Gully has been extensively logged, and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops, along with the development of local [[Market gardening|market garden]]s and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]]. Attempts to [[Mining|mine]] the area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one of the state's earliest [[Watermill|water-powered mill]]s, and a [[weir]] erected in the early 1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside's water supply. Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks.

== History ==

The [[Mount Lofty Ranges]], which encompass Waterfall Gully, was first sighted by [[Matthew Flinders|Captain Matthew Flinders]] in 1802.<ref name="Hardy1989p5">Hardy (1989), p. 5.</ref> The gully itself was discovered soon after the [[History of Adelaide#European settlement|establishment of Adelaide]], and [[William Light|Colonel William Light]], the first [[Surveyor-General]] of the new colony, was said to have "decided on the site for Adelaide when viewing the plains from the hills near Waterfall Gully".<ref name="Hardy1989p5" /> Nevertheless, the gully had seen human visitors long before the arrival of the Europeans, as the native population had lived in the area for up to 40,000 years prior to Flinders' appearance off the South Australian coast.<ref name="Hardy1989p4">Hardy (1989), p. 4.</ref>

=== Ethnohistory ===

In Australian [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Aboriginal mythology]], Waterfall Gully and the surrounding Mount Lofty Ranges are part of the story of the ancestor-creator ''Nganno''.<ref name="Nganno">While the Department of Environment and Heritage (2001) refers to ''Nganno'', Hardy (1989, p. 5) employs ''Yurebilla'', and Kleinig names the figure as ''Jureidla''.</ref> Travelling across the land of the native [[Kaurna]] people, Nganno was wounded in a battle and laid down to die, forming the Mount Lofty Ranges.<ref name="DEF2001">Department for Environment and Heritage (2001)</ref> The ears of Nganno formed the peaks of [[Mount Lofty]] and [[Mount Bonython]], and the region was referred to as ''Yur-e-billa'', or "the place of the ears".<ref name="Smith2005p3">Smith, Pate & Piddock (2005), p. 3.</ref> The name of the Greater Mount Lofty Parklands, Yurrebilla, was derived from this term,<ref name="DEF2001" /> while the nearby town of [[Uraidla, South Australia|Uraidla]] employs a more corrupted form.<ref name="Hardy1989p5" />

Although Hardy states that the Kaurna people did not live in the ranges themselves, they did live on the lower slopes.<ref name="Hardy1989p4-5">Hardy (1989), pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> An early settler of the neighbouring suburb of [[Beaumont, South Australia|Beaumont]], James Milne Young, described the local Kaurnas: "At every creek and gully you would see their [[Hump|wurlies]] [simple Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass] and their fires at night ... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river; some toward the Ranges; some on the Waterfall Gully."<ref>Stringer (1986)</ref> Their main presence, demarcated by the use of fire against purchasers of land,<ref name="Smith2005p3" /> was on the [[River Torrens]] and the creeks that flowed into it, including Waterfall Gully's First Creek.<ref name="Kleinig">Kleinig, "Mt Lofty: A View Down Through the Early Years"</ref>

The land around Waterfall Gully provided the original inhabitants with a number of resources. The bark from the local [[stringybark]] trees ([[Eucalyptus obliqua]])<ref name="Smith2005p3" /> was used in the construction of winter huts, and stones and native timbers were used to form tools.<ref name="Hardy1989p4" /> Food was also present, and [[Witchetty grub|cossid moth larvae]] along with other species of plants and animals were collected.<ref name="Smith2005p3" /> Nevertheless, there were only a few resources that could only be found on the slopes, and "both hunting and food gathering would in general have been easier on the rich plains".<ref name="Hardy1989p5" />

=== Early colonial exploration ===

[[Image:Waterfall Gully 1866.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Waterfall Gully in 1866]]
One of the earliest accounts of Waterfall Gully comes from a "Mr Kent" who, along with [[Collet Barker|Captain Collet Barker]] and Barker's servant, Miles, climbed Mount Lofty in 1831. In making their ascent the party skirted a ravine<U+2014>described by Mr Kent as possessing "smooth and grassy sides"<U+2014>which is believed by Anne Hardy to have been Waterfall Gully.<ref name="Hardy1989p5" /> Subsequent to Barker's ascent, the first settlers who were recorded as having climbed Mount Lofty were Bingham Hutchinson and his servant, William Burt. The pair made three attempts to scale the mount before succeeding, and for their first attempt they attempted to traverse Waterfall Gully.<ref name="Hardy1989p6">Hardy (1989), p. 6.</ref> The attempt was unsuccessful, but in July, 1837, Hutchinson wrote about the gully though which they had travelled. Waterfall Gully he wrote, had proven difficult, as the plants were so thickly grown as to provide a significant barrier to their progress. Near the point of surrender, Hutchinson described how they were "agreeably surprised by seeing a wall of rock about fifty or sixty feet [fifteen to eighteen meters] high, which stretched across the ravine, and from the top of it leapt the brook which had so long been [their] companion".<ref name="Hutchinson">Hutchinson, in Warburton (1981), pp. 187-188. Hutchinson reported that they continued the climb, but surrendered after being faced with another steep ravine separating them from their goal.</ref> The brook was First Creek, and the waterfall they sighted is today known as First Falls.<ref name="Warburton1977p28">Warburton (1977), p. 28.</ref>

Nevertheless, Hutchinson was not the first to see First Falls. The first known recorded sighting of the waterfall by a colonial was that of John William Adams, an emigrant of [[HMS Buffalo (1813)|H.M.S. ''Buffalo'']] in early January 1837, who named it "Adams' Waterfall". He was traveling with his wife, Susanna and a party consisting of Nicholson's and Breaker's who had the use of a [[dray]] to go into the hills. Adams states "we were opposite the spot where the Eagle on the Hill now is, and the question was put, who would volunteer to go down the hillside to try for water".<ref name="Stringer1980">Stringer (1980)</ref>

=== Development ===

The area soon became a tourist attraction for the early South Australian colonists, and was a popular destination for picnickers. In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that "Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque place for a picnic that I have ever visited",<ref name="Clark">Clark, Francis in Warburton (1981), p. 188.</ref> and by the 1860s the area had become known throughout Adelaide.<ref name="Warburton1977p28" /> The use of Waterfall Gully as picnic spot was facilitated by the decision of the government of the day not to subdivide the area containing the waterfalls. Section 920, as it was designated, did not enter into private hands, and thus members of the public were able to access the area from the nearby suburb of [[Eagle on the Hill, South Australia|Eagle on the Hill]] on Mount Barker road.<ref name="Warburton1981p188">Warburton (1981), p. 188.</ref> The position of the Eagle on the Hill hotel proved advantageous for this, as it permitted visitors to stop by for lunch before walking down the hill in the afternoon.<ref name="Warburton1981p102">Warburton (1981), p. 102.</ref>

[[Image:Waterfall Gully, 1910.jpg|thumb|left|View of Waterfall Gully in South Australia, as seen from Eagle on the Hill in 1910]]
Other parts of the Waterfall Gully area were subdivided, though, and much of the area was owned by [[Samuel Davenport]]. Davenport used the land for timber, grazing, and the cultivation of various crops, including olives and grapes for [[Winemaking|wine production]].<ref name="Warburton1977p28-31">Warburton (1977), pp. 28<U+2013>31.</ref> Other local residents ran market gardens and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]]. For example, local residents Wilhelm M<U+00FC>gge and his wife Auguste Schmidt operated "one of the best nurseries and market gardens near Adelaide", and gained a reputation for the cheeses produced from their local dairy farm.<ref name="Warburton1981p188-189">Warburton (1981), pp. 188<U+2013>189.</ref> Along with farming, the hills and creek were prized areas for the [[Lumberjack|sawyer]]s and splitters,<ref name="Kleinig" /> and a number of mines were established in the region from the mid-to-late 1800s. In 1844 the first [[Silver mining|silver-lead]], [[manganese]] and [[iron]] mines were established in the area, while the 1890s saw a minor gold rush&mdash;although "only small quantities were extracted".<ref name="Warburton1981p193">Warburton (1981), p. 193.</ref> Of greater success was stone quarrying in Chambers' Gully, which began in 1863 and increased in scale in 1912.<ref name="Warburton1981p193" /> 

Waterfall Gully was also the site of Burnside's "first secondary industry".<ref name="Ifould1956p43">Ifould (1956), p. 43.</ref> In the late 1830s, Thomas Cain built a [[watermill]] on First Creek for John Cannan, which was then employed to power a sawmill on Cannan's property. Cannan operated the mill as the "Traversbrook Mill" for approximately two years before selling the venture to a Mr. Finniss. Finniss opted to run the mill as a flour mill instead, and the mill was rebuilt and renamed "Finnissbrook Mill". The mill continued to operate under a variety of owners until the late 1850s, but it was dismantled during the 1880s, and today only traces of the earthworks remain.<ref name="Jones1981pp106-107">Jones (1981), pp. 106<U+2013>107.</ref>

[[Image:Waterfall Gully 1872.jpg|thumb|First Falls in the late 1800's, with the [[weir]] visible in the foreground]]
During this period the population of the nearby village of [[Burnside, South Australia|Burnside]] was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creek&mdash;which runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's [[Adelaide Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]]&mdash;was seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A [[weir]] was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000&nbsp;US&nbsp;gallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South,<ref name="Dridan1956p87">Dridan (1956), p. 87.</ref> and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area.<ref name="Warburton1981p190">Warburton (1981), p. 190.</ref> As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.<ref name="Warburton1981p192">Warburton (1981), p. 192.</ref>

While the route to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the alternative route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their properties&mdash;especially from the M<U+00FC>gge family&mdash;led to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall Gully road was built in the late 1880s.<ref name="Warburton1981p189-190">Warburton (1981), pp. 189<U+2013>190.</ref>

The completion of the road led to an increase in visitor numbers.<ref name="Warburton1981p192"/> Rather than a bumpy horse ride,<ref name="Warburton1981p189">Warburton (1981), p. 189.</ref> visitors could now catch the [[Horsecar|horse tram]] to the start of the gully, and walk, cycle or ride to the falls.<ref name="Warburton1981p191-192">Warburton (1981), pp. 191<U+2013>192.</ref> To provide for tourists, the area gained a number of road-side kiosks and produce stalls, and the M<U+00FC>gge family erected the two story Waterfall Hotel along the path. Furthermore, in 1912 the government opened a kiosk at the base of First Falls,<ref name="Warburton1981p192" /> designed in the "style of a Swiss chalet".<ref name="Hardy1989p11">Hardy (1989), p. 11.</ref> The hotel is a private residence today, but the kiosk continues to operate.<ref name="Warburton1981p192" />

=== Protection ===

Although some parts of Waterfall Gully were transferred from the District Council of East Torrens (now the [[Adelaide Hills Council]]) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established,<ref name="Melbourne1956p11">Melbourne (1956a), p. 11.</ref> the government of the day chose to retain control of a significant portion of Waterfall Gully.<ref name="Hardy1989p7">Hardy (1989), p. 7.</ref> Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F. Cleland.<ref name="Hardy1989p7" /> 

The land remained under the Burnside Council's control until 1912, when the Waterfall Gully Reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first National Pleasure Resort in the state. Initially the reserve was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Parks Advisory Board, but later it was moved to the Tourist Bureau, before finally becoming part of the National Park Commission's portfolio.<ref name="Hardy1989p8-11">Hardy (1989), pp. 8<U+2013>11.</ref>

In 1945, much of the area that is today's [[Cleland Conservation Park]] was purchased by the [[Government of South Australia|State Government]], largely thanks to the efforts of [[John Burton Cleland|Professor Sir John Cleland]]. Most of this land was combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of [[Mount Lofty]] and northwards to Greenhill Road. Waterfall Gully Reserve was added to the park in 1972.<ref name="Hardy1989p11">Hardy (1989), p. 11.</ref>

=== Natural disasters ===

[[Image:Waterfall Gully flood.jpg||thumb|right|Waterfall Gully Road after the November 2005 Floods]]

Over the years since European settlement Waterfall Gully has suffered from both bushfires and flooding. The gully was severely hit by a number of [[bushfire]]s in 1939 that threatened the area, and further bushfires in the early 1940s caused considerable damage because of the [[World War II|war effort]] diverting supplies and personnel from the [[Country Fire Service]] (CFS).<ref name="Lovett2005">Lovett (2005)</ref> Significant floods occurred in 1889 and 1931,<ref name="Warburton1981p329">Warburton (1981), p. 329.</ref> and, on the night of 7 November 2005, Waterfall Gully was one of several areas in Adelaide to experience severe flooding. Waterfall Gully was one of the hardest hit suburbs: Bob Stevenson, Duty Officer of the [[State Emergency Service]] (SES), commented that "There's an area called Waterfall Gully Road, in the foothills, where one of the creeks comes down, and there's quite a few houses affected there ... there was 40 or so houses affected on that one road alone."<ref name="FlashFlooding">"Flash flooding hits Adelaide" (8 November 2005)</ref> Properties were flooded, two bridges nearly collapsed, and {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of road was washed away. Burnside council workers, the CFS and the SES repaired the initial damage on the night while reconstruction of infrastructure commenced in late November. Much of the road had been inaccessible, and the suburb was closed except to residents and emergency workers for the remainder of the month.<ref name="HomesFlooded">"Media Release: Hundreds of Homes Affected by Floods"(8 November 2005)</ref>

== Geography ==

[[Image:Location of Waterfall Gully Road.svg|thumb|Location of Waterfall Gully Road in the Adelaide Metropolitan Area]]
Waterfall Gully is situated at an average elevation of {{convert|234|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, in an area of {{convert|6.08|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. Its most notable geographical features are its gully and waterfall. [[Langman Reserve]], a large local park, is {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the start of Waterfall Gully Road while much of the north-eastern side of the gully is part of Cleland Conservation Park. Adjoining Waterfall Gully, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away, is [[Chambers Gully]], which used to function as a [[landfill|land-fill]], but has in the past decade been reclaimed as a park through volunteer work.<ref name="weeds">"Winning the war on weeds" (10 May 1999), p. 66.</ref> It contains a number of old ruins, walking trails, and springs and is home to a significant number of native species.

Since European Settlement the native plant life has been considerably affected, with the native [[Manna Gum]] and [[Eucalyptus leucoxylon|Blue Gum]] woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses.<ref name="NativeVegetation">"Native Vegetation" (11 November 2007)</ref> The large amount of non-native vegetation in the gully is predominantly the result of the early agriculture, although some species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, [[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]], [[fennel]] and blackberry.<ref name="Hardy1989p17-18">Hardy (1989), pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref> With the reduction of native flora, exotic fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, [[blackbird]]s and [[starling]]s. However, not all of the native wildlife has been lost<U+2014>bats (in particular, [[Gould's Wattled Bat]]), can be found in the area, as can [[Superb Fairy-wren]]s and [[Adelaide Rosella]]s, and a large number of unique [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as kangaroos, koalas and [[possum]]s can be spotted on some of the walking trails.<ref name="WalkingTrails">Walking Trails (11 November 2007)</ref>

== Transport ==

[[Image:Waterfall Gully Road.jpg|left|thumb|Waterfall Gully Road]]
Waterfall Gully is connected to the major Adelaide thoroughfare [[Greenhill Road]] by Waterfall Terrace and Glynburn Road, and cars are the preferred mode of transport in the suburb. According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] 71.9% of residents in the census area employed private vehicles for their commute to work. Only a small proportion (1.3%) walked to work and but 1.2% cycled, while only 3.6% of Waterfall Gully residents travel to work by bus.<ref name="PopStats" /> The closest bus route for Waterfall Gully is the 142 bus, provided by the multi-service [[Adelaide Metro]].

Waterfall Gully Road is meandering and in some parts quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists.<ref name="Garvis2007">Garvis (3 October 2007), p. 3.</ref> After the death of a cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of the entire length of the road.<ref name="Williams2008">Williams (1 April 2008), p. 16.</ref> As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of the road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.<ref name="Charrison2008">Charrison (11 June 2008), p. 5.</ref>

== Residents ==

[[Image:Waterfall Gully residents.png|right|thumb|Chart showing the breakdown of residents based on their place of birth, using data from the 2001 census<ref name="PopStats" />]]
In the 2001 Census, the population of the Waterfall Gully census area (which includes the suburbs of [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]], [[Leawood Gardens, South Australia|Leawood Gardens]] and [[Mount Osmond, South Australia|Mount Osmond]]) was 2,497 people, in an area of 6.08 square kilometers. Females outnumbered males 54.2% to 45.8%, and some 21.4% of the population was born overseas (see chart for a breakdown). There was only a slight change in the 2006 census, with the population increasing by 25 to 2,522.<ref name="PopStats">"Glen Osmond <U+2014> Mount Osmond <U+2014> Waterfall Gully <U+2014> Leawood Gardens"</ref>

The eight strongest religious affiliations in the area (based on the 2006 census figures) were (in descending order): [[Anglican]], [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]], [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Church of Christ]] and [[Baptist]] (a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and the Church of Christ, with 31 adherents). Also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation (67.3%) in the region in comparison to the Adelaide (and national) average. Christian belief (64.4%) is most prominent, with little growth in other religions.<ref name="PopStats" /> 

Residents in these four suburbs are more affluent than the Adelaide average, with a high occurrence of incomes over [[Australian dollar|AU$]]1000 per week, which is also above the average for the City of Burnside. A majority of workers are employed in professional or white collar fields.<ref name="PopStats" />

The census area that incorporates Waterfall Gully has a larger proportion of those in both the younger (0&ndash;17) and older (60+) age ranges than in the City of Burnside as a whole, and there have been no "numerically significant" changes in the age distribution between the 2001 and 2006 censuses. Similarly, family numbers are also stable, with almost no change between 2001 and 2006.<ref name="PopStats" />

== Attractions ==

[[Image:Waterfall Gully Restaurant.jpg|thumb|Waterfall Gully Restaurant]]
The main attraction of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It is at the south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park. The weir at the bottom of the Waterfall was constructed in the late 1800s and was part of Adelaide's early water supply.<ref name="Warburton1981p190" /> Development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912.<ref name="Melbourne1956p156">Melbourne (1956b), p. 156.</ref> Developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site, upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.<ref name="facelift1998">"Waterfall Gully facelift" (4 June 1998), p. 14.</ref>

The Waterfall Gully Restaurant was constructed between 1911 and 1912 by South Australian architects Albert Selmar Conrad and his brother Frank,<ref name="MayosHouse">"Place Details: Dr Helen Mayos House, 176&ndash;180 Mackinnon Pde, North Adelaide, SA, Australia"</ref> and was formally opened by [[Day Bosanquet|Sir Day Bosanquet]] on 9 November 1912.<ref name="Melbourne1956p156" /> Built in the style of a Swiss chalet, the building has been heritage listed since 1987,<ref name="MayosHouse">"Heritage Places Database Details: Waterfall Gully Kiosk/Restaurant, Cleland Conservation Park"</ref> and is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a firefighter who died from burns suffered in 1926.<ref name="Hardy1989p12">Hardy (1989), p. 12.</ref>

Other fire tracks and walking trails wind around the hills that surround Waterfall Gully, branching off from Chambers Gully, Woolshed Gully or the area around First Creek. Destinations include [[Crafers, South Australia|Crafers]], [[Eagle on the Hill, South Australia|Eagle on the Hill]], Mount Lofty, Mount Osmond and the Cleland Wildlife Park, located in the Cleland Conservation Park. The tracks have been completely rebuilt and resurfaced in the past ten years, and a number of older and more perilous routes have been sealed because of the difficult terrain. Many offer views of the city of Adelaide as well as the Gully itself. One of these is notable for connecting to the {{convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Heysen Trail]], and the trails are highly frequented.

Waterfall Gully is part of the state [[Electoral district of Bragg (South Australia)|electoral district of Bragg]], which has been held since 2002 by Liberal MP [[Vickie Chapman]].<ref name="Green2006">Green, Antony (20 April 2006)</ref> In federal politics, the suburb is part of the [[division of Sturt]], and has been represented by [[Christopher Pyne]] since 1993.<ref name="Green2007">Green, Antony (29 December 2007)</ref> The results shown are from the closest polling station to Waterfall Gully&mdash;which is located outside of the suburb&mdash;at St David's Church Hall on nearby Glynburn Road ([[Burnside, South Australia|Burnside]]). Both electorates have traditionally gone to the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]],<ref name="Green2006" /><ref name="Green2007" /> and Bragg in particular is regarded as a very safe Liberal seat.<ref name="Green2006" /> However, in the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], a strong swing towards the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] and their candidate, [[Mia Handshin]], resulted in the electorate transforming from a "safe [federal] Liberal seat into a marginal one".<ref name="Vaughan2007">Vaughan, Joanna (28 December 2007)</ref>

In [[local government]], Waterfall Gully is part of the [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] of Beaumont within the City of Burnside, and the current Mayor for the district is Wendy Greiner. Beaumont is currently represented by councilors Andrew Hillier and Davina Quirke.<ref name="BurnsideCouncl">"The Burnside Council" (26 November 2007)</ref>
