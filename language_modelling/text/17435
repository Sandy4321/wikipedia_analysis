'''Caldey''' is a small island off the SW coast of mainland [[Wales]], near [[Tenby]] in [[Pembrokeshire]].{{sfn|Hastings|2000|p=64}} With a [[recorded history]] going back over 1500 years, it is known as one of Holy Islands of Britain, and a number of traditions inherited from [[Celts|Celtic]] times are observed by the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] who are the chief inhabitants of the island today.<ref name=Celtic>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caldey-island.co.uk/ | title= Caldey Island|accessdate=5 May 2013|publisher=Caldey Island.co.uk}}</ref>

At its closest point, Caldey lies {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} south of the mainland, though the usual access to the island is by small boat from the town of Tenby which is some {{convert|4|km|mi|1}} to the north.

The island's population consists of 40 permanent residents and a varying number of Cistercian monks,<ref name=Fire>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-22572522|title= Caldey Island monks and residents get new 999 vehicle|accessdate=5 June 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> known as [[Trappists]], whose predecessors migrated there from Belgium in the early 20th century, taking over from [[Order of St Benedict (Anglican)|Anglican Benedictines]] who had bought the island in 1906 and built the extant monastery and abbey but later got into financial difficulties.<ref name=Brit>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89299/Caldey-Island|title=Caldey Island|accessdate=6 June 2013|publisher=Encyclopaedia Brittanica}}</ref> Today the monks farm the island, chiefly raising [[dairy cattle]], and make a range of items including cheese, shortbread, perfumes and toiletries.

In the spring and summer, visitors are ferried to Caldey, not only to visit the sacred sanctuary but also to view the island's rich wildlife.<ref name="Howells2011">{{cite book|author=Christopher Howells|title=Caldey Island: The Story of a Holy Island|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QRN7AQAACAAJ|accessdate=5 June 2013|date=March 2011|publisher=Graffeg|isbn=978-1-905582-14-3}}</ref>

== Name origins ==
The name Caldey (sometimes also spelled "Caldy") is derived from that given to it by the [[Vikings]], that is to say: ''kald ey'', the "cold island".<ref name=Brit/>{{sfn|Manwaring|2008|p=71}} In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the island is known as  ''Ynys B<U+0177>r'', after [[Saint Pyr]], an early abbot of the sixth century.{{sfn|Royal|1977|p=37}}

== History ==
A [[Celts|Celtic]] monastery was first established on the island in the sixth century, and the island thrived during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=294}}<ref name=Island>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caldey-island.co.uk/|title=Caldey Island Pembrokeshire Wales|accessdate=5 May 2013|publisher= Caldey-island.co.uk}}</ref> Following the Norman Conquest, [[Robert fitz Martin]], Lord of [[Cemais (Dyfed)|Cemais]], gave the island to his mother Geva.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cistercian Way - Caldey Island|url=http://cistercian-way.newport.ac.uk/place.asp?PlaceID=101|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> In the 12th century, a priory was established there by Benedictine monks, lasting until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536. The current abbey was built in 1910 by Anglican Benedictine monks but financial problems beginning in 1925 led to the 1929 purchase of the property by Belgian [[Cistercians]].{{Sfn|HeathMichell|2006|p=53}} It is considered to be the most complete example of the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style in the country, and was the largest project of [[John Coates Carter]]. At the time of building, the abbey was called "the greatest phenomenon in the Anglican community at the present time". The roofs are of white [[roughcast]] with red tiling, and the abbey church has five side-windows and on the south a "tapering" tower with primitive [[crenellation]]s. Caldey Island and Little Caldey Island has been an ecclesiastical district for as long as the locals can remember, with 20 Cistercian monks living at the monastery {{As of|2007|lc=on}}.{{sfn|Atkinson|Wilson|2007|p=167}} The Census Reports of the County of Pembroke record it as an ecclesiastical district for administrative purposes.{{sfn|Royal|1977|p=35}}

==Geography ==
Caldey Island is about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} long and {{convert|1|mi|km}} in width at its widest. It has an area of {{convert|538|acre|sqkm}} and its highest elevation is {{convert|197|ft|m}}. The island lies in [[Carmarthen Bay]] on the northern side of the [[Bristol Channel]] in the county of [[Pembrokeshire]], a little over {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} south of [[Tenby]] on the mainland of SW Wales.<ref name=Brit/>{{Sfn|HeathMichell|2006|p=53}} It is separated from the mainland by Caldey Sound. A ferry service from Tenby goes to Caldey Island in the spring and summer months when the weather allows.<ref name=Island>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caldey-island.co.uk/|title=Caldey Island Pembrokeshire Wales|accessdate=3 June 2013|publisher= Caldey-island.co.uk}}</ref> Boats depart every half hour from the harbour at high tide, while at low tide they depart from Castle Beach.{{sfn|Atkinson|Wilson|2007|p=167}}

Caldey Island consists of two islands which are separated at high tide: Caldey Island and Little Caldey Island. Little Caldey Island is also known as [[St. Margaret Island]] or "St. Margaret's Isle", and lies off the north-western point of Caldey Island. It acquired its name in the 17th century,{{sfn|Royal|1977|pp=36 & 37}} and is known for its [[Pinniped|seals]] and bird sanctuary.<ref name=Brit/>

Caldey Island contains about 500 acres (200 hectares) most of which is tillable land. Greenhouses on Caldey Island produce vegetables for the city of [[Cardiff]] in the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Glamorgan]]. There are also some hatcheries for raising chickens and other poultry on the island.{{sfn|Huntington|1908|p=323}} 
Caldey Island has a single village, but is best known for [[Caldey Abbey|its monastery]].

==Archaeological excavations==
[[File:Caldey Island Monastery Reflected in the Pond. - geograph.org.uk - 113053.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Caldey Island monastery, reflected in the pond]]
Three caves have been discovered on the island and excavated to unearth archaeological finds: Nanna's Cave,{{Sfn|Burrow|2003|p=237}} Potter's Cave (1950) and Ogof<U+2013>yr-Ychen ("Ox cave", 1970), were discovered.{{Sfn|Burrow|2003|p=56}} In Nanna's Cave human bones and shells were first found in 1911 and excavations continued in three more stages until the 1970s.{{Sfn|Burrow|2003|p=237}} Potter's Cave was found in 1950 by a monk named James Van Nedervelde, and excavations which continued until 1970 initially revealed [[stalagmite]]s in which tools and animals were embedded. After removal of these finds, three human skeletons were found and carbon-dated: two were dated to the [[Mesolithic|Middle Stone Age]] and one to the Romano-British period. Also found were a few artifacts from the late [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. In Ogof<U+2013>yr-Ychen, the remains of five people were found whose burials date to between 7590 BC and 571 Cal{{clarify|date=December 2013}} BC. [[Stable Isotope]] tests also revealed that they lived on marine food.{{Sfn|Burrow|2003|p=56}} A very few earlier Neolithic bowls and shells have also been found in the caves. All the finds were carbon dated and have been preserved in the Abbey of Caldey Island, or in [[Tenby Museum and Art Gallery]].{{Sfn|Burrow|2003|p=237}}

Tourist attractions on Caldey Island include the recently restored 13th century church of [[Illtud|St Illtyd]],<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Western Telegraph|title=Major restoration project for 13th century Caldey Island church|url=http://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/county/11324338.Major_restoration_project_for_13th_century_Caldey_Island_church/?ref=var_0|date=7 July 2014|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> an [[Ogham]] cross from the 6th century, a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] chapel, and [[Caldey Abbey]], completed in 1910. [[Caldey Lighthouse]] was built in 1828.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.wales.me/tourism/10-place-to-go-with-me/caldey-island |title=Caldey Island - Visit Me in Wales  |publisher=Wales.me |accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref> The light was intended to help coastal traffic trading limestone and coal to mid and north [[Wales]] but the light also helped long-distance and North American traffic identify the [[Bristol Channel]] and avoid confusion with the [[English Channel]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}. The lighthouse is a squat, round, brick-lined limestone [[tower]] of 17&nbsp;m (56&nbsp;ft), with walls 0.9&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) thick at the base and {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} thick at the top. The light stands 64&nbsp;m (210&nbsp;ft) above high-water mark. The lighthouse was automated in 1929. The [[lighthouse keeper]]'s  cottages that flank the lighthouse are two-storey, with hipped roofs, octagonal chimneys, and a one-storey linking corridor. The cottages were built around 1868-70 by T. C. Harvey.

The north side of Caldey Island is made up of grey [[limestone]], a desirable building material.{{sfn|Huntington|1908|p=323}} The 19th century seems to have been the height of limestone quarrying on the island; some of the limestone was taken to the [[Annery kiln]] in the district of [[Torridge]] for processing.<ref name=Island>{{Cite web|url=http://www.m0oxo.com/my-dxpeditions/caldey-island.html|title=Caldey Island |accessdate=3 June 2013|publisher= Charles Wilmott - M0OXO}}</ref>

==Other facilities==
The island issues its own postage stamps and has its own currency called the [[common dab|Dab]], referring to a small fish species which could be caught in the beaches. There is a colonial{{clarify|date=December 2013}} tea shop on the green fields.{{Sfn|HeathMichell|2006|pp=53&ndash;56}} There is an underground reservoir beneath the monastery which in the past supplied water to the garden and the people.{{Sfn|HeathMichell|2006|pp=53&ndash;56}}

The island's resources for handling emergencies have recently been supplemented with a multi-purpose emergency vehicle which can be used as a police car, an ambulance and also a water trailer for a fire engine. The island has a regular firefighting unit, a duty which used to be performed by the monks. The last reported major fire in the island was in 1940 when the monastery was damaged. In December 2012, six firefighters had to be brought by boat from Tenby to douse a small fire.<ref name=Fire/>
