==Professional wrestling career==
===Training===
While growing up in [[Calgary]], Singh attended numerous [[Stampede Wrestling]] events with her mother.<ref name=taint>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosS/sing_01aug4-sun.html|title=Mourners salute Sing|author=Wood, Michael|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-11-05|date=August 9, 2001}}</ref> She knew she wanted to be a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children.<ref name=fame>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosS/sing_rhonda_01jan-can.html|title=SLAM! Wrestling Canadian Hall of Fame: Rhonda Sing / Monster Ripper|author=Laroche, Stephen|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-08-23|date=January 9, 2001}}</ref> As a teenager, Sing approached members of the [[Hart wrestling family]] and asked to be trained, but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time.<ref name=taint/> [[Bret Hart]], however, claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts.<ref name=bret/> During a trip to [[Hawaii]] in 1978, she saw Japanese women's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport.<ref name=bret/> She later wrote [[Mildred Burke]], after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke's contact information,<ref name=fame/> and sent her a biography and photo.<ref name=bret/> Shortly thereafter, she joined Burke's training facility in [[Encino, Los Angeles, California|Encino, California]].<ref name=taint/>

===Japan, Canada, and Puerto Rico (1979<U+2013>1995)===
After a few weeks of training with Burke, Sing was scouted by [[All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling|All Japan Women]] (AJW), despite her inexperience.<ref name=taint/><ref name=bret/> Sing's debut match in Japan was a [[tag team]] match with partner Mami Kumano, defeating the Beauty Pair ([[Jackie Sato]] and Maki Ueda) in January 1979.<ref name=taint/><ref name=fame/> In Japan, she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper.<ref name=taint/> Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult, Sing held AJW's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan.<ref name=taint/><ref name=bret/> During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners.<ref name=fame/><ref name=bret/> Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring.<ref name=taint/> Sing, however, was comforted by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s [[Dynamite Kid]], who had also trained in Calgary.<ref name=fame/><ref name=bret/> Sing won the [[WWWA World Heavyweight Championship]] from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979.<ref name=fame/> Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980.<ref name=fame/> The title was vacated in August 1980.<ref name=fame/>

After another stint in Japan, Sing returned to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by [[Stu Hart]], the owner of the company.<ref name=taint/> There were plans to pair her with [[Gadowar Singh Sahota|Gama Singh]], but they never came to fruition.<ref name=taint/> During 1987, she was named their first [[IWA World Women's Championship|Women's Champion]] because she had defeated [[Wendi Richter]] prior to returning to Stampede.<ref name=fame/><ref name=bret>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/010804-sun.html|title=Singh earned much respect within wrestling circles|author=Hart, Bret|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=August 4, 2001|authorlink=Bret Hart}}</ref> She held the title until September 22, 1988, when she lost to [[Chigusa Nagayo]].<ref name=fame/>

Over the next few years, Sing once again traveled throughout the world and wrestled for a number of companies, holding several titles. Between 1987 and 1990, Sing worked in [[Puerto Rico]] for the [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC), where she held the [[WWC Women's Championship]] on five separate occasions by defeating Wendi Richter, [[Candi Devine]], and Sasha in matches for the title.<ref name=oww/>
. As Monster Ripper on the WWC 18th Anniversary Show (July 6, '91), she faced and beat El Profe on a woman vs man match.<ref name=profe>{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/faye.html|title=Bertha Faye}}</ref>

===United States (1995<U+2013>2000)===
====World Wrestling Federation (1995<U+2013>1996)====
[[File:Bertha Faye in the ring.jpg|thumb|Sing during her time in the [[WWE|WWF]] as Bertha Faye.]]
In 1995, Sing was contacted by the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] to help their fledgling women's division.<ref name=fame/> She, however, was repackaged as Bertha Faye, a comedic character who lived in a trailer park and dated [[David Lauer|Harvey Wippleman]].<ref name=taint/><ref name=fame/> (in a OWW radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two never got along well) WWF management originally wanted her to have a on-screen [[feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Bull Nakano]], but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with [[cocaine]] possession.<ref name=fame/>

Sing made her WWF debut on the April 3, 1995 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' participating in a sneak attack on [[Debra Miceli|Alundra Blayze]], making it appear as if Blayze's nose had been broken.<ref name=fame/> At [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]], Faye defeated Blayze for the [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]] and held the title until the October 23, 1995 airing of ''Monday Night Raw'', where Blayze regained the title.<ref name=wwe>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/women/304454132121112115|title=Bertha Faye's reign|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref><ref name=list/>

Fan interest in women's wrestling sunk once again as the year closed, and Sing tired of working there.<ref name=taint/> Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick.<ref name=bret/> WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief.<ref name=fame/><ref name=bret/> After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract.<ref name=fame/> She briefly returned to Japan, but did not like the new system, which did not guarantee payouts.<ref name=fame/>

====World Championship Wrestling (1999<U+2013>2000)====
In late 1999, she worked with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) briefly, appearing on several telecasts to help generate interest in a women's division.<ref name=fame/> She was also a contender for both the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] and [[WCW Hardcore Championship]]. In addition to competing in matches using her Singh and Monster Ripper gimmicks, she also made a couple of appearances with the [[Nitro Girls]] dance troupe under the name "Beef", for comic relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/1999122m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro - December 13, 1999|author=Wade|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=December 13, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ddtdigest.com/updates/2000072m.htm|title=WCW Monday Nitro - 07/10/2000|author=Big Mike|publisher=DDT Digest|accessdate=2008-08-18|date=July 10, 2000}}</ref>

After leaving WCW, Sing took a break from wrestling.<ref name=fame/> In 2001, Sing worked as a caregiver to the handicapped.<ref name=taint/> On July 27, 2001, Sing died of a heart attack.<ref name=ecwpress>{{cite book|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal|author=Muchnick, Irvin|publisher=ECW Press|year=2007|isbn=1-55022-761-0|page=148}}</ref><ref name=pwtorch>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Annual_Obituaries_39/article_24601.shtml|title=List of Deceased Wrestlers for 2001: Johnny Valentine, Terry Gordy, Chris Adams, Bertha Faye, Helen Hart|author=Gallipoli, Thomas M.|publisher=PWTorch|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Sing was never married nor had any children.
