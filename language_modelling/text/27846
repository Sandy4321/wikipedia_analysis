'''Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst''' (or '''Chalkhurst'''), commonly known as the '''Biddenden Maids''', were a pair of [[conjoined twins]] supposedly born in [[Biddenden]], [[Kent]], in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the '''Bread and Cheese Lands'''. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual [[:wikt:dole#Noun|dole]] of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775 the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard biscuits imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.

Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters was not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names "Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst" were first used.

Historian [[Edward Hasted]] dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was "a vulgar tradition" invented to account for it, while influential historian [[Robert Chambers]] accepted that the legend could potentially be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that they had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.

In 1907 the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.

The churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605 the custom that "on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and [[:wikt:diverse|divers]] barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn" was suspended on account of a visit from [[Charles Fotherby]], the [[Archdeacon of Canterbury]], owing to previous ceremonies having caused "much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} In 1645 [[rector]] William Horner<!-- Don't link this unless you write an article on the man; the 'other' William Horner, inventor of the Horner scheme, is unrelated to this one --> claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were [[glebe]] (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the [[Committee for Plundered Ministers]], who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}} Horner brought the case before the [[Court of the Exchequer]] in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=238}}<ref name="Hasted">{{citation|last=Hasted|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Hasted|year=1798|title=Parishes: Biddenden|journal=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent|publisher=British History Online|pages=130<U+2013>141|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63400}}</ref> Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women "who grew together in their bodies", but do not give any name for the women.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=258}}

In 1681 the "disorder and indecency" of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}} The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church, and from then on took place on the church porch.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=238<U+2013>239}}{{#tag:ref|The [[Pitt Rivers Museum]] claims that Biddenden church at one time featured a [[stained glass]] window depicting the Biddenham Maids, citing a purported poem found in "old charity documents" as evidence, which supposedly read ''The moon on the east side oriel shone&nbsp;/ Through slender shafts of shapely stone&nbsp;/ The silver light, so pale and faint&nbsp;/ Shewed the twin sisters and many a saint&nbsp;/ Whose images on the glass were dyed&nbsp;/ Mysterious maidens side by side&nbsp;/ The moon beam kissed the holy pane&nbsp;/ And threw on the pavement a mystic stain''.<ref name="Imaging of the Biddenden Maids">{{citation|url=http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-imaging-biddenden-maids.html|title=Imaging of the Biddenden Maids|publisher=Pitt Rivers Museum|accessdate=13 October 2010|location=Oxford}}</ref> This is in fact an extract from [[Walter Scott]]'s 1805 ''[[The Lay of the Last Minstrel]]'', describing [[Melrose Abbey]]; the line given as "Shewed the twin sisters and many a saint" reads ''Show'd many a prophet and many a saint'' in the original.{{sfn|Scott|1855|p=24}}|group=note}}

By 1770 it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20&nbsp;guineas (about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|21|1770|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=239}}<ref group="note" name="CPI note">[[Consumer Price Index (United Kingdom)|UK CPI]] inflation numbers based on data available from [http://www.measuringworth.com/ukearncpi/ Measuring Worth: UK CPI].

===Origins of the Biddenden Maids legend===
Although it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656,<ref name=PC>{{cite web|url=http://www.biddenden.gov.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Biddenden Parish Council |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> an anonymous article in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}}{{#tag:ref|It has been claimed that an account of the Maids was published in 1660, but this is believed to be a later addition which was pasted into the 1660 book.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}}|group=note}} This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the waist and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=241<U+2013>242}} The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the "Maids of Biddenden".{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}} The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity.{{sfn|Urban|1770|p=372}} As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a [[Street literature|broadside]] published in 1790.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=242}} ''[[The Antiquarian Repertory]]'' of 1775 says that the sisters had lived "as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago".{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=245}} Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.

Historian [[Edward Hasted]], in a volume of ''The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'' published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been "given by persons unknown").<ref name="Hasted" />{{#tag:ref|No family named Preston is recorded as having lived in or near Biddenden during the period in question. Records exist of a family named Chulkhurst living in Biddenden in the 17th and 18th centuries.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=241}}|group=note}} Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent "two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction".<ref name="Hasted" /> While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s<!-- Hasted says 20s, not 30s; don't "correct" this even though other sources give an age of 34 --> and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as "a vulgar tradition".<ref name="Hasted" />{{#tag:ref|Hasted was an expert on genealogy and topography but knew little about folklore and local tradition, and later critics have often been sceptical regarding his accuracy, especially regarding social and biographical history.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=242}}{{sfn|Jerrold|1914|p=219}} His contemporary (and [[Member of Parliament]] for nearby [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]]) [[Samuel Egerton Brydges]] described him as "a little, mean-looking man, with a long face and a high nose; quick in his movements, and sharp in his manner: he had no imagination or sentiment; nor any extraordinary quality of the mind, except memory."{{sfn|Timbs|1834|p=96}}|group=note}}

Hasted's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian [[Robert Chambers]],{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}} and the story was generally treated as a folk myth.{{#tag:ref|Although later writers have stated that Chambers accepted Hasted's arguments and dismissed the legend of the conjoined twins out of hand,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=257}} unlike Hasted, Chambers accepted that the legend was potentially true.{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}} He concluded that in the absence of any evidence for the sisters having existed, on the balance of probabilities the figures on the Biddenden cake were more likely to represent "the general objects of a charitable benefaction" and that the story of the twins was likely to be a folk myth created to explain the unusual design of the cakes.{{sfn|Chambers|1863|p=427}}|group=note}} A letter to the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500.<ref>{{citation|last=Heaton|first=J. D.|date=1869-04-17|title=United Twins|journal=British Medical Journal|publisher=British Medical Association|location=London|volume=1869 (1)|page=363}}</ref> The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins, particularly after [[Chang and Eng Bunker]] proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=243}} ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents, the editors describing Hasted's conclusions as "very obscure and unsatisfactory" and questioning why the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston,<ref>{{citation|last=Lloyd|first=George|date=1866-02-10|title=Chulkhurst: The Biddenden Maids|journal=Notes and Queries|publisher=Chappell & Co|location=London|page=122}}</ref> but no significant research into the tradition was carried out.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=243}}

===Growth of the charity===
As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter,<ref name="N&Q Folk Lore" /> the first recorded mention of the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst",{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}}

In the 1820s a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector's pew in Biddenden church was the sisters' burial place.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=217}}{{#tag:ref|One source claims that the sisters were taken to the monks at [[Battle Abbey]] and that they were buried in Hastings, but there is no evidence for this (No grave is visible near the rector's pew, but the church organ is situated in the site described and it may cover the grave.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=239}}).{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}}|group=note}} In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, "attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity".{{sfn|Hone|1830|p=445}} The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=218}} As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the [[workhouse]], but the crowds continued to cause problems.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=240}} In 1882 Biddenden's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=240}}

The left figure has "In 1100" written on her dress, and the right figure has "A 34" written on her dress.]]
In 1900 [[antiquarian]] [[George Clinch]] investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=219}} Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] (1553<U+2013>1558), a date roughly consistent with the "two hundred and fifty years ago" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=244}}{{#tag:ref|The point about the style of dress depicted on the cakes being that of the 16th, not the 12th, century had previously been made by an anonymous contributor to ''Notes and Queries'' in 1856.<ref name="N&Q Folk Lore" />|group=note}} He suggested that the "1100" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read "1500",{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=245}} and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=244}} It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=219}} Writing in the early 1930s, William Coles Finch explains the confusion over the dates, saying "the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be [[unleavened bread]].{{sfn|Coles Finch|1933|p=92}}

==Belief and scepticism==
In almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a [[Viability (fetal)|viable]] double fusion has ever been documented.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=246}}

Although Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=250}} This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of [[Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo]] (1617&nbsp;<U+2013> after&nbsp;1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}}

In 1895 surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a [[teratology|teratological]] perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been [[pygopagus]] (twins joined at the pelvis).{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}} Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each others' shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=247}} The pygopagus [[Millie and Christine McCoy]] had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=248}}{{#tag:ref|Millie and Christine McCoy, born into slavery in [[Columbus County, North Carolina]] in 1851, lived into their 60s and enjoyed a successful musical career under the stage name of "The Two Headed Nightingale".

They retired wealthy in 1900, dying of tuberculosis in 1912.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=248<U+2013>249}}|group=note}}

[[Jan Bondeson]] (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition,{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}} the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=220}}{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=259}} Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the [[Chronicon Scotorum]], the [[Annals of the Four Masters]] and the [[Annals of Clonmacnoise]] of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location.{{sfn|Bondeson|1992|p=221}} He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible,{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|pp=249<U+2013>50}} and agreed with Ballantyne's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=257}} He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the 18th century to fabricate the story.{{sfn|Bondeson|2006|p=257}}
