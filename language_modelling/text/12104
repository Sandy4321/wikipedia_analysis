'''Ignatz Urban''' (1848-1931) was a [[Germany|German]] [[botany|botanist]].  He is known for his contributions to the flora of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Brazil]], and for his work as curator of the [[Botanical Garden in Berlin|Berlin Botanical Garden]].  Born the son of a brewer, Urban showed an interest in botany as an undergraduate.  He pursued further study at the [[University of Bonn]] and later at the [[University of Berlin]] where he doctorate in 1873.  Urban was appointed by [[A. W. Eichler]] to run the Berlin Botanical Garden and supervised its move to [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]].  He also worked as Eichler's assistant on the ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'', later succeeding him as editor.  In 1884 Urban began working with [[Leopold Krug]] on his [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] collections, a collaboration would later produce the nine-volume ''[[Symbolae Antillanae]]'', one of his most important contributions, and his 30-part ''Sertum Antillanum''.  Urban's herbarium, estimated to include 80,000 or more sheets, was destroyed when the Berlin Herbarium was bombed in 1943, during the [[Second World War]].

==Early life and education==
Urban was born in [[Warburg]], [[Nordrhein Westfalen]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], in 1848, the son of a prosperous brewer.  He was educated at the local [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]], and later in [[Pederborn]] before proceeding to the [[University of Bonn]] and then the [[University of Berlin]].  He served in the military between 1869 and 1871 (seeing action in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]) before returning to his studies.  He received his [[doctor of philosophy|doctorate]] in 1873 and took up a teaching position in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]].<ref name = Howard>{{cite journal| last = Howard| first = Richard A.| authorlink = Richard A.

==Berlin Botanical Garden==
In 1878 Eichler was appointed head of Botany at the University of Berlin.  Eichler appointed Urban as assistant head of the Berlin Botanical Garden, and in 1883 he was promoted to the position of curator.  As curator of the Garden, Urban supervised their transfer from their original site to their present site in Berlin-Dahlem.<ref name = Howard/>  

==Flora of Brazil==
Urban worked as Eichler's assistant in the production of the ''[[Flora Brasiliensis]]'',<ref name = Howard/> which had been initiated by [[Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius]] and [[Stephan Endlicher]] in 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/biography/endlicher-stephan.html|title=Endlicher, Stephan L.

==Caribbean botany and ''Symbolae Antillanae''==
In 1884 Urban began working with [[Leopold Krug]] on his plant collections.  Krug was a German businessman based in [[Puerto Rico]] who had developed an interest in biology.  Together with his friend [[Domingo Bello y Espinosa]], Krug had accumulated a large collection of plants and had done a series of illustrations and plates. Returning to [[Berlin]] in 1876, Krug had worked with botanist [[Friz Kurtz]] to attempt to identify his collections.  When Bello published a portion of the work (which Krug had envisioned as a joint work), without reference to Krug's contributions, Krug was determined to publish his work.  After Kurtz emigrated to [[Argentina]] in 1884, Krug collaborated with Urban.<ref name = Howard/>

Krug hired plant collector [[Paul Sintenis]] to work in Puerto Rico, especially in the mountainous areas where Krug and Bello had made few collections.  Between 1884 and 1887 Sintenis made 8450 collections, the best of which were retained by Urban in Berlin.  The remainder were sold as duplicated to other collections, and the proceeds used by Urban to fund further collections.  With Krug's support Urban subsidised [[Henrik Franz Alexander von Eggers|Henrik von Eggers]] collections, and later helped secure support for [[Erik Ekman]]'s collections in [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]].  He also exchanged material extensively with other botanists and distributed fragments of his [[biological type|type]] collections so widely.  This became especially important after his original collections, estimated to consist of 80,000 sheets or more, were destroyed when the Berlin Herbarium was bombed in 1943, during [[World War II]].<ref name = Hiepko>{{cite journal| last = Hiepko| first = Paul| year = 1996| title = Collections in the Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem (B) of particular interest for the Flora of the Greater Antilles| journal = Flora of the Greater Antilles Newsletter| volume = 10| url = http://www.nybg.org/bsci/fga/Newsletter/FGANno10.htm}}</ref>

In 1886 Urban published his first paper primarily dedicated to Caribbean plants.  In 1898 he began the publication of ''Symbolae Antillanae seu fundamenta Florae Indiae Occidentalis''.  In 1913 he retired, having produced seven volumes of ''Symbolae Antillanae''.  He then began work on ''Sertum Antillanum'' which eventually became a 30-part series, completed in 1930.  Volume eight of ''Symbolae Antillanae'' was completed in 1921, and volume nine in 1928.<ref name = Howard/>

Urban continued working until a few weeks before his death in 1931, on the morning of this eighty-third birthday.<ref name = Howard/>
