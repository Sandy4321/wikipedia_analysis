'''Anders Martin-L<U+00F6>f''' , born 1940, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]]. He is a [[professor]] in [[insurance]] [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical statistics]] since 1987 at the Department of Mathematics of [[Stockholm University]].

Martin-L<U+00F6>f did his undergraduate studies at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] and got his exam in [[engineering physics]] in 1963. He continued with graduate studies in optimization at RIT and at [[MIT]] in the [[US]] during 1967/-68, later on followed by a position as Research Associate at the [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York]] 1970/-71, working with [[probability theory]] and applications to [[statistical mechanics]]. Back at RIT in Stockholm he received his [[Ph.D.]] degree in technology from RIT in 1973.

During the following 10 years he continued working with similar issues as "docent" in [[Uppsala]] and Stockholm. In the 1980-ies he changed to insurance mathematics with the [[Folksam]] company including development of theories for controlling movements of insurances. From 1987 he has been working with theoretical and applied aspects of his assignement as professor with the Stockholm University.

Martin-L<U+00F6>f has two children from his first marriage and a grown daughter from his second. Anders is the brother of [[Per Martin-L<U+00F6>f]], who was responsible for a pioneering definition of [[randomness]], as well as a foundation for constructive mathematics based on [[intuitionistic type theory]]. Per is also a professor at Stockholm University, with joint appointments in the departments of Mathematics and Philosophy. They share an interest in statistics, and in statistical mechanics, though Per has been more interested in the foundations of statistics, while Anders has been more interested in [[mathematical finance|financial mathematics]]. Their elder brother Johan is also an engineering physicist but more inclined to [[space technology]].

Martin-L<U+00F6>f was a fellow student at RIT with [[Olav Kallenberg]].
