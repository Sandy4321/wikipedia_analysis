The '''Music Association of Ireland''' was set up in 1948 to improve the position of [[classical music]] within the cultural life of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In 2007, it changed its name to Friends of Classical Music.

==Early years==
In May 1948 it was announced that a new body, to be known as the Music Association of Ireland, was being set up to promote [[classical music]] in Ireland.<ref name="IT1">''The Irish Times'', "New Group To Promote Music", 21 May 1948</ref><ref>''Irish Independent'', "New music association", 25 May 1948</ref> The new association had six objectives:
#to further musical education
#to improve conditions for composers and musicians
#to help establish a national concert hall
#to lobby on matters of music policy
#to encourage musical groups throughout the country
#to organise concerts and lectures.<ref name="IT1"/>
A governing council of thirteen individuals was set up to oversee the running of the association. Among its members were composers, [[Brian Boydell]], [[Aloys Fleischman]], and [[Frederick May (composer)|Frederick May]].<ref name="IT1"/>

Six months after its formation the Association had gained only eighty three members. Nevertheless, it immediately began to lobby government for greater financial support for live performances, particularly those given by the [[RT<U+00C9> National Symphony Orchestra|Radio <U+00C9>ireann Symphony Orchestra]]<ref>''Sunday Independent'', "Those symphony concerts", 7 November 1948</ref> 

In 1950 the association undertook its greatest challenge to date when it organised a festival of concerts and lectures to commemorate the [[bicentenary]] of the death of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. For several months, members raised funds<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Backers for Bach wanted", 27 May 1950</ref> and tried to source instruments, such as a [[harpsichord]], not readily available in Ireland.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "An Irishman's Diary", 29 June 1950</ref> The festival took place between September and November 1950 in various Dublin venues and featured local and international performers. For instance, English [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], [[Owen Brannigan]], sang in the [[B Minor Mass]], and the principal and second trumpeters of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] were engaged to play the D [[trumpet]]s in the same work.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Bach bi-centenary commemoration", 27 September 1950</ref> While individual aspects of performance were criticised, the intiative was generally welcomed.<ref>''Irish Press'', "Concert in memory of J. S. Bach", 23 October 1950</ref>

==Activities==
===National Concert Hall===
The Music Association of Ireland began its campaign for a national concert hall in 1951.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Committee To Discuss Concert Hall For Dublin", 27 January 1951</ref> In 1960, music critic [[Charles Acton (critic)|Charles Acton]] put the weight of his prominent position at ''[[The Irish Times]]'' behind the effort. At that point, a brand new building was being mooted, to be located opposite [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church Cathedral]] in Dublin.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "A national concert hall'', 14 January 1960</ref> In 1964, the government announced that a new national concert hall would be built in Dublin as a memorial to the late American president, [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Music Association praises concert hall decision", 15 February 1964</ref> When, by 1973, no progess had been made, the association collected 10,000 signatures in support of a new concert hall and submitted their petition to the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]].<ref>''The Irish Times'', "National concert hall appeal", 19 October 1973</ref> Finally, in September 1981, the association's efforts were crowned with success when the country's new [[National Concert Hall]] opened in Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin.<ref>''Irish Independent'', "The Concert Hall", 19 August 1981</ref>

===Concerts===
Among the notable artists who performed in Ireland under the auspices of the association were:
*[[Benjamin Britten]] and [[Peter Pears]] (1960)<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Benjamin Britten to give Dublin recital", 22 April 1960</ref>
*[[Victoria de los <U+00C1>ngeles]] (1969)<ref>''The Irish Times'', p. 4</ref>
*[[Yvonne Loriod]] (1976)<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Festival of 20th-Century Music", 3 January 1976</ref>

The Music Association of Ireland organised a number of regular music festivals, including the Festival of 20th Century Music, the Festival in Great Irish Houses, and the Dublin Organ Festival. However, by the late 1980s, the association was no longer able to support these events when funding from the [[Arts Council of Ireland|Arts Council]] ceased.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Music Highs and Lows of 1986", 1 January 1987</ref>

==Current status==
The association continued to organise concerts and lectures into the early years of the third millennium, but on a less ambitious scale.<ref>''The Irish Times'', 7 November 2002, p. B25</ref> In 2007, the Music Association of Ireland changed its name to Friends of Classical Music.<ref>''The Irish Times'', "Neglect of classical music", 12 October 2007</ref>
