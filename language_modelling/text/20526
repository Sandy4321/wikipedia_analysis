The '''Emancipation Proclamation''' is an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] issued by United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on January 1, 1863, during the [[American Civil War]] under his war powers. It proclaimed the freedom of 3.1 million of the nation's 4 million slaves, and immediately freed 50,000 of them, with the rest freed as [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] armies advanced.<ref>according to Eric Foner, ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery'' (2010) pp 239-42
</ref>
On September 22, 1862, Lincoln had previously announced that he would issue a formal emancipation of all slaves in any state of the [[Confederate States of America]] that did not return to Union control by January 1, 1863.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard M. Juang|title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wFrAOqfhuGYC|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094417|page=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=wFrAOqfhuGYC&pg=PA413 413]}}</ref> None did return and the actual order, signed and issued January 1, 1863, took effect except in locations where the Union had already mostly regained control. The Proclamation made abolition a central goal of the war (in addition to reunion), angered many Northern Democrats, energized anti-slavery forces, and weakened forces in Europe that wanted to intervene to help the Confederacy.  Total abolition of slavery was finalized by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] of 1865.

==Authority==

Lincoln issued the Proclamation under his authority as "[[Commander-in-chief|Commander in Chief]] of the Army and Navy" under Article II, section 2 of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref>Crowther p. 651</ref> As such, he had the martial power to suspend civil law in those states which were in rebellion. He did not have Commander-in-Chief authority over the four slave-holding states that had not seceded: Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware. The Proclamation was never challenged in court. To ensure the abolition of slavery everywhere in the U.S., Lincoln pushed for passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Congress passed it by the necessary 2/3 vote in February 1865 and it  was ratified by the states by December 1865.<ref>{{cite web|author=Allen C. Guelzo|title="The Great Event of the Nineteenth Century": Lincoln Issues the Emancipation Proclamation|url=http://www.hsp.org/node/2974 | work = The Historical Society of Pennsylvania | accessdate = May 7, 2011]}}</ref>

==Coverage==
[[File:Am Arch Sculpt 4.jpg|thumb|The moment portrayed by [[Lee Lawrie]] in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]]]
The Proclamation applied only in ten states that were still in rebellion in 1863, thus it did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] (Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland or Delaware) which were Union states &mdash; those slaves were freed by separate state and federal actions. The state of [[Tennessee]] had already mostly returned to Union control, so it was not named and was exempted. [[Virginia]] was named, but exemptions were specified for the 48 counties then in the process of forming the new state of [[West Virginia]], seven additional Tidewater{{clarify|date=April 2011|reason=globalize}} counties individually named, and two cities. Also specifically exempted were [[New Orleans]] and 13 named parishes of [[Louisiana]], all of which were also already mostly under Federal control at the time of the Proclamation. These exemptions left unemancipated an additional 300,000 slaves.<ref>Foner (2010) pp.241-242</ref>

The Emancipation Proclamation was ridiculed for freeing only the slaves over which the Union had no power. Over 50,000 were freed the day it went into effect<ref name=SIFBEP/> in parts of nine of the ten states to which it applied (Texas being the exception).<ref name=AEPLRES>William C. Harris, "After the Emancipation Proclamation: Lincoln's Role in the Ending of Slavery", North & South vol. 5 no. 1 (December 2001), map on p.&nbsp;49</ref> In every Confederate state (except Tennessee and Texas), the Proclamation went into immediate effect in Union-occupied areas and at least 20,000 slaves<ref name=SIFBEP /><ref name=AEPLRES /> were freed at once on January 1, 1863.

Additionally, the Proclamation provided the legal framework for the emancipation of nearly all four million slaves as the Union armies advanced, and committed the Union to ending slavery, which was a controversial decision even in the North. Hearing of the Proclamation, more slaves quickly escaped to Union lines as the Army units moved South. As the Union armies advanced through the Confederacy, thousands of slaves were freed each day until nearly all (approximately 4 million, according to the 1860 census)<ref name=1860Census>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/slavery/slave-maps/slave-census.htm  |title=Census, Son of the South |author= |year=1860 |work= |publisher=sonofthesouth.net |accessdate= }}</ref> were freed by July 1865.

Near the end of the war, [[abolitionist]]s were concerned that while the Proclamation had freed most slaves as a war measure, it had not made slavery illegal. Several former slave states had already passed legislation prohibiting slavery; however, in a few states, slavery continued to be legal, and to exist, until December 18, 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment was enacted.

==Background==
{{Emancipation Proclamation draft}}
The [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] required individuals to return runaway slaves to their owners. During the war, Union generals such as [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], declared that slaves in occupied areas were [[contraband (American Civil War)|contraband of war]] and accordingly refused to return them.<ref name="NYT_20110411">{{cite news

</ref>
This decision was controversial because it implied recognition of the Confederacy as a separate nation under international law, a notion that Lincoln steadfastly denied. As a result, he did not promote the contraband designation. Some generals also declared the slaves under their jurisdiction to be free and were replaced when they refused to rescind such declarations.

In January 1862, [[Thaddeus Stevens]], the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] leader in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]], called for total war against the rebellion to include emancipation of slaves, arguing that emancipation, by forcing the loss of enslaved labor, would ruin the rebel economy. On March 13, 1862, Congress approved a "Law Enacting an Additional Article of War" which stated that from that point onward it was forbidden for Union Army officers to return fugitive slaves to their owners.<ref>{{cite book|first=U.S., Statutes at Large, Treaties, and Proclamations of the United States of America, vol. 12 (Boston, 1863), p. 354.}}</ref>  On April 10, 1862, Congress declared that the federal government would compensate slave owners who freed their slaves. Slaves in the [[Geography of Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] were freed on April 16, 1862, and their owners were compensated.

On June 19, 1862, Congress prohibited slavery in United States territories, and President Lincoln quickly signed the legislation. By this act, they opposed the 1857 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford|Dred Scott Case]]'' that Congress was powerless to regulate slavery in U.S. territories.<ref>Guminski, Arnold.

In July 1862, Congress passed and Lincoln signed the "Second Confiscation Act." It purported to liberate slaves held by "rebels",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/conact2.htm |title=The Second Confiscation Act, July 17, 1862 |publisher=History.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> but Lincoln took the position that Congress lacked power to free slaves within the borders of the states unless Lincoln as commander in chief deemed it a proper military measure.<ref>Donald, David.

[[Abolitionism|Abolitionists]] had long been urging Lincoln to free all slaves. A mass rally in Chicago on September 7, 1862, demanded an immediate and universal emancipation of slaves. A delegation headed by [[William W. Patton]] met the President at the [[White House]] on September 13. Lincoln had declared in peacetime that he had no constitutional authority to free the slaves. Even used as a war power, emancipation was a risky political act. Public opinion as a whole was against it.<ref>Guelzo, Allen C. ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation'', 2004, pg. 18</ref> There would be strong opposition among [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] Democrats and an uncertain reaction from loyal border states. Delaware and Maryland already had a high percentage of free blacks: 91.2% and 49.7%, respectively, in 1860.<ref>Peter Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619<U+2013>1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p.82</ref>

==Drafting and issuance of the proclamation==
Lincoln first discussed the proclamation with his cabinet in July 1862. He believed he needed a Union victory on the battlefield so his decision would appear positive and strong. The [[Battle of Antietam]], in which Union troops turned back a Confederate invasion of Maryland, gave him the opportunity to issue a preliminary proclamation on September 22, 1862. Lincoln had first shown an early draft of the proclamation to his Vice president [[Hannibal Hamlin]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangorinfo.com/Focus/focus_hannibal_hamlin.html |title=Bangor In Focus: Hannibal Hamlin |publisher=Bangorinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> an ardent abolitionist, who was more often kept in the dark on presidential decisions. The final proclamation was issued January 1, 1863. Although implicitly granted authority by Congress, Lincoln used his powers as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, "as a necessary war measure" as the basis of the proclamation, rather than the equivalent of a statute enacted by Congress or a constitutional amendment.

[[Image:EmancipationProclamation.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of the Emancipation Proclamation at the [[National Underground Railroad Freedom Center]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]].      ('''''[http://toolserver.org/~dschwen/iip/wip.php?f=EmancipationProclamation.jpg Zoom]''''')]]
Initially, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively freed only a small percentage of the slaves, those who were behind Union lines in areas not exempted. Most slaves were still behind Confederate lines or in exempted Union-occupied areas. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] commented, "We show our sympathy with slavery by emancipating slaves where we cannot reach them and holding them in bondage where we can set them free." Had any slave state ended its secession attempt before January 1, 1863, it could have kept slavery, at least temporarily. The Proclamation only gave Lincoln the legal basis to free the slaves in the areas of the South that were still in rebellion. However, it also took effect as the Union armies advanced into the Confederacy.

The Emancipation Proclamation also allowed for the enrollment of freed slaves into the United States military. During the war nearly 200,000 blacks, most of them ex-slaves, joined the Union Army. Their contributions gave the North additional manpower that was significant in winning the war. The Confederacy did not allow slaves in their army as soldiers until the final months before its defeat.

Though the counties of Virginia that were soon to form [[West Virginia]] were specifically exempted from the Proclamation (Jefferson County being the only exception), a condition of the state's admittance to the Union was that its constitution provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. Slaves in the border states of [[Maryland]] and [[Missouri]] were also emancipated by separate state action before the Civil War ended. In Maryland, a new state constitution abolishing slavery in the state went into effect on November 1, 1864. In early 1865, Tennessee adopted an amendment to its constitution prohibiting slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm |title=Freedmen and Southern Society Project: Chronology of Emancipation |publisher=History.umd.edu |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm |title=TSLA: This Honorable Body: African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee |publisher=State.tn.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}</ref> Slaves in [[Kentucky]] and [[Delaware]] were not emancipated until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified.

==Implementation==
[[Image:Emancipation Proclamation.PNG|thumb|right|Areas covered by the Emancipation Proclamation are in red. Slave holding areas not covered are in blue.]]
The Proclamation was issued in two parts. The first part, issued on September 22, 1862, was a preliminary announcement outlining the intent of the second part, which officially went into effect 100 days later on January 1, 1863, during the second year of the Civil War. It was Abraham Lincoln's declaration that all slaves would be permanently freed in all areas of the Confederacy that had not already returned to federal control by January 1863. The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[slave state]]s of [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]]. Also not named was the state of [[Tennessee]], which was at the time more or less evenly split between Union and Confederacy. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become [[West Virginia]], seven other named counties of [[Virginia]] including Berkeley and Hampshire counties which were soon added to West Virginia, [[New Orleans]] and 13 named parishes nearby.

Union-occupied areas of the Confederate states where the proclamation was put into immediate effect by local commanders included Winchester, Virginia,<ref>Richard Duncan, Beleaguered Winchester: A Virginia Community at War (Baton Rouge, LA: LSU Press, 2007), pp. 139<U+2013>40</ref> Corinth, Mississippi,<ref>Ira Berlin et al., eds, Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861<U+2013>1867, Vol. 1: The Destruction of Slavery (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 260</ref> the Sea Islands along the coasts of the Carolinas and Georgia,<ref>William Klingaman, Abraham Lincoln and the Road to Emancipation, 1861<U+2013>1865 (NY: Viking Press, 2001), p. 234</ref> Key West, Florida,<ref>"Important From Key West", New York Times February 4, 1863, p. 1</ref> and Port Royal, South Carolina.<ref name="New York Times January 9, 1863, p. 2">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1863/01/09/news/interesting-port-royal-jubliee-among-negroes-first-president-s-emancipation.html?scp=35&sq=&st=p?pagewanted=1 |title=Interesting from Port Royal |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 9, 1863 |page=2 | first=Our | last=Own}}</ref>

===Immediate impact===
[[File:SlaveChildrenUnknown.jpg|thumb|upright|A circa 1870 photograph of two children who were likely recently emancipated.]]

It is common to encounter a claim that the Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately free a single slave.  As a result of the Proclamation, many slaves were freed during the course of the war, beginning with the day it took effect. Eyewitness accounts at places such as Hilton Head, South Carolina,<ref>"News from South Carolina: Negro Jubilee at Hilton Head", ''New York Herald'', January 7, 1863, p.5</ref> and Port Royal, South Carolina,<ref name="New York Times January 9, 1863, p. 2"/> record celebrations on January 1 as thousands of blacks were informed of their new legal status of freedom.

Estimates of the number of slaves freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation are uncertain.  One contemporary estimate put the 'contraband' population of Union-occupied North Carolina at 10,000, and the Sea Islands of South Carolina also had a substantial population.  Those 20,000 slaves were freed immediately by the Emancipation Proclamation."<ref name=SIFBEP>Keith Poulter, "Slaves Immediately Freed by the Emancipation Proclamation", ''North & South'' vol. 5 no. 1 (December 2001), p. 48</ref>
This Union-occupied zone where freedom began at once included parts of  eastern North Carolina, the Mississippi Valley, northern Alabama, the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, a large part  of Arkansas, and the Sea Islands of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Harris, "After the Emancipation Proclamation", p. 45</ref>  Although some counties of Union-occupied Virginia were exempted from the Proclamation, the lower Shenandoah Valley, and the area around Alexandria were covered.<ref name=SIFBEP />

[[Booker T. Washington]], as a boy of 9 in Virginia, remembered the day in early 1865:<ref>''Up from Slavery'' (1901) pp 19-21</ref>
{{quote
|As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave quarters than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom.... Some man who seemed to be a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper<U+2014>the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, leaned over and kissed her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks. She explained to us what it all meant, that this was the day for which she had been so long praying, but fearing that she would never live to see.}}

The Emancipation took place without violence by masters or ex-slaves. The proclamation represented a shift in the war objectives of the North<U+2014>reuniting the nation was no longer the only goal. It represented a major step toward the ultimate abolition of [[slavery in the United States]] and a "new birth of freedom".

Runaway slaves who had escaped to Union lines had previously been held by the Union Army as "contraband of war" under the [[Confiscation Acts]]; when the proclamation took effect, they were told at midnight that they were free to leave. The [[Sea Islands]] off the coast of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] had been occupied by the Union Navy earlier in the war. The whites had fled to the mainland while the blacks stayed. An early program of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was set up for the former slaves, including schools and training. Naval officers read the proclamation and told them they were free.

In the military, reaction to the proclamation varied widely, with some units nearly ready to mutiny in protest. Some desertions were attributed to it. Other units were inspired by the adoption of a cause that ennobled their efforts, such that at least one unit took up the motto "For Union and Liberty".

Slaves had been part of the "engine of war" for the Confederacy. They produced and prepared food; sewed uniforms; repaired railways; worked on farms and in factories, shipping yards, and mines; built fortifications; and served as hospital workers and common laborers. News of the Proclamation spread rapidly by word of mouth, arousing hopes of freedom, creating general confusion, and encouraging thousands to escape to Union lines.

The Proclamation was immediately denounced by [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead Democrats]] who opposed the war and advocated restoring the union by allowing slavery. [[Horatio Seymour]], while running for the governorship of New York, cast the Emancipation Proclamation as a call for slaves to commit extreme acts of violence on all white southerners, he said it was "a proposal for the butchery of women and children, for scenes of lust and rapine, and of arson and murder, which would invoke the interference of civilized Europe."<ref name="Weber">{{cite book|title=Copperheads: the rise and fall of Lincoln's opponents in the North|author=Jennifer L. Weber|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|year=2006}}</ref> The Copperheads also saw the Proclamation as an unconstitutional abuse of Presidential power, editor Henry A. Reeves wrote in Greenport's ''Republican Watchman'' that "In the name of freedom of Negroes, [the proclamation] imperils the liberty of white men; to test a utopian theory of equality of races which Nature, History and Experience alike condemn as monstrous, it overturns the Constitution and Civil Laws and sets up Military Usurpation in their Stead."<ref name="Weber"/>

Racism remained pervasive on both sides of the conflict and many in the North only supported the war as an effort to force the south back into the Union. The promises of many Republican politicians that the war was to restore the Union and not about black rights or ending slavery were now declared lies by their opponents citing the Proclamation. Copperhead David Allen spoke to a rally in Columbiana, Ohio, stating "I have told you that this war is carried on for the Negro. There is the proclamation of the President of the United States. Now fellow Democrats I ask you if you are going to be forced into a war against your Brethren of the Southern States for the Negro. I answer No!"<ref name="Weber"/> The Copperheads saw the Proclamation as irrefutable proof of their position and the beginning of a political rise for their members; in Connecticut H.B. Whiting wrote that the truth was now plain even to "those stupid thick-headed persons who persisted in thinking that the President was a conservative man and that the war was for the restoration of the Union under the Constitution."<ref name="Weber"/>

[[War Democrats]] who rejected the Copperhead position within their party, found themselves in a quandary. While throughout the war they had continued to espouse the racist positions of their party and their disdain of the concerns of slaves, they did see the Proclamation as a viable military tool against the South and worried that opposing it might demoralize troops in the Union army. The question would continue to trouble them and eventually lead to a split within their party as the war progressed.<ref name="Weber"/>

Lincoln further alienated many in the Union two days after issuing the preliminary copy of the Emancipation Proclamation by [[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|suspending habeas corpus]]. His opponents linked these two actions in their claims that he was becoming a despot. In light of this and a lack of military success for the Union armies, many War Democrat voters who had previously supported Lincoln turned against him and joined the Copperheads in the off-year elections held in October and November.<ref name="Weber"/>

In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1862|1862 elections]], the Democrats gained 28 seats in the House as well as the governorship of [[New York]]. Lincoln<U+2019>s friend Orville Hickman Browning told the President that the Proclamation and the suspension of habeas corpus had been "disastrous" for his party by handing the Democrats so many weapons. Lincoln made no response. Copperhead William Javis of Connecticut pronounced the election the "beginning of the end of the utter downfall of [[Abolitionism]]."<ref name="Weber"/>

Historians James M. McPherson and Allan Nevins state that though the results look very troubling, they could be seen favorably by Lincoln; his opponents did well only in their historic strongholds and "at the national level their gains in the House were the smallest of any minority party<U+2019>s in an off-year election in nearly a generation. Michigan, California, and Iowa all went Republican...Moreover, the Republicans picked up five seats in the Senate."<ref name="Weber"/> McPherson states "If the election was in any sense a referendum on emancipation and on Lincoln<U+2019>s conduct of the war, a majority of Northern voters endorsed these policies."<ref name="Weber"/>

===International impact===
As Lincoln had hoped, the Proclamation turned foreign popular opinion in favor of the Union by adding the ending of slavery as a goal of the war. That shift ended the Confederacy's hopes of gaining official recognition, particularly from the [[United Kingdom]], which had abolished slavery.  Prior to Lincoln's decree, Britain's actions had favored the Confederacy, especially in its provision of British-built warships such as the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] and [[CSS Florida (cruiser)|CSS ''Florida'']]. Furthermore, the North's determination to win at all costs was creating problems diplomatically; the [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 had caused severe tensions between the United States and Great Britain.  For the Confederacy to receive official recognition by foreign powers would have been a further blow to the Union cause.

With the war now cast in terms of freedom against slavery, British or French support for the Confederacy would look like support for slavery, which both of these nations had abolished. As [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] noted, "The Emancipation Proclamation has done more for us than all our former victories and all our diplomacy." In Italy, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] hailed Lincoln as "the heir of the aspirations of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]". On August 6, 1863 Garibaldi wrote to Lincoln: ''Posterity will call you the great emancipator, a more enviable title than any crown could be, and greater than any merely mundane treasure''.<ref>Mack Smith, p. 72</ref>

Alan Van Dyke, a representative for workers from [[Manchester]], England, wrote to Lincoln saying, "We joyfully honor you for many decisive steps toward practically exemplifying your belief in the words of your great founders: 'All men are created free and equal.'" The Emancipation Proclamation served to ease tensions with Europe over the North's conduct of the war, and combined with the recent failed Southern offensive at [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] to cut off any practical chance for the Confederacy to receive international support in the war.

===Gettysburg Address===
Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in November 1863 made indirect reference to the Proclamation and the ending of slavery as a war goal with the phrase "new birth of freedom". The Proclamation solidified Lincoln's support among the rapidly growing abolitionist element of the Republican Party and ensured they would not block his re-nomination in 1864.<ref>Allan Nevins, ''Ordeal of the Union: vol 6. War Becomes Revolution, 1862<U+2013>1863'' (1960)</ref>

Near the end of the war, abolitionists were concerned that the Emancipation Proclamation would be construed solely as a war act and no longer apply once fighting ended. They were also increasingly anxious to secure the freedom of all slaves, not just those freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Thus pressed, Lincoln staked a large part of his 1864 presidential campaign on a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery uniformly throughout the United States. Lincoln's campaign was bolstered by separate votes in both Maryland and Missouri to abolish slavery in those states. Maryland's new constitution abolishing slavery took effect in November 1864. Slavery in Missouri was ended by executive proclamation of its governor, Thomas C. Fletcher, on January 11, 1865.

Winning re-election, Lincoln pressed the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to pass the proposed amendment immediately rather than wait for the incoming [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene. In January 1865, Congress sent to the state legislatures for ratification what became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], banning slavery in all [[U.S. state]]s and territories. The amendment was ratified by the legislatures of enough states by December 6, 1865, and proclaimed 12 days later. There were about 40,000 slaves in Kentucky and 1,000 in Delaware who were liberated then.<ref name="1860Census"/>

==Legacy==
In the years after Lincoln's death, his action in the proclamation was lauded. The anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation was celebrated as a black holiday for more than 50 years; the holiday of [[Juneteenth]] was created in some states to honor it.<ref>Guelzo, p. 244.</ref> In 1913, the 50th anniversary of the Proclamation, there were particularly large celebrations.

As the years went on and American life continued to be deeply unfair towards blacks, cynicism towards Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation increased. Some 20th century black intellectuals, including [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and [[Julius Lester]], described the proclamation as essentially worthless. Perhaps the strongest attack was [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett's]] ''[[Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream]]'' (2000), which claimed that Lincoln was a white supremacist who issued the Emancipation Proclamation in lieu of the real racial reforms for which radical abolitionists pushed.
In his ''Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation'', [[Allen C. Guelzo]] noted the professional historians' lack of substantial respect for the document, since it has been the subject of few major scholarly studies. He argued that Lincoln was America's "last [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[politician]]"<ref>Guelzo, p. 3.</ref> and as such was dedicated to removing slavery strictly within the bounds of law.

Other historians have given more credit to Lincoln for what he accomplished within the tensions of his cabinet and a society at war, for his own growth in political and moral stature, and for the promise he held out to the slaves.<ref>Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''A Team of Rivals'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005</ref> More might have been accomplished if he had not been assassinated. As [[Eric Foner]] wrote:
<blockquote>Lincoln was not an abolitionist or [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]], a point Bennett reiterates innumerable times. He did not favor immediate abolition before the war, and held [[racist]] views typical of his time. But he was also a man of deep convictions when it came to slavery, and during the Civil War displayed a remarkable capacity for moral and political growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ericfoner.com/reviews/040900latimes.html |title=review of ''Forced into Glory: Abraham Lincoln's White Dream'' by Lerone Bennett, Jr. |first=Eric |last=Foner |publisher=Los Angeles Times Book Review |date=April 9, 2000 |accessdate=Jun 30, 2008}}</ref></blockquote>
