'''''Against''''' is the seventh studio album by the [[Brazil]]ian [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Sepultura]], released in 1998 through [[Roadrunner Records]]. It is the band's first release with new frontman [[Derrick Green]], who replaced group founder [[Max Cavalera]] in 1997.

==Album information==
Like ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]'' that preceded it, the album has a variety of guest musicians and incorporates tribal influences <U+2013> Japanese percussion elements are added with the assistance of Japanese [[taiko]] group [[Kodo (taiko group)|Kodo]].

The songs "Against", "Choke" and "[[Tribus (song)|Tribus]]" were released as singles, with a music video accompanying "Choke". The video featured footage from the ''Barulho Contra Fome'' (''Noise Against Hunger'') concert that was the first gig of the ''Against'' tour. This performance included guest appearances from the [[Xavantes]] tribe, who had featured on ''Roots'' (as documented in the "Choke" video) as well as [[Mike Patton]], [[Jason Newsted]], [[Carlinhos Brown]], original Sepultura guitarist [[Jairo Guedz]] and [[Coffin Joe]] (whose "blessing" of the band performed during this concert turned up as a B-side entitled "Pren<U+00FA>ncio" on the [[Tribus (song)|''Tribus'']] EP).

The flute section of "Kamaitachi" performed by Kodo is heavily based on that in "The Hunted" which appeared on Kodo's ''[[Ibuki (Kod<U+014D> album)|Ibuki]]'' album and was originally composed for the soundtrack of the [[The Hunted (1995 film)|movie of the same name]]. The song "The Waste" (a vocal version of "Kamaitachi" featuring [[Mike Patton]] on vocals which appeared on the single B-sides) is featured in the movie ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' and its soundtrack.

The band supported [[Metallica]] in the latter's May 1999 tour in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/brazil/minas+gerais/belo+horizonte/sepultura1 |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: SEPULTURA |publisher=Rockdetector.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>
