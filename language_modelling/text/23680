'''Route 77''' is a [[state highway]] in the southern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]]. It runs {{convert|22.55|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 49|Route 49]] in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey|Bridgeton]], [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] north to an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 45|Route 45]] in [[Mullica Hill, New Jersey|Mullica Hill]], [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]]. It is a mostly two-lane, undivided road traversing through farmland in Cumberland, [[Salem County, New Jersey|Salem]], and Gloucester Counties. Along the way, Route 77 intersects [[New Jersey Route 56|Route 56]] in [[Upper Deerfield Township, New Jersey|Upper Deerfield Township]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 40]] in [[Upper Pittsgrove Township, New Jersey|Upper Pittsgrove Township]].

Prior to 1927, the route was a branch of [[Pre-1927 Route 6 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 6]] that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In 1927, it was designated as '''Route 46''', which replaced the Bridgeton-Mullica Hill branch of pre-1927 Route 6. In 1953, it was renumbered to Route 77 to avoid conflicting with [[U.S. Route 46]] in the northern part of the state.
