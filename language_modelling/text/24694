'''Flavius Belisarius''' ({{lang-el|<U+0392><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03AC><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ca. 500<ref>The exact date of his birth is unknown. PLRE III, p. 182</ref>&nbsp;<U+2013> 565) was one of the greatest [[general]]s of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire]]. He was instrumental to [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Justinian]]'s ambitious project of reconquering much of the Mediterranean territory of the former [[Western Roman Empire]], which had been lost less than a century previously.

One of the defining features of Belisarius' career was his success despite the little or no support he received from his emperor. He is also among a select group of men considered to be the "[[Last of the Romans]]".

==Early life and career==
Belisarius was probably born in ''Germane'' or ''Germania'', a city that once stood on the site of present day [[Sapareva Banya]] in south-west [[Bulgaria]]. He may have been of [[Greeks|Greek]] or [[Thracians|Thracian]] ancestry.<ref>The hypothesis that he was of Romanized [[Slavs|Slavic]] ancestry, on the grounds that his name is somewhat similar to the Slavic "Beli Tsar" ("White Prince"), has been rejected by contemporary historians, as the word ''[[tsar]]'' was first used in the 10th century, well after Belisarius' death.  Whether the ''sar-'' particle nevertheless derives from "Caesar" (as does "Tsar"), or from the earlier etymological roots (''sar'' is "king"/"prince"/"ruler" in various older Semitic languages) is not attested.</ref> He became a Roman soldier as a young man, serving in the bodyguard of the Emperor [[Justin I]]. Following Justin's death in 527, the new [[Emperor]], [[Justinian I]], appointed Belisarius to command the Byzantine army in the east to deal with incursions from the [[Sassanid Empire]]. He quickly proved himself an able and effective commander, defeating the larger Sassanid army through superior generalship. In June 530, during the [[Iberian War]], he led the Byzantines to a stunning victory over the Sassanids in the [[Battle of Dara]], followed by a close defeat at the [[Battle of Callinicum]] on the [[Euphrates]] in 531. This led to the negotiation of an "Endless Peace" with the Persians and heavy [[tributes]] for years in exchange for a peace treaty.

In 532, he was the highest-ranking military officer in the Imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] when the [[Nika riots]] broke out in the city (among factions of [[chariot racing]] fans) and nearly resulted in the overthrow of Justinian. Belisarius, with the help of the ''[[magister militum]]'' of [[Illyria]], [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]], along with the generals [[Narses]] and [[John the Armenian]] suppressed the rebellion with a bloodbath in the Hippodrome, the gathering place of the rebels, that is said to have claimed the lives of 30,000 people.

==Military campaigns==

===Against the Vandals===
{{main|Vandalic War}}
For his efforts, Belisarius was rewarded by Justinian with the command of a great land and sea expedition against the [[Vandal Kingdom]], mounted in 533-534. The Byzantines had political, religious, and strategic reasons for such a campaign. The pro-Byzantine Vandal king [[Hilderic]] had been deposed and murdered by the usurper [[Gelimer]], giving Justinian a legal pretext. Furthermore, the [[Arianism|Arian]] Vandals had periodically persecuted the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christians]] within their kingdom, many of whom made their way to Constantinople seeking redress. The Vandals had launched many pirate raids on Byzantine trade interests, hurting commerce in the western areas of the Empire. Justinian also wanted control of the Vandal territory in [[north Africa]], which was vital for guaranteeing Byzantine access to the western [[Mediterranean]].

In the late summer of 533, Belisarius sailed to [[Africa]] and landed near the city of [[Leptis Magna]]. He ordered his fleet not to lose sight of the army, then marched along the coastal highway toward the Vandal capital of [[Carthage]]. He did this to prevent supplies from being cut off, and to avoid a great defeat such as occurred in the first attempt to retake northern Africa 35 years before.

Ten miles from Carthage, the forces of Gelimer (who had just executed Hilderic) and Belisarius finally met at the [[Battle of Ad Decimum]] on September 13, 533. It nearly turned into a defeat for the Byzantines. Gelimer had chosen his position well and had some success along the main road. The Byzantines, however, seemed dominant on both sides of the main road to Carthage. At the height of the battle, Gelimer became distraught upon learning of the death of his brother in battle. This gave Belisarius a chance to regroup, and he went on to win the battle and capture Carthage. A second victory at the [[Battle of Tricamarum]] in December 15 of the same year resulted in Gelimer's surrender early in 534 at [[Mount Papua]], restoring the lost Roman provinces of north Africa to the empire. For this achievement, Belisarius was granted a [[Roman triumph]] (the last ever given) when he returned to Constantinople. According to [[Procopius]], if he is to be believed, in the procession were paraded the spoils of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], which had been recovered from the Vandal capital along with Gelimer himself before he was sent into peaceful exile. Medals were stamped in his honor with the inscription ''Gloria Romanorum'', though none seem to have come down to modern times. Belisarius was also made sole [[consul]] in 534, being one of the last individuals ever to hold this office, which was by this time merely a ceremonial relic of the ancient [[Roman Republic]].

Nevertheless, the recovery of Africa was not complete; army mutinies and revolts by the native [[Berbers]] would plague the new [[praetorian prefecture of Africa]] for almost 15 years.

===Against the Ostrogoths===
{{main|Gothic War (535<U+2013>554)}}
Justinian now resolved to restore as much of the [[Western Roman Empire]] as he could. In 535, he commissioned Belisarius to attack the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy. Belisarius landed in Sicily and took the island for use as a base against Italy, while [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]] recovered [[Dalmatia]]. The preparations for the invasion of the Italian mainland were interrupted in Easter 536, when Belisarius sailed to Africa to counter an uprising of the local army. His reputation made the rebels abandon the siege of Carthage, and Belisarius pursued and defeated them at Membresa. Thereupon he returned to Sicily, and then crossed into [[Italy]] proper, where he captured [[Naples]] and [[Rome]] in 536.

The following year, he successfully [[Siege of Rome (537-538)|defended Rome]] against the Goths and moved north to take Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of [[Ravenna]] in 540, where the Goth king [[Witiges]] was captured. Shortly before to the taking of Ravenna, the Ostrogoths offered to make Belisarius the western emperor. Belisarius feigned acceptance and entered Ravenna via its sole point of entry, a causeway through the marshes, accompanied by his comitatus (veterans). Once inside the city, Belisarius quickly seized Witiges and then capitalized on the resulting lack of leadership to secure the city. Thereupon, he proclaimed the capture of Ravenna in the name of the Emperor Justinian.

The Goths' offer perhaps raised suspicions in Justinian's mind and Belisarius was recalled to deal with the Persian conquest of [[Syria]], a crucial province of the empire. Belisarius took the field and waged a brief, inconclusive campaign in 541-542. He eventually managed to negotiate a truce (aided with the payment of a large sum of money, 5,000 pounds of gold), in which the Persians agreed not to attack Byzantine territory for the next five years.

Belisarius returned to Italy in 544, where he found that the situation had changed greatly. In 541 the Ostrogoths had elected [[Totila]] as their new leader and had mounted a vigorous campaign against the Byzantines, recapturing all of northern Italy and even driving the Byzantines out of Rome. Belisarius managed to recover Rome briefly but his Italian campaign proved unsuccessful, due in no small part to his being starved of supplies and reinforcements by a jealous Justinian. In 548, Justinian relieved him in favor of the eunuch [[Narses]], who, thanks both to military competence and cooperation from the Emperor was able to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion. For his part, Belisarius went into retirement.

In 537, in an incident that troubled him for the rest of his life, Belisarius, an Orthodox Christian, was commanded by the [[monophysite]] Empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]] to depose the reigning Pope, who had been installed by the Goths. This Pope was the former subdeacon [[Pope Silverius|Silverius]], the son of [[Pope Hormisdas]], against whom charges of treason were trumped up and pressed by Antonina, Belisarius' wife and Theodora's best friend. Belisarius was to replace him with the Deacon [[Pope Vigilius|Vigilius]], Apocrisarius of Pope John II in Constantinople. Vigilius had been chosen in 531 by Pope Boniface II to be his successor, but this choice was overwhelmingly rejected by the Roman clergy and faithful. Silverius was deposed and exiled to Patara in Lycia in Asia Minor but recalled at the command of the Emperor Justinian, following the complaints of the bishop of Patara. However, Vigilius had already been installed in his place and he and Antonina seem to have encompassed his death by starvation on the island of Palmaria (Ponza), whose patron saint he remains today. At the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Second Ecumenical Council of Constantinople]] (553), Belisarius was one of the Emperor's envoys to Pope Vigilius in their tug of war over [[Three-Chapter Controversy|"The Three Chapters"]]. The Patriarch Eutychius, who presided over this council in place of Pope Vigilius, was the son of one of Belisarius' generals. Belisarius, for his part, built a small oratory on the site of the present church of Santa Maria in Trivio in Rome as a sign of his repentance. He also built two hospices for pilgrims and a monastery, which have since disappeared. Santa Maria in Trivio is around the corner from the Trevi fountain; a 12th century inscription is the only surviving monument of the great general.

===Later life and campaigns===
The retirement of Belisarius came to an end in 559, when an army of [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgars]] under [[Zabergan]] crossed the [[Danube River]] to invade Byzantine territory for the first time and threatened Constantinople itself. Justinian recalled Belisarius to command the Byzantine army. In his last campaign, Belisarius defeated the Bulgars and drove them back across the river with a grossly outnumbered force at his command.

In 562, Belisarius stood trial in Constantinople on a charge of corruption. The charge was likely trumped-up, and modern research suggests that his former secretary [[Procopius]] of Caesarea, may have judged his case.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Belisarius was found guilty and imprisoned. However, not long after, Justinian pardoned him, ordered his release, and restored him to favour at the imperial court.

In the first five chapters of his ''[[Secret History]]'', Procopius characterises Belisarius as a cuckold husband, who was emotionally dependent on his debauched wife, Antonina. According to the historian, Antonina cheated on Belisarius with their godson, the young Theodosius. Procopius claims that the love affair was well known in the imperial court and the general was regarded as weak and ridiculous; this view is often considered as biased as Procopius nursed a longstanding hatred of both Belisarius and Antonina. Empress Theodora reportedly helped and saved Antonina when Belisarius tried to charge his wife at last.

Fittingly, Belisarius and Justinian, whose sometimes strained partnership increased the size of the empire by 45%, died within a few weeks of one another in November of 565. Belisarius owned the estate of Rufinianae on the Asiatic side of the Constantinople suburbs. He may very well have died there and been buried near one of the two churches in the area, probably Saints Peter and Paul.

==Legend as a blind beggar==
[[Image:Belisarius by Francois-Andre Vincent.jpg|thumb|left|''B<U+00E9>lisaire'', by [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Andr<U+00E9> Vincent]], 1776. Belisarius, blinded, a beggar, is recognised by one of his former soldiers]]
According to a story that gained popularity during the [[Middle Ages]], Justinian is said to have ordered Belisarius' eyes to be put out, and reduced him to the status of homeless beggar near the [[Porta Pinciana|Pincian Gate]] of Rome, condemned to asking passers-by to "give an [[obolus]] to Belisarius" (''date obolum Belisario''), before pardoning him. Most modern scholars believe the story to be apocryphal, though [[Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl Stanhope|Philip Stanhope]], a 19th century British [[philologist]] who wrote ''Life of Belisarius''&nbsp;<U+2014> the only exhaustive biography of the great general&nbsp;<U+2014> believed the story to be true. Based on a thorough parsing of the available primary sources, Stanhope created a noteworthy argument for the legend's authenticity.
[[Image:David - Belisarius.jpg|thumb|[[Belisarius Begging for Alms]], as depicted in popular legend, in the painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1781)]]
[[Image:Belisarius by Peyron.jpg|thumb|The outcast Belisarius receiving hospitality from a Peasant by [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Pierre Peyron]]]]
Though the legend remains of dubious provenance, after the publication of [[Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Marmontel]]'s novel ''[[B<U+00E9>lisaire (novel)|B<U+00E9>lisaire]]'' ([[1767 in literature|1767]]), this account became a popular subject for progressive painters and their patrons in the later 18th century, who saw parallels between the actions of Justinian and the repression imposed by contemporary rulers. For such subtexts, Marmontel's novel received a public censure by [[Louis Legrand]] of the Sorbonne, which contemporary divines regarded as model expositions of theological knowledge and clear thinking (''Catholic Encyclopedia'': "Louis Legrand"). Marmontel and the painters and sculptors (a bust of Belisarius by the French sculptor [[Jean-Baptiste Stouf]] is at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]]) depicted Belisarius as a kind of [[secular saint]], sharing the suffering of the downtrodden poor. The most famous of these paintings, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], combines the themes of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] (the [[alms]] giver), [[injustice]] (Belisarius), and the radical reversal of power (the soldier who recognises his old commander). Others portray him being helped by the poor after his rejection by the powerful.

==In fiction==

Belisarius was featured in several works of art before the 20th century. The oldest of them is the historical treatise by his very own secretary, [[Procopius]].  The ''Anecdota'', commonly referred to as the ''Arcana Historia'' or ''Secret History'', is an extended attack on Belisarius and Antonina, and on Justinian and Theodora, indicting Belisarius as a love-blind fool and his wife as unfaithful and duplicitous. Later works include:
* ''Belasarius'', 1607 play by [[Jakob Bidermann]].
* ''The life and history of Belisarius, who conquer'd Africa and Italy, with an account of his disgrace, the ingratitude of the Romans, and a parallel between him and a modern hero'', 1713 drama by [[John Oldmixon]].

* ''[[Belisario]]'', 19th century [[opera]], by [[Gaetano Donizetti]].
*''[[Count Belisarius]]'', [[1938 in literature|1938]] novel by [[Robert Graves]]. Ostensibly written from the viewpoint of the eunuch Eugenius, servant to Belisarius' wife (but actually based on [[Procopius]]'s history), the book portrays Belisarius as a solitary honorable man in a corrupt world, and paints a vivid picture of not only his startling military feats but also the colorful characters and events of his day, such as the savage [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] politics of the Constantinople chariot races, which regularly escalated to open street battles between fans of opposing factions, and the intrigue between the emperor Justinian and the empress Theodora.
*''[[Lest Darkness Fall]]'', [[1939 in literature|1939]] [[alternate history]] novel by [[L. Sprague de Camp]]. Belisarius appears first as the Byzantine opponent of the [[time travel]]er [[Martin Padway]] who tries to spread modern [[science]] and inventions in Gothic Italy. Eventually Belisarius becomes a general in Padway's army and secures Italy for him.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]] mentioned the legend of Belisario as a blind beggar in some of his poetic works, for example,"A quien ya no es joven," the first verse of which reads: "Ya puedes ver el tragico escenario y cada cosa en lugar debido; la espada y la ceniza para Dido y la moneda para Belisario."<ref>El Otro, El Mismo (1964) in Jorge Luis Borges, Obra Po<U+00E9>tica p.218 </ref>

*''[[The General series]]'' of [[military science fiction]] novels by [[S.M. Stirling]] and [[David Drake]].  The plot draws much from the life and campaigns of Belisarius; the main character, [[Raj Whitehall]], sets out to reunite the planet of Bellevue after the fall of galactic civilization.
*''A Flame in Byzantium'', 1987 historical horror fiction novel by [[Chelsea Quinn Yarbro]]
*''[[Destiny: A Chronicle of Deaths Foretold]]'', 1997 comic book miniseries authored by [[Alisa Kwitney]] with art by [[Kent Williams]], [[Michael Zulli]], [[Scott Hampton]], and [[Rebecca Guay]].  Belisarius briefly appears as a jealous husband, imprisoning his wife in their quarters due to rumors of her affairs, instead of fighting in Italy.
* The [[Belisarius series]] of six [[science fiction]] novels by [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Drake]].  [[alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]] exploring what might have happened if Belisarius and a rival were granted knowledge of future events and technologies.
