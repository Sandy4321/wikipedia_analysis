The '''Kingdom of East Anglia''', also known as the '''Kingdom of the East Angles''' ({{lang-ang|<U+0112>ast Engla r<U+012B>ce}}, {{lang-lat|provincia Orientalium Anglorum}}), was a small independent [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom that comprised what are now the [[England|English]] counties of [[Norfolk]] and [[Suffolk]] and perhaps the eastern part of the [[Fens]]. The kingdom formed after it was settled by a pagan [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking people]] known as the [[Angles]], who arrived after the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]] during the fifth century. East Anglia was bounded to the north and east by the [[North Sea]], and to the west by the Fens, but the precise boundaries between the kingdom and its southern and western neighbours, [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]] and [[Middle Anglia]], have not been defined.

Until 749 the [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|kings of East Anglia]] were members of the [[Wuffingas]] dynasty, named after the semi-historical [[Wuffa of East Anglia|Wuffa]]. During the early seventh century, under [[R<U+00E6>dwald of East Anglia|R<U+00E6>dwald]], East Anglia emerged to become a powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom. R<U+00E6>dwald, the first of the East Anglian kings to be baptised as a Christian, is considered by many experts to be the person who was buried within (or commemorated by) the ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], near Woodbridge. During the decades that followed his death in around 624, East Anglia became increasingly dominated by the powerful kingdom of [[Mercia]].  Several of R<U+00E6>dwald's successors were killed in battle, such as [[Sigeberht of East Anglia|Sigeberht]] (killed ''[[circa]]'' 641). Under Sigeberht's rule and the guidance of his bishop, [[Felix of Burgundy]], Christianity was firmly established in East Anglia.

After [[<U+00C6>thelberht II of East Anglia|<U+00C6>thelberht]] was killed by the Mercians in 794, and until 825, East Anglia ceased to be an independent kingdom, although it briefly reasserted its independence under [[Eadwald of East Anglia|Eadwald]] in 796. It survived until 869, when the [[Vikings]] defeated the East Anglians in battle and their king, [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund of East Anglia]], was killed. After 879, the Vikings settled permanently in East Anglia.  In 903 the exiled [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Wessex]] induced the East Anglian Danes to wage a disastrous war on his cousin [[Edward the Elder]]. By 917, after a succession of Danish defeats, East Anglia had submitted to Edward and was incorporated into the [[kingdom of England]], afterwards becoming an [[earl]]dom.

==Geography==

[[File:British Isles Physical map East.jpg|thumb|A physical map of Eastern England]]
The kingdom of the East Angles bordered the North Sea to the north and the east, with the river [[River Stour, Suffolk|Stour]] historically dividing it from the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxons]] to the south. The North Sea provided a "thriving maritime link to Scandinavia and the northern reaches of Germany", according to the historian Richard Hoggett. The kingdom's western boundary varied from the rivers [[River Great Ouse|Ouse]], [[River Lark|Lark]] and Kennett to further westwards, as far as the [[River Cam|Cam]] in what is now [[Cambridgeshire]]. At its greatest extent, the kingdom comprised the modern-day counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and parts of eastern Cambridgeshire.<ref>Hoggett, The Archaeology of the East Anglian Conversion'', pp. 1-2.</ref>

[[Erosion]] along the eastern border and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] along the north coast altered the shape of the East Anglian coastline during [[Roman Britain|Roman]] and Anglo-Saxon times (and continues to do so today). During Saxon times the sea inundated the naturally low-lying Fens. As sea levels fell [[alluvium]] was deposited near major river estuaries and the 'Great Estuary' near [[Burgh Castle]] became slowed closed off by a large [[Spit (landform)|spit]]. <ref>Hoggett, ''The Archaeology of the East Anglian Conversion'', p. 2.</ref>

==Sources==

No East Anglian [[charters]] (and few other documents) have survived to modern times and the mediaeval [[chronicle]]s that refer to the East Angles are treated with great caution by scholars. Very few records from the Kingdom of the East Angles have survived, because of the complete destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian [[Episcopal see|sees]] as the result of Viking raids and settlement.<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 58.</ref> The principal documentary source for the early period of the kingdom's history is ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiatical History of the English People]]'', written by [[Bede]] in the eighth century. East Anglia is first mentioned as a distinct political unit in the [[Tribal Hidage]], which is thought to have been compiled somewhere in England during the seventh century.<ref>Carver, ''The Age of Sutton Hoo'', p. 3.</ref>

* ''Ecclesiatical History of the English People''
* ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''
* The Tribal Hidage, where the East Angles are assessed at 30,000 [[Hide (unit)|hides]], evidently superior in resources to lesser kingdoms such as [[Kingdom of Sussex|Sussex]] and [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]].<ref>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 11.</ref>

==History==

===Settlement===

East Anglia was settled by the Anglo-Saxons as early as around 450, earlier than many other regions. It emerged from the settlement and political consolidation of Angles in the approximate area of the former territory of the [[Iceni]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ''civitas'' with its centre at ''[[Venta Icenorum]]'', close to [[Caistor St Edmund]].<ref name=Blackwell_154>Higham, '' 'East Anglia, Kingdom of' '', in ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 154.</ref> According to Bede, the East Angles (as well as the Middle Angles, the Mercians and the [[Northumbria]]ns) were descended from natives of [[Angeln]] (now in modern [[Denmark]]).<ref>Warner, ''Suffolk'', p. 61.</ref> The first reference to the East Angles is from around 704-713, in the Whitby ''Life of St Gregory''.<ref>Kirby, p. 20.</ref>

The East Angles formed one of the seven kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the [[Heptarchy]], a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century. Some modern historians have questioned whether seven independent kingdoms ever really existed contemporaneously, and claim that the political situation was much more complicated.<ref>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p. 4.</ref>

===Pagan rule===

[[File:Belt buckle.jpg|thumb|The golden belt buckle from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial]]
The East Angles were initially ruled by the pagan Wuffingas dynasty, apparently named after an early king, Wuffa, although his name could have been an invention to explain the dynastic name, which means 'descendants of the wolf'.<ref name=Blackwell_154 /> An indispensable main source of information on the early history of the kingdom and its rulers is Bede's ''Ecclesiatical History'',{{#tag:ref|See Hoggett, ''The Archaeology of the East Anglian Conversion'', pp. 24-27, for a detailed discussion of Bede's original sources and an account of the events in East Anglia that he refers to in the ''Ecclesiastical History''.<ref>Hoggett, ''East Anglian Conversion'', pp. 24-27.</ref>|group=note}} but he provided few facts relating to the chronology of the East Anglian kings or the length of their reigns.<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 58.</ref> Nothing is known of the earliest kings of East Anglia, or how the kingdom was organised, although an possible indication of the original centre of royal power is the concentration of ship-burials at [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]] and Sutton Hoo in eastern Suffolk. The 'North Folk' and 'South Folk' may have existed before the arrival of the first East Anglian kings.<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 61.</ref>

The most powerful of the Wuffingas kings was R<U+00E6>dwald, 'the son of Tytil, whose father was Wuffa',<ref name=Blackwell_154 /> according to the ''Ecclesiastical History''. For a brief period in the early seventh century, whilst R<U+00E6>dwald ruled, East Anglia was among the most powerful kingdoms in Anglo-Saxon England: R<U+00E6>dwald was described by Bede as the overlord of the kingdoms south of the [[River Humber]].<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 54.</ref> In 616, he had been strong enough to defeat and kill the Northumbrian king [[<U+00C6>thelfrith of Northumbria|<U+00C6>thelfrith]] at the Battle of the River Idle and install [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] as king of Northumbria.<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 52.</ref> He was probably the individual honoured by the sumptuous [[ship burial]] at Sutton Hoo.<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 55.</ref> It has been suggested by Blair, on the strength of the parallels between some of the objects found under Mound 1 at Sutton Hoo and those discovered at [[Vendel]] in [[Sweden]], that the Wuffingas may have been the descendants of an eastern Swedish royal family. However as those items previously thought to have come from Sweden are now believed to have been made in England, it seems less likely that the Wuffingas were of Swedish origin.<ref>Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms'', p. 61.</ref>

[[Image:Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy.jpg|250px|thumb|The [[Heptarchy]], according to Bartholomew's ''A literary & historical atlas of Europe'' (1914)]]

===Establishment of Christianity===

During the seventh century, [[Christian|Christianity]] became successfully established in East Anglia and replaced the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan beliefs]] of the Wuffingas dynasty and the East Anglian population. The extent to which the kingdom's paganism vanished is exemplified by a lack of any East Anglian settlements that are named after the old heathen gods.<ref>Hoops, ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, Volume 24'', p. 68.</ref>

R<U+00E6>dwald was the first king to be receptive to the overtures of Christian missionaries and was baptised and maintained a Christian altar, but at the same time continued to worship [[Anglo-Saxon deities|pagan gods]].<ref name="Yorke-62"/> On his death in around 624, he was succeeded by his son [[Eorpwald of East Anglia|Eorpwald]], who was soon afterwards converted from paganism as a result of the influence of Edwin,<ref name=Blackwell_154 /> but his new religion was evidently opposed in East Anglia and Eorpwald met his death at the hands of a pagan, [[Ricberht of East Anglia|Ricberht]]. After three years of [[apostasy]], Christianity prevailed with the accession of Eorpwald's brother (or step-brother) Sigeberht, who had been baptised during his exile in [[Francia]].<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 66.</ref> Sigeberht oversaw the establishment of the first East Anglian see for Felix of Burgundy at Dommoc, probably at [[Dunwich]].<ref>Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 109.</ref> He later abdicated in favour of his brother [[Ecgric of East Anglia|Ecgric]] and retired to a monastery.<ref>Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 84.</ref>

===Mercian aggression===

The eminence achieved by East Anglia under R<U+00E6>dwald did not last long, as his dynasty fell victim to the rising power of [[Penda of Mercia]] and his successors. Throughout the mid-seventh to early ninth centuries, Mercian power grew until a vast region from the [[Thames]] to the Humber, including East Anglia and the south-east, became a zone of Mercian hegemony.<ref>Brown and Farr, ''Mercia'', pp. 2, 4.</ref> In the early 640s Penda defeated and killed both Ecgric and Sigeberht,<ref name="Yorke-62">Yorke, ''Kings and Kingdoms of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 62.</ref> who was later venerated as a saint.<ref>Baring-Gould, ''The Lives of the Saints'', vol. 12, p. 712.</ref> Ecgric's successor [[Anna of East Anglia|Anna]] and Anna's son Jurmin were killed together in 654 at the Battle of Bulcamp, near [[Blythburgh]].<ref>Warner, ''The Origins of Suffolk'', p. 142.</ref> Having eliminated Anna's challenge to his rising power, Penda then subjected the East Anglians to Mercian overlord-ship.<ref>Yorke, 'Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 63.</ref> In 655 [[<U+00C6>thelhere of East Anglia]] joined Penda in a campaign against [[Oswiu of Northumbria]], which ended in a disastrous Mercian defeat at the [[Battle of the Winwaed]], in which both Penda and his ally <U+00C6>thelhere were killed.<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', pp. 78-79.</ref>

The last Wuffingas king was [[<U+00C6>lfwald of East Anglia|<U+00C6>lfwald]], who died in 749.<ref>Hoops, ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, Volume 6'', p. 328.</ref> During the late 7th and 8th centuries East Anglia continued to be overshadowed by Mercian hegemony until, in 794, [[Offa of Mercia]] had the East Anglian king <U+00C6>thelberht executed and then took control of the kingdom for himself.<ref>Brown and Farr, ''Mercia'', p. 215. </ref> A brief revival of East Anglian independence under [[Eadwald of East Anglia|Eadwald]] after Offa's death in 796 was soon suppressed by the new Mercian king, [[Coenwulf of Mercia|Coenwulf]].<ref>Brown and Farr, ''Mercia'', p. 310.</ref>

The independence of the East Anglians was restored by a successful rebellion against Mercia led by [[<U+00C6>thelstan of East Anglia|<U+00C6>thelstan]] in 825. [[Beornwulf of Mercia]]'s attempt to restore Mercian control over East Anglia resulted in his defeat and death, and his successor [[Ludeca of Mercia|Ludeca]] met the same end in 827. The East Angles appealed to [[Egbert of Wessex]] for protection against the Mercians and <U+00C6>thelstan then acknowledged Egbert as his overlord. Whilst Wessex took control of the south-eastern kingdoms which had been absorbed by Mercia during the eighth century, East Anglia could maintain its independence.<ref>Brown and Farr, ''Mercia: an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in Europe'', pp. 222, 313.</ref>

===Viking attacks and eventual settlement===

[[File:England 878.jpg|250px|thumb|right|England in 878, when East Anglia was ruled by [[Guthrum]]]]
In 865, East Anglia was invaded by the Danish '[[Great Heathen Army]]', which occupied winter quarters and secured horses before departing for Northumbria.<ref>Kirby, ''The Earliest English Kings'', p. 173.</ref> The Danes returned to East Anglia in 869, wintering at [[Thetford]] before being attacked by the forces of Edmund of East Anglia, who was defeated and killed at H<U+00E6>gelisdun (recently identified with Bradfield St Clare, which is nearby to his final resting place at [[Bury St. Edmunds]]).<ref name=Blackwell_154 /><ref>Hoops, ''Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, Volume 6'', p. 328.</ref> From this point onwards, East Anglia effectively ceased to be an independent kingdom. Having defeated the East Angles, the Danes then installed puppet-kings to govern on their behalf, while they resumed their campaigns against Mercia and Wessex.<ref>Forte et al, ''Viking Empires'', p. 72.</ref>  In 878 the last portion of the Great Heathen Army to remain active was defeated by [[Alfred the Great]] and withdrew from Wessex after making a peace treaty. In 880 the Vikings returned to East Anglia under the leadership of [[Guthrum the Old|Guthrum]], who, according to the mediaeval historian [[Pauline Stafford]], "swiftly adapted to territorial kingship and its trappings, including the minting of coins".<ref>Stafford, in ''A Companion to the early Middle Ages'', p. 205.</ref>

In addition to the traditional territory of East Anglia, Cambridgeshire and parts of [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Hertfordshire]], Guthrum's kingdom probably included Essex, the only portion of Wessex which had come under Danish control.<ref>Hunter Blair and Keynes, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 79.</ref> A peace treaty made between Alfred and Guthrum sometime in the 880s.<ref>Lavelle, ''Alfred's wars: sources and interpretations of Anglo-Saxon warfare in the Viking Age'', p. 325.</ref>

===Absorption into the kingdom of England===

In the early tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came under increasing pressure from [[Edward the Elder]], king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Wessex|<U+00C6>thelwold]], who had been driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne, arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by some or all of the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of <U+00C6>thelwold and of [[Eohric of East Anglia]] in a battle in the Fens.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 321-2.</ref>

Between 911 and 919, Edward expanded his control over the rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia [[burh]]s, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes.<ref>Wilson, ''The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 135-6.</ref> In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at [[Tempsford]]. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, and following the defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 328.</ref>

The territory of East Anglia was absorbed into the kingdom of England. Norfolk and Suffolk became part of the new [[Earl of East Anglia|earldom of East Anglia]], when in 1017, [[Thorkell the Tall]] was made earl of East Anglia by [[Cnut]].<ref>Harper-Bill and Van Houts, ''A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'', p. 7.</ref> The restoration of the ecclesiastical structure in the region saw the two former East Anglian bishoprics replaced by a single one based at [[North Elmham]].<ref name=Blackwell_154 />

==The Old East Anglian dialect==

The East Angles spoke Old English. Their language is historically important, as they were among the first Germanic settlers to arrive in Britain during the fifth century: according to Kortmann and Schneider, East Anglia "can seriously claim to be the first place in the world where English was spoken".<ref>Kortmann and Schneider, ''Varieties of English'', p. 163.</ref>

The evidence for [[Dialect|dialects]] in Old English comes from the study of texts, place-names, personal names and coins.<ref>Fisiak, ''Old East Anglian'', p. 22.</ref> A. H. Smith was the first to recognise the existence of a separate Old East Anglian dialect, in addition to the previously recognised dialects of Northumbrian, Mercian, Saxon and Kentish. He acknowledged that his proposal of such a dialect was tentative, acknowledging that "the linguistic boundaries of the original dialects could not have have enjoyed prolonged stability".<ref>Fisiak, ''Old East Anglian'', pp. 19-20.</ref> As no East Anglian manuscripts, Old English inscriptions or literary records such as charters have survived to modern times, there is little evidence to support the existence of an Old East Anglian dialect. According to a study made by Von Feilitzen in the 1930s, the recording of many place-names in ''[[Domesday Book]]'' was "ultimately based on the evidence of local juries" and so the spoken form of Anglo-Saxon places and people was partly preserved in this way.<ref>Fisiak, ''Old East Anglian'', pp. 22-23.</ref> Evidence from ''Domesday Book'' and later sources does suggest that a dialect boundary once existed, corresponding with a line that separates from their neighbours the English counties of Cambridgeshire (including the once sparsely inhabited Fens), Norfolk and Suffolk.<ref>Fisiak, ''Old East Anglian'', p. 27.</ref>
