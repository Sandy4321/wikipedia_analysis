'''Jean-Victor Poncelet''' ([[July 1]], [[1788]] &ndash; [[December 22]], [[1867]]) was a [[French people|French]] [[engineer]] and [[mathematician]]. He is considered a reviver of [[projective geometry]], and his work ''Trait<U+00E9> des propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s projectives des figures'' is considered the first definitive paper on the subject since [[G<U+00E9>rard Desargues]]' work on it in the [[17th century]]. He later wrote an introduction to it; ''Applications d<U+2019>analyse et de g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trie''.<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469548/Jean-Victor-Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=2008|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc}}</ref>

As a mathematician, his most notable work was in [[projective geometry]], in particular, his work on [[Feuerbach's theorem]]. He also made discoveries about [[projective harmonic conjugates]]; among these were the poles and polar lines associated with [[conic section]]s. These discoveries led to the [[duality (projective geometry)|principle of duality]], and also aided in the development of [[complex numbers]] and [[projective geometry]].<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469548/Jean-Victor-Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=2008|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc}}</ref>

As an military engineer, he served in [[Napoleon]]'s campaign against the [[Russian Empire]] in 1812, in which he was captured and held prisoner until 1814. Later, he served as a domestic civil engineer in his home town of [[Metz]]. At this position, he developed improved the design of [[turbine]]s and [[water wheel]]s. He then served as a [[professor]] of [[mechanics]] at the <U+00C9>cole d<U+2019>Application there, during which time he published ''Introduction a la m<U+00E9>canique industrielle'', a work he is famous for. After this, he served as professor at the Faculty of Sciences at the [[University of Paris]], and finally as the commandant of his ''alma mater'', the [[<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique]]. At this last post, he reached the rank of general.<ref name="britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469548/Jean-Victor-Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=2008|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years (1788&ndash;1814)===
Poncelet was born in [[Metz]], [[France]], on [[July 1]], [[1788]]; the son of Claude Poncelet, a member of the Parliament of Metz. At a young age, he was sent to live with the Olier family at [[Saint-Avold]].<ref name="didion">Didion 1870, p. 102</ref> He attended the [[<U+00C9>cole Polytechnique]], a prestigious French school located in [[Paris]], from 1808 to 1810. After 1810, he attended the Ecole d'Application in his home town of Metz to study [[engineering]]. After graduation, he became a [[military]] [[engineer]] and achieved the rank of [[lieutenant]] in the [[French army]].<ref name="mactutor">{{cite web|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Poncelet.html|accessdate=2008-04-19|author=John J O'Connor and Edmund F Robertson}}</ref>

Poncelet took part in [[Napoleon I of France|Napololeon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in 1812. He was abandoned for dead by his fellow soldiers at the [[Battle of Krasnoi]].<ref name="columbia">{{cite encyclopedia|publisher=Columbia University Press|encyclopedia=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|edition=6|year=2007|accessdate=2008-04-19}}</ref> The Russians took Poncelet as a [[prisoner of war]] and confined him at [[Saratov]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Poncelet.html|accessdate=2008-31-08|author=Eric W. Weisstein|year=1996|title=Poncelet, Jean-Victor}}</ref> During his imprisonment, in the years 1812&ndash;1814, he wrote his most notable work; ''Trait<U+00E9> des propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s projectives des figures''. This work outlined the foundations of projective geometry, as well as some new results. Poncelet, however, could not publish it until after his release in 1814.<ref name="brit1911">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=1911|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc|volume=22|page=59}}</ref>

===Middle years (1822&ndash;1848)===
In 1815, the year after his release, Poncelet was employed a military engineer at his hometown of Metz. In 1822, while at this position, he published ''Trait<U+00E9> des propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s projectives des figures''. This work was the first major to discuss projective geometry since Desargues', though [[Gaspard Monge]] had written a few minor works about it previously. It is considered the founding work of modern projective geometry.<ref name="mactutor">{{cite web|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Poncelet.html|accessdate=2008-04-19|author=John J O'Connor and Edmund F Robertson}}</ref> [[Joseph Diaz Gergonne]] wrote about this branch of geometry at approximately the same time, beginning in 1810. Poncelet published several papers about the subject in Gergonne's mathematical [[journal]] ''Annales de Gergonne'' (officially known as ''Annales de math<U+00E9>matiques pures et appliqu<U+00E9>es'').<ref name="brit1911">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica|title=Jean-Victor Poncelet|accessdate=2008-04-19|year=1911|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica, Inc|volume=22|page=59}}</ref> 

In 1825, he became the professor of [[mechanics]] at the <U+00C9>cole d'Application in Metz, a position he held until 1835. During his tenure at this school, he improved the design of [[turbine]]s and [[waterwheel]]s, deriving his work from the mechanics of the [[Provence|Proven<U+00E7>al]] mill from southern France.<ref>{{cite web|author=James B.

===Later years (1848&ndash;1867)===
In 1848, Lemoine became commandant of his ''alma mater''; the <U+00C9>cole Polytechnique, having a rank of general.<ref>Didion 1870, pg. 101</ref> During this time, he wrote ''Applications d'analyse et de g<U+00E9>om<U+00E9>trie'', which served as an introduction to his earlier work ''Trait<U+00E9> des propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s projectives des figures''. It was published in two volumes in 1862 and 1864.<ref>Bertrand 1879, pg. 45</ref>
