The '''Liberal Democrats''', often shortened to '''Lib Dems''' or just '''Liberals''', are a [[centre-left]]<ref name="economist.com">http://www.economist.com/daily/news/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10927596</ref><ref name="leftright">{{cite web|year = 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1562339.stm|title=Quiet battle rages for Lib Dem soul|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-24}}</ref> [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]], formed in 1988 by a merger of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]; the two parties had been [[SDP-Liberal Alliance|in alliance]] for seven years, from shortly after the formation of the SDP. The party's leader is [[Nick Clegg]].

The Lib Dems are the third-largest party in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], behind [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. There are 63 Lib Dem [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) <U+2013> 62 were elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], and one in the [[Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006]]. The [[Scottish Liberal Democrats]] formed a coalition [[Scottish Executive]] with Labour in the first two sessions of the [[Scottish Parliament]], and the Welsh party were in a [[Lib-Lab Pact|coalition]] with Labour in the [[National Assembly for Wales]] from 2001 to 2003.

Promoting [[social liberalism]], Lib Dems seek to minimise state intervention in personal affairs: they oppose what they call the '[[nanny state]]'.  Their president's [[book of office]] is [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'', which defined the [[harm principle]] of law.  While objecting to state limitations of individual rights, they favour a welfare state that provides for the necessities and amenities of life.<ref name="Barr">Barr, N. (2004). ''Economics of the welfare state''. Oxford University Press.</ref><ref name="Starr">Starr, P. (2007). ''Freedom's power: The true force of liberalism''. New York: Basic Books.</ref>

They support [[multilateral]] foreign policy; they opposed British participation in the [[War in Iraq]] and supported the withdrawal of troops from the country, and are the most pro-[[European Union]] of the three main parties in the UK. The party has strong [[environmentalist]] values <U+2013> favouring [[renewable energy]] and commitments to deeper cuts in [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. Since their foundation, Lib Dems have advocated [[electoral reform]] to use [[proportional representation]], replacing the [[House of Lords]] with an elected chamber, and cutting government departments.

==Ideology==
The Liberal Democrats describe their ideology as giving "power to the people"; they are against the concentration of power in unaccountable bodies. They propose decentralisation of power out of [[Houses of Parliament|Westminster]], and electoral and parliamentary reform, to create a system of tiered government structures to make decisions at what they see as the right level, including regional assemblies, the European Union, and international organisations. Lib Dems want to protect [[civil liberties]], and oppose state intervention in personal affairs.

===Position===
The Lib Dems are a centre-left/centrist party<ref name="economist.com"/>, like both of its predecessor parties, the [[Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party]], favouring the welfare state and progressive taxation. Former leader [[Charles Kennedy]] said that they were neither to the left nor the right.<ref name="leftright"/> His successor [[Menzies Campbell]] later stated, however, that his party is of the [[centre-left]].<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/sep/20/uk.libdem2007</ref> Using a two-dimensional scale, [[Political Compass]] defined the Lib Dems as social [[libertarian]]s and [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]], with both positions close to the centre, while [[History of the British Labour Party#New Labour|New Labour]] and the Conservatives were defined as more economically liberal and also socially [[authoritarian]].<ref name="politicalcompass">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://politicalcompass.org/extremeright|title =UK Election 2005 <U+2013> a different way of seeing it|publisher =[[Political Compass]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref>

The centrist shift of Labour accelerated after the election of Tony Blair; New Labour increased support by courting centrist Conservative voters. Thus the Lib Dems tried to accommodate the Labour left with [[social liberal]] policies. This was partly successful: for example, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Tariq Ali]], implored Londoners to vote for the party in the 2005 general election, over the Iraq war.<ref name="tariqali">{{cite web|year = 2005|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/mar/26/liberaldemocrats.election2005|title =For one day only, I'm a Lib Dem|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref> At the 2005 conference, there was a discussion on whether social liberal policies had attracted as much support as possible, and whether the party should move to the right to attract Conservative voters.<ref name="centrelefttelegraph">{{cite web|year =2006|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1512200/Campbell%27s-green-light-for-tax-on-cheap-flights.html|title =Campbell's green light for tax on cheap flights|publisher =[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> [[Menzies Campbell]] dropped proposals such as a 50% tax rate for those who earn over <U+00A3>100,000 as part of a tax policy review;<ref name="centrelefttelegraph" /> such policies  portrayed the party as left-wing, which risked losing the support of wealthier floating voters. However, in September 2008 the party conference passed a motion to cut 4p from the basic rate of income tax, which some{{Who|date=May 2009}} have alleged is an attempt to win favour with voters who are swinging to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

====Human rights and law====
The Liberal Democrats' constitution speaks of: <blockquote>..."a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity. We champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals, we acknowledge and respect their right to freedom of conscience and their right to develop their talents to the full. We aim to disperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity. We believe that the role of the state is to enable all citizens to attain these ideals, to contribute fully to their communities and to take part in the decisions which affect their lives."<ref name="constitution">{{cite web

|accessdate =2008-07-29}}</ref></blockquote>

The party's presidential [[book of office]], ''[[On Liberty]]'', defines the [[harm principle]]: <blockquote>"That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."<ref name="On Liberty">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/130/1.html |author=John Stuart Mill|title=On Liberty|publisher=Longman, Roberts & Green|published=1869|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref></blockquote>

When [[Nick Clegg]] was Home Affairs spokesperson, he proposed a ''Freedom Bill'' to repeal what he described as "illiberal or irrelevant legislation"; part of the 3000 criminal offences that the Labour government had created, which took up more pages than "two hundred copies of ''[[War and Peace]]''".<ref name="freedombill">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://www.egovmonitor.com/node/8746|title =Why we need a Freedom Bill|publisher =Policy Dialogue International|accessdate =2008-03-27}}</ref> Legislation that he wanted to repeal included: restrictions on protests in [[Parliament Square]], [[DNA database|DNA retention]] of those found innocent, and extradition to the [[United States]] without evidence.<ref name="freedombill" />

Lib Dems want the United Kingdom to have a [[written constitution]] to "enshrine the rights of the British people and the responsibilities of Government", and a [[Bill of Rights]] to "provide a final guarantee of civil liberties".<ref name="civilliberties">{{cite web|year = 2005|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/assets/0000/8215/6_Policy_Briefing_Civil_Liberties.pdf|format=PDF|title =Protecting Civil Liberties|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-03-16}}</ref> They are in favour of laws against all forms of discrimination based on race, gender, disability, religion, and sexuality in an 'Equality Act':<ref name="civilliberties" /><ref>{{cite web

They first proposed [[civil partnerships]] in the UK, and want to end all differences in law and pensions between same- and mixed-sex marriages and they would make incitement of [[homophobic]] hatred an offence.

They oppose the more [[authoritarian]] of Labour's [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001|anti-terror laws]], including 'detention without trial'.<ref name="civilliberties" /> They strongly oppose the [[British national identity card]], supporting the [[NO2ID]] campaign,<ref name="NO2ID">{{cite web|year = 20078|url =http://www.no2id.net/about/supporters.php|title =Our Supporters|publisher =[[NO2ID]]|accessdate =2008-04-06}}</ref> and would only allow the use of [[biometric]]s in [[passport]]s, on the condition that the database behind these passports would carry only the information on the passport and the biometric match.<ref name="Sep8">{{cite web|year = 2005|title=ID cards|publisher=Lynne Featherstone|accessdate=2007-09-08|url=http://www.lynnefeatherstone.org/column101-identity-cards.htm}}</ref> They would use phone-taps and other '[[Lawful interception|intercept communications']] as evidence in court against terrorist suspects, making prosecution easier;<ref name="Sep8"/> and propose that judges should be able to give life sentences to those who should stay in prison forever, opposing mandatory life sentences for all serious crimes which may not mean life.<ref name="mandatorylifeterms">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/jan/23/liberaldemocrats.immigrationpolicy|title =Scrap mandatory life terms for serious crimes, say Lib Dems|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-16}}</ref> The party has been popular among campaigners for the decriminalisation of [[recreational drugs]];<ref name="legalisationpopular">{{cite web|year = 2001|url =http://www.idmu.co.uk/drugvote.htm|title =Analysis of political opinions among drug users (UK 1998<U+2013>2000)|publisher =Independent Drug Monitoring Unit|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref> Lib Dems want scientific reform of drug classification <U+2013> they think that it is "not in the public interest" to prosecute for possession or cultivation of [[cannabis]] for personal or medical use, but would introduce a new offence of 'dealing' for those who supply illegal drugs, especially in sensitive areas such as near schools or psychiatric facilities.<ref name="druglawreform">{{cite web|year = 2005|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/10DrugLawReform.pdf|format=PDF|title =Honesty, Realism, Responsibility: Drug Law Reform|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-04-27}}</ref>

====Spending and taxation====

'''Summary:''' ''The Lib Dems state they would lower taxes for poor and middle class people, and make up that government revenue deficit by taxing the rich more, closing tax loopholes exploited by corporations, and by making government spending more efficient and effective.''

Historically Lib Dems favoured raising [[progressive tax]]es to spend on public services, and 'small-state' policies such as the abolition of government departments. Under [[Nick Clegg]]'s leadership they advocate cuts in the tax burden, particularly for lower and average earners, funded by reallocation and savings in government spending, further green taxation and raising taxes for the top 10% of earners.<ref name="taxcuts" /><ref name="2008taxes" /><ref name="2007taxreform" /> Their policy for most of the 1990s was to increase the basic rate of income tax by one percent to fund increase public funding (especially in education).<ref name="1pincometax">{{cite web|year = 2002|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2002/apr/08/localgovernment.politics|title =Lib Dems declare war on council tax|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref> This proposal was abandoned after [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government increased [[national insurance]] contributions by the same amount, which had a similar effect.<ref name="1pincometax" /> Other previous policy included increasing the top rate of income tax by ten percentage points to 50% for those earning over <U+00A3>100,000 per year, but this was abandoned in 2006 after the party conference approved new tax policies which left the top rate at 40%.<ref name="centrelefttelegraph" />

Lib Dems support universal free education, and propose to abolish university [[top-up fees]] and set up a system of Government grants for students.<ref name="notuitionfees">{{cite web|year = 2005|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/media/documents/policies/04HigherandFurtherEducation.pdf|format=PDF|title =The key to life-long learning|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-03-16}}</ref> For schools, they want the government to guarantee equal access, basic standards and entitlements, but then to allow for variation and innovation;<ref name="schools1">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7456457.stm|title = Lib Dems would replace some tests|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-06-16}}</ref> they want to spend <U+00A3>2.5 billion to raise funding for the poorest 10% of pupils to the level of [[private school]]s, cut class sizes in primary schools, and to ensure all secondary schools are funded at specialist school levels.<ref name="schools2">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/05/nickclegg.schoolfunding|title =We must invest in schools|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-06-05}}</ref> They would abolish exams for seven and fourteen year-olds, ban ministers from sending "directives and diktats" to schools and have a "radically slimmed down" curriculum to allow for innovation and testing of different forms of teaching.<ref name="schools1" />

In 2002 the party said they would use all [[National Insurance]] contributions to fund a [[decentralised]] [[National Health Service]], and fund schools and local services from a 'local income tax', which would replace [[Council Tax]].<ref name="NIC/LIT">{{cite web|year = 2002|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2261422.stm|title =Lib Dems press for NHS tax|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-25}}</ref> In 2008 Clegg said that he would allow people to 'top up' their NHS healthcare to buy non taxpayer-funded drugs, on the condition that the drugs were clinically approved, that there are no hidden costs to the NHS, and that the NHS couldn't use top-ups to cut services.<ref name="NHStopup">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/09/liberaldemocrats.health|title =Patients should be allowed top-up healthcare, says Lib Dem leader|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-09-09}}</ref> The party also released a set of targets to cut poverty in the UK by 2020: to remove five million people from poverty, bring two million into employment, and build one million more [[affordable housing|affordable homes]].<ref name="poverty">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/freedom-from-poverty-opportunity-for-all-all;show|title =Freedom From Poverty, Opportunity For All|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-09-22}}</ref> The strategies that they propose to achieve these include a <U+00A3>1.5 billion 'Pupil Premium' to improve education for the poorest 1.5 million children, raising [[child benefit]] by up to <U+00A3>5 per week for each family, expanding [[sex education]] to cut [[teenage pregnancy]] and [[STDs]], and to reform [[tax credits]] to save <U+00A3>3 billion per year by reducing overpayments and concentrating payments on low-income families.<ref name="poverty" />

Lib Dems are against the closure of 2500 [[post office]]s on top of the 4000 closed in the [[Blair Ministry|Labour government]] and 3500 closed in the [[Major Ministry|last Conservative government]].<ref name="postoffices">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/campaigns/save-our-post-offices-439282;show|title =Save our Post Offices|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-05-09}}</ref> Their plan to keep post offices open includes allowing other mail delivery companies to run stores, and selling a 49% stake in [[Royal Mail]] to other companies to raise <U+00A3>2 billion to fund a wider range of services in each store.<ref name="postoffices" /> The party supported and predicted [[nationalisation]] of the [[Northern Rock]] bank from the start of its [[Northern Rock#2007 Credit Crisis|financial difficulty]].<ref name="nationalisation">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2007/dec/11/economy.uk|title =Nationalise Northern Rock, say Lib Dems|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-16}}</ref> In 2007 the party protested against [[Gordon Brown]]'s budget, which was condemned when introduced in 2008 as it funded a 2% cut in the 22% income tax rate by abolishing the 10% rate.<ref name="10%taxabolition">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6475445.stm|title =Lib Dems slam Budget tax changes|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-05-09}}</ref> Former leader [[Ming Campbell]] said the Brown had "asked the poor to subsidise the rich", and that "the prime minister made the case, the chancellor signed the cheque and the Conservatives voted it through."<ref name="10%taxabolition" />

In 2007 the Lib Dems published their policies for reforming the taxation system. Their proposals included making the system: greener, with incentives for less use of resources; more centralised, to link it to local services; simpler, with [[deregulation|less regulations]] and smaller tax returns; and fairer, with tax cuts for the poor and fewer loopholes exploited by the rich.<ref name="2007taxreform">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.libdems.org.uk/assets/0000/7890/Policy_Paper_81_-_Reducing_the_Burden.pdf|format=PDF|title =Reducing the Burden|publisher =Liberal Democrats|accessdate =2008-09-22}}</ref> They want to raise the [[inheritance tax]] threshold to <U+00A3>500,000, cut [[stamp duty]] on properties worth less than <U+00A3>500,000, and make non-UK residents eligible for [[capital gains tax]].<ref name="2007taxreform" /> The party's proposal to replace [[Council Tax]] with a local income tax was approved at the 2003 conference.<ref name="counciltax">{{cite web|year = 2003|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3130988.stm|title =Lib Dems vote to axe council tax|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-16}}</ref> [[Ed Davey]] said that Council Tax was "the least fair major tax", as it took 5.1% of the income from the poorest taxpayers, and 1.2% from the richest; their replacement '[[local income tax]]' would take 3% from higher tax brackets and less than 3% for poorer brackets.<ref name="counciltax" /> In 2008 [[Nick Clegg]] stated the party still advocated this, as part of devolving power to regional and local authorities, where they set their own tax levels.<ref name="2008taxes">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/7237551.stm|title = Nick Clegg interview transcript|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-02-18}}</ref> Clegg also launched [http://www.libdems.org.uk/assets/0000/7745/Make_it_Happen.pdf Make it Happen] saying that he wants to use <U+00A3>20 billion of savings in government spending (a 3% cut), to cut the tax burden for 80<U+2013>90% of taxpayers, particularly lower and average earners, including a cut in the lower rate of income tax to 16%.<ref name="taxcuts">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1054542/Lib-Dems-pledge-cut-taxes-slash-spending-ease-recession-pain.html|title =Lib Dems pledge to cut taxes and slash spending to ease recession pain|publisher =[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate =2008-09-11}}</ref>

Lib Dems consider [[war|military intervention]] to "always be a last resort", and only condone its use upon [[UN Security Council]] agreement, after options such as economic [[sanctions]], [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian assistance]] and [[diplomacy|diplomatic pressure]] fail to protect human rights.<ref name="internationalaffairs" /> Clegg advocates strict rules for military interventions: that they are based on a just cause and have the right intention, are sanctioned by a legitimate authority, are proportional, and "must have a reasonable chance of success".<ref name="militaryintervention">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7469471.stm|title =Clegg puts case for intervention|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-06-23}}</ref> He said that the UK should help develop the UN's [[Responsibility to protect]] doctrine, so it can intervene "when a state intentionally permits extreme and unnecessary suffering that it has the power to stop".<ref name="militaryintervention" /> With a few exceptions (including [[Paddy Ashdown]]),<ref name="iraqwarashdown">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531454/How-to-win-a-war-and-lose-the-peace.html|title = How to win a war and lose the peace|publisher =[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> Lib Dem MPs opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], but disagreed on whether troops should be withdrawn immediately or not once the war had begun.<ref name="iraqwardivision">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060224/ai_n16178054|title =Lib Dem leadership contenders at odds in final appeal for votes|publisher =[[The Independent]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> The party supported forces that had been ordered to fight until the initial military action was completed, when they renewed their political opposition.

He suggested barring the "gates of [[Westminster]]" and suggested "stopping MPs leaving for their summer holidays until this crisis has been sorted out".

==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|right|150px|Logo of the SDP-Liberal Alliance]]
The Liberal Democrats were formed on 2 March 1988 by merging the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. The Liberals descended from the [[British Whig Party]], the [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]] and the [[Peelites]], and the SDP were a Labour splinter group.<ref name="liberalhistory">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=4&item=history|title =A concise history of the Liberal Party, SDP and Liberal Democrats|publisher =Liberal Democrat History Group|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref>

Having declined to third party status after the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1918 and especially during the 1920s, the Liberals were challenged for their place in the centre in the 1980s. When the Labour Party adopted hard-line socialist policies, a group of moderate Labour MPs broke away and established the Social Democratic Party (SDP), aiming to preserve previous Labour traditions.<ref name="liberalhistory" /> The SDP and the Liberals realised that there was no place for two centrist political parties, and entered into the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] so that they would not stand against each other in elections. The Alliance was led by [[David Steel]] (Liberal) and [[Roy Jenkins]] (SDP); Jenkins was replaced by [[David Owen]].<ref name="liberalhistory" /> The two parties had their own policies and emphases, but produced a joint [[manifesto]] for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] general elections.

Following disappointing results in the 1987 election, Steel proposed to merge the two parties. Although opposed by Owen, it was supported by a majority of members of both parties, and they formally merged in 1988, with Steel and [[Robert Maclennan]] (who had become SDP leader in August 1987) as joint interim leaders. The new party was named '''Social and Liberal Democrats''' (SLD); after shortening this to '''The Democrats''' in October 1988, it changed to '''Liberal Democrats''' in October 1989, which is frequently shortened to '''Lib Dems'''.<ref name="liberalhistory" /> The minority of the SDP who rejected the merger remained under Owen's leadership in a rump SDP; The minority of the Liberal Party divided, with some retiring from politics immediately and some (led by former Liberal MP Michael Meadowcroft), creating a new '[[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party']] which, nevertheless claimed to be the continuation of the Liberal Party which had just dissolved itself. Michael Meadowcroft eventually joined the Liberal Democrats (they called it 'rejoined') in 2008 but some of his former followers continue still as 'The Liberal Party', most notably in a couple of electoral wards of the City of Liverpool.<ref name="liberalhistory" />

===Post-1988 history===
====Ashdown (1988<U+2013>1999)====
[[Image:PaddyAshdownCampaigning.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Paddy Ashdown]]: Leader from 1988 to 1999]]
The former Liberal MP Paddy Ashdown was elected leader in July 1988. The party had a difficult birth, struggling to assert an identity, especially after two name changes <U+2013> at the [[European Parliament election, 1989 (United Kingdom)|1989 European Elections]] they received only 6% of the vote, beaten into fourth place by the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]].<ref name="liberalhistory" /> By the early 1990s, the party recovered under Ashdown's leadership: they performed better at the 1990 local elections and in [[by-election]]s <U+2013> including at [[Eastbourne by-election, 1990|Eastbourne in 1990]] and [[Ribble Valley by-election, 1991|Ribble Valley]] and [[Kincardine and Deeside by-election, 1991|Kincardine & Deeside]] in 1991. This local popularity continued to grow throughout the decade.

The Lib Dems did not repeat the 20%+ shares of national votes in the 1990s which the Alliance had achieved in the 1980s: at their first [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|election in 1992]] they won 17.8% of the vote and twenty seats.<ref name="1990s">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/article.php?id=82|title =Statistics 1990s|publisher =[[Electoral Reform Society]]|accessdate =2008-04-13}}</ref> They more than doubled their representation at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], by gaining 46 seats<ref name="1990s" /> <U+2013> through [[tactical voting]] and concentrating resources in winnable seats.<ref name="rennard" />

Following the election of [[Tony Blair]] as Labour leader in 1994, Ashdown controversially pursued cooperation between the two parties <U+2013> to form a [[coalition government]].<ref name="ashdownpact">{{cite web|year =2009|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/522526.stm|title =Blair considered coalition after 1997|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> This [[Lib-Lab pact]] failed to form because Labour's massive majority after the 1997 general election made it an irrelevance for Labour, and because Labour were not prepared to consider the  introduction of [[proportional representation]] and other Lib Dem conditions.<ref name="ashdownpact" />

[[Image:Charles Kennedy, October 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Kennedy]]: Leader from 1999 to 2006]]
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], the Lib Dems gained their highest share of the vote since the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] (22.1%), receiving 62 seats.<ref name="2005election" /> Many had anticipated that this election would be the Lib Dem's breakthrough at Westminster; party activists hoped to better the 25.4% support of the 1983 election, or to reach 100 MPs.<ref name="better2005election">{{cite web|year = 2005|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/apr/26/liberaldemocrats.election2005|title =Kennedy can still exploit this perfect political storm|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref> 2005 could be considered a wasted opportunity for the party; but much of the apparent lack of success was a result of the Westminster [[first-past-the-post]] elections: the party got almost a quarter of the total votes nationally but only one-tenth of the seats in the Commons.<ref name="2005election" />

One trend at the election was that Lib Dems replaced the Conservatives as Labour's main opponents in urban areas. Many gains came in previously Labour-held urban constituencies (e.g. [[Manchester Withington (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Withington]], [[Cardiff Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardiff Central]], [[Birmingham Yardley (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Yardley]]), and they had over 100 second-place finishes behind Labour candidates.<ref name="2005election" /> The British electoral system makes it hard for the Conservatives to form a government without winning some city seats out of its rural heartlands, such as the Lib Dem [[Bristol West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol West]] constituency, where the Conservatives came third in 2005 after holding the seat until 1997.<ref name="keyconstituencies">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seats-to-watch|title =Seats to Watch|publisher =UK Polling Report|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref>

The Conservatives' choice of [[David Cameron]] as leader in late 2005 led senior Lib Dems to question whether Charles Kennedy was capable of dealing with future challenges facing the party. In a statement on 5 January 2006, Charles Kennedy admitted to a long battle with [[alcoholism]], and announced a [[Liberal Democrats leadership election, 2006|leadership election]] in which he intended to stand for re-election, while Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] took over as acting leader.<ref name="kennedystandsdown">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4591882.stm|title =Kennedy calls for Lib Dem contest|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref>

For several years there were rumours alleging that Kennedy had problems with alcohol <U+2013> the [[BBC]]'s [[Nick Robinson]] called it "Westminster's worst-kept secret".<ref name="worstkeptsecret">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/2006/01/westminsters_wo.html|title =Westminster's worst kept secret?|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> However, Kennedy had on previous occasions denied this: some suggested that he had deliberately misled the public and his party.<ref name="worstkeptsecret" /> His admission also attracted sympathy; he is a popular figure, and was thought to have enough support among Lib Dem members to win the leadership election.

====Campbell (2006<U+2013>2007)====
[[Image:Sir Ming Campbell MP 2008 cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Menzies Campbell]]: Leader from 2006 to 2007]]
Kennedy initially planned to stand as a candidate; he withdrew from the election citing a lack of support among Lib Dem MPs.<ref name="mingelection" /> Sir Menzies subsequently won the contest, defeating [[Chris Huhne]] and [[Simon Hughes]], in a race that saw [[Mark Oaten]] withdraw due to a lack of support and revelations about his visits to [[Male prostitution|rent boys]], [[Simon Hughes]] come under attack regarding his sexuality and [[Chris Huhne]] accused live on [[The Daily Politics]] of attempting to rig polls.<ref name="mingelection">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4765710.stm|title =Timeline: Lib Dem election|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref>

There was negative press over Kennedy's departure, however the leaderless party shocked by winning the [[Dunfermline and West Fife]] seat from Labour in a by-election in February 2006. This was viewed as a particular blow for [[Gordon Brown]], who lives in the constituency, represents the adjacent seat, and featured in Labour's campaign.<ref name="westfifebyelection">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4695270.stm|title =Lib Dems deliver blow to Labour|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> The party came second place by 633 votes in the [[Bromley and Chislehurst]] by-election, pushing Labour into fourth place behind [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP).<ref name="bromleybyelection">{{cite web|year = 2006|url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/hoc/constituency/0,9338,-769,00.html|title =Bromley and Chislehurst|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> In July 2007, Sir Menzies announced that the party wished to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20 to 16p per pound <U+2013> the lowest rate since 1916 <U+2013> which would be funded using green taxes and taxing money made from UK properties by non-UK residents eligible for [[Capital Gains Tax]].<ref name="4ptaxcut">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6293958.stm|title =Lib Dems plan 4p cut in tax rate|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref>

====Clegg (2007<U+2013>present)====
[[Image:Nick Clegg - Crop.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Clegg]]: Leader from 2007 to present)]]
On 18 December 2007, [[Nick Clegg]] won the leadership election, becoming the party's fourth leader. Clegg won the leadership with a majority of 511 votes (1.2%<!--511*100/(20988+20477), figures from "cleggleader" reference-->) over his opponent [[Chris Huhne]], in a poll of party members.<ref name="cleggleader">{{cite web|year =2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7148367.stm|title =Nick Clegg is new Lib Dem leader|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-02-06}}</ref> Clegg is the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]], and was an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for the [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands]] from 1999 to 2004.<ref name="cleggbackground">{{cite web|year =2007|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7046587.stm|title =The Nick Clegg story|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-02-06}}</ref>

In his acceptance speech, Clegg declared that he was "a liberal by temperament, by instinct and by upbringing" and that he believes "Britain [is] a place of tolerance and pluralism". His priorities are: defending civil liberties; devolving the running of public services to parents, pupils and patients; and protecting the environment,<ref name="cleggspeech">{{cite web|year =2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7150595.stm|title=Nick Clegg's speech in full|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref> and that he wanted to forge a "liberal alternative to the discredited policies of big government".<ref name="cleggbackground" /> He also proposed a target to double the number of Lib Dem MPs within two elections, and before the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2008|2008 local elections]] confirmed that he was pleased with their performance in the polls: "the polls yesterday were at 20%, that's considerably higher than 13% just a few years ago.

Shortly after election, Clegg reshuffled the party's [[Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team|Frontbench Team]], making Chris Huhne the replacement [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Affairs spokesperson]], [[Ed Davey]] the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Affairs spokesperson]], and keeping [[Vincent Cable]] as Shadow [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]].<ref name="cleggreshuffle">{{cite web|year =2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7153890.stm|title=Clegg reveals his frontbench team|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> His predecessors were also given roles: Campbell joined the all-party Commons foreign affairs select committee, and Kennedy is to campaign nationwide on European issues, as president of the UK's [[European Movement]].<ref name="cleggreshuffle" />

==Electoral results==
[[Image:LibDem vote-seat %.PNG|thumb|300px|Lib Dem vote and seat share 1983-2005]]
In [[United Kingdom general elections]], the Lib Dems succeeded the Liberal-SDP Alliance as the third most popular party, behind [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. Their popularity initially declined from levels achieved by the Alliance, however their seat count has risen to its peak of 63 seats, despite not achieving the vote levels of the Alliance; this was credited to improved skill at targeting vulnerable seats.<ref name="rennard" /> The vote percentage for the Alliance in 1987 and the Lib Dems in 2005 is similar, yet the Lib Dems won 62 seats to the Alliance's 22.<ref name="2005election">{{cite web|year =2005|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/constituencies/default.stm|title =Blair wins historic third term <U+2013> majority of 66|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref>

The [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system used in UK General Elections is not suited to parties whose vote is evenly divided across the country, resulting in those parties achieving a lower proportion of seats in the Commons than their proportion of the popular vote (see table and graph). The Lib Dems and their [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] and [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]] predecessors have suffered especially,<ref name="electoralreform">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/votingsystems/systems2.htm|title =Voting Systems|publisher =[[Electoral Reform Society]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> particularly in 1983 and 1987 when their electoral support was greatest; the increase in their number of seats in 1997, 2001 and 2005 was attributed to the weakness of the Conservatives, and the success of their election strategist [[Lord Rennard]].<ref name="rennard">{{cite web|year =2004|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/jul/17/uk.liberaldemocrats|title =No rest yet for wily architect of poll triumph|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-02-18}}</ref> Lib Dems state that they want 'three-party politics' in the Commons;<ref name="protests" /><ref name="2004localelection" /> the most realistic chance of power with first past the post is for the party to be the ''kingmakers'' in a [[hung parliament]].<ref name="coalition">{{cite web|year = 2007|url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/dec/19/politics.liberaldemocrats|title =If Clegg gets it right in 2008, he could bring the Lib Dems into government|publisher =[[The Guardian]]|accessdate =2008-03-23}}</ref> Party leaders often set out their terms for forming a coalition in such an event <U+2013> in 2008 [[Nick Clegg]] stated that the policy for the [[Next United Kingdom general election|next general election]] is to reform elections, parties and parliament in a 'constitutional convention'.<ref name="termsforhungparliament" />

==Structure==
The Liberal Democrats are a [[Federation|federal]] party of the parties of Wales, Scotland and England. Scotland and England are further split into regional parties. The parliamentary parties of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], the [[House of Lords]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[Welsh Assembly]] form semi-autonomous units within the party. The leaders in the House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament are the leaders of the federal party and the Scottish Party; the leaders in the other two chambers, and the officers of all parliamentary parties, are elected from their own number. The Lib Dems had around 73,000 members in 2004,<ref name="financialstatement">{{cite web|year =2004|url =http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/58519/Liberal-Democrats-Statement-of-Accounts-2007.pdf|format=PDF|title =Reports and Financial Statements |publisher =[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]]|accessdate =2008-09-22}}</ref> and in the first quarter of 2008, the party received [[GDP|<U+00A3>]]1.1 million in donations and have total borrowings and unused credit facilities of <U+00A3>1.1 million (the "total debt" figure reported by the Electoral Commission includes, for example, unused overdraft facilities). This compares to Labour's <U+00A3>3.1 million in donations and <U+00A3>17.8 million of borrowing/credit facilities, and the Conservatives' <U+00A3>5.7 million in donations and <U+00A3>12.1 million of borrowing/credit facilities.<ref name="2008finances">{{cite web|year = 2008|url =http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/new-figures-published-showing-political-parties-donations-and-borrowings|title =New figures published showing political parties' donations and borrowing|publisher =[[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)]]|accessdate =2008-09-22}}</ref> In 2005, the party received a donation of <U+00A3>2.4 million from businessman [[Michael Brown (Liberal Democrats donor)|Michael Brown]], the largest single donation in its history.<ref>{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1793681,00.html|title="The man who came from nowhere to bankroll the Liberal Democrats"|publisher=''The Times''|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref>

Like the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], the Lib Dems organise in [[Northern Ireland]], though they do not contest elections in the province: they work with the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland]], ''de facto'' agreeing to support the Alliance in elections.<ref name="allianceNI">{{cite web|year = 2001|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1545103.stm|title =Alliance Party faces uphill battle|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-03-21}}</ref> There is a small separate local party of the Lib Dems in Northern Ireland. Several individuals, including Alliance Party leader [[David Ford]], hold membership of both parties. Alliance members of the [[House of Lords]] take the Lib Dem [[whip (politics)|whip]] on non-Northern Ireland issues, and the Alliance Party usually has a stall at Lib Dem [[party conference]]s.

The party is a member of [[Liberal International]] and the [[European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party]], and their 11 MEPs sit in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) group in the [[European Parliament]].

===Internal factions===
Liberal Democrats can be classified into two factions <U+2013> social and market liberals <U+2013> which are unrelated to membership of the party's predecessors <U+2013> many social liberals (including [[Paddy Ashdown]]) were former Liberal MPs, and some market liberals (such as [[Vincent Cable]]) were from the SDP.

'''[[Social liberal]]s''' have dominated the party since its formation. Drawing inspiration from [[David Lloyd George]], [[William Beveridge]] and [[John Maynard Keynes]], this wing  advocates the [[welfare state]], higher taxation and public spending, government regulation to protect consumers, employees and the environment, and support [[civil liberties]] and [[human rights]]. Social liberals include [[Paul Holmes (politician)|Paul Holmes]], [[Norman Baker]] and [[Simon Hughes]].

The '''[[market liberal]]''' or '''[[libertarian]]''' wing shares with social liberals a belief in basic civil and political freedoms (''[[negative liberty|negative freedoms]]''). However, where social liberals argue that the state should provide social and economic rights to its citizens (''[[positive liberty|positive freedoms]]''), market liberals are non-interventionist and are critical of government's ability to increase freedom. This often manifests itself as support for greater [[economic freedom]], causing tension between the two wings. Many MPs from this wing contributed to the ''[[The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism|Orange Book]]'' (2004),<ref name="orangebook">{{cite web|year = 2004|url =http://www.bonkers.hall.btinternet.co.uk/liberator.html|title =Orange Blossom|publisher =[[Liberator (magazine)|Liberator]]|accessdate =2008-03-26}}</ref> a collection of essays intended to spark debate on a greater role for free-market liberalism in policy. Some party donors, journalists and party officials back this wing of the party.<ref name="freemarket">{{cite web|year = 2004|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3621340.stm|title = Lib Dems call for pro-market move|publisher =[[BBC]]|accessdate =2008-01-28}}</ref> Leading market liberals in the party include [[Vince Cable]], [[David Laws]] and [[Nick Clegg]].<ref name="orangebook" />
