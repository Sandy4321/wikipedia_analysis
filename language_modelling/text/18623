'''''Vanity Fair''''' is an American magazine of culture, fashion, and politics published by [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]].

==Cond<U+00E9> Nast's ''Vanity Fair''==
[[Image:Vanity Fair - February 1936.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Bali Beauty - One of the last issues of Cond<U+00E9> Nast's ''Vanity Fair'' before it was absorbed by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]]]
[[Cond<U+00E9> Montrose Nast|Cond<U+00E9> Nast]] began his empire by purchasing the men's fashion magazine ''Dress'' in [[1913]]. He is said to have paid $3,000 for the right to use the title "Vanity Fair" in the United States, but it is unknown whether the right was granted by an [[Vanity Fair (magazine, historical)|earlier]] English publication or some other source. 

Cond<U+00E9> Nast renamed the magazine ''Dress and Vanity Fair'' and published four issues in [[1913]]. After a short period of inactivity it was relaunched in [[1914]] as ''Vanity Fair''.

The magazine achieved great popularity under editor [[Frank Crowninshield]].  In [[1919]] [[Robert Benchley]] was tapped to become managing editor. He joined [[Dorothy Parker]], who had come to the magazine from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', and was the staff drama critic. Benchley hired future playwright [[Robert E. Sherwood]], who had recently returned from [[World War I]]. The trio were among the original members of the [[Algonquin Round Table]], which met at the [[Algonquin Hotel]], on the same West 44th Street block as Cond<U+00E9> Nast's offices.

Crowninshield attracted the best writers of the era. [[Aldous Huxley]], [[T.S. Eliot]], Ferenc Molnar, [[Gertrude Stein]], and [[Djuna Barnes]] all appeared in a single issue, July 1923. <ref>About Town, by [[Ben Yagoda]], Scribner, 2000, p. 37.</ref>

Starting in [[1925]] ''Vanity Fair'' competed with ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as the American [[establishment|establishment's]] top culture chronicle. It contained writing by [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[T.S. Eliot]] and [[P.G. Wodehouse]], theatre criticisms by [[Dorothy Parker]], and photographs by [[Edward Steichen]]; [[Claire Boothe Luce]] was its editor for some time.

The magazine was the darling of advertisers; in 1915 it published more pages of ads than any other U.S. magazine. <ref>About Town, by [[Ben Yagoda]], Scribner, 2000, pp. 36.</ref> It continued to thrive into the twenties. However, it became a casualty of the [[Great Depression]], and in [[1936]] ''Vanity Fair'' was folded into [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and ceased publication.

==Modern revival==
[[Image:Vanity Fair August 1991.JPG|thumb|150px|During pregnancy, American actress [[Demi Moore]] appeared naked on this famous ''Vanity Fair'' cover in August, [[1991]].]]The magazine was revived in its current form in the [[1980s]] by [[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]], under the ownership of [[Si Newhouse]]. Under editors [[Tina Brown]] ([[1984]]-[[1992]]) and [[E. Graydon Carter]] (since [[1992]]), ''Vanity Fair'' has enjoyed greater circulation, prestige and revenues, the latter attested by a plenitude of trendy advertisements. The magazine further boasts a number of prestigious [[columnists]] including [[Michael Wolff]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]].

[[Glamour photography|Glamour photographers]] such as [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Mario Testino]] and the late [[Herb Ritts]] have provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current [[celebrities]] and forgotten heroes. Amongst the most famous of these was the August [[1991]] cover featuring a naked, pregnant, [[Demi Moore]], an image that is replicated to this day.

Since its revival, the magazine has made news as well as told it. It was the subject of [[Toby Young]]'s book, ''[[How to Lose Friends and Alienate People]]'', about his search for success, from [[1995]], in [[New York]] working for Graydon Carter's ''Vanity Fair''. 

In [[1996]], journalist Marie Brenner wrote an [[expos<U+00E9> (journalism)|expos<U+00E9>]] on the [[tobacco industry]] entitled ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (article)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''. The article was later adapted into a movie ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' ([[1999]]), which starred [[Al Pacino]]. After more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the [[May 2005]] edition revealed the identity of [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]] ([[W. Mark Felt]]), the source for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' articles on [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], which led to the [[1974]] resignation of [[U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]].

The cover of ''Vanity Fair's'' annual Hollywood issue, an issue that each year assembles some of the biggest female names in American cinema to feature on its cover has been criticized somewhat. A feature in ''[[The Guardian]]'' about the [[2005]] Hollywood Edition said "I feel soiled gazing at this photograph, and it's not just jealousy. It reminded me of [[Supper at Emmaus (London) (Caravaggio)|Caravaggio's famous chicken]] in the National Gallery; it's just as pornographic. Leibovitz's cover is a simply a casting couch, a homage to the blowjob values of [[1950s]] Hollywood." <ref> [http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1403966,00.html The vanity, the vanity] ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 2, 2005 </ref>

Another issue whose cover courted controversy was the [[March 2006]] [[Tom Ford]]'s [[Hollywood]] Special Edition: the cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz, featured [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]] both nude; accompanied by a fully-clothed Tom Ford, standing in for [[Rachel McAdams]] who had backed out when she learned of the requirements of the shoot.

In keeping with this high-profile pre-Oscar event, the magazine also hosts an extremely exclusive [[Academy Awards]] after party.

Also in August 2006, Annie Leibovitz was the photographer of a photo shoot for the [[October 2006]] issue at the [[Telluride, Colorado]] home of [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]]. The shoot was of the couple and their daughter, Suri Cruise, who had previously been "hidden," without any pictures, causing many to start to deny her existence.

The cover of Vanity Fair's first Art Issue (in December 2006) also drew controversy after it depicted [[Brad Pitt]] naked except for a pair of white boxers. Although Pitt had signed a release for the image, which was taken in September 2005, he claims he did not expect it to emerge on the magazine cover more than a year later. Vanity Fair has said that it obtained the rights for the image, as part of a collection, and that it had issued a letter to Pitt informing him, prior to the publication.

In February 2007, the first German issue of Vanity Fair was published.

==Controversy==
====Controversial pictorials====
In addition to the sometimes controversial nature of some of ''Vanity Fair's'' covers, some of their other pictorials have garnered criticism. The April [[1999]] issue featured an image of actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] dressed as a [[Hindu]] deity for a photo spread by [[David LaChapelle]]: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.<ref> [http://www.saja.org/vf.html SAJA Vanity Fair article], 9 June, 2000 </ref>

====Polanski libel case====
In [[2005]], ''Vanity Fair'' was found liable in a [[lawsuit]] brought in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by film director [[Roman Polanski]], who claimed the magazine had [[libel]]led him in an article published in [[2002]], accusing him of boorish behavior and child molestation following the murder of his wife [[Sharon Tate]] in [[1969]].  A [[2002]] article in the magazine written by [[A. E. Hotchner]] recounted a claim by [[Lewis Lapham]], editor of ''[[Harper's]]'', that Pola<U+0144>ski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was travelling to Sharon Tate's funeral, claiming that he could make her "the next Sharon Tate". The court permitted Pola<U+0144>ski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom.<ref> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4019031.stm Polanski takes appeal to Lords] [[BBC News]] (online), 17 November, 2004 </ref> The trial started on [[July 18]], [[2005]], and Pola<U+0144>ski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of [[Mia Farrow]] and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant [[Elaine's]] could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Pola<U+0144>ski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her "the next Sharon Tate". 

[[Image:Lindsay Lohan - Vanity Fair.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lindsay Lohan on the January 2006 cover of ''Vanity Fair'']]

Pola<U+0144>ski was awarded <U+00A3>50,000 damages by the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] in London. The case was notable because Polanski was living in France as a fugitive from U.S. justice, and never appeared in the London court for fear he would be extradited to the U.S and [[Graydon Carter]], editor of ''Vanity Fair'', responded, "I find it amazing that a man who lives in France can sue a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom," while Samantha Geimer commented, "Surely a man like this hasn't got a reputation to tarnish?" <ref> [http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/printables/050919roco02?print=true How I spent my summer vacation in London being sued by Roman Polanski<U+2014>and what I learned about "solicitors," pub food, and the British chattering class], by [[Graydon Carter]], ''Vanity Fair'', 19 September, 2005 </ref>

====Lindsay Lohan interview====
In [[January 2006]], ''Vanity Fair'' published a cover feature and an interview with [[Lindsay Lohan]] in which she admitted using drugs "a little", although she denied ever using cocaine, describing it as a "sore subject". The article said she had recovered from "[[bulimia nervosa|bulimic]] episodes", and that her 2005 hospitalization was for "a swollen liver and kidney infection". <ref name="vf1">{{cite web | title=news.yahoo.com | work=Reuters: Lindsay Lohan Admits Drug Use, Bulimia Battle | url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060104/people_nm/lohan_dc_3 | accessdate=4 January | accessyear=2006}}</ref> Lohan later said she was "appalled" that her words were "misused and misconstrued" for the article; the magazine however replied that "Every word [was recorded] on [[magnetic tape|tape]]. ''Vanity Fair'' stands by the story."<ref name="vf2">{{cite web | title=Lindsay Lohan says she's 'appalled' by 'Vanity Fair' article | work=USA Today Article | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-10-lohan-vanity-fair_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | accessdate=9 July | accessyear=2006}}</ref>
