'''''Pee-wee's Big Adventure''''' is a [[1985 in film|1985]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] in his full-length film debut. [[Paul Reubens]], [[Phil Hartman]] and [[Michael Varhol]] wrote the script, starring Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman, [[Elizabeth Daily]], [[Mark Holton]] and [[Diane Salinger]]. The film tells the story of Pee-wee Herman embarking on nation-wide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle.

The success of ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]'' prompted [[Warner Bros.]] to hire Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-Wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of ''[[Pollyanna#1960 film|Pollyanna]]'' with Pee-wee Herman in the [[Hayley Mills]] role. Burton was hired as director once Reubens and the producers saw his work on ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'' and ''[[Frankenweenie]]''. ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' was a financial and critical success and became a [[cult film]].

==Plot==
<!---This is sufficient detail for the article.  Haphazard additions compromise readability---->
Pee-wee Herman, a strange man who acts like a child, loves his bike more than anything else in the world and refuses to sell it to nemesis Francis Buxton, a fellow man-child and neighborhood "rich kid". The bike is stolen after Pee-wee visits a magic shop, ensuing into a high-profile campaign to find it. To grip with his insanity of the missing bike, Pee-wee visits a false psychic who lies and tells him that the bike is hidden in the basement of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]]. Pee-wee hitches a ride with a man named Mickey, a fugitive on the run from the law because he cut off a "do not remove under the penalty of law" [[mattress tag]]. Mickey abandons Pee-wee after Pee-wee accidentally nearly kills the two of them. 

Pee-wee is picked up by Large Marge, learning at a truck stop diner that Large Marge was actually a ghost. Pee-wee meets Simone, a friendly waitress with a yearning to see [[Paris]]. Her huge boyfriend Andy thinks Pee-wee and Simone were romantically linked, chasing Pee-wee and causing him to flee in a boxcar of a moving train. Making it to San Antonio he finds that the Alamo has no basement, realizing his whole trip was a sham and goes to the bus station to return home. On his journey he breaks the world record for bull-riding and runs afoul of a [[biker gang]] known as the [[Satan]]'s Helpers (after accidentally knocking over their motorcycles). Fearing they are trying to kill him, Pee-wee dances to "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]" and wins the respect of the bikers. The bikers give him a motorcycle, but Pee-wee quickly crashes it, being sent to the hospital. Pee-wee learns from the television that his bike now belongs to Kevin Morton, a spoiled child star who is currently filming a movie with the bike as a prominent prop.

Pee-wee sneaks into [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]] and locates the set on which Kevin is acting. Pee-wee disguises himself as a [[nun]] in order to infiltrate the set and steal his bike back. In a wild chase scene, he flees from the Warner Bros. security staff through a variety of sets. Various actors and props, including a boat-shaped car, a [[Santa Claus]] sleigh, and a man in a [[Godzilla]] costume, get swept into the chase. He also interrupts the shooting of a [[Twisted Sister]] music video for "Burn in Hell" from [[Stay Hungry (Twisted Sister album)|''Stay Hungry'']]. Using the gadgets on his bike, Pee-wee manages to evade the guards and escape the studio. As he blissfully rides away, however, Pee-wee discovers a pet shop in flames. After heroically saving all the animals (even the snakes which creep him out), Pee-wee faints on the store's doorstep, just as the fire department and police arrive. When [[emergency medical technician]]s come to revive Pee-wee, a fireman gets in an argument with a policeman, because the firefighter considers Pee-wee a hero, but the police officer places Pee-wee under arrest.

Pee-wee is brought before a Warner Bros. [[studio executive]] who offers to buy Pee-wee's [[life rights]] in exchange for dropping all charges. Pee-wee agrees and attends the premiere at his local drive-in. All of the friends Pee-wee made during his trip come to see the film, and Pee-wee greets each of them. He ends with Dottie, having finally fulfilled her demands for a date at the drive-in. As a final act of vengeance, Pee-wee allows Francis to sit on his bike, who  triggers the ejector seat and sends him flying. Pee-wee's movie turns out to be a cheesy [[James Bond]]-style action film involving [[James Brolin]] and [[Morgan Fairchild]] fighting ninjas. Pee-wee has a cameo appearance as a bellhop, but his voice is comically dubbed over. After watching for a few minutes, Pee-wee decides to leave, having already lived the real story. Rejoined with his bike, he rides away with best-friend Dottie, happily ever after.

==Production==
The success of ''[[The Pee-wee Herman Show]]'' prompted [[Warner Bros.]] to hire [[Paul Reubens]] to write a script for a full-length Pee-Wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of ''[[Pollyanna#1960 film|Pollyanna]]'' with Pee-wee Herman in the [[Hayley Mills]] role. Reubens claims that ''Pollyanna'' is his favorite film. Half-way through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script.<ref name=audio>[[Paul Reubens]], [[Tim Burton]], [[audio commentary]], 2000, [[Warner Bros.]]</ref>
