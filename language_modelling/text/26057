'''''The Incredible Hulk''''' is a [[2008 in film|2008]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] released on [[June 13]], [[2008]]. It is directed by [[Louis Leterrier]] and stars [[Edward Norton]] as Dr. Bruce Banner / the Hulk, [[Liv Tyler]] as [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]], [[William Hurt]] as [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] and [[Tim Roth]] as [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]. The film follows Banner as he flees the pursuit of General Ross while attempting to find a cure to rid himself of the Hulk. When Blonsky personally volunteers to be injected with Banner's gamma formula to aid Ross in his capture, he becomes an even greater monster, and Banner must accept his inner beast to defeat Blonsky.

After the [[2003 in film|2003]] film ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', [[Marvel Studios]] reacquired the rights to the character, and writer [[Zak Penn]] began work on a loose sequel that would be much closer to the comics and the [[The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|television series]]. Norton rewrote the script after he signed on to star, severing all ties to its predecessor by retelling the [[origin story]] in flashbacks and revelations, thereby establishing the film as a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. Leterrier's direction aimed to make the monsters look more realistic and frightening. He redesigned Blonsky's monstrous gamma-irradiated form &mdash; called the Abomination in the comics &mdash; from a [[reptilian humanoid]] into a mutated man with bony protrusions. Filming mostly took place in [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]] in 2007, where the production attempted to be [[#Filming and editing|environmentally friendly]].

==Plot==
The film's [[back-story]] is detailed during [[flashback]]s, which are mostly in the [[opening credits]], and further [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]]. [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]] ([[William Hurt]]) hired scientist and [[radiation]] expert [[Hulk (comics)| Dr. Bruce Banner]] ([[Edward Norton]]) to revive a [[World War II]] era military bio-force enhancement research project (to create "[[Supersoldiers#Comic books|supersoldiers]]"; later scenes imply Banner was kept in the dark about this application of his work). Banner exposed himself to [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], which results in him becoming a giant, green-skinned monster called the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and hospitalizing Ross' daughter [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty]] ([[Liv Tyler]]), who was Banner's colleague and lover. Now a fugitive from the [[United States Army]], Banner went on the run for five years. 

When the film begins, Banner is an employee of a bottling factory in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], while attempting to find a cure for his condition with the help of an [[Internet]] friend, "Mr. Blue". He is also taught martial arts and meditative breathing techniques by an expert ([[Rickson Gracie]]) to help control his emotions, and has not transformed for 158 days. After Banner suffers a cut, his blood drips into a soda bottle eventually drank by an ill-fated consumer ([[Stan Lee]]) in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. This accident points Ross to Banner's location and he sends a team, led by the Russian-born British special operations expert [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]] ([[Tim Roth]]), to capture him. Banner escapes Blonsky by transforming into the Hulk and battling his team in the factory. After Ross explains to Blonsky how Banner first became the Hulk, an astonished and vengeful Blonsky declares he wants Banner's power. Ross arranges for Blonsky to be injected with the [[Captain America|Vita-ray serum]], which has been kept in [[Refrigeration|cold storage]], gaining him enhanced physical abilities.

Banner returns to Culver University in the United States, where the Hulk was born. He reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist [[Doc Samson|Leonard Samson]] ([[Ty Burrell]]). On the day he decides to leave, Ross and Blonsky's forces attack Banner at Culver University, forcing him to transform. Blonsky proves to be athletic and agile enough to compete with the Hulk thanks to the serum, and Ross attempts to contain the Hulk with two sonic cannons. This ploy fails, when the Hulk shields himself with two sheets of metal, and Blonsky breaks every bone in his body after being kicked by the Hulk. The Hulk flees with Betty, who became unconscious after a helicopter he struck crashed nearby. After he calms down and becomes human again, Banner and Betty travel to [[New York City]] to meet "Mr. Blue". The two maintain a low profile as the Hulk's existence becomes public knowledge and a matter of national security following the university battle.

Banner and Betty meet "Mr. Blue", who is [[Leader (comics)|Dr. Samuel Sterns]] ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), at a university. Accompanying him to his lab, Banner and Betty learn that Sterns has developed a possible [[antidote]] that may cure Banner's condition, or merely reverse each individual transformation. Despite the risk, Banner agrees to test Sterns' antidote, which requires triggering a transformation and reversing it. Successful, Sterns reveals that he has synthesized Banner's blood sample into a large supply with the intention of using it to enhance the human condition to the next evolutionary level. Appalled by what Sterns had done and fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the wrong hands, Banner attempts to convince Sterns to destroy the blood supply, but he is attacked by Ross' forces and taken into custody.

A recovered Blonsky forces Sterns to inject him with the Hulk's blood. Sterns warns that the combination of the supersoldier formula (which Blonsky has overdosed on, mutating his skeleton) and a gamma treatment would be an unpredictable combination that could turn him into an "abomination". Unconcerned, Blonsky makes Sterns administer the gamma charge, and he mutates into a powerful monster. He knocks Sterns aside and escapes, rampaging through [[Harlem]] to draw the Hulk out. At the lab, an irradiated sample of Banner's blood-derivative drips into an open wound on Sterns' temple, causing his [[cranium]] to mutate and expand.

Banner, realizing that he is the only one who can stop the monster, convinces General Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter as it hovers over the city, hoping the fall will trigger a transformation. Banner's plan succeeds, and after a brutal battle, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a huge chain, relenting his grip only after Betty's plea<!-- he is breathing and moving when released from the chain-->. The Hulk then flees the scene with the army in pursuit.

Thirty-one days later, Banner is in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]]. Instead of trying to suppress his transformations, he is attempting to initiate them in a controlled manner. As his eyes turn green, a grin appears on his face. Meanwhile, General Ross is drinking in a bar when he is approached by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) who reveals that a [[Avengers (comics)#Film|"team"]] is being put together.

Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=con07>{{cite news | author = Edward Douglas | title = Live from Comic-Con: The Marvel Studios Panel! | publisher = [[Superhero Hype!]] | date = [[2007-07-28]] | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=6100 | accessdate=2007-07-29}}</ref> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name="penn on norton"/> He initially turned down the part for this film, recalling "there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be," as he felt the previous film "strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story". When he met Letterier and Marvel, however, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project. Thus, Norton rewrote the script.<ref name=mull>{{cite news | title = Edward Norton | publisher = [[Total Film]] | date = [[2008-03-07]] | url = http://www.totalfilm.com/features/world_exclusive_edward_norton_talks_incredible_hulk | accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref> "Norton's script has given Bruce's story real gravitas," Letterier said. "Admittedly I'm not the most adult director, but just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]."<ref name=frenchie/> 

:'''[[Lou Ferrigno]]''' voices '''The Hulk''': During the 2008 New York Comic Con director Louis Leterrier offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=dh>{{cite news | author = Jeff Otto | title = Special Report: "Hulk" Edit Bay Visit | publisher = [[Dark Horizons]] | date = [[2008-05-27]] | url = http://www.darkhorizons.com/news08/080527a.php | accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref> Ferrigno also has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film as a security guard who is bribed by Banner with a pizza.<ref name=editbay1/>

'''[[Liv Tyler]]''' as '''[[Betty Ross Banner|Dr. Elizabeth "Betty" Ross]]''': Bruce's girlfriend, whom he is separated from due to his condition, and a [[cellular biology|cellular biologist]]. Tyler replaced actress [[Jennifer Connelly]], who portrayed Betty Ross in the 2003 film ''Hulk''. Tyler was attracted to the love story in the script, and was a fan of the TV show, because of the "humanity and what [Banner] is going through".<ref name=con07/> Tyler and Norton spent hours discussing Bruce and Betty's life before he became the Hulk.<ref name=empire/> She said filming the part "was very physical, which was fun",<ref>{{cite news | author = Donna Freydkin | title = Liv Tyler loves being the Givenchy girl | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2007-11-29]] | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-11-29-liv-tyler_N.htm | accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> and compared her performance to "a deer caught in the headlights", because of Betty's shock as Bruce's unexpected return into her life.<ref name=empire/>

'''[[Tim Roth]]''' as '''[[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]]''': A Russian-born officer from the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] loaned to General Ross. Recognizing he is past his prime, he lusts after the Hulk's power. The character is known as the "Abomination" in the comics, but Zak Penn considered this name too silly, and he is only referred to as Blonsky on screen.<ref name=abombsilly>{{cite news | author = Scott Collura | title = Hulk Villain Talk | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-05-03]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/785/785584p1.html | accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> Roth said he took the part to please his sons, who are comic-book superhero fans. As a teenager, Roth was a fan of the 1970s TV series, and he also found Leterrier's ideas "very dark and very interesting." Roth started watching the 2003 film to prepare for the part, but stopped as he did not want to be caught up in the controversy over its quality, and to compare himself to it.<ref name=controversy>{{cite news | author = Jake Rossen | title = Q&A: Tim Roth | publisher = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date = [[2008-03-27]] | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/032708rothqanda.html | accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref>

Leterrier is a fan of Roth's work, and felt "it's great watching a normal [[Cockney]] boy become a superhero!",<ref name=frenchie/> but Marvel and Norton were initially reluctant to cast him.<ref name=posttrailer>{{cite news | title = Director Louis Leterrier on The Incredible Hulk | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2008-03-13]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/features/hulk/1.asp | accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref> Before he was cast in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]'', [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]] was in discussions for the role.<ref>{{cite news | title = Ray Stevenson Brings the Pain | publisher = [[Maxim]] | url = http://www.maxim.com/RayStevensonBringsthePain/articles/21031.aspx?src=news:feature2 | accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> Roth found it tough playing Blonsky: although he constantly chases Banner, Roth could not work out because he had to portray Blonsky's aging that foreshadows his desire to become a powerful monster.<ref name=empire/> [[Cyril Raffaelli]] performed some of Roth's stunts.<ref name=nycc/> Roth enjoyed the [[motion capture]], which reminded him of [[fringe theatre|fringe theatre]], and he hired his trainer from ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' to aid him in portraying the monster's movement.<ref name=empire/>

'''[[William Hurt]]''' as '''[[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]]''': Betty's father, who has dedicated himself to capturing the Hulk. Letterier cast Hurt because "Ross is more physical, more explosive in this movie, and no actor goes from zero to 100 as well as William."<ref name=frenchie/> He compared Ross to [[Moby-Dick#Ahab|Captain Ahab]].<ref name=posttrailer/> The Hulk is Hurt's favorite superhero, and his son is also a big fan of the character.

[[Robert Downey, Jr.]] cameos as [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] at the end of the film, reprising his role from ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]''.

Additionally, the late [[Bill Bixby]] appears, when a scene featuring Bixby on his TV [[comedy-drama]] ''[[The Courtship of Eddie's Father]]'' plays on a television Banner is watching at the beginning of the film. [[Rickson Gracie]] has a small role as Bruce Banner's martial arts instructor, despite his [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] background, he is credited as an [[Aikido]] instructor.

At the time of the release of [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'', screenwriter [[James Schamus]] was planning a sequel, featuring the Gray Hulk.

Norton explained of his decision to ignore Lee's [[origin story]], "I don't even like the phrase origin story, and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning."<ref name=con07/> "Audiences know this story," he added, "[so] deal with it artfully."

Marvel chose the Abomination as the villain because he was the most famous enemy, and because he would be an actual threat to the Hulk, unlike [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross]].<ref name=threat>{{cite news | title = Louis Letterrier Discusses Villains for The Incredible Hulk | publisher = Superheroflix | date = [[2007-11-28]] | url = http://www.superheroflix.com/news/00/24700.php | accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> For Blonsky's "abomination" form, Letterier updated Blonsky's [[KGB]] background from the comics, making him a soldier.

Leterrier had to direct four [[second unit|units]] with a broken foot.<ref name=frenchie>{{cite news | title = News Etc. | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = April 2008 | pages = 15-16}}</ref> Filming began on [[July 9]], [[2007]].<ref name=incrediblereturn/> [[Hamilton, Ontario]] was the shooting location for the factory where Blonsky first encounters the Hulk, as well as part of their fight in New York. They also shut down [[Yonge Street]], in [[Toronto]], for four nights in September to shoot the Hulk and Blonsky's clash at [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]]. Toronto also provided for the film's sets. They also shot at the [[University of Toronto]], Morningside Park and the [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]]; [[CFB Trenton]] in [[Trenton, Ontario]]; and at a glacier in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]].<ref name=notes/> Afterwards, there was a week-long shoot in [[New York City]] and two weeks in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=cfb>{{cite news | title = Hulk Filming at CFB Trenton | publisher = [[Superhero Hype!]] | date = 2007-07-31 | url = http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=6113 | accessdate=2007-10-02}}</ref> While in that city, the crew shot in [[Lapa (Rio de Janeiro)|Lapa]], [[Tijuca Forest]] and [[Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro)|Santa Teresa]]. Filming concluded in November after eighty-eight days of filming.<ref name=notes/> 

''The Incredible Hulk'' joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon emissions and waste created during filming.<ref>{{cite news | author = Tim Lai | title = City's film industry aim to be eco-friendly | publisher = [[Toronto Star]] | date = [[2007-09-11]] | url = http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/255120 | accessdate=2007-09-12}}</ref> Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] acknowledged the Hulk, being green, was a popular environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. [[Hybrid vehicles|Hybrid]] and [[Fuel efficiency in transportation|fuel efficient]] vehicles were used, with low [[sulfur]] [[diesel]] as their energy source. The construction department used a sustainably harvested, locally sourced yellow [[pine]] instead of [[lauan]] for the sets, and also used zero-or low-[[Volatile Organic Compounds|VOC]] paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used; cloth bags; biodegradable food containers; china and silverware food utensils; a stainless steel mug for each production crew member; a contractor who removed bins; recycled paper; biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices; and the sound department used rechargeable batteries.<ref name=notes/>

===Effects===
[[Image:Hulk screenshot from the trailer.jpg|thumb|350px|The Hulk faces down Emil Blonsky.]]
Leterrier had planned to use [[prosthetic makeup]] and [[animatronic]]s to complement the [[computer-generated imagery]] that was solely used in the previous film.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/hulknews.php?id=4720 | title= Director Louis Leterrier on ''The Incredible Hulk''! | publisher=[[Superhero Hype!]] | date=[[2006-09-15]] | accessdate=2006-11-06 }}</ref> Norton and Roth provided [[motion capture]] for their characters, and filmed their fights on a stage with 37 digital cameras.<ref name=frenchie/> Leterrier cited the motion capture potrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] by [[Andy Serkis]] (from ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'') as the standard he was aiming for.<ref name=keown/> The two actors filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's "thunder claps").<ref name=notes/> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, while [[Image Engine]] spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-iradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref>{{cite news | author = Marke Andrews | title = Vancouver's visual effects makers bulk up | publisher = [[The Vancouver Sun]] | date = [[2008-04-11]] | url = http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=be3cd777-c4b8-4b3e-b6e8-b4fb4220dd3b&k=63189 | accessdate=2008-04-12}}</ref>

[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had "too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off". He explained, "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he<U+2019>s like a tank."<ref name=keown/> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=notes>{{cite news | author = [[Universal Studios]] / [[Marvel Studios]] | title = Production notes | date = 2008-06-01 | url = http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/06/01/the-incredible-hulk-production-notes/ | accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Drew McWeeny]] | title = AICN EXCLUSIVE!

[[Image:Greeneyes.PNG|thumb|200px|Bruce Banner's eyes turn green as he transforms into the Hulk.]] 
Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of "an [[<U+00FC>ber]]-human" like the Hulk. Instead, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle.<ref name=posttrailer/> The character also shares Roth's tattoos.<ref>{{cite news | author = Shawn Adler | title = 'Incredible Hulk' Baddie Tim Roth Offers A Glimpse Into His 'Fascinating Character' And Monstrous Alter Ego | publisher = [[MTV]] | date = [[2008-04-24]] | url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1586154/story.jhtml | accessdate=2008-04-24}}</ref> A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character.<ref name=notes/> Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of [[Mike Tyson]] when he fought [[Evander Holyfield]]), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Rob Worley]] | title = Louis Leterrier on 'The Incredible Hulk' controversies | publisher = Comics2Film | date = 2008-06-13 | url = http://www.comics2film.com/index.php?a=story&b=33783 | accessdate=2008-06-13}}</ref>

The make-up artists who worked on ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' created Blonsky's gradual transformation.<ref name=controversy/> Zak Penn said they approached his mutation as "not [being] used to having these properties. Like he's much heavier, and we talked about how when he walks down the sidewalk, his weight destroys the sidewalk and he's tripping. [It's all about] the humanization of these kinds of superhero characters, showing the effects physics may actually have on [them]."<ref name=abombsilly/>

===Music===

Norton and Leterrier disputed with the producers over the final running time: they wanted it to be near 135 minutes, while the producers wanted the film to be under two hours. This was made public, and rumors spread that Norton "made it clear he won't cooperate with publicity plans if he's not happy with the final product".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/movies/10hulk.html | author = Brooks Barnes | title = What<U+2019>s Big and Green, and Desperate to Be a Hit All Over? | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = [[2008-04-10]] | accessdate=2008-04-10}}</ref> Norton dismissed this, "Our healthy process [of collaboration], which is and should be a private matter, was misrepresented publicly as a 'dispute', seized on by people looking for a good story, and has been distorted to such a degree that it risks distracting from the film itself, which Marvel, Universal and I refuse to let happen.

Universal and its promotional partners have tried to position ''The Incredible Hulk'' as a franchise reboot similar to ''[[Batman Begins]]''. Effort was made to promote the story as having a romance and a physical antagonist, and the title was used for promotional puns (such as [[7-Eleven]]'s "Incredible Gulp" slurpees, and "Incredible Dad" themed [[Father's Day]] gifts at [[Kmart]]). [[Burger King]] also promoted the film, and [[General Nutrition Centers]] used the title character as a role model for strength training.<ref name=bulk>{{cite news | author = T.L.

Rene Rodriguez of ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' applauded that the film "does a lot of things [Ang] Lee's ''Hulk'' didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity".<ref>[http://www.miami.com/incredible-hulk-pg-13-article Rodriguez, Rene. ''The Miami Herald'': Review, June 13, 2008]</ref> Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way <U+2014> except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks".<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2004471790_hulk13.html Rahner, Mark. ''The Seattle Times'': Review, June 13, 2008]</ref> [[Lou Lumenick]] of ''[[The New York Post]]'' said, "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [Ang] Lee took".<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/06122008/entertainment/movies/green_day_115208.htm Lumenick, Lou. ''The New York Post'': Review, June 13, 2008]</ref>

Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that "the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict".<ref>[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jun/12/hulk-a-big-let-down/ Lemire, Christy.

Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, "'The Adequate Hulk' would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean".<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/movies/13hulk.html Scott, A.O. ''The New York Times'': Review, June 13 2008.]</ref> [[David Ansen]] of ''[[Newsweek]]'' wrote, "Leterrier has style, he's good with action and he's eager to give the audience its money's worth of bone-crunching battles. Still, once the movie leaves the atmospheric Brazilian settings, nothing in this "Hulk" sinks in deeply: its familiar genre pleasures are all on the surface. ... The movie's scene stealer is Tim Blake Nelson, making a comically welcome third act appearance as the unethical but madly enthusiastic scientist Samuel Stern".<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/141172 Ansen, David.
