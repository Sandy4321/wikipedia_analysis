'''Frederick Russell Burnham''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] ([[May 11]], [[1861]] <U+2013> [[September 1]], [[1947]]), was an American [[military scout|scout]] and world traveling adventurer known for his service to the [[British Army]] in [[Colonial Africa]] and for teaching ''woodcraft'' (i.e., [[scoutcraft]]) to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], thus becoming one of the inspirations for the founding of the international [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].

Burnham had little formal education, attending but never graduating high school. He began his career at the age of 14 in the [[American Southwest]] as a scout and tracker. Burnham then went to Africa where this background proved useful. He soon became an officer in the British Army, serving in several battles there. During this time, Burnham became friends with Baden-Powell, and passed on to him both his outdoor skills and his spirit for what would later become known as Scouting.

Burnham eventually moved on to become involved in [[espionage]], oil, conservation, writing and business. His descendants are still active in Scouting.

== Early life ==
Burnham was born to a [[missionary]] family on an Indian Reservation in Tivoli, [[Minnesota]]. As a toddler, he witnessed the burning of [[New Ulm, Minnesota]], by [[Taoyateduta]] (Little Crow) and his [[Sioux]] warriors in the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. During the uprising, his mother, Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham, hid the not quite two-year-old boy in a basket of green corn husks and fled for her life. Once the Sioux had been driven away the mother returned to find the house burned down. Her young son was safe, fast asleep in the basket and protected only by the corn husks.<ref name="davis">{{cite book | last =Davis | first =Richard Harding | authorlink =Richard Harding Davis | coauthors = | title =Real Soldiers of Fortune | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons | date =1906 | location =New York | pages = | url =http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3029| id = ISBN 0873642392}}</ref><ref name="scouting">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | coauthors = | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page and Co | date =1926 | location = | pages = 2| id = ASIN B000F1UKOA }}</ref>

The young Burnham attended schools in Iowa and there he met Blanche Blick, the girl who would later become his wife. His family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1870. Two years later his father, the Rev. [[Edwin Otway Burnham]] of Kentucky, himself a long time pioneer and missionary along the border of the Sioux Indian reserve in Minnesota, died when Burnham was only 11 years old. While the rest of the family returned to Iowa, the young Burnham stayed in California to make his own way.<ref name="pressreflib">{{cite book | title =Press Reference Library: Notables of the West | publisher =International News Service | date =1915 }}</ref>

For the next three years, Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the [[Western Union Telegraph Company]] in California and [[Arizona]]. At age 14, he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the [[Apache Wars]]. He traveled in northern [[Mexico]] and the American Southwest, including [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], earning a living as a buffalo hunter, cowboy, and prospector, and he continued working as a scout while tracking Indians in the [[Cheyenne War]]. The young Burnham eventually went on to attend high school in California but never graduated.<ref name="pressreflib">{{cite book | title =Press Reference Library: Notables of the West | publisher =International News Service | date =1915 }}</ref>

In 1882, Burnham returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of [[Pinal County]], but he soon went back to cattle and mining interests. He joined the losing side of the [[Pleasant Valley War|Tonto Basin Feud]] before mass killing started, and only narrowly escaped death in Arizona.<ref name="scouting">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | authorlink =Frederick Russell Burnham | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page and Co | date =1926 | location = New York | pages = Chapters 3 & 4 | id = ASIN B000F1UKOA }}</ref><ref name="blackwoodtontobasin">{{cite journal| author =R.

In the 1880s the American press had been popularizing the notion that the West had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in the United States. This idea changed Burnham's life. Ever the soldier of fortune, he began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier. When he heard of the work of [[Cecil Rhodes]] and his pioneers in building the [[Cape to Cairo railway]] in Africa, Burnham sold what little he owned and, in 1893, set sail to [[Cape Town, South Africa]], with his wife and young son. He soon joined the [[British South Africa Company]] as a scout and headed north. Burnham became well known in Africa for his ability to track, even at night, and the Africans dubbed him ''He-who-sees-in-the-dark.''<ref name="jameswest">{{cite book | last =West | first =James E. | authorlink =James E.

==Military career==
[[Image:Burnham in africa close up.jpg|left|thumb|Burnham in Africa (middle) holding his Remington Model 1875 No. 3 Army in .44WCF rifle]]
===First Matabele War===
{{details|First Matabele War}}
Burnham<U+2019>s first major test in Africa came in 1893 when the British South Africa Company went to war with the [[Matabele]] King [[Lobengula]]. [[Leander Starr Jameson|Jameson]] had hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal city of [[Bulawayo]]. Burnham and a small group of scouts were sent ahead to report on the situation in Bulawayo. While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the white troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo.<ref name="wilsonmatabeleland">{{cite book | last =

====Shangani Patrol====
After he found that Bulawayo had been abandoned, Jameson dispatched a column of soldiers to locate and capture Lobengula. The column, led by Maj. [[Patrick William Forbes|Patrick Forbes]], camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of [[3 December]] [[1893]]. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men, under the command of Maj. [[Allan Wilson (Major)|Allan Wilson]], were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula<U+2019>s whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.<ref name="efknight">{{cite book | last =Forbes | first =Archibald | authorlink = | coauthors =Arthur Griffiths, George Alfred Henty, and E. F. Knight| title =Battles of the Nineteenth Century | publisher =Castle and Company Ltd| date =1896 | location =London, Paris, Melbourne | pages = 110-119}}</ref>

Soon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the laager requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson<U+2019>s patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning, however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson<U+2019>s patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other scouts, Pearl <U+201C>Pete<U+201D> Ingram (a [[Montana]] cowboy) and George Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, "I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party." Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.<ref name="efknight">{{cite book | last =Forbes | first =Archibald | authorlink = | coauthors =Arthur Griffiths, George Alfred Henty, and E.

===Second Matabele War===
[[Image:After mlimo.jpg|thumb|right|Burnham & Armstrong after the assassination of Mlimo. Matabele warriors in hot pursuit.]]
{{details|Second Matabele War}}
In March 1896, the Matabele again revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in [[Zimbabwe]] as the First War of Independence. Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. Matabeleland defenses were in disarray due to the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]], and the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such legendary figures as Burnham, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], and [[Selous]]. An estimated 50,000 Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills]] near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting against the white settler patrols.<ref name="fcselous">{{cite book | last =Selous | first =Frederick Courteney | authorlink =Frederick Selous | title =Sunshine and Storm in Rhodesia| publisher =R.

====Assassination of Mlimo====
The turning point in the war came when Burnham and a young scout named Bonar Armstrong found their way through Matobo Hills to the sacred cave where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two scouts tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered.<ref name="nyt25jun1896">{{cite journal| author =| date=June 25, 1896| year=1896| month=June | title=Killed the Matabele God: Burnham, the American scout, may end uprising| journal=[[New York Times]] | ISSN=0093-1179 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E7DF123BEE33A25756C2A9609C94679ED7CF |accessdate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart.<ref name="nyt25jun1896"/> 

The two scouts then leaped over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses. Hundreds of warriors, encamped nearby, picked up their arms and searched for the attackers. To distract the Matabele, Burnham set fire to the village. The two white men got on their horses and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes boldly walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the [[impi]] to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.<ref name="farwell">{{cite book | last =Farwell | first =Byron | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Land Warfare: An Illustrated World View | publisher =W.

With the war over, Burnham decided it was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family returned to California where Burnham left his wife and young son Bruce with his mother. Soon after, he and his eldest son Roderick, then 12 years old, traveled to [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]] to prospect in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].<ref name="scouting">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | coauthors = | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page and Co | date =1926 |id = ASIN B000F1UKOA }}</ref>

===Second Boer War===
[[Image:Burnham 1902 loc collection.jpg|right|thumb|Burnham 1902]]
{{details|Second Boer War}}
In January 1900, while prospecting in [[Skagway, Alaska]], Burnham received the following telegram: ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.'' Although Cape Town is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, he left within the hour.<ref name="americanheritage">{{cite journal| author=Byron Farwell| date=March 1976| year=1976| month= March| title= Taking Sides in the Boer War| journal=American Heritage Magazine| volume =20| issue=3|issn=0002-8738 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1976/3/1976_3_20.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> He would arrive at the front just before the [[Battle of Paardeberg]] and, during the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines, gathering information, and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was twice captured and twice escaped, but he was also invalided for a time by his near fatal wounds. Unusual for a foreigner, Burnham was given a commission by Lord Roberts and the rank of captain.<ref name="americanheritage">{{cite journal| author =Byron Farwell| date=March 1976| year=1976| month=March | title= Taking Sides in the Boer War| journal=American Heritage Magazine| volume=20| issue=3| issn=0002-8738| url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1976/3/1976_3_20.shtml| accessdate=03-07-2007}}</ref>

Burnham was first captured while trying to warn a British column approaching [[Thaba Nchu|Thaba' Nchu]].<ref name="atlantaconstitution8apr1900">{{cite journal| date=April 8, 1900| year=1900| month=April | title=American scout escapes| journal=[[Atlanta Constitution]] issn=0093-1179}}</ref> He came upon a group of Boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the British were even then advancing. Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush while Burnham was at once made prisoner. In the fight that followed Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee. Limping heavily and groaning with pain, he was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded, and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheelers of the wagon, lowered himself and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant the body of the wagon had passed over him, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veldt, and had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of "mealies" (i.e., maize).<ref name="scouting">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | authorlink =Frederick Russell Burnham | coauthors = | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page and Co | date =1926 | location = New York |id = ASIN B000F1UKOA }}</ref><ref name="nyt1901">{{cite journal| author =| date=May 5| year=1901| month=May | title=England's American Scout| journal=[[New York Times]]| volume=| issue=| issn=0362-4331| url= http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E0DD1139E733A25756C0A9639C946097D6CF | accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>

On [[June 2]], [[1900]], while trying by night to blow up the bridge on the Pretoria-[[Delagoa Bay]] railway line at [[Bronkhorstspruit]], {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} east of [[Pretoria]] and a vital link to the sea, Burnham was surrounded by a party of Boers and could save himself only by instant flight. He had all but got away when a bullet caught his horse and it crashed to the ground dead, crushing Burnham beneath it and knocking him senseless. He continued in a dazed state for nearly a day and when he came to he found that both friends and foes had departed. Although still suffering the most acute agony, Burnham heroically crept back to the railroad, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. Knowing the explosion would soon bring the Boers, on his hands and knees he crept to an empty [[kraal]] and laid there for two days and nights insensible. Upon hearing the sound of distant firing, Burnham set forth on his hands and knees toward the fighting. By then he was indifferent as to whether it came from the enemy or his own people, but, as it chanced, he was picked up by a friendly patrol and carried to Pretoria. The surgeons discovered that in his fall Burnham had torn apart the muscles of the stomach and burst a blood-vessel. That his life was saved, so they informed him, was due only to the fact that for three days he had been without food. His injuries were so serious that he was ordered to England by Lord Roberts. Two days before leaving for London, he was promoted to the rank of major .<ref name="scouting">{{cite book | last =Burnham | first =Frederick Russell | authorlink =Frederick Russell Burnham | coauthors = | title =Scouting on Two Continents | publisher =Doubleday, Page and Co | date =1926 | location = New York |id = ASIN B000F1UKOA }}</ref><ref name="latimes4aug1900">{{cite journal| author =| date=Aug 4, 1900| year=1900| month=August | title=Southern California by Towns and Counties: Fred Burnham now a Major in British Army; Recovering from His Injuries| journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]| issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref name="latimes2mar1902">{{cite journal| author =| date=March 2, 1902| year=1902| month=March | title=Burnham's services brought to the attention of Parliament: He maintains his well-known modesty.

==Father of Scouting==
[[Image:Bp burnham ca1910.jpg|right|thumb|Burnham (standing) & Baden-Powell (right) at a Boy Scout event, ca. 1910]]
Burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War.

During the siege of Bulawayo, the two men rode many times into the Matobo Hills on patrol, and it was in these African hills that Burnham first introduced Baden-Powell to the ways and methods of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], and taught him ''woodcraft'' (better known today as [[scoutcraft]]).<ref name="scoutingforboys">{{cite book | last =Baden-Powell | first =Robert | authorlink =Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell | coauthors = | title =Scouting for Boys: A Handbook for Instruction in Good Citizenship | publisher =H.

===Oil wealth===
In 1923, Burnham struck oil at Dominguez Hill, California. In the first 10 years of operation, the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $10.2 million in dividends.<ref name="hammond">{{cite book | author=[[John Hays Hammond]] | title=The Autobiography of John Hays Hammond | publisher =Farrar & Rinehart| year=1935 | pages=754 | id=ISBN 0-40505-913-2}}</ref> Although Burnham had lived all over the world, he never had a great deal of wealth to show for it. Ironically, it was not until he returned to the place of his youth that Burnham struck it rich.

===Conservation===
An avid [[conservationist]] and [[hunter]], Burnham supported the early conservation programs of his friends Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa with the goal of finding large animals such as [[Giant Eland]], [[hippopotamus]], [[zebra]], and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen.

==Personal life==
===Appearance===
At 5&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in(1.62&nbsp;m), Burnham was slight, but he was also muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes that appeared to never leave yours, and yet could see everything behind you and about you, above and below you. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.<ref name="days">{{cite book |last=Haggard |first=H.

===Mannerisms===
Burnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing it would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell. He practiced subduing his brain to infinite patience, taking [[power naps]] instead of long sleep, and he drank less liquid than perhaps anyone else. He trained himself to these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water, he might still be able to exist -- and on more than one occasion he survived when most would have died, or did die, of exhaustion. To him scouting was as exact a study as is the piano, and it was said that he could read the face of nature as easily as most could read their morning newspaper. He was also quiet-mannered, courteous, talked without any of that shyness that comes from self-consciousness, and extremely modest, seldom speaking of his many adventures.<ref name="days">{{cite book |last=Haggard |first=H.

===Family===
[[Image:Blanche blick burnham in africa 1896.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Blanche Blick Burnham in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, 1896]]
Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche Blick Burnham ([[February 25]], [[1862]] - [[December 22]], [[1939]]) of [[Nevada, Iowa]], accompanied him in very primitive conditions through many travels in both the Southwest United States and Southern Africa. They had three children together, but just one survived into adulthood. In the early years, she watched over the children and the pack animals, always careful to keep a rifle within arms length. In the dark of night, she used her rifle many times against [[lions]] and [[hyena]] and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Ndebele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near [[Three Rivers, California]]. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1926, the Burnhams moved to a mansion in a new housing development then known as [[Hollywood, California|Hollywoodland]], and took many trips around the world in high-style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery.<ref name="familyletters">{{cite book | last =Bradford | first =Mary E | authorlink = | coauthors =Richard H Bradford | title =An American family on the African frontier: the Burnham family letters, 1893<U+2013>1896 | publisher =Roberts Rinehart Publishers| date =1993 | location =Niwot, Colorado| pages = | id =ISBN 1879373661}}</ref><ref name="vanwyk">{{cite book | last =van Wyke | first =Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Burnham: Chief of Scouts | publisher =Trafford Publishing| date =2003 | location =Victoria, Canada| id =ISBN 1879373661}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Ernest Hemingway]] acquired the rights to produce a film version of ''Scouting on Two Continents'' in late 1958. [[CBS]] immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television, with [[Gary Cooper]] expressing an interest in playing the part of Burnham. Hemingway was already behind schedule in his other commitments and never started on the film when he committed suicide in July 1961.<ref name="hemingway">{{cite book | last =Hemingway | first =Ernest | authorlink =Ernest Hemingway | coauthors =[[A.
