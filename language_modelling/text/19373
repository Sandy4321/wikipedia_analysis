== Political career ==

Corbett<U+2019>s family had been leaders in Oregon<U+2019>s [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] for three generations.  Both his father and two great-grandfathers were elected to public office as Republicans.  However, Corbett became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 1949, initially serving as a Democratic committeeman in Multnomah County.<ref name="TO2"/>

In 1952, Corbett ran for Oregon<U+2019>s District 3 seat in the [[United States House of Representative]].  He won the Democratic primary.  In the general election, his opponent was [[Homer D. Angell]], the incumbent Republican.  During the campaign, Corbett accused Angell of being an [[isolationist]] because of several Congressional votes Angell made prior to the outbreak of World War II.  The accusation made Angell so mad that he walked out of a public debate with Corbett.<ref name="TO2"/><ref>Harvey, Paul W., Jr, "Landslide for Ellsworth Predicted; Angell May Expect Close Election", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 24 November 1952, p. 23.</ref>  In the end, Corbett lost the election.<ref name="TO1"/><ref name="TO3">"Corbett<U+2019>s Seatting Decided on Basis of Conscience", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 13 January 1953, p. 7.</ref><ref name="TO4">"Corbett Expects to Run for State Secretary Job", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 20 February 1964, p. 33.</ref>    

A few months after the 1952 election, a state representative from Multnomah County died unexpectedly.  Corbett was appointed to fill the vacant seat in Oregon<U+2019>s State House of Representatives.<ref name="TO3"/><ref>Shoemaker, Mervin, "Board Selects Corbett; Dickson Plan Contest", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 24 December 1952, p. 1.</ref> He served in the Oregon legislature<U+2019>s 1953 regular session.<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1953reg.html "1953 Regular Session (47th): January 12-April 21"], ''Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide'', Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, accessed 24 May 2015.</ref>  In 1954, his Multnomah County constituents elected him for a second term.<ref>"Klamath Falls Man, Ed A.

In 1956, Corbett ran for a seat in the state senate. He won the Democratic primary in May<ref>"How Oregon cast Ballots in State, National Races", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 22 May 1956, p. 1.</ref> and then the general election in November.<ref>"Demos Lead Multnomah County in Clean Sweep", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 8 November 1956, p. 17.</ref>  During his four-year term, Corbett serve in the 1957 regular session<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1957spec.html "1957 Regular Session (49th): January 14-May 21"], ''Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide'', Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, accessed 24 May 2015.</ref> and a special session later that year<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1957spec.html "1957 Special Session: October 28-November 15"], ''Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide'', Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, accessed 24 May 2015.</ref> as well as the 1959 regular session.<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1959reg.html "1959 Regular Session (50th): January 12-May 6"], ''Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide'', Oregon Secretary of State, Salem, Oregon, accessed 24 May 2015.</ref>  As a sentaor, Corbett served as co-chairman of the legislature<U+2019>s powerful Joint Ways and Means Committee.<ref>Shoemaker, Marvin, "New state Budget Top Old mark by $50,000,000", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 19 May 1957, p. 1.</ref>

Corbett was re-elected to the state senate in 1960.  After the election, Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the state senate 20 to 10.  The senate<U+2019>s Democratic caucus selected Corbett as their party leader and candidate for President of the Senate.<ref>"Corbett<U+2019>s Gavel Sure", ''Sunday Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 29 November 1959, p. 2.</ref>  However, when the senate gathered to elect its officers in January 1961, senate Republicans joined conservative Democrats to elect a more conservative Democrat, [[Harry D.

During his twelve years in the Oregon legislature, Corbett was an important leader.  He served as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee twice, chairman of the Legislative Fiscal Committee, and chairman of the Labor and Industries Committee along with various other committee appointments.<ref name="GEP"/>

Corbett left the senate in 1964 to run for Secretary of State, Oregon<U+2019>s second highest elective office. <ref name="TO4"/>  While he won the Democratic primary, he lost the general election to [[Tom McCall]], a very popular Republican who later became [[List of Governors of Oregon|governor of Oregon]].

== Later life ==

After losing the Secretary of State election, Corbett was considered for re-appointment to the Oregon State Senate when an incumbent Democratic senator, [[Walter J. Pearson]], became seriously ill.  However, Corbett had just accepted an appointed position in [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]]<U+2019>s administration.<ref name="TO1"/><ref>"Reports Continue that State Sen. Pearson Will Resign Office", ''The Oregonian'', Portland, Oregon, 31 January 1965, p. 33.</ref>

A few months after the 1964 election, President Johnson appointed Corbett to a senior position in the legal office of the [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity]] in Washington, District of Columbia.  In this position, Corbett played a leading role in the Johnson administration<U+2019>s [[war on poverty]].<ref name="TO1"/><ref name="GUL"/>  

When the [[Legal Services Corporation]] was created in 1974, Corbett joined the organization.  The Legal Services Corporation was chartered by the Federal government to provide legal assistance to low-income people. He served as chairman of the corporation's Project Review Board, the group that reviewed funding applications for legal aid programs. Corbett worked to preserve legal services for the poor when the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] tried to disband the corporation.<ref name="TO1"/><ref name="GUL"/>
 
Corbett retired in 1978.  After retiring, he moved to a cattle ranch near [[Tumalo, Oregon|Tumalo]] in [[Central Oregon]].  Eventually, he and his wife moved to [[Camp Sherman, Oregon]], where they live through most of the 1990s.  Corbett died on 10 November 2000 in Poulsbo, Washington.  He is buried at the River View Cemetery in Portland.<ref name="TO1"/>
