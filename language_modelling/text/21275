==Biography==

===Overview===

She was born as Barbara Goutscher in Reichenberg (now [[Liberec]]), [[Sudetenland]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. Her place of birth is now in the [[Czech Republic]], but she had to leave that country as a small child along with her family and the rest of her community. She was brought up in the [[United States]] and the country and [[culture]] in which she has spent most of her life, is [[Italy]] where she has lived since 1970 and which she considers home <ref name = Intervista/>. It is where she met her husband, married, raised a family and pursued her career <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positifcinema.com/barbarabouchet.htm |title=Incontro con Barbara Bouchet|accessdate=2007-01-12 |author=Lombardini, Luca|language=Italian }}</ref>.

===Background===

After the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], meeting at the [[Potsdam agreement|Potsdam Conference]] in 1945, formalised their policy agreement on [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War II|the systematic transfer of the Germans from Eastern Europe]] <ref> {{Citation| last = Prauser| first = Stefan| last2 = Rees| first2 = Arfon| title = The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War| journal = European University Institute, Florense| url =http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf}}, 2004 </ref>, which included the Sudeten Germans.

The enactment and implementation of the [[Bene<U+0161> decrees]] after the Allied victory in 1945, meant that the Sudeten Germans were considered to have been [[Collective punishment| collectively punished]] <ref> The Makers of War, Neilson, Francis, Flanders Hall Publishers, ISBN 0-895-62093-6, 1950 </ref>, by the Czechs, who regarded them as being untrustworthy and disloyal to Czechoslovakia because they had given their support to the [[Munich Agreement]] <ref> National Cleansing - Retribution against Nazi Collaborators in Postwar Czechoslovakia, Frommer, Benjamin, Cambridge University Press, ISBN 0-521-81067-1, 2005 </ref>,which had led to the incorporation of the Sudetenland into [[Germany]] in [[1938#September| 1938]].

The decision to transfer the Germans, reinforced, as it was, by the terms of the new laws that came into effect, after the Allied liberation of Czechoslovakia in 1945, led to the confiscation of Sudeten German land, property and possessions. These events were to have profound consequences for the Goutscher family as not only were they required to leave their home and belongings but they were also made [[Stateless person|stateless]].

Little Barbara Goutscher, who had been nearly 2 years old at the time of the end of the [[World War II|war]], accompanied her family, as they were transferred from the country. They were placed, along with many others, in a [[Refugee camp| resettlement camp]] in the [[History of Germany since 1945#Four occupation zones| American occupation zone]] in Germany, from where they were, in time, able to apply for, and be granted, permission to emigrate. 

Like many other [[refugees]], at that time, in [[post-war]] [[Europe]], the family discovered, to their relief, that they were eligible to [[Human migration| migrate]] to the United States, as a result of the [[humanitarian]] provisions of the Displaced Persons Act <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/history/1948displacedpersonsact.htm|title=Displaced Persons Act, 1948|accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> which had been legislated by [[80th United States Congress|Congress]] in 1948. <ref> A Terrible Revenge, De Zayas, Alfred Maurice, Palgrave Macmillan, ISBN 1-403-97308-3, 2nd edition, 2006 </ref>

===Youth===

After arriving in [[United States|America]], her family was, eventually, able to settle in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], where the young Barbara Goutscher was raised and where she, later, attended the [[Galileo High School#Notable alumni| Galileo High School]] which is situated at the crossroads between the [[Russian Hill]] and [[Marina District, San Francisco, California#Famous residents past and present| Marina District]] areas of the city, drawing students mainly from those two neighborhoods. 

In [[1959 in film#Films released in 1959| 1959]], spurred by the popularity of the film ''[[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]'', [[KPIX-TV]], the local television station covering the [[San Francisco Bay Area| San Francisco Bay area]],  decided to hold a ''"Miss Gidget"'' [[Beauty contest| beauty and talent contest]] on the ''[[KPIX-TV#Dick Stewart Television Show| Dick Stewart Television Show]]''. The contest was open to all teenage girls in the local area, she entered and won, resulting in her first experience of fame. Subsequently, she went out on a date with the male star of the movie : [[James Darren#Personal life| James Darren]].

The station offered her, as a prize, the chance, which she accepted, to become one of the ''"Regulars"'' in a dance group on the show, called ''The KPIX Dance Party'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kpixdanceparty.org/index.html|title=KPIX Dance Party|accessdate=2007-07-16|author=Interiano, Manny}}</ref>. They were teenage dancers who danced live to the top pop and rock and roll hits of the day and were TV stars, by virtue of the attention they received by being on television six days per week.

She was on the show from [[1959 in television#Television shows| 1959]] through [[1962 in television| 1962]], after which she moved to the [[Hollywood]] area and made it into the film industry, changing her harsh [[Germanic languages| Germanic]] sounding surname to the softer [[French language| French]] sounding Bouchet which had a more fashionable, social [[cachet]].

===Career===

Barbara Bouchet began her career [[Model (person)|modeling]] for magazine covers and appearing in television commercials, before eventually becoming an actress. Her first acting role was a minor part in ''[[What a Way to Go!]]'', a [[Romantic comedy film| romance]], [[1964 in film#Films released in 1964| 1964]], which led to a series of other roles in the [[1960s]], all of which emphasised her beauty, looks and figure making her a [[sex symbol#Film| sex symbol]].

Examples are such films as : ''John Goldfarb, Please Come Home'', a [[comedy]], [[1964 in film#Films released in 1964|1964]], in which she is dressed in alluring  [[harem]] [[silk]] robes, ''[[In Harm's Way]]'', a war drama, [[1964 in film#Films released in 1964|1964]], in which she is seen nude on the beaches of [[Pearl Harbor]], and ''[[Agent for H.A.R.M.]]'', a spy action film, [[1966 in film#Films released in 1966|1966]], in which she wears a bikini for most of the time that she is on screen.

Moreover, in the [[1967 in film#Top grossing films|1967]] [[James Bond]] [[satire]], ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', she added a sultry element to the otherwise restrained [[Miss Moneypenny]]. Her early films gave her the grounding in character development that she needed in order to tackle more substantial roles later on in her career. She guest starred in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[By Any Other Name]]", in [[1968 in television#1960s|1968]], which has a memorable scene where [[William Shatner]] kisses her repeatedly.

In 1970, she moved to Italy where she began acting in [[Italy|Italian]] films after growing tired of being [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] and where she began to star in the leading roles that were being denied to her in Hollywood. She rapidly became one of the top actresses in the country as she was constantly in demand due to her strong professional work ethics, her natural acting abilities, and her grace, style and beauty. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mymovies.it/dizionario/biblio.asp?a=1192|title=Barbara Bouchet Biografia|accessdate=2007-01-12|author=Regoli, Alessandro|language=Italian}}</ref>

Her films, produced in Italy, can be categorised into three main [[Film genre| genres]] : ''[[giallo]]'', ''[[poliziottesco]]'', and ''commedia erotica all'italiana'', (''[[sex comedy]]''). Gialli combine crime, horror and [[eroticism]]. Poliziotteschi are police, crime and action thrillers while Commedia erotica all'italiana brings together bawdy humour and farce which was especially liberating in Italian society, as it was part of the [[sexual revolution]] that was sweeping Italy at that time.

In [[1971 in film|1971]], she starred with two other [[Bond girls]], [[Claudine Auger]] and [[Barbara Bach]] in ''La Tarantola dal ventre nero'', (''Black Belly of the Tarantula'') a giallo mystery film. Some notable films that she was in, at this [[era]], were two giallo films that she starred with [[Rosalba Neri]] : ''Alla ricerca del piacere'', (''Amuck''), [[1971 in film|1971]], in which they have a [[lesbian]] love making scene together and ''Casa d'Appuntamento'', (''French sex murders''), [[1972 in film|1972]], a murder [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]. She starred in ''[[Milano calibro 9]]'', [[1971 in film|1972]], with [[Gastone Moschin]], a violent, poliziottesco, gangster film.

Other films that she starred in, and which were greeted with critical acclaim, were films such as ''[[Don't Torture a Duckling|Non si sevizia un paperino]]'', [[1972 in film|1972]], a giallo film noted for its dark subject matter relating to child killings and directed by the Italian [[horror film|horror master]], [[Lucio Fulci]] and ''L'Anatra all'arancia'', (''Duck in Orange Sauce''), [[1975 in film|1975]], a [[farce|farcical]], commedia erotica all'italiana, in which, she starred with [[Monica Vitti]].

She starred with [[Yul Brynner]] in ''Con la rabbia agli occhi'', known in English, as ''Death Rage'', [[1976 in film|1976]], a giallo [[mafia]] film and also that same year with [[Marty Feldman]] in ''40 gradi all'ombra del lenzuolo'', (Sex with a Smile), a commedia erotica all'italiana set as five farcical pieces in one film.  

In the [[1980s]] she became a [[television personality]] on Italian television, typically appearing on a [[chat show]] with fellow Italian [[actor|actress]], [[Edwige Fenech]]. She starred with [[Gregory Peck]] in ''[[The Scarlet and The Black]]'', [[1983 in film#Films released in 1983|1983]], a successful [[World War II|WWII]] war rescue [[TV movie]].

In 1985, she established a production company and started to produce a successful series of keep fit books and videos. In addition, she opened a fitness studio in [[Rome]], Italy.

In [[2002 in film#Films released in 2002|2002]], she returned to [[Cinema of the United States|American Cinema]], starring with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] in ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', a film about the violence between the criminal underworld and [[immigrant]] gangs in [[New York City|New York]], in which she appears as Mrs Schermerhorn.
