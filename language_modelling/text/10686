"'''Partial Terms of Endearment'''" is the twenty-first episode of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. Directed by Joseph Lee and written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], the episode originally aired on [[BBC Three]] in the United Kingdom on June 20, 2010, and has never been allowed to air in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], the original television network of the series. In "Partial Terms of Endearment", [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is approached by an old friend from college who asks her to become a [[surrogate mother]].  After arguing with her husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] who is against the idea, Lois decides to become a gestational carrier and undergoes [[in vitro fertilisation]].  However, while Lois is pregnant, the biological parents are killed in an automobile accident. Lois and Peter have to decide whether to abort the fetus, or carry it to term and give the baby up for adoption.  Peter attempts to persuade his wife to get an abortion before changing his mind after [[Pro-life|pro-life activists]] convince him that abortion is murder.

The episode was banned from airing on the Fox Broadcasting Company due to concerns over its portrayal of the controversial subject of abortion.  This is the second episode of ''Family Guy'' to be prevented from airing during the episode's respective regular season run; the first episode, [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season's]] "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]", eventually aired on [[Cartoon Network]]'s adult-oriented block [[Adult Swim]], unlike "Partial Terms of Endearment".  It was first announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].

Critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised the storyline, cultural references, and its assessment of the subject of abortion. The episode was watched in just under a million homes in its original airing in the United Kingdom. Guest performances included [[Gary Beach]], [[Jackson Douglas]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Will Sasso]], [[Julia Sweeney]], [[Wil Wheaton]] and [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. "Partial Terms of Endearment" was released on DVD along with ''Seth and Alex Almost-Live Comedy Show'' on September 28, 2010.

== Plot ==
While attending her college reunion at [[Salve Regina University]] with her husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], Lois spots Naomi Robinson, an old friend whom she dated and experimented with in school.  Peter is shocked, but excited to discover that Lois had dated a woman a college. Naomi indicates that she would like to discuss a proposal of some importance with them at their home.  Assuming he will participate in a three-way with his wife and Naomi, Peter throws [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] out of the house. After Naomi arrives at the [[Griffin family]] home, she introduces her husband, Dale.  Peter still expects to have sex with the group, and tries to seduce the three of them while dressed in various costumes. As the four decide to have a discussion in the family room, Peter expresses his disappointment that they will not be participating in an [[orgy]].  This causes Naomi to reveal her and her husband's difficulties in conceiving a child. Naomi asks Lois whether she will consider being the couple's surrogate, leading Lois to think the matter over.

The next morning, as the family is eating breakfast, Lois reveals her intention to become a surrogate mother for Naomi and Dale, causing Peter to become upset at the thought of her being pregnant for nine months. Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] performed.  A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals a car crash, with Dale and Naomi pronounced dead at the scene. Devastated by the announcement, Lois questions whether she should [[Abortion|abort]] the baby, or put it up for adoption. In an attempt to come to a decision, Lois and Peter decide to visit the local family-planning center, and ultimately decide to abort the embryo.  However, as Peter exits the center he encounters an anti-abortion rally, where he is shown an anti-abortion video by one of the protesters.  The video causes him to change his mind about aborting the unborn baby.  Returning home, Lois continues to advocate her right to choose, while Peter now attempts to argue the unborn child's right to life and whether Lois has the responsibility of carrying it to term. At their wits' end, the two decide to discuss the matter, once and for all. The next day, Lois talks with the family about "the wonderful new member of the Griffin family". But then Peter, at the very last moment of the episode, says that the abortion had occurred anyway.<ref name="UKairedate">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sttg1|title=BBC <U+2013> BBC Three Programmes <U+2013> Family Guy, Series 8, Partial Terms of Endearment|publisher=BBC Three|accessdate= 2010-06-15}}</ref>

In the opening scene of the episode, Peter and Lois are shown entering her [[alma mater]] at [[Salve Regina University]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quahog.org/factsfolklore/index.php?id=124 |title=The Road to Rhode Island |work=Quahog.org |publisher=''Best of Rhode Island'' |accessdate=2010-08-06}}</ref> Later, after they are approached by Lois's ex-roommate Naomi and her husband Dale, Lois announces her intention to carry the couple's baby, causing Peter to question why Lois is the one who has to become the couple's surrogate. Their daughter, Meg, then suggests that she could carry the baby herself, with Lois objecting due to Meg's inability to have a boyfriend "for more than a few weeks." Meg then notes her relationship with ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character [[Count von Count]], who only left her after discovering she had three [[nipple]]s.<ref name="nyt2"/>

Before Lois prepares to undergo in vitro fertilisation, Dr. Hartman shows her several photos of babies conceived by celebrity couples, including actress [[Shelley Duvall]] and singer-songwriter [[James Blunt]], actress [[Hilary Swank]] and actor [[Gary Busey]], Olympic medalist [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] and physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], and actress, writer and comedian [[Tina Fey]] and actor [[Joaquin Phoenix]].<ref name="tableread">{{cite video |date= 2010-09-28 |title= Family Guy Partial Terms of Endearment Table Read |people=Viener, John|medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> Later, in an attempt to cause Lois to have a miscarriage, Peter lays down a series of ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' DVDs in order to lure Lois into being punched in the stomach by the "[[Acme Corporation|Acme]] Miscarriage Kit", a boxing glove attached to a [[crossbow]].

As Peter exits the abortion clinic, he notices a pro-life rally nearby.  At the rally, a protester shows Peter a video tape discouraging abortion, portraying it as [[murder]], [[larceny]], [[jaywalking]] and [[securities fraud]].

Reviews of the episode's release on DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode "wickedly funny, no matter how offensive."<ref name="apreview"/> [[Frazier Moore]] of the [[Associated Press]] commented that "What, in other hands, could have been a serious, even heart-wrenching story is on ''Family Guy'' a devilish burlesque <U+2014> not to mention a wickedly astute examination of the current abortion clash."<ref name="apreview"/> Moore also noted, however, that "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass."<ref name="apreview"/> Dave Itzkoff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' deemed the episode "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters."<ref name="nyt2"/> In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of [[IGN]] criticized the episode for its [[shock value]], but appreciated "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." White went on to comment that it was "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" and that "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter." White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating.<ref name="ign">{{cite web |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/112/1124423p1.html |title=Family Guy "Partial Terms of Endearment" DVD Review |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2010-09-30 |date=2010-09-29 |last=White |first=Cindy}}</ref> Assessing ''Family Guy''{{'}}s impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of [[Salon.com|Salon]] commented on the portrayal of abortion: "That ''Family Guy'', that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should be one of the few shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas {{interp|...}} And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have <U+2014> that they're just not ready for motherhood."<ref name="salon">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/life/broadsheet/2010/07/20/family_guy_television_abortion/index.html |title=American TV: Still not ready for an abortion |publisher=''Salon'' |accessdate=2010-08-30 |date=2010-07-20 |last=Williams |first=Mary Elizabeth}}</ref>
