'''Gary Earl Johnson''' (born January 1, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] politician, businessman, and member of the Libertarian Party. Johnson served as the [[List of Governors of New Mexico|29th Governor]] of [[New Mexico]] from 1995 to 2003, as a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and was the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]].<ref name="reuters">{{cite web |url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/06/us-usa-libertarians-idUSBRE8440BZ20120506 |title = Libertarians nominate ex-Governor Gary Johnson for president |agency = [[Reuters]] |date = May 5, 2012 |accessdate = May 6, 2012 |author = Pratt, Timothy }}</ref>

Born in [[Minot, North Dakota]], Johnson moved with his family to New Mexico in his childhood. While a student at the [[University of New Mexico]] in 1974, Johnson sustained himself financially by working as a door-to-door [[handyman]]. In 1976 he founded Big J Enterprises, which grew from this one-person venture to become one of New Mexico's largest construction companies.<ref name="No, no, two hundred times">{{cite news |title = No, no, two hundred times no |first = Peter |last = Eichstaedt |newspaper = State Legislatures |date = July 1, 1995 |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17162855.html }}</ref> He entered politics for the first time by running for [[New Mexico gubernatorial election, 1994|Governor of New Mexico in 1994]] on a [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]], low-tax, anti-crime platform.<ref name="Gary Johnson on the Issues">{{cite news |title = Gary Johnson on the Issues |newspaper = [[The Santa Fe New Mexican]] |date = May 30, 1994 |page = A4 }}</ref> Johnson won the [[Republican Party of New Mexico]]'s gubernatorial nomination, and defeated incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor [[Bruce King]] by 50% to 40%.

Johnson sought [[New Mexico gubernatorial election, 1998|re-election in 1998]], winning by 55% to 45%.

== Governor of New Mexico ==

=== First term ===
{{See also|New Mexico gubernatorial election, 1994}}
Johnson entered politics in 1994, with the intention of running for governor and was advised by "Republican Elders"<ref name="He Just Said No to the Drug War" /> to run for the [[New Mexico Legislature|State Legislature]] instead.<ref name="He Just Said No to the Drug War" />  Despite their advice, Johnson spent $500,000 of his own money and entered the race with the intent of bringing a "common sense business approach" to the office.<ref name="America's Most Dangerous">{{cite news |title = America's Most Dangerous Politician&nbsp;<U+2014> Republican Governor of New Mexico Gary E.

Johnson subsequently won the general election, defeating the incumbent Democratic Governor [[Bruce King]] by 50% to 40%. Johnson was elected in a nationally Republican year, although party registration in the state of New Mexico at the time was 2-to-1 Democratic.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.npr.org/2012/06/21/155504668/gary-johnson-offers-third-choice-in-2012-elections |title = Gary Johnson Offers Third Choice In 2012 Elections | publisher = NPR |date = June 21, 2012 |accessdate = January 8, 2012}}</ref>

As governor, Johnson followed a strict small government approach. According to former New Mexico [[Republican National Committee]] member [[Mickey D. Barnett]], "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always was to ask if government should be involved in that to begin with."<ref name=Maverick /> He vetoed 200 of 424 bills in his first six months in office <U+2013> a national record of 47% of all legislation <U+2013> and used the [[line-item veto]] on most remaining bills.<ref name="No, no, two hundred times" />  In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget.<ref name="No, no, two hundred times" />  In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million [[State income tax|income tax]] cut, and a 6 cents per gallon [[Fuel taxes in the United States|gasoline tax]] cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-257.html |title = A Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors:1996 |first1 = Stephen |last1 = Moore |first2 = Dean |last2 = Stansel |date = July 26, 1996 |publisher = [[Cato Institute]] |accessdate = November 20, 2010 }}</ref> During the [[United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996|November 1995 federal government shutdown]], he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm in negotiations against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the [[budget deficit]] through proportional cuts across the budget.<ref>{{cite news |title = Governors In G.O.P.

=== Second term ===
{{See also|New Mexico gubernatorial election, 1998}}
In 1998, Johnson ran for re-election as governor against Democratic Albuquerque [[List of mayors of Albuquerque|Mayor]] [[Martin Chavez]]. In his campaign, Johnson promised to continue the policies of his first term: improving schools; cutting state spending, taxes, and bureaucracy; and frequent use of his veto and line-item veto power.<ref>{{cite news |title = Democrats Renew Push in New Mexico |first = B.

"He compared attempts to enforce the nation's drug laws with the [[Prohibition in the United States|failed attempt at alcohol prohibition]]. Half of what government spends on police, courts and prisons is to deal with drug offenders."<ref name=Sun />  He suggested that drug abuse be treated as a health issue, not as a criminal issue. His approach to the issue garnered supportive notice from conservative icon [[William F. Buckley]],<ref>{{cite web |author = Buckley, William F. |date = June 29, 2004 |url = http://old.nationalreview.com/buckley/buckley200406291207.asp |title = Free Weeds: The marijuana debate |work = [[National Review]] |accessdate = April 21, 2011 |authorlink = William F.

In 2000, Johnson proposed a more ambitious voucher program than he had proposed the year before, under which each parent would receive $3,500 per child for education at any [[private school|private]] or [[parochial school]].<ref name="Parents Lead Way as States" />  The Democrats sought $90m extra school funding without school vouchers, and questioned Johnson's request for more funding for state-run prisons, having opposed his opening of two private prisons.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=13954 |title = Political Brawl Leaves New Mexico Without Budget |first = Jon |last = Lieberman |date = March 14, 2000 |publisher = [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] |accessdate = May 8, 2011 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081127182751/http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&languageId=1&contentId=13954 |archivedate = November 27, 2008 }}</ref> Negotiations between the governor and the legislature were contentious, again nearly leading to a [[government shutdown]]. In 2000, New Mexico was devastated by the [[Cerro Grande Fire]]. Johnson's handling of the disaster earned him accolades from the ''[[The Denver Post]]'', which observed that:
<blockquote> Johnson.....was all over the Cerro Grande Fire last week. He helped reporters understand where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn't, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting state and federal agencies and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car.

=== Reception ===
Conservative commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] quoted a claim that Johnson "is highly regarded in the state for his outstanding leadership during two terms as governor.

According to a profile of Johnson in the ''[[National Review]]'', "During his tenure, he vetoed more bills than the other 49 governors combined<U+2014>750 in total, one third of which had been introduced by Republican legislators.
