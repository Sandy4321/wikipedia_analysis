'''''The Last Castle''''' is a 2001 [[drama film]] directed by [[Rod Lurie]], starring [[Robert Redford]] and [[James Gandolfini]]. The film portrays the struggle between inmates and the warden in a military prison called the Castle. Eugene Irwin (Redford), a [[Lieutenant General]] sentenced for insubordination, challenges the warden, [[Colonel]] Winter (Gandolfini), over his treatment of the prisoners. After mobilizing the inmates, Irwin leads an uprising aiming to seize control of the prison and remove Winter from command.

The film was released on October 19, 2001, in the United States, grossing about $28 million worldwide. The low gross of the film in comparison to its high production and marketing expenses led some to call it a [[box office bomb]]. It was not well received by mainstream critics and was seen as mediocre by general reviewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_castle/|title= The Last Castle|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[IGN Entertainment]]|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/lastcastle?q=the%20last%20castle|title=The Last Castle|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> ''The Last Castle'' won the [[Taurus World Stunt Awards|Taurus World Stunt Award]] for best fire [[stunt]] and was nominated for best aerial work and best stunt coordination sequence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taurusworldstuntawards.com/index.php?cmd=cmdPastNominees&year=2002|title=Nominees/ Winners 2002 Taurus World Stunt Awards|date=2002|publisher=[[Taurus World Stunt Awards]]|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref> [[Clifton Collins, Jr.]] was nominated for an [[ALMA Award]] in the "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture" category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2002/04/17/Nominees_for_2002_ALMA_Awards/UPI-18701019085817/|title=Nominees for 2002 ALMA Awards|date=2002-04-17|publisher=[[United Press International]]|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>

== Plot ==
General Eugene Irwin ([[Robert Redford]]) is sent to a maximum security [[military prison]] for his decision to send U.S. troops to [[Burundi]], [[Africa]] in violation of a presidential order resulting in the death of eight soldiers. Colonel Winter ([[James Gandolfini]]), the prison's warden, has a conflict with Irwin because of his way of changing the attitude of the prisoners. On one occasion, Irwin is punished harshly after stopping a guard from clubbing a prisoner, who was saluting him. Seeing the cruelty of the warden, Irwin attempts to unify the prisoners by building a "castle wall" of stone and mortar. Envying the respect earned by Irwin, Winter orders his guards to destroy the wall. Former Marine Corporal Ramon Aguilar ([[Clifton Collins, Jr.]]) takes a stand before the bulldozer, in an act of defiance. Winter orders a sharpshooter to fire a normally non-lethal [[rubber bullet]] directly into Aguilar's head, killing him. After the wall is destroyed, Irwin and the inmates pay final respects to Aguilar in formation. Winter later tries to make amends with Irwin, but Irwin calls him a disgrace to the uniform and demands his resignation.

Slowly, the prisoners resume a soldierly behavior, using code words and incomplete gestures, making Winter incapable of responding to indefinite activities. Winter reaches out to a prisoner named Yates ([[Mark Ruffalo]]) hoping that he would inform about Irwin's plans in exchange for a reduced sentence. Irwin organizes a plot to throw the prison into chaos by taking control of the facility. His intent is to show Brigadier General Wheeler ([[Delroy Lindo]]) (the warden's superior officer) that the warden is unfit and should be removed from his command under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. During General Wheeler's visit with Irwin, Winter receives a letter threatening the kidnapping of Wheeler by the prisoners. After ordering his men to take action, Winter realizes that the kidnapping was fake. Irwin tells his associates that the fake kidnapping was a way to detect how prison guards would react during an actual uprising. Yates becomes the key to their plan, tasked with taking over a [[Bell UH-1]] helicopter used powerfully by the guards during a riot.

Yates is later revealed to have stolen a flag that Winter prized, and soon after he is thrown into [[solitary confinement]], the uprising begins. Using improvised weapons and the tactics of a military unit, the prisoners capture an armored vehicle and the Bell helicopter. The prisoners call the general's headquarters and inform him of the riot. Winter regains control by threatening to use live ammunition against the prisoners. He knows from Yates that Irwin is planning to raise the American flag upside down, a distress signal. Winter orders his men to shoot as Irwin begins to hoist the flag up the pole. They refuse on the orders of Captain Peretz ([[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]]). The colonel proceeds to shoot Irwin himself and gets arrested by Peretz. The prisoners salute as they see that Irwin has actually raised the U.S. flag in the correct manner. It waves above the prison's walls as Winter is led away in handcuffs and the General's troops roll in with trucks.

== Production ==
[[File:TSP Main Entrance.jpg|thumb|180px|The castle-like appearance of the former Tennessee State Prison]]
The film was shot mainly at the 103-year-old former [[Tennessee State Prison]] in [[Davidson County, Tennessee]], which had previously been used for filming in ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' and ''[[Last Dance (film)|Last Dance]]'', and was chosen because of its [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] and castle-like appearance. The state of [[Tennessee]] offered to provide the location rent-free, with exemption from the state's 6&nbsp;percent state sales tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036713p1.html|title=The Castle Can Be Found in Tennessee|first=Stax|date=2001-01-11|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref> James Gandolfini earned $5&nbsp;million for co-starring in the movie after finishing the third season of ''[[The Sopranos]]'' in March 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036701p1.html|title=Yonda Lies The Castle of Tony Soprano| first=Stax| date=2001-01-08| publisher=IGN| accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

A crew of 150 worked on refurbishing existing buildings and constructing new buildings in a time limit of nine weeks. A wall {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} high was built, serving as the prison's entrance. A metal walkway and two towers were also built as vantage points for the guards. The movie required an office with a large window through which the warden could watch the inmates; this was constructed by the production crew. Director Rod Lurie insisted on having the prisoners' cells face each other, but this is not that case at the Tennessee State Prison. To solve the problem, production designer Kirk Petruccelli created cells in a warehouse near the prison.<ref name="Castle Walls">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastcastle.com/|title=Castle Walls|work=Behind the Scenes|publisher=DreamWorks|accessdate=2009-01-08}}</ref>

=== Cinematography ===
To show the balance of power, the film crew used multiple [[cinematography]] techniques involving different displays of color, lighting, camera and costumes. In the warden's office intense color was used to reflect freedom or power, in contrast to the washed-out colors from the less powerful yard. The contrasts shift as the story progresses, showing the increasing power of the prisoners. The American flag in the yard is described by Petruccelli as "the heart of The Castle" and is the only exemption to the washed-out color palette.<ref name="Castle Walls"/>

Cinematographer Shelly Johnson, in collaboration with Rod Lurie and the design team, also used lighting and camerawork to signify the shifting of powers. For example, the yard is at first naturally lit and more influenced by daylight, in contrast to Winter's office, which is artificially illuminated by lamps. As the film progresses, the office is more fully infiltrated by exterior light through a broken window. The shift of power is also emphasized through camera techniques. Hand-held cameras were used when filming in the yard to make the audience feel as if they were "participants in the action". However, a very precise, sterile camera composition was used in the warden's office. The prisoners' world gets more precise during the film, while the colonel's world is filmed more loosely.<ref name="Castle Walls"/>

Costume designer Ha Nguyen also demonstrates this contrast in the clothing of the cast. The film starts with the prisoners having their clothing divided by ethnicity, with African Americans wearing different headwear, Latinos wearing vests and various arm accessories, and the White Americans in cut-off t-shirts. After the arrival of General Irwin, the prisoners start wearing more similar clothing in a "sharp military manner". The uniforms of the prisoners change from the usual chocolate brown color to light grey, because of its muddled look on film and excessive darkness in some scenes. Ha Nguyen also contrasted the non-battlefield ribbons found on Colonel Winter's uniform with the battlefield medals found on General Irwin's uniform (seen only in the opening scene as Irwin is inducted into the prison).<ref name="Castle Walls"/>

The wall created by the prisoners in the middle of the yard also represents change and incarnation. What is at first a "discombobulated mess" representing the lack of unity among prisoners later becomes a perfect wall, a "powerful symbol of the results of [Irwin's] leadership".<ref name="Castle Walls"/>

===Effects===
Special effects supervisor [[Burt Dalton]] and stunt coordinator [[Mic Rodger]] created the battle weapons used in the final scenes. The [[trebuchet]], used by prisoners to throw rocks, was capable of throwing a {{convert|68|kg|lb|abbr=off}} rock a distance of {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off}} with an accuracy of ten feet around the target. The water canon had the power to shoot {{convert|76|L|USgal}} of water per second. Some of the cast did their own stunts, including Mark Ruffalo, who performed one scene hanging from a helicopter. Interiors of the helicopter were not created with blue screen effects; instead, a special [[gimbal]] was used to hold a full-sized [[UH-1 Iroquois|Huey-A]] type [[military helicopter]]. The gimbal was capable of rotating the helicopter 360&nbsp;degrees and vertically moving it 20&nbsp;feet. The gimbal was controlled by a computer, allowing Dalton to precisely set speed and movement; this ensured precise repeatability for multiple takes.<ref name="Castle Breach">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelastcastle.com/|title=The Castle Breach|work=Behind the Scenes|publisher=DreamWorks|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

=== Reviews ===
Mick LaSalle from the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' criticized the choice of the main cast, describing Robert Redford as "no [[George C. Scott]]" and Gandolfini as too big to play an icy intellectual. He wrote that the struggle between good and evil displayed by the characters was an illusion and that "one has to assume that the filmmakers know it". LaSalle concluded that it was a "naive film about a great leader's capacity to inspire".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/10/19/DD100439.DTL&type=movies|title=Complex 'Castle' a morality tale|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''|date=2001-10-19|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> Roger Ebert from the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' saw the story as "a dramatic, involving story", but criticized its "loopholes and lapses". Ebert criticized the incarnation of good and evil in the characters of Irwin and Winter. He noted that Irwin is no less evil than Winter and that they both "delight in manipulating those they can control". The difference is that Irwin is "better at masking his puppet-mastery in nobility". Ebert also criticized the character of Gen. Wheeler, who "makes his decisions entirely for the convenience of the plot". He noted that the film doesn't portray how the prisoners manufacture the weapons and hide them under Winter's observation. Ebert concluded that "the immediate experience of watching ''The Last Castle'' is strongly involving, and the action at the end, exciting", and gave the film three stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011019/REVIEWS/110190304/1023|title=The Last Castle |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=2001-10-19|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> It received 3 out of 5 stars on [[IGN]]; the review noted that though a solid, well paced and well acted film, it "suffers from this overall militaristic, streamlined approach".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/307/307433p1.html|title=Review of The Last Castle|last=D.|first=Spence |date=2001-10-19|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2009-01-07}}</ref>

Kenneth Turan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized the film, saying "''The Last Castle''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s pretensions lead to a slow, even stately pace, what should be crackling confrontations between Irwin and Winter end up playing more like a tea party than a Wagnerian battle of wills".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie000083193oct19,0,6376491.story|title='The Last Castle' Flies the Flag|last=Turan|first=Kenneth |date=2001-10-19|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> Owen Gleiberman of the ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the movie a "C+", saying "Yet as staged by Lurie, the drama has all the subtlety and surprise of a showdown between the sissy-bully son of Captain Queeg and a hero who's like a fusion of Brubaker, Spartacus, and Norma Rae".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,180128~1~0~lastcastle,00.html|title=The Last Castle|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' criticized the film saying "Much of the potential dramatic juice has been drained out of "The Last Castle," a disappointingly pedestrian prison meller that falls between stools artistically and politically".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117916134.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=The Last Castle|last=Mccarthy|first=Todd|date=2001-10-19|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' criticized the writing, saying that the prisoners were fighting "a losing battle with an implausible script".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2001-10-19-the-last-castle-review.htm|title=Redford cannot protect 'Last Castle'|last=Puig|first=Claudia |date=2001-10-18|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref> Elvis Mitchell of the ''[[New York Times]]'' said that "the movie is exuberant, strapping and obvious&mdash;a problem drama suffering from a steroid overdose".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9503EEDF123EF93AA25753C1A9679C8B63|title=Manning the Ramparts for Old Glory |last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|date=2001-10-19|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=2009-03-09}}</ref>
