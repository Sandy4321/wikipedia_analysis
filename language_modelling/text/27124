'''''The Only Solution''''' is [[Cold 187um]]'s first release on [[Psychopathic Records]]. It is considered to be a "deluxe [[mixtape]]" and a [[concept album]].<ref name=Fontana/>

== Background ==
After signing Cold 187um, [[Psychopathic Records]] wanted to develop an album that would combine the talents of Cold 187um and Psychopathic in a way that would appeal to [[Juggalo]]s, the label's fanbase, and establish the rapper to that audience, as he was well known for his efforts in [[gangsta rap]], but not previously established to Juggalos.<ref>http://blogs.metrotimes.com/index.php/2012/10/city-slang-psychopathic-prepare-to-unleash-cold-187um/</ref> Cold 187um and [[Joseph Bruce]] developed the concept for the album, which tells the story of a assassin as he develops from a young boy into a hired killer,<ref name=faygoluvers/> the "Psychopathic Assassin", who is hired by [[Psychopathic Records]] whenever someone "needs to be taken care of".<ref name=Fontana>http://www.ingroovesfontana.com/new-releases/cd-vinyl/10-2-&-10-9-INgF-NR-Book.pdf</ref>

The album features Cold 187um rapping over beats previously released on other Psychopathic albums, including [[Twiztid]]'s "So High", ICP<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Chicken Huntin']]<U+201D> and [[Dark Lotus]] songs.<ref name=faygoluvers/><ref name=Fontana/> It is prepackaged with a [[comic book]] that corresponds with the album.<ref name=faygoluvers/><ref name=Fontana/>

== Release and promotion ==

A panflet included with [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s album ''[[The Mighty Death Pop!]]'' listed the release date of ''The Only Solution'' as October 9, 2012. However, the album was pushed back to October 22 to coincide with the release of Twiztid's album ''[[Abominationz]]''.<ref name=faygoluvers>{{cite web|author=Like |url=http://vimeo.com/38710769 |title=Big Hutch Interview - 3/9/12 on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref>

Psychopathic's [[YouTube]] channel released a series of videos entitled "In the mind of an Assassin", as well as a [[music video]] featuring Cold 187um rapping over the beat from ICP's cover of the [[Geto Boys]]' "Assassins", to promote the release of ''The Only Solution''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJL8OBbkjnI |title=Cold 187 - The Psychopathic Assassin |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-12-22 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsZFK6850UU</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Njxx5pRN-d8</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZlO-Pukxzk</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-wvp_priU</ref> The videos depicted Cold 187um in character as the "Psychopathic Assassin", preparing and performing staged assasinations.
