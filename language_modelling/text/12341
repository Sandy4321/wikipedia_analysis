Rabbi '''Shmuel (HaLevi) Wosner''' is a prominent [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] [[rabbi]] and [[posek]] ("decisor of [[Halakha|Jewish law]]") living in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]. 

Rabbi Wosner was born in 1913 in Vienna, Austria and he learned at the famous [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva|Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin]] lead by Rabbi [[Meir Shapiro]] and he was also a student of Rabbi Shimon of Zelicov who was the official supervisor and caretaker at the Yeshiva. In [[Vienna]], he had known and befriended the late Rabbi [[Chanoch Dov Padwa]]. He married and immigrated to Israel before the Holocaust, and dwelled in Jerusalem where he studied at the [[Dushinsky]] Yeshiva. It was in that time that, in spite of his young age, he became a member of the [[Edah HaChareidis]].

He is the author of several works of [[halakha|Jewish law]], such as ''Shevet HaLevi'' ("The Tribe of Levi"), a comprehensive series of Halachic rulings on Jewish laws comprising of ten volumes and several other Torah books all bearing the same name.

His sons include Rabbi [[Chaim Wosner]], [[dayan]] of [[London]]'s Satmar community, who serves as a judge in the [[beth din]] of London's [[UOHC|chareidi community]] to hear cases involving financial disputes.
