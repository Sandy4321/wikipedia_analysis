The '''140th Ohio Volunteer Infantry''' (or '''140th OVI''') was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Service==
The 140th Ohio Infantry was organized in [[Gallipolis, Ohio]] and mustered in May 10, 1864 for 100 days service under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Robert B. Wilson.

The regiment left Ohio for [[Charleston, West Virginia]], May 10. Assigned to duty as garrison at Charleston and on guard duty along the Kanawha and Gauley Rivers until September. 

The 140th Ohio Infantry mustered out of service September 3, 1864 at Gallipolis.

==Ohio National Guard==
Over 35,000 Ohio National Guardsmen were federalized and organized into regiments for [[Hundred Days Men|100 days service]] in May 1864. Shipped to the Eastern Theater, they were designed to be placed in "safe" rear areas to protect railroads and supply points, thereby freeing regular troops for Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]<U+2019>s push on the [[Confederate]] capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. As events transpired, many units found themselves in combat, stationed in the path of Confederate Gen. [[Jubal Early]]<U+2019>s veteran [[Army of the Valley]] during its famed [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Ohio Guard units met the battle-tested foe head on and helped blunt the Confederate offensive thereby saving [[Washington, D.C.]] from capture. Ohio National Guard units participated in the battles of [[Battle of Monocacy|Monacacy]], [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]], [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Harpers Ferry]], and in the [[siege of Petersburg]].

==Casualties==
The regiment lost 2 enlisted men during service, both due to disease.
