'''Warren Wallace Beckwith''' (August 10, 1874 <U+2013> September 24, 1955) was a historical figure and part of the [[Lincoln family tree|Lincoln family]], having been married to President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s granddaughter [[Jessie Harlan Lincoln]]. He is the father of the last undisputed direct Lincoln descendant, [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]]. Beckwith was also a [[minor league baseball]] player during the late 1800s. 

==Early life==
Beckwith was born in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], Iowa, on August 10, 1874. His father was Capt. Warren Beckwith of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, who worked as general roadmaster of the [[Burlington Northern Railroad|Burlington railroad]]. Capt. Beckwith first married Luzenia Porter. When she died, he married her sister Sarah Porter. Warren was the youngest of Capt. Warren's five children. Being a "wealthy railroad executive", Capt. Beckwith left his son an inheritance upon his death.<ref name=baseballdaily1>{{cite web|title=Abe Lincoln and Baseball|url=http://baseballhistorydaily.com/tag/warren-wallace-beckwith/|website=BASEBALL HISTORY DAILY|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The Beckwiths were considered a "distinguished family."<ref name=Lachman1>{{cite book|last1=Lachman|first1=Charles|title=The Last Lincolns: The Rise and Fall of a Great American Family|date=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=9781402758904|page=460|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XAPBW7nyZEIC&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=Warren+Wallace+Beckwith&source=bl&ots=T0fuI7X3ND&sig=gsdbuXjuVA1vaFqOxaE4Mz_JBmw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mcAIVIjFNMiIjALK1oHIBA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Warren%20Wallace%20Beckwith&f=false|accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> 

==Marriage with Jessie Harlan Lincoln==
Beckwith met Jessie Harlan Lincoln in Mount Pleasant, Beckwith being a friend of the Lincoln family.<ref name=milwaukee1>{{cite book|title=Milwaukee, Volume 12|date=1967|publisher=Schmidt Publications|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> Knowing that her family did not approve of the match, Jessie and Beckwith eloped and married on November 10, 1897. At the time, Beckwith was playing college football, and it was considered unseemly to marry a footballer.<ref name=Neely1>{{cite book|last1=Neely|first1=Mark A.|title=The Abraham Lincoln encyclopedia|date=1982|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=82|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> Jessie had told her mother that she was going shopping with friends, and instead rendezvoused with Beckwith to travel to Milwaukee and get married.<ref>Lachman, p.324.</ref>
[[Image:Mary Lincoln Beckwith young.jpg|thumb|left|Beckwith's daughter [[Mary Lincoln Beckwith|Mary "Peggy" Lincoln Beckwith]] at age 14.]]
The marriage was performed by Pastor Orlando P. Christian. The two required witnesses were Mrs. Christian, the pastor's wife, and the Pastor's neighbor, Mrs. Henry J. Baumgaertner. It was the first time that Christian had performed an elopement ceremony, though he was not aware that it was an elopement until after the ceremony had been performed.<ref>Lachman, p.325.</ref> The marriage made [[The New York Times]], with a headline that read "[[Robert Todd Lincoln|R.T. LINCOLN]]<U+2019>S DAUGHTER WEDS; Marries an Iowa Man to Whom Her Parents Objected".<ref name=fenway1>{{cite web|title=Round up: Base Ball, Abe Lincoln, Johnny & The Sox|url=http://athomeatfenway.wordpress.com/2011/09/28/round-up-base-ball-abe-lincoln-johnny-the-sox/|website=At Home At Fenway|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>

After getting married, the two relocated to Chicago and Beckwith secured a job at the [[Peoples Energy|Chicago Light Gas & Coke Company]].<ref>Lachman, p.332.</ref> Two children resulted from the marriage in the following years. On August 22, 1898, she gave birth to her first child, [[Mary Lincoln Beckwith]], in Iowa. On July 19, 1904, Jessie had [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], named after her father.

Beckwith and wife Jessie separated at least two times because of martial issues. In January of 1905, Jessie took their two children to visit family without Beckwith. After months of arguments over the telephone, Jessie moved from their Riverside home. She moved her belongings in the Harlan home on Mount Pleasant and then moved in with her parents on [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, taking her children with her. When Jessie took the children to Europe, Beckwith filed divorce papers on January 31, 1907. He claimed desertion, and the divorce was granted. Jessie was granted custody of their children, and Beckwith never saw his children again.<ref name=Emerson1>{{cite book|last1=Emerson|first1=Jason|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T. Lincoln|date=2012|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=9780809390717|page=363|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tPqgC3RS-7sC&pg=PA363&dq=Jessie+Harlan+Lincoln+children&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lhsJVLrnI8P5iwK4tIEo&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Jessie%20Harlan%20Lincoln%20children&f=false|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>

==Sports==
===Football===
Beckwith played football on the [[Iowa Wesleyan College]] team, which he was signed to when he got married. After his marriage to Jessie, The New York Times covered his very next game, that being the [[Iowa Wesleyan Tigers]] versus the Keokuk College of Physicians and Surgeons (a now defunct college). The Tigers won the game 48-0.<ref>Lachman, p.332.</ref>

===Baseball===
Beckwith played for a number of minor league baseball teams:<ref name=baseballreference1>{{cite web|title=Warren Beckwith|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=beckwi001war|website=Baseball Reference|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref>

In 1905, Beckwith managed the Oshkosh Indians of the [[Wisconsin State League]] from [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]] for one season. They were a D level team.<ref name=baseballreference1 />

When Jessie was four months pregnant, Beckwith tried out for and was signed to the pro baseball team in [[Ottumwa]], Iowa, in March 1898. Sarah, Beckwith's stepmother (and aunt), went to the team manager and convinced him to release Beckwith out of his contract so he could find more suitable employment.<ref>Lachman, p.333.</ref>

During his baseball tenure, Beckwith was known as "the dude" and "the lady killer".<ref name=Fatsis1>{{cite news|last1=Fatsis|first1=Stefan|title=Hang Up and Listen: The Worth Its Wait in Gold Edition|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/hang_up_and_listen/2012/12/johnny_manziel_heisman_trophy_hang_up_and_listen_on_texas_a_m_s_freshman.html|accessdate=5 September 2014|publisher=Slate}}</ref>

==Later life==
After divorcing Jessie, Beckwith married Blanche Cutter. After the marriage with Cutter ended, Beckwith then went on to marry Vera Ward. Ward was an [[Ashville, North Carolina|Ashville]] [[silent film]] actress, and the two married in 1924. Together they had son Warren Wallace Beckwith, Jr., who became an oceanographer and worked at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].<ref name=Lachman1>{{cite book|last1=Lachman|first1=Charles|title=The Last Lincolns: The Rise and Fall of a Great American Family|date=2008|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|isbn=9781402758904|page=387|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XAPBW7nyZEIC&pg=PA387&dq=Warren+Wallace+Beckwith&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_bi6U4_yKYf3oATp-YH4Bw&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Warren%20Wallace%20Beckwith&f=false|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref>

Beckwith moved to [[La Jolla, California|La Jolla]] California in 1938, where he spent his time hunting and golfing.<ref name=financialfoundation1>{{cite book|title=The Lincoln Grandchildren|publisher=Lincoln Financial Foundation Collection|url=https://archive.org/stream/lincolngrandchillinc_1/lincolngrandchillinc_1_djvu.txt|accessdate=5 September 2014}}</ref> He died there on September 24, 1955.
