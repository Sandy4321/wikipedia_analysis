'''John Anthony Frusciante''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA pronunciation]]: {{IPA|[f<U+0279>u<U+02C8><U+0283><U+0251>nte<U+026A>]}}) (born [[March 5]], [[1970]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[guitarist]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]]. He is the guitarist for the [[alternative rock]] band [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], with whom he has recorded five studio albums. Frusciante also maintains an active solo career, having released nine albums under his own name, as well as collaborations with [[Josh Klinghoffer]] and [[Joe Lally]] under the name [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]]. His solo recordings incorporate a variety of elements ranging from [[experimental rock]] and [[ambient music]] to [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[electronica]]. Drawing influence from guitarists of various genres, Frusciante emphasizes melody and emotion in his guitar-playing, and favors vintage guitars and analog recording techniques. 

Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers at the age of 18, first appearing on record on the band's 1989 album ''[[Mother's Milk]]''. The group's follow-up album, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'', was a breakthrough success. However, he was overwhelmed by the band's newfound popularity and as a result quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered a long period of [[heroin]] addiction, during which he released his first recordings: ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'' (1994) and ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' (1997). In 1998 Frusciante successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Chili Peppers for their 1999 album ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]''. Since then he has continued to record with the band and has received critical recognition for his guitar-playing, having ranked eighteenth on ''[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone's]]'' list of  "[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]]" in 2003.<ref name="rs100">{{cite news | title = The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time/ | date = [[August 27]], [[2003]] | publisher = ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |accessdate=2007-08-27 }}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Frusciante was born in [[Queens, New York|Queens]], [[New York]] on [[March 5]], [[1970]]. His father, John Sr., was a [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]-trained pianist, and his mother Gail, was a promising vocalist who gave up her career to be a stay-at-home mother.<ref name="gpm1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#guitarPlayer01|author=Rotondigic, James|date=November 1997|title="Till I Reach the Higher Ground"|accessdate=2007-08-31|publisher=''Guitar Player''}}</ref> Frusciante's family relocated to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Arizona]], and then [[Florida]], where his father still serves as a [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] judge. His parents separated, and he and his mother subsequently moved to [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]].<ref name="gpm1"/>

A year later, Frusciante and his mother moved to [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California|Mar Vista]], [[Los Angeles]] with his new stepfather who, according to Frusciante, "really supported me and made me feel good about being an artist."<ref name="gpm1"/> Like many youth in the area, he became involved in the L.A. [[punk rock]] scene. At age nine he became fixated on [[The Germs]], wearing out several copies of their album ''[[(GI)]]''. By age ten he had taught himself how to play most of ''(GI)'s'' songs in a tuning that allowed him to play every chord with a single-finger barre.<ref name="gpm1"/> Soon after, Frusciante began taking guitar lessons from a player who introduced him to the music of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<ref name="Kramer">{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#inter03|author=Kramer, Dan|title= "John Frusciante talks to Dan Kramer"|accessdate=2007-08-31|publisher=''Johnfrusciante.com''}}</ref>

Frusciante began studying guitarists like [[Jeff Beck]], [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] at the age of eleven. After mastering the [[Hexatonic scale|blues scale]], he discovered [[Frank Zappa]], whose work he would study for hours.<ref name="gpm1"/> Frusciante dropped out of high school at the age of sixteen with authorization from his parents and completion of a proficiency test. With their support, he moved to Los Angeles on his own in order to focus on sharpening his musical skills.<ref name="rs-fricke">Fricke, David. ([[June 15]], [[2006]]).

===1988<U+2013>1992: Red Hot Chili Peppers===
{{main|Red Hot Chili Peppers}}
Frusciante first saw the Red Hot Chili Peppers in concert when he was fifteen and became a devoted fan.<ref name="rs-fricke"/> He idolized guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]], and studied and learned virtually all the guitar and bass parts from the Chili Peppers' first three albums. Frusciante became acquainted with Slovak by frequenting Chili Peppers shows; they spoke at the last show Frusciante attended before joining the group:<ref name=raw1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#raw01|author=Nelson, Artie|date=November 23, 1994|title="Space Cadet"|accessdate=2007-08-31|publisher=''Raw Magazine'', Issue #163}}</ref>
{{cquote|...Hillel asked me, 'Would you still like the Chilis if they got so popular they played the [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|LA Forum]] [a large venue where mainstream acts play]?' I said, 'No. It would ruin the whole thing. That's great about the band, the audience feels no different from the band at all.' There was this real kind of historical vibe at their shows, none of the frustration that runs through the audience when they jump around and can't get out of their seat. I didn't even watch the shows. I'd get so excited that I'd flip around the slam pit the whole time. I really felt like a part of the band, and all the sensitive people in the audience did too.}}

Frusciante became friends with former [[Dead Kennedys]] drummer [[D. H. Peligro]] in early 1988. They jammed together on numerous occasions, and Peligro invited his friend [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to jam with them. Frusciante and Flea developed a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later saying that might have been the day he first played the bass riff to "[[Nobody Weird Like Me]]".<ref>''Mother's Milk'' reissue liner notes</ref> Around the same time, Frusciante was going to audition for Frank Zappa's musical congregation, but abandoned any such ideas before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use among musicians in his band. In an interview Frusciante said, "I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band."<ref name="gpm1"/>

Slovak died of a heroin overdose in 1988, and Chili Peppers drummer [[Jack Irons]], who was incapable of coping with Slovak's death, left the group. Remaining members Flea and singer [[Anthony Kiedis]] regrouped, determined to persevere in the music industry. The band added Peligro on drums and [[DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight]], formerly of [[Parliament-Funkadelic|P-Funk]], on guitar.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 234</ref> McKnight, however, was failing to spark any chemistry within the group. Flea proposed auditioning Frusciante, whose intimate knowledge of the Chili Peppers' repertoire astonished him. Flea and Kiedis auditioned Frusciante for the band and agreed that he would be a suitable replacement for McKnight, who was promptly fired.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 239</ref> When Flea called Frusciante with the news of his acceptance into the Chili Peppers, Frusciante was so excited that he ran through his house, jumped up a wall and left permanent boot marks there.<ref name=vh1btm>{{cite episode | title = [http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51363/episode_about.jhtml Red Hot Chili Peppers] | series = [[Behind the Music]] | network = [[VH1]] | airdate = 1999-05-30 | accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> He was about to sign a contract with [[Thelonious Monster]] at the time (and had actually been playing with them for two weeks), but his unanticipated reception into the Chili Peppers prompted him to change his plans.<ref name=GuitarMag1>Forsythe, Tom.

A few weeks into the band's new lineup, Peligro, whose performance was suffering due to extreme drug abuse, was fired from the band.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 242</ref> Soon after, [[Chad Smith]] was added as the group's new drummer and the new lineup began recording their first album, 1989's ''[[Mother's Milk]]''. During recording, Frusciante wanted to focus his playing on emulating Slovak's signature style, rather than imposing his own personal style on the group. Producer [[Michael Beinhorn]] disagreed, and wanted Frusciante to play with an uncharacteristic [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] tone.<ref name=p.249>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 249</ref> Frusciante and Beinhorn frequently fought over guitar tone and layering, and Beinhorn's view ultimately won out.<ref name=p.249/>

The Chili Peppers collaborated with producer [[Rick Rubin]] for their second record with Frusciante, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]''. Rubin felt that it was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, and the band agreed.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 284</ref> Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves in the mansion for the duration of recording. Smith however, felt the mansion was haunted and refused to live there.<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 285</ref> For the duration of recording, Frusciante and Flea made few ventures into society, spending most of their time consuming significant amounts of [[marijuana]].<ref name="tgm2002">Dalley, Helen (August 2002). "John Frusciante" ''Total Guitar''. Retrieved on [[August 27]], [[2007]].</ref> Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and [[Jane's Addiction]] drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, though none of it has ever been released.<ref name=raw1/>

''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' was a huge hit upon its release on [[September 24]], [[1991]]. The album peaked at #3 on the ''Billboard'' charts, and eventually sold over seven million copies in the U.S. alone.<ref> [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&model.vnuArtistId=5507&model.vnuAlbumId=815996 Billboard 200] Billboard.com.

Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled in his memoir that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'"<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 229</ref> Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was "too high, too far, too soon.

===1992<U+2013>1997: Drug addiction===
Frusciante developed serious drug habits as a result of touring with the band during the previous four years. He said that when he "found out that Flea was stoned out of his mind at every show, that inspired me to be a pothead."<ref name=hightimes> Kennealy, Tim. (July 1995) [http://www.johnfrusciante.com/articles.php#highTimes01 Chilly Pepper]. ''High Times''. Retrieved on [[2007-07-07]]</ref> Not only was Frusciante smoking large amounts of marijuana, he began using heroin and was on the verge of full-scale addiction. He went back to his home in California and fell into a deep state of [[depression (mood)|depression]]; feeling that his life was over, and that he could no longer write music or play guitar.<ref name="selvaggio"/> For a long period of  time, he focused primarily on painting and producing 4-track recordings he had made during the time he spent recording ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. To cope with his worsening depression, Frusciante dramatically increased his heroin use to a state of abuse; and subsequently spiraled into a life-threatening dependency.<ref name=rsm1/> According to Frusciante, his use of heroin to medicate his depression was a clear decision: "I was very sad, and I was always happy when I was on drugs; therefore, I should be on drugs all the time. I was never guilty<U+2014>I was always really proud to be an addict."<ref> Sullivan, Kate. "Interview with Flea, Anthony and John". ''Spin'' (August 2002). Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[06-22]]</ref>

Frusciante released his first solo album ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'', on [[March 8]], [[1994]]. The majority of the tracks on the album were recorded while he was strung out on heroin in his Hollywood apartment.<ref name=jfcom-niandra>{{cite web|author=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/niandra.php|title=''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt''|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> The effect drug use had on the album's sound is exemplified on its tenth track, "Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire". ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' was partly recorded during the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' sessions, and was released on Rubin's label [[American Recordings]]. [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], the Chili Peppers' label, had rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was living as a recluse, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urgings of Frusciante's friends.<ref name="pnt"/>

By Frusciante's own admission, the album was released in order to get "drug money", and it was withdrawn from the market at his request in 1999.<ref name=jfcom-sm>{{cite web|author=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/smile.php|title=''Smile from the Streets You Hold''|accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref> Although his initial motives for releasing the album were ignoble, Frusciante has stated that he likes the album and has promised to one day re-release it.<ref>{{cite web|author=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/news.php|title="A Little Message from John to the Fans"|date=[[March 16]], [[2005]]|accessdate=2006-06-08}}</ref>

===1997<U+2013>2002: Rehabilitation and return to the Chili Peppers===
In late 1997, after more than five years of addiction to the drug, Frusciante quit using heroin [[cold turkey]].<ref name=p.407>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 407</ref> However, months later he was still unable to break addictions to [[crack cocaine]] and alcohol.<ref name=p.407/> In January of 1998, upon the urgings of longtime friend [[Bob Forrest]], Frusciante checked himself into Las Encinas, a [[drug rehabilitation]] clinic in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] to begin a full recovery.<ref name=p.407/> Upon his arrival at the clinic, he was diagnosed with a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his teeth and replacing them with dentures.<ref name=gpm1/> He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms.<ref name="papermag"/> About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and reentered society.<ref name=p.408>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 408</ref>

Fully recovered and once again healthy, Frusciante began living a more spiritual, [[asceticism|ascetic]] lifestyle. He changed his diet, becoming more health-conscious and eating mostly unprocessed foods.<ref name=selvaggio/> Through regular practice of [[vipassana]] and yoga, he discovered the effect self-discipline has on the body.<ref name=DiPerna/> To maintain his increased spiritual awareness and reduce distraction from his music, Frusciante decided to abstain from sexual activity stating: "I'm very well without it".<ref name="selvaggio"/> All of these changes in his life have led him to a complete change in his attitude toward drugs:<ref name=rsm1>"Water Music".

{{cquote|I don't need to take drugs.

It's such a beautiful thing to be able to face life, to face yourself, without hiding behind drugs; without having to have anger towards people who love you. There are people who are scared of losing stuff, but you don't lose anything for any other reason than if you just give up on yourself.}}
Despite his experience as an addict, Frusciante does not view his drug use as a "dark period" in his life. He has said that he values the period as a time when found himself and got his mind straight with everything he needed to know.<ref name=kerrang1>Bryant, Tom. ([[May 3]], [[2006]]) "War Ensemble." ''Kerrang!''.</ref> Frusciante has since stopped practicing yoga, due to negative effects it was having on his back, but he still tries to meditate daily.<ref name=DiPerna/>

In early 1998 the Red Hot Chili Peppers fired guitarist [[Dave Navarro]] and were on the verge of a breakup. Flea told Kiedis, "the only way I could imagine carrying on [with the Chili Peppers] is if we got John back in the band."<ref>Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. p. 404</ref> With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. When Flea went over to Frusciante's house and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante started sobbing and said "nothing would make me happier in the world."<ref name=p.408/>

With Frusciante back on guitar, the Chili Peppers began recording their next album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'', which was released in 1999. Frusciante's return restored a key component of the Chili Peppers' sound, as well as a healthy morale. He brought with him his deep devotion to music when he returned, which had a significant impact on the band's recording style during the album.<ref name=tgm2002/> Frusciante has frequently stated that his work on ''Californication'' is his favorite.<ref name=tgm2002/>

During the ''Californication'' world tour, Frusciante continued to write his own songs, many of which would be released in 2001 on his third solo album ''[[To Record Only Water for Ten Days]]''. The album was dissimilar to his preceding records in that it wasn't as markedly [[Stream of consciousness writing|stream-of-consciousness]] or [[avant-garde]]. However, the album's lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down.<ref name=Chonin>{{Cite web| title=''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' review |author=Chonin, Neva|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johnfrusciante/albums/album/103023/review/5942707/to_record_only_water_for_ten_days|date=[[February 5]], [[2001]]|publisher = ''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> The songwriting and production of ''To Record Only Water for Ten Days'' were more efficient and straight-forward than on his previous recordings.<ref name=Chonin/> The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on ''Californication'', focusing more on [[electronica|electronic]] and [[New Wave music|New Wave]] elements.<ref name=TROWFTD>{{cite web|author=Johnfrusciante.com|url=http://www.johnfrusciante.com/music/ten_days.php|title=''To Record only Water for Ten Days''|date=[[February 13]], [[2001]]|accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> Instead of focusing mostly on his guitar work, Frusciante focused more on synthesizers, which are a distinctive feature of this record.<ref name=TROWFTD/>

In 2001, Frusciante began recording his fourth album with the Chili Peppers, ''[[By the Way]]''; a time that he considers to be among the happiest of his life.<ref name=tgm2002/> He relished the chance the album gave him to "keep writing better songs".<ref name=tgm2002/> His goal to improve his guitar playing on the album was largely driven by a desire to emulate guitar players such as [[Andy Partridge]], [[Johnny Marr]] and [[John McGeoch]]; or as he put it, "people who used good chords."<ref name=tgm2002/> The album marked Frusciante's shift to a more group-minded mentality within the Chili Peppers, viewing the band as a cohesive unit rather than as four separate entities.<ref name=tgm2002/> ''By the Way'' was released in the U.S. on [[July 9]], [[2002]].

===2002<U+2013>present: 2004 recordings and ''Stadium Arcadium''===
Frusciante wrote and recorded a plethora of songs during and after the ''By the Way'' tour. In February 2004, he started a side project with [[Joe Lally]] of [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]] and [[Josh Klinghoffer]], called [[Ataxia (band)|Ataxia]].

Frusciante released his fourth full-length solo album ''[[Shadows Collide with People]]'' on [[February 24]], [[2004]]. The album featured guest appearances from some of his friends, including Klinghoffer, and Chili Peppers bandmates Smith and Flea.<ref>''Shadows Collide with People'' liner notes</ref> In June of 2004, Frusciante announced that he would be releasing six records over the span of six months:<ref name=rstone2004>Devenish, Colin.

[[Image:John Frusciante 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Frusciante at [[Madejski Stadium]] in Reading England in July 2006.]] In early 2005, Frusciante entered the studio to work on his fifth studio album with the Chili Peppers, ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]''. His guitar playing is dominant throughout the album, and he provides backing vocals on the majority of the tracks, as well.

==Musical style==
{{quote box|quote=When the intellectual part of guitar playing overrides the spiritual, you don't get to extreme heights.|source=John Frusciante (''Rolling Stone'', 2007)<ref name=fricke>Fricke, David.

Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[06-12]]</ref>|width=310px}}Frusciante's musical style has evolved significantly throughout his years of playing. Although he has received moderate recognition for his guitar work in the past, it was not until ''Stadium Arcadium'' that music critics and guitarists alike started to recognize his work.<ref name=fricke/> Frusciante attributes this to his shift in focus, stating that on the album he chose an approach based on rhythmic patterns which were inspired by the complexity of material Hendrix and [[Eddie Van Halen]] produced.<ref name=interview2006>{{cite video|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=g9E8livzmRM|year=2006|people = Gallori, Paolo|title=Intervista a John Frusciante|publisher=You Tube|medium=TV interview|accessdate=2007-08-10 }}</ref> On preceding records, however, he centered much of his output around the influence of various underground punk and New Wave musicians.<ref name="tgm2002"/> In general, his sound is also defined by his affinity for vintage guitars. All the guitars that he owns, records, and tours with were crafted prior to 1970.<ref name=cantstopmaking>Making of "Can't Stop" music video. Red Hot Chili Peppers ''Greatest Hits''.</ref> Frusciante will use a designated guitar for the song he finds it suits best. His most frequently used instrument of recent times is a 1962 Sunburst [[Fender Stratocaster]] which he has used on every album since returning to the Chili Peppers, and their ensuing tours.<ref name=guitarx>"Interview with John Frusciante." ''Guitar Xtreme''. (June 2006).</ref> Frusciante's most prized intstrument is a 1955 [[Gretsch White Falcon]], which he used twice per show during the ''By the Way'' tour. He has since removed the White Falcon from his repertoire, feeling there was "no room for it."<ref name=guitarx/>

Frusciante uses a variety of vocal styles on his solo albums, ranging from the distressed screeches heard on ''Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt'' and ''Smile from the Streets You Hold'', to more conventional styles on subsequent records.<ref name=stylusSCWP>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=1748&PHPSESSID=575b6a2a9b7d580e58a060316e0673f1|author=McKeating, Scott|title=''Shadows Collide With People'' Album Review|date=[[February 23]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-08-27|publisher=''Stylus Magazine''}}</ref> With the Chili Peppers, Frusciante provides backing vocals in a [[falsetto]] tenor, a style he established on ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. He thoroughly enjoys his role in the Chili Peppers as backup singer, and feels that backing vocals are a "real art form".<ref name=radio>{{Cite web|url=http://www.locborg.de/fru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid=124|author=|title=Radio interview|date=[[April 3]], [[2004]]|accessdate=2007-09-02|publisher=}}</ref> Despite his commitment to the Chili Peppers, he feels very strongly that his solo material and his contributions to the band should remain separate. When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1999, Kiedis wanted the band to record "Living in Hell", a song Frusciante had written several years prior. Frusciante rejected the request, feeling that the creative freedom he needs for his solo projects could conflict with his role in the band.<ref name=radio/>

===Technique===
Frusciante's guitar playing is largely centered on melody and emotion, rather than virtuosity. Although certain elements of his virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often downplays this as much as possible.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; p. 76<U+2013>82</ref> He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade to remain unsurpassed.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists chose to focus on speed. Because of this, he feels that the skills of many defiant New Wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name="tgm2002"/> It is for this reason that Frusciante chooses to accentuate the melodically-driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible. He feels that their style has not been fully developed as a result of being overlooked, and therefore chooses to draw heavily from their technique.<ref name="tgm2002"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s."<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on "clean tones" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a "grimy" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to "mistreat" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many "stylistic boundaries" as he can, in order to expand his musical horizons. Frusciante considers much of the output from today's guitarists to lack originality, and that many of his contemporaries "follow the rules with no risk."<ref name=Kerrangspain/>

Over the years, Frusciante's approach to album composition changed. On his early recordings, he allowed and welcomed imperfections to enter the sound, noting that "even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars".<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on subsequent albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he sought the opposite aesthetic: "I just wanted everything to be perfect<U+2014>I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that."<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=15850|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|accessdate=2007-08-27|publisher=''Guitar Player''}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as a progressive development, which he does not force upon himself: "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it."<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is initially written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan. "Basic Instinct." ''Guitar World Acoustic''. (April 2005).</ref> Frusciante cultivates an atmosphere conducive to songwriting by constantly listening to the music of others and absorbing its creative influence.<ref name=Austin>Hernandez, Raoul. "Me and My Friends." ''Austin Chronicle''. ([[November 28]], [[2004]]).</ref> He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes, and other relatively primitive equipment.<ref name=electronic>Tingen, Paul. "John Frusciante's Creative Explosion." ''Electronic Musician''. (July 2004)</ref> This preference stems from his belief that the use of older equipment can actually serve to speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.<ref name=law1/> Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he feels that "music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly, they often get frustrated, or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/>

===Influences===
Although Slovak, Hendrix and Zappa were arguably Frusciante's biggest influences prior to joining the Chili Peppers, some of his other early influences include avant-garde acts like [[Captain Beefheart]], [[The Residents]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Neu!]] and [[Kraftwerk]].<ref name=gpm1/><ref name="Kramer"/> Frusciante credits his inspiration for learning guitar to [[Greg Ginn]], [[Pat Smear]] and [[Joe Strummer]], among others.<ref name=fricke/> Heading into his adolescent years, he began focusing on Hendrix and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as lesser known bands like [[Public Image Ltd.]], [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]] and [[The Smiths]].<ref name="Kramer"/><ref name="tgm2002"/> Frusciante likes the acoustic one-man blues of [[Leadbelly]] and [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], and the two were a notable influence on him during the recording of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''.<ref>Mitchell, Ed. "Robert Johnson - King of the Delta Blues Singers". ''Total Guitar''. February 2006. p. 66</ref>  On ''Californication'' and ''By the Way'', Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through various chord patterns, from [[post-punk]] musician [[Vini Reilly]] of [[The Durutti Column]].<ref name="tgm2002"/> During the recording of ''Stadium Arcadium'' however, Frusciante moved away from his New Wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players, such as Hendrix and Van Halen.<ref name=interview2006/> With his recent solo work, Frusciante has cited [[electronic music]]<U+2014>in which guitar is often completely absent<U+2014>as an influence. His electronic music influences include [[Ekkehard Ehlers]], [[Peter Rehberg]] and [[Christian Fennesz]].<ref name="Kramer"/> His interests are constantly changing, as he believes that without change, he will no longer hold any interest in playing: "I'm always drawing inspiration from different kinds of music and playing guitar along with records, and I go into each new album project with a preconceived idea of what styles I want to combine."<ref name=guitarplayer2006/>
