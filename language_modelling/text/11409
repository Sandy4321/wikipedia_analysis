==Project history==
[[Image:finalmodel.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|The final design model of the Scottish Parliament Building, unveiled in September 1999.]]

Before 1707, the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] was a [[Sovereignty|sovereign independent state]] which had its own legislature<U+2014>the [[Parliament of Scotland]]<U+2014>which met, latterly, at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]] on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.<ref name="HistoricalConnection">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/history/firstscottishparliament/index.htm |title=The First Scottish Parliament: the Middle Ages <U+2013> 1707 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-11-14}}</ref> The [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]], passed in 1707, created an incorporating [[political union]] between the Kingdoms of Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]].<ref name="HistoricalConnection"/> The Union merged the Parliament of Scotland and the [[Parliament of England]] into the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] which was housed in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in [[London]].<ref name="HistoricalConnection"/> As a consequence, [[Scotland]] was directly governed from London for the next 292 years without a legislature or a Parliament building of its own.<ref name="HistoricalConnection"/>

A [[Scotland referendum, 1997|referendum]] of the Scottish electorate, held on 11 September 1997, approved the establishment of a directly-elected Scottish Parliament to legislate on most domestic affairs.<ref name="devolvedgovt">{{cite web |url=

Initially, three sites in and around Edinburgh were considered as possible locations for the building, including [[St Andrew's House]] then home of the Scottish Office<U+2014>later the [[Scottish Government]]; [[Victoria Quay]] at [[Leith]] docks and [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]] in the west end of the city.<ref name="Choosingasite"/> The Holyrood site was not an early contender as it was deemed that it would not be ready within the required timescale.<ref name="HolyroodSite">{{cite web |url=

{{cquote2|We don't want to forget that the Scottish Parliament will be in Edinburgh, but will belong to Scotland, to the Scottish land. The Parliament should be able to reflect the land it represents. The building should arise from the sloping base of [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur's Seat]] and arrive into the city almost surging out of the rock.|Enric Miralles, 1999|<ref name = "EMBT"/>
|##px|##px}}
Miralles sought to design a parliament building that could represent and present a [[Scottish national identity|national identity]]. This intractably difficult question was tackled by displacing the question of identity into the landscape of Scotland. In a characteristically poetic approach he talked about slotting the building into the land "in the form of a gathering situation: an [[amphitheatre]], coming out from Arthur's Seat." where the building would reflect a dialogue between the landscape and the act of people sitting.<ref name="Jencks"/> So an early goal of the design was to open the building and its public spaces, not just to Edinburgh but to a more general concept of the Scottish landscape. Miralles intended to use the parliament to help build the end of Canongate<U+2014>"not just another building on the street...it should reinforce the existing qualities of the site and its surroundings. In a subtle game of cross views and political implications."<ref name="work">Miralles, Enric - Work in Progress</ref>

The result was a non-hierarchical, organic collection of low-lying buildings intended to allow views of, and blend in with, the surrounding rugged scenery and symbolise the connection between [[Wildlife of Scotland|nature]] and the Scottish people.<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/><ref name="EdinburghArchitecture">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgharchitecture.co.uk/scottish_parliament.htm |title=Edinburgh Architecture - Scottish Parliament |publisher=Edinburgh Architecture |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> As a consequence the building has many features connected to nature and land, such as the leaf shaped motifs of the roof in the Garden Lobby of the building, and the large windows of the debating chamber, committee rooms and the Tower Buildings which face the broad expanse of Holyrood Park, Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags.<ref name="EMBT">{{cite web |url=http://www.mirallestagliabue.com/ |title=Scottish Parliament - concept |publisher=EMBT Architects |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> Inside the buildings, the connection to the land is reinforced by the use of [[Geology of Scotland|Scottish rock]] such as [[gneiss]] and [[granite]] in the flooring and walls, and the use of [[oak]] and [[sycamore]] in the construction of the furniture.<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/>

The Parliament is actually a campus of several buildings, reflecting different architectural styles, with a total floor area of 31,000&nbsp;[[square metre]]s (312,000&nbsp;[[square foot|sq&nbsp;ft]]),<ref name="Size">{{cite web |url=http://www.arup.com/europe/project.cfm?pageid=4727 |title=Scottish Parliament, Holyrood, Edinburgh |publisher=Arup |accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> providing accommodation for MSPs, their researchers and parliamentary staff. The buildings have a variety of features, with the most distinctive external characterisation being the roof of the Tower Buildings, said to be reminiscent of upturned boats on the shoreline.<ref name="Galinsky">{{cite web |url=

The north-western boundaries of the site, the MSPs' building, Queensberry House and the Canongate Building reinforce the existing medieval street patterns "expressing intimacy with the city and its citizens".<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/> The south-eastern aspect of the complex is extensively landscaped.<ref name="Arup"/> Concrete "branches", covered in turf and wild grass extend from the parliamentary buildings, and provide members of the public with somewhere to sit and relax.<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/> Indigenous Scottish wildflowers and plants cover much of the area, blending the Parliament's grounds with the nearby Holyrood Park and Salisbury Crags.<ref name="Arup"/> Oak, Rowan, Lime and Cherry trees have also been planted in the grounds.<ref name="Arup"/> Adjacent to the landscaped area of the complex, where it meets Horse Wynd, there is an open plan piazza, with bike racks, seating and external lighting shaped like rocks incorporated into concrete paving. Three distinctive water features provide the centrepiece for this area.<ref name="Arup"/>

[[Image:Scottish parliament elevation.JPG|thumb|right|210px|"Trigger panels" either an abstract of the skating minister or curtains drawn back from the windows.]]
References to Scottish culture are also reflected in the building and particularly on some of the building's elevations. There are a series of "trigger panels", constructed out of timber or granite. Not to everyone's taste,<ref>Charles Jencks discussed Miralles "Piling on the motifs and designs" whilst Catherine Slessor writing in the Architectural review says "The cut-outs, in both dark granite and slatted timber, give the elevations a curious appliqu<U+00E9> quality and add to the general visual hecticness"</ref> these have been said to represent [[anvil]]s, hairdryers, guns, question marks or even the [[hammer and sickle]]. Shortly after the official opening of the building, Enric Miralles' widow, [[Benedetta Tagliabue]], revealed that the design is simply that of a window curtain pulled back.<ref name="Benedetta">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Ian Swanson |coauthors= |title=Benedetta lifts curtain on mystery |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=177&id=1201712004 |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Scotsman |date=2004-10-15 |accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref> Her late husband however, enjoying the use of ambiguous forms with multiple meanings, had previously said he would love the profile to evoke an icon of Scottish culture, the painting of [[The Skating Minister|Reverend Walker skating on ice]].<ref name="work"/> The architectural critic [[Charles Jencks]] finds this a particularly apt [[metaphor]] for balanced movement and democratic debate and also notes the irony that Miralles too was skating on ice with his designs for the building.<ref name="Jencks"/> Elsewhere, in the public area beneath the debating chamber, the curved concrete vaults carry various stylised [[Flag of Scotland|Saltire]]s. Here the architect intends another metaphor; by setting the debating chamber directly above the public area, he seeks to remind MSPs whilst sitting in the chamber that their power derives from the people below them.<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/>

The Scottish Parliament Building is open to visitors all year round.<ref name="Visiting">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/visitingHolyrood/guidedTours.htm |title= Visiting Holyrood |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-12-10}}</ref> On non-sitting days, normally Mondays, Fridays and weekends as well as during parliamentary recess periods, visitors are able to view the Main Hall of the building and can access the public galleries of the debating chamber and main committee rooms.<ref name="Visiting"/> Guided tours are also available on non-sitting days and these allow visitors access to the floor of the chamber, the Garden Lobby, [[Queensberry House]] and committee rooms in the company of a parliamentary guide.<ref name="Visiting"/> On sitting days, members of the public must purchase tickets for the public galleries of both the chamber and committee rooms.<ref name="Visiting"/>

===Sustainability===
[[Image:Scottish Parliament, from Salisbury Crags.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Roof line of the Parliament intended to evoke the crags of the [[Scottish landscape]] and, in places, upturned [[Fishing industry in Scotland|fishing boats]]. [[Photovoltaic module|Solar panel]]s can also be seen, part of the building's [[sustainability]] strategy.]]
The Scottish Parliament Building was designed with a number of sustainability features in mind.<ref name="Sustainability">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/building/Environmentalfeatures.htm |title= Scottish Parliament Sustainability |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> The decision to build the Parliament on a [[brownfield]] site and its proximity to hubs of [[Transport in Scotland|public transport]] are seen as sustainable, environmentally friendly features.<ref name="Sustainability"/> A minimum of 80% of the electricity purchased for the building is required to come from renewable sources and [[Solar hot water panel|solar panels]] on the Canongate Building are used for heating water in the complex.<ref name="Sustainability"/>

A high level of insulation was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat and the use of computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive [[HVAC]] systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature in different parts of the Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day.This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by absorbing the excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25&nbsp;metres (80&nbsp;ft) deep [[bore hole]]s beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the [[Building Research Establishment]]'s Environmental Assessment Method ([[BREEAM]]).<ref name="Jencks"/>

The debating chamber contains a shallow elliptical horseshoe of seating for the MSPs, with the governing party or parties sitting in the middle of the [[Hemicycle (chamber)|semicircle]] and opposition parties on either side, similar to other European legislatures. Such a layout is intended to blur political divisions and principally reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members.<ref name="ChamberSeating">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/publicInfo/documents/Chamber.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Scottish Parliament Debating Chamber |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> This is in contrast to the "adversarial" layout reminiscent of other [[Westminster System|Westminster style national legislatures]], including the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], where government and opposition sit apart and facing one another.<ref name="Adversarial">{{cite web |url=

Cut into the western wall of the debating chamber are laminated glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber.<ref name="ChamberSeating"/> At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create the impression that the chamber is never unoccupied.<ref name="ChamberSeating"/> Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by "glass fins" which run down from light spaces in the ceiling.<ref name="DesignBuild"/> Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [Parliament] is "an [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]] building, designed with high-tech flair. You really have to go back to the Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level<U+2014>in fact, it is more creative".<ref name="sunday herald"/>

On 2 March 2006, a beam in the roof of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, resulting in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business.<ref name="Roof">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Holyrood Business halted by beam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4766552.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-02 |accessdate=2006-10-27 }}</ref> Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, [[Arup]], stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another.

===Garden Lobby===
[[Image:GardenLobby.jpg|right|thumbnail|220px|The Garden Lobby of the Scottish Parliament is an open social space noted for its distinctive leaf-shaped rooflights.]]
The Garden Lobby is at the centre of the parliamentary complex and connects the debating chamber, committee rooms and administrative offices of the Tower Buildings, with [[Queensberry House]] and the MSP building.<ref name="GardenLobby">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/building/gardenLobby.htm |title=Scottish Parliament, Garden Lobby |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> The Garden Lobby is the place where official events as well as [[Television in Scotland|television]] interviews normally take place and it is used as an open social space for MSPs and parliamentary staff.<ref name="GardenLobby"/>
The main feature of the Garden Lobby are the rooflights, which when viewed from above resemble leaves or the early [[Christian]] "[[Vesica piscis|vesica]]" shape and allow natural light into the building.<ref name="GardenLights">{{cite web |url=

===MSP building===
[[Image:ScottishParliament.jpg|left|thumbnail|220px|The distinctive windows of the MSP building inspired by [[Henry Raeburn]]'s iconic painting<U+2014>[[The Skating Minister]].]]

The MSP building is connected to the Tower Buildings by way of the Garden Lobby and stands at the western end of the parliamentary complex, adjoining Reid's Close.<ref name="MSPBlock">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/building/mspBuilding.htm |title=Scottish Parliament, MSP Building |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> The block contains offices for each MSP and two members of staff, fitted out with custom-designed furniture.<ref name="MSPBlock"/> The building is between four and six storeys in height, and is clad in granite.<ref name="MSPBlock"/> MSPs occupy 108 of the total 114 rooms in the building.<ref name="MSPBlock"/>  Each office is divided into two parts<U+2014>one for the MSP, with a floor space of 15&nbsp;square&nbsp;metres (160&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft) and another part for their staff, which has a floor space of 12&nbsp;square&nbsp;metres (130&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft).<ref name="MSPBlock"/> The most distinctive feature of the MSP block are the unusual windows which project out from the building onto the western elevation of the parliamentary complex, inspired by a combination of the repeated leaf motif and the traditional Scottish [[stepped gable]].<ref name="Jencks"/> In each office, these bay windows have a seat and shelving and are intended as "contemplation spaces".<ref name="LeopardMagazine">{{cite web |url=http://www.leopardmag.co.uk/feats/28/building-our-parliament |title=Building Our Parliament |author=Ron Gauld |publisher=Leopard Magazine, Dec 2005 |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> Constructed from stainless steel and framed in oak, with oak lattices covering the glass, the windows are designed to provide MSPs with privacy and shade from the sun.<ref name="MSPBlock"/> Criticism has been levelled at the design of the windows by some MSPs who claim that the design blocks out natural light from their offices.<ref name="BuildingWindows">{{cite news |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=105412004 |title=Holyrood windows 'put MSPs in dark' |date=2004-01-28 |author=Ian Swanson |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=The Scotsman |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> To remove the uniformity from the western side of the building, the windows jut out at different widths and angles.<ref name="Jencks"/> At its north end, the building is six storeys high (ground floor plus five) stepping down to four storeys (ground floor plus three) at the south end.<ref name="MSPBlock"/>

===Other buildings===
[[Image:ScottishParliamentFront.JPG|right|thumbnail|220px|The Public Entrance to the Scottish Parliament Building, which leads to the Main Hall.]]

Four tower buildings fan out along the front, or eastern edge, of the parliamentary complex and are notable for the curvature of their roofs.<ref name="TowerBuildings">{{cite web |url=

Originally dating from 1667, [[Queensberry House]] is an example of a seventeenth century [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] Edinburgh [[townhouse]] and contrasts with the modern architecture of the rest of the parliamentary complex.<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/> For much of its modern history, Queensberry House has been used as a hospital, army barracks, a refuge and a geriatric hospital.<ref name="QueenberryHouse">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/building/queensberryHouse.htm |title=Queensberry House |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-11-30}}</ref> In 1996, the geriatric hospital closed and the building was incorporated into the Scottish and Newcastle brewery, who owned the surrounding site. The building has been extensively refurbished, and returned to its original height of three storeys to provide facilities for the [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]], Deputy Presiding Officers, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Parliament and various parliamentary support staff.<ref name="QueenberryHouse"/> Internally and externally the building has been strengthened with reinforced steel and concrete. The original timber flooring has been replaced throughout with a mixture of carpet, vinyl, oak and Caithness stone.<ref name="QueenberryHouse"/> Queensberry House also contains the Donald Dewar Room, dedicated to the founding First Minister of Scotland who died in October 2000.

===Artwork and features===
[[Image:CanongateQuote.JPG|left|thumbnail|220px|The [[Canongate Wall]] fa<U+00E7>ade of the parliamentary complex has quotations inscribed onto pieces of rock.]]

The Main Hall of the Parliament contains a number of distinctive features and sculptures, including the gold-plated ''Honours of Scotland'' sculpture. Presented by the Queen upon the opening of the Parliament building, the sculpture is modelled on the actual [[Honours of Scotland]], the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[sceptre]] and the [[sword]] of the state, and combines these three separate elements into one composition.<ref name="Honours">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/faq/answers/art011.htm |title=Your questions answered - art |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> During meetings of the original Parliament of Scotland, the actual Honours were always present but since 1819 they have been permanently housed in [[Edinburgh Castle]].<ref name="Honours"/> The 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft) long Visitor Information Desk also stands in the Main Hall.<ref name="Desk">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/faq/answers/art012.htm |title=Visitor Information Desk |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-11-03}}</ref> Commissioned by the art strategy group, the desk combines a unique design constructed from oak and sycamore and functions as a workstation for six members of parliamentary staff.<ref name="Desk"/> At a cost of <U+00A3>88,000 the desk has been criticised by some over its price and functionality.<ref name="DeskCriticism">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Ian Swanson |coauthors= |title=<U+00A3>88k Holyrood desk 'failing' |url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=177&id=1560092006 |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Scotsman |date=2006-10-21 |accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref>

Another feature gifted to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen, following its inauguration in July 1999, is the parliamentary [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]. The mace is housed in a glass case in the debating chamber and has a formal, ceremonial role during meetings of the Parliament.<ref name="Mace">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |title=Parliament Mace to go on display at the Museum of Scotland |publisher=Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe), 1999-07-15 |accessdate=2006-12-07}}</ref> The mace sits in front of the Presiding Officers' desk and is made from silver and inlaid with gold [[Gold panning|panned]] from [[Scottish rivers]] and inscribed with the words: ''Wisdom'', ''Compassion'', ''Justice'' and ''Integrity''.<ref name="ChamberSeating"/> The words - ''There shall be a Scottish Parliament'' (which are the first words of the [[Scotland Act 1998]]), are inscribed around the head of the mace.<ref name="ChamberSeating"/> At the beginning of each session in the chamber, the case is removed to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.

==Critical response==
[[Image:Tower Buildings.jpg|right|thumbnail|210px|The Committee Rooms of the Scottish Parliament reflect the unique architectural style of Miralles, which has won much critical acclaim.]]
Public reaction to the design of the building has been mixed.<ref name="RIBA">{{cite web |url=
http://www.riba.org/go/RIBA/News/Press_5015.html |title=The Scottish Parliament wins <U+00A3>20,000 RIBA Stirling Prize in association with The Architects<U+2019> Journal |publisher=Royal Incorporation of British Architects, 2005-10-15 |accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> In the first 6 months of the building being open to the public, 250,000 people visited it, which [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|Presiding Officer]] [[George Reid (Scottish politician)|George Reid]] has said showed the public were "voting with their feet".<ref name="Feet">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-05/pa05-019.htm |title=Holyrood reaches 250,000 visitors |publisher=Scottish Parliament, 2004-03-30 |accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> Critics of the building, such as [[Margo MacDonald]] MSP, have pointed out that the high number of visitors does not prove that all of them like the building. As well as cost, criticisms of the building stem primarily from the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] and abstract architecture, the quality of the building work and the location of the building.<ref name="Worsley">{{cite news |first=Giles |last=Worsley |authorlink=Giles Worsley |author= |coauthors= |title=Talking turkey |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/08/04/bascott04.xml |work=Telegraph Entertainment |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}</ref> 

The mixed public reaction contrasts sharply with the response from architectural critics. Its rampant complexity, iconography and layering of meaning and metaphor are widely regarded as producing a building which is "quite a meal".<ref name="Jencks"/> This prompted Catherine Slessor, writing in the ''[[Architectural Review]]'', to describe it as "A Celtic-Catalan cocktail to blow both minds and budgets, it doesn't play safe, energetically mining a new seam of National Romanticism refined and reinterpreted for the twenty-first century."<ref name="ArchitectureReview"/> Jencks attempted to dampen criticism of the [[cost overruns]] by questioning how 'value for money' might be judged. For him, the building is not just a functional or economic enterprise, it is an exploration of [[Scottish national identity|national identity]] and in comparing it to other comparable assemblies, not least the [[Palace of Westminster]], he argues the cost is comparable.<ref name="Jencks"/> The conception of the building has been singled out for praise, particularly in the way it re-establishes Scotland's traditional focus towards [[mainland Europe]] and its values by means of the layout of the non-adversarial debating chamber and the creation of the public spaces in front of the building, "where people can meet and express themselves as a force". In an era of the [[Starchitect#The Bilbao Effect and the rise of .27wow-factor.27 architecture|Bilbao effect]] and the iconic building, Jencks is impressed that rather than being a monumental building, as is usual for capital landmarks, the building creates a complex union of nature and culture that nestles itself into the landscape.<ref name="Jencks"/>

The building has also won a number of awards, including an award at the VIII Biennial of Spanish Architecture, the [[Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland#RIAS Award for Architecture|RIAS Andrew Doolan Award for Architecture]], and the 2005 [[Stirling Prize]], the UK's most prestigious architecture award.<ref name="Stirling">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/stirling_prize.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Building wins Stirling Prize |publisher=e-architect, 2005-10-16 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> The inclusion of the Scottish Parliament Building on the shortlist for the Stirling Prize in 2004, led the judges to describe the building as "a statement of sparkling excellence".<ref name="Sparkling">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Matt Weaver |coauthors= |title=Scottish parliament shortlisted for Stirling Prize |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,11711,1537143,00.html |work= |publisher=The Guardian |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2006-12-26 }}</ref>   In October 2005 the building was identified as [[Prospect 100 best modern Scottish buildings|Scotland's 4th greatest modern building]] by readers of [[Prospect (architecture magazine)|''Prospect'' magazine]].

===Timeline of cost increases===
The construction of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects. Rising costs and the use of public money to fund the project generated most controversy.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> Initial estimates for constructing a new building were projected to be between <U+00A3>10m and <U+00A3>40m in 1997.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at <U+00A3>430m, some ten times greater.<ref name="finalcosts">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Holyrood price tag rises to <U+00A3>430m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3517225.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-02-24 |accessdate=2006-10-29 }}</ref>

===Controversy===
[[Image:Scottish Parliament with G8 police DSC05008.JPG|thumb|left|240px|The unique architecture of the Scottish Parliament was complicated by design changes and cost increases.]]

Notwithstanding the level of controversy surrounding cost, the Scottish Parliament Building proved controversial in a number of other respects: the decision to construct a new building, the choice of site, the selection of a non-Scottish architect, and the selection of [[Bovis]] as construction manager after having earlier been excluded from the shortlist.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> In 1997, the initial cost of constructing a new Parliament building was given as <U+00A3>40 million, a figure produced by the Scottish Office, prior to the September 1997 devolution referendum, and subsequently revealed to be the figure for housing MSPs.<ref name="ScotsmanTimeline"/> Further controversy surrounding the project sprang from the selection of the Holyrood site, which was a late entrant onto the list of sites to be considered, and the rejection of the [[New Parliament House, Edinburgh|Royal High School]] on [[Calton Hill]], long thought to be the home of any future [[devolved]] Scottish Parliament.

Control of the building project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party [[Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body]] (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, at a time of increasing costs.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament was working at its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems.<ref name="RoyalHighSchool">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/holyrood/inquiry/sp205-09.htm#6 |title=Budget Increase - Spring 1999 |author=Peter Fraser |publisher=The Holyrood Inquiry, Sep 2004 |accessdate=2006-12-09}}</ref> With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project,<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.<ref name="BuildingVote">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-99/or011010.htm |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report 17 June 1999 |accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref>

In August 1999, the architect informed the project group that the Parliament would need to be further increased in size by 4,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;metres (43,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft).<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to <U+00A3>115m by September 1999.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by the architect John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of <U+00A3>30m.<ref name="Spencely">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Report says 'Holyrood site stays' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/695252.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2000-03-30 |accessdate=2006-12-13 }}</ref> Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly.<ref name="Spencely"/> Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.<ref name="SpencelyMSPs">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/officialReports/meetingsParliament/or-00/or051302.htm#Col1290 |title=Scottish Parliament Official Report - 5 April 2000 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref>

The project was also complicated by the deaths of Miralles in July 2000, of Dewar the following October and the existence of a multi-headed client consisting of the SPCB, the Presiding Officer and an architectural advisor. The client took over the running of the project from the Scottish Executive (formerly the Scottish Office) while it was already under construction. Subsequently, the events of [[9/11]] led to further design changes, especially with regard to security, which again resulted in rising costs.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> However, it was later rejected that the re-designs required to incorporate greater security into the building structure were the "single biggest" factor affecting the increased costs of the project.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/>

By March 2004 the cost had reached the sum of <U+00A3>430m (compared to an original budget of <U+00A3>55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed).<ref name="ResearchPaper"/> This equates to <U+00A3>85 for each of the 5.1 million people in Scotland.<ref name="Population">{{cite web |url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/press/2006-news/scotlands-population-rises-for-third-year-in-a-row.html |title=Population up for a third year |publisher=General Register Office for Scotland, 2006-04-27 |accessdate=2006-12-06}}</ref> A report published by the [[Auditor General for Scotland]] in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced.<ref name="AuditorGen2">{{cite web |url=http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2004/04pf07ag.pdf |format=PDF|title=Management of the Holyrood Building Project |publisher=Audit Scotland, June 2004 |accessdate=2006-12-13}}</ref> The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from <U+00A3>195m in September 2000 to <U+00A3>431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor.<ref name="AuditorGen2"/> The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.<ref name="ResearchPaper"/>

==Fraser Inquiry==

In May 2003 the First Minister, [[Jack McConnell]], announced a major [[public inquiry]] into the handling of the building project. The inquiry (known as the Holyrood Inquiry, or the Fraser Inquiry) was headed by [[Peter Fraser, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Fraser of Carmyllie]] and held at the [[Scottish Land Court]] in Edinburgh. The inquiry took evidence from architects, civil servants, politicians and the building companies. Evidence was taken over the course of 49 hearings and the final report ran to 300 pages.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/>

===Criticisms===
Presenting his report in September 2004, Lord Fraser told how he was "astonished" that year after year the ministers who were in charge were kept so much in the dark over the increases in cost estimates.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/> He also stated that a Parliament building of sufficient scale could never have been built for less than <U+00A3>50m, and was "amazed" that the belief that it could be was perpetuated for so long.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/> He believed that from at least April 2000, when MSPs commissioned the Spencely Report to decide whether the building should continue, it should have been realised that the building was bound to cost in excess of <U+00A3>200m.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/> Furthermore, <U+00A3>150m of the final cost was wasted as a result of design delays, over-optimistic programming and uncertain authority.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/>

Despite having only an outline design, the designers RMJM/EMBT (Scotland) Ltd stated without foundation that the building could be completed within a <U+00A3>50m budget.<ref name="Conclusions">{{cite web |url=
http://www.holyroodinquiry.org/FINAL_report/conclusions.pdf |format=PDF|author=Peter Fraser |title=Conclusions and Recommendations (PDF) |publisher=Holyrood Inquiry |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2006-12-17}}</ref> Nevertheless, these estimates were believed by officials.<ref name="Conclusions"/> The two architectural practices in the RMJM and EMBT joint venture operated dysfunctionally and failed to communicate effectively with each other and the project manager.<ref name="Conclusions"/> The death of Miralles also gave rise to a substantial period of disharmony.<ref name="Conclusions"/> The Brief emphasised the importance of design and quality over cost, and was not updated despite considerable evolution of the design.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/> Ministers were not informed of grave concerns within the Scottish Office over the cost of the project and officials failed to take the advice of the cost consultants.<ref name="Conclusions"/>

The Scottish Office decided to procure the construction work under a "[[construction management contract]]", rather than under a [[Private Finance Initiative]], in order to speed construction, but without properly evaluating the financial risks of doing so, and - in a decision that Fraser stated "beggars belief" - without asking Ministers to approve it.<ref name="FraserSpeech"/><ref name="Conclusions"/> This was one of the two most flawed decisions which the report singled out,<ref name="FraserSpeech"/> the other was the insistence on a rigid programme.<ref name="Conclusions"/> Officials decided that rapid delivery of the new building was to be the priority, but that quality should be maintained. It was therefore inevitable that the cost would suffer. The client was obsessed with early completion and failed to understand the impact on cost and the completion date if high-quality work and a complex building were required.<ref name="Conclusions"/> In attempting to achieve early completion, the management contractor produced optimistic programmes, to which the architects were unwise to commit.<ref name="Conclusions"/> The main causes of the slippage were delays in designing a challenging project that was to be delivered against a tight timetable using an unusual [[procurement]] route.<ref name="Conclusions"/>

The inquiry was widely seen as clearing Donald Dewar for the initial mishandling of the project.<ref name="Dewarblame">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Stephanie Todd |coauthors= |title=Fraser lays final Holyrood stone |url=
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3659940.stm |work=BBC Scotland news |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2007-01-02 }}</ref> This came after speculation suggesting that Dewar was aware that the initial costs of a new Parliament Building, circulated to the public, were too low.<ref name="Dewarblame1">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author=Jason Allardyce |coauthors=Murdo Macleod |title=Blaming and shaming |url=

He relied on cost figures given to him by senior civil servants."<ref name="Conclusions"/> The inquiry also resisted the temptation to "lay all of the blame at the door of a deceased wayward architectural genius [Miralles].....costs rose because the client wanted increases and changes or at least approved of them in one manifestation or other."<ref name="Conclusions"/>

===Reaction and recommendations===
In his report, Lord Fraser set out a number of recommendations stemming from the inquiry. Primarily, in terms of design selection and when using an international architect linking with a Scottish based firm, the report advised that a full analysis of the compatibility of different working cultures and practices needs to be made.<ref name="Conclusions"/>

Lord Fraser advocated that when "construction management" contracts were used, civil servants or [[Local government of Scotland|local government]] officials should evaluate the risks of such a contract and set out the advantages and disadvantages of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors.<ref name="Conclusions"/> Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being "filtered" by public officials.<ref name="Conclusions"/> Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous as standards applied in the [[private sector]].<ref name="Conclusions"/> 

Following publication of the report, Jack McConnell stated that the Fraser recommendations would be fully implemented, and that fundamental reform of the civil service was already under way, with trained professionals being recruited to handle such projects.<ref name="Reaction">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=McConnell in post-Fraser pledge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3658840.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2006-12-15 }}</ref> The First Minister emphasised that he was keen to see an increase in the specialist skills of civil servants, in order for them to be able to administer projects of such magnitude in the future.<ref name="Reaction"/> [[John Elvidge]], the most senior civil servant in Scotland, admitted that best practice had not been followed and apologised for the way the project had been handled.<ref name="Elvidge">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Civil Servants in Holyrood Probe |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3668396.stm |work=BBC Scotland News |publisher=BBC |date=2004-09-18 |accessdate=2006-12-15 }}</ref> He did not rule out the possibility of taking disciplinary action against civil service staff,<ref name="Elvidge"/> although subsequent Scottish Government investigations resulted in no action being taken against individual public officials involved with the project.<ref name="Elvidge2">{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=No disciplinary action after Holyrood Inquiry |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2004/11/25133828 |work= |publisher=Scottish Government |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2006-12-18 }}</ref>
