'''John Shaft''' is a fictional character created by screenwriter/novelist [[Ernest Tidyman]] as a sort of [[African-American]] answer to [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]]. He was portrayed by [[Richard Roundtree]] in the [[Shaft|1971 film]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] portrayed his nephew (also named John Shaft) in the [[Shaft (2000 film)|2000 version]] of the film. The blurb on the paperback on which the original film is based states Shaft is "Hotter than Bond, cooler than [[Bullitt]]."

==John Shaft in Other Media==
*[[Burger King]] utilized the Shaft character for promotion. And even somewhat parodied Shaft utilizing [[Shaquille O'Neal]].
* The USA Network's promo for their series ''[[Monk]]'' was modeled after the Shaft remake in 2000.
*[[Geena Davis]] parodied the Shaft remake/sequel in promos for her short-lived television series, ''[[The Geena Davis Show]]''.

==Shaft-isms==
* Towards the end of the film, during the final showdown, Shaft usually dons a leather outfit, fitted with a high-powered shotgun. (This was done in the [[Shaft (1971 movie)|1971]] movie and ''[[Shaft's Big Score]]'', but not in ''[[Shaft in Africa]]'' or the [[Shaft (2000 movie)|sequel/spinoff]]). 

*''Shaft's Big Score'' and ''Shaft in Africa'' featured a teaser that had no music, just a hook, establishing the plot. Afterwhich, the opening credits with a vocalist song would show Shaft heading to the location of the crime. (The first film, ''Shaft'' featured Shaft heading to the scene of the crime with the famous ''[[Isaac Hayes]]'' theme on the [[soundtrack]], or at least, heading towards where the plot would be established, but no teaser).

* Ernest Tidyman's final Shaft book ''The Last Shaft'' ([[1975]]) depicted the death of John Shaft in the conclusion. Despite this, the same John Shaft, as portrayed by Roundtree, was featured in a [[cameo role]] in the remake, in which he gave his nephew John, as portrayed by Jackson, his P.I. business.
