For the period their coal, water and old consumption was moderate while all perfored their daily tasks well.<U+201D><ref>Bradley (1979) pp. 10-14</ref> His classes included [[0-4-4]] suburban [[tank engine|tanks]] of the [[LCDR A class|A]], [[LCDR A1 class|A1]], [[LCDR A2 class|A2]], [[LCDR R class|R]],  and [[LCDR R1 class|R1]] classes; [[0-6-0|Six coupled]] goods classes [[LCDR B class|B]], [[LCDR B1 class|B1]], and [[LCDR B2 class|B2]] classes; six coupled tanks of the [[LCDR T class|T class]]; and [[4-4-0]] express passenger locomotives of the [[LCDR M class|M]], [[LCDR M1 class|M1]], [[LCDR M2 class|M2]] and [[LCDR M3 class|M3]] classes.
