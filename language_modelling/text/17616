==Biography==
===Early life===

His stage personality, Verka Serduchka, is an extravagant, flamboyant woman. Under this disguise Andriy has been performing since the early 1990s. This stage name was invented by Andriy for the [[KVN]] student humour contest, combining the randomly picked first name Verka with the real last name of his former school classmate Anya Serduk.<ref name="why_serduk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/23171/25154/|title=Danylko become Serduchka because of school girlfriend|publisher=kp.ru|date=[[2003-12-04]]|language=Russian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marusia.ru/show2000/12-02.html|title=Interview with Verka Serduchka-Danylko|first=Elena|last=Ryzancheva|language=Russian}}</ref> Apart from pop and dance numbers Andriy lately began to appear under his real name performing [[Ambient music|ambient]] musical compositions. His popularity, however, is firmly established in his stage personality of Verka Serduchka and most of his performances are done under this stage name.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s he hosted a [[talk show]] called "SV-show" ("SV" is an acronym for {{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+043F><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0412><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+043D>, "Spalniy Vagon"}}, which means a [[sleeping car]]) on different Ukrainian television channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/serduchka/|title=Danylko's biogrpahy|language=Russian}}</ref>

===Eurovision Song Contest===
[[Image:Ukraineeurovision2007.jpg|thumb|225px|Verka Serduchka with her ensemble in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007.]]

Verka was chosen to [[Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|represent]] [[Ukraine]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], with the song "[[Dancing Lasha Tumbai]]" in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]],<ref name="podrobnosti">{{cite web|url=http://www.podrobnosti.ua/culture/music/2007/03/10/404185.html |title=Verka Serduchka went to the Eurovision-2007 song contest |accessdate= |accessmonthday=March 17 |accessyear=2007 |work=Podrobnosti.ua |language=Russian |publisher=}}</ref> finishing in second place.

Ukraine was automatically put in the final thanks to the top-ten finish of last year's Ukrainian representative [[Tina Karol]] with the song "Show Me Your Love". The song "Dancing Lasha Tumbai" is sung in 5 languages: [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]. However, several [[Mongols]] on a [[talk show]] by [[Channel One (Russia)]], which was shown just before the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] claimed that there is no phrase "Lasha Tumbai" in their [[Mongolic languages|language]] and one of them pronounced the correct Mongolian phrase for "whipped cream".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gpu-ua.info/index.php?&id=162058 |title=Russian Channel One Takes Offence at Verka Serduchka |accessdate= |accessmonthday=May 21|accessyear=2007 |work=Ukrainian Newspaper |language=Ukrainian|publisher=}}</ref> The Mongolian embassy in Moscow also said that "lasha tumbai" was total [[gibberish]].<ref>"[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/070512/entertainment/afpentertainment_ukraine Ukrainian drag queen a front-runner at Eurovision]" Retrieved on [[May 21]], [[2007]].</ref>

Participation of Andriy Danylko in Eurovision was not without controversy in Ukraine. One of the all-nation FM radio stations organized in February an action of protest to express their disapproval with the selection of Serduchka to represent the country <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntn.tv/news/ukraine/07/02/23/10/53.html |title=<U+00AB>No to Euroserduchka!<U+00BB> - protest action of an FM radio station|accessdate= |accessmonthday=May 10 |accessyear=2007 |<U+00AB><U+0422><U+0435><U+043B><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0443><U+0434><U+0456><U+044F> <U+00AB><U+0421><U+043B><U+0443><U+0436><U+0431><U+0430> <U+0456><U+043D><U+0444><U+043E><U+0440><U+043C><U+0430><U+0446><U+0456><U+0457><U+00BB> |language=Ukrainian|publisher=}}</ref>. Some Ukrainians and even members of the [[Verkhovna Rada|Ukrainian Parliament]] expressed their disapproval with Serduchka's participation in the contest, which they see as a "grotesque and vulgar."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6516927.stm |title=Eurovision act angers Ukrainians |accessdate= |accessmonthday=May 11 |accessyear=2007 |work=BBC News |language=English|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ua.korrespondent.net/main/68684 |title=Eurovision: Verka Serduchka will disgrace Ukraine |accessdate= |accessmonthday=May 11 |accessyear=2007 |work=[[Korrespondent]] |language=Ukrainian|publisher=}}</ref>

The single for Dancing Lasha Tumbai went on to be #28 on [[The Official UK Singles Chart]] on [[May 20]], [[2007]]. This was the first time a non-UK non-winning Eurovision entry charted in the UK since 1974. He then made a brief phone-in appearance on the [[BBC]]s ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', in which his comments made no sense whatsoever. Another call was made, but with a translator in the audience, who told guest [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] he was "rubbish".

===Personal life===

Danylko is known to be not too talkative about his personal life, but he stated that he has lived with a woman for 8 years, though that it was a hard experience for him, and after the breakup he became more creative again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gay.ru/news/rainbow/2005/01/19c.htm |title=Andriy Danylko: "I had a difficult experience living together with a woman..." |accessdate= |accessmonthday=May 13 |accessyear=2007 |language=Russian |publisher=Gay.ru}}</ref>
