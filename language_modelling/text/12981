'''Hurricane Ioke''' (was also '''Typhoon Ioke''', international designation: '''''0612''''', JTWC designation: '''''01C''''', and sometimes called '''Super Typhoon Ioke''') was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Central [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. The first storm to form in the Central Pacific in the [[2006 Pacific hurricane season]], Ioke was a record breaking, long-lived and extremely powerful storm that traversed the Pacific for 19&nbsp;days, reaching the equivalent of [[List of Category 5 Pacific hurricanes|Category 5]] status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] three times. 

The cyclone developed from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] on [[August 20]] far to the south of [[Hawaii]]. Encountering warm waters, little [[wind shear]], and well-defined [[outflow (meteorology)|outflow]], Ioke intensified from a tropical depression to [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] status within 48&nbsp;hours. Late on [[August 22]] it rapidly weakened to Category 2 status before crossing over [[Johnston Atoll]]. Two days later favorable conditions again allowed for [[rapid deepening|rapid strengthening]], and Ioke attained Category 5 status on [[August 25]] before crossing the [[International Date Line]]. As it continued westward its intensity fluctuated, and on [[August 31]] it passed near [[Wake Island]] with winds of 155&nbsp;[[mph]] (250&nbsp;km/h). Ioke gradually weakened as it turned northwestward and northward, and by [[September 6]] it had transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. The remnants of Ioke accelerated northeastward and ultimately crossed into [[Alaska]].

Ioke did not affect any permanently populated areas in the Central Pacific or Western Pacific basins as a hurricane or a typhoon. A crew of 12&nbsp;people rode out the hurricane in a hurricane-proof bunker on Johnston Atoll; the crew estimated winds reached over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h), which damaged trees on the island but did not impact the island bird population. The hurricane left moderate damage on [[Wake Island]] totaling $88&nbsp;million (2006&nbsp;USD), including blown off roofs and damaged buildings, though the infrastructure of the island was left intact; all military personnel were evacuated from the island. Later, the extratropical remnants of Ioke produced a severe storm surge along the [[Alaska]]n coastline, causing beach erosion.

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Ioke 2006 track.png}}
The [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) spawned a tropical disturbance with a low-level circulation far to the southeast of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] in the middle of [[August 2006]]. Under the influence of a strong westward-moving [[subtropical ridge]] to its north, the disturbance tracked nearly due westward, with deep convection in the region increasing and decreasing on a daily basis. It slowly became better organized, and early on [[August 20]] the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression One-C while located about 775&nbsp;[[statute mile|mi]] (1250&nbsp;km) south of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. At the time, there was no convection associated with the ITCZ within 10<U+00B0>&nbsp;[[Longitude]].<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=2007|title=2006 Tropical Cyclones Central North Pacific|accessdate=2007-10-06|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2006.php}}</ref>

Hurricane Ioke, with a portion of its eye crossing the atoll, left an estimated 15% of the palm trees on the island with their tops blown off, with some ironwood trees blown over; the island bird population was unaffected.
