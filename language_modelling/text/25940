'''Visby Cathedral''' ({{lang-sv|Visby domkyrka}}, officially ''Visby S:ta Maria domkyrka'') is a [[cathedral]] in [[Visby]] in Sweden. Belonging to [[Visby Cathedral Parish]] of the [[Church of Sweden]], it serves the [[Diocese of Visby]].<ref name=ne /> and was inaugurated on 27 July in 1225.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slottsguiden.info/slottdetalj.asp?id=168|title=S:ta Maria Domkyrka, Sverige|publisher=Slottsguiden|language=Swedish|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

== History ==
Visby Cathedral was built as a church for German traders in Visby. It was financed by a fee that every German trader arriving in Visby had to pay.<ref name="gotkyrkor">{{cite book |editor1-last=Lagerl<U+00F6>f|editor1-first=Erland|last= Svahnstr<U+00F6>m|first= Gunnar|authorlink= |title= Gotlands kyrkor|language=Swedish|url= http://libris.kb.se/bib/7232718|year= 1973|publisher= Rab<U+00E9>n & Sj<U+00F6>gren|location= Uddevalla|isbn= 9129410355|pages=45<U+2013>51}}</ref><ref name="kulturen">{{cite book |last1= Jonsson|first1= Marita|last2=Lindquist|first2=Sven-Olof|language=Swedish|authorlink= |title= V<U+00E4>gen till kulturen p<U+00E5> Gotland|url= |year= 1987|publisher= Gotlands fornsal|location= Visby|isbn= 91-971048-1-7|page=113<U+2013>114}}</ref> Construction started at the end of the 12th century, and the church was probably finished circa 1190. Rebuilding of the church seems to have started already in 1211 however, and in 1225 a new [[choir (architecture)|choir]] was inaugurated.<ref name="DMG">{{cite book |last= Andr<U+00E9>n|first= Anders|language=Swedish|authorlink= |title= Det Medeltida Gotland. En arkeologisk guidebok|url= |year= 2011|publisher= Historiska Media|location= Lund|isbn= 978-91-85873-83-8|pages=105<U+2013>108}}</ref> Originally the church was probably only used by visiting Germans, but as some of these settled permanently in Visby, it developed into a church for both resident and visiting German traders, and with time also native Gotlanders. Therefore, when it was consecrated in 1225 by the [[Diocese of Link<U+00F6>ping|Bishop of Link<U+00F6>ping]], it was declared a church for two congregations, each with their own priest: one for visitors, and one for natives.<ref name="DMG" /> It developed into one of the most important churches of the city, and by the late [[Middle Ages]] it was the second largest church in Visby. It is today the only medieval church of Visby still in use, with twelve other churches in the town [[List of church ruins on Gotland|preserved as ruins]] only.<ref name="DMG" />

Following the [[Reformation in Denmark<U+2013>Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the church was transformed into a parish church for the town of Visby. All other churches were abandoned. Shortly after the Reformation, in 1572, Gotland was made into its own Diocese, and the church designated its cathedral.<ref name="gotkyrkor" />

== Architecture ==
[[File:Visby Dom v O.JPG|thumb|upright|View of the cathedral from the east]]
The first church was probably a three-aisled [[basilica]] with a large, single western tower adorned with galleries.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /><ref name="DMG" /> Its [[transept]] extended beyond the main building towards the north and south. Unusually, it lacked a choir projecting towards the east, and thus was almost T-shaped, barring, possibly, a central [[apse]] or lesser apses projecting from the transept. Stylistically, this first church was similar to [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches from [[Westphalia]] and the [[Rhine Valley]].<ref name="gotkyrkor" /> A few details seem however to be unique. Among these is the arrangement of the tower gallery. This in turn came to inspire many more [[churches on Gotland]], providing a rather distinct architectural style.<ref name="gotkyrkor" />

Of this first edifice, the gables of the transept, a single portal, the tower up until the uppermost [[corbel table]] and some pillars are all that remain.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /> As noted above, the eastern part of the church was rebuilt during the early 13th century. The transept was doubled in size, a new choir added to the east of it and in the angle between the choir and the transept, two towers constructed. During this construction period, a new southern portal, still [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] in style, was sculpted. After an interval of a few years, a new reconstruction scheme began. The [[nave]] was now enlarged to become as wide as the transept, in effect transforming the church from a basilica to a [[hall church]]. Again, the models can be traced to western Germany.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /> The superfluous space between the ceiling and roof was turned into a very large attic.<ref name="kulturen" /> In the easternmost vault of the church, constituting the ceiling of the choir, a round hole exists. Scholars believe that this hole was used during enactments of the story of the [[Passion of Christ]], to pull up a wooden statue of Christ in order to illustrate his very concrete ascent to heaven.<ref name="DMG" />

[[File:Visby Sankta Maria Side view01.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the cathedral from the south]]
After another interval, this time for about a hundred years, a large, pronouncedly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] chapel was added to the south fa<U+00E7>ade. A smaller, equally Gothic chapel, was also added to the church. One of these chapels, dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria]] was paid for by the sons of a mayor, Herman Swertling, who had been executed for treason in 1342. A papal permission for the erection of the chapel is dated 1349. Scholars disagree as to which of the chapels was the one paid for by the sons of Herman Swertling.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /><ref name="kulturen" /><ref name="DMG" /> The larger of the chapels was the first building in High Gothic style to be built on Gotland.<ref name="DMG" />

Few alterations have been made since the end of the Middle Ages. Most have been due to the fact that the cathedral has been damaged by fire on different occasions. The tower roofs or steeples date from 1746 (the west tower) and 1761 (the eastern towers) respectively. One of the two medieval chapels was reconstructed externally in 1761, changing the Gothic gables for [[Baroque]] gables. These were however removed in 1899<U+2013>1901, when the building was restored in a somewhat [[Gothic revival]] fashion by [[Axel Haig]] ({{lang-sv|Axel Herman H<U+00E4>gg}}). H<U+00E4>gg or Haig was born on Gotland (in [[Katthamra]] manor) but lived in England at the time of the renovation. As a consequence, some of the alterations, notably the new [[sacristy]], is in a typical English Gothic revival style.<ref name="gotkyrkor" />

The cathedral was renovated in the 1980s.<ref name="kulturen" />

=== Furnishings ===
[[File:Visby Sankta Maria Altar 04.jpg|thumb|right|The (present) main altarpiece]]
Among the furnishings, only a few are original. The [[baptismal font]] is an undecorated font from the 13th century, executed in reddish limestone. A single wooden sculpture of Christ, dating from the late 13th century, also survives in the cathedral. In addition, the cathedral has many preserved tombstones (no less than 414), some of which are medieval. Among them is the tombstone of the son of [[Albert, King of Sweden|Albert]], Duke of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] and at one time king of Sweden. The [[altarpiece]] is neo-Gothic and dates from Haig's renovation.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /> The original altarpiece is however preserved in [[K<U+00E4>llunge church|K<U+00E4>llunge Church]], to which it was sold already at the beginning of the 16th century.<ref name="DMG" /> This altarpiece was replaced by an altarpiece made in 1682 in [[Burgsvik]] on Gotland, which is still preserved in the cathedral. An additional former altarpiece, dating from 1808, is likewise also preserved in the cathedral itself. The current altarpiece is thus the fourth known altarpiece of the cathedral, all of which are preserved.<ref name="gotkyrkor" /> The [[pulpit]], dating from 1684 and possibly made in [[L<U+00FC>beck]], also has a preserved predecessor, made in 1548 and today in [[Gr<U+00F6>tlingbo Church]].<ref name="gotkyrkor" />

The [[pew]]s date from 1945, and a [[carillon]] in the south-eastern tower from 1960. A number of memorial plaques and epitaphs adorn the walls of the cathedral, notably one in remembrance of the sinking of a [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[Free City of L<U+00FC>beck|L<U+00FC>beck]] fleet outside Visby in 1566 and one in remembrance of the sinking of the Swedish passenger ship [[SS Hansa (1899)|SS ''Hansa'']] in 1944 by a Soviet submarine.<ref name="gotkyrkor" />
