'''Lionel Poil<U+00E2>ne''' (June 10, 1945 &ndash; [[October 31]], [[2002]]) was a [[France|French]] ''boulanger'' ([[artisan]] baker) and entrepreneur whose commitment to crafting quality [[bread]] earned him prestige throughout the world.  His father Pierre Poil<U+00E2>ne started a baking business in 1932, creating bread using stone-ground flour, [[Yeast (baking)|natural fermentation]] and a wood-fired oven.  Lionel took over the bakery in 1970, continuing the traditional methods.  

Poil<U+00E2>ne is most famous for a round, two-kilogram [[sourdough]] country bread referred to as a ''miche'' or ''pain Poil<U+00E2>ne''. This bread is often referred to as wholewheat but in fact is not: the flour used is mostly so-called ''grey flour'' of 85% extraction (meaning that some but not all of the wheat bran is retained). According to Poil<U+00E2>ne's own website, the dough also contains 30% spelt, an ancestor of wheat.

In addition to ''miches'', the Poil<U+00E2>ne bakery offers [[rye]] bread, raisin bread, nut bread, Punitions ([[shortbread]] cookies), and an assortment of pastries to its clients.  Poil<U+00E2>ne is perhaps one of the most famous names in the baking industry today.

Poil<U+00E2>ne mastered his single product and trained his apprentices in the physical baking process, which he believed to be the most important aspect of his vision.  He believed as much of the work as possible should be done by hand, by one person taking responsibility for their loaves from start to finish.  Lionel Poil<U+00E2>ne laid the basis of a concept he called "retro-innovation"; combining the best of traditional elements together with the best of modern developments.  The only deviation from his father's original formula was machine kneading, saving hours of work for his bakers.

''Pain Poil<U+00E2>ne'' is produced in the [[Latin Quarter]] of [[Paris]] where it is sold at the original ''boulangerie'' on ''rue du Cherche-Midi''.  A second Paris bakery on ''boulevard de Grenelle'' is located in the [[XVe arrondissement|15e arrondissement]].  The worldwide demand for Poil<U+00E2>ne bread is met in a facility located in [[Bi<U+00E8>vres]] which was built in the 1980s.  The Bi<U+00E8>vres bakery produces around 15,000 loaves per day in 24 wood-burning ovens which are exact replicas of the ovens used at the Paris locations.  These loaves are shipped worldwide.  The firm opened a facility in [[London|London's]] [[Belgravia]] district in June 2000.

On October 31, 2002, Lionel Poil<U+00E2>ne was killed when the [[helicopter]] he was piloting crashed into the [[Bay of Cancale]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].  The passengers, Poil<U+00E2>ne's wife Ir<U+00E9>na and their dog, also died in the crash.  Poil<U+00E2>ne was survived by his daughter Apollonia who now runs the enterprise. She is a graduate of [[Harvard University]].[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/01/22/8397991/][http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516402]

Lionel's brother Max Poil<U+00E2>ne went his own way and opened his own bakery. There are 3 Max Poil<U+00E2>ne bakery locations in Paris. Bread lovers debate on which baker makes the better bread, although Lionel's bread is more famous outside of Paris.
