'''Mexicali''' (pronounced {{Audio-IPA|MexicaliPronunciation.ogg|mexi'kali}}) is the capital of the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Baja California]], seat of the [[Mexicali Municipality|Municipality of Mexicali]], and [[List of Baja California cities|2nd largest]] city in Baja California. The City of Mexicali has a population of 689,775, according to the 2010 census, while the population of the entire metropolitan area (as well the municipality) reaches 996,826.

The city maintains a highly educated and skilled populace. Its standard of living is one of the highest in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} As the city has modernized and become a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] and [[international]] center in a desert region, it has maintained a sizable middle class.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In Mexico, it is recognized for its substantial investment in education as well as its low unemployment levels.

Mexicali's economy was historically based on agricultural products, and to this day it remains a large sector of the economy. As time has progressed however, its economy has gradually gone from being agriculturally based to industrially based. Companies such as [[Mitsubishi]], [[Autolite]], [[Nestle]], [[Coca Cola]] and [[Goodrich Corporation]] have built plants in the city and its metropolitan area. [[Silicon Border]] is located here as well; a large industrial park that is a high tech manufacturing area.<ref name="Silicon Border">{{cite web |title=Silicon Border |url=http://www.siliconborder.com/ |accessdate=March 8, 2011 }}</ref> Its goal is to become a global center for semiconductor manufacturing. Mexicali's proximity to the United States has made the city a popular tourist destination with Americans from [[Arizona]], [[California]], and [[Nevada]]. The city is a well known sports city with many ball sports being popular in the region.

Founded on March 14, 1903, Mexicali is situated on the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] adjacent to its sister city [[Calexico, California]], with which it forms a metropolitan region, [[Calexico-Mexicali]]. Mexicali also has the distinction of being the northernmost city in [[Latin America]].

== History ==

===Early history===
The Spanish arrived in the area after crossing the [[Sonora Desert]]'s "[[Camino del Diablo]]" or Devil's Road. This led to the evangelization of the area by Catholic missionaries and also the population reduction of the native peoples. Today, indigenous [[Cocopah]] people still inhabit a small government-protected corner of the delta near the junction of the [[Hardy River|Hardy]] and Colorado rivers. These people mostly work on agricultural [[ejido]]s or fish the rivers, although many have migrated to Mexicali.<ref name="bajaweb">{{cite web |url=http://www.baja-web.com/mexicali/mexicali.htm |title=Baja Web Mexicali |accessdate=2008-11-02}}</ref>

The early European presence in this area was limited to [[Juan Bautista de Anza|Anza]]'s and subsequent Spanish expeditions across the [[Colorado Desert]] and subsequent travelers on the [[Sonora Road]] opened by them.  Also the presence of the [[Jesuit]]s who attempted to establish a mission at what is now Fort Yuma.  They left after a revolt by the [[Quechan people|Yuma]] in 1781.  After this, the Spanish had little to do with the northeastern corner of the [[Baja California peninsula]], perceiving it as an untamable, flood-prone desert delta.<ref name="bajaweb"/>  Later in the 1820's, the Mexican authorities reopened the Sonora Road, peaceful relations being restored with the Yuma.<ref>George William Beattie, Reopening the Anza Road, The Pacific Historical Review, Vol. 2, No. 1. (Mar., 1933), pp. 52-71</ref>

The Sonora Road provided a route for American fur trappers, and later American troops of [[Stephen W. Kearny|Kearny]] and [[Philip St. George Cooke|Cooke]] passing through the area during the [[Mexican American War]].  The annexation of most of [[Alta California]] soon was followed by the [[California Gold Rush]] that saw a flood of gold seekers from Mexico on the Sonora Road, especially from Sonora, and from the United states via the [[Southern Immigrant Trail]].  Herds of cattle and sheep were driven into California across this desert trail also.

This route became a U. S. Mail and [[stagecoach]] route in 1857 when the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]] and in 1858 [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] route passed along the Alamo and New Rivers and established stations there including its [[New River Station]] in the vicinity of a Laguna along the New River in what is now [[Colonia Hidalgo, Mexicali|Colonia Hidalgo]], Mexicali in 1858.  This mail route remained in use until 1877 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] came to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] making it obsolete.

===Later 19th century===
In the mid-19th century, a geologist working for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] came to the delta area, discovering what the native Yumans had known for centuries: that the thick river sediment deposits made the area prime farming land. These sediments extended far to the west of the river itself, accumulating in a shallow basin below the Sierra de Cucap<U+00E1>.<ref name="bajaweb"/> However, from this time period until the 1880s, the area was almost completely unpopulated, mostly due to its climate. In 1888, the federal government granted a large part of northern Baja state, including Mexicali, to Guillermo Andrade, with the purpose of colonizing the area on the recently created border with the United States. However, around 1900, the only area with any real population, aside from the Cocopah, were concentrated in [[Los Algodones, Baja California|Los Algodones]], to the east of Mexicali.<ref name="EncMuc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/bajacalifornia/municipios/02002a.htm |title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios Baja California Mexicali |accessdate=2008-11-03 |language=Spanish }}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1900, the U.S.-based [[California Development Company]] received permission from the [[Porfirio Diaz|D<U+00ED>az]] government to cut a [[Alamo Canal|canal]] through the delta's Arroyo Alamo, to link the dry basin with the [[Colorado River]]. To attract farmers to the area, the developers named it "[[Imperial Valley (California)|The Imperial Valley]]". In 1903, the first 500 farmers arrived; by late 1904, 405&nbsp;km<U+00B2> (100,000 acres) of valley were irrigated, with 10,000 people settled on the land harvesting cotton, fruits, and vegetables. The concentration of small housing units that straddled the border was called Calexico on the U.S. side, Mexicali on the Mexican side.<ref name="bajaweb"/> Led by ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher [[Harry Chandler]], one company controlled 800,000 hectares of land in northern Baja California by 1905, and began to construct the irrigation system for this valley.  However, instead of using Mexican labor to dig the ditches, Chandler brought in thousands of Chinese laborers.<ref name="bajaweb"/>  Mexicali became culturally more Chinese than Mexican.

The Mexican side was named Mexicali (a [[portmanteau]] composed of "Mexico" and "California") by Coronel Agust<U+00ED>n Sangin<U+00E9>z. Initially the area belonged to the municipality of [[Ensenada Municipality|Ensenada]].<ref name="EncMuc"/> The town of Mexicali was officially created on 14 March 1903 when [[Manuel Vizcarra]] was named as the town's first authority and assistant judge (''juez auxiliar'').<ref name="bajaweb"/> On January 29, 1911, Mexicali was [[Capture of Mexicali|briefly "liberated" by the Liberal Party of Mexico]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Mayor Baltazar Avil<U+00E9>z declared the municipality of Mexicali on November 4, 1914 and called for elections to create the first [[ayuntamiento]] or district council, which was then headed by Francisco L. Montejano.<ref name="EncMuc"/>

[[File:Calexico&MexicaliFromTheISS.jpg|thumb|Mexicali, seen from the [[International Space Station]], is situated south of the Mexico-US border]]
In the 20th century, the Colorado Riverland Company was dedicated to renting land here to farmers; however, these farmers were almost always foreigners, such as Chinese, East Indians and Japanese. The Mexicans were employed only as seasonal labor. This situation led to the agrarian conflict known as the "Asalto a las Tierras" (Assault on the Lands) in 1937.<ref name="EncMuc"/>

Agricultural production continued to increase during the 20th century. Cotton became the most important crop and with it developed the textile industry. In the early 1950s, the Mexicali Valley became the biggest cotton-producing zone in the whole country and in the 1960s, production reached more than half a million parcels a year. Currently, the valley still is one of Mexico's most productive agricultural regions, mostly producing wheat, cotton and vegetables.  The city of Mexicali is one of Mexico's most important exporter of asparagus, broccoli, carrots, green onions, lettuce, peas, peppers, radishes and tomatoes to the world.<ref name="bajaweb"/>

The government of the municipality was reorganized when the Baja California territory became the 29th state in 1953.<ref name="EncMuc"/>

===21st century===
Today Mexicali is an important center for industrial production in the automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, metallurgical, and health services as well as manufacturing and exporting products to various countries.<ref name="Mexicali History">{{cite web |title=Mexicali History |publisher=Trust for Mexicali Tourism |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mexicaliturismo.com%2Fesp%2Fpages%2Fmexicali.php%3Fidweb%3D1 |accessdate=March 10, 2011 }}</ref>

The [[2010 Baja California earthquake]] occurred at 15:40:40 local time (UTC-8), Sunday, April 4, 2010, reaching a magnitude of 7.2. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter of the quake struck 60&nbsp;km south-southeast of Mexicali.<ref Name="usgs">{{cite web | author = [[United States Geological Survey]] | url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/ci14607652.php|title=Magnitude 6.9 - Baja California, Mexico | date = April 4, 2010 | accessdate = April 4, 2010}}</ref> The quake was felt strongly in the northern regions of [[Baja California]] and the United States-Mexico border, and was also felt in western cities such as [[Tijuana]], [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]] and parts of Arizona.

==Geography==
The Mexicali Valley is one of the largest and most fertile valleys in Mexico.<ref name="Mexicali Economy">{{cite web |title=Economy |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mexicaliturismo.com%2Fesp%2Fpages%2Fmexicali.php%3Fidweb%3D7&act=url |accessdate=March 10, 2011 }}</ref> The Valley has over fifty different crops and is similar to the [[Imperial Valley]] in its agricultural production.

===Ecology===
The [[New River (Mexico <U+2013> United States)|New River]], which flows north to the State of California from Mexicali, is considered the most polluted river {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} in [[North America]]{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, containing toxic levels of lead and other heavy metals, {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} fecal bacteria {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, pathogens {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, and industrial waste {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Air pollution is also a problem during summer and winter months {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} with dust and other particulate levels exceeding healthy levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In spite of its arid desert location, Mexicali is watered through a system of aquifers in the valley. Under a 1944 water treaty, the city is "...guaranteed [an] annual quantity of {{convert|1,500,000|acre.ft|km3}} [of water] to be delivered..." from the [[Colorado River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crc.nv.gov/1944mexicanwatertreaty.htm |title=The Mexican Water Treaty: |publisher=Crc.nv.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> However, a proposed concrete lining in the United States on the All-American Canal would cut off billions of leaked gallons of water, which is used to irrigate onions, alfalfa, asparagus, squash and other crops in Mexicali.<ref>{{cite news |last= Archibold |first= Randal C. |publisher= The New York Times |title= Border Fight Focuses on Water, Not Immigration |date= July 7, 2006 |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/us/07border.html?scp=8&sq=mexicali&st=nyt |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref>

}}
Because of its low annual precipitation,  Mexicali has an [[arid climate]] (''BWh''). Under the criteria for the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]], Mexicali maintains desert climate temperatures every year. In October 12, 1932, the city experienced snowfall. Rainfall usually occurs in the winter months of December, January and February. Although summer is extremely dry in Mexicali, one of every two days there is an end moisture content. In July 1995, Mexicali experienced its highest ever recorded temperature of 52<U+00B0>C (125.6<U+00B0>F). In 2008, during the months of July and August there were several heavy thunderstorms that let down large amounts of rain and hail.  Summer rainfall in the city is infrequent. During winter time, Mexicali is affected by the snows that occur in the town of [[La Rumorosa]] located in the [[Sierra de Juarez]], about 45 minutes west of the city, causing decreases in temperature in the urban area lasting from two days to one week.

==Economy==
In its beginnings Mexicali was an important center for cotton production for export until synthetic fabrics reduced the worldwide demand for the fiber.

Currently horticulture is the most successful agricultural activity with scallion (green onion), and asparagus being among the most important crops. Cotton and wheat are still cultivated but with government price guarantees and subsidies making wheat farmer protests an annual event. There is an annual agribusiness fair in March drawing interested people from all over Mexico and the United States called [http://www.agrobaja.com Agrobaja].

The current prospects for economic growth in Mexicali rely on in-bond and assembly plants, mainly for export, including companies like, [[Selther]], [[Daewoo]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Honeywell]], [[Paccar]], [[Vitro]], [[Skyworks Solutions]], [[CareFusion]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Price Pfister]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]], [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]], [[Kenworth]] and [[Kwikset]]. Mexicali is also home to many food processing plants such as [[Nestl<U+00E9>]], [[Jumex]], [[Grupo Bimbo|Bimbo]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg]], and [[Sabritas]].

There are joint efforts on behalf of the Baja California government<ref>[http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx Baja California government]</ref> and the private sector to attract more companies to Mexicali based on a cluster strategy focusing on the regions' strengths of qualified labor, abundant energy and water supplies, a pro-business environment and its location on the California border.

Mexicali is considered among the most prosperous cities in Mexico,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} although US tourists can observe the level of poverty in rural villages surrounding the modern, upper-middle class enclave of Mexicali proper. There is recent research {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} that indicate a high level of disease prevalence {{citation needed|date=July 2012}} like respiratory illness,asthma,and other medical issues in the local inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}   The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] of 1994 that eliminated most trade restrictions between the two nations offers Mexicali an economic boom in the next decade.

===Silicon Border===
{{Main|Silicon Border}}
Silicon Border is a {{convert|40|km2|acre|adj=on}} development tailored to the specific needs of high-technology manufacturing and is situated in Mexicali, along the western border of the U.S. and Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconborder.com/semiconductors.html |title=Silicon Border |publisher=Silicon Border |date=2004-07-14 |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> The aim of the manufacturing park, which began in 2004, is to transform Mexicali into the world's next semiconductor manufacturing center. The Mexican federal and Baja California state governments have committed more than $2 million to the design and manufacturing of the project. Former President [[Vicente Fox]] has also offered 10 years of tax-free status to any firms that locate in the park and invest $1 billion or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/174336/partners_pushing_silicon_center/index.html |title=Partners Pushing 'Silicon' Center - Technology News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2005-07-14 |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref> Silicon Border<U+2019>s vision is to provide Mexico with an infrastructure that enables high-tech companies anywhere in the world to move manufacturing operations to the country and exploit its competitive advantages such as geographical location, human capital, research, legal and tax benefits, intellectual property, international treaties and logistics provided by the country for manufacturing high technology products while allowing research to develop processes, design, fabrication and testing able to compete with Asian operations and costs.<ref name="negocios.promexico.gob.mx">{{cite web|url=http://negocios.promexico.gob.mx/english/12-2009/art07.html |title=Pro Mexico |publisher=Negocios.promexico.gob.mx |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}</ref>

===Tourism===
[[Image:MexicaliBorderhmx.jpg|thumb|Cars crossing the border station from Mexicali-Calexico]] 
Mexicali also relies on tourism as a medium revenue, and visitors cross by foot or car from [[Calexico, California|Calexico]] in the United States every day. Restaurants and taco stands, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs are part of the draw for the city's tourists. Many shops and stalls selling Mexican crafts and souvenirs are also located in walking distance from the border.

Many residents from California, Arizona and Nevada look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, because they tend to be less expensive than those in the United States. Mexicali is home to several pharmacies marketed toward visitors from the United States. These pharmacies sell some pharmaceutical drugs without prescriptions and at much lower costs than pharmacies in the US. Many medications still require a doctor's prescription, although several accessible doctor offices are located near the border as well.

Mexico's drinking age of 18 (vs. 21 in the United States) makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college aged Southern Californians who tend to stay within the Calzadas Justo Sierra, Benito Juarez and Francisco L. Montejano.

Mexicali hosts [[Baja Prog]], one of the world's most important events in [[Progressive Rock]]. Since 1997, Baja Prog has been in the eyes of the world for being an event gathering the best acts of the progressive rock scene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Mexicali possesses a diversity of shopping venues and malls, the most visited being Plaza La Cachanilla, located just a few minutes away from the US border. The mall hosts a variety of shops, which sell a wide array of things, ranging from cheap Mexican curiosities to expensive imports. The Plaza La Cachanilla also represents a common place for people to socialize, especially during summer days when the weather reaches high temperatures, many families come and spend the day inside the air conditioned mall.

Just about everything for recreation can be found in Mexicali, including pool halls, bowling alleys, traditional cantinas, car clubs, full contact strip clubs, movie theaters, museums, a zoo, a state university, a convention center, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants.

The Galerias del Valle, anchored by [[WalMart]] Supercenter, 12-screen movie theater Cinepolis, two casinos, and a food court. Is located by Boulevard Lazaro Cardenas and Calle 11. The mall's food court contains such eateries including [[Carl's Jr.]], [[Applebee's]], [[Starbucks]], and [[Burger King]].

===Proposed Infrastructure===
Mexicali is located in a strategic location which puts it in line to benefit from two multi billion dollar infrastructure projects if they go forward. These are a hydro-engineering project and the [[Punta Colonet]] port project. The hydro-engineering project is the renovation of a Canal connecting the [[Gulf of California]] with [[Laguna Salada]] south west of Mexicali or construction of a new canal direct to Mexicali. The water project would then connect by pipe or canal further to the [[Salton Sea]] in California. The water project would supply the area with sea water for [[desalination]] and hydro electric power. The second proposed project Punta Colonet would connect Mexicali by rail with a deep water container port on the western side of the Baja California peninsula.

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Municipality of Mexicali#Boroughs}}
The municipality of Mexicali is divided into 1 city area and 14 administrative boroughs of which the city of Mexicali occupies 3 beside the city area.

=== Chinatown, Mexicali ===
{{Main|Chinatown, Mexicali}}
[[Image:AmistadPagodaMexicali.JPG|thumb|Monument to the Chinese Community in Friendship Square]]
The city claims to have the largest per capita concentration of residents of Chinese origin, around 5,000. While this does not compare to U.S. cities like [[San Francisco]] or [[New York]]. The [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese immigrants]] came to the area as laborers for the Colorado River Land Company, an American enterprise which designed and built an extensive irrigation system in the Valley of Mexicali. Some immigrants came from the United States, often fleeing anti-Chinese policies there, while others sailed directly from China. Thousands of Chinese were lured to the area by the promise of high wages, but for most that never materialised.<ref name="CPA">{{cite web |last= Cummings |first= Joe |url=http://www.cpamedia.com/history/sharks_fin_tacos/ |title= Mexicali's Chinatown: Sharks fin Tacos and Barbecued Chow Mein |accessdate=2008-10-25 }}</ref>

Since 2000, new migrants from China to Mexicali come from many of the same areas as
before 1960, with perhaps 90% from Guangdong or Hong Kong.<ref>Auy<U+00F3>n Gerardo, Eduardo.  2003.  El drag<U+00F3>n en el desierto: los pioneros chinos en Mexicali.

The city itself had a 2005 census population of 653,046, whereas the [[municipality of Mexicali|municipality]]'s population was 895,962. It is the 13th largest municipality in Mexico as of the Census 2005 with population estimates exceeding one million alone. The population is constantly growing due to the number of [[Maquiladoras]] in the area, lack of urban planning, and migrational aspects, like seasonal labor and the constant in-and-out flow of immigrants to the U.S. or into Mexico.

==Environment==
A study by Instituto Mexicano de la Competitividad has listed Mexicali as Mexico's most polluted air of large cities, with a [[PM10]] rating of 137 for the year 2010.<ref>http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n3172249.htm</ref>  It is thought that the reason is lack of pavement (dust) and lack of wind, especially in summer.  No information for PM5 or [[PM2.5]] was given.  [[Monterrey]], [[Cuernavaca]], and [[Tijuana]] rounded up the highest PM10 list in the study.

The ''Bomberos de Mexicali'' were founded in 2010 and participate in the Pacific Coast Basketball Circuit, CIBACOPA.  The team demonstrated strong results in the first leg of its inaugural season, yet was negatively affected by the April 4th earthquake of the Mexicali region, seeing its second leg play out as a road team in Tijuana<U+2019>s Municipal Auditorium.  Due to the earthquake and its aftershocks, the Civil Protection Ministry of Mexicali ceased all massive events within closed structures.  The Bomberos look to return in 2011 with reinforcements and a competitive team that will vie for the league title.  Bomberos arrived to Mexicali and reached an agreement with the Municipal Government to renovate the hardwood of the Mexicali Gymnasium and call the Silver Colossus their home.

==Infrastructure==
[[Image:RailTracksMexicali.JPG|thumb|upright|Rail tracks on Avenida Lopez Mateos leading north to the border crossing.]]

===Transportation===

====Land====
Mexicali is located at a Junction of major interstates and federal highways. These include [[Interstate 8]], leading from [[San Diego, California]] to the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]] where the cities of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] dominate, [[Mexican Federal Highway 2|Federal Highway 2]], which leads east to [[San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora]] and west to [[Tijuana]], and [[Mexican Federal Highway 5|Federal Highway 5]] connecting San Felipe with Mexicali. Other roads lead southwest to [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] or north to the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]].

The road system in the city of Mexicali and its conurbation is very complex. Over the urban area long boulevards are traversed from one end of which most are 6 lanes with a median of 2 lanes. The backbone of the city is the Lazaro Cardenas Boulevard extending from east to west. This boulevard is 24.5&nbsp;km long and consists of 6 lanes (3 each direction), a shoulder in each direction, and ridges of 3 lanes creating a wingspan of 50 meters. In certain sections the boulevard is made of 8 to 10 lanes. Other important boulevards include: Adolfo Lopez Mateos, Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez, An<U+00E1>huac, Justo Sierra, Venustiano Carranza, Manuel G<U+00F3>mez Morin, Francisco L. Montejano, Cetys, H<U+00E9>ctor Ter<U+00E1>n Ter<U+00E1>n, Independencia and Heroico Colegio Militar, among others. There are two corridors within the city: New River Ecological Corridor, which is guided in the ancient New River bed, and the Palaco Industrial Corridor,<ref>Palaco Industrial Corridor</ref> this crosses the southern Industrial zone of Mexicali. There is also the beltway, located in the east of the city, connecting the Lazaro Cardenas Blvd. with Islas Agrarias Blvd.<ref>Islas Agrarias</ref> and the road to Colonia Abasolo,<ref>Colonia Abasolo</ref> and this in turn with the Airport Road.

Within the urban area there are vehicular bridges, like the L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas-Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez Blvds. underpass, H<U+00E9>ctor Ter<U+00E1>n Ter<U+00E1>n-San Felipe Hwy underpass, Adolfo L<U+00F3>pez Mateos-Independencia Bridge, and L<U+00E1>zaro C<U+00E1>rdenas-Adolfo Lopez Mateos Distributor. The latter has a 15-m high bridge which makes it the highest in northwestern Mexico. It was also designed with first-world seismic technology, which supports earthquakes of similar magnitude as 7.2 degrees Richter of the day April 4, 2010.

The road layout in the urban sprawl is very efficient.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Many communities are portrayed by satellite imagery as rectangular while many streets are straight and wide, maintaining standard deviations with few bends.

On 6 January 2011 at a press conference, the city of Mexicali, led by Francisco Jos<U+00E9> P<U+00E9>rez-Tejada Padilla, along with the state governor Jos<U+00E9> Guadalupe Osuna Mill<U+00E1>n, unveiled the modernized Palaco Industrial Corridor. This project will be the largest and most expensive in the history of road infrastructure in Mexicali with an initial investment of 285 million pesos and 546 million more for the installation of the Express Line 1 (Fast Transportation bus line), with a total investment of 831 million pesos. The new Palaco Industrial Corridor began constructions in March 2011, with 6 lanes and berms at the edges that included two additional lanes to service the BRT. Its opening was planned on Wednesday, March 14, 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Metropolitan transit===
In the past 10 years, the public transport system has greatly improved with the implementation of modern units for the convenience of users. Currently there are over 40 routes across the city and its urban area, where companies like Atusa, Getusmex, among others, offer this service. The fees for bus service marked by the Municipal Transportation System are:
*Modern service unit with A/C: 11.00 pesos
*Standard service unit without A/C: 6.50 pesos

====Air====
The city is linked to other Mexican cities by the [[General Rodolfo S<U+00E1>nchez Taboada International Airport|Mexicali International Airport]], which serve the city and the surrounding towns.

====Sea====
The proposed canal linking the Gulf of California with Mexicali, by way of Laguna Salada, would provide sea transportation to and from the Gulf from other important west coast cities and regional inland centers such as [[San Diego]], [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].
