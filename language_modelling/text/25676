Chinese legend has it that '''money tree''' is a kind of holy tree, which can bring money and fortune to the people, and that it is a symbol of affluence, nobility and auspiciousness. It can be traced back to the primitive society when the adoration of holy tree was prevalent. Whilst Money trees may be derived from the Sun tree myth associated with paradise the coins link paradise with a material bounty in this world<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Qyz5I7fi4PQC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=money+tree+in+myth+%2B+chineses&source=bl&ots=ZxFK10lPII&sig=M9SPFkvnf_9uAma81ZjlpgYQATw&hl=en&ei=8e8OSsK8AZWUjAeMpvm4Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3</ref>.There also exists a holy tree named [[Hibiscus rosa-sinensis|Chinese Hibiscus]] in [[Chinese mythology]]. According to the existing historical materials, the concept "money tree" is derived at the latest from the [[Han Dynasty]]<ref>http://history.cultural-china.com/en/55History619.html</ref>. Cast bronze money trees are a conspicuous feature of Han tombs in Sichuan<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=Qyz5I7fi4PQC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=money+tree+in+myth+%2B+chineses&source=bl&ots=ZxFK10lPII&sig=M9SPFkvnf_9uAma81ZjlpgYQATw&hl=en&ei=8e8OSsK8AZWUjAeMpvm4Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3</ref>.

==Myths and folk tales==
===Folktales===
One folk tale tells of a sculptor who placed fake money on a tree in order to trick villagers into cutting it down for him. But so many people believed the tree to be sacred that it became sacred and the sculptor is warned that if he cuts down or harms the tree he will be cursed. At the end of the story the sculptor is bribed not to harm the tree.<ref>http://chinesefolktales.blogspot.com/2009/03/ghost-stories-from-ancient-china-series.html</ref>

===The underworld===
It was thought the coins emitted light, the coins guided the deceased, who would ride on a winged ram up the ceramic mountain to the bronze tree of paradise. These coins could also be plucked for needs on the journey from earth to the realm of immortals<ref>http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/tao/resource_art/pdf/china_money_tree.pdf</ref>.

==Chinese New Year==
The Money tree regains popularity during the Chinese New Year. According to custom, money trees are made of a bushy pine or cypress branch nestled inside a porcelain pot filled with rice grains. Melon seeds and pine nuts are sprinkled over the top of the rice. Decorating the branches are gold and silver coin garlands made of paper. Symbols of long life (including paper cranes and deer) also embellish the tree, which is usually topped by the genie of wealth, Liu Hai, or the character for happiness.<ref>http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/tao/resource_art/pdf/china_money_tree.pdf</ref>
In Malaysia the Chinese put out Money Trees on the second day of the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.<ref>http://www.malaysiasite.nl/newyear.htm</ref>
