The '''1st Split Partisan Detachment''' ({{lang-sh-Latn|Prvi splitski partizanski odred}}) or the '''1st Split Detachment''' ({{lang-sh-Latn|Prvi splitski odred|links=no}}) was a [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] unit composed of volunteers from the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] during [[World War II]]. It was created in August 1941, just four months after the [[World War II in Yugoslavia|occupation of Yugoslavia]], and the [[annexation]] of Split and most of [[Dalmatia]] by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The unit, composed mostly of young men with little or no fighting experience, planned to relocate to the [[Dinara]] mountains to join other Partisan units in fighting [[Axis powers|Axis forces]].

After initial organizational problems, the weakened detachment reached an area near the village of [[Ko<U+0161>ute]] where they were engaged by [[Usta<U+0161>e Militia]] backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the detachment began retreating. In the end, the Partisans suffered four [[killed in action]] and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three of the prisoners were later executed by firing squad.

== Background ==
The [[Axis powers]] began their [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] on 6 April 1941. Just four days later, the [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang=sh-Latn|Nezavisna Dr<U+017E>ava Hrvatska|links=no}} <U+2013> NDH) was declared, encompassing the territory of present day [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Serbia]]. In accordance with the [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|Treaties of Rome]] signed by the [[Usta<U+0161>e]] leadership of the NDH, a large part of Croatian coastline and islands, including the cities of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Rijeka]], were to be incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. The low morale of Yugoslav troops in Split and the uncontested advance of the Italian Army through Dalmatia resulted in a number desertions. Paramilitary formations of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] disarmed soldiers, and by 11 April, there were no organized military formations in Split, and a large number of police and [[gendarmerie]] had switched their allegiance to the NDH. With Split under the control of the new Usta<U+0161>e government, the authorities apprehended 300 citizens who they deemed to be political enemies. On 13 April, members of the [[League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia]] ({{lang-hr-Latn|Savez komunisti<U+010D>ke omladine Jugoslavije|links=no}}, SKOJ) broke in to a number of Usta<U+0161>e weapons depots, stealing dozens of rifles and machine guns, as well as ammunition and hand grenades.{{sfn|Leonti<U+0107>|1960|p=42}}

On the evening of 15 April, the first troops of the Italian Army entered Split, signifying the start of their occupation. On 21 April, the civil control of Split was passed from the NDH to Italian authorities followed by the raising of the Italian flag. On 18 May, the Kingdom of Italy and the NDH signed the Treaties of Rome, confirming Italian rule of Dalmatia, including Split.{{sfn|Leonti<U+0107>|1960|p=43}}

== History ==
=== Formation ===
On 7 August 1941, Pavle Pap-<U+0160>ilja and Mirko Kova<U+010D>evi<U+0107>-Lala arrived in Split with instructions from the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr-Latn|Centralni komitet komunisti<U+010D>ke partije Hrvatske|links=no}}) to discuss forming Partisan detachments to fight the Axis occupiers. In a meeting with the members of the Regional Committee they agreed that the area of operations of the new resistance detachments should be the Dinara mountains where their fighters could rely on support from the population of the Sinj and [[Livanjsko field]] regions as well as other Partisan formations in [[Bosanska Krajina]] and [[Lika]]. The main problem with the plan was the time needed to organize the detachments and relocate them to the Dinara mountains. Moving to their new fighting areas meant crossing the rough terrain of [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]], whose population was not supportive of the Partisans. Despite these issues, it was decided that in the next two days the Regional Committee would form seven Partisan detachments, including one from Split.{{sfn|Leonti<U+0107>|1960|p=51}}{{sfn|Kuzmi<U+0107>|2010|p=45}}

According to the initial plan, on the night of 11 August, the Split Detachment was to move just outside of Split and collect weapons that had been captured on 13 April. They would then link up with the Solin Detachment and continue towards [[Kame<U+0161>nica, Koprivnica-Kri<U+017E>evci County|Kame<U+0161>nica]], and from there to [[Otok, Split-Dalmatia County|Otok]] to meet with the Sinj Detachment. On 8 August, a meeting of Communist Party members and sympathisers was held in a field house between Split and [[Stobre<U+010D>]] to ask for volunteers for joining the detachment. The Split Detachment was formed on 11 August, consisting of 66 members organized in three [[platoon]]s. The detachment left Split during the same day, commanded by <U+0110>ordano Borov<U+010D>i<U+0107>-Kurir and [[commissar]] Alfred Santini, and accompanied by Mirko Kova<U+010D>evi<U+0107>-Lala who was in command of all Partisan detachments in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Kuzmi<U+0107>|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Splitski heroji}}

=== Ambush and aftermath===
The Split Detachment encountered a problem when the 2nd Platoon got lost and missed a rendezvous with the 1st and 3rd Platoon which were waiting for them near [[Mravince]]. The 2nd Platoon was therefore disbanded while the rest of the detachment continued via [[Mosor]] to [[Dicmo]] where they were to meet up with their guides. They arrived on the night of 12 August, and upon realizing their guides weren't there, decided to continue alone towards Kame<U+0161>nica. On the dawn of 13 August, after a night of wandering after getting lost, the detachment, now without any supplies, camped near the village of Kru<U+0161>var. In the evening they once again continued towards Kame<U+0161>nica, and at dawn on 14 August, they camped near the village of Ko<U+0161>ute, near [[Trilj]]. Borov<U+010D>i<U+0107> tasked two fighters to go to the village and ask the locals for water and directions. After talking to some locals, the fighters were fired upon by a member of the Usta<U+0161>e militia from the village. They returned fire and continued back to their camp notifying the others about the incident.{{sfn|Kvesi<U+0107>|1960|pp=135<U+2013>136}}{{sfn|Splitski heroji}}

Just as they finished their report, the detachment came under fire from the Usta<U+0161>e militia that had gathered in the village and located the Partisans. The Usta<U+0161>e called for help from Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the detachment, engaging them with [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and light [[artillery]]. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening when they planned to retreat using the cover of dark. About 20:00, Mirko Kova<U+010D>evi<U+0107>-Lala, one of the most experienced members of the detachment, was killed after being hit by a mortar round, his death having a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borov<U+010D>i<U+0107>'s order to retreat soon turned into chaos, as individuals fled the area.{{sfn|Kvesi<U+0107>|1960|pp=137<U+2013>138}}{{sfn|Splitski heroji}}

Four Partisans died in the fighting, while another three were summarily shot after capture. Twenty-five were captured and taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. The 25 that were captured were moved to Sinj where one of the prisoners died after being beaten up, and the rest were placed on trial before a special court that was sent from [[Mostar]]. Three prisoners were acquitted while the remaining 21 were taken to Rudu<U+0161>a near Sinj, and executed by a [[firing squad]].{{sfn|Splitski heroji}}

== Commemoration ==
After the war, the 1st Split Partisan Detachment was honored with a monument and a [[State school|public school]] was named after Borov<U+010D>i<U+0107>. In 1962, a monument was erected in Rudu<U+0161>a where the captured members of the detachment were executed. The monument was renovated in 2009 with financial aid from the owners of the [[RNK Split]] football club, as several members of the detachment were footballers playing for RNK Split at the time.{{sfn|Rudu<U+0161>a: Bra<U+0107>a <U+017D>u<U+017E>ul obnovila partizanski spomenik}}
