'''Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen''' ([[11 March]] [[1965]] in [[London]]) is an [[England|English]] [[interior design]]er and [[television]] personality best known for his appearances on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] [[television program|television programme]] ''[[Changing Rooms (TV show)|Changing Rooms]]''. He is noted for his flamboyant personality and for affecting a [[dandy]]ish appearance. He is sometimes credited as "Laurence Llewelyn Bowen" [http://www.bbc.co.uk/homes/design/lighting_llbtips.shtml], and the components of his name are frequently misspelled "Llewellyn" [http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/10_october/07/changingrooms_laurence.shtml] and/or "Lawrence" [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/3982013.stm].

Educated at [[Alleyn's School]] in Dulwich, Laurence graduated from the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] in [[1986]] with a [[Fine Art]] [[academic degree|degree]]. He subsequently worked for the Harefield Group of Companies and the interior design firm Peter Leonard Associates. In [[1989]] he started his own design consultancy. His wife Jackie, an author, had heard through her agent that a production company was searching for a designer and in [[1996]] he appeared on the first episode of ''[[Changing Rooms (TV show)|Changing Rooms]]''. He and his wife have two daughters.

He has also presented a three-part BBC special ''Taste'' (2002), about the history of interior design, and in autumn 2005 (sic) he began presenting the weekly BBC1 travel show ''Holiday 2006''. His books include ''Fantasy Rooms: Inspirational Designs from the BBC Series'' (1999), ''Display'' (2001), ''"Home Front": Inside Out'' (2002), ''Design Rules'' (2003) and ''A Pinch of Posh'' (2006) co-written with his wife, Jackie. He has also made a guest appearance on ''Changing Rooms''' American counterpart, ''[[Trading Spaces]]''.

In March 2005 he starred in a one-off [[mockumentary]] as a prospective candidate for [[British Parliament|Parliament]]. His party, the Purple Party, "[[lobbying|lobbied]]" for a restoration of Britain's [[Cultural heritage|heritage]], and several extreme [[architecture|architectural]] measures such as tearing down all buildings that did not conform to their surroundings.

In January 2006, he and his wife Jackie were offered a place on the [[Valentine's Day]] celebrity couples edition of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''. They appeared on the show managing to reach the <U+00A3>1 million question, before answering wrongly and losing <U+00A3>468,000. For the first time ever, [[Celador]] let Laurence and his wife retry the show after the company claimed that the last question "didn't meet their standards". After returning and being shown a different <U+00A3>1 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing <U+00A3>468,000 for the second time, and won <U+00A3>500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Foundation, of which Laurence and his wife are both patrons. This amount is the highest that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''. The allegedly misleading question was "Translated from the [[Latin language|Latin]], what is the [[United States]] motto?". The answer given was "[[In God we trust]]" which is original English and has in fact been the US motto since 1956. The intended answer had been "Out of many, one" which is a translation of the Latin phrase ''[[E Pluribus Unum]]'', which is not actually the current [[United States]] motto.

He is known as "Larry" to his friends, in homage to his great hero [[Laurence Olivier]].
