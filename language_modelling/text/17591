Stewart attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] and was drafted 60th in the [[1995 NFL draft]] by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Playing for [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] in 1994 he completed a [[hail mary pass]] to beat the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] 27-26, a play known as "[[The Miracle at Michigan]]."

==Early life and high school years==
Stewart was born in New Orleans and raised in Marrero, Louisiana, where his father Robert Stewart, Sr. and older brother Robert, Jr. own a [[barber|barber shop]].<ref name="pittsburghlive.com">http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_15549.html</ref>

Stewart's mother died from [[lung cancer]] when Stewart was 10 years old.<ref name="pittsburghlive.com"/> As a result, Stewart wore number 10 throughout his playing career in high school, college, and the NFL as a tribute to his mom and became an anti-smoking advocate. With the Steelers, Stewart's number 10 was previously worn by [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Roy Gerela]] during the team's dynasty years in the 1970s. Later, the number was worn by quarterback [[Scott Campbell (American football)|Scott Campbell]] from 1984 to 1986. From 2006 to 2010, the number was worn by [[wide receiver]] [[Santonio Holmes]]. In 2010, quarterback [[Dennis Dixon]] reclaimed his college number when Holmes was traded to the [[New York Jets]].

Stewart attended [[John Ehret High School]] in Marrero,LA and lettered in football. As a junior, he passed for 1,645 yards and 19 touchdowns. As a senior, he passed for 942 yards and 17 touchdowns and ran for another 923 yards and 23 touchdowns, and was named Louisiana's Most Valuable Player and the New Orleans Player of the Year.

During his senior year in high school, Kordell predicted that he would one day be the quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Stewart has a younger stepbrother named Raymond Degree who also played football in college.

==College career==
In 1991, Stewart attended the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. Playing under coach [[Bill McCartney]], he would become one of the most prolific quarterbacks in school history, setting several [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Buffaloes]] records, including most completed passes, most passing yards, and most touchdown passes.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cubuffs.com/pdf5/47598.pdf?SPSID=62928&SPID=255&DB_OEM_ID=600 | title=Colorado Football Individual Records}}</ref>

Stewart led the Buffaloes single back/two TE pro-style attack to an 11-1 record and a top-3 finish in the [[AP Poll|AP]] and [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] polls in 1994, as well as wins in the 1993 [[Aloha Bowl]] and [[1995 Fiesta Bowl]]. He was selected as a second team [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] his senior year.

On September 24, 1994, Stewart threw a game-winning, 76-yard [[hail mary pass]] to [[Michael Westbrook]] in the closing seconds to beat the [[1994 Michigan Wolverines football team|University of Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=2896389 | title=Stewart to Westbrook silenced Big House crowd | author=Ivan Maisel | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2007-06-07 | accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref>

==NFL career==
===1997===
Stewart got his chance to start at quarterback in 1997. In his first season as a starting quarterback in the NFL, he led the Steelers to an 11&ndash;5 record and the AFC Championship Game.

===1998&ndash;1999===
Prior to the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]], the Steelers lost their offensive coordinator, [[Chan Gailey]]. To replace him, the Steelers brought in [[Ray Sherman]] from the Vikings. In addition, Stewart's leading receiver and Pro Bowler [[Yancey Thigpen]] also left via free agency after the 1997 season. By mid-season in 1998, the Steelers had lost three of the five starting offensive linemen from the 1997 AFC Championship game and, as a result, Stewart and the Steelers offense struggled against the Denver Broncos.

===2000===
Coach Bill Cowher named [[Kent Graham]] quarterback to start the [[2000 NFL season|season]], and the team got off to a 1&ndash;3 start. When Graham injured his hip, Stewart was tapped to replace him. The [[2000 Pittsburgh Steelers season|team]] finished 9&ndash;7 and barely missed the playoffs.

===2001===
As starting quarterback, Stewart led the [[2001 Pittsburgh Steelers|2001 Steelers]] to a 13&ndash;3 regular-season record and the top seed in the [[2001-02 NFL playoffs|AFC playoffs]]. Under the tutelage of new QB coach [[Tom Clements]] and new offensive coordinator [[Mike Mularkey]], Stewart had his best year as a pro, throwing for over 3,000 yards, completing 60 percent of his passes, and attaining a [[passer rating]] of 81.7. He threw for 14 TDs and ran for 5 more. Stewart was elected to the Pro Bowl and was named the Steelers MVP. 

The Steelers easily defeated the then-defending Super Bowl champion [[2001 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] in the divisional playoffs. The eventual [[2002 Super Bowl|Super Bowl]] champion [[2001 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] defeated the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game.

===2002===
Stewart began the 2002 season as the Steelers' starting quarterback, but after throwing an interception into double coverage in the end zone at home against the Cleveland Browns in the third game of the season, he was replaced by increasingly popular backup [[Tommy Maddox]], and Stewart was released at the end of the season. Stewart did, however, keep the team's playoff hopes alive in his final appearance.

===2003&ndash;2005===
The following season, Stewart signed as a free agent with the [[Chicago Bears]] and was named the starter. After several poor performances in [[2003 NFL season|2003]], he was replaced in favor of [[Chris Chandler]]. After getting the same results from Chandler, he was reinserted as the starter, before getting benched in favor of rookie [[Rex Grossman]] after the Bears were eliminated from the playoffs. Stewart was released at the end of the season. Stewart was signed in [[2004 NFL season|2004]] by the Ravens to play a backup role to [[Kyle Boller]], and later served as a replacement for the injured [[Anthony Wright (quarterback)|Anthony Wright]]. However, he did not throw a pass that season. He was unexpectedly successful as an emergency replacement for [[punter (football position)|punter]] [[Dave Zastudil]], being named NFL Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance. He was released following the 2004 season, but due to an injury to starting quarterback Kyle Boller during Week 1 of the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the Ravens once again signed Stewart to be a backup to [[Anthony Wright (quarterback)|Anthony Wright]].

===Nickname===
Pittsburgh Steelers color commentator [[Myron Cope]] gave Stewart the [[nickname]] "Slash" due to his abilities as a utility player able to play other positions such as [[running back]] / [[wide receiver]] / [[Punter (American football)|punter]] / returner.

After confining him to many utility roles during the 1995 season, when the Steelers made it to [[Super Bowl XXX]] only to lose to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], the team gave Stewart the opportunity to compete for the starting quarterback position in 1996. Following a preseason battle, Bill Cowher named [[Jim Miller (quarterback)|Jim Miller]] as the Steelers' starting quarterback and kept Stewart in his "Slash" role. Miller struggled at Jacksonville on opening day and was replaced by [[Mike Tomczak]] for the rest of the season. In a December 1996 game against the [[1996 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], Stewart set an NFL record for longest touchdown run by a quarterback with an 80-yard rush.

==Post-NFL life==
Following Boller's reactivation on Wednesday, November 9, 2005, the Ravens cut Stewart instead of keeping him as a third-string player, activating running back [[Musa Smith]] instead. Stewart had no comment following the low-key announcement he had been cut from the team.

Stewart made guest appearances on the TV shows ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'' and ''[[Pros vs. Joes]]''.

On April 29, 2008, in an interview on the WCNN 680 "The Fan," Stewart expressed interest in returning to the NFL. Also, according to [[ESPN2]]'s [[First Take]] on July 28, 2008, Stewart had not officially retired and had been working out at his home, to attempt a comeback during following pre-season.

He appeared in January 2009 as analyst on [[ESPN]]'s [[College Football Live]], and then later appeared again in July during the show's "50 States Tour" for the show's episode regarding Colorado athletics. Stewart is currently an analyst for NFL post-game coverage for ESPNEWS.

Kordell will be a sideline reporter for the newly-formed [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]].

==Personal life==
Stewart has a son named Syre. He now resides in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Stewart is also an avid golfer. In 1998, he was featured as a guest on the popular Nickelodeon game show "Figure it Out!"<ref>http://dc-lundberg.net/gstradepost/eh.html</ref>
