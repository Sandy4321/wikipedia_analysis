'''Sparrow Lake''' is a [[lake]] located in the south-central region of the Province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is situated north-west of the town of [[Orillia]] and south of the town of [[Gravenhurst, Ontario]] and approximately 150 kilometres and a 1.5 hour drive north of the [[Greater Toronto Area]].
Sparrow Lake is the most southerly lake in the popular [[Muskoka]] tourist region. 

It is also slightly famous as being the northern setting for the Showcase tv show [[Paradise Falls]]. Various settings and lodges around the lake were used for filming.


==Geography==
This small, shallow, fresh body of water is a part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] [http://www.trentsevern.com], a series of rivers, lakes and canals running southwest from Severn Sound on the eastern shore of [[Lake Huron]]'s [[Georgian Bay]], up the [[Severn River]], through [[Lake Couchiching]], [[Lake Simcoe]] and the [[Kawartha Lakes]] and down the [[Trent River]] across south-central Ontario to the northern shore of [[Lake Ontario]]. 

The lake is approximately 7 kilometres in length and between 1 and 2 kilometres in width, with a maximum depth of approximately 12 metres and an average depth of approximately 4 metres. The main inflow and outflow is the Severn River, which in turn drains the Lake Simcoe, Lake Couchiching and [[Black River]] watersheds.  Other inflows are the Kahshe River ([[Kahshe Lake]]/Gartersnake) and the Beaver Creek watersheds.  

Situated on the southern edge of the [[Canadian Shield]], the lake is spotted with granite islands and surrounded by rocky, well-treed shorelines.  Shoreline development consists mainly of road-access recreational cottage properties with several resorts and full-service marinas accessible by road and water.  

==Flaura and fauna==
The lake is considered quite productive in terms of aquatic plants and fish, with nutrient values being towards the higher end of the [[mesotrophic]] range.
