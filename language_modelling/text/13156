{{Constitutional history of Canada}}
The '''Letters Patent, 1947''' (more formally, the '''Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada''') are a legal instrument introduced by King [[George VI]], which came into effect on 1 October 1947 and continue to, along with parts of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], constitute the Office of the Governor General. These letters served to expand the role and powers of the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] in exercising the [[Royal prerogative#Canada|Royal Prerogative]], allowing the governor general to carry out an increased number of the King's duties in "exceptional circumstances".<ref>{{cite book| title=Letter to Sir Allan Lascelles from Prime Minister Mackenzie King| date=5 May 1947| publisher=Library and Archives Canada| last=King| first=William Lyon Mackenzie| authorlink= William Lyon Mackenzie King| year=1947| location=Ottawa}}</ref> While the letters patent empower the governor general to exercise most of the "powers and authorities" lawfully belonging to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=3| last=Office of the Governor General of Canada| title=The Governor General > Role and Responsibilities| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> these powers and responsibilities remain with the Queen and are carried out on her behalf.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1286995575842/1296756955930| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=The Role and Responsibilities of the Governor General| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=13 October 2010| accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://canadiancrown.gc.ca/eng/1331826580130/1335291215281| last=Government of Canada| title=Crown in Canada > The Crown > The Governor General| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=1 June 2012| accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref>

==Historical context==
[[File:Letters Patent 1947 page1.png|thumb|left|alt=Letters Patent 1947|First page of the proclamation of the 1947 Letters Patent as published in the [[Canada Gazette]]]] 
The first letters patent were issued for Canada by the [[List of French monarchs|Kings of France]] to their governors of New France, starting in 1663.<ref>{{cite book | title=Canada Under Louis XIV, 1633-1701 | publisher=McClelland and Stewart | author=Eccles, W.J. | year=1964 | location=Toronto |pages=27}}</ref> At this time, the letters patent, outlining the office of governor and its role, were issued with an accompanying commission appointing the occupant of the office, as well as royal instructions. In this way, a different set of letters patent were issued by the Crown each time a new governor was appointed, a custom that was continued by the British following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|surrender of New France]] to the United Kingdom in 1763. This system remained largely unchanged until 1947, with the exception of the granting of the title ''commander-in-chief'' to the governor general in 1905 and the change from the governor general as an agent of the British government to the representative of the Canadian Crown in 1931.<ref name=McCreery /> 

The experiences of the [[Iceland|Kingdom of Iceland]] during the Second World War also gave [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Louis St. Laurent]] an example of how the lack of a regency act or similar mechanism could, in certain circumstances, evoke a constitutional crisis. When Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, Iceland found itself in the peculiar position wherein its king, [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]], who was also king of and resided in Denmark, was effectively cut off and unable to perform his duties such as passing bills and exercising the royal prerogative in Iceland. With no method to allow for the incapacity of the sovereign, the Icelandic parliament was forced into passing an illegal declaration of independence, with the appointment of [[Sveinn Bj<U+00F6>rnsson]] as regent.<ref>{{cite book | title=Rising of Seasons: Iceland - Its Culture and History |publisher=University of Michigan Press | author=Lacey, T.G. | year=1998 | location=Ann Arbor | pages=130}}</ref> The subject of the Canadian governor general's authorities in the absence of the monarch vis-<U+00E0>-vis the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Regency Acts#Acts currently in force governing the establishment of a Regency|Regency Act]] was brought up in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] in 1947, further underscoring the need for such a mechanism within the Canadian political structure. The issuance of the 1947 Letters Patent later that year allowed the governor general to carry out nearly all of the sovereign's duties in case of capture or incapacity and negated the need for [[Government of Canada|His Majesty's Canadian government]] to go through the process of passing legislation equivalent to the Regency Act.<ref name=McCreery>{{Citation | last =McCreery | first =Christopher | title =The Evolving Canadian Crown |place = Montreal and Kingston |publisher =McGill-Queen's University Press | year =2012 | chapter =Myth and Misunderstanding: The Origins and Meaning of the Letters Patent Constituting the Office of the Governor General, 1947 | pages =38-52 | isbn =978-1-55339-202-6}}</ref>

==Implementation== 
While the governor general is authorized by the Queen to exercise the authority of the Crown, only the Queen can revoke, alter, or amend the 1947 letters patent.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/001060/f2/1940/cgc_p2-0_v081_n012_t002_000_19471001_p00000.pdf| last=George VI| authorlink=George VI| title=Letters Patent Constituting the Office of Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of Canada| journal=The Canada Gazette| loc=S. XV| date=1 October 1947| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Further, unlike other parts of the constitution, the letters patent are a creation of the monarch's Royal Perogative, and cannot be repealed by parliament.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Donovan.pdf| last=Donovan| first=Davis S.| title=The Governor General and Lieutenant Governors: Canada's Misunderstood Viceroys| page=5| date=27 May 2009| publisher=Canadian Political Science Association| accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref> In addition, there is no legal impediment to the Queen exercising her powers herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html#h-3 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=March 29, 1867 | accessdate=September 03, 2012| page=s.9}}</ref><ref name=heard>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/324/Independence.html | title=Independance|publisher=Simon Fraser University | date=1990 |accessdate=September 03, 2012 | author=Heard, Andrew}}</ref> Finally, the Letters Patent 1947 would not be sufficient to effect such a dramatic change as a transfer of power from the Queen to the governor general, as any changes to the role of the Queen or of the governor general are subject to the amending formula provided in section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-56 | title=Constitution Act, 1982 |publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada |date=April 17, 1982 | accessdate=September 03, 2012 | page=s.41}}</ref> For example, the position of [[Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces|Commander-in-Chief]] while expressly delegated to the governor general in the Letters Patent, cannot be construed as a complete abdication of this role by the Queen, as any change of this position would require a constitutional amendment of section 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867.<ref name=heard /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-1.html#h-3 |title=Constitution Act, 1867 | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | date=March 29, 1867 | accessdate=September 03, 2012 |page=s.15}}</ref>

==Misconceptions==
While the Letters Patent of 1947 are often portrayed as being a radical departure from previous practices, they are in reality remarkably similar to previous letters patent, above all those of 1931. At the time, it was remarked that "there seems to be no change in the status of governor-general", and that the governor general "still remains an officer to whom his Majesty has committed extensive but definite powers and functions."<ref name= Schuster>{{cite journal | title=The Office of Governor-General in Canada | author=MacKenzie King, W.L.; Schuster, W.P. |journal=University of Toronto Law Journal | year=1948 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=474-483}}</ref> The intent behind the letters patent was never to alter the existing practice where certain matters were always referred to the sovereign and not to the governor general, but to redraft the 1931 Letters Patent into a Canadian document empowering the governor general by way of "enabling legislation".<ref>{{cite book | title=Manual of Official Procedure of the Government of Canada | publisher=Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada | author=Her Majesty's Privy Council Office | year=1968 (ed 2010) | location=Ottawa | pages=140}}</ref> Prime Minister Mackenzie King wrote to the King stating that "unless exceptional circumstances made it necessary to do so, it was not proposed by the Canadian Government to alter existing practices without prior consultation or notification to the Governor General and the King".<ref>{{cite book|title= Letter to Sir Allan Lascelles, Private Secretary to the King from W.L. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada, 7 August 1947|publisher=Library and Archives Canada | author=William Lyon Mackenzie King | authorlink= William Lyon Mackenzie King | year=1947|location=Ottawa}}</ref> Even many years after the implementation of the letters patent, a variety of matters continue to be submitted exclusively to the Sovereign such as the granting of honours, the appointment of governors general, authorizing Declarations of War, signatures of Full Powers for the signing of treaties in the Heads of State form, signatures of ratifications of such treaties, and the approval of Canadian Ambassadors to and from foreign countries.<ref name= Gotlieb>{{cite book |title= Letter to A.S. Miller, Privy Council Office from A.E. Gotlieb, Department of Foreign Affairs, 29 November 1965| publisher=Privy Council Office Archives | author=A.E. Gotlieb|year=1965 |location=Ottawa}}</ref> 

The Letters Patent of 1947 have been widely misconstrued, both intentionally and unintentionally, as effecting a ''transfer'' of all the powers of the Crown to the governor general, and thus putting the governor general in a position equal to that of the Queen. For example, under the tenure of [[Micha<U+00EB>lle Jean]], nearly all references to the Queen were removed from the governor general's website, citing the 1947 Letters Patent as "transferring all the duties of Head of State of Canada to the Governor General".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090205195406/http://gg.ca/gg/rr/index_e.asp | title=2009 Archive Image: Role and Responsibilities of the Governor General | publisher=Office of the Governor General | date=December 15, 2008| accessdate=April 04, 2012}}</ref> This opinion seems to have surfaced under former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, who in her memoirs expressed that even "many politicians don't seem to know that the final authority of the state was transferred from the monarch to the Governor General in the Letters Patent of 1947".<ref>{{cite book | title=Heart Matters | publisher=Viking Canada | author=Clarkson, Adrienne | year=2006 | location=Toronto |pages=190}}</ref> This line of thinking came to a head in 2009 when Clarkson stated that she was in fact Canada's "Head of State", which eventually led to a public rebuke from [[Stephen Harper|Prime Minister Stephen Harper]] among others, who stated "categorically that Queen Elizabeth II is Canada's Head of State" and that the Governor General serves as the Queen's representative in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/keep-the-queen-and-choose-another-head-of-state/article4314344/?service=mobile | title=Keep the Queen and choose another head of state | publisher=Globe and Mail | date=August 23, 2012 | accessdate=September 03, 2012 |author=Franks, C.E.S.}}</ref> It is apparent that it was never the belief of the government that such powers had ever been transferred.<ref name= Smith /><ref name= Gotlieb /><ref name= Schuster /> In addition, the tabling of Bill C-60 in 1978, which moved to transfer powers exercised by the Queen to the governor general would have been completely redundant if such a transfer had already occurred 31 years previous.<ref name=Smith>{{cite journal | url=http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/may99/smith.pdf | title=Republican Tendancies |author=Smith, David E. |journal=Policy Options | year=1999 | month=May | pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-republic.ca/history.html | title=History | publisher=Citizens for a Canadian Republic | date=April 23, 2011|accessdate=September 03, 2012}}</ref> 

==Impact==
While the role that the governor general fills is largely ceremonial, the powers of the Crown that the Constitution as well as the 1947 Letters Patent delegates to the office are substantial. Increased attention is sometimes brought to these powers by political events, such as the recent 2009 prorogation, which served to increasingly highlight the role of the Governor General plays within the Canadian Constitution.<ref>{{cite conference | title=The Constitutional Role of the Governor General | publisher=Institute of Intergovernmental Relations, School of Policy Studies, Queen's University | author=Patrick Monahan | editor=Smith, Jennifer; Jackson, Michael D | year=2010|month=June | conference=State of the Federation Conference | location=West Block, Parliament of Canada, Ottawa}}</ref> Even with the monarch's delegation of powers, the Letters Patent serves to put the governor general in a position which is still "not in quite the same position as the Sovereign in regard to the exercise of certain prerogative powers",<ref>{{cite book | title=The Government of Canada |publisher=University of Toronto Press | author=Dawson, R.M. | year=1948 | location=Toronto}}</ref> but at the same time allows a large amount of flexibility in the exercise of the Crown's powers.
