'''Frederick Russell Burnham''', [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (May 11, 1861&nbsp;<U+2013> September 1, 1947) was an American [[reconnaissance|scout]] and world traveling adventurer known for his service to the [[British Army]] in [[colonial Africa]] and for teaching ''[[Scoutcraft|woodcraft]]''<!-- Do not change link to "Woodcraft". --> to [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], thus becoming one of the inspirations for the founding of the international [[Scouting|Scouting Movement]].

Burnham had little formal education, attending high school but never graduating. He began his career at 14 in the [[American Southwest]] as a scout and tracker for the [[U.S. Army]] in the [[Apache Wars]] and [[Cheyenne Wars]]. Sensing the [[Old West]] was getting too tame, as an adult Burnham went to Africa where this background proved useful. He soon became an officer in the British Army, serving in several battles there. During this time, Burnham became friends with Baden-Powell, and passed on to him both his outdoor skills and his spirit for what would later become known as Scouting.

Burnham eventually moved on to become involved in [[espionage]], oil, conservation, writing and business. His descendants are still active in Scouting.

==Early life==
[[File:Burnham skagway alaska 1899.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Frederick Burnham in [[Arizona Territory]] during 1881.]]
Burnham was born to a [[missionary]] family on an Indian Reservation in Tivoli, [[Minnesota]]. As a toddler, he witnessed the burning of [[New Ulm, Minnesota]], by [[Taoyateduta]] (Little Crow) and his [[Sioux]] warriors in the [[Dakota War of 1862]]. During the uprising, his mother, Rebecca (Elizabeth) Russell Burnham, hid the not-quite-two-year-old boy in a basket of green corn husks and fled for her life. Once the Sioux had been driven away the mother returned to find the house burned down. Her young son was safe, fast asleep in the basket and protected only by the corn husks.<ref name="davis"/><ref name="scouting">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |title=Scouting on Two Continents |publisher=Doubleday, Page & company |year=1926 |pages=2; Chapters 3 & 4 |id={{OCLC |407686}} |isbn=0869201263}}</ref>

The young Burnham attended schools in Iowa and there he met Blanche Blick, who would later become his wife. His family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1870. Two years later his father, the Rev. [[Edwin Otway Burnham]] of Kentucky, himself a long time pioneer and missionary along the border of the Ho Chunk (Winnebago) Indian reservation in Minnesota, died when Burnham was only 12. While his mother and his then 3 year old baby brother [[Howard Burnham]] returned to Iowa, the young Burnham stayed in California to make his own way.<ref name="pressreflib"/>

For the next three years, Burnham worked as a mounted messenger for the [[Western Union Telegraph Company]] in California and [[Arizona]]. On one occasion his horse was stolen from him by [[Tiburcio Vasquez]], a famous [[Californio]] [[outlaw|bandit]].<ref name="latimes6sep1931">{{cite journal |last=Carr |first=Harry |year=1931 |month=September 6 |title=They knew the old California bandits |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |pages=K10}}</ref> At 14, he began his life as a scout and Indian tracker in the [[Apache Wars]]. He traveled in northern Mexico and the American Southwest, including [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]], earning a living as a buffalo hunter, cowboy, and prospector, and he continued working as a scout while tracking Indians in the [[Cheyenne War]]. The young Burnham eventually went on to attend high school in California but never graduated.<ref name="pressreflib">{{cite book |title=Press Reference Library: Notables of the West |publisher=International News Service |year=1915}}</ref>

In 1882, Burnham returned to Arizona and was appointed Deputy Sheriff of [[Pinal County]], but he soon went back to cattle and mining interests. He joined the losing side of the [[Pleasant Valley War|Tonto Basin Feud]] before mass killing started, and only narrowly escaped death in Arizona.<ref name="scouting"/><ref name="blackwoodtontobasin">{{cite journal |last=Money |first=R. R. |title=Tonto Basin Feud |journal=[[Blackwood's Magazine]] |year=1962 |month=April |volume=291 |issn=0006-436X}}</ref> He returned to [[Prescott, Iowa]], to visit his childhood sweetheart, Blanche, and the two were married on February 6, 1884.<ref name="pressreflib">{{cite book |title=Press Reference Library: Notables of the West |publisher=International News Service |year=1915 |page=241}}</ref> That same year, he and Blanche settled down to tend to an orange grove in [[Pasadena, California]], but within a year he was back prospecting and scouting.

In the 1880s the American press had been popularizing the notion that the West had been won and there was nothing left to conquer in the United States. This idea changed Burnham's life. Ever the soldier of fortune, he began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier. When he heard of the work of [[Cecil Rhodes]] and his pioneers in building the [[Cape to Cairo railway]] in Africa, Burnham sold what little he owned and, in 1893, set sail to [[Cape Town, South Africa]], with his wife and young son. He soon joined the [[British South Africa Company]] as a scout and headed north. Burnham became well known in Africa for his ability to track, even at night, and the Africans dubbed him ''He-who-sees-in-the-dark.''<ref name="jameswest">{{cite book |last=West |first=James E. |authorlink=James E.

Burnham is the brother of [[Howard Burnham|Mather Howard Burnham]], a mining engineer and spy, and second cousin of Lt. [[Howard Mather Burnham]], killed in the [[American Civil War]].

==Military career==
[[Image:Burnham in africa close up.jpg|left|thumb|Burnham in Africa (middle) holding his Remington Model 1875 No. 3 Army in .44WCF rifle]]

===First Matabele War===
{{details|First Matabele War}}

Burnham<U+2019>s first major test in Africa came in 1893 when the British South Africa Company went to war with the [[Northern Ndebele people|Matabele]] King [[Lobengula]]. [[Leander Starr Jameson]] had hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal city of [[Bulawayo]]. Burnham and a small group of scouts were sent ahead to report on the situation in Bulawayo. While on the outskirts of town they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the white troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo.<ref name="wilsonmatabeleland">{{cite book |last=Donovan |first=Charles Henry Wynne |title=With Wilson in Matabeleland, Or, Sport and War in Zambesia |publisher=Henry |year=1894 |location=London |page=271 |isbn=0869201808}}</ref>

====Shangani Patrol====
{{details|Shangani Patrol}}

After he found that Bulawayo had been abandoned, Jameson dispatched a column of soldiers to locate and capture Lobengula. The column, led by Maj. [[Patrick William Forbes|Patrick Forbes]], camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north-east of the village of Lupane on the evening of December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Maj. [[Allan Wilson (Major)|Allan Wilson]] were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula<U+2019>s whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson patrol, sensed a trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.<ref name="efknight">{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=Archibald |coauthors=Arthur Griffiths, George Alfred Henty, and E. F. Knight |title=Battles of the Nineteenth Century |publisher=Castle |year=1896 |location=London, Paris, Melbourne |pages=110<U+2013>119}}</ref>

Soon afterwards, the patrol found the king and Wilson sent a message back to the [[laager]] requesting reinforcements. Forbes, however, was unwilling to set off across the river in the dark, so he sent only 20 more men, under the command of Henry Borrow, to reinforce Wilson<U+2019>s patrol. Forbes intended to send the main body of troops and artillery across the river the following morning; however, the main column was ambushed by Matabele warriors and delayed. Wilson<U+2019>s patrol too came under attack, but the Shangani River had swollen and there was now no possibility of retreat. In desperation, Wilson sent Burnham and two other scouts, Pearl <U+201C>Pete<U+201D> Ingram (a [[Montana]] cowboy) and George Gooding (an Australian), to cross the Shangani River, find Forbes, and bring reinforcements. In spite of a shower of bullets and spears, the three made it to Forbes, but the battle raging there was just as intense as the one they had left, and there was no hope of anyone reaching Wilson in time. As Burnham loaded his rifle to beat back the Matabele warriors, he quietly said to Forbes, "I think I may say that we are the sole survivors of that party." Wilson, Borrow, and their men were indeed surrounded by hundreds of Matabele warriors; escape was impossible, and all were killed.<ref name="efknight">{{cite book |last=Forbes |first=Archibald |coauthors=Arthur Griffiths, George Alfred Henty, and E.

===Northern Rhodesia Exploration===
In 1895, Burnham went on to oversee and lead the massive Northern Territories (BSA) Exploration Co. expedition which first established for the British South Africa Company that major copper deposits existed in [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]].<ref name="burnham1899">{{cite book |last=Burnham |first=Frederick Russell |editor-first=Walter H. |editor-last=Wills |title=[[s:Northern Rhodesia|Bulawayo Up-to-date; Being a General Sketch of Rhodesia]] |publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent & Co. |year=1899 |pages=177<U+2013>180 |chapter=Northern Rhodesia}}</ref><ref name="baxter1970">{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=T.W. |coauthors=E.E.

===Second Matabele War===
[[Image:After mlimo.jpg|thumb|right|Burnham & Armstrong after the assassination of Mlimo. Matabele warriors in hot pursuit.]]
{{details|Second Matabele War}}

In March 1896, the Matabele again revolted against the authority of the British South Africa Company in what is now celebrated in [[Zimbabwe]] as the First War of Independence. Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger that led to this confrontation. Matabeleland defenses were in disarray due to the ill-fated [[Jameson Raid]], and in the first few months of the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]], and [[Frederick Selous|Selous]]. An estimated 50,000 Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills]] near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting against the white settler patrols.<ref name="fcselous">{{cite book |last=Selous |first=Frederick Courteney |authorlink=Frederick Selous |title=Sunshine and Storm in Rhodesia |publisher=R.

====Assassination of Mlimo====
The turning point in the war came when Burnham and a young scout named Bonar Armstrong found their way through Matobo Hills to the sacred cave where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two scouts tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered.<ref name="nyt25jun1896">{{cite journal |date=June 25, 1896 |title=Killed the Matabele God: Burnham, the American scout, may end uprising |journal=[[New York Times]] |issn=0093-1179 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E7DF123BEE33A25756C2A9609C94679ED7CF |accessdate=2007-09-28 |format=PDF}}</ref> Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart.<ref name="nyt25jun1896"/>

The two scouts then leapt over the dead Mlimo and ran down a trail toward their horses. Hundreds of warriors, encamped nearby, picked up their arms and searched for the attackers. To distract the Matabele, Burnham set fire to the village. The two men got on their horses and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after learning of the assassination of Mlimo, Cecil Rhodes boldly walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in Matobo Hills and persuaded the [[impi]] to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.<ref name="farwell">{{cite book |last=Farwell |first=Byron |authorlink=Byron Farwell |title=The Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-Century Land Warfare: An Illustrated World View |publisher=W.

===Klondike Gold Rush===
With the Matabele war over, Burnham decided it was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family returned to California where Burnham left his wife and young son Bruce with his mother. Soon after, he and his eldest son Roderick, then 12 years old, traveled to Alaska and the [[Yukon]] to prospect in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].<ref name="scouting"/> Upon hearing of the [[Spanish-American War]], Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but before he could get to the fighting the war was already over. Burnham then returned to the Klondike. Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.<ref name="pressreflib"/>

===Second Boer War===

{{details|Second Boer War}}

In January 1900, while prospecting in [[Skagway, Alaska]], Burnham received the following telegram: ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] appoints you on his personal staff as Chief of Scouts. If you accept, come at once the quickest way possible.'' Although Cape Town is at the opposite end of the globe from the Klondike, he left within the hour.<ref name="americanheritage">{{cite journal |author=Byron Farwell |authorlink=Byron Farwell |year=1976 |month=March |title=Taking Sides in the Boer War |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=20 |issue=3 |issn=0002-8738 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1976/3/1976_3_20.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-07}}</ref> He would arrive at the front just before the [[Battle of Paardeberg]]. During the war, Burnham spent much time behind the Boer lines gathering information and blowing up railway bridges and tracks. He was twice captured and twice escaped, but he was also disabled for a time by his near-fatal wounds.

In a step that was unusual for a foreigner, Burnham was given a commission by Lord Roberts and the rank of captain.<ref name="americanheritage"/> Burnham was first captured while trying to warn a British column approaching [[Thaba Nchu|Thaba' Nchu]].<ref name="atlantaconstitution8apr1900">{{cite journal |date=April 8, 1900 |title=American scout escapes |journal=[[Atlanta Constitution]] issn=0093-1179}}</ref><ref name="ungerbobs">{{cite book |author=Frederic William Unger |title=With "Bobs" and Kr<U+00FC>ger: Experiences and Observations of an American War Correspondent in the Field with both Armies |publisher=H.T.

Cut off from his own side, Burnham chose to signal the approaching soldiers even though it would expose him to capture. With a red kerchief, Burnham signaled the soldiers to turn back, but the column paid no attention and plodded steadily on into the ambush, while Burnham was at once taken prisoner. In the fight that followed, Burnham pretended to receive a wound in the knee. Limping heavily and groaning with pain, he was placed in a wagon with the officers who really were wounded, and who, in consequence, were not closely guarded. Later that evening, Burnham slipped over the driver's seat, dropped between the two wheels of the wagon, lowered himself and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the road. In an instant the wagon had passed over him safely, and while the dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the ditch at the side of the road and lay motionless. It was four days before he was able to re-enter the British lines, during which time he had been lying in the open veldt. He had subsisted on one biscuit and two handfuls of "mealies" (i.e., [[maize]]).<ref name="scouting"/><ref name="nyt1901">{{cite journal |date=May 5, 1901 |title=England's American Scout |journal=[[New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A01E0DD1139E733A25756C0A9639C946097D6CF |accessdate=2007-09-28 |format=PDF}}</ref>

On June 2, 1900, while trying by night to blow up the bridge on the [[Pretoria]]-[[Delagoa Bay]] railway line at [[Bronkhorstspruit]], {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} east of [[Pretoria]] and a vital link to the sea, Burnham was surrounded by a party of Boers and could save himself only by instant flight. He had all but gotten away when a bullet caught his horse; it crashed to the ground dead, crushing Burnham beneath it and knocking him senseless. He continued in a dazed state for nearly a day and when he came to his senses he found that both friends and foes had departed. Although still suffering the most acute agony, Burnham heroically crept back to the railroad, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. Knowing the explosion would soon bring the Boers, he crept on his hands and knees to an empty [[kraal]] and lay there for two days and nights insensible. Upon hearing the sound of distant firing, Burnham crawled toward the fighting. By then he was indifferent as to whether the gunshots were coming from the enemy or from his own people, but, as it chanced, he was picked up by a friendly patrol and carried to Pretoria. The surgeons discovered that in his fall Burnham had torn apart the muscles of the stomach and burst a blood-vessel. His survival, the doctors assured him, was due only to the fact that he had been without food for three days.

Burnham was already a celebrated scout when he first befriended Baden-Powell during the Second Matabele War. Himself a brilliant outdoorsman, Baden-Powell was a distinguished cavalry officer, and reportedly the finest [[Boar hunting|pig sticker]] in India.

===Yaqui===

Burnham returned to North America and for the next few years became associated with the [[Yaqui River]] irrigation project in Mexico. While investigating the Yaqui valley for mineral and agricultural resources, Burnham reasoned that a dam could provide year-round water to rich [[alluvial soil]] in the valley; turning the region into one of the garden spots of the world and generate much needed electricity. He purchased water rights and some {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of land in this region and contacted an old friend from Africa, [[John Hays Hammond]], who conducted his own studies and then purchased an additional {{convert|900000|acre|km2}} of this land<U+2014>an area the size of [[Rhode Island]].

===Oil wealth===
Although Burnham had lived all over the world, he never had a great deal of wealth to show for his efforts. It was not until he returned to California, the place of his youth, that he struck it rich. In 1923, Burnham struck oil at Dominguez Hill, California.

===Conservation===
An avid [[conservationist]] and [[hunter]], Burnham supported the early conservation programs of his friends Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa with the goal of finding large animals such as [[Giant Eland]], [[hippopotamus]], [[zebra]], and various bird species that might be bred in the United States and become game for future American sportsmen.

==Personal life==
===Appearance===
At 5&nbsp;ft 4&nbsp;in (1.62&nbsp;m), Burnham was slight, but he was also muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish appearance which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.<ref name="davis"/><ref name="scouting"/><ref name="days">{{cite book |last=Haggard |first=H.

===Mannerisms===
Burnham would not smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of his sense of smell. He found ways to train himself in mental patience, took [[power naps]] instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when scouting or traveling where there was no water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. To him scouting was as exact a study as is the piano, and it was said that he could read the face of nature as easily as most could read their morning newspaper. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.<ref name="davis"/><ref name="scouting"/><ref name="days"/>

===Family===
[[Image:Blanche blick burnham in africa 1896.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Blanche Blick Burnham in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, 1896]]

Burnham's wife of 55 years, Blanche Blick Burnham (February 25, 1862 - December 22, 1939) of [[Nevada, Iowa]], accompanied him in very primitive conditions through many travels in both the Southwest United States and Southern Africa. They had three children together, but only one survived into adulthood. In the early years, she watched over the children and the pack animals, always careful to keep a rifle within arms length. In the dark of night, she used her rifle many times against [[lions]] and [[hyena]] and, during the Siege of Bulawayo, against Ndebele warriors. Several members of the Blick family joined the Burnhams in Rhodesia, moved with them to England, and returned to the United States with the Burnhams to live near [[Three Rivers, California]]. When Burnham Exploration Company struck it rich in 1923, the Burnhams moved to a mansion in a new housing development then known as [[Hollywood, California|Hollywoodland]] (a name later shortened to "Hollywood") and took many trips around the world in high style. In 1939, Blanche suffered a stroke. She died a month later and was buried in the Three Rivers Cemetery.<ref name="familyletters">{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Mary E |coauthors=Richard H Bradford |title=An American family on the African frontier: the Burnham family letters, 1893<U+2013>1896 |publisher=Roberts Rinehart |year=1993 |location=Niwot, Colorado |isbn=1-879373-66-1}}</ref><ref name="vanwyk"/>

The author of a number of books of biography and social commentary Russell won a Pulitzer Prize in 1928 for his biography: ''The American Orchestra and [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]''.

In 1943, at 83 years of age, Burnham married his young typist, Ilo K. Willetts Burnham (1914<U+2013>1958).

Also buried at Three Rivers cemetery is his first wife, Blanche Blick Burnham, several members of the Blick family who had also pioneered in 19th century Rhodesia with Burnham for a time, his son Roderick, his granddaughter Martha Burnham Burleigh, and the Montana cowboy <U+201C>Pete<U+201D> Ingram who survived the Shangani Patrol massacre along with Burnham.<ref name="Kaweah">{{cite web |last=Elliott |first=John |year=2004 |url=http://www.kaweahcommonwealth.com/8-27-04features.htm |title=King of Scouts honored at gravesite |publisher=The Kaweah Commonwealth Online |accessdate=2004-08-27}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Ernest Hemingway]] acquired the rights to produce a film version of ''Scouting on Two Continents'' in late 1958. [[CBS]] immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television, with [[Gary Cooper]] expressing an interest in playing the part of Burnham. Hemingway was already behind schedule in his other commitments and never started on the film when he committed suicide in July 1961.<ref name="hemingway">{{cite book |last=Hemingway |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Hemingway |coauthors=[[A.

In 1933, the newly discovered ''Serbelodon burnhami'' (now ''Amebelodon burnhami''), an extinct [[gomphothere]] (Shovel-Tusker elephant) from North America, was officially named after Burnham.<ref name="ammuseumnov29jun1933">{{cite journal |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |year=1933 |month=June 29 |title=Serbelodon Burnhami, a new Shovel-Tusker from California |journal=American Museum Novitates |issue=639 |pages=1<U+2013>5 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/2061/1/N0639.pdf |accessdate=2007-11-01 |format=PDF}}</ref>

''On My Honor'', an epic film conceived and begun by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], was to document the founding of the Scouting movement but was left unfinished because of the legendary producer's untimely death in January 1959. In the screenplay started by [[Jesse Lasky, Jr.]], the film would have focused on Baden-Powell and the Scouting pioneers who were a major influence on Baden-Powell, including Burnham.  Even after DeMille's death, associate producer [[Henry Wilcoxon]] continued to invest substantial work on the film until 1962, and [[Sydney Box]] was hired to assist with the script.  Starting in 2001, producers [[Gerald R. Molen|Jerry Molen]] and Robert Starling began work to finish DeMille's project, including an updated screenplay by Starling based on the earlier work of Lasky and Box.<ref name="demillehollywood">{{cite book |last=Birchard |first=Robert S. |title=Cecil B.

===Allan Quatermain and Indiana Jones===
{{quote box |width=20em |border=1px |align=right |bgcolor=#c6dbf7  |quote=''"Burnham in real life is more interesting than any of my heroes of romance!"''
|source=<U+2014> ''[[Henry Rider Haggard|Sir H. Rider Haggard]]''<ref name="scouting"/>}}
Rider Haggard's fictional [[Allan Quatermain]] character was heavily influenced by his close friendship with Burnham. Quatermain and Burnham were both small and wiry [[Victorian era|Victorian]] adventurers in colonial Africa, both sought and discovered ancient treasures and civilizations, both battled large wild animals and native peoples, both were renowned for their ability to track, even at night, and both men had strikingly similar nicknames: Quatermain, "Watcher-by-Night"; Burnham, "He-who-sees-in-the-dark".  But Burnham<U+2019>s influence on fictional adventurers wasn<U+2019>t to end there.  In the 1970s, a young movie director, [[George Lucas]], decided to write the ultimate adventure film.  The template for his hero, [[Indiana Jones]], was the hero of the H. Rider Haggard books, Allan Quatermain.<ref name="hough2010"/>
