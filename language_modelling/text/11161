The '''66th Boat Race''' took place on 3 April 1909.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Cambridge were reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1908|previous year's race]], while Oxford's heavier crew contained three Olympic gold medallists.  In a race umpired by [[Frederick I. Pitman]], Oxford won by three-and-a-half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 50 seconds.  It was their first win in four races and took the overall record to 35&ndash;30 in their favour.

Oxford's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the [[The Boat Race 1882|1882]] and [[The Boat Race 1883|1883 races]], Francis Escombe (for the sixth consecutive year), [[Harcourt Gilbey Gold]] (Dark Blue president for the [[The Boat Race 1900|1900 race]] and four-time Blue), W. F. C. Holland who had rowed for Oxford four times between 1887 and 1890, and [[Felix Warre]] (who had rowed in 1898 and 1899).  Cambridge were coached by [[Stanley Muttlebury]], five-time Blue between 1886 and 1890, and David Alexander Wauchope (who had rowed in the [[The Boat Race 1895|1895 race]]).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>   For the sixth year the umpire was old [[Eton College|Etonian]] [[Frederick I.

Former rower and author George Drinkwater noted that Oxford had "a considerable wealth of material" at their disposal, while Cambridge had "very good [[The Boat Race#Build-up|Trial Eights]]".<ref name=drink122123>Drinkwater, pp. 123&ndash;124</ref>  He went on to describe Oxford as "a very rough crew" upon arrival at Putney.<ref name=drink123>Drinkwater, p. 123</ref>  Conversely, Cambridge "rapidly got together" and despite a late replacement at [[Bow (rowing)|bow]], Cambridge were favourites to win the race.<ref name=drink123/>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 8.25&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (79.8&nbsp;kg), {{convert|3.25|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.  Cambridge's crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience, including H. E. Kitching, [[Edward Gordon Williams|Edward Williams]] and [[Douglas Stuart (rower)|Douglas Stuart]].  Oxford saw six crew members return to the boat, including [[Alister Kirby]] and [[Sir Albert Gladstone, 5th Baronet|Albert Gladstone]], both of whom were making their fourth consecutive appearances.  Six occupants of the Dark Blue boat were educated at Eton College.<ref name=burn69>Burnell, p. 69</ref> Oxford's number three, Australian [[Collier Cudmore]], was the only non-British participant registered in the race.<ref>Burnell, p. 39</ref>  Three of the Oxford crew who were studying at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], [[Duncan Mackinnon]], [[James Angus Gillan]] and Cudmore, were gold medallists in the [[Rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's coxless four|men's coxless four]] at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]].<ref>Burnell, p. 13</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1908/ROW/mens-coxless-fours.html | title = Rowing at the 1908 London Summer Games: Men's Coxless Fours| publisher = [[Sports Reference]] | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}</ref>   Cambridge's number five, [[Edward Gordon Williams]], won a bronze medal in the [[Rowing at the 1908 Summer Olympics <U+2013> Men's eight|men's eight]] in the same Olympiad.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/wi/edward-williams-1.html | title = Edward Williams | publisher = [[Sports Reference]] | accessdate = 20 January 2015}}</ref>  Six of the Oxford crew were studying at Magdalen College, while five of Cambridge's were matriculated at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]].<ref name=burn69/>

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]] along which the Boat Race is contested]]
Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford.<ref name=ross228/>  Drinkwater described the condtions as "perfect" and umpire Pitman started the race at 12:38&nbsp;p.m.  Both crews made strong starts but Oxford edged ahead and held a third of a length lead after a minute which they extended to a half-length after two minutes.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 123&ndash;124</ref>  The Cambridge stroke Stuart kept the Light Blue [[stroke rate]] high round the bend to the Mile Post and his counterpart Bourne allowed them to draw level by [[Harrods Furniture Depository]].<ref name=drink124>Drinkwater, p. 124</ref>  

As the crews passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]], Cambridge held a slender lead.  Despite a number of spurts from Oxford, the Light Blues held on to the lead, but relinquished it briefly before Stuart spurted once again as the crews passed into Corney Reach to re-take the lead.  Oxford pushed on {{convert|300|yd|m}} before [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] and left Cambridge behind "as if standing".<ref name=drink124/>  Clear at Barnes Bridge, Oxford extended their lead with every stroke and won by three and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 50 seconds.<ref name=ross228>Ross, p. 228</ref>  It was Oxford's first victory in four years and took the overall record in the event to 35&ndash;30 in their favour.<ref name=results/>
