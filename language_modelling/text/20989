'''''Anbe Vaa''''' ({{lang-en|''Come, My Love''}}) is a 1966 [[Indian cinema|Indian]] [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]] [[romantic comedy film]] written and directed by [[A. C. Tirulokchandar]]. The film features [[M. G. Ramachandran]] and [[B. Saroja Devi]] in the lead roles, while [[S. A. Ashokan]], [[Nagesh]], [[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]], [[T. R. Ramachandran]] and [[P. D. Sambandam]] play supporting roles. Broadly based on the 1961 [[American cinema|American]] film ''[[Come September]]'' directed by [[Robert Mulligan]], ''Anbe Vaa'' was produced and distributed by [[AVM Productions]]. The [[Original soundtrack|soundtrack]] and [[background music|score]] were composed by [[M. S. Viswanathan]] while the lyrics for the tracks were written by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]].

''Anbe Vaa'' was the first film produced by AVM to be shot in [[Technicolor#The_introduction_of_Eastman_color_and_decline|Eastman Color]], as well as being their first big-budget production; they had previously focused only on modest-budget films. The film was also the studio and Tirulokchandar's only collaboration with Ramachandran. The film follows JB (M. G. Ramachandran), a wealthy industrialist who goes on vacation to his bungalow in [[Shimla]], only to discover that his caretaker (P. D. Sambandam) and his wife have left for [[Varanasi]] after renting the bungalow to a family of three. The rest of the film revolves around JB's response to this situation that he finds himself in.

[[Principal photography]] for the film began in August 1965. Shooting for the film took place in Shimla, [[Ooty]] and at the hill station of [[Kufri, India|Kufri]]. This was the second ever Tamil film to be shot at [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. Filming was completed within five months, the shortest duration for a film starring Ramachandran.

''Anbe Vaa'' was released on 14 January 1966. The final length of the film was {{Convert|4855|metres|feet}}. It received positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised Ramachandran's performance, as he was known for doing mainly action-adventure films up until that point in his career. The film grossed {{INR}} 3.3 million at the box office, against a budget of {{INR}} 3 million. The film was dubbed into [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]], under the title ''Prema Manasulu''.

== Plot ==
JB ([[M.G. Ramachandran]]) is a wealthy industrialist who decides to take a vacation at his residence in [[Shimla]]. Upon his arrival, he discovers that his caretaker ([[P. D. Sambandam]]) has rented his house to a [[Bangalore]]-based couple, Punyakodi ([[T. R. Ramachandran]]) and Pappamma (M. S. S. Bhagyam), and their daughter, Geetha ([[B. Saroja Devi]]). The caretaker and his wife leave for Varanasi after taking the money for the rent, leaving the caretaker's daughter, Kannamma ([[Manorama (Tamil actress)|Manorama]]), and brother-in-law, Ramaiah ([[Nagesh]]), in charge of the house and the guests. JB decides not to reveal his true identity, pretending to be JB's personal secretary Balu, and pays the rent for a place in his own house. Ramaiah, who has never met JB, takes the money and gives Balu JB's room.

Balu plays continual pranks on Geetha, during the course of which he also falls in love with her. Geetha reciprocates his feelings, but circumstances and their egos prevent them both from expressing those feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there.  He tells Ramaiah about his prank on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she had been deceived by Balu, she begins to question whether or not his professed love for her is also deceit. Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house. When her plan backfires and her friends start supporting Balu, she becomes spiteful and tells her parents to move forward with a planned marriage to Sekar ([[S. A. Ashokan]]), a relative and an air force pilot.

Geetha reconciles with Balu after he saves her from a wrestler named Sitting Bull. But by the time Balu confesses his love for her, Geetha's engagement is already fixed. Luckily, Sekar turns out to be a school friend of JB, and when he discovers that Balu and Geetha are truly in love, he and steps aside, wishing the couple a happy life. When Balu is finally revealed as JB, Geetha, again not knowing what to believe, thinks the wedding plans are yet another of Balu's practical jokes and tries to run away. He finds her and clears up all of the misunderstandings between them. The two then get married.

''Anbe Vaa'' marked the first time where AVM wrote a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already completed script.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2012|page=147}} While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, [[A. V. Meiyappan]] made the suggestion to approach Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.<ref name = "Tirulok"/> 

When approached, Ramachandran readily accepted the role and was excited about doing it,{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} giving the film priority in his schedule.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} Ramachandran gave a [[Daily call sheet|call sheet]] of seventy two days for participating in the film.{{Sfn|Saravanan|2005|page=170}} He was paid a salary of {{INR}} 300,000-325,000 for his participation in the film;{{efn|[[G. Dhananjayan]] and Saravanan state in their books that M. G. Ramachandran was paid {{INR}} 325,000,{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}}<ref name = "Sylvian"/> whereas ''[[The Economic Times]]'' states that he was paid {{INR}} 300,000.<ref name = "AVTOI"/>}} however, it turned out to be his only collaboration with both Tirulokchandar and AVM Productions.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=234}}<ref name = "Tirulok"/>

Ramachandran initially recommended [[K. A. Thangavelu]] for the role of Punyakodi, but [[M. Saravanan (film producer)|M. Saravanan]], one of the film's producers, said that his father, A. V. Meiyappan, wanted [[T. R. Ramachandran]] in the role. M.G. Ramachandran accepted the decision and told Saravanan not to tell T. R. Ramachandran about his initial choice.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/interview-with-avm-saravanan/article6594598.ece | title=A word kept | date=13 November 2014 | accessdate=26 November 2014 | author=Malathi Rangarajan | newspaper=The Hindu | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141113165714/http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/interview-with-avm-saravanan/article6594598.ece | archivedate=13 November 2014}}</ref> M. G. Ramachandran also recommended [[Jayalalithaa]] for the role of Geetha, but when the producers disagreed with that selection, Ramachandran then suggested [[B. Saroja Devi]], who was given the role.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}}

=== Filming ===
''Anbe Vaa'' was the first film of AVM Productions to be made in [[Eastman Color]].<ref name = "Sylvian"/> [[Principal photography]] for the film began with a ''[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]''{{efn|''Puja'' is a prayer ritual performed by [[Hindu]]s to host, honour and worship one or more deities, or to spiritually celebrate an event.{{Sfn|Lochtefeld|2002|pages=529-530}}}} ceremony held on 12 August 1965. Filming was completed within five months, the quickest completion for any film starring M. G. Ramachandran.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page = 235}} Ramachandran received special permission to go by car to shoot the film in exotic locations in Shimla; a privilege allowed only to the governor of the state. Under the auspices of that permission, the entire unit went to Shimla.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} The song "Pudhiya Vaanam" was shot in the small hill station of [[Kufri, India|Kufri]], located 13 kilometres from Shimla, as well as at [[Mall Road, Shimla]].<ref name = "Making"/>

Savi, an editor who worked for the Tamil magazine, ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'', accompanied the production unit and published an article on the making of the film.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} Although the story is set in Shimla, 95% of the film was shot in [[Ooty]], with some scenes being filmed in [[Jammu and Kashmir]],{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} making it the second Tamil film after ''[[Then Nilavu]]'' (1961) to be shot there.{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=234}} "Naan Paarthathilae" was one of the few songs in the film that was shot outdoors, due to Ramachandran not wanting to attract attention from his large fan following.<ref name = "Sylvian"/> During shooting in Ooty, Ramachandran personally bought sweaters for the entire cast and crew.<ref name = "Making"/>

The production unit, composed of 20 crew members, along with Tirulokchandar, M. G. Ramachandran, Saroja Devi and Savi, initially flew to Delhi. From Delhi, they travelled to [[Kalka]] by train, then continued on to Shimla, using three first-generation [[Chevrolet Impala]]s.<ref name = "Making">{{cite web|url=http://www.adrasaka.com/2012/05/blog-post_2999.html|title=<U+0B85><U+0BA9><U+0BCD><U+0BAA><U+0BC7> <U+0BB5><U+0BBE> - <U+0B8E><U+0BAE><U+0BCD> <U+0B9C><U+0BBF> <U+0B86><U+0BB0><U+0BCD> - <U+0BB7><U+0BC2><U+0B9F><U+0BCD><U+0B9F><U+0BBF><U+0B99><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BCD> - <U+0BB5><U+0BBF><U+0B95><U+0B9F><U+0BA9><U+0BCD> <U+0BAA><U+0BCA><U+0B95><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BBF><U+0BB7> <U+0BAA><U+0B95><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0B99><U+0BCD><U+0B95><U+0BB3><U+0BCD>.

The soundtrack received positive critical reception. G.

He said the song "Pudhiya Vaanam" had "a political touch", and was "brilliantly photographed by master lens man S. Maruthi Rao."

=== Critical reception ===
On 6 August 1966, the review in ''Ananda Vikatan'' said, "The film was an English film in Tamil... The film does not have any story. One can spend three hours in an entertaining manner with this film..."{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}} Randor Guy, in his review, wrote, "The screenplay was brilliantly written by ACT. MGR<U+2019>s performance as the rich man posing as a tenant was impressive. Nagesh was inimitable. Saroja Devi looked glamorous in her glossy make-up and costume." He went on to conclude that the film would be "Remembered for the impressive performances by MGR, Nagesh and Saroja Devi, melodious music, interesting storyline and screenplay, picturesque cinematography which captured the beautiful landscape of the Himalayan region, and the fabulous sets in true AVM style."<ref name = "BFTP Guy"/> G. Dhananjayan commented, "The film stood out for its comedy, memorable songs and dances, rich making and locations.", and said that the main reason for the film's success was that it was "an out-and-out entertainer".{{sfn|Dhananjayan|2011|page=235}}
