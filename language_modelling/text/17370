'''Sacagawea''' (also '''Sakakawea''', '''Sacajawea'''; {{IPA-en|<U+02CC>s<U+00E6>k<U+0259><U+0292><U+0259><U+02C8>wi<U+02D0><U+0259>}}[[#Name|see below]]; c. 1788 <U+2013> December 20, 1812; [[#An 1884 death?|see below]] for other theories about her death) was a [[Lemhi Shoshone|Lemhi]] [[Shoshone]] woman, who accompanied the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], acting as an interpreter and guide, in their exploration of the [[Western United States]].  She traveled thousands of miles from [[North Dakota]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] between 1804 and 1806.  Clark nicknamed her '''Janey'''.<ref>"Captain Clark created the nickname "Janey" for Sacagawea, which he transcribed twice, November 24, 1805, in his journal, and in a letter to Toussaint, August 20, 1806. It is thought that Clark's use of "Janey" derived from "jane," colloquial army slang for girl." Anderson, Irving W. "[http://www.washingtonhistory.org/wshm/lewisandclark/sacagawea.htm The Sacagawea Mystique]"</ref>  

Reliable historical information about Sacagawea is very limited.  She has become an important part of the Lewis and Clark mythology in the American public imagination.  The [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] of the early twentieth century adopted her as a symbol of women's worth and independence, erecting several statues and plaques in her memory, and doing much to spread the story of her accomplishments.<ref>Fresonke, Kris and Spence, Mark David. ''Lewis & Clark: Legacies, Memories, and New Perspectives''. University of California Press, February 25, 2004. ISBN 978-0520238220</ref>

In 2000, the [[United States Mint]] issued the [[Sacagawea dollar]] coin in her honor, depicting Sacagawea and her son, [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]]. The face on the coin was modeled on a modern [[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock]] woman named [[Randy'L He-dow Teton]].  No contemporary image of Sacagawea exists.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sacagawea was born into an ''Agaidika'' (Salmon Eater) tribe of Lemhi [[Shoshone]] between Kenney Creek and Agency Creek about twenty minutes away from present-day [[Salmon, Idaho|Salmon]] in [[Lemhi County, Idaho|Lemhi County]], [[Idaho]].<ref name=Home>[http://www.salmonidaho.com], Lemhi County Historical Museum.</ref>   In 1800, when she was about twelve, she and several other girls were kidnapped by a group of ''[[Hidatsa]]'' (also known as Minnetarees) in a battle that resulted in death among the Shoshone of four men, four women and several boys.<ref name=George>George, Rozina. [http://www.l3-lewisandclark.com/ShowOneObject.asp?SiteID=77&ObjectID=938 "Agaidika Perspective on Sacajawea]", ''Life Long Learning: The Lewis and Clark Rediscovery Project''.</ref> She was taken as a captive to a Hidatsa village near present-day [[Washburn, North Dakota]].

At about thirteen years of age, Sacagawea was taken as a wife by [[Toussaint Charbonneau]], a [[Quebecer]] [[animal trapping|trapper]] living in the village.  He had also taken another young Shoshone named Otter Woman as a wife.  Charbonneau was reported to have purchased both wives from the Hidatsa, or won Sacagawea while gambling (the gambling is the more reliable of reports).{{Citation needed|reason=Nov 2009|date=November 2009}}

===The Lewis and Clark expedition===
[[Image:Lewis-Clark-Sacagawea-baby J-B Charbonneau.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Sculpture of [[Sacajawea]] and her baby [[Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau]] with Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].]]
Sacagawea was pregnant with her first child when the [[Corps of Discovery]] arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804-1805. Captains [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] built [[Fort Mandan]].  They interviewed several trappers who might be able to interpret or guide the expedition up the [[Missouri River]] in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter when they discovered his wife spoke [[Shoshone language|Shoshone]], as they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at the [[headwaters]] of the Missouri. 

Lewis recorded in his journal on November 4, 1804: 
{{quote|"a French man by Name Chabonah, who speaks the [[Gros Ventres|Big Belly]] language visit us, he wished to hire and informed us his 2 squars were [[Shoshone|Snake]] Indians, we engage him to go on with us and take one his wives to interpret the Snake language<U+2026>" {{sic}}}}

Charbonneau and Sacagawea moved into the expedition's fort a week later.  Lewis recorded the birth of [[Jean Baptiste Charbonneau]] on February 11, 1805, noting that another of the party's interpreters administered crushed [[rattlesnake]] rattles to speed the delivery.  Clark and other European Americans nicknamed the boy "Little Pomp" or "Pompy".

In April, the expedition left Fort Mandan and headed up the Missouri River in ''[[pirogue]]s''.  They had to be poled against the current and sometimes pulled from the riverbanks.  On May 14, 1805, Sacagawea rescued items that had fallen out of a capsized boat, including the journals and records of Lewis and Clark. The corps commanders, who praised her quick action, named the [[Sacagawea River]] in her honor on May 20.

By August 1805, the corps had located a Shoshone tribe and was attempting to trade for horses to cross the [[Rocky Mountains]].  They used Sacagawea to interpret and discovered that the tribe's chief was her brother ''[[Cameahwait]]''.

Lewis recorded their reunion in his journal:
{{quote|"Shortly after Capt. Clark arrived with the Interpreter Charbono, and the Indian woman, who proved to be a sister of the Chief Cameahwait.  The meeting of those people was really affecting, particularly between Sah cah-gar-we-ah and an Indian woman, who had been taken prisoner at the same time with her, and who had afterwards escaped from the Minnetares and rejoined her nation."<ref name="libtextcenter.unl.edu">[http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/examples/servlet/transform/tamino/Library/lewisandclarkjournals?&_xmlsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/files/xml/1805-08-17.xml&_xslsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/LCstyles.xsl ''The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition'' Online: August 17, 1805]</ref> {{sic}}}}

And Clark in his:
{{quote|"The Interpreter & Square who were before me at Some distance danced for the joyful Sight, and She made signs to me that they were her nation."<ref name="libtextcenter.unl.edu"/> {{sic}}}}

The Shoshone agreed to barter horses to the group, and to provide guides to lead them over the  cold and barren Rocky Mountains.  The trip was so hard that they were reduced to eating [[tallow]] candles to survive.  When they descended into the more temperate regions on the other side, Sacagawea helped to find and cook [[camassia|camas roots]] to help them regain their strength.
[[Image:Lewis and clark-expedition.jpg|right|thumb|''Lewis and Clark on the Lower Columbia'' by [[Charles Marion Russell]]]]
As the expedition approached the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] on the [[Pacific Coast]], Sacagawea gave up her beaded belt to enable the captains to trade for a fur robe they wished to give to President [[Thomas Jefferson]].  

Clark's journal entry for November 20, 1805 reads:
{{quote|"one of the Indians had on a roab made of 2 Sea Otter Skins the fur of them were more butifull than any fur I had ever Seen    both Capt. Lewis & my Self endeavored to purchase the roab with different articles   at length we precured it for a belt of blue beeds which the Squar<U+2014>wife of our interpreter Shabono wore around her waste...."<ref>[http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/examples/servlet/transform/tamino/Library/lewisandclarkjournals?&_xmlsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/files/xml/1805-11-20.xml&_xslsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/LCstyles.xsl ''The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition'' Online: November 20, 1805]</ref> {{sic}}}}

When the corps reached the Pacific Ocean, all members of the expedition<U+2014>including Sacagawea and Clark's black manservant [[York (Lewis and Clark)|York]]<U+2014> voted on November 24 vote on the location for building their winter fort.  In January, when a [[whale]]'s carcass washed up onto the beach south of [[Fort Clatsop]], Sacagawea insisted on her right to go see this "monstrous fish".

On the return trip, they approached the Rocky Mountains in July 1806.  On July 6, Clark recorded "The Indian woman informed me that she had been in this plain frequently and knew it well.... She said we would discover a gap in the mountains in our direction..." which is now [[Gibbons Pass]]. A week later, on July 13, Sacagawea advised Clark to cross into the [[Yellowstone River]] basin at what is now known as [[Bozeman Pass]].  This was later chosen as the optimal route for the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to cross the [[continental divide]].

While Sacagawea has been depicted as a guide for the expedition, she is recorded as providing direction in only a few instances.  Her work as an interpreter certainly helped the party to negotiate with the Shoshone.  However, her greatest value to the mission may have been simply her presence during the arduous journey, which showed their peaceful intent.  While traveling through what is now [[Franklin County, Washington]], Clark noted, "The Indian woman confirmed those people of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in this quarter," and, "the wife of Shabono our interpetr we find reconsiles all the Indians, as to our freindly intentions  a woman with a party of men is a token of peace."<ref>[http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/examples/servlet/transform/tamino/Library/lewisandclarkjournals?&_xmlsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/files/xml/1805-10-13.xml&_xslsrc=http://libtextcenter.unl.edu/lewisandclark/LCstyles.xsl 'The Journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition'' Online: October 13, 1805]</ref>

As he traveled downriver from Fort Mandan at the end of the journey, Clark wrote to Charbonneau:
{{quote|"You have been a long time with me and conducted your Self in Such a manner as to gain my friendship, your woman who accompanied you that long dangerous and fatigueing rout to the Pacific Ocian and back diserved a greater reward for her attention and services on that rout than we had in our power to give her at the Mandans. As to your little Son (my boy Pomp) you well know my fondness of him and my anxiety to take him and raise him as my own child...If you are desposed to accept either of my offers to you and will bring down you Son your famn [femme, woman] Janey had best come along with you to take care of the boy untill I get him....Wishing you and your family great success & with anxious expectations of seeing my little danceing boy Baptiest I shall remain your Friend, William Clark"<ref>{{cite web

===Later life and death===

[[Image:MVI 2770 Sacajawea statue in Fort Worth, TX.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Sacajawea statue outside the [[National Cowgirl Hall of Fame]], to which she was [[posthumously]] inducted in 1977, in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]]]

After the expedition, Charbonneau and Sacagawea spent three years among the Hidatsa before accepting William Clark's invitation to settle in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] in 1809. They entrusted Jean-Baptiste's education to Clark, who enrolled the young man in the [[Saint Louis University High School|Saint Louis Academy]] boarding school.

Sacagawea gave birth to a daughter, Lizette, sometime after 1810. According to Bonnie "Spirit Wind-Walker" Butterfield, historical documents suggest Sacagawea died in 1812 of an unknown sickness: 
:"An 1811 journal entry made by [[Henry Brackenridge]], a fur dealer at [[Fort Manuel Lisa Trading Post]] on the Missouri River, stated that both Sacagawea and Charbonneau were living at the fort. He recorded that Sacagawea "<U+2026>had become sickly and longed to revisit her native country." The following year, John Luttig, a clerk at Fort Manuel Lisa recorded in his journal on December 20, 1812, that "<U+2026>the wife of Charbonneau, a Snake Squaw [the common term used to denote Shoshone Indians], died of putrid fever." He went on to say that she was "aged about 25 years. She left a fine infant girl".<ref name=Drumm>Drumm, Stella M., ed. (1920). ''Journal of a Fur-trading Expedition on the Upper Missouri: John Luttig, 1812-1813'', St. Louis: ''Missouri Historical Society''.</ref>  Documents held by Clark show that her son Baptiste had already been entrusted by Charbonneau into Clark's care for a boarding school education, at Clark's insistence (Jackson, 1962)."<ref name=Butterfield>Butterfield, Bonnie "Spirit Wind-Walker". "[http://www.bonniebutterfield.com/NativeAmericans.html Sacagawea: Captive, Indian Interpreter, Great American Legend: Her Life and Death]".</ref>

A few months later, fifteen men were killed in an Indian attack on [[Fort Lisa (North Dakota)|Fort Lisa]], then located at the mouth of the [[Bighorn River]].<ref name=Drumm />  John Luttig and Sacagawea's young daughter were among the survivors.  Toussaint Charbonneau was mistakenly thought to have been killed at this time, but he apparently lived to at least eighty.  He had signed over formal custody of his son to Clark in 1813.

As further proof that Sacagawea died in 1812, Butterfield writes:
:"An adoption document made in the Orphans Court Records in St. Louis, Missouri states, 'On August 11, 1813, William Clark became the guardian of 'Tousant Charbonneau, a boy about ten years, and Lizette Charbonneau, a girl about one year old.' For a Missouri State Court at the time, to designate a child as orphaned and to allow an adoption, both parents had to be confirmed dead in court papers."

:"The last recorded document citing Sacagawea's existence appears in William Clark's original notes written between 1825-1826. He lists the names of each of the expedition members and their last known whereabouts. For Sacagawea he writes: "Se car ja we au- Dead." (Jackson, 1962)."<ref name=Butterfield />

It is not believed that Lizette survived childhood, as there is no later record of her among Clark's papers.

===An 1884 death?===
Some American Indian oral traditions relate that rather than dying in 1812, Sacagawea left her husband Charbonneau, crossed the [[Great Plains]] and married into a [[Comanche]] tribe.  She was said to have returned to the Shoshone in Wyoming, where she died in 1884.

The question of Sacagawea's final resting place caught the attention of national suffragists seeking voting rights for women, according to author Raymond Wilson.<ref name="eastman">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nUrhXE8jZnYC|title=Ohiyesa: Charles Eastman, Santee Sioux,}} by Raymond Wilson. University of Illinois Press, 1999. ISBN 0252068513</ref>  Wilson argues that Sacagawea became a role model whom suffragettes pointed to "with pride." Wilson goes on to note:

:"Interest in Sacajawea peaked and controversy intensified when [[Grace Raymond Hebard|Dr. Grace Raymond Hebard]], professor of political economy at the University of Wyoming in Laramie and an active supporter of the Nineteenth Amendment, campaigned for federal legislation to erect an edifice honoring Sacajawea's death in 1884."<ref name="eastman" />

[[Image:SacagaweaGravePhilKonstantin.jpg|right|thumb|Marker of grave alleged to be Sacajawea's, Fort Washakie, Wyoming]]
In 1925, Dr. [[Charles Eastman]], a Dakota Sioux physician, was hired by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] to locate Sacagawea's remains.  Eastman visited many different Native American tribes to interview elderly individuals who might have known or heard of Sacagawea, and learned of a Shoshone woman at the Wind River Reservation with the Comanche name ''Porivo'' (chief woman).  Some of the people he interviewed said that she spoke of a long journey where she had helped white men, and that she had a silver Jefferson [[Indian Peace Medal|peace medal]] of the type carried by the Lewis and Clark Expedition.  He found a Comanche woman called ''Tacutine'' who said that ''Porivo'' was her grandmother.  She had married into a Comanche tribe and had a number of children, including Tacutine's father ''Ticannaf''.  Porivo left the tribe after her husband Jerk-Meat was killed.<ref name="Clark">Clark, Ella E. and Edmonds, Margot. ''Sacagawea of the Lewis and Clark Expedition''. University of California Press, September 15, 1983. ISBN 978-0520050600</ref>

According to these narratives, Porivo lived for some time at [[Fort Bridger]] in Wyoming with her sons ''Bazil'' and ''Baptiste'', who each knew several languages, including English and French.  Eventually she found her way back to the Lemhi Shoshone at the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]], where she was recorded as "Bazil's mother".<ref name="Clark" />  This woman died on April 9, 1884, and a Reverend John Roberts officiated at her funeral.

It was Eastman's conclusion that Porivo was Sacagawea.<ref>[http://ahc.uwyo.edu/eduoutreach/historyday/resources/letterwriting.html University of Wyoming American Heritage Center]</ref>  In 1963 a monument to "Sacajawea of the Shoshonis" was erected at [[Fort Washakie]] on the Wind River reservation near [[Lander, Wyoming]] on the basis of this claim.<ref>[http://www.lewisandclarktrail.com/sacajawea.htm Lewis and Clark Trail]</ref>  

The belief that Sacagawea lived to old age and died in Wyoming was widely disseminated in the United States in the 1933 biography ''Sacajawea'' by [[University of Wyoming]] professor and historian [[Grace Raymond Hebard]].  Hebard's 30 years of research which led to the biography of the Shoshone woman is called into question by critics.<ref name="legend">Sandy Mickelson, "Sacajawea legend may not be correct," ''The Messenger''; Fort Dodge, Iowa. The reporter recounts the findings from Thomas H. Johnson, "Also Called Sacajawea: Chief Woman<U+2019>s Stolen Identity." Johnson argues that Hebard had the wrong woman when she relied upon oral history that an old woman who died and is buried on the Wyoming Wind River Reservation was Sacajawea, the Shoshone woman who participated in the Lewis and Clark Expedition.</ref>  Hebard presents a stout-hearted woman in her portrayal of Sacajawea that is "undeniably long on romance and short on hard evidence, suffering from a sentimentalization of Indian culture".<ref name="virginia">Virginia Scharff, "Grace Raymond Hebard: The Independent and Feminine Life; 1861-1936," in ''Lone Voyagers: Academic Women in Coeducational Universities. 1870 - 1937'', Ed. Geraldine Joncich Clifford. New York: The Feminist Press at the City University of New York, 1989.</ref> 

In her novel ''[[Sacajawea (novel)|Sacajawea]]'' (1984), [[Anna Lee Waldo]] explored the story of Sacajawea's returning to Wyoming 50 years after her departure.  The author was well aware of the historical research supporting an 1812 death, but she chose to explore the oral tradition.

==Name==
A long-running controversy has surrounded the correct spelling, pronunciation, and etymology of the woman's name.

===Sacagawea===
''Sacagawea'' ({{IPA-en|s<U+0259><U+02CC>k<U+0251><U+02D0><U+0261><U+0259><U+02C8>wi<U+02D0><U+0259>}}) is the most widely used spelling of her name, and is pronounced with a hard "g" sound, rather than a soft "g" or "j" sound.  Lewis and Clark's original journals mention Sacagawea by name seventeen times, spelled eight different ways, each time with a "g".  Clark used ''Sahkahgarwea, Sahcahgagwea, Sarcargahwea'' and ''Sahcahgahweah'', while Lewis used ''Sahcahgahwea, Sahcahgarweah, Sahcargarweah'' and ''Sahcahgar Wea''.

The spelling ''Sacagawea'' was established in 1910 as the proper usage in government documents by the United States [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], and is the spelling adopted by the [[United States Mint]] for use with the [[Sacagawea dollar|dollar coin]], as well as the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] and the U.S. [[National Park Service]].  The spelling is used by a large number of historical scholars.<ref>[http://libraries.idaho.gov/node/262 "Reading Lewis and Clark - Thomasma, Clark, and Edmonds"], Idaho Commission for Libraries</ref>

===Sakakawea===
''Sakakawea'' {{IPA-en|s<U+0259><U+02CC>k<U+0251><U+02D0>k<U+0259><U+02C8>wi<U+02D0><U+0259>|}} is the next most widely adopted spelling, and the most often accepted among specialists.<ref>Koontz, John. [http://spot.colorado.edu/~koontz/faq/etymology.htm ''Etymology'']. Siouan Languages. Retrieved 2007-04-01</ref>  Proponents say the name comes from the [[Hidatsa language]] ''tsak<U+00E1>ka w<U+00ED>a'', "bird woman".<ref>Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names in the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 413</ref><ref>Hartley, Alan H. (2002). ''Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas Newsletter'' '''20'''.4:12-13</ref>   Charbonneau told expedition members that his wife's name meant "Bird Woman", and in May 1805 Lewis used the Hidatsa meaning in his journal:
:"a handsome river of about fifty yards in width discharged itself into the shell river...this stream we called Sah-ca-gah-we-ah or bird woman<U+2019>s River, after our interpreter the Snake woman." 

Sakakawea is the official spelling of her name according to the [[Three Affiliated Tribes]], which include the [[Hidatsa]], and is widely used throughout [[North Dakota]] (where she is considered a state heroine), notably in the naming of [[Lake Sakakawea]], the extensive reservoir of [[Garrison Dam]] on the [[Missouri River]].

The [[State Historical Society of North Dakota|North Dakota State Historical Society]] quotes Russell Reid's book ''Sakakawea: The Bird Woman'': 
: Her Hidatsa name, which Charbonneau stated meant "Bird Woman," should be spelled "Tsakakawias" according to the foremost Hidatsa language authority, Dr. [[Washington Matthews]]. When this name is anglicized for easy pronunciation, it becomes Sakakawea, "Sakaka" meaning "bird" and "wea" meaning "woman." This is the spelling adopted by North Dakota. The spelling authorized for the use of Federal agencies by the United States Geographic Board is Sacagawea. Although not closely following Hidatsa spelling, the pronunciation is quite similar and the Geographic Board acknowledged the name to be a Hidatsa word meaning "Bird Woman."<ref>Reid, Russell. ''Sakakawea: The Bird Woman''. Bismarck: State Historical Society of North Dakota, 1986, as quoted in the State Historical Society of North Dakota document [http://www.nd.gov/hist/Sakakawea.htm#Spelling%20Sakakawea ''Language Authority''], Rev. C. L. Hall, Retrieved 2007-12-12</ref>

However, Irving W. Anderson, president of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, argued:
:...the Sakakawea spelling similarly is not found in the Lewis and Clark journals. To the contrary, this spelling traces its origin neither through a personal connection with her nor in any primary literature of the expedition. It has been independently constructed from two Hidatsa Indian words found in a dictionary titled ''Ethnography and Philology of the Hidatsa Indians'', published by the Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1877.  Compiled by a United States Army surgeon, Dr. Washington Matthews, 65 years following Sacagawea's death, the words appear verbatim in the dictionary as "tsa-ka-ka, noun; a bird," and "mia [wia, bia], noun; a woman.<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, Irving W.

===Sacajawea===
The name ''Sacajawea'' or ''Sacajewea'' {{IPA-en|<U+02CC>s<U+00E6>k<U+0259>d<U+0292><U+0259><U+02C8>wi<U+02D0><U+0259>|}}, in contrast to the Hidatsa etymology, is said to be derived from [[Shoshone language|Shoshone]] ''Saca-tzaw-meah,'' meaning "boat puller" or "boat launcher".<ref name="Anderson" />  It is the preferred spelling used by the Lemhi Shoshone people, some of whom claim that her Hidatsa captors merely reinterpreted her existing Shoshone name in their own language, and pronounced it in their own dialect<ref name="Legend">"[http://www.sacajaweahome.com/name.htm The Legend of Her Name]", Lemhi County Historical Museum</ref> -- they heard a name that approximated "tsakaka" and "wia", and interpreted it as "bird woman", substituting the hard "g/k" pronunciation for the softer "tz/j" sound that did not exist in the Hidatsa language.

The usage of this spelling almost certainly originated from the use of the "j" spelling by [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], who annotated the Lewis and Clark Expedition's journals for publication in 1814. This usage became more widespread with the publication of the 1902 novel, ''The Conquest: The True Story of Lewis and Clark'', written by Eva Emery Dye. It is likely Dye used Biddle's secondary source for the spelling, and her highly popular book made it ubiquitous throughout the United States (previously most non-scholars had never even heard of Sacagawea).<ref>"[The Lewis and Clark Expedition] merited less than a single paragraph in John Clark Ridpath's 691-page ''Popular History of the United States of America'' (1878)." [...] "Within three years of publication of Dye's novel the first book devoted exclusively to Sacagawea, Katherine Chandler's ''The Bird-Woman of the Lewis and Clark Expedition'', appeared as a supplementary reader for elementary school students."  [Chandler's book used the "Sacajawea" spelling.] Dippie, Brian W. "[http://www.windriverhistory.org/exhibits/sacajawea/sac01.htm Sacagawea Imagery]", ''Chief Washakie Foundation''</ref>

Rozina George, great-great-great-great-grandaughter of [[Cameahwait]], says the Agaidika tribe of Lemhi Shoshone do not recognize the spelling or pronunciation ''Sacagawea'', and schools and other memorials erected in the area surrounding her birthplace use the spelling ''Sacajawea.''

:"The Lemhi Shoshone call her Sacajawea. It is derived from the Shoshone word for her name, Saca tzah we yaa. In his Cash Book, William Clark spells Sacajawea with a <U+201C>J<U+201D>. Also, William Clark and Private George Shannon explained to Nicholas Biddle (Published the first Lewis and Clark Journals in 1814) about the pronunciation of her name and how the tz sounds more like a <U+201C>j<U+201D>. What better authority on the pronunciation of her name than Clark and Shannon who traveled with her and constantly heard the pronunciation of her name?  We do not believe it is a Minnetaree (Hidatsa) word for her name. Sacajawea was a Lemhi Shoshone not a Hidatsa."<ref name=George/>

Idaho native John Rees explored the "boat launcher" etymology in a long letter to the United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs written in the 1920s; it was republished in 1970 by The Lemhi County Historical Society as a pamphlet titled "Madame Charbonneau" and contains many of the arguments in favor of the Shoshone derivation of the name.<ref name="Legend" /><ref name="Anderson" />

The spelling ''Sacajawea'', though widely taught until the late 20th century, is generally considered incorrect in modern academia.  Linguistics professor Dr. Sven Liljeblad from the [[Idaho State University]] in [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] has concluded that "it is unlikely that Sacajawea is a Shoshoni word.... The term for 'boat' in Shoshoni is saiki, but the rest of the alleged compound would be incomprehensible to a native speaker of Shoshoni."<ref name="Anderson" />  The spelling has subsided from general use, although the corresponding "soft j" pronunciation persists in American culture.

===Fiction===

Two early twentieth-century novels shaped much of the public perception of Sacagawea.  ''The Conquest: The True Story of Lewis and Clark'', was written by American [[suffrage|suffragist]] [[Eva Emery Dye]] and published in 1902 in anticipation of the expedition's centennial.  The [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] embraced her as a female hero, and numerous stories and essays about her appeared in ladies' journals.  A few decades later, ''Sacagawea'' (1933) by Grace Hebard was published to even greater success.

Sacagawea has since become a popular figure in historical and young adult novels, including the long 1984 novel ''[[Sacajawea (novel)|Sacajawea]]'' by [[Anna Lee Waldo]].

Some fictional accounts of the expedition speculate that Sacagawea was romantically involved with Lewis or Clark during their expedition.  While the journals show that she was friendly with Clark and would often do favors for him, the idea of a romantic liaison was created by novelists who wrote about the expedition much later.  This fiction was perpetuated in the 1955 [[Western (genre)|Western]] film ''[[The Far Horizons]]''.
