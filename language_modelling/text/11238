"'''Hairography'''" is the eleventh episode of the [[United States|American]] television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The episode premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on November 25, 2009. It was written by series creator [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]] and directed by [[Bill D'Elia]]. The episode introduces New Directions' rival [[glee club]]s, the Jane Addams Girls Choir for girls recently released from [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention]], and the Haverbrook Deaf Choir. Cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]) sabotages New Directions by giving their set-list for [[sectionals]] to the competing clubs. [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) reconsiders having her baby adopted, but ultimately recommits to the idea, and [[Rachel Berry|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) tries unsuccessfully to attract [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]).

Rapper [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]] guest-stars as Grace Hitchens, director of the Jane Addams Girls Choir, and ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (season 4)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' contestants [[Katee Shean]], [[Kherington Payne]] and [[Comfort Fedoke]] appear as members of her group. The episode features covers of eight songs, including a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] of "[[Hair (song)|Hair]]" from the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" by [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles|Beyonc<U+00E9>]]. [[Studio recording]]s of all but one of the songs performed in the episode were released as [[Single (music)|singles]], available for [[Music download|digital download]].

"Hairography" was watched by 6.1 million US viewers and received mixed reviews from critics. Raymund Flandez of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' deemed the mash-up performance one of the worst of the season, with [[Zap2it]]'s Liz Pardue agreeing that it was "hideous".<ref name="Zap"/> Flandez, Pardue and Mike Hale of the ''[[New York Times]]'' all felt that it was inappropriate for New Directions to interrupt the deaf choir's performance of "Imagine", however Bobby Hankinson of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' opined that reviewers needed to "realize that this show takes its jabs at everyone, but it always has a wink and a hug and lots and lots of love behind it".<ref name="HC"/>

==Plot==
New Directions' director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) suspects that cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] has been colluding with rival [[glee club]]s, and visits the Jane Addams Academy for girls recently released from [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention]]. When their club director Grace Hitchens ([[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]]) reveals the extent of the school's under-funding, Will invites her club to perform in the McKinley High auditorium. Will is intimidated by their opposition, but [[Rachel Berry|Rachel]] ([[Lea Michele]]) assures him that the girls are using the power of "hairography"&mdash;frequent, dramatic hair-tossing&mdash;to distract from the fact their singing and dancing ability is limited. Will purchases wigs for New Directions and has them utilize hairography themselves, performing a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] of "[[Hair (song)|Hair]]" and "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]". Dalton Rumba ([[Michael Hitchcock]]), glee club director at Haverbrook School for the Deaf, feels slighted by the invitation Will extended to the Jane Addams Academy, and arranges for his own club to also perform at McKinley High. His club duets with New Directions on [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]", and Will realizes that the new mash-up and hairography routine is not working. He removes it from the club's set-list, replacing it with a performance of "[[True Colors (song)|True Colors]]". Unbeknownst to Will, Sue reveals two songs from New Directions' line-up for [[sectionals]] to Grace and Dalton, suggesting they have their own clubs perform them to gain an edge in the competition.

[[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] begins to doubt her decision to give her baby to Will's wife [[Terri Schuester|Terri]] ([[Jessalyn Gilsig]]), and re-considers her stance on raising the baby with [[Noah Puckerman|Puck]] instead of [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] . She tells Terri she wants to keep the baby, but in an effort to change her mind, Terri's sister Kendra ([[Jennifer Aspen]]) has Quinn babysit her three unruly sons. Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening [[sexting]] his ex-girlfriend [[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father. Elsewhere, [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) gives Rachel a make-over, ostensibly to help her attract Finn, but in reality attempting to sabotage her chances with him. Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having the conversation with Kurt about what he liked in girls. Rachel confronts Kurt, stating that even if he is in love with Finn, she will always have a better chance "because [she's] a girl". But Kurt tells her that they are both kidding themselves: Finn is in love with Quinn and nothing will change that.

Pardue also criticized the mash-up of "Hair" and "Crazy in Love" as "hideous".<ref name="Zap">{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/ithappenedlastnight/2009/11/glee-true-colors-shine-through-the-hairography.html|title='Glee': 'True Colors' shine through the 'Hairography'|last=Pardue|first=Liz|date=November 25, 2009|work=[[Zap2it]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}</ref>
