{{Paleolithic}}

[[Religious behaviour]] is thought to have emerged by the [[Upper Paleolithic]], before 30,000 years ago at the latest,<ref>Andre Leroi-Gourhan and Annette Michelson, '' The Religion of the Caves: Magic or Metaphysics?'', October 37, The MIT Press, pp. 6-17. "[[cave art]] born 30,000 years before our era ... would appear to have developed simultaneously with the first explicit manifestations of concern with the supernatural." (p. 6)

but behavioral patterns such as [[burial rite]]s that one might characterize as religious - or as ancestral to religious behaviour - reach back into the [[Middle Paleolithic]], as early as 300,000 years ago, coinciding with the first appearance of ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Religious behaviour may combine (for example) [[religion and ritual|ritual]], [[spirituality]], [[myth and religion|mythology]] and [[Magic and religion|magical thinking]] or [[animism]] - aspects that may have had separate histories of development during the Middle Paleolithic before combining into "religion proper" of [[behavioral modernity]].

There are suggestions for the first appearance of religious or spiritual experience in the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (significantly earlier than 300,000 years ago, pre-''Homo sapiens''), but these remain controversial and have limited support.<ref>see e.g. [http://www.originsnet.org/mindold.html Oldowan Art, Religion, Symbols, Mind by  James Harrod and Vincent W.

==Middle Paleolithic==
The Middle Paleolithic (Middle Stone Age) spans the period from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some of the earliest significant evidence of religious practices dates from this period. Intentional [[burial]], particularly with [[grave goods]] may be one of the earliest detectable forms of religious practice since, as [[Philip Lieberman]] suggests, it may signify a "concern for the dead that transcends daily life."<ref name="lieberman">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&pg=PA162&dq=Uniquely+Human+cognitive-linguistic+base&ei=nNUeR9fmBo74pwKwtKnMDg&sig=3UsvgAnE5B-vzb55I6W6OqqhJy4| title=Uniquely Human|isbn=0674921836| year=1991| authorlink=Philip Lieberman}}</ref> Though disputed, evidence suggests that the [[Neanderthals]] were the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead, doing so in shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The World's Largest Neanderthal Finding Site  |url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23639&pregled=1&datum=9.1.2009%2015:00:13 |publisher=Culturenet |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> Exemplary sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq, [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel and [[Krapina]] in Croatia. Some scholars, however argue that these bodies may have been disposed of for [[secular]] reasons.<ref name="evolving_graves">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1 Evolving in their graves: early burials hold clues to human origins - research of burial rituals of Neanderthals]</ref>
According to {{As of| 2010 | alt = recent}} archeological findings from ''[[H. heidelbergensis]]'' sites in [[Atapuerca]], humans may have begun burying their dead much earlier during the late [[Lower Paleolithic]] but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community. Cut marks on Neanderthal bones from various sites such as [[Combe-Grenal]] and [[Abri Moula]] in [[France]] may imply that the [[Neanderthal#Ritual defleshing|Neanderthals]] like [[Excarnation|some contemporary human cultures]] may have practiced [[excarnation]] for religious reasons.

Likewise a number of archeologists propose that Middle Paleolithic societies - such as that of the Neanderthals - may also have practiced the earliest form of [[totemism]] or [[animal worship]] in addition to their (presumably religious) burial of the dead. Emil B<U+00E4>chler in particular suggests (based on archeological evidence from Middle Paleolithic caves) that a widespread [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Neanderthal]] [[bear worship|bear-cult]] existed ([[#Reference-idWunn2000|Wunn, 2000]], p.&nbsp;434-435). A claim that evidence was found for [[Middle Paleolithic]] animal worship [[circa|c]] 70,000 BC originates from the [[Tsodilo Hills]] in the African Kalahari desert has been denied by the original investigators of the site.<ref>World's Oldest Ritual Discovered -- Worshipped The Python 70,000 Years Ago The Research Council of Norway (2006, November 30).

Animal cults in the following Upper Paleolithic period - such as the bear cult - may have had their origins in these hypothetical Middle Paleolithic animal cults.<ref name=Narr>{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&fullArticle=true&tocId=52333 |author=Karl J.

The earliest undisputed [[homo sapiens|human]] burial dates back 90,000 years. Human skeletal remains stained with [[red ochre]] were discovered{{By whom|date=May 2010}} in the [[Skhul]] cave at [[Qafzeh]], Israel. A variety of grave goods were present at the site, including the mandible of a wild boar in the arms of one of the skeletons.<ref name="lieberman2">

The anatomically modern human emigrants from Africa inhabiting the Middle East during that time, as opposed to the Neanderthals, may have invented this form of [[ritual]]ized burial practice.<ref name="lieberman2"/> Middle stone age sites in Africa dating to around the same time-frame also show an increased use of [[red ochre]], a pigment thought to have only [[symbol]]ic value.<ref name="religous_mind">[http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/EvolOfReligionFinal.pdf The Religious Mind and the Evolution of Religion]</ref><ref>[http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/mcbrearty/Pdf/McB%202003%20CA%20Comment%20on%20Hovers.pdf An early case of color symbolism]</ref><ref>[http://www.anth.uconn.edu/faculty/sosis/publications/ritualalcortasosis5.pdf Ritual, Emotion, and Sacred Symbols: The Evolution of Religion as an Adaptive Complex]</ref>
These findings have led researchers like Lieberman to believe that the religious mind has been in existence for at least 100,000 years.

Other scholars{{Who|date=July 2009}} believe that religion only appeared around 50,000 years ago during the transition from the middle to the [[Upper Paleolithic]].  Increasing evidence of burial with grave goods and the appearance of [[anthropomorphic]] images and cave paintings may suggest that humans in the Upper Paleolithic had begun to believe in supernatural beings.<ref name="mithen">{{cite book| authorlink=Steve Mithen|isbn=0-500-05081-3| title=The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science| year=1996| publisher=Thames & Hudson}}</ref>
The cave paintings of [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] have been dated to 32,000 and those at [[Lascaux]] to 17,000 years ago. At Lascaux the anthropomorphic paintings show depictions of strange beasts such as ones that are half-human and half-bird and half-human and half-lion. Consequently some{{Who|date=July 2009}} have seen these as indications of [[Shamanism|shamanistic beliefs]].<ref>{{cite book|chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=11Em-3BOTTUC&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=shamanism+chauvet&source=web&ots=ATXw7tauhf&sig=sFrEcBU2u6WmoXBafUZl5TjYxc8#PPA39,M1|chapter=Poesy en Masse|title=The Strong Eye of Shamanism|year=1999|last=Ryan|isbn=0892817097}}</ref>

The earliest known undisputed burial of a [[shaman]]{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} dates back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] era ([[Circa|c.]] 30,000 BC) in the area of the present-day [[Czech Republic]].<ref name="Tedlock, Barbara 2005">Tedlock, Barbara. 2005.

However, it was probably more common during the early Upper Paleolithic for religious ceremonies to receive equal and full participation from all members of the band in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests  and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&q=paleolithic+society&dq=paleolithic+society&pgis=1  Stavrianos, pg 10]</ref>
The earliest known Paleolithic shaman (c.30,000 BC) was female.{{dubious|date=December 2010}}<ref name="Tedlock, Barbara 2005"/>  Additionally it is also possible that Upper Paleolithic religions - like contemporary and historical [[Animism|animistic]] and [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] religions - believed in the existence of a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as [[animistic]] spirits.<ref>{{cite book |title=From earth spirits to sky gods Socioecological Origins of Monotheism|last= Lerro |first=Bruce |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qs5RqLdx1HgC&pg=PA17&vq=Paleolithic&source=gbs_search_r&cad=0_2&sig=L5zGzwZukHYfyvJ5VnR0i5kx8Sk#PPA17,M1 |year=2000 |publisher=Lexington Press |location= Lanham MD |isbn=073910098X |pages=327 }} pages 17<U+2013>20

Vincent W. Fallio writes that [[Ancestor worship|ancestor cults]] first emerged in complex Upper Paleolithic societies. Vincent W. Fallio argues that the elites of complex Upper Paleolithic societies (like the elites of many contemporary complex hunter-gatherers such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]) may have used special rituals and ancestor worship to solidify control over their societies by convincing their subjects that they possess a link to the spirit world that gives them control over both the earthly realm and access to the spiritual realm.<ref name="V.Fallio">{{cite book | author=Vincent W.

[[Secret societies]] may have served a similar function in these complex quasi-[[theocratic]] societies by dividing the religious practices of these cultures into the separate spheres of popular religion and elite religion.<ref name="V.Fallio"/>

Religion was often [[apotropaism|apotropaic]]; specifically, it involved sympathetic magic.<ref name=Miller2006>{{cite book |title= |last=Miller |first=Barbra |coauthors=Bernard Wood, Andrew Balansky, Julio Mercader, Melissa Panger |year=2006 |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston Massachusetts |isbn= 0205320244  | pages= 768}}</ref>
The [[Venus figurines]] - which occur abundantly in the Upper Paleolithic archeological record - provide an example of Paleolithic sympathetic magic: people may have used them for ensuring success in hunting and to bring about fertility of the land and women.<ref name="McClellan">{{cite book | author=McClellan|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aJgp94zNwNQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA11 | title=Science and Technology in World History: An Introduction| location=Baltimore, Maryland | publisher=JHU Press
