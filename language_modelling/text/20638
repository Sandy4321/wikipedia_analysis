Realistically coloured with vegetable dyes, they are said to have originated at the [[Martorana|Monastero della Martorana]], Palermo, when nuns decorated empty fruit trees with marzipan fruit to impress an archbishop visiting at [[Easter]]. They are traditionally put by children's bedsides on [[All Saints|All Saints Day]].
