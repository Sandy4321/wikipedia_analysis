'''Pauline Joran''' (1870 <U+2013> 13 August 1954) was an American-born [[opera singer]] and violinist. She was the wife of [[William Ernest Bush]], the first and last Baron de Bush, and mother of Paulise de Bush, the "Baby Baroness".  She is remembered for creating the role of Saida in [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s 1898 [[Savoy opera]] ''[[The Beauty Stone]]''.

After a touring career as a child violinist, playing together with her pianist sisters in the U.S. and abroad in the 1880s, Joran began an opera career in England, which lasted through the 1890s.  With her marriage to Baron de Bush in 1899, she retired from the stage.  He was killed in an accident in 1903, and Joran lived quietly for some years, returning to society by 1910 as a hostess and patroness of music.  

==Early life==
[[Image:1880s photographs of the Joran Quartette.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Joran Quartet, circa 1884.]]
Joran was born '''Clara Pauline Joran''' in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in 1870, the second daughter of Louis Grund Joran, a musician, and his wife, an English pianist.  She made her violin debut, at age 11, forming a concert troupe with her pianist sisters, Lulu (two years older) and Elise (two years younger).<ref name=Timesobit>"Baroness de Bush", ''The Times'', 27 August 1954, p. 8</ref>  Their director, the fourth member of the quartet, was Miss M. Hyde who also acted as an accompanist.<ref name=mba>Blake-Alverson, Margaret, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19528/19528-h/19528-h.htm ''Sixty Years of California Song''] (1913), full text at Gutenberg Project</ref> The children's talents were much admired at the time, especially their skill at [[absolute pitch]] and their ability to tell the notes of [[chord (music)|chords]] sounded whilst blindfolded.<ref name=mba/>  The troupe visited California, Mexico and Australia, among others.  In [[Hawaii]], they played for the last king, [[Kal<U+0101>kaua]].<ref name=Timesobit/>

Joran underwent preliminary [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] in 1884<U+2013>85 with the singer Margaret Blake-Alverson, who had described her as singing with taste and feeling, as well as being a talented violinist.<ref name=mba/>  In 1885, they performed for the famous opera singer [[Adelina Patti]].<ref>Neville, Amelia Ransome, ''The Fantastic City'', chapter 9.(Massachusetts, 1932)</ref>  In the latter part of the 1880s, the Jorans travelled to Europe to further their musical studies.<ref name=Timesobit/>

==Operatic career==
In London, as a debutante, Joran was recommended to the conductor [[Wilhelm Ganz]].  As a member of the New Meistersingers' Club in [[St James's Street]], Ganz arranged musical soirees for which he held auditions for potential performers. He found that Joran played the violin well, and that she had a lovely [[soprano]] voice.<ref name=ganz>Ganz, Wilhelm, ''Memories of a Musician'', pp. 281<U+2013>83 (1913)</ref> Ganz advised her to give up playing the violin and take to the operatic stage, as she was a very good-looking young woman with a beautiful figure.<ref name=ganz/>  Nevertheless, Joran did not abandon the violin, playing [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''G minor Violin Concerto'' in Liverpool in 1893 and, as late as December 1896, giving a concert at [[St James's Hall]], London, as both violinist and vocalist.<ref name=mw>[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/GaS/newsletters/gossip/no39/gg39_10.html "Some Comments on Original Artists",] ''Gilbertian Gossip'' no. 39, Winter 1992-93, online at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Newsletter Archive''</ref>

Meanwhile, with a recommendation from Ganz, Joran was engaged by the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]], making her London stage debut in the [[mezzo-soprano]] roles of Lola in ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and Beppe in the UK premiere of ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'', which opened on 24 September 1892 at the Prince's Theatre, [[Manchester]].  The latter required her to sing and play the violin simultaneously, enabling her to showcase both her talents.<ref name=mw/><ref>''''[[The Musical Times]]'', October 1892, p. 611</ref> ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' wrote that she played the violin "like an angel" and then surprised her audience with the excellence of her singing.<ref>''The Manchester Guardian'', 29 September 1892, p. 8</ref>  

She was well-received and was soon engaged by Sir [[Augustus Harris]] to be one of his [[prima donna]]s at the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]], at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], and on tour.<ref>''The Musical Times'', October 1894, p. 692</ref>  Joran's roles over the next four years included Marguerite in ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', the title role in ''[[Carmen]]'' (which she also played at the [[Garrick Theatre]]), Nedda in ''[[Pagliacci]]'', Alice Ford in ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', Anita in ''[[La Navarraise]]'', Lady Pamela in ''[[Fra Diavolo (opera)|Fra Diavolo]]'', and roles in ''[[Maritana]]'', ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', ''[[Orfeo]]'', ''[[Die Walk<U+00FC>re]]'', ''[[Rom<U+00E9>o et Juliette]]'', ''The Lady of Longford'', as well as the role of Gertrude in an [[opera bouffe]] called ''[[il maestro di cappella|Il Maestro di Cappella]]'' at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]].<ref name=ganz/><ref>''The Musical Times, June 1896, p. 383</ref> An 1896 review said of her, "Mlle. Pauline Joran is a bewitching Carmen. She sings and acts the part to the life. She is a true artiste."<ref>Waftings from the Wings, ''Fun'' , 14 April 1896, p.150</ref> She also sang in Italy during 1895<U+2013>96.<ref name=Who>Stone, David.

Joran created the role of Saida in the premiere of ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', by [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[A. W. Pinero]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]], at the [[Savoy Theatre]], on May 28, 1898. She was one of two [[opera singer]]s imported into the regular Savoy cast, which included [[Henry Lytton]] (who became her life-long friend),<ref name=Timesobit/> at increased salaries to tackle the music, which was considered more challenging than other [[Savoy opera]]s.  Cunningham Bridgeman deemed her "unquestionably the finest prima donna ever seen on the Savoy stage".<ref>Coles, Clifton.

==Marriage and later years==
[[Image:Baron de Bush.jpg|thumb|left|100px|The Baron de Bush c.1894-95]]
On December 6, 1899, Joran married [[William Ernest Bush]], the Baron de Bush, and retired from performing. They had a daughter together, Paulise Mary Louise (1900<U+2013>1975). In March 1903 Joran made a brief return to performing, singing at a concert at St. James's Hall, presented by her sister, the pianist Elise Joran.<ref>''The Musical Times'', March 1903, p. 186</ref>  On July 24 that year, the Baron de Bush was killed after falling in front of a express train near [[Northampton]], while he and his wife were travelling up to [[Scotland]].<ref>''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E02E3DA1739E433A25756C2A9619C946297D6CF "Baron de Bush Killed; Well-Known Chemist Falls in Front of a Train in England - Married Miss Pauline Joran]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 25, 1903</ref> This left their daughter the Baroness de Bush, England's youngest Baroness.<ref>Exhibition Catalogue of the 1905 Fiftieth Annual Exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain, p. 42</ref>

Joran lived quietly for several years, but by 1910, she had re-entered social life, becoming a well-known hostess and patroness of music.<ref name=Timesobit/>  She was a member of the Society of American Women in London and attended the events they hosted, such as a farewell dinner held for [[Charles W. Fairbanks]] in London on March 12, 1910. By this time, she was out of [[mourning]], as she was noted to be wearing ''fraise'' (strawberry pink).<ref>''The New York Times'', March 13, 1910</ref> She presented private concerts at her house in [[Regent's Park]], featuring well-known singers.<ref>''Play Pictorial'', November 1925, p. 1</ref>

Joran died in 1954 in London.<ref>Obituaries, ''The Times'', 16 August 1954, p. 8</ref> She was survived by her daughter Paulise, an active collector of historical dress who bequeathed her collection to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. The Paulise de Bush collection is housed and exhibited at [[Killerton|Killerton House]], [[Broadclyst]], near [[Exeter (city)|Exeter]]. A number of pieces from Pauline Joran's 1899 wedding trousseau and some of her fashionable evening garments are preserved in the collection.
