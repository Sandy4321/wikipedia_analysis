The treaty was signed in [[San Saba County, Texas]], but named after the nearest military outpost, [[Fort Martin Scott]] in [[Gillespie County, Texas|Gillespie County]], on the outskirts of [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]].

==Background==

The [[Fort Martin Scott]] Treaty was negotiated and signed on December 10, 1850 by Indian agent John Rollins, U. S. Army Captain Hamilton W. Merrill, Captain J.B. McGown of the Texas Mounted Volunteers (Texas Rangers),<ref>{{cite book|last=Reilly|first=John|title=Larry McMurtry: A Critical Companion|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0313303005|page=92}}</ref> interpretors John Connor and Jesse Chisholm, as well as twelve [[Comanche]] chiefs, six [[Caddo]] chiefs, five [[Quapaw]] chiefs, four [[Tawakoni]] chiefs, four [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]] chiefs and four [[Waco people|Waco]] chiefs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Larry S|title=INDIAN TREATIES 1835 to 1902 Vol. XXII - Kiowa, Comanche and Apache|year=1994|publisher=Histree|pages=15<U+2013>19}}</ref>

Work on the contract was done primarily by Jesse Chisholm and John Connor, a [[Lenape|Delaware]] chief,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoig|first=Stan|title=Tribal Wars of the Southern Plains|year=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0806124636|page=168}}</ref> under the direction of [[Robert Neighbors]] and John Ford.  John H.

On December 25, 1850, General George M.

TREATY WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES OF TEXAS 1850

10 December 1850

(unratified)

Headquarters 8th Military Department

San Antonio, December 25, 1850

Orders
No. 69

The accompanying Treaty held on the [[San Saba River|San Saba]] by the United States Agent, with the Comanches and other tribes of Texas Indians, is published for the information of all concerned.

Notwithstanding that this Treaty still requires the sanction of the General Government at Texas to make it binding by law, it still evinces a disposition on the part of the Indians to preserve a peaceable attitude towards the whites.

Officers of the Army within this Department are accordingly directed to carry out the spirit of this Treaty so far as can consistently be done, and it is also hoped that a spirit of accommodation may be evinced by the citizens of Texas, until such a time as the question of Indian boundary and military jurisdiction over their country can be determined upon by the proper authorities.

By order of Bvt. Maj. General George M. Brooke

(signed) George Deas
Asst. Agt. Gen.
