==History==
When Clyattville was first settled, there were only a few families to establish residence. Some of the families were the following: the Brays, the Hunters, the Lanes, the Arnolds, the Covingtons, the Quillians, and of course, the Clyatts. It was reported that Clyattville was named after the Clyatt family since they were the first settlers.

The community has not always been at its present site. Once it was located two miles northwest on the Old Clyattville Rd. It was said that the reason for moving the original location was the fact that a railroad was constructed through the community which caused to much noise. The first train that ran through Clyattville was known as the Coast Line.

The first store in Clyattville was owned by the Bray family. Since that time, several stores have been established. Some were and are; Zipperer's Grocery (located across the street from the Clyattville Elementary School), a Minit-Mart, now a Holiday Market, (on the Lake Park-Clyattville Highway), J.W.'s Grocery (located on the Madison Highway), Clyattville 66 (located at the corner of the Madison Highway and the Lake Park-Clyattville Highway). There once was a grist mill, a cotton gin, a drug store, and only one church, the Methodist Church.

In the early stages of the settlement of Clyattville, it was mainly an agricultural region. In the early 1950's, Owens Illinois built a paper mill and bag plant. Before the paper mill was constructed, the community thrived on farming. There was a cotton gin which was owned by Mr. C.A. Baucom.

The people had to travel by buggies or wagon until one could afford a car. The first person to own a car in Clyattville was Dr. Quillian. His office was a wooden building in Olympia (the old saw mill by the river) at the railroad track.

Clyattville is definitely a community that has changed since the times of their fore-fathers. One cannot say that Clyattville is an area that is continuously increasing in population or undergoing industrial changes.
