'''Assembly Square''' is a mixed-use, [[smart growth]] development planned for {{convert|66.5|acre|m2}} along the [[Mystic River]] in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]. The site is two miles (3 km) from downtown Boston and accessible via I-93 and Route 28/[[Middlesex Fells]] Parkway.

Currently under redevelopment by Federal Realty Investment Trust, the new Assembly Square will combine retail, residential and commercial office space.

Moore]], [[Sports Authority]], [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], [[TJMaxx]], [[Kmart]], and [[Bed Bath & Beyond]].  

The next phase of development is expected to begin in 2009 with the building of a new [[IKEA]] store.<ref>http://bostonherald.com/business/general/view/2008_11_27_Work_on_Ikea_put_off_to__09:_Part_of__1_3B_Somerville_plan/srvc=home&position=7</ref> Subsequent phases will include the development of a new main street providing premium retail and residential space, state-of-the-art office and [[research and development]] space, [[Assembly Square (MBTA station)|a new]] [[MBTA Orange Line]] mass transit station (projected opening, 2013) and the renewal of the waterfront along the Mystic River with parks and other green space.
