'''''[[Russell Corporation|Russell Athletic]] ESPN Arena Football''''' is a presentation of the [[Arena Football League]] on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]], [[ESPN Radio]] and [[ESPN on ABC]]. The telecasts are simulcast on [[ESPNHD]], [[ESPN2HD]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC HD]]. The agreement will run from the [[2007 Arena Football League season|2007]] season opener and lasts five years through the end of the 2011 season.

The official name for the [[ESPN2]] Monday night games is called ''ESPN Arena Football Monday presented by Russell Athletic''.

==History==
[[ESPN]] was the orginal broadcaster for Arena Football games, showing games live in the league's first two seasons, [[1987 Arena Football League season|1987]] and [[1988 Arena Football League season|1988]].  Partially because of turmoil within the league itself, ESPN did not broadcast Arena Football again until [[1992 Arena Football League season|1992]], when they broadcast 6 games and the ArenaBowl on an overnight, [[tape delay]] basis.  Starting in [[1993 Arena Football League season|1993]], ESPN started showing games live or at least not during overnight hours.  When [[ESPN2]] was formed, the telecasts began to air more frequently on the new network.

ESPN2 began televising a more standard schedule of [[Arena Football League]] regular season and playoff games from [[1995 Arena Football League season|1995]]-[[1999 Arena Football League season|1999]].

ESPN subsequently began televising AFL playoff games from [[2000 Arena Football League season|2000]]-[[2002 Arena Football League season|02]]. 

It originally had aired the inaugural [[ArenaBowl]] live in [[1987 Arena Football League season|1987]], while [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired the ArenaBowl five consecutive years from [[1998 Arena Football League season|1998]]&ndash;[[2002 Arena Football League season|02]]. 

===Agreement===
On December 19, 2006, [[ESPN]] and the [[Arena Football League]] agreed to a five-year agreement that includes extensive multimedia rights and a minimum of 26 televised games per season, beginning in 2007 and lasting until 2011. As part of the deal, [[ESPN]] purchased a minority stake, reportedly ten percent, in the AFL. The network will gain privileged financial information, but insists that it will not give the AFL more favorable coverage on shows like ''[[SportsCenter]]'' as a result.<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6401201.html ESPN Buys Stake in the Arena Football League - 12/19/2006 11:35:00 AM - Broadcasting & Cable]</ref>
[[ESPN]] will televise a minimum of 17 regular-season games and nine playoff games -- including a minimum of three Wild Card games, three Divisional Playoff games, both Conference Championships and the [[ArenaBowl]] on [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. [[ESPN]] will also have an exclusive window for weekly Monday night primetime games on [[ESPN2]]. Both the season opener and [[ArenaBowl]] will be on ABC, where three wild card games, two divisional games and one conference championship will be on ESPN and the seventeen regular season Monday night games, one wild card game, two divisional games and one conference championship game will all be on ESPN2.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>''Schedule change''

==Personalities==
Former broadcasters of the AFL on [[ESPN]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] included [[Mike Gleason]], [[Gary Danielson]], [[Brent Musburger]], [[Merril Hoge]], and [[Holly Rowe]].

===2007===
Early on, [[ESPN]] said they would use "some prominent faces in the broadcast booth" and ended up going with the popular duo of [[Mike Greenberg]] and [[Mike Golic]] from [[ESPN Radio]] and [[ESPN2]]'s ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' for their number one team. The second team will consist of ''[[NFL Live]]'''s [[Trey Wingo]] and [[Mark Schlereth]] with the third being [[Ron Jaworski]] and [[Merril Hoge]]. On May 2007, [[Mark Jones (sports journalist)|Mark Jones]] replaced Jaworski, who focuses on his new ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' role. Jay Rothman, producer of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'',  and Bryan Ryder will also produce the Monday night Arena Football games on ESPN2.  The announcements were made on January 16, 2007.<ref>[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/local/orl-arena2006dec20,0,6508742.story?coll=orl-sports-headlines Topic Galleries - OrlandoSentinel.com]</ref><ref>[http://media.espn.com/ESPNToday/index.jsp?content=content.html ESPN MediaZone - A Resource for Media Professionals]</ref>.

The other play-by-play announcer used on playoff games is [[Bob Wischusen]]. 

===2008===
Pasch, Wischusen, and Bentley returned to their respective roles while [[Marcellus Wiley]] and [[Shaun King]] joined as color commentators. The highly publicized tandems of Greenberg-Golic and Wingo-Schlereth wouldn't reprise their roles as play-by-play men in 2008.

The replays of classic Arena Football games that had aired on [[ESPN Classic]] in 2007 would also be dropped in 2008.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3500&KEY=&ATCLID=1393645 ESPN announces 2008 AFL talent]. Arena Football League. 26 February 2008.</ref>

==Controversy==
Some [[Arena Football League|AFL]] fans are complaining that the TV schedule <U+201C>inequitably favors teams<U+201D> such as the [[Philadelphia Soul]], [[Chicago Rush]], and [[Colorado Crush]], teams whose ownerships include, respectively, [[Jon Bon Jovi]], [[Mike Ditka]] and [[John Elway]]. 14 of the 17 ESPN games had at least Chicago, Philadelphia or Colorado playing. The Soul (whose part-owner and team president is former ''AFL on ESPN'' analyst Ron Jaworski) have appeared in seven of the 17 regular season games on [[ESPN]] platforms, more than any other team in the league.<ref>[http://www.cable360.net/cfax/ CableFAX]</ref> This criticism was also present when [[AFL on NBC|NBC]] went out of their way to not let some teams appear on their schedule.  In 2008, the Chicago Rush have nine regular season games on ESPN and ABC, while the 2007 Arena Bowl Champion [[San Jose SaberCats]] have just one, week one against the Chicago Rush, and the [[New York Dragons]] had 1, a 10:30 game versus the [[Colorado Crush]]. Other criticism includes the scheduling of games on various days and times, as opposed to a weekly AFL gameday.
