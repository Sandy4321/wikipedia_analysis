Her father, a well-known and respected gentleman officer from [[County Cork]], was a [[lieutenant]] in the [[British Royal Navy]] and commanded the local [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard station]];<ref name="Who"/><ref name="Ward"/><ref name="Plarr"/><ref name="Sutherland">Sutherland, John.

Her mother was the daughter of Captain Alexander Mackey, a [[Officer Cadet#Royal Navy|Royal Navy cadet]] of the house of [[Lord Reay]], of Reay Forest.<ref name="BR">''The Biograph and Review''. Vol. V. London: E.W. Allen, 1881. (pg. 271-273)</ref>

Her family then moved to [[Morston]] in [[Norfolk]], where her father served until the year before his death in [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name="Ward"/> Primarily educated at home, Cudlip took up writing around this time and successfully submitted an article, "A Stroll in the Park", for the first issue of ''[[London Society]]''. She published her first novel, ''The Cross of Honor'', in 1863 at age 24. She followed this with her first 3-volume novel ''Sir Victor's Choice'' and ''Barry O'Byrne''<!--this is only two--> three months later. Following up on these successful novels, publisher [[William Tinsley (publisher)|William Tinsley]] published ''Denis Donne'' and ''Theo Leigh'' while [[Chapman & Hall]] released a series of her 3-volume novels including ''On Guard'', ''Played Out'', ''Walter Goring'', ''Called to Account'', ''The Dower House'', ''A Passion in Tatters'', ''Blotted Out'', ''A Narrow Escape'' and ''Mrs. Cardigan''.<ref name="Ward"/><ref name="Plarr"/><ref name="Newbolt"/><ref name="BR"/> Many of her earliest novels were considered highly controversial and dealt with subjects such as the sexuality of young girls {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and illegitimate pregnancy.<ref name="Sutherland"/> Her writing was often compared to that of [[Florence Marryat]]; the two were close childhood friends as their fathers were old colleagues and neighbours.<ref name="Kemp"/>

She was closely associated with William Tinsley throughout her literary career. Tinsley remarked in 1865, after her first two novels had been published by John Maxwell, that she was "a light-hearted girl, and a writer of bright, easy-reading fiction, of which she could write almost acres in a short time. But when she found time to write so much was often a puzzle to me, for she seemed always to be out and about. She was in a bright and merry set at the time, many of whom had 'at homes,' dinner parties, dances, and merry meetings of different kinds, including some theatre going." He further claimed that Cudlip could easily put out one of her 3-volume "triple-decker" novels in a mere six weeks.<ref name="Sutherland"/><ref name="Kemp"/><ref name="Newbolt"/>

After refusing an offer of marriage from [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1866,<ref>{{cite book|last=Ainger|first=Michael|year=2002|title=Gilbert and Sullivan<U+2013>A Dual Biography|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=52|isbn=0-19-514769-3}}</ref> she married Rev. [[Pender Hodge Cudlip]] on 10 July 1867;<ref name="Ward"/><ref name="Plarr"/><ref name="Werner"/><ref name="Loeber"/> they had six children.<ref name="BR"/> Rev. Cudlip was a High Church clergyman and amateur theological author.<ref name="Sutherland"/> The two lived in [[Devon]] for most of their married life.<ref name="Kemp"/>

In 1873, she and her husband moved to [[Paddington, London]], where they lived for eight years. She was involved in animal rights groups and wrote about [[animal cruelty]] in London during the period. Her favorite Stella setter had contracted [[rabies|hydrophobia]] and eventually had to be destroyed. A large [[greyhound]], Cavac, had been her constant companion for ten years and was one of the many dogs killed in the infamous [[London dog poisonings]] in 1876; she had included him as a character in her 1867 novel ''Called to Account''.<ref name="Sutherland"/> Two of her elder sons died in March of that year<!--which one?-->, and another son in February 1879.<ref name="BR"/> Of her three surviving children, one of her daughters married Major [[William Price Drury]], a [[Royal Marine]], who wrote some nautical novels at the end of the 20th century.<ref name="Sutherland"/>

Cudlip was the editor of ''Ours: A Holiday Quarterly''<ref name="Kemp"/> and a regular contributor to ''[[All the Year Round]]'', ''Appleton's Journal'', the ''Broadway'',<ref name="Loeber"/> [[Frank Leslie]]<U+2019>s ''Popular Monthly'' and other magazines in both Great Britain and the United States between 1876 and 1884. She also wrote serial novels for ''The Ladies' Pictorial'' and a group of other provincial journals.<ref name="BR"/>

She and her husband returned to Devon in 1884, where Pender Cudlip served was vicar of [[Sparkwell]] for the next 25 years.<ref name="Who"/><ref name="Plarr"/> She continued writing single-volume novels for such publishers as [[Chatto & Windus]] around the start of the 20th century.<ref name="Newbolt"/> However, she began experiencing financial problems within a few years and applied to the [[Royal Literary Fund]] in 1907 and 1908. In the latter year she claimed that the highest offer she had received for her latest novel was <U+00A3>15.<ref name="Kemp"/> Her husband died in 1911 and Annie Cudlip died seven years later on 24 November 1918.
