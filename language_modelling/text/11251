==Career==

===Youth career===

Vida has spent his entire youth career in Croatia, rising through the youth system and being first featured with the senior team in the 2006<U+2013>2007 season, at the age of 17; he then went on to make 12 appearances in the season. In the 2007<U+2013>2008 season, Vida further solidified his credentials, being featured more regularly for his club.<ref>[http://www.osijek031.com/osijek.php?topic_id=22925 Interview with Domagoj Vida, 03.12.2009.

===Bayer Leverkusen===

However on 29 April 2010, he signed for [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]] in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bayer 04 verpflichtet Domagoj Vida|language=German|date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-04-29|publisher=[[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]]|url=http://www.bayer04.de/B04-DEU//de/_md_aktuell-dt.aspx?aktuell=aktuell-3999&}}</ref>
During his first season with Leverkusen, he mainly played in the [[UEFA Europa League]], making a total of 8 appearances in the competition. He eventually made his [[Fu<U+00DF>ball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]] debut on 5 March 2011 in a 3<U+2013>0 win at home to [[VfL Wolfsburg|Wolfsburg]], coming on as a substitute for the injured [[Manuel Friedrich]] in the 14th minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bender bringt die "W<U+00F6>lfe" aus dem Tritt|language=German|date=2011-03-05|accessdate=2011-03-27|publisher=[[Kicker (sports magazine)|Kicker]]|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2010-11/25/1013455/spielanalyse_bayer-leverkusen-9_vfl-wolfsburg-24.html}}</ref>

===Dinamo Zagreb===
On 14 June 2011, it was announced that Vida will join [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] for an undisclosed fee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/419399/nogomet-1-hnl/dinamo-potvrdio-vidin-dolazak |title=Dinamo potvrdio Vidin dolazak |last=Ga<U+0161>parac |first=Maj |date=16 June 2011 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=Croatian |accessdate=16 June 2011}}</ref> On 25 July 2012, Vida scored a 98th minute goal against [[Bulgaria]]n side [[Ludogorets Razgrad]] in a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match and thus helped his team to a 3:2 home win, which enabled it to progress to the next round.

On 24 September 2012 he was thrown out of the first team and the team bus, after he opened up a beer while the team were on their way to a cup match. He also had several altercations with coach Ante <U+010C>a<U+010D>i<U+0107> before this incident.<ref>http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/ante-cacic-izbacio-vidu-iz-momcadi-/1055943/</ref> The day after it was announced that he would be fined with a record 100,000 euros.<ref>http://www.gnkdinamo.hr/domagoj-vida-kaznjen-sa-100.000-eura.html#anchor</ref>

===Dynamo Kyiv===
On 2 January 2013, it was announced that Vida had signed for [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] on a five-year deal, with a fee of reported <U+20AC>6m.<ref>{{cite news | date= 2 January 2013 | url=http://www.fcdynamo.kiev.ua/news/top/domagoy_vida_nastroen_otobrat_chempionskiy_titul_u_shakhtera/ | script-title=uk:<U+0414><U+043E><U+043C><U+0430><U+0433><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0412><U+0418><U+0414><U+0410>: "<U+041D><U+0430><U+0441><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+0435><U+043D> <U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+0431><U+0440><U+0430><U+0442><U+044C> <U+0447><U+0435><U+043C><U+043F><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0442><U+0438><U+0442><U+0443><U+043B> <U+0443> "<U+0428><U+0430><U+0445><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+0430>"!" | publisher=FC Dynamo Kyiv Official Website| accessdate= 3 January 2013 | language = Ukrainian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=1909855.html|title=Dynamo Kyiv bring in Vida|date=2 January 2013|accessdate=3 January 2013|publisher=UEFA.com}}</ref>

On 14 February, Vida debuted for Dynamo Kyiv in a home [[Europa League]] match against [[Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], which ended a draw 1<U+2013>1. A week later Vida played in second leg and was unable to help Dynamo Kyiv entering the round of 16 with a 0<U+2013>1 loss. In both games Dynamo Kyiv coach [[Oleh Blokhin]] used him as right defender.

On 3 March, Vida played his first game in [[Ukrainian Premier League]] against [[FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih|Kryvbas]]. The home 1-1 draw was again disappointing for Dynamo Kyiv, as it made much more difficult for it to struggle for the second Champions League place against [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist]]. On 10 March, Domagoj Vida played his second match for Dynamo in Ukrainian Premier League against [[FC Volyn Lutsk|Volyn]] on the road, which ended 2-0 and was marked as first Dynamo Kyiv victory in 2013. That match was notable because Oleh Blokhin firstly put Vida on the position of central defender where his partner was [[Yevhen Khacheridi]], while first three games for Dynamo he played as right defender.

On 17 March, Vida scored his first goal for Dynamo Kyiv early in the game against [[FC Vorskla Poltava|Vorskla]] after a corner kick taken by [[Andriy Yarmolenko]], by an excellent header, having forestalled [[Pavlo Rebenok]] and goalkeeper [[Serhiy Dolhanskyi]]. That goal appeared to be winning in minimal Dynamo 1-0 victory.

On 23 May 2010, he made his full international debut in [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]'s 2<U+2013>0 win against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in Osijek, coming on as a substitute for [[Darijo Srna]] in the 80th minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hns-cff.hr/en/matches/105145/hrvatska-wales-20/|title=Croatia - Wales 2:0|date=23 May 2010|publisher=Croatian Football Federation|accessdate=23 May 2010}}</ref> Three days later, he played the full 90 minutes in a goalless draw at [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]]. He was member of Croatia at [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. He started the game from beginning against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. On 10 September 2013, Vida scored his first goal ([[Leon Benko]] provided the assist) for the national side in the 65th minute of a friendly match against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] played on [[Jeonju World Cup Stadium]] in [[Jeonju]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/friendly-south-korea-1-croatia-2|title=Friendly: South Korea 1 Croatia 2|date=10 September 2013|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]]|accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref> He was a part of the Croatian squad at 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament in Brazil.
