The '''Orthodox Christian Education Commission''' is an agency of [[SCOBA]]. It was founded in [[1957]] by a group of Orthodox [[theologians]] and educators as a forum where they could exchange ideas and search for solutions to common educational problems. It currently aims to develop and publish educational materials and offer support services to Orthodox churches in North America.

==Organization==
The OCEC is governed by a board of [[trustees]] made up of jurisdictional representatives. Under the Presidency of [[Metropolitan]] [[Philip (Saliba) of New York|Philip (Saliba)]] of the [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America]], the Commission seeks to encourage cooperation among member [[jurisdiction]]s. The daily operations of the Commission are conducted by an Executive Board, composed of a Chairman (the Vice President of the Commission) and the various heads of the departments.
