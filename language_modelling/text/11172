'''''Backbreaker''''' is an [[American football]] video game developed by [[British people|British]] technology developer [[NaturalMotion]], released on 1 June 2010 in North America and 25 June 2010 in Europe. One of its highlights is the use of the [[Euphoria (software)|Euphoria]] engine; a dynamic physics engine that calculates physical interactions dynamically, rather than depending on canned animations Backbreaker does not use teams from the [[National Football League]], due to the fact that [[Electronic Arts]] has an exclusive license to produce NFL games in its [[Madden (series)|''Madden'' series]]. The game relies on an extensive logo editor and team builder that was called "one of its silver linings". NaturalMotion announced ''Backbreaker'' in August 2007, with a targeted release date of late 2008. However, the game did not end up being released until mid-2010. 

''Backbreaker'' received mixed reviews. While it was praised for the Euphoria animation system, realistic physical gameplay, and the logo editor, it was also criticized for its weak [[online play]], poor passing game, and lack of depth in single-player modes. The Xbox 360 version of the game received an overall rating of 54% from review aggregator [[Metacritic]], while the PlayStation 3 version received a 58%. The iPhone and Android version was given a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars by Touch Arcade.

==Gameplay==
''Backbreaker'' is a simulation-style [[American football]] game, which allows the player to take control of a team of football players and compete against the [[CPU]] or another player in a variety of game modes.<ref name="ign">{{cite web|title=Backbreaker Review|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/109/1094435p1.html|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=IGN|date=2 June 2010}}</ref> The game features 56 built-in teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 88 possible teams.<ref name="ign"/> It lacks any licensing from the [[National Football League]], due to the fact that [[Electronic Arts]] holds the exclusive right to produce games with NFL teams and players.<ref name="psl"/> Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools.<ref name="ign"/>

''Backbreaker'' relies on the [[Euphoria (software)|Euphoria Engine]], a real time physics engine developed by NaturalMotion that has also been used games such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'', and ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=NaturalMotion Euphoria|url=http://naturalmotion.com/euphoria.htm|publisher=NaturalMotion|accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref> This allows for physics animations like tackles and blocking to be created on the spot, instead of using canned animations that may repeat during gameplay.<ref name="ign"/> Due to this, developers pushed to advertise that "no two tackles are the same", in an attempt to draw players to what they called a more physically realistic football game than its competitors.<ref name="ign"/> The physics system was rated well by the reviewers, who commented that the integration of realistic physics created a very life-life like interaction experience between the players on the field.<ref name="psl">{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Joseph|title=PS3 Review <U+2013> Backbreaker|url=http://playstationlifestyle.net/2010/06/01/ps3-review-backbreaker/|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=PlayStation Lifestyle|date=1 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="kotaku" <ref name="kotaku">{{cite news|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Backbreaker Review: The Challenger Crashes|url=http://kotaku.com/5553825/backbreaker-review-the-challenger-crashes|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=Kotaku|date=2 June 2010}}</ref>

Along with the Euphoria Engine, ''Backbreaker'' also features a create-a-team tool and logo creator similar to that of the editor of ''[[Forza Motorsport 2]]''.<ref name="psl"/> Players can create their own team, or modify an existing team.<ref name="gf"/> Players are allowed to take their custom teams online, but are restricted from using the names of existing NFL teams and players.<ref name="stg">{{cite news|last=Accinelli|first=Anthony|title=Developer Interview "Backbreaker Football" Rob Donald of Natural Motion|url=http://www.strengthgamer.com/Dev_Interview_Rob_Donald.html|accessdate=18 July 2010|publisher=Stregnthgamer}}</ref>

===Singleplayer===
''Backbreaker'' features several game modes, some that players can play quickly and others that may be player over a long period of time. In "Training Camp", new players can learn the game's controls and existing ones can practice certain skills and situations.<ref name="psl"/> Different tutorials involving offense, defense, and special teams are in this game mode. This is helpful to players, as the controls in ''Backbreaker'' are different then most current football games.<ref name="psl"/> In "Exhibition Mode", a player can play a single game with custom rules against either another local player or the CPU. Players can use any of the teams in the game, including ones that they have created.<ref name="psl"/>

Another game mode included in ''Backbreaker'' is the mini-game "Tackle Alley". In this game, the player controls a [[running back]] who starts in their own endzone. The player then attempts to score a [[touchdown]] by running up the field and evading a wave of defenders to score points.<ref name="alley">{{cite news|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Only a Few Have Left Tackle Alley 'Alive'|url=http://kotaku.com/5584321/only-a-few-have-left-tackle-alley-alive|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=Kotaku|date=11 July 2010}}</ref> Special moves such as jukes and spins create a "combo chain", which multiply the player's score by an amount depending on how long the combo chain is.<ref name="alley"/> After a player scores, they advance to the next wave of defenders and must repeat the process. If a player is tackled before reaching the endzone, they must start over the wave and lose a "life".<ref name="alley"/> The game ends when all of the player's lives are depleted or the player passes all 100 of the waves, which become harder as the mode progresses.<ref name="alley"/> According to NaturalMotion, only 0.88 percent of all ''Backbreaker'' players have manager to clear all 100 levels of "Tackle Alley".<ref name="alley"/> Game producer Rob Donald states that the mini-game was meant to add an arcade feel to the game. "It was meant to be a complete diversion from the more realistic main game, a complete arcade challenge...Everything about it was meant to replicate the pressure and the frustration of playing a cabinet that you know is stacked against you," said Donald in an interview.<ref name="alley"/>

''Backbreaker'' also features two different season-style modes. The first, "Season Mode", allows a player to create a custom league of either 8, 16, or 32 teams and insert custom-made or default teams into it.<ref name="gf">{{cite news|last=Acevedo|first=Jay|title=Backbreaker|url=http://gamefocus.ca/?nav=reviewCard&fid=7418|accessdate=17 July 2010|newspaper=GameFocus|date=7 June 2010}}</ref> Season mode also features a scouting and drafting system, but lacks trades and free agent signings.<ref name="gf"/> Players can play for several seasons, building a team through scouting college players and drafting them onto their team.<ref name="ign"/> The other season mode included in the game is "Road to Backbreaker".<ref name="ign"/> This mode allows the player to create a custom team and insert it into a league structure similar to the [[English football league system]]'s [[promotion and relegation]].<ref name="ign"/> The player's team begins with a low rating in an 8-team league. By winning games, the player earns credits, which can be used to purchase the contracts of free agents.<ref name="psl"/> By finishing high in the 8-team league, the player's team advances to a 16-team league and eventually a 32-team league. The player improves their team by periodically signing free agents, as the competition is tougher in each league.<ref name="ign"/> The player wins the mode after winning a playoff tournament in the 32-team league.<ref name="psl"/>

=== Multiplayer===
[[File:Screen shot 2010-07-17 at 4.34.10 PM.png|thumb|In-game screenshot of a player playing on defense. ''Backbreaker'' uses an "on the field" camera view much closer to the player than other football video games.]] 
Several game modes in ''Backbreaker'' can also be played with more than one player, whether it be locally or over the [[Internet]]. In Exhibition mode, a second player can join the game and can either play against or on the same team as the first one.<ref name="ign"/> Two players can also play Tackle Alley, competing for the most points.<ref name="gf"/> Games against other players are played in [[Split screen (computer graphics)|splitscreen]] format, contrary to the usual single-camera view of other football game series.<ref name="psl"/> This is due to ''Backbreaker'''s "on the field" camera angle, which is at a high zoom rate and would be impossible to use for a single-camera two player setup.<ref name="ign"/> Although this setup differed from most modern football games, the developers believed it would add realism to the player's experience. "One of the benefits of having this down-on-the-field camera view is that it really makes playing as the quarterback like the passing mechanic feel really natural," said producer Rob Donald.<ref name="joy">{{cite news|last=Yoon|first=Andrew|title=Video dev diary explains Backbreaker's unique camera|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/26/video-dev-diary-explains-backbreakers-unique-camera/|accessdate=18 July 2010|publisher=Joystiq|date=26 March 2010}}</ref>

Players are also able to play games against other players online through the [[PlayStation Network]] and [[Xbox LIVE]] hosting services.<ref name="gf"/> Online, players are able play Quick Games and Tackle Alley, but two players can not play on the same team.<ref name="ign"/> players are allowed to use their custom created teams online, but others are not able to see their created logos unless they are on each other's friends lists.<ref name="gf"/> If not, a generic "Home Team" or "Away Team" logo is displayed in place of the helmet, midfield, and endzone logos.<ref name="gs"/> In addition, an online leaderboard system for ranking players is included.<ref name="ign"/>

== Development ==
[[NaturalMotion]] officially announced ''Backbreaker'' on 22 August 2007 with the release of a short video trailer showcasing some of the aspects of the Euphoria Engine.<ref name="first">{{cite web|last=Magrino|first=Tom|title=Backbreaker kicks off in '08|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/sports/backbreaker/news.html?sid=6177380&mode=news|accessdate=17 July 2010|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=24 August 2010}}</ref> Along with this, a press release from NaturalMotion CEO Torsten Reil stated "By utilizing our motion synthesis engine, euphoria, players will never make the same tackle twice, giving them an intensely unique experience every time they play the game."<ref name="first"/> The targeted release date for the game was late 2008, according to the aforementioned press release.<ref name="first"/> In mid-2008, still without any release date planned, another trailer was released for the game.

Along with this, a third trailer was released showing actual gameplay footage from an Exhibition game.<ref name="gtr"/> Again, no release date was revealed.<ref name="ign"/>

''Backbreaker'' was developed by the British NaturalMotion Games, Ltd. and published by [[505 Games]].<ref name="creds">{{cite web|title=Backbreaker: Credits|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=71063&tab=credits|publisher=[[Allgame]]|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> The game's development heads were Todd Gibbs and Dave Proctor, and the lead producers were Rob Donald and Matt Sherman.<ref name="creds"/> Development began in Summer 2007,<ref name="first"/> and ended in June of 2010.<ref name="gf"/> A game demo was released on 21 May 2010 for [[Xbox LIVE]] gold players and 28 May 2010 for silver players.<ref name="kotaku2">{{cite news|last=Good|first=Owen|title=Backbreaker Demo Hits Xbox Live Tomorrow|url=http://kotaku.com/5544015/backbreaker-demo-hits-xbox-live-tomorrow|accessdate=22 July 2010|publisher=Kotaku|date=20 May 2010}}</ref> When announcing the release date for the [[PlayStation 3]] demo, the developers only commented that it would be released "soon".<ref name="kotaku2"/> However, communication errors with Sony's PlayStation Network caused the demo to be delayed significantly past its Xbox LIVE counterpart, until June 15, 2010, two weeks after the North American release.<ref name="ps3demo">{{cite news|title=Backbreaker Hits the Gridiron on PSN: Demo Now Available|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/109/1097945p1.html|accessdate=22 July 2010|publisher=IGN|date=15 June 2010}}</ref>

NaturalMotion also released a version of BackBreaker for the [[iPhone OS]] and [[Android]] mobile platforms. This version of the game, called ''Backbreaker Football: Tackle Alley'', featured the Tackle Alley minigame found in the full game, sans the Euphoria Engine and with toned-down graphics.<ref name="iphone">{{cite news|last=Hodapp|first=Eli|title='Backbreaker Football: Tackle Alley' Preview with Gameplay Video|url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/09/22/backbreaker-football-tackle-alley-preview-with-gameplay-video/|accessdate=25 July 2010|publisher=TouchArcade|date=22 September 2009}}</ref> The iPhone OS version was released on 29 September 2009,<ref name="iphone"/> while a version for the [[iPad]] named ''BackBreaker HD'' was released on 4 February 2010.<ref name="ipad">{{cite news|last=Jordan|first=Jon|title=NaturalMotion deploys Backbreaker HD for iPad|url=http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPad/Backbreaker+HD/news.asp?c=19602|accessdate=25 July 2010|publisher=[[PocketGamer]]|date=4 February 2010}}</ref> The Android version of the game was released on 5 May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Backbreaker Football|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.ideaworks3d.tackle|publisher=AppBrain|accessdate=25 July 2010}}</ref>

''Backbreaker'' received mixed reviews from critics. While it was praised for its realistic physics, it was also criticized for weak online play, lack of single-player gameplay depth, and poor passing play.<ref name="ign"/><ref name="psl"/><ref name="kotaku"/>  Review aggregator [[Metacritic]] rated the game at 54% for the Xbox 360 version and 58% for the PlayStation 3 version, calling it "a fast-paced, gritty gameplay experience that's more Burnout than Madden,".<ref name="mc360">{{cite web|title=Backbreaker|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/backbreaker?q=backbreaker|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref><ref name="meta" <ref name="meta">{{cite web|title=Backbreaker (PS3)|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Backbreaker_(video_game)&action=submit|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=17 July 2010}}</ref> ''Backbreaker'' also received an aggregate score of 57.31% on [[GameRankings]], based upon 21 different media reviews.<ref name="gamrnk">{{cite web|title=GameRankings: ''Backbreaker''|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox360/942984-backbreaker/index.html|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> The game's [[Euphoria]] physics system was well-liked by reviewers. PlayStation LifeStyle's Joseph Patterson commented that "Realism is a major plus in Backbreaker. Running with the ball feels lifelike and better than any other football game on the market...The fact that the game really tries to make you feel what the player is feeling is probably the game<U+2019>s crowning achievement...literally every tackle is completely different,"<ref name="psl"/> while Jay Acevedo of GameFocus added "...while the game does not scream perfection, it delivers the promise of a realistic and exhilarating experience," in his review.<ref name="gf"/> 

Although developers billed a realistic atmosphere, reviewers criticized that aspect of the game. "I understand the emphisis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort could have been made with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it<U+2019>s completely lacking," said Acevedo in his review.<ref name="gf"/> The game was also criticized for it's lack of play-by-play and poor audio.<ref name="gf"/> "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from <U+201C>[[Boom (P.O.D. song)|Boom]]<U+201D> by [[P.O.D.]] being played during kickoffs (it gets old pretty fast), and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," added Doug Aamoth of Techland.<ref name="techland">{{cite news|last=Aamoth|first=Doug|title=Backbreaker Review: It's No Madden, But Maybe That's Okay|url=http://techland.com/2010/06/10/backbreaker-review-its-no-madden-but-maybe-thats-okay/|accessdate=24 July 2010|publisher=Techland|date=10 June 2010}}</ref>

''Backbreaker'''s close "on the field" camera was also panned by critics. "Because the camera places you right on the field, all of the hits carry even more weight than if you were zoomed farther back, but the positive aspects are overshadowed by an inability to see the entire field," said [[Gamespot]]'s review of ''Backbreaker'', while [[GameZone]] added that "Backbreaker uses a tight third-person view that brings the player closer to the action. The results are visually interesting, but the mechanics are mismanaged. While the game strives to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, the camera often gets in the way."<ref name="gs">{{cite news|title=Backbreaker Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/backbreaker/review.html|accessdate=25 July 2010|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="gamezone">{{cite news|last=Bedigian|first=Louis|title=Backbreaker Review|url=http://www.gamezone.com/reviews/item/backbreaker_review/|accessdate=25 July 2010|publisher=GameZone|date=4 June 2010}}</ref>

''Backbreaker'''s mobile editions fared well, selling over 1.5 million copies of their application.<ref name="ipad"/> The iPhone and Android versions also received positive reviews from critics. "Backbreaker is a fun mini game with cool graphics and animations," said Eli Hodapp in his review of the application. "There isn't anything overly technical about the gameplay, but it has a strangely compelling aspect to it, especially as you're high stepping to the end zone," he added.<ref name="ta">{{cite web|last=Hodapp|first=Eli|title='Backbreaker Football: Tackle Alley' Review|url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/09/22/backbreaker-football-tackle-alley-preview-with-gameplay-video/|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref>
