is an historic English [[cathedral city]], which lies at the heart of the [[City of Canterbury]], a district of [[Kent]] in [[South East England]]. It lies on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]].

Originally a [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] settlement called ''*Durou<U+032F>ernon'' (composed of the [[British language (Celtic)|ancient British]] roots ''*duro-'' "stronghold", ''*u<U+032F>erno-'' "alder tree"), it was renamed ''Durovernum Cantiacorum'' by the Roman conquerors in the 1st century AD. After it became the chief [[Jutes|Jutish]] settlement, it gained its English name Canterbury, itself derived from the [[Old English]] '''Cantwareburh''' ("Kent people's stronghold"). After the [[Kingdom of Kent]]'s [[conversion to Christianity]] in 597, [[St Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] founded an [[episcopal see]] in the city and became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], a position that now heads the [[Church of England]] and the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] (though the modern-day [[Province of Canterbury]] covers the entire south of England). [[Thomas Becket]]'s murder at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in 1170 led to the cathedral becoming a place of pilgrimage for Christians worldwide. This pilgrimage provided the theme for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 14th-century literary classic ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. The literary heritage continued with the birth of the playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]] in the city in the 16th century. 
[[File:Canterbury Cathedral from the cloisters.jpg|thumb|Canterbury Cathedral is one of the most famous religious structures in the world.]]
Parts of the city have been designated a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Many historical structures remain, including a [[Defensive wall|city wall]] founded in [[List of Ancient Rome-related topics|Roman times]] and rebuilt in the 14th century, the ruins of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] and a Norman [[Canterbury Castle|castle]], and perhaps the oldest school in England, [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]]. Modern additions include the [[University of Kent]], [[Canterbury Christ Church University]], the [[University College for the Creative Arts at Canterbury, Epsom, Farnham, Maidstone and Rochester|University College for the Creative Arts]], the [[Marlowe Theatre]], and the [[St Lawrence Ground]], home to [[Kent County Cricket Club]]. The city lies at the heart of the [[City of Canterbury]], a local government district.

Canterbury is a popular tourist destination: consistently one of the most-visited cities in the [[United Kingdom]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/england/kent-and-sussex/canterbury.aspx |title=Canterbury &#124; The Southeast Guide |publisher=Rough Guides |date=1942-06-01 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> the city's economy is heavily reliant upon tourism. There is also a substantial student population, brought about by the presence of three universities. Canterbury is, however, a relatively small city, when compared with other [[British cities]].

=== Early history ===
[[File:Staugustinescanterburyrotundanaveandcathedral.jpg|thumb|St. Augustine's Abbey, which forms part of the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, was where Christianity was brought to England.]]
The Canterbury area has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times. [[Lower Paleolithic]] axes, and [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] pots have been found in the area.<ref>Lyle p. 16.</ref> Canterbury was first recorded as the main settlement of the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe, the [[Cantiaci]], which inhabited most of modern day Kent. In the 1st century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] captured the settlement, and named it [[Durovernum Cantiacorum]], meaning "stronghold of the Cantiaci by the alder grove".<ref>Lyle p. 29.</ref> The Romans rebuilt the city, with new streets in a grid pattern, a theatre, a temple, a forum and [[Public bathing|public baths]]. In the late 3rd century, to defend against attack from [[barbarian]]s, the Romans built around the city an earth bank and a wall with seven gates, which enclosed an area of {{convert|130|acre|ha|0}}.<ref>Lyle p. 43<U+2013>44.</ref>

[[File:Augustine Abbey.jpg|thumb|St. Augustine's Abbey gateway]]

After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Romans left Britain]] in 410&nbsp;AD, Durovernum Cantiacorum was abandoned, apart from a few farmers, and gradually decayed.<ref>Lyle p. 42.</ref> Over the next 100&nbsp;years, an [[Anglo-Saxon]] community formed within the [[Canterbury city walls|city walls]], as [[Jutish]] refugees arrived, possibly intermarrying with the locals.<ref>Lyle p. 42, 47.</ref> The Jutes named the city ''Cantwaraburh'', meaning "Kent people's stronghold".<ref name="c4">{{cite web | title = Canterbury Timeline| publisher=Channel 4| url = http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/T/timeteam/archive/timeteamlive/timeline.html| accessdate =28 May 2008}}</ref> In 597 AD, [[Pope Gregory the Great]] sent [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] to convert King [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent]] to Christianity. After the conversion, Canterbury, as a Roman town, was chosen by Augustine as the centre for an [[episcopal see]] in Kent, and an abbey and cathedral were built. Augustine thus became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Lyle p. 47<U+2013>48.</ref> The town's new importance led to its revival, and trades developed in pottery, textiles and leather. By 630, [[gold coin]]s were being struck at the Canterbury mint.<ref>Lyle p. 48<U+2013>50.</ref> In 672 the [[Synod of Hertford]] gave the see of Canterbury authority over the entire English Church.<ref name="c4"/>

In 842 and 851, Canterbury suffered great loss of life during Danish raids. In 978, Archbishop [[Dunstan]] refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it [[St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury|St Augustine's Abbey]].<ref>Lyle p. 53.</ref> A second wave of Danish attacks began in 991, and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and Archbishop [[Alphege]] was killed. Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist [[William the Conqueror]]'s invasion in 1066.<ref name="c4"/> William immediately ordered a wooden [[motte-and-bailey]] castle to be built by the Roman city wall. In the early 12th century, the [[Canterbury Castle|castle]] was rebuilt with stone.<ref>Lyle p. 64, 66.</ref>

After the murder of Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]] at the cathedral in 1170, Canterbury became one of the most notable towns in Europe, as pilgrims from all parts of Christendom came to visit his shrine.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite web | title =
Descriptive Gazetteer entry for Canterbury | publisher=Vision of Britain| url =http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=842560&word=NULL |  accessdate =28 May 2008}}</ref> This pilgrimage provided the framework for [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s 14th-century collection of stories, ''The Canterbury Tales''.

Canterbury is associated with several saints from this period who lived in Canterbury:
* Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury]]
* Saint [[Anselm of Canterbury]]
* Saint [[Thomas Becket]]
* Saint [[Mellitus]]
* Saint [[Theodore of Tarsus]]
* Saint [[Dunstan]]
* Saint [[Adrian of Canterbury]]

[[File:huguenot canterbury.jpg|right|thumb|[[Huguenot]] weavers' houses near the High Street]]
The [[Black Death]] hit Canterbury in 1348. At 10,000, Canterbury had the 10th largest population in England; by the early 16th century, the population had fallen to 3,000. In 1363, during the [[Hundred Years' War]], a Commission of Inquiry found that disrepair, stone-robbing and ditch-filling had led to the Roman wall becoming eroded. Between 1378 and 1402, the wall was virtually rebuilt, and new wall towers were added.<ref>Lyle, pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref> In 1381, during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the castle and Archbishop's Palace were sacked, and Archbishop [[Simon Sudbury|Sudbury]] was beheaded in London. Sudbury is still remembered annually by the Christmas mayoral procession to his tomb at Canterbury Cathedral. In 1413 [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] became the only sovereign to be buried at the cathedral. In 1448 Canterbury was granted a [[City Charter]], which gave it a mayor and a [[high sheriff]]; the city still has a [[Lord Mayor]] and Sheriff.<ref>Lyle, p. 91.</ref> In 1504 the cathedral's main tower, the Bell Harry Tower, was completed, ending 400&nbsp;years of building.

[[File:Westgate, Canterbury - geograph.org.uk - 983532.jpg|left|thumb|The Westgate is the largest surviving city gate in England. It survived a demolition attempt for a road-widening scheme in Victorian times.]]

During the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the city's [[priory]], [[nunnery]] and three [[friaries]] were closed. St Augustine's Abbey, the 14th richest in England at the time, was surrendered to the Crown, and its church and [[cloister]] were levelled. The rest of the abbey was dismantled over the next 15&nbsp;years, although part of the site was converted to a palace.<ref>Lyle, pp. 97<U+2013>100.</ref> [[Thomas Becket]]'s shrine in the Cathedral was demolished and all the gold, silver and jewels were removed to [[Tower of London|the Tower of London]], and Becket's images, name and feasts were obliterated throughout the kingdom, ending the pilgrimages.

By the 17th century, Canterbury's population was 5,000; of whom 2,000 were [[French language|French-speaking]] Protestant [[Huguenots]], who had begun fleeing persecution and war in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in the mid-16th century. The Huguenots introduced silk weaving into the city, which by 1676 had outstripped wool weaving.<ref name="Lyle">Lyle, p. 107.</ref>

In 1620 [[Robert Cushman]] negotiated the lease of the [[Mayflower]] at 59 Palace Street for the purpose of transporting the [[Pilgrims]] to [[Americas|America]].

In 1647, during the [[English Civil War]], riots broke out when Canterbury's puritan mayor banned [[church service]]s on Christmas Day. The rioters' trial the following year led to a Kent revolt against the Parliamentarian forces, contributing to the start of the [[Second English Civil War|second phase]] of the war. However, Canterbury surrendered peacefully to the Parliamentarians after their victory at the [[Battle of Maidstone]].<ref>Lyle, p. 109.</ref>

Before the end of the war, architect [[Charles Holden]] drew up plans to redevelop the city centre, but locals were so opposed that the Citizens' Defence Association was formed and swept to power in the 1945 municipal elections. Rebuilding of the city centre eventually began 10&nbsp;years after the war.<ref name=Butler14>Butler, p. 14.</ref> A ring road was constructed in stages outside the city walls some time afterwards to alleviate growing traffic problems in the city centre, which was later pedestrianised.

Canterbury, along with Whitstable and Herne Bay, is in the [[City of Canterbury]] [[Districts of England|local government district]]. The city's urban area consists of the six electoral [[Ward (politics)|wards]] of Barton, Harbledown, Northgate, St Stephens, Westgate, and Wincheap. These wards have eleven of the fifty seats on the [[City of Canterbury|Canterbury]] [[City council|City Council]]. Six of these seats are held by the [[Liberal Democrats]], four by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and one by [[Labour party (UK)|Labour]].

The city became a [[county corporate]] in 1461, and later a [[county borough]] under the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. In 1974 it lost its status as the smallest county borough in England, after the [[Local Government Act 1972]], and came under the control of [[Kent County Council]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Canterbury town walls - geograph.org.uk - 1117994.jpg|thumb|[[Canterbury city walls]]]]
Canterbury is located at {{coord|51|16|30|N|1|05|13|E|type:city}} (51.275, 1.087) in east Kent, about {{convert|55|mi|km|0}} east-southeast of London. The coastal towns of [[Herne Bay, Kent|Herne Bay]] and [[Whitstable]] are {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} to the north, and [[Faversham]] is {{convert|8|mi|km|0}} to the northwest. Nearby villages include [[Rough Common]], [[Sturry]] and [[Tyler Hill]]. The civil parish of [[Thanington Without]] is to the southwest; the rest of the city is unparished. [[Harbledown]], [[Wincheap]] and Hales Place are suburbs of the city.

The city is on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour or Great Stour]], flowing from its source at [[Lenham]] north-east through [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] to the [[English Channel]] at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. The river divides south east of the city, one branch flowing though the city, the other around the position of the former walls. The two branches rejoin or are linked several times, but finally recombine around the town of [[Fordwich]], on the edge of the marshland north east of the city. The Stour is navigable on the tidal section to Fordwich, although above this point canoes and other small craft can be used. Punts and rowed river boats are available for hire in Canterbury.
<ref>[http://www.canterburyrivertours.co.uk/ Kent & Canterbury Tourist Attraction | Canterbury Historic River Tours]. Canterburyrivertours.co.uk. Retrieved on 25 August 2011.</ref>
The geology of the area consists mainly of [[brickearth]] overlying chalk. Tertiary sands overlain by [[London clay]] form St. Thomas's Hill and St. Stephen's Hill about a mile northwest of the city centre.<ref>Lyle, p. 15.</ref>

[[File:Canterbury Cathedral - Portal Nave Cross-spire.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Canterbury Cathedral]] is part of a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]]]
[[Canterbury Cathedral]] is the Mother Church of the [[Anglican Communion]] and seat of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Founded in 597&nbsp;AD by [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], it forms a [[World Heritage Site]], along with the Saxon [[St Martin's Church, Canterbury|St. Martin's Church]] and the ruins of [[St Augustine's Abbey]]. With one million visitors per year, it is one of the most visited places in the country. Services are held at the Cathedral three or more times a day.<ref>{{cite web | title = Canterbury Cathedral| publisher=Canterbury Cathedral | url =http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/index.aspx | accessdate =30 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Crumbling cathedral 'needs <U+00A3>50m'|publisher=BBC News | url =http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/index.aspx  | date =3 October 2006| accessdate =30 May 2008}}</ref>

The [[Roman Museum]] houses an ''in situ'' [[mosaic]] pavement dating from around 300 [[Anno Domini|CE]].<ref>[[Sheduled monument]] listing held at [[Kent County Council]]</ref> Surviving structures from the Roman times include Queningate, a blocked gate in the city wall, and the [[Dane John Mound]], once part of a Roman cemetery.<ref>Lyle, p. 142.</ref> The Dane John Gardens were built beside the mound in the 18th century, and a memorial was placed on the mound's summit.<ref>Tellem, p. 37</ref> A [[Mills in Canterbury|windmill]] was on the mound between 1731 and 1839.

The ruins of the Norman [[Canterbury Castle]] and St Augustine's Abbey are both open to the public. The medieval St Margaret's Church now houses the "The Canterbury Tales", in which life-sized character models reconstruct Geoffrey Chaucer's stories. The [[Westgate, Canterbury|Westgate]] is now a museum relating to its history as a jail. The medieval church of [[<U+00C6>lfheah of Canterbury|St Alphege]] became redundant in 1982 but had a new lease of life as the Canterbury Urban Studies Centre, later renamed the Canterbury Environment Centre; the building is used by the [[The King's School, Canterbury|King's School]]. The [[Old Synagogue at Canterbury]], now the King's School Music Room, is one of only two [[Egyptian Revival]] synagogues still standing. The city centre contains many timber-framed 16th- and 17th -century houses, however there are far fewer than there were before [[The Second World War]], as many were damaged during the [[Baedecker Blitz]].

The oldest surviving Tudor theatre in Canterbury is now The Shakespeare,<ref>http://www.shakespearecanterbury.co.uk</ref> formerly known as Casey's. There are several theatre groups based in Canterbury, including the [[University of Kent Students' Union]]'s T24 Drama Society, The Canterbury Players<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.thecanterburyplayers.co.uk/ | title = The Canterbury Players: Canterbury's leading amateur dramatics group}}</ref> and [[Kent Youth Theatre]].

==== The Marlowe Theatre ====
The redeveloped [[Marlowe Theatre]] is (at the time of writing) the largest theatre in the region, offering touring productions and concerts. The programme includes musicals, drama, ballet, contemporary dance, classical orchestras, opera, children's shows, pantomime, stand-up comedy and concerts. There is also a second performance space called The Marlowe Studio, dedicated to creative activity and the programming of new work. 
The Marlowe Theatre can be seen from many points throughout the city centre, considering it is the only modern and tall structure.

=== Music ===

==== The Cathedral ====

===== Medieval =====
[[Polyphony|Polyphonic music]] written for the monks of Christ Church Priory (the Cathedral) survives from the 13th century. The Cathedral may have had an [[Organ (music)|organ]] as early as the 12th century,<ref name="Bowers">Roger Bowers, 'The Liturgy of the Cathedral and its music, c. 1075<U+2013>1642', In: ''A History of Canterbury Cathedral'', ed. P. Collinson, N. Ramsay, M. Sparks. (OUP 1995, revised edition 2002), pp. 408<U+2013>450.</ref> though the names of organists are only recorded from the early 15th century.<ref>[[Canterbury Cathedral#Organs and organists|Canterbury Cathedral : organs and organists]].</ref>
One of the earliest named composers associated with Canterbury Cathedral was [[Leonel Power]], who was appointed master of the new Lady Chapel choir formed in 1438.

===== Post-Reformation =====
The Reformation brought a period of decline in the Cathedral's music which was revived under Dean [[Thomas Neville]] in the early 17th century. Neville introduced instrumentalists into the Cathedral's music who played [[cornett]] and [[sackbut]], probably members of the city's band of waits. The Cathedral acquired sets of [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], [[lute]]s and [[viol]]s for the use of the choir boys and lay-clerks.<ref name="Bowers" />

==== The City ====

===== Early modern =====
As was common in English cities in the Middle Ages, Canterbury employed a town band known as the [[Wait (musician)|Waits]]. There are records of payments to the Waits starting from 1402, though they probably existed earlier than this. The Waits were disbanded by the city authorities in 1641 for 'misdemeanors' but were reinstated in 1660 when they played for the visit of King Charles II on his return from exile.<ref>James M. Gibson, 'The Canterbury Waits', in: ''Records of Early English Drama. Kent: Diocese of Canterbury''. University of Toronto Press and The British Library, 2002.</ref> Waits were eventually abolished nationally by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Municipal Corporations Act of 1835]]. A modern early music group called The Canterbury Waits has revived the name.<ref>[http://themusickcabinet.co.uk/Canterbury_Waits.aspx The Canterbury Waits]. Themusickcabinet.co.uk (30 July 2011). Retrieved on 25 August 2011.</ref>

The Canterbury Catch Club was a musical and social club which met in the city between 1779 and 1865. The club (male only) met weekly in the winter. It employed an orchestra to assist in performances in the first half of the evening. After the interval, the members sang [[Catch (music)|catches]] and [[glees]] from the club's extensive music library (now deposited at the Cathedral Archives in Canterbury).<ref>[http://www.canterbury-cathedral.org/history/libraries.aspx Canterbury Cathedral Library]. Canterbury-cathedral.org. Retrieved on 25 August 2011.</ref>

===== Contemporary =====
The city gave its name to a musical genre known as the Canterbury Sound or [[Canterbury Scene]], a group of [[progressive rock]], [[avant-garde]] and jazz musicians established within the city during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some very notable Canterbury bands were [[Soft Machine]], [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], [[Matching Mole]], [[Egg (band)|Egg]], [[Hatfield and the North]], [[National Health]], [[Gilgamesh (band)|Gilgamesh]], [[Soft Heap]], [[Khan (band)|Khan]], [[Camel (band)|Camel]] and [[In Cahoots]]. Over the years, with band membership changes and new bands evolving, the term has been used to describe a musical style or subgenre, rather than a regional group of musicians.<ref name="Canterbury Scene">{{cite web | title = Canterbury Scene| publisher=Allmusic | url = {{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d10981|pure_url=yes}}|  accessdate =29 May 2008 }}</ref>

=== Railway ===
[[File:Canterbury West railway station building.JPG|thumb|Canterbury West Station. The world's first regular passenger railway ran from this site, and it was here that the world's first season ticket was issued. Today, the station connects with "High Speed 1", on which trains run to London at up to 140 miles-an-hour.]]
Canterbury was the terminus of the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]] (known locally as the Crab and Winkle line) which was a pioneer line, opened on 3 May 1830, and finally closed in 1953. Despite claims by the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], the Canterbury and Whitstable was the first regular passenger steam railway in the world.<ref name="Martin225-231">Graham Martin, ''From Vision to Reality: the Making of the University of Kent at Canterbury'' ([[University of Kent|University of Kent at Canterbury]], 1990) pages 225<U+2013>231 ISBN 0-904938-03-4</ref> The first station in Canterbury was at North Lane.

Today, Canterbury has two [[railway stations]], [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] and [[Canterbury East railway station|Canterbury East]], both operated by [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]], the current franchisee for the railways around Canterbury (which are part of the state-controlled national rail network). Canterbury West station, on the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] from [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], was opened on 6 February 1846, and on 13 April the line to [[Ramsgate]] was completed. Canterbury West is served by high speed (56 minutes) trains to [[London St. Pancras]], slower stopping services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]] and [[Victoria Station (London)|London Victoria]] as well as by trains to [[Ramsgate]] and [[Margate]]. Canterbury East, the more central of the two stations, was opened by the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] on 9 July 1860. Services from [[Victoria Station (London)|London Victoria]] stop at Canterbury East (journey time around 88&nbsp;minutes) and continue to [[Dover]].

Canterbury has previously been served by two other stations. North Lane Station was the southern terminus of the [[Canterbury and Whitstable Railway]] between 1830 and 1846. [[Canterbury South railway station|Canterbury South]] was on the [[Elham Valley Railway]], which opened in 1890 and closed in 1947. A [[High-speed rail|high-speed train]] service to London St Pancras via Ashford International started on 13 December 2009. The journey time to London has been reduced to one hour.<ref>[[Southeastern (train operating company)#High speed services]]</ref>

=== Road ===
[[File:Canterbury Coach stn.JPG|thumb|right|Central Bus station]]
Canterbury is by-passed by the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] London to Dover Road. It is about {{convert|45|mi|km}} from the [[M25 motorway|M25]] London orbital motorway, and {{convert|61|mi|km}} from [[central London]]. The other [[A118 road|main road]] through Canterbury is the [[A28 road|A28]] from [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] to Ramsgate and Margate. The City Council has invested heavily in [[Park and ride|Park-and-Ride]] systems around the City's outskirts and there are three sites: at Wincheap, New Dover Road and Sturry Road. There are plans to build direct access sliproads to and from the London directions of the A2 where it meets the congested Wincheap (at present there are only slips from the A28 to and from the direction of Dover) to allow more direct access to Canterbury from the A2, but these are currently subject to local discussion. In 2011 a third junction was constructed, linking the A28 to the northbound A2; this leaves just the A2 southbound exit missing, but since this would cut across the Park & Ride car park and meet the A28 at an already complicated junction, it is not expected to be added in the near term.<ref name="canterburybyroad">[http://www.canterbury.co.uk/thedms.asp?dms=11&catid=68&easi=true&msg=Browsing$$Travel$Travel$$%20in%20Canterbury How to Get Here]. www.canterbury.co.uk.
