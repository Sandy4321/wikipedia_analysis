The '''McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II'''<ref>The aircraft was originally designated the AH "Super Demon", and later redesignated F4H. The F-4 designation came in [[1961 in aviation|1961]] when the designation systems for all branches of the military were unified by the order of [[Robert McNamara]]. Within McDonnell, the F-4 was referred to as Model 98.</ref> was a two-seat supersonic long-range all-weather fighter-bomber produced for the [[United States]] military by [[McDonnell Douglas]]. Entering service in 1960, the F-4 was designed as the first modern fleet defense fighter for the [[United States Navy]]. By 1963, it was adopted by the [[United States Air Force]] for the fighter-bomber role. When production ended in 1981, 5,195 Phantom IIs had been built, making it the most numerous American supersonic military aircraft. Until the advent of the [[F-15 Eagle]], the F-4 also held a record for the longest continuous production with a run of 24 years. Innovations in the F-4 included an advanced [[pulse-doppler radar]] and extensive use of [[titanium]] in the airframe.

Despite the imposing dimensions and a maximum takeoff weight of over 60,000&nbsp;pounds (27,000&nbsp;kg), the F-4 was capable of reaching a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach&nbsp;2.23]] and had an initial climb rate of over 41,000&nbsp;feet per minute (210&nbsp;m/s). Shortly after its introduction, the Phantom set 16 world records, including an absolute speed record of 1,606.342&nbsp;miles per hour (2,585.086&nbsp;km/h), and an absolute altitude record of 98,557&nbsp;feet (30,040&nbsp;m). Although set in 1959-1962, five of the speed records were not broken until 1975.

The F-4 could carry up to 18,650&nbsp;pounds (8,480&nbsp;kg) of weapons on nine external hardpoints, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles, and unguided, guided, and nuclear bombs. Created when air-to-air missiles were expected to eliminate the need for close air combat, the Phantom received an internal cannon only in the definitive F-4E variant.

Due to its widespread service with United States military and its allies and distinctive appearance, the F-4 is one of the best-known icons of the [[Cold War]]. It served with distinction in [[Vietnam War]] and [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]s, with F-4 crews achieving 393 aerial victories and completing countless ground attack sorties. It was also a capable tactical reconnaissance and [[Wild Weasel]] ([[SEAD|supression of enemy air defenses]]) platform, seeing action as late as the [[Gulf War]]. The Phantom was also the only aircraft used by both the [[U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds]] (F-4E) and the U.S. Navy [[Blue Angels]] (F-4J) flight demonstration teams. In addition to the three branches of the United States military, the Phantom served with the armed forces of eleven other nations. Although retired from USAF active duty in 1996, over a thousand Phantoms were still in worldwide service [[2001|as of 2001]].

==Development==
The origins of [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]]'s F-4 can be traced to a [[1953 in aviation|1953]] request by the Navy for an upgrade of [[F3H Demon|McDonnell F3H Demon]] carrier-borne fighter. Although the Vought [[F-8 Crusader|F8U Crusader]] won the contract, the Super Demon (as McDonnell's entrant was dubbed) was developed as a ground attack aircraft under the designation AH, which by [[1955 in aviation|1955]] had evolved into an all-weather air superiority fighter designated F4H. The F4H first flew in [[1958 in aviation|1958]] and remained in production from [[1959 in aviation|1959]] until [[1981 in aviation|1981]]. [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]] was the chief of preliminary design, and ultimately, the Program Manager for the development and sales effort.

===Super Demon===
In [[1953 in aviation|1953]], McDonnell Aircraft began work on modernizing its [[F3H Demon]] naval fighter. Seeking expanded capabilities and better performance, the company developed several projects including the '''F3H-E''' with a Wright J67 engine, the '''F3H-G''' with two [[Wright J65]] engines, and the '''F3H-H''' with two [[General Electric J79]] engines. The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number|Mach&nbsp;1.97]]. On [[19 September]] [[1953]], McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the "Super Demon". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular&mdash;it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;millimeter cannon, or 56 [[Fin-Folding Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the 9 [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mockup of the F3H-G/H but felt that the upcoming [[F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for the supersonic fighter. The McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on [[18 October]] [[1954]] the company received a letter of intent for two '''YAH-1''' prototypes. On [[26 May]] [[1955]], four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and within an hour presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. The addition of powerful radar capabilities necessitated a second crewman. In a fateful decision, the aircraft was to be armed only with missiles.

===Phantom origins===
In 1952, [[McDonnell Aircraft|McDonnell]]'s Chief of Aerodynamics, [[David S. Lewis, Jr.|Dave Lewis]] was appointed by CEO [[James S. McDonnell|J.S. McDonnell]] to be the company's Preliminary Design Manager. The first of its kind in the aerospace industry, the group had no specific target other than  to learn and  understand all of the rapid technical advances being made in aeronautics, airframes, and engines.

With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded that the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type, an Attack Fighter. At the time, the Navy had separate Fighter and Attack branches, each with separate systems and operational requirements. After many iterations and various "enemy capability" assumptions, an "unwanted" Attack Fighter was presented to the Navy. The McDonnell design called for two engines. The primary air-to-air armament was provided by the new [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sparrow III missiles]] semi-submerged in the fuselage. The air-to-ground armament was to be as many bombs as could be carried on stations that would be mounted under the wings and aft of the Sparrow stations on the fuselage. No guns were offered. It took two long years of hard work with the Bureau of Aeronautics and the Naval Air Warfare Division in the Pentagon, but the F-4 was sold with pretty much the same configuration as was originally proposed. <ref name="Lewis 1993">{{cite book | author=[[David S.

===XF4H-1 prototype===
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:F4H.jpg|right|thumb|250px|F4H-1 Prototype. Note a different inlet geometry, smaller radome, and a small rear cockpit canopy.]] -->
The '''XF4H-1''' was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles and be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45&nbsp;degrees and was equipped with a [[boundary layer control system]] for better low-speed handling. [[Wind tunnel]] testing revealed lateral instability requiring the addition of 5&nbsp;degrees [[dihedral]] to the wings. To avoid redesigning the [[titanium]] central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12&nbsp;degrees which averaged to the required 5&nbsp;degrees over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive "dogtooth" for improved control at high [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23&nbsp;degrees of [[anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack and clear the engine exhaust. In addition, air intakes were equipped with movable ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, landing gear was designed for landings with a sink rate of 23&nbsp;feet per second (7&nbsp;m/s). The nose strut could extend by some 20&nbsp;inches (50&nbsp;cm) to increase angle of attack at takeoff. <ref name="Donald 2002">{{cite book| last= Donald | first= D | coauthors= Lake, J| year=2002| title= McDonnell F-4 Phantom: Spirit in the Skies| publisher= AIRtime Publishing| id= ISBN 1880588315}}</ref>

===Naming the aircraft===
The F4H was initially going to be named "Satan" or "[[Mithras]]". Under pressure from the government, the aircraft was given the less controversial name "Phantom II", the first "Phantom" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[FH-1 Phantom|FH-1]]. Since the FH-1 was long out of service, the new aircraft was usually referred to simply as the "Phantom".

===Flight testing===
On [[25 July]] [[1955]], the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five '''YF4H-1''' pre-production fighters. The Phantom made its maiden flight on [[27 May]] [[1958]] with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of landing gear but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the addition of distinctive 12,500 bleed air holes on each ramp, and the aircraft soon squared off against the [[F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. The Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on [[17 December]] [[1958]] the F4H was declared a winner. Due to delays with the J79-GE-8 engines, the first production aircraft had the J79-GE-2 and -2A engines with 16,100&nbsp;pound-force (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier trials with the first complete launch-recovery cycle performed on [[15 February]] [[1960]] from [[USS Independence (CV-62)]].

===Into production===
Early in production, the radar was upgraded to a larger AN/APQ-72, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic. The changes did little to improve the Phantom's appearance, with one critic saying it looked like someone stepped on its nose and kicked it in the butt. Overall, the Phantom underwent a great many changes during its career, summarized in the "Variants" section below.

The [[United States Air Force]] received Phantoms as the result of [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the military. After an F-4B won the '''Operation Highspeed''' fly-off against the [[F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them '''F-110A Spectre''', and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the Navy focus on air superiority, the USAF emphasized a fighter-bomber role. With unification of designations in 1962, the Phantom became the '''F-4''' with the Naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C. The first Air Force Phantom flew on [[27 May]] [[1963]], exceeding Mach&nbsp;2 on its maiden flight.

Phantom II production ended in the United States in [[1979 in aviation|1979]] after 5,195 had been built (5,057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi), making it the second most numerous American jet after the [[F-86 Sabre]]. Of these, 2,874 went to the USAF, 1,264 to the Navy and Marine Corps, and the rest to foreign customers.<ref name="Boeing">{{cite web|title=F-4 Phantoms Phabulous 40th|url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/|accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref> The last US-built F-4 went to Turkey, while the last F-4 ever built was completed in [[1981 in aviation|1981]] as an F-4EJ by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] in Japan. [[2001|As of 2001]], about 1,100 Phantoms remained in service worldwide, including QF-4 drones operated by the US military.<ref name="Green 2001">{{cite book | last=Green | first=W | coauthors=Swanborough, G | year=2001 | title=The Great Book of Fighters | edition= | publisher=MBI Publishing | location= | id=ISBN 0760311943 }}</ref>

===World record breaker===
To show off their new fighter, the Navy led a series of record-breaking flights early in Phantom development.<ref name="Boeing"/>

*Operation Top Flight: On [[6 December]] [[1959]], the second XF4H-1 performed a zoom climb to a world record 98,557&nbsp;feet (30,040&nbsp;m). The previous record of 94,658&nbsp;feet (28,852&nbsp;m) was set by a Soviet [[Sukhoi Su-9|Sukhoi T-43-1]] prototype. Commander Lawrence E. Flint Jr. accelerated his aircraft to Mach&nbsp;2.5 at 47,000&nbsp;feet (14,330&nbsp;m) and climbed to 90,000&nbsp;feet (27,430&nbsp;m) at a 45 degree angle. He then shut down the engines and glided to the peak altitude. As the aircraft fell through 70,000&nbsp;feet (21,300&nbsp;m), Flint restarted the engines and resumed normal flight.
* On [[5 September]] [[1960]], an F4H-1 averaged 1,216.78&nbsp;miles per hour (1,958.16&nbsp;km/h) over a 500&nbsp;kilometer (311&nbsp;mi) closed-circuit course.
* On [[25 September]] [[1960]], an F4H-1 averaged 1,390.21&nbsp;miles per hour (2,237.26&nbsp;km/h) over a 100&nbsp;kilometer (62&nbsp;mi) closed-circuit course.
* Operation LANA: To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Naval aviation (L is the [[Roman numeral]] for 50 and ANA stood for Anniversary of Naval Aviation) on [[24 May]] [[1961]], Phantoms flew across the continental United States in under three hours in spite of several tanker refuelings. The fastest of the aircraft averaged 869.74&nbsp;miles per hour (1,400.28&nbsp;km/h) and completed the trip in 2 hours 47 minutes, earning the pilot Lt. Richard Gordon and navigator Lt. Bobbie Long the 1961 [[Bendix trophy]]. 
* Operation Sageburner: On [[28 August]] [[1961]], a Phantom averaged 902.769&nbsp;miles per hour (1,452.826&nbsp;km/h) over a 3-mile (1.86 km) course flying below 125&nbsp;feet (40&nbsp;m) at all times. Navy Commander J.L. Felsman was killed during the first attempt at this record on [[18 May]] [[1961]] when his aircraft disintegrated in the air after pitch dampener failure.
* Operation Skyburner: On [[22 December]] [[1961]], a modified Phantom with water-methanol injection set an absolute world record speed of 1,606.342&nbsp;miles per hour (2,585.086&nbsp;km/h).
* On [[5 December]] [[1961]], another Phantom set a sustained altitude record of 66,443.8&nbsp;feet (20,252.1&nbsp;m).
* Operation High Jump: A series of time-to-altitude records was set in early [[1962 in aviation|1962]]; 34.523&nbsp;seconds to 3,000&nbsp;meters (9,840&nbsp;ft), 48.787&nbsp;seconds to 6,000&nbsp;meters (19,680&nbsp;ft), 61.629&nbsp;seconds to 9,000&nbsp;meters (29,530&nbsp;ft), 77.156&nbsp;seconds to 12,000&nbsp;meters (39,370&nbsp;ft), 114.548&nbsp;seconds to 15,000&nbsp;meters (49,210&nbsp;ft), 178.5&nbsp;seconds to 20,000&nbsp;meters (65,600&nbsp;ft), 230.44&nbsp;seconds to 25,000&nbsp;meters (82,000&nbsp;ft), and 371.43&nbsp;seconds to 30,000&nbsp;meters (98,400&nbsp;ft). Although not officially recognized, the Phantom zoom-climbed to over 100,000&nbsp;feet (30,480&nbsp;m) during the last attempt.

All in all, the Phantom set 16 world records. With the exception of Skyburner, all records were achieved in unmodified production aircraft. Five of the speed records remained unbeaten until the [[F-15 Eagle]] appeared in 1975.

==Operational history==
===United States Navy===
[[Image:F4Phantom.JPG|thumb|right|250px|US Marine F-4S]]

On [[30 December]] [[1960]], the [[VF-121]] Pacemakers became the first Phantom operator with its F4H-1Fs (F-4As). The [[VF-74]] Be-devilers at [[NAS Oceana]] became the first deployable Phantom squadron when it received its F4H-1s (F-4Bs) on [[8 July]] [[1961]]. The squadron completed carrier qualifications in October 1961 and Phantom's first full carrier deployment between August 1962 and March 1963 aboard [[USS Forrestal (CVA-59)]]. The second deployable [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] squadron to receive F-4Bs was the [[VF-102]] Diamondbacks who promptly took their new aircraft on the [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown cruise]] of the [[USS Enterprise (CVAN-65)]]. The first deployable [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] squadron to receive the F-4B was the [[VF-114]] Aardvarks which participated in the September 1962 cruise aboard [[USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63)]].

By the time of the [[Tonkin Gulf incident]], 13 of 31 deployable Navy squadrons were armed with the type. F-4Bs from [[USS Constellation (CV-64)]] made the first Phantom combat sortie of the [[Vietnam War]] on [[5 August]] [[1964]], flying bomber escort in [[Operation Pierce Arrow]]. The first Phantom air-to-air victory of the war took place on [[9 April]] [[1965]] when an F-4B from [[VF-96]] Fighting Falcons piloted by Lt JG Terence M. Murphy shot down a Chinese [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17]]. The Phantom was then shot down, apparently by an AIM-7 Sparrow from one of its wingmen.<ref name="Donald 2002"/> On [[17 June]] [[1965]], an F-4B from [[VF-21]] Freelancers piloted by Cdr Thomas C. Page and Lt John C. Smith shot down the first North Vietnamese MiG of the war. 

On [[10 May]] [[1972]], [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]] and [[William P. Driscoll]] flying an F-4J called "Showtime 100" shot down three MiGs to become the first [[flying ace]]s of the war. Their fifth victory is believed to be over the mysterious North Vietnamese ace [[Nguyen Toon|Colonel Toon]]. On the return flight, the Phantom was damaged by an enemy [[surface-to-air missile]]. To avoid being captured, Cunningham and Driscoll flew upside-down (the damage made the aircraft uncontrollable in a conventional attitude) and on fire until they could eject over water. During the war, Navy Phantom squadrons participated in 84 combat tours with F-4Bs, F-4Gs, and F-4Js. The Navy claimed 41 air-to-air victories at the cost of 71 aircraft lost to enemy fire (5 to aircraft, 13 to [[surface-to-air missile|SAMs]], and 53 to [[anti-aircraft warfare|AAA]]). An additional 54 aircraft were lost in accidents.

By 1983, the F-4Ns have been completely replaced by [[F-14 Tomcat]]s, and by 1986 the last F-4Ss were exchanged for [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s. On [[25 March]] [[1986]], an F-4S belonging to [[VF-161]] Chargers became the last Navy Phantom to launch from an aircraft carrier ([[USS Midway (CV-41)]]). On [[18 October]] [[1986]], an F-4S from [[VF-202]] Superheats made the last-ever Phantom carrier landing aboard [[USS America (CV-66)]]. In 1987, the last of the Naval Reserve-operated F-4Ss were replaced by F-14s. The only Phantoms still in service with the Navy are the QF-4 target drones operated by the [[Pacific Missile Test Center|Naval Air Warfare Center]]s.<ref name="Donald 2002"/>

===United States Marine Corps===
The Marines received their first F-4Bs in June 1962, with the [[VMFA-314]] Black Knights becoming the first operational squadron. In addition to attack variants, the Marines also operated several tactical reconnaissance RF-4Bs. Marine Phantoms from [[VMFA-531]] Gray Ghosts arrived in Vietnam on [[10 April]] [[1965]], flying close air support missions from land bases as well as from [[USS America (CVA-66)]]. The Marines claimed 3 enemy MiGs at the cost of 75 aircraft lost in combat, mostly to ground fire, and 4 in accidents. On [[18 January]] [[1992]], the last Marine Phantom, an F-4S, was retired by [[VMFA-112]] Cowboys. The squadron was re-equipped with F/A-18 Hornets.

===United States Air Force===
At first reluctant to adopt a Navy fighter, the USAF quickly embraced the design and became the largest Phantom user. The first Air Force Phantoms in Vietnam were F-4Cs from [[555th Fighter Squadron|555th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] Triple Nickel which arrived in December 1964. Unlike the Navy, the Air Force initially flew its Phantoms with a pilot rather than a radar intercept officer (RIO), later called [[weapon systems officer]] (WSO), in the back seat and all aircraft retained dual flight controls. USAF F-4Cs scored their first victory against a Vietnamese MiG-17 on [[10 July]] [[1965]] using [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] air-to-air missiles. On [[24 July]] [[1965]], an Air Force F-4C from the [[47th Fighter Squadron|47th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] became the first American plane to be downed by an enemy [[surface-to-air missile|SAM]], and 54 F-4Cs were lost in combat by 1966. Early aircraft suffered from leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft were found to have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers.<ref name="knaack"/> There were also problems with [[aileron]] control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires.

Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on [[30 October]] [[1965]], flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. Although the F-4C, being essentially identical to the Navy F-4B, carried the Navy-designed Sidewinder missiles, the USAF-tailored F-4Ds initially arrived with [[AIM-4 Falcon]]s. However, the Falcon was designed to shoot down slow bombers and proved virtually useless in combat against agile fighters, and F-4Ds quickly reverted to using Sidewinders under the '''Rivet Haste''' program. Like other Vietnam War Phantoms, the F-4Ds were urgently fitted with radar homing and warning (RHAW) antennae to detect the Soviet-built [[SA-2 Guideline]] SAMs. The attrition resulted in a shortage of [[F-105 Thunderchief]] fighter-bombers and USAF pressed the Phantoms into the hazardous ground attack role. As the result, by 1972 the F-4 was second only to the F-105 in combat losses with 362 downed aircraft. On [[28 August]] [[1972]], [[Richard S. Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] became the first USAF ace of the war. On [[9 September]] [[1972]], WSO [[Charles B. DeBellevue]] became the highest-scoring American ace of the war with six victories. WSO Jeffrey Feinstein became the last USAF ace of the war on [[13 October]] [[1972]]. 

[[Image:F-4 Phantom in flight Apr 1982.jpg|thumb|250px|"Wild Weasel" F-4G with an [[AGM-88 HARM]] missile under the wing]]
On [[31 January]] [[1972]], the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron/183d Tactical Fighter Group of [[Illinois Air National Guard]] became the first [[Air National Guard]] unit to transition to Phantoms. The ANG service lasted until [[31 March]] [[1990]], when the Phantom was replaced by the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]. Then, on [[15 August]] [[1990]], 24 F-4G [[Wild Weasel]] Vs and 6 RF-4Cs were mobilized to the Middle East for [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. The reason for this was that the F-4G was the only aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the [[SEAD|suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)]] role since the [[General Dynamics F-111|EF-111 Raven]] lacked the offensive capability of [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G Wild Weasel Vs from [[561st Fighter Squadron]], were retired on [[26 March]] [[1996]]. The last operational flight of the F-4G Wild Weasel was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996.  The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj. Mike Webb and Maj. Gary Leeder, Idaho ANG.  Like the Navy, the Air Force continues to operate QF-4 target drones. In addition, the Collings Foundation operates a restored F-4D [[warbird]] which performs at airshows.<ref name="Donald 2002"/>

===Flying the Phantom===
In air combat, the Phantom's greatest advantage was its thrust which permitted a skilled pilot to engage and disengage from the fight at will. Not surprisingly, the massive aircraft which was designed to fire radar-guided missiles from [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond visual range]] lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents. Although the F-4 proved somewhat liable to enter spins during high-G and high angle of attack maneuvers, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly on the edge of its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge [[slats]] on the wing, greatly enhancing high [[angle of attack]] maneuverability at the expense of top speed. The J79 engines produced copious amounts of black smoke at military power which made the Phantoms easy to detect and visually track from a distance. Pilots would often turn on their afterburners to eliminate the contrails, but at the cost of fuel efficiency. By far, the biggest weakness of the F-4 was its lack of cannon armament. The American military doctrine at the time dictated that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and no effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly degraded the speed to subsonic values and the early missiles were inaccurate and unreliable. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks and many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire the short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. It did not take long for USAF F-4Cs to begin carrying SUU-16 or SUU-23 external gunpods containing a 20 millimeter [[M61 Vulcan]] gatling cannon, with some Marine aircraft carrying two pods for ground strafing. Combat trials demonstrated that while the externally mounted cannon was inaccurate, the cost of ammunition expended per destroyed enemy aircraft was a small fraction of the missiles'. The lack of cannon was definitively addressed with the F-4E.<ref name="Higham 1978">{{cite book| last= Higham | first= R | coauthors= Williams, C| year= 1978| title= Flying Combat Aircraft of USAAF-USAF (Vol.2)| publisher= Air Force Historical Foundation| id= ISBN 0813803756}}</ref>

The Phantom served with the air forces of many countries, including [[Australia]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]], [[South Korea]] and [[Turkey]]. 

;<big>Australia</big>
In 1963, McDonnell offered the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] an F-4C re-engined with [[SNECMA Atar]] 9 turbojets used in the RAAF's [[Dassault Mirage III|Dassault Mirage IIIO]] fighters. Although the RAAF opted for the [[General Dynamics F-111]]C instead, production delays forced them to lease 24 USAF F-4Es from 1970 to 1973. The Phantoms were so well-liked that the RAAF actually considered adopting the F-4E. However, acquisition of the Phantom would have required disbanding at least one [[Dassault Mirage III]] squadron in order to provide the necessary aircrew ([[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 Wing's]] aircrew were to be converted to the F-111). One F-4E was lost in an accident during Australian service off [[Evans Head, New South Wales]].<ref name="Baugher"/>

;<big>Egypt</big>
Although the [[Egyptian Air Force]] was initially interested in the [[F-5 Tiger]], in 1979 they purchased 35 former USAF F-4Es along with a number of Sparrow, Sidewinder, and Maverick missiles for US$594 million as part of the '''Peace Pharaoh''' program. The Egyptians were used to the simpler Soviet [[Mikoyan|MiG]] fighters and found the Phantom to be a maintenance nightmare, with only 9 aircraft remaining in flying condition during the early 1980s.<ref name="Baugher"/> A rigorous training program solved most of the difficulties by 1985. An additional 8 surplus USAF aircraft were purchased in 1988, along with three replacements for crashed aircraft. 

;<big>Germany</big>
The German [[Luftwaffe]] initially ordered the reconnaissance RF-4E in 1969. One of these aircraft was fitted with [[ELINT]] equipment and flew under the '''Peace Trout''' program. In 1982, the initially unarmed RF-4Es were given a secondary ground attack capability through modifications by [[Messerschmitt|Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm]]. The Luftwaffe RF-4Es were retired in 1994.

To fill the gap between the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and the [[Panavia Tornado]], in 1973 the Luftwaffe purchased the lightened and simplified F-4F with a smaller radar and no aerial refueling or AIM-7 Sparrow capabilities under the '''Peace Rhine''' program. In 1983, Germany initiated the '''ICE''' (Improved Combat Efficiency, German name '''KWS''' - Kampfwertsteigerung) program which outfitted the F-4Fs with the same [[AN/APG-65]] radar as in the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], and added the ability to fire [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] missiles, digital avionics, and smokeless engines. The ICE-upgraded F-4Fs began entering service in 1992.<ref name="Green 2001"/> It is worth noting that 24 F-4Fs were operated by the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing of the USAF at [[Holloman AFB]] to train Luftwaffe crews. The ICE F-4Fs are expected to remain in service until full implementation of the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]].

;<big>Greece</big>
In 1971, the [[Hellenic Air Force]] purchased F-4E and RF-4E Phantoms, which were supplemented by surplus RF-4Es and F-4Es from Luftwaffe and US ANG in the early 1990s. Several of the aircraft were modified to the F-4G Wild Weasel V standard and fitted with [[AGM-88 HARM]] anti-radiation missiles. Following the success of the German ICE program, on [[11 August]] [[1997]], [[DASA]] of Germany received a contract to upgrade 39 aircraft to the very similar '''Peace Icarus 2000''' standard. The upgrade included an [[AN/APG-65]]GY radar, [[Honeywell]] H-764G navigation system which is a combination of laser [[inertial navigation system]] (LINS), [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), and [[Elbit Systems]] Modular Multi-Role Computer (MMRC), the [[LITENING targeting pod]], and the ability to launch the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] air-to-air missiles and the [[AGM-130]] stand-off weapon.<ref name="Donald 2002"/>

;<big>Iran</big>
In the 1960s and 1970s, then US-friendly Iran purchased 225 F-4D, F-4E and RF-4E Phantoms. Like the [[F-14 Tomcat]], many of the Iranian F-4s have since fallen to attrition and lack of spare parts. The surviving aircraft are believed to have benefitted from clandestine shipments of spares from Israel and the United States (during the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]), as well as from locally-designed and reverse-engineered components and weapons, and incorporation of ex-Soviet and Chinese technology.<ref name="Green 2001"/>

;<big>Israel</big>
The [[Israeli Air Force]] has been the largest foreign user of the Phantom, flying both newly built and ex-USAF aircraft, as well as several one-off special reconnaissance variants. The first F-4Es, nicknamed '''Kurnass''' (Heavy hammer), and RF-4Es, nicknamed '''Oref''' (Raven), were delivered in 1969 under the '''Peace Echo I''' program. Additional Phantoms arrived during the 1970s under '''Peace Echo II''' through '''Peace Echo V''' and '''Nickel Grass''' programs. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat during [[Arab-Israeli conflict]]s, first seeing action during the [[War of Attrition]]. The first Kurnass air-to-air victory came on [[1969-11-11]] against an Egyptian [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]. The first air combat loss, also to a MiG-21, happened on [[1970-04-02]]. Over the course of the conflicts, IDF claimed 116 air victories to 56 losses, mostly to ground fire.<ref name="Baugher"/>

Israeli F-4s underwent an extensive modification program to adapt them for local weapons and avionics. In the 1980s, Israel began the '''Kurnass 2000''' modernization program which significantly updated avionics, including the APG-76 radar and cockpit with [[multi-function display]]s and [[HOTAS]], and added the ability to launch the [[AGM-142 Have Nap|Popeye]] missiles. Kurnass 2000 aircraft, which first flew on [[11 August]] [[1987]] and began entering service on [[5 February]] [[1991]], can be recognized by small strakes above the air intakes and a "probe-and-drogue" refueling probe plumbed directly into the boom receptacle on the spine of the aircraft. Israel also created a [[Pratt & Whitney PW1120]]-engined version which first flew on [[30 July]] [[1986]]. The aircraft was capable of [[supercruise]], had 17&nbsp;percent better thrust-to-weight ratio, 15&nbsp;percent better sustained turn rate, 36&nbsp;percent greater climb rate, and 27&nbsp;percent better acceleration, all with improved fuel efficiency. It was demonstrated at the 1987 [[Paris Air Show]] but the project was deemed too expensive for the aging airframes.<ref name="Donald 2002"/> The last Israeli F-4s were retired [[12 May]] [[2004]].

;<big>Japan</big>
[[Image:F-4 1 Yokota Tokyo.jpg|thumb|250px|JASDF RF-4EJ]]
In 1968, the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] purchased 140 simplified F-4EJ Phantoms without the ground attack capability, 138 of which were built under license in Japan by Mitsubishi, along with 14 unarmed reconnaissance RF-4EJs. Of these, 96 F-4EJs have since been modified to the '''F-4EJ Kai''' standard with laser [[inertial navigation system]], APG-66J radar, and other avionics upgrades. Eleven reconnaissance aircraft received a similar '''RF-4EJ Kai''' upgrade. 

;<big>South Korea</big>
The [[Republic of Korea Air Force]] purchased its first batch of ex-USAF F-4D Phantoms in 1968 under the '''Peace Spectator''' program. The ex-USAF F-4Ds continued to be delivered until 1988. The '''Peace Pheasant II''' program also provided newly-built and ex-USAF F-4Es. In 1993, RoKAF evaluated an upgrade program for 38 F-4Es but settled on the less costly service life extension upgrades and the addition of [[Pave Tack]] electro-optical targeting pods and [[AGM-142 Have Nap]] missiles.

;<big>Spain</big>
The [[Spanish Air Force]] acquired its first batch of ex-USAF F-4C Phantoms in 1971 under the '''Peace Alfa''' program. Designated '''C.12''', the aircraft were retired in 1989. At the same time, the SAF received a number of ex-USAF RF-4Cs, designated '''RC.12'''. In 1995-1996, these aircraft received extensive avionics upgrades, including the APQ-172 radar and the ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation system.

;<big>Turkey</big>
The [[Turkish Air Force]] received its first Phantoms in 1974 under the '''Peace Diamond III''' program, followed by ex-USAF aircraft in '''Peace Diamond IV'''. In 1995, the IAI of Israel implemented an upgrade similar to Kurnass 2000 on 54 Turkish F-4Es. Dubbed '''Terminator 2020''', the aircraft are optimised for ground attack and unable to fire the AIM-120 AMRAAM. The upgrade includes an advanced ELTA SPS-100 [[fire-control system]]/[[radar]] adopted from the abortive [[IAI Lavi]] technology demonstrator of the early 1990s.<ref name="Donald 2002"/>

;<big>United Kingdom</big>
The [[United Kingdom]] bought the F-4 for use with the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] in the wake of the cancellation of home-grown projects such as the [[BAC TSR-2]] and the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154]]. British versions were based on the USN F-4J and were given the designation F-4K and F-4M respectively. They entered service as the FG.1 and FGR.2, replacing the [[Hawker Hunter]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. British Phantoms were fitted with the larger and more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] [[turbofan]] engines with 20,515&nbsp;pound-force (91.25&nbsp;kN) of afterburning thrust each for improved take-off performance, and many of the subsystems were replaced with British-manufactured equivalents. The larger engines required more air which necessitated 20&nbsp;percent larger air intakes and compromised top speed and high altitude performance. Range improved, however, due to the turbofans' better fuel efficiency. The Fleet Air Arm Phantoms were fitted with a double-telescoping front landing gear strut which could extend 40&nbsp;inches (102&nbsp;cm), the increased [[angle of attack]] being necessary for catapult launches from the smaller British carrier [[HMS Ark Royal (R09)]]. The first British-spec YF-4K flew on [[27 June]] [[1966]], with YF-4M joining it on [[17 February]] [[1967]]. After the [[Falklands War]], British-spec Phantoms were joined by 15 former US Navy F-4J(UK) upgraded to the F-4K/M standard to compensate for one interceptor squadron that was moved to the islands.<ref name="Green 2001"/>

The Fleet Air Arm order was cut down with the cutting back of the [[Royal Navy]] carrier force. As the result, the majority of the 160 British Phantoms flew with the RAF in ground attack and long range interception roles. In the late 1970s, RAF Phantoms were replaced by the [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] for ground attack roles and the FAA Phantoms were given over to the RAF. The interceptor Phantoms were replaced by the [[Panavia Tornado]] F3. The last British Phantoms were retired in [[1993 in aviation|1993]] as a result of the [[Options for Change]] spending cuts.<ref name="Donald 2002"/>

==Phantom nicknames==
[[image:F-4 parts distribution.jpg|right|100px]]
The Phantom gathered a number of nicknames during its career. It was the "Rhino" because of the long nose and tough [[titanium]] construction, the "Double Ugly" and "DUFF" (Double-Ugly Flying Fucker) in reference to its [[dihedral]] wings and [[anhedral]] tail as well as a joke on its two crew members, the "World's Leading Distributor of MiG Parts" in tribute to its claimed record of downing 277 [[Mikoyan|Soviet-built MiGs]] in US service and additional 116 with Israel, the "Flying Anvil", the "Big Iron Sled", and the "Louisville Slugger." As a reflection of excellent performance in spite of bulk, it was dubbed "the triumph of thrust over aerodynamics." [[Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]] crews called their F-4s the "Eisensau" (Iron Sow), "Fliegender Ziegelstein" (Flying Brick), and "Luftverteidigungsdiesel" (Air Defense Diesel). Imitating the spelling of the aircraft's name, fans of the F-4 ("Phantom Phanatics") call it the "Phabulous Phantom." Ground crewmen who worked on the aircraft are known as "Phantom Phixers."<ref name="Boeing"/>

==The Spook==
[[image:Spook_1000.jpg|75px|right]]
As famous as the aircraft itself is its emblem, a whimsical cartoon ghost called '''The Spook'''. It was created by a McDonnell Douglas technical artist Anthony "Tony" Wong for shoulder patches. The name Spook was coined by the crews of either the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing or the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at [[MacDill AFB]]. The figure is ubiquitous, appearing on every imaginable item associated with the F-4. The Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions. For example, the British Spook sometimes wears a bowler hat and smokes a pipe. <ref name="Boeing"/>
