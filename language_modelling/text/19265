'''"Easy"''' is a [[1977]] hit single by [[The Commodores]] for the [[Motown]] label, from their fifth studio album, ''[[Commodores (album)|Commodores]]''. Written by Commodores lead singer [[Lionel Richie]], the song, a slow [[ballad]] with [[country and western]] roots, expresses a man's feelings as he leaves his lover and ends their relationship. Instead of being depressed about the break-up, the narrator states that he is instead "easy like Sunday morning."

The single was released in the wake of the failure of the Commodores' single "Just to Be Close to You" at pop radio. Richie wrote "Easy" with the intention of it becoming a crossover hit for the group. "Easy" reached number-one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks|Billboard R&B chart]], and number-four on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Before "Easy's" success, the Commodores had primarily been a [[funk]] band, but the success of "Easy" paved the way for similar Richie-composed ballads such as "Three Times a Lady", and also for Richie's later solo hits.

"Easy" has been extensively covered by artists such as [[Clarence Carter]], [[John Wesley Ryles]], [[Jimmy Lindsay]], [[Canadian Idol]] finalist [[Jason Greeley]], [[American Idol]] winner [[Taylor Hicks]] and others. [[Faith No More]] released a successful cover of "Easy" in 1993. It was originally issued on the 1993 E.P. ''[[Songs To Make Love To]]'', and later included on the European version of their album ''[[Angel Dust (album)|Angel Dust]]''.
