'''Demosthenes''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|d|<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|m|<U+0252>|s|.|<U+03B8>|<U+0259>|n|i<U+02D0>|z|}}, {{lang-el|<U+0394><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>, ''D<U+0113>mosth<U+00E9>n<U+0113>s''}} {{IPA-el|d<U+025B><U+02D0>most<U+02B0><U+00E9>n<U+025B><U+02D0>s|}}; 384<U+2013>322&nbsp;[[Common Era|BC]]) was a prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Politician|statesman]] and [[orator]] of [[History of Athens|ancient Athens]]. His [[Public speaking|orations]] constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the [[politics]] and culture of [[ancient Greece]] during the 4th century&nbsp;BC. Demosthenes learned [[rhetoric]] by studying the [[Speech (public address)|speeches]] of previous great orators.  He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer ([[Logographer (legal)|logographer]]) and a [[Ancient Greek law|lawyer]], writing speeches for use in private [[Lawsuit|legal suits]].

Demosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354&nbsp;BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the other Greek states. After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Alexander the Great]]. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by [[Archias of Thurii|Archias]], Antipater's confidant.

The ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest [[Attic orators]] and logographers. [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] likened Demosthenes to a blazing thunderbolt, and argued that he "perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed".<ref>Longinus, ''On the Sublime'', 12.4, 34.4<br/>* D.C. Innes, 'Longinus and Caecilius", 277&ndash;279</ref>  [[Quintilian]] extolled him as ''lex orandi'' ("the standard of oratory"), and [[Cicero]] said about him that ''inter omnis unus excellat'' ("he stands alone among all the orators"), and he also acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" who lacked nothing.<ref name="Cic35">Cicero, ''Brutus'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/brut.shtml#35 35], ''Orator'', II.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#6 6]; Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', X, 1.[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio10.shtml#1 76]<br/>* D.C.

Demosthenes was born in 384&nbsp;BC, during the last year of the 98th&nbsp;[[Olympiad]] or the first year of the 99th&nbsp;Olympiad.<ref name="Weil1">H.

Thomsen, ''The Looting of the Estate of the Elder Demosthenes'', 61</ref>

As soon as Demosthenes came of age in 366&nbsp;BC, he demanded they render an account of their management. According to Demosthenes, the account revealed the misappropriation of his property. Although his father left an estate of nearly fourteen [[Attic talent|talents]], (equivalent to about 220 years of a laborer's income at standard wages, or 11 million dollars in terms of median US annual incomes)<ref name="Aph4">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 1'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074%3Aspeech%3D27%3Asection%3D4 4]<br/>* D.M.

The courts fixed Demosthenes' damages at ten talents.<ref name="AphIII59">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 3'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074%3Aspeech%3D29%3Asection%3D59 59]<br/>* D.M.

Badian, "The Road to Prominence", 18</ref>

According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], Demosthenes was married once. The only information about his wife, whose name is unknown, is that she was the daughter of Heliodorus, a prominent citizen.<ref name="pseudo13">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 847c</ref> Demosthenes also had a daughter, "the only one who ever called him father", according to Aeschines' in a trenchant remark.<ref name="Ctesiphon77">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D77 77]</ref> His daughter died young and unmarried a few days before Philip II's death.<ref name="Ctesiphon77" />

In his speeches, Aeschines uses [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] relations of Demosthenes as a means to attack him. In the case of Aristion, a youth from [[Plataea]] who lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house, Aeschines mocks the "scandalous" and "improper" relation.<ref>Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D162 162]</ref> In another speech, Aeschines brings up the pederastic relation of his opponent with a boy called Cnosion. The slander that Demosthenes' wife also slept with the boy suggests that the relationship was contemporary with his marriage.<ref>Aeschines, ''On the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D149 149]; Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'', XIII, 63<br/>* C.A. Cox, ''Household Interests'', 202</ref> Aeschines claims that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men, such as Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, whom he allegedly deceived with the pretence that he could make him a great orator. Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad ''[[Pederasty in ancient Greece#Terminology|erastes]]'' to Aristarchus so as not even to deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his ''eromenos'' by pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as to get his hands on the boy's inheritance. Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.<ref>Aeschines, ''On the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D148 148<U+2013>150], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D165 165<U+2013>166]<br/>* A.W.

===Education===
[[Image:DemosthPracticing.jpg|thumb|right|''Demosthenes Practising Oratory'' by [[Jean-Jules-Antoine Lecomte du Nouy]] (1842<U+2013>1923). Demosthenes used to study in an underground room he constructed himself. He also used to talk with pebbles in his mouth and recited verses while running.<ref>Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D11%3Asection%3D1 11.1]</ref> To strengthen his voice, he spoke on the seashore over the roar of the waves.]]
Between his coming of age in 366&nbsp;BC and the trials that took place in 364&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes and his guardians negotiated acrimoniously but were unable to reach an agreement, for neither side was willing to make concessions.<ref name="HeliosMacD">D.M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 3 (''passim''); {{cite encyclopedia|title=Demosthenes|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]|year=1952}}</ref> At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. As an adolescent, his curiosity had been noticed by the orator [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]], who was then at the height of his reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance.<ref name="Pl5">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D1 5.1&ndash;3]</ref> According to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a German [[philology|philologist]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[Constantine Paparrigopoulos]], a major Greek [[historian]], Demosthenes was a student of [[Isocrates]];<ref name="Nietzsche233-235">F. Nietzsche, ''Lessons of Rhetoric'', 233<U+2013>235; K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396<U+2013>398</ref> according to Cicero, Quintillian and the Roman biographer Hermippus, he was a student of [[Plato]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D5 5.5]</ref> [[Lucian]], a Roman-Syrian rhetorician and [[satire|satirist]], lists the philosophers [[Aristotle]], [[Theophrastus]] and [[Xenocrates]] among his teachers.<ref name="Lucian1">Lucian, ''Demosthenes, An Encomium'', 12</ref> These claims are nowadays disputed.{{Ref label|C|c|none}} According to Plutarch, Demosthenes employed [[Isaeus]] as his master in Rhetoric, even though Isocrates was then teaching this subject, either because he could not pay Isocrates the prescribed fee or because Demosthenes believed Isaeus' style better suited a vigorous and astute orator such as himself .<ref>Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D4 5.4]</ref> [[Ernst Curtius|Curtius]], a German [[archaeologist]] and historian, likened the relation between Isaeus and Demosthenes to "an intellectual armed alliance".<ref name="Jebb">R.

It has also been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000&nbsp;[[drachma]]e (somewhat over 1.5&nbsp;talents) on the condition that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of Rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to Demosthenes, his new pupil.<ref name="Jebb" /> Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge.<ref name="Suda">Suda, article [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&enlogin=guest&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=Iota,620 Isaeus]</ref> According to [[Sir Richard C.

Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 83</ref> Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the ''Illiterate Book-Fancier,'' Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in Demosthenes' own handwriting.<ref name="Lucian2">Lucian, ''The Illiterate Book-Fancier'', 4</ref> These references hint at his respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.<ref name="Weil11">H. Weil, ''Biography of Demothenes'', 10<U+2013>11</ref>

===Speech training===
According to Plutarch, when Demosthenes first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, "which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess".<ref name="Pl6">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D3 6.3]</ref> Some citizens, however, discerned his talent. When he first left the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]] (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying his diction was very much like that of [[Pericles]].<ref>Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D4 6.4]</ref> Another time, after the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a friendly conversation with him.<ref name="Pl7">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D1 7.1]</ref>

As a boy Demosthenes had a [[speech impediment]]: Plutarch refers to a weakness in his voice of "a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke."<ref name="Pl6" /> There are problems in Plutarch's account, however, and it is probable that Demosthenes actually suffered [[rhotacism]], mispronouncing <U+03C1> (r) as <U+03BB> (l).<ref>H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On the Crown'', 211, note 180</ref> Aeschines taunted him and referred to him in his speeches by the nickname "Batalus",{{Ref label|D|d|none}} apparently invented by Demosthenes' pedagogues or by the little boys with whom he was playing.<ref name="AischI126">Aeschines, ''Against Timarchus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D126 126]; Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D99 99]</ref>  Demosthenes undertook a disciplined program to overcome his weaknesses and improve his delivery, including diction, voice and gestures.<ref name="Pl6-7">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D6%3Asection%3D1 6&ndash;7]</ref> According to one story, when he was asked to name the three most important elements in oratory, he replied "Delivery, delivery and delivery!"<ref>Cicero, ''De Oratore'', 3.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0120%3Abook%3D3%3Asection%3D213 213]<br/>* G.

Badian, "The Road to Prominence", 16</ref>

==Career==
===Legal career===
To make his living, Demosthenes became a professional litigant, both as a "logographer", writing speeches for use in private legal suits, and advocate ("synegoros") speaking on another's behalf. He seems to have been able to manage any kind of case, adapting his skills to almost any client, including wealthy and powerful men. It is not unlikely that he became a teacher of rhetoric and that he brought pupils into court with him. However, though he probably continued writing speeches throughout his career,{{Ref label|E|e|none}} he stopped working as an advocate once he entered the political arena.<ref>Demosthenes, ''Against Zenothemis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0076%3Aspeech%3D32%3Asection%3D32 32]<br/>* G.

| style="text-align: left;" | Demosthenes (''On the Crown'', 210)<U+2014>The orator's defense of the honor of the courts was in contrast to the improper actions of which Aeschines accused him.
|}

Judicial oratory had become a significant literary genre by the second half of the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]] and [[Andocides]]. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by force or bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law<U+2014>conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 498&ndash;500<br/>* H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 263 (note 275)</ref>

Since Athenian politicians were often indicted by their opponents, there wasn't always a clear distinction between "private" and "public" cases, and thus a career as a logographer opened the way for Demosthenes to embark on his political career.<ref>J Vince, ''Demosthenes Orations'', Intro. xii</ref> An Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, which enabled him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. It also left him open to allegations of malpractice. Thus for example Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents; in particular, that he wrote a speech for Phormion (350 BC), a wealthy banker, and then communicated it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] against Phormion.<ref name="AischIII173">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D173 173]; Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D165 165]</ref> Plutarch much later supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes "was thought to have acted dishonorably"<ref name="Pl15">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 15</ref> and he also accused Demosthenes of writing speeches for both sides. It has often been argued that the deception, if there was one, involved a political ''[[quid pro quo]]'', whereby Apollodorus secretly pledged support for unpopular reforms that Demosthenes was pursuing in the greater, public interest<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 516</ref> (i.e. the diversion of [[Theorica|Theoric Funds]] to military purposes).

Demosthenes was admitted to his deme as a citizen with full rights probably in 366&nbsp;BC, and he soon demonstrated an interest in politics.<ref name=Bad16 /> In 363 and 359&nbsp;BC, he assumed the office of the [[trierarch]], being responsible for the outfitting and maintenance of a [[trireme]].<ref>A.W.

Between 355&ndash;351&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes continued practicing law privately while he was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote ''Against Androtion'' and ''Against Leptines'', two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 177&ndash;178</ref> In ''Against Timocrates'' and ''Against Aristocrates'', he advocated eliminating corruption.<ref>E. Badian, "The Road to Prominence", 29&ndash;30</ref> All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as the importance of the navy, of alliances and of national honor,<ref name="Romilly116-117">J.

MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 7 (''pr.'')</ref>

In Demosthenes' time different political goals developed around personalities. Instead of electioneering, Athenian politicians used litigation and defamation to remove rivals from government processes. Often they indicted each other for breaches of the statute laws (graph<U+0113> paran<U+00F3>m<U+014D>n), but accusations of bribery and corruption were ubiquitous in all cases, being part of the political dialogue. The orators often resorted to "character assassination" (diabol<U+0113>, loidoria) tactics, both
in the courts and in the Assembly. The rancorous and often hilariously exaggerated accusations, satirized by [[Old Comedy]], were sustained by innuendo, inferences about motives, and a complete absence of proof; as J.H. Vince states "there was no room for chivalry in Athenian political life".<ref>E.M. Harris, "Demosthenes' Speech against Meidias", 117&ndash;118; J.H. Vince, ''Demosthenes Orations'', I, Intro. xii; N. Worman, "Insult and Oral Excess", 1&ndash;2</ref> Such rivalry enabled the "demos" or citizen-body to reign supreme as judge, jury and executioner.<ref>H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 9, 22</ref> Demosthenes was to become fully engaged in this kind of litigation and he was also to be instrumental in developing the power of the [[Areopagus]] to indict individuals for treason, invoked in the ecclesia by a process called "<U+1F00><U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03C6><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03C2>".<ref>H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 187</ref>

In 354&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes delivered his first political oration, ''On the Navy'', in which he espoused moderation and proposed the reform of "symmories" (boards) as a source of funding for the Athenian fleet.<ref name="Tsatsos88">E. Badian, "The Road to Prominence", 29&ndash;30; K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 88</ref> In 352&nbsp;BC, he delivered ''For the Megalopolitans'' and, in 351&nbsp;BC, ''On the Liberty of the Rhodians.'' In both speeches he opposed [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342&nbsp;BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism in the internal affairs of the other Greek cities.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 174&ndash;175</ref> Contrary to Eubulus' policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] against [[Sparta]] or [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 180&ndash;183</ref> His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens' needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 180, 183 (note 91); T.N. Habinek, ''Ancient Rhetoric and Oratory'', 21; D. Phillips, ''Athenian Political Oratory'', 72</ref>

Although his early orations were unsuccessful and reveal a lack of real conviction and of coherent strategic and political prioritization,<ref>E. Badian, "The Road to Prominence", 36</ref> Demosthenes established himself as an important political personality and broke with Eubulus' faction, a prominent member of which was Aeschines.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 181&ndash;182</ref> He thus laid the foundations for his future political successes and for becoming the leader of his own "party" (the issue of whether the modern concept of political parties can be applied in the [[Athenian democracy]] is hotly disputed among modern scholars<ref>M.H. Hansen, ''The Athenian Democracy'', 177</ref>).

===Confrontation with Philip II===

Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357&nbsp;BC, when Philip seized [[Amphipolis]] and [[Pydna]], Athens had been formally at war with the [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].<ref>D. Phillips, ''Athenian Political Oratory'', 69</ref> In 352&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes characterized Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years.<ref name="Arist121">Demosthenes, ''Against Aristocrates'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074%3Aspeech%3D23%3Asection%3D121 121]</ref> A year later he criticized those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the King of [[Persia]].<ref name="Rhodians24">Demosthenes, ''For the Liberty of the Rhodians'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/For the Freedom of the Rhodians#15:24|24]]</ref>

In 352&nbsp;BC, Athenian troops successfully opposed Philip at [[Thermopylae]],<ref name="Embassy319">Demosthenes, ''First Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic I#4:17|17]]; ''On the False Embassy'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Embassy#19:319|319]]<br/>* E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92)</ref> but the Macedonian victory over the [[Phocians]] at the [[Battle of Crocus Field]] shook Demosthenes. In 351&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to [[Jacqueline de Romilly]], a French philologist and member of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]], the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'<U+00EA>tre (reason for existence).<ref name="Romilly116-117" /> Demosthenes saw the King of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens' own creation; in the ''First Philippic'' he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: "Even if something happens to him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...]".<ref>Demosthenes, ''First Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic I#4:11|11]]<br/>* G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 519&ndash;520</ref>

The theme of the ''First Philippic'' (351<U+2013>350&nbsp;BC) was preparedness and the reform of the theoric fund,{{Ref label|F|f|none}} a mainstay of Eubulus' policy.<ref name="Romilly116-117" /> In his rousing call for resistance, Demosthenes asked his countrymen to take the necessary action and asserted that "for a free people there can be no greater compulsion than shame for their position".<ref>Demosthenes, ''First Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic I#4:10|10]]</ref> He thus provided for the first time a plan and specific recommendations for the strategy to be adopted against Philip in the north.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 183&ndash;184</ref> Among other things, the plan called for the creation of a rapid-response force, to be created cheaply with each hoplite to be paid only ten [[drachmas]] (two [[obol (coin)|Obols]] per day), which was less than the average pay for unskilled labourers in Athens{{spaced ndash}}implying that the hoplite was expected to make up the deficiency in pay by looting.<ref>First Philippic 28, cited by J.

From this moment until 341&nbsp;BC, all of Demosthenes' speeches referred to the same issue, the struggle against Philip. In 349&nbsp;BC, Philip attacked [[Olynthus]], an ally of Athens. In the three ''Olynthiacs'', Demosthenes criticized his compatriots for being idle and urged Athens to help Olynthus.<ref name="OlynthII23">Demosthenes, ''First Olynthiac'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Olynthiac I#1:3|3]]; Demosthenes, ''Second Olynthiac'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Olynthiac II#2:3|3]]<br/>* E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 185</ref> He also insulted Philip by calling him a "barbarian".{{Ref label|G|g|none}} Despite Demosthenes' strong advocacy, the Athenians would not manage to prevent the falling of the city to the Macedonians. Almost simultaneously, probably on Eubulus' recommendation, they engaged in a war in [[Euboea]] against Philip, which ended in stalemate.<ref name="Peace5">Demosthenes, ''On the Peace'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Peace#5:5|5]]<br/>* E.M.

====Case of Meidias (348&nbsp;BC)====
{{details|Against Meidias}}
In 348&nbsp;BC a peculiar event occurred: [[Meidias]], a wealthy Athenian, publicly slapped Demosthenes, who was at the time a choregos at the [[Dionysia|Greater Dionysia]], a large religious festival in honour of the god [[Dionysus]].<ref name="Usher226" /> Meidias was a friend of Eubulus and supporter of the unsuccessful excursion in Euboea.<ref name="Peace5II">Demosthenes, ''On the Peace'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Peace#5:5|5]]<br/>* E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 174 (note 47)</ref> He also was an old enemy of Demosthenes; in 361&nbsp;BC he had broken violently into his house, with his brother Thrasylochus, to take possession of it.<ref name="Meidias223">Demosthenes, ''Against Meidias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074%3Aspeech%3D21%3Asection%3D78 78&ndash;80]</ref>

Demosthenes decided to prosecute his wealthy opponent and wrote the judicial oration ''Against Meidias''. This speech gives valuable information about Athenian law at the time and especially about the Greek concept of [[Hubris|hybris]] (aggravated assault), which was regarded as a crime not only against the city but against society as a whole.<ref>H. Yunis, ''The Rhetoric of Law in 4th Century Athens'', 206</ref> He stated that a democratic state perishes if the [[rule of law]] is undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due "to the strength of the laws".<ref name="Meidias223">Demosthenes, ''Against Meidias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074&layout=&loc=21.223 223]</ref> There is no consensus among scholars either on whether Demosthenes finally delivered ''Against Meidias'' either on the veracity of Aeschines' accusation that Demosthenes was bribed to drop the charges.{{Ref label|H|h|none}}

====Peace of Philocrates (347<U+2013>345&nbsp;BC)====
{{details|Peace of Philocrates}}
In 348&nbsp;BC, Philip conquered Olynthus and razed it to the ground; then conquered the entire [[Chalkidiki|Chalcidice]] and all the states of the Chalcidic federation that Olynthus had once led.<ref name="PhilippicIII56">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:56|56]]<br/>* E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 187</ref> After these Macedonian victories, Athens sued for peace with Macedon. Demosthenes was among those who favored compromise. In 347&nbsp;BC, an Athenian delegation, comprising Demosthenes, Aeschines and Philocrates, was officially sent to [[Pella]] to negotiate a peace treaty. In his first encounter with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have collapsed from fright.<ref name="Aeschines34">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D2%3Asection%3D34 34]<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 12</ref>

The ecclesia officially accepted Philip's harsh terms, including the renouncement of their claim to Amphipolis. However, when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Phillip under oath, which was required to conclude the treaty, he was campaigning abroad.<ref name="PhilippicIII15">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:15|15]]<br/>* G. Cawkwell, ''Philip II of Macedon'', 102&ndash;103</ref> He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification.<ref name="Crown25-27">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:25|25<U+2013>27]]<br/>* G. Cawkwell, ''Philip II of Macedon'', 102&ndash;103</ref> Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel to the place where they would find Philip and swear him in without delay.<ref name="Crown25-27" /> Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his campaign in [[Thrace]].<ref name="Crown30">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:30|30]]<br/>* G. Cawkwell, ''Philip II of Macedon'', 102&ndash;103</ref>

Philip swore to the treaty, but he delayed the departure of the Athenian envoys, who had yet to receive the oaths from Macedon's allies in [[Thessaly]] and elsewhere. Finally, peace was sworn at [[Pherae]], where Philip accompanied the Athenian delegation, after he had completed his military preparations to move south. Demosthenes accused the other envoys of venality and of facilitating Philip's plans with their stance.<ref name="Crown31">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:31|31]]<br/>* G. Cawkwell, ''Philip II of Macedon'', 102&ndash;105; D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 12</ref> Just after the conclusion of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip passed Thermopylae, and subdued [[Phocis]]; Athens made no move to support the Phocians.<ref name="Crown36">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:36|36]]; Demosthenes, ''On the Peace'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Peace#5:10|10]]<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 12</ref> Supported by Thebes and Thessaly, Macedon took control of Phocis' votes in the [[Amphictyonic League]], a Greek religious organization formed to support the greater temples of [[Apollo]] and [[Demeter]].<ref name="Crown43">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:43|43]]</ref> Despite some reluctance on the part of the Athenian leaders, Athens finally accepted Philip's entry into the Council of the League.<ref name="Embassy111-113">Demosthenes, ''On the False Embassy'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Embassy#19:111|111<U+2013>113]]<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 12</ref> Demosthenes was among those who adopted a pragmatic approach, and recommended this stance in his oration ''[[On the Peace]]''. For Edmund M. Burke, this speech landmarks a moment of maturation in Demosthenes' career: after Philip's successful campaign in 346&nbsp;BC, the Athenian statesman realized that, if he was to lead his city against the Macedonians, he had "to adjust his voice, to become less partisan in tone".<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 188&ndash;189</ref>

====Second and Third Philippics (344<U+2013>341&nbsp;BC)====
[[Image:Gallipoli peninsula from space.png|thumb|Satellite image of the Thracian Chersonese and the surrounding area. The Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and Macedon. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338&nbsp;BC.]]
:''For more details on this topic, see [[Second Philippic]], [[On the Chersonese]], [[Third Philippic]]''
In 344&nbsp;BC Demosthenes travelled to the [[Peloponnese]], in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful.<ref name="PhilippicII19">Demosthenes, ''Second Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic II#6:19|19]]</ref> Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities.<ref name="Buckley">T. Buckley, ''Aspects of Greek History 750-323 BC,'' 480</ref> In response, Demosthenes delivered the ''Second Philippic'', a vehement attack against Philip.  In 343&nbsp;BC Demosthenes delivered ''[[On the False Embassy]]'' against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Aeschines,'' 840c<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 12 ''(in fine)''</ref>

In 343&nbsp;BC, Macedonian forces were conducting campaigns in [[Epirus]] and, in 342&nbsp;BC, Philip campaigned in Thrace.<ref name="PhilippicIII17">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:17|17]]</ref> He also negotiated with the Athenians an amendment to the Peace of Philocrates.<ref name="Halonnesus18">Demosthenes (or Hegesippus), ''On Halonnesus,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0070%3Aspeech%3D7%3Asection%3D18 18<U+2013>23]<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 13</ref> When the Macedonian army approached [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonese]] (now known as the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]]), an Athenian general named [[Diopeithes]] ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, thereby inciting Philip's rage. Because of this turbulence, the Athenian Assembly convened. Demosthenes delivered ''On the Chersonese'' and convinced the Athenians not to recall Diopeithes. Also in 342&nbsp;BC, he delivered the ''Third Philippic'', which is considered to be the best of his political orations.<ref name="Tsatsos245">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 245</ref>  Using all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for a burst of energy from the Athenian people. He told them that it would be "better to die a thousand times than pay court to Philip".<ref>Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:65|65]]<br/>* D.M. MacDowell, ''Demosthenes the Orator'', ch. 13</ref> Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines.

====Battle of Chaeronea (338&nbsp;BC)====
{{details|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}
[[Image:Chaeronea map.gif|thumb|right|The battle of Chaeronea took place the autumn of 338&nbsp;BC and resulted in a significant victory for Philip, who established Macedon's supremacy over the Greek cities.]]
In 341&nbsp;BC Demosthenes was sent to [[Byzantium]], where he sought to renew its alliance with Athens. Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres, [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes. The Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339&nbsp;BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern Greece, assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council. During a meeting of the Council, Philip accused the [[Amfissa|Amfissian]] [[Locrians]] of intruding on consecrated ground. The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress.<ref name="On the Crown151">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:149|149]], [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:150|150]], [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:151|151]]<br/> * C.

Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of 339<U+2013>338&nbsp;BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338&nbsp;BC. He then turned south-east down the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] valley, seized [[Elateia]], and restored the fortifications of the city.<ref name="On the Crown152">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:152|152]]<br/>* K.

At the same time, Athens orchestrated the creation of an alliance with Euboea, [[Megara]], [[Achaea]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Acarnania]] and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes' allegiance.<ref name="On the Crown153">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:153|153]]<br/>* K.

Weil, ''Biography of Demosthenes'', 41&ndash;42</ref> Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes' control of Boeotia was recognized, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.<ref name="Rhodes317">P.J. Rhodes, ''A History of the Classical World'', 317</ref>

While the Athenians and the Thebans were preparing themselves for war, Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing in vain a new peace treaty.<ref name="Pl18">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D18%3Asection%3D3 18.3]<br/>* K.

After Chaeronea, Philip inflicted a harsh punishment upon Thebes, but made peace with Athens on very lenient terms. Demosthenes encouraged the fortification of Athens and was chosen by the ecclesia to deliver the [[Demosthenes' Funeral Oration|Funeral Oration]].<ref name="On the Crown299">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:285|285]], [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:299|299]]</ref> In 337&nbsp;BC, Philip created the [[League of Corinth]], a confederation of Greek states under his leadership, and returned to Pella.<ref>L.A. Tritle, ''The Greek World in the Fourth Century'', 123</ref> In 336&nbsp;BC, Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter, Cleopatra of Macedon, to King [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]]. The Macedonian army swiftly proclaimed Alexander III of Macedon, then twenty years old, as the new King of Macedon. Greek cities like Athens and Thebes saw in this change of leadership an opportunity to regain their full independence. Demosthenes celebrated Philip's assassination and played a leading part in his city's uprising. According to Aeschines, "it was but the seventh day after the death of his daughter, and though the ceremonies of mourning were not yet completed, he put a garland on his head and white raiment on his body, and there he stood making thank-offerings, violating all decency."<ref name="Ctesiphon77" /> Demosthenes also sent envoys to [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], whom he considered to be an internal opponent of Alexander.<ref>P. Green, ''Alexander of Macedon,'' 119</ref> Nonetheless, Alexander moved swiftly to Thebes, which submitted shortly after his appearance at its gates. When the Athenians learned that Alexander had moved quickly to Boeotia, they panicked and begged the new King of Macedon for mercy. Alexander admonished them but imposed no punishment.

In 335&nbsp;BC Alexander felt free to engage the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]], but, while he was campaigning in the north, Demosthenes spread a rumor<U+2014>even producing a bloodstained messenger<U+2014>that Alexander and all of his expeditionary force had been slaughtered by the [[Triballi]]ans.<ref>Demades, ''On the Twelve Years'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0066%3Aspeech%3D1%3Asection%3D17 17]<br/>* J.R.

Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336&nbsp;BC, the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honor Demosthenes for his services to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330&nbsp;BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech,<ref name="Tsatsos301">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 301; "Demosthenes". [[Encyclopaedia The Helios]]. 1952.</ref> ''On the Crown,'' Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honor and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens.<ref name="Cr321">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:321|321]]</ref> He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.<ref name="Duncan">A.

====Case of Harpalus and death====

[[File:Temple of Poseidon Poros.jpg|thumbnail|right|The site of the temple of Poseidon, [[Kalaureia]], where Demosthenes committed suicide.]]In 324&nbsp;BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures, absconded and sought refuge in Athens.{{Ref label|K|k|none}} The Assembly had initially refused to accept him, following Demosthenes' advice, but finally Harpalus entered Athens. He was imprisoned after a proposal of Demosthenes and Phocion, despite the dissent of [[Hypereides]], an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes. Additionally, the ecclesia decided to take control of Harpalus' money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes. When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he possessed. Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the Areopagus conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During the trial, Hypereides argued that Demosthenes did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus. Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.<ref name="Hypereides">Hypereides, ''Against Demosthenes,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0140%3Aspeech%3D5%3Afragment%3D3 3]; Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D25%3Asection%3D2 25.2&ndash;26.4]<br/>* I.

After Alexander's death in 323&nbsp;BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek independence from Macedon in what became known as the [[Lamian War]]. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of [[Kalaureia]] (modern-day [[Poros]]), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family.<ref name="Pl29">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D29%3Asection%3D1 29]</ref> When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of [[Creon]] in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died.<ref name="Pl29" /> Years after Demosthenes' suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honor him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the [[Prytaneum]].<ref name="pseudo14">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 847d</ref>

==Assessments==
===Political career===
Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for not being of a fickle disposition. Rebutting historian [[Theopompus]], the biographer insists that for "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose".<ref name="Pl13">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 13.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0039%3Achapter%3D13%3Asection%3D1 1]</ref> On the other hand, [[Polybius]], a Greek historian of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean world]], was highly critical of Demosthenes' policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the only thing the Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. "And had it not been for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes".<ref name="Polybius">Polybius, ''Histories'', 18, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Abook%3D18%3Achapter%3D14 14]</ref>

For this depends upon his own nature; while his power and his influence are determined by external causes. And in me, you will find, this loyalty has persisted unalloyed...For from the very first, I chose the straight and honest path in public life: I chose to foster the honour, the supremacy, the good name of my country, to seek to enhance them, and to stand or fall with them."

Paparrigopoulos extols Demosthenes' patriotism, but criticizes him as being short-sighted. According to this critique, Demosthenes should have understood that the ancient Greek states could only survive unified under the leadership of Macedon.<ref>K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396<U+2013>398</ref> Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip's inevitable triumph.<ref name="Carey">C. Carey, ''Aeschines'', 12&ndash;14</ref> He is criticized for having overrated Athens' capacity to revive and challenge Macedon.<ref name = "Tsatsos318-326"/> His city had lost most of its Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and was master of enormous mineral wealth. Chris Carey, a professor of Greek in [[University College London|UCL]], concludes that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist.<ref name="Carey" /> Nevertheless, the same scholar underscores that "pragmatists" like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that which is just and honorable, before their own safety and preservation.<ref name="Pl13" /> The people preferred Demosthenes' activism and even the bitter defeat at Chaeronea was regarded as a price worth paying in the attempt to retain freedom and influence.<ref name="Carey" /> According to Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickarde, success may be a poor criterion for judging the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were motivated by the ideal of political liberty.<ref name="Pickard">A.W. Pickard, ''Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom ,'' 490</ref> Athens was asked by Philip to sacrifice its freedom and its democracy, while Demosthenes longed for the city's brilliance.<ref name="Tsatsos318-326">K.

De Romilly, ''A Short History of Greek Literature,'' 120<U+2013>122</ref>

The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a hoplite indicates that he lacked any military skills. According to historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked.<ref name="Macaulay">T.B. Macaulay, ''On Mitford's History of Greece,'' 136</ref> Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent [[strategos|general]]. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business.<ref name="Macaulay" /> This contrast between Demosthenes' intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigor, stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:<ref name="Pl30">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 30<br/>* C.Carey, ''Aeschines'', 12&ndash;14; K.

In Demosthenes' initial judicial orations, the influence of both [[Lysias]] and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed.<ref name="Jebb"2>R. C. Jebb, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0077%3Achapter%3D19%3Asection%3D4 The Attic Orators from Antiphon to Isaeos]; K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 86</ref> Most of his extant speeches for private cases<U+2014>written early in his career<U+2014>show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, at this early stage of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 514-15</ref>

According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented the final stage in the development of Attic prose. Both Dionysius and Cicero assert that Demosthenes brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters.<ref name="Dionysius46">Cicero, ''Orator'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#76 76&ndash;101]; Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes'', 46<br/>* C. Wooten, "Cicero's Reactions to Demosthenes", 39</ref> He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work.<ref name="Romilly120-122" />

According to the classical scholar Harry Thurston Peck, Demosthenes "affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in the fact that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit."<ref name="Thurston">H.T. Peck,  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0062%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DD%3Aentry+group%3D4%3Aentry%3Ddemosthenes-harpers Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities]</ref> In this judgement, Peck agrees with Jaeger, who said that the imminent political decision imbued the Demosthenes' speech with a fascinating artistic power.<ref>W. Jaeger, ''Demosthenes'', 123<U+2013>124</ref> From his part, George A. Kennedy believes that his political speeches in the ecclesia were to become "the artistic exposition of reasoned views".<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 519</ref>

Demosthenes was apt at combining abruptness with the extended period, brevity with breadth. Hence, his style harmonizes with his fervent commitment.<ref name="Romilly120-122" /> His language is simple and natural, never far-fetched or artificial. According to Jebb, Demosthenes was a true artist who could make his art obey him.<ref name="Jebb" /> For his part, Aeschines stigmatized his intensity, attributing to his rival strings of absurd and incoherent images.<ref name="Ctesiphon166">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002%3Aspeech%3D3%3Asection%3D139 166]</ref> Dionysius stated that Demosthenes' only shortcoming is the lack of humor, although Quintilian regards this deficiency as a virtue.<ref name="Dionysius56">Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes'', 56; Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', VI, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0063%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D3%3Asection%3D2 3.2]</ref> In a now lost letter of his, Cicero, though an admirer of the Athenian orator, he claimed that occasionally Demosthenes "nods", and elsewhere Cicero also argued that, although he is pre-eminent, Demosthenes sometimes fails to satisfy his ears.<ref>Cicero, ''Orator'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#104 104]; Plutarch, ''Cicero'', 24.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0016%3Achapter%3D24%3Asection%3D4 4]<br/>* D.C.

Besides his style, Cicero also admired other aspects of Demosthenes's works, such as the good prose rhythm, and the way he structured and arranged the material in his orations.<ref>C. Wooten, "Cicero's Reactions to Demosthenes", 38&ndash;40</ref> According to the Roman statesman, Demosthenes regarded "delivery" (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style.<ref name="Cic38">Cicero, ''Brutus'', [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/brut.shtml#38 38], [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/brut.shtml#142 142]</ref> Although he lacked Aeschines' charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words.<ref>F.

However, the use of physical gestures wasn't an integral or developed part of rhetorical training in his day.<ref>H.

{{cquote|The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.}}

During the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence.<ref>A.J.L. Blanshard & T.A.

==Works and transmission==
{{details|Works of Demosthenes}}
The "publication" and distribution of prose texts was common practice in Athens by the latter half of the fourth century&nbsp;BC and Demosthenes was among the Athenian politicians who set the trend, publishing many or even all of his orations.<ref name="Weil66-67">H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 26; H. Weil, ''Biography of Demosthenes,'' 66&ndash;67</ref> After his death, texts of his speeches survived in Athens (possibly forming part of the library of Cicero's friend, Atticus, though their fate is otherwise unknown), and in the [[Library of Alexandria]]. However, the speeches that Demosthenes "published"  might have differed from the original speeches that were actually delivered (there are indications that he rewrote them with readers in mind) and therefore it is possible also that he "published" different versions of any one speech, differences that could have impacted on the Alexandrian edition of his works and thus on all subsequent editions down to the present day.<ref>H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On The Crown'', 26&ndash;27</ref>

The Alexandrian texts were incorporated into the body of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period. From then until the fourth century&nbsp;AD, copies of his orations multiplied and they were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth century&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Yunis28">H. Yunis, ''Demosthenes: On the Crown'', 28</ref> In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes' survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). [[Friedrich Blass]], a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant.<ref name="Blass1">F. Blass, ''Die attische Beredsamkeit'', III, 2, 60</ref>  Modern editions of these speeches are based on four [[manuscript]]s of the tenth and eleventh centuries&nbsp;AD.<ref name="Gibson1">C.A. Gibson, ''Interpreting a Classic,'' 1; K.A. Kapparis, ''Apollodoros against Neaira,'' 62</ref>

Some of the speeches that comprise the "Demosthenic corpus" are known to have been written by other authors, though scholars differ over which speeches these are.{{Ref label|M|m|none}} Irrespective of their status, the speeches attributed to Demosthenes are often grouped in three genres first defined by Aristotle:<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 500</ref>
*''Symbouleutic'' or ''political'', considering the expediency of future actions<U+2014>sixteen such speeches are included in the Demosthenic corpus;{{Ref label|M|m|none}}
*''Dicanic'' or ''judicial'', assessing the justice of past actions<U+2014>only about ten of these are cases in which Demosthenes was personally involved, the rest were written for other speakers;<ref>G. Kennedy, "Oratory", 514</ref>
*''Epideictic'' or ''sophistic display'', attributing praise or blame, often delivered at public ceremonies<U+2014>only two speeches have been included in the Demosthenic corpus, one a funeral speech that has been dismissed as a "rather poor" example of his work, and the other  probably spurious.<ref>G Kennedy, "Oratory", 510</ref>

In addition to the speeches, there are fifty-six [[prologue]]s (openings of speeches). They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by [[Callimachus]], who believed them genuine.<ref name="MacKie135">I. Worthington, ''Oral Performance'', 135</ref> Modern scholars are divided: some reject them, while others, such as Blass, believe they are authentic.<ref name="Blass287">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Demosthenes|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios|year=1952}}; F.

Burke argues that, if this was indeed a law of Eubulus, it would have served "as a means to check a too-aggressive and expensive interventionism [...] allowing for the controlled expenditures on other items, including construction for defense". Thus Burke believes that in the Eubulan period, the Theoric Fund was used not only as allowances for public entertainment but also for a variety of projects, including public works.<ref>E.M. Burke, "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 175, 185</ref> As Burke also points out, in his later and more "mature" political career, Demosthenes no longer criticized "theorika"; in fact, in his ''Fourth Philippic'' (341&ndash;340&nbsp;BC), he defended theoric spending.<ref>Demosthenes, ''Fourth Philippic'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0070%3Aspeech%3D10%3Asection%3D35 35&ndash;45]<br/>* E.M.

[[Kenneth Dover]] also endorsed Aeschines' account, and argued that, although the speech was never delivered in court, Demosthenes put into circulation an attack on Meidias.
