'''Belle da Costa Greene''' ([[December 13]], [[1883]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] - [[May 10]], [[1950]] in [[New York City, New York]])  was the [[librarian]] to [[J. P. Morgan]] and after his death she became the first director of the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]].

She was born '''Belle Marion Greener''' in [[Washington, D.C.]], and grew up there and in [[New York City]]. Her biographer Heidi Ardizzone lists Belle's birth date as November 26, 1879. Her mother was Genevieve Ida Fleet, a member of a well-known [[African American]] family in the nation's capital, while her father was [[Richard Theodore Greener]], an attorney who served as dean of the [[Howard University|Howard Law School]] and was the first black student and first black graduate of [[Harvard]] (class of 1870). After his separation from his wife (they never divorced), Greener became a U.S. diplomat posted to [[Siberia]], where he produced a second family with a Japanese woman.

After her parents' separation, the light-skinned Belle, her mother, and siblings passed as white and changed their surname to Greene to distance themselves from their father. Her mother changed her maiden name to Van Vliet, apparently in an effort to assume Dutch ancestry, while Belle dropped her middle name in favor of da Costa and began claiming a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] background to explain her dusky complexion. Eventually, she moved to [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where she worked at the [[Princeton University]] Library.

The financier J. P. Morgan had in 1902 engaged [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles F. McKim]] to build him a library to the east of his [[Madison Avenue]] [[brownstone]] as his collection already was too large for his study. To manage his collection he hired Greene as his personal librarian in 1905, having been introduced to her by his nephew, Junius, a Princeton student. Soon trusted for her expertise (she was an expert in illuminated manuscripts) as well as her bargaining prowess with dealers, Greene would spend millions of dollars not only buying but selling rare manuscripts, books and art. She has been described as smart and outspoken as well as beautiful and sensual. While she enjoyed a [[Bohemian]] freedom, she was also able to move with ease in elite society, known for her exotic looks and designer wardrobe.  "Just because I am a librarian," Greene reportedly announced, "doesn't mean I have to dress like one."

Not only did her bearing, style, and seemingly unlimited means attract notice, but "her role at the Morgan Library placed her at the center of the art trade and her friendship was coveted by every dealer." The power that she wielded for 43 years was unmatched. She told Morgan - who was willing to pay any price for important works - that her goal was to make his library "pre-eminent, especially for [[incunabula]], [[manuscripts]], [[bookbinding|bindings]], and the [[classics]]."

J.P. Morgan left her $50,000 in his will, which at that time was a significant sum, reportedly $800,000 in modern money. Asked if she was Morgan's mistress, she is said to have replied, "We tried!" She never married, however, and her most lasting romantic relationship was with the art expert [[Bernard Berenson]].

Greene retired in 1948 and died in [[New York City]] two years later.
