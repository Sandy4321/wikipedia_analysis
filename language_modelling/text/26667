'''Ted Arthur Haggard''' (born June 27, 1956) is an [[People of the United States|American]] [[Evangelism|evangelical]] [[pastor]].  Known as '''Pastor Ted''' to the congregation he served, he was the founder and former [[pastor]] of the [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; a founder of the [[Association of Life-Giving Churches]]; and was leader of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006. 

In November 2006, escort and [[masseur]] [[Mike Jones (personal trainer)|Mike Jones]] alleged that Haggard had paid him to engage in sex with him for three years and had also purchased and used [[crystal methamphetamine]].<ref name="Harris 1">{{cite news | first=Dan| last=Harris | coauthors= | title=Evangelical Leader Denies Accusation of Paying Former Gay Prostitute for Sex | date=November 3, 2006 | publisher= | url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2626067&page=1 | work =ABC News | accessdate = 2006-11-05}}</ref> A few days later Haggard resigned from all of his leadership positions. 

After the scandal was publicized, Haggard entered three weeks of intensive counseling, overseen by four ministers.  In February 2007, one of those ministers, Tim Ralph, said that Haggard "is completely [[heterosexual]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Haggard Pronounced <U+2018>Completely Heterosexual<U+2019> |date=2007-02-06 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |url= http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Haggard-Sex-Allegations.html?hp&ex=1170824400&en=e85aa315c9092d7e&ei=5094&partner=homepage | pages =1 |accessdate= 2007-02-06}}</ref> Ralph later said he meant that therapy "gave Ted the tools to help to embrace his heterosexual side." On June 1, 2010 Haggard announced that he intended to start a new church in Colorado Springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.850koa.com/cc-common/news/sections/newsarticle.html?feed=124975?feed=124975&article=7184492 |title=Ted Haggard starts new church|work=850 KOA|publisher=Clear Channel Communications| date = 2010-06-03}}</ref> In February 2011, Haggard [[Coming out|came out]] as bisexual.<ref name="CBS-GQ">{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20029939-10391698.html |publisher=CBS News |title=Ted Haggard Says He's Bisexual |date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
[[File:New Life Church in Colorado Springs 2.jpg|thumb|The main entrance of [[New Life Church, Colorado Springs|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs]]]]
Haggard was born in [[Indiana]].<ref>Sharlett, p.42.</ref> His father, J. M. Haggard, a practicing veterinarian in [[Yorktown, Indiana]], founded an international [[Charismatic movement|charismatic]] ministry, which was featured in a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] [[Middletown studies|Middletown]] documentary series.<ref>{{cite news | title=Sex, drugs and election fallout | publisher=[[Journal Gazette|The Journal Gazette]] | last=Castro | first=Anthony | date=2006-11-05 }}</ref> 

In second grade, one of his father's employees had sex with him, although Haggard never recognized it as [[child sexual abuse|abuse]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ted Haggard Admits Everything to Oprah|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94EnKUJQHI4|accessdate=14 July 2011}}</ref>

In 1972, at age sixteen, Haggard became a [[born-again Christian]] after hearing a sermon from evangelist [[Bill Bright]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] and becoming acquainted with the Christian apologetics of [[C.S. Lewis]].<ref>Ibid.</ref> As a co-editor of his high-school newspaper in 1974, he published remarkably frank articles which described services that were available to prevent and deal with increasingly prevalent pregnancies and [[sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s. These articles scandalized his small town and embroiled him in a free-press lawsuit.

Haggard describes feeling the call of God on his life after his first year in college, while he was in the kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to pastor. "I was totally surprised," Haggard wrote in ''The Life-Giving Church.''  "I . . . told the Lord I wanted to serve Him. But before I mentioned this to anyone, especially to my parents, I asked the Lord to assure me by using others to confirm His calling on my life. I felt as though He consented . . ." Within forty-eight hours, Haggard felt that he received four unsolicited confirmations: from a Sunday school teacher, a pastor, a friend, and from his father.<ref>Haggard, Ted: """The Life-Giving Church"" , page 27. Regal Books, 2001.</ref> Haggard subsequently attended [[Oral Roberts University]], a [[charismatic movement|Christian]] university in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], graduating in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title= Two ORU Alumni Recognized in Time Piece |work= ORU Excellence Magazine |publisher= ORU Alumni Foundation |date= Spring 2005 |url= http://alumniweb.oru.edu/excell/spring05/pages/department/lifelonglinks9.asp |accessdate= 2011-02-22 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070829082338/http://alumniweb.oru.edu/excell/spring05/pages/department/lifelonglinks9.asp |archivedate= 2007-08-29 }}</ref>

==Career as minister==
According to Haggard, in November 1984, when he was an associate pastor of [[Bethany World Prayer Center]] in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], his confidant and mentor [[Danny Ost]], a missionary to [[Mexico City]], had a vision of Haggard founding his church in [[Colorado Springs]]. Accordingly, Haggard moved to Colorado shortly afterwards, and founded [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]]. Initially, the 22 people who met in the basement of Haggard's house formed his church, which then grew to rented spaces in [[strip malls]].<ref>Sharlett, p.43-44.</ref> Haggard was unconventional in his approach to ministering to people. Through random acts of kindness, Haggard would sometimes skip the morning offering and surprise needy people, like returning military personnel and single parents, with financial blessings by asking the congregation to lay money at their feet as they stood in front of the congregation. After 22 years, New Life Church operated from a [[campus]] in northern Colorado Springs and had a congregation of 14,000.<ref name=Zoll-2006-11-10>{{cite news | last = Zoll | first = Rachel | title = Haggard scandal raises questions about 'superstar' pastors | publisher = Associated Press | date = 2006-11-10 | url = http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2006/11/10/haggard_scandal_raises_questions_about_superstar_pastors/?page=1 | accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}</ref> In 1993, during what Haggard describes as his "first prayer journey," he traveled with a group to Israel. They stood on the Mount of Olives, where Haggard claimed to have felt the Holy Spirit speak to him. "From that time until now," Haggard writes in ''The Life-Giving Church,'' "apostolic power has blessed me. My only problems are with me &mdash; not with the enemy, not with circumstances, not with people." <ref>Haggard, T: ''The Life Giving Church,'' page 36.  Regal Books, 2001</ref>

=== Scandal and removal from job ===
In November 2006, escort and [[masseur]] [[Mike Jones (personal trainer)|Mike Jones]] alleged that Haggard had paid Jones to engage in sex with him for three years and had also purchased and used [[crystal methamphetamine]].<ref name="Harris 1"/> Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard's true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying, "It made me angry that here<U+2019>s someone preaching against gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex." Jones made the allegations public in response to Haggard's political support for a [[Colorado Amendment 43]] on the November 7, 2006 Colorado ballot that would ban [[same-sex marriage]] in that state. Jones told [[ABC News]], "I had to expose the hypocrisy. He is in the position of influence of millions of followers, and he's preaching against gay marriage. But behind everybody's back [he's] doing what he's preached against."<ref name="Harris-ABC">{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2626067 | title=Haggard Admits Buying Meth | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=November 3, 2006 | first=Dan | last=Harris | accessdate=2006-11-06}}</ref> Jones hoped that his statements would sway voters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5115225,00.html | title=Accuser recounts trysts with 'Art' | publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]] | date=November 3, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2006-11-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061120180326/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5115225,00.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-20}}</ref>

Eventually, Haggard acknowledged almost all of the allegations against him, including using meth.<ref>"The resurrection of Pastor Ted," The Colorado Springs Independent, October 1, 2009, http://www.csindy.com/colorado/the-resurrection-of-pastor-ted/Content?oid=1450688</ref>  Haggard's immediate response was denial. He told a Denver television station, "I did not have a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver . . . I am steady with my wife. I'm faithful to my wife." Haggard also said, "I have never done drugs--ever. Not even in high school. I didn't smoke pot. I didn't do anything like that. I'm not a drug man. We're not a drinking family. I don't smoke cigarettes. I don't socially drink. We don't socially drink. We don't have wine in our house. We don't do that kind of thing." Cornered by his voicemail to Mike Jones requesting meth, Haggard told the press, "I bought it for myself but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it." Haggard claimed he bought the meth but threw it away.<ref>"Confronting a Scandal," The Colorado Springs Gazette, November 3, 2006, http://www.gazette.com/articles/haggard-10876-church-jones.html</ref>  Haggard claimed he had never met his accuser. Jones volunteered to take a [[polygraph]] test on a [[KHOW]] radio show hosted by [[Peter Boyles]], where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones's responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated [[lie|deception]]. The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones's stress and lack of eating or sleeping. Regardless, Haggard responded by saying, "We're so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did." Jones was not asked questions about drug use. Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying "I've made my point. He's the one who has discredited himself. He should admit it and move on."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4597552 | title=Haggard's accuser fails lie detector | work=[[The Denver Post]] | date=November 3, 2006 | first= Mike | last= McPhee | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> Haggard initially claimed he had never heard of his accuser and denied having ever done drugs and stated "I have not, I have never had a gay relationship with anybody." Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports.<ref>[http://wm.kusa.gannett.edgestreams.net/news/1162599872745-11-03-06-haggard-5p.wmv A look at the contradictions in the different statements Pastor Ted Haggard has made to 9NEWS. 9NEWS at 5 p.m. November 1, 2006.]</ref>  Despite his protestations, Haggard resigned from all of his leadership positions in religious organizations and was fired from his position as Senior Pastor of the church he founded.<ref name = "kktv-sex,drugs,writing">{{cite news | url=http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/5067391.html | title=Sex, drug allegations could affect Haggard's writing career | work=[[Associated Press]] | first= Ted | last= Haggard | accessdate = 2007-01-09}}</ref> 

Haggard later resigned as president of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]]. He went on administrative leave from his position as senior pastor of New Life Church, saying "I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership so that the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity. I hope to be able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date. In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance."<ref name="AP112">{{cite news | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5112770,00.html | title=Haggard steps down amid sex allegations |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]] | date=November 2, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2006-11-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061107224943/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5112770,00.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-11-07}}</ref> On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station [[KKTV]] that Haggard has admitted to some of the claims made by Jones.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.kktv.com/news/headlines/4557411.html | title=Church Leader Says Haggard Admits To Some Indiscretions|publisher=[[KKTV]] | date=2006-11-03 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> In an e-mail to [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote, "It is important for you to know that he [Haggard] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4597813 | title=Haggard admits buying meth | publisher=[[Denver Post]] | date=2006-12-06 |first=Mike | last=McPhee | coauthors=Eric Gorski | accessdate = 2007-01-01}}</ref>

Haggard admitted that he had purchased [[methamphetamine]] and received a [[massage]] from Jones, but he denied using the drugs or having sex with Jones. "I called him to buy some meth, but I threw it away. I bought it for myself but never used it", Haggard claimed in a television interview, and added, "I was tempted, but I never used it".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15536263/ | title=Haggard admits 'sexual immorality', apologizes | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=2006-11-05 | accessdate= 2007-01-01}}</ref> As it became apparent that some of the claims were true, some evangelical leaders such as [[Pat Robertson]] and [[Jerry Falwell]] sought to distance themselves and downplay Haggard's influence on religious conservatives and downplay the importance of the NAE. On his television show, ''[[The 700 Club]]'', Robertson said, "We're sad to see any evangelical leader fall" and also said the claim that the NAE represents thirty million people "just isn't true.... We can't get their financial data. I think it's because they have very little money and very little influence". During a CNN interview, Jerry Falwell went on record saying, "[Haggard] doesn't really lead the movement. He's president of an association that's very loose-knit... and no one has looked to them for leadership."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/03/AR2006110301617.html | title=Minister Admits to Buying Drugs and Massage | publisher=[[Washington Post]] | date=2006-11-04 | first=Alan | last=Cooperman | accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref> White House spokesman Tony Fratto sought to downplay Haggard's influence on the White House by saying that Haggard was only occasionally part of the weekly calls between evangelical leaders and the White House and had visited there only "a couple" of times.

[[James Dobson]] issued another public statement saying he was "heartsick" of learning about Haggard's admissions and that "the possibility that an illicit relationship has occurred is alarming to us and to millions of others." He also stated that "[Haggard] will continue to be my friend, even if the worst allegations prove accurate" but "nevertheless, sexual sin, whether homosexual or heterosexual, has serious consequences."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/03/haggard.allegations/ Church forces out Haggard for 'sexually immoral conduct'] 2006-11-03</ref> Dobson initially offered to help counsel Haggard, but later announced a change of mind. <U+201C>It is with great regret - and after much prayer and discussion with friends and family - that I have had to reconsider my involvement in the panel overseeing Ted<U+2019>s restoration,<U+201D> Dobson said in a statement. <U+201C>Emotionally and spiritually, I wanted to be of help - but the reality is I don<U+2019>t have the time to devote to such a critical responsibility.<U+201D> On November 3, 2006, Haggard resigned his leadership of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]].<ref name = "kktv-sex,drugs,writing"/> The National Association of Evangelicals posted a statement accepting his resignation. [[Leith Anderson]] was appointed as the new president on November 7, 2006. The board cited the bylaws of the [[megachurch]] and said his conduct compelled them to remove him from his job.<ref>[http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/HowHaggardWasFiredAndWhy.html How Ted Haggard Was Fired and Why: Minister<U+2019>s Own Rules Sealed His Fate] November 19, 2006</ref> The "Overseer Board of New Life Church" released a prepared statement on the afternoon of November 4, 2006 that stated: "Our investigation and Pastor Haggard's public statements have proven without a doubt that he has committed sexually immoral conduct."

=== Since leaving the church ===
{{Wikinews|Ted Haggard reaches financial settlement with New Life Church|date=February 11, 2007}}
In April 2007, the Haggard family moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to start the "restoration" process. They attended Phoenix First Assembly of God, whose pastor, Tommy Barnett, was on his counseling team. Haggard reached an agreement with New Life Church on a severance package that would pay him through 2007; one of the conditions was that he had to leave the Colorado Springs area.<ref>{{Cite document | url = http://www.9news.com/news/local/article.aspx?storyid=68347 | publisher = 9 News | place = Colorado, USA | title = Ted Haggard leaves Colorado for Phoenix | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Since the scandal broke, attendance at [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] has been down about 20 percent with financial support falling 10 percent.  As a consequence, the church has laid off 44 employees, representing about 12 percent of its workforce.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/041907dnnathaggard.2acf8d8.html | title = Disgraced minister Ted Haggard moving to Phoenix | publisher = Dallas Morning News }}</ref> On February 6, 2008, the new pastor at New Life Church, former home to Haggard, issued a press release announcing that Haggard had requested to leave the team created to "restore" him and that as Haggard's restoration is "incomplete," he is not welcome to return to vocational ministry at New Life.<ref>{{Cite document | url = http://www.coloradoconfidential.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3422 | publisher = Colorado Confidential | title = Ted Haggard Quits New Life 'Restoration Team' | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In August 2007, Haggard released a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while he and his wife attend classes at the [[University of Phoenix]], a university offering online degrees.  The former pastor also said that his family was moving into the Dream Center, a Phoenix-based halfway house that ministers to recovering convicts, drug addicts, prostitutes, etc. Haggard is pursuing a degree in counseling while his wife Gayle is studying psychology. After Haggard's request for donations, a member of Haggard's restoration team said he should have consulted with them before releasing a statement. News media pointed to his reported income: in 2006, he received $115,000 for the 10 months he worked and also received an $85,000 anniversary bonus shortly before the scandal broke; after the scandal broke, the board of trustees of [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] agreed to give him a $138,000 severance. Additionally, the Haggards have a home in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] that is valued at more than $600,000 and Haggard still receives royalties from books he has authored, though sales of those books have fallen off. Questions also surfaced about the tax-exempt group Haggard asked that donations be sent to on his behalf: Families With a Mission.  According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard.  But the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. A few days after Haggard's initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was "inappropriate" and that "Haggard was a little ahead of himself." They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.<ref>{{Cite document | url = http://www.gazette.com/articles/haggard-26460-church-new.html | title = Haggard appeals for financial help | publisher = Colorado Springs Gazette | date = August 25, 2007 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In June 2008, the severance deal with the New Life Church at an end, Haggard was "free to live where he wanted" and returned to his Colorado Springs home after living in [[Westwego, Louisiana]] since 2007. Also in June, an email surfaced in which Haggard admitted masturbating with Jones and taking drugs, as alleged in 2006. Kurt Serpe, who provided the email, said Haggard "craved sex, he was a [[sex addiction|sexaholic]]." In November 2008, Haggard said in guest sermons at an Illinois church that his actions had roots in sexual abuse by an adult when he was seven years old. He also agreed to appear in [[Alexandra Pelosi]]'s [[HBO]]  documentary about his sex scandal titled ''The Trials of Ted Haggard'', that premiered on HBO in January 2009. According to the documentary, Haggard has begun a new career selling insurance.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YepvM7qBanw The Trials of Ted Haggard Trailer] at [[YouTube]]</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1364306/ The Trials of Ted Haggard] at IMDb</ref><ref>Dan Harris and Lee Ferran, [http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=6235564&page=1 Exclusive: Ted Haggard Breaks His Silence], ''ABC News'', 12 November 2008</ref><ref name="Sexaholic">{{cite news | url=http://www.krdo.com/Global/story.asp?S=8556903&nav=menu552_1 | title=Former Pastor Ted Haggard Sexaholic, says Friend | publisher=[[KRDO-TV]] |date= June 25, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2008-07-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>The Associated Press, [http://www.365gay.com/news/defrocked-pastor-promoting-documentary-about-own-gay-sex-scandal/ "Defrocked pastor promoting documentary about own gay sex scandal"], "365 Gay: News", 18 December 2008</ref>

In January 2009, after the release of ''The Trials of Ted Haggard,'' Haggard and his wife, Gayle, appeared on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, Good Morning America'', and other national media programs to offer a public apology and confession for the issues that spurred his resignation in November 2006. The Haggard couple both appeared on the syndicated television show ''Divorce Court''. The program was scheduled for broadcast April 1<U+2013>2, 2009. On the program, Ted says he wanted his wife to divorce him after the scandal, saying that he thought he had become so "toxic" that divorce was best for Gayle and children. On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance of ''[[This Beautiful City (play)|This Beautiful City]]'', a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community, in New York. In August 2009, Haggard told '' Charisma'' magazine: "I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. I fell into sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented."  He also extols the benefits of qualified counselors: "I highly recommend qualified Christian counseling<U+2026> for anyone losing their fight with any kind of compulsive thoughts or behaviors. <U+2026> I believe our generation of believers is going to have to accept that it's not always lack of faith if we need counseling for assistance with integrity. If I had gone to counseling, I probably could have completely avoided my crisis."<ref name= "charismamag.com">{{Cite web | url = http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/features/2009/august/22523-ted-and-gayle-haggard | contribution = Ted and Gayle Haggard | first = J Lee | last = Grady | title = Charisma Magazine | date = August 2009 | accessdate= 2009-08-03 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Since the "repentance broadcasts," Haggard and his wife have travelled to churches and appeared on radio and television broadcasts. They have also begun to have former church members and friends come to their home for "healing meetings," in which Haggard apologizes, answers any questions, and discusses "how the Gospel can inform our responses to others who violate biblical standards." The couple has been writing, traveling, and speaking about the events of the past several years. In November 2009, Haggard began holding prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs basement.  One hundred ten people attended the first prayer meeting.<ref>{{Cite web | contribution = Haggard starting new church at his Springs home | title = The Colorado Springs Gazette | date = November 4, 2009 | url = http://www.gazette.com/articles/haggard-65454-ted-church.html | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Other allegations surface ===
On January 23, 2009, less than one week before ''The Trials of Ted Haggard'' was released on HBO, officials from Haggard's former church announced that a young male church member had come forward in 2006 and that there was an "overwhelming pool of evidence [of an] inappropriate, consensual sexual relationship [that] went on for a long period of time [with Haggard] ... it wasn't a one-time act." Haggard's successor, [[Brady Boyd]], said the church reached a six figure settlement with the man, who was in his early 20s at the time.<ref name="Newliferesponse">{{cite news | url=http://www.krdo.com/Global/story.asp?S=9729019 | title=New Life Addresses NEWSCHANNEL 13 Investigation| publisher=[[KRDO-TV]] |year= Jan 25, 2009 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2009-02-17}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to the man, the contact was "not consensual".<ref name="Newliferesponse"/> Later reports indicated that the relationship did not involve physical contact, but that on one occasion Haggard masturbated in front of the young man, who was 22 years old at the time.<ref>[http://ministrytodaymag.com/index.php/ministry-news/65-news-main/18250-reopening-old-wounds-for-new-life Reopening Old Wounds for New Life] | Ministry Today Magazine | accessdate = 2009-06-25</ref> The man, Grant Haas, added that New Life Church paid him $179,000 to cover his counseling to help recover from the situation, and pay college tuition.<ref>"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,483405,00.html Former Church Member: Haggard Performed Sex Act]<U+201D>, Fox News/Associated Press, January 27, 2009.</ref> Haggard openly admitted to the second, albeit nonsexual relationship with Haas on [[CNN]] and other media, and when asked if he had had additional gay relationships that have been unreported, Haggard did not provide a direct answer.<ref>"[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/01/29/lkl.ted.haggard/ Disgraced pastor Haggard admits second relationship with man]<U+201D>, CNN-TV Larry King, January 29, 2009</ref>  In the aftermath of both the allegations of New Life paying financial penalties to Haas and the documentary on Haggard's struggles being released, attendance and giving dropped substantially at New Life Church leading to a second round of layoffs in February.<ref>[http://www.kktv.com/home/headlines/6302907.html  New Life Church Layoffs: Church hit by sex scandal cutting staff: The megachurch founded by evangelist Ted Haggard has laid off 44 people amid falling income and attendance] March 4, 2007</ref>

===Return to the pulpit in Colorado Springs===
In October 2009,  the ''[[Colorado Springs Independent]]'' published the first extensive interview  with Haggard to appear in the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2<U+00BD> hour interview, the former Pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideation and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. "Back in the old days," said Haggard, "when somebody would get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which is one of the reasons why we needed to come home. Because I needed to finish this story from here."  

On November 4, Haggard posted a message on his Twitter account announcing his intent to begin public prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs home.

On June 6, 2010 the first meeting of the St. James Church occurred with Haggard as the Pastor in [[Colorado Springs]], [[Colorado]] at his home.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jtYgjRZN25d_quoTDTzF-d4c5AzgD9G3GVS80 "Ted Haggard to start new church in Colo.

==Beliefs==
Haggard has stated he believes in what is known as the [[Third Wave of the Holy Spirit]] and subscribes to the concept referred to as the [[Five-fold ministry]]&nbsp;&ndash; beliefs often associated with the [[charismatic movement]]. He has stated that he believes that there is one, all-knowing God, and that humans were created to be with him. Haggard has often stated that he is a part of the "non-fanatical" Charismatic movement which embraces both the mind and heart together as gifts from God in following Christ.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==="Life-Giving Church"===
Haggard developed a concept he called "The Life-Giving Church" which amounted to his ministry praxis.  He believed that churches and their members either lived "in the Tree of Life" or "in the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians.  For instance, Haggard proposed, two women can stand outside an abortion clinic with protest signs.  The "tree of life" protestor is there because she loves the unborn and has compassion for the mother and father. The "tree of knowledge of good and evil" protestor has come because she believes abortion is evil and must be stopped.  "One way we can tell which tree we are living in," writes Haggard, "is our response to sin<U+2026> one of the greatest marks of bearing His [Christ's] character is our response to someone else's sin.  If we handle others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom.  But if we handle others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die."  Christians who live in the "tree of life," writes Haggard, "grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness."  Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display "frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death."<ref name= "Haggard, Ted 2001">Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church,'' pp. 51<U+2013>61 Regal Books, 2001.</ref>

In ''The Life-Giving Church'', Haggard sets forth bylaws he initiated which are meant to help other churches with forming their own bylaws.  From the Statement of Faith, to the replacement of a new pastor, the entire set of bylaws is listed in the back of this book. A significant part of the bylaws is the universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became. There were also provisions for numbers of children in a family and years of pastoral experience. "I was there longer than a lot of the other people but, if you were a youth pastor there, at five years you were making what I was making at five years."<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', pp. 220<U+2013>65, Regal Books, 2001.</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">Forman, Bill, ''The Resurrection of Pastor Ted'', Colorado Springs Independent, October 1, 2009</ref>

A significant part of Haggard's ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model. He wrote of the importance of this type of leadership in the book, ''The Life-Giving Church.'' Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in "cumbersome systems" in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its "brightest and best future leaders".<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''The Life-Giving Church'', p. 48, Regal Books, 2001.</ref> Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate out the best ideas (even to the point of disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired<ref name="ReferenceA"/> dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. This style of leadership is best understood as servant leadership.  In Ted's book, ''Primary Purpose'', he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership he taught is the opposite. In a visual representation, Ted uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept.  The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This "Phillippians 2 Attitude" comes from the scripture that states, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others."<ref>Haggard, Ted, ''Primary Purpose,'' pp. 128<U+2013>31. Creation House, 1995.</ref>  "I took a free-market approach to that and just wanted to empower people to minister whatever was in their hearts."<ref name = "ReferenceA" /> Some of the best known results of this model are the Mill (the largest college ministry in America), the Desperation Band and Desperation interns, the Furnace and World Prayer Center, 24/7 leadership training and New Life Groups, a unique brand of free-market small groups as well as many others.<ref>New Life Groups Summer 2006, New Life Groups Department, New Life Church, 2006</ref> As an example of his coaching of young leaders, John Bolin, in the book he wrote with Haggard says, "He (Haggard) talked about communicating with people by improving my posture, poise, and delivery. He painstakingly coached me to stand up tall, to speak with confidence, to look people in the eye, and to articulate with concise clarity<U+2026> he knew I wouldn't be effective<U+2026> unless I understood the principle of communication and connection by presenting myself well".<ref>Haggard, Ted, Bolin, John, ''Confident Parents, Exceptional Teens'', pp. 80<U+2013>1. Zondervan Publishing House, 1999</ref> While some detractors,{{Who|date=August 2009}} post-crisis, have criticized Haggard's leadership style as creating "silos," there is little doubt that his style led to the growth of New Life, at its peak, to 14,000 members.<ref>{{Cite document | url = http://www.californiawomen.org/gayle-haggard/ | title = The Women's Conference | contribution = Gayle Haggard | date = 15 September 2009 | publisher = California Women | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

=== Politics ===
In 2005, Haggard was listed by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as one of the top 25 most influential evangelicals in America.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/press_releases/article/0,8599,1022576,00.html TIME Names the 25 Most Influential EVANGELICALS in America] TIME</ref> Haggard was a firm supporter of former US President [[George W. Bush]], and is sometimes credited with rallying [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] behind Bush during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3992067.stm | title=State Of The Union: The Evangelical vote | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date= 9 November 2004 | first=Tim | last=Egan | accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> Author [[Jeff Sharlet]] reported in 2005 that Haggard "talks to<U+2026> Bush or his advisers every Monday" and stated at that time that "no pastor in America holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism."<ref>Sharlet, p.42,43.</ref> 

Haggard has stated that fighting [[global warming]] is an important issue, a divisive issue among Evangelical leaders. Though he personally supported the [[Evangelical Climate Initiative]], the NAE did not adopt a position.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/national/08warm.html?adxnnl=1&fta=y&adxnnlx=1162585363-sd3OwjLLBFb1aVJ0qwn8tg | title=Evangelical Leaders Join Global Warming Initiative | publisher=[[New York Times]] | date= February 8, 2006 | first= Laurie | last= Goodstein | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref>

=== Teachings on homosexuality ===

In 2006, Haggard and his church supported "Amendment 43" to the Colorado Constitution.<ref><U+201C>Pastor takes leave amid allegations of gay sex,<U+201D> The Denver Post, November 3, 2006, http://www.denverpost.com/ci_4588998</ref> It provided, "Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state."<ref>Colorado Secretary of State, Amendment 43, February 17, 2006, http://www.elections.colorado.gov/Content/Documents/Initiatives/Title%20Board%20Filings/Final%20Text%2083.pdf</ref> Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being between a man and a woman, Haggard and other gay rights opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the [[Colorado Supreme Court]] would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional.  In the movie'' [[Jesus Camp]]'', Haggard says, "we don't have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity. It<U+2019>s written in the Bible."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003365311_jesuscamp08.html |title=Pastor will shut down controversial kids camp|accessdate=2006-11-10|date=2006-11-08|work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>  Although Haggard opposes [[same-sex marriage]], he has suggested that there should be [[civil union]]s for homosexual couples.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=34416 |title= Ted Haggard is OK with gay marriage but not really |date= January 9, 2009 |accessdate= 2010-10-28 |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first=Joe |last=Garofoli}}</ref>

Under Haggard's leadership, the NAE released "For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility" in late 2004, "a document urging engagement in traditional [[culture war]] issues such as [[abortion]] and [[gay marriage]] but also [[poverty]], [[education]], [[taxes]], [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[immigration]]." The NAE has stated that "homosexual activity, like adulterous relationships, is clearly condemned in the Scriptures."

== Television and movie appearances ==
Haggard has appeared on several broadcast network programs, including ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' and ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]''. He also appears in the documentary ''[[Jesus Camp]]'',<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_4340346| title=Fire, brimstone around "Jesus" film | publisher=[[Denver Post]] | date= 2006-09-15| first=Eric | last=Gorski | accessdate = 2006-11-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jesuscampthemovie.com/haggard_response.html JESUS CAMP responds to Ted Haggard]</ref> the [[History Channel]] documentary ''The Antichrist'', the documentary ''[[Constantine's Sword (film)|Constantine's Sword]]'', as well as the HBO documentary ''[[Friends of God (film)|Friends of God]]: A Road Trip with [[Alexandra Pelosi]]''. In 2009, Pelosi made ''The Trials of Ted Haggard'', a film which documented Haggard's life in exile after the scandal, which was aired on HBO. To date, this documentary has been shown over forty times on HBO. ''Trials'' has received critical acclaim.

In early 2006, evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] interviewed Haggard as part of a British television documentary entitled ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]''.<ref>[[The Root of All Evil?]] documentary by Richard Dawkins</ref> During this interview, Dawkins started by comparing Haggard's church service to the Nuremberg Rallies before then speaking about contradictions between the cumulative knowledge produced by science, and a literal interpretation of the Bible (particularly its account of creation). In response, Haggard claimed to "fully embrace the scientific method." Haggard then stated that the conclusions of that method regarding the [[age of the earth]] and [[evolution]] were only the result of "some of the views that are accepted in some portions of the scientific community." When Dawkins pointed out Haggard's misconception of the theory of evolution (for instance Haggard's notion that complex organs such as the eye spontaneously manifested), Haggard suggested that Dawkins should be less arrogant about his learning, saying that he himself isn't arrogant because he "knows so much more".

As Dawkins and his film crew were packing up to leave, there was a brief altercation in the church parking lot. According to Dawkins, Haggard ordered Dawkins's crew off his land with the words "You called my children animals" and threatened legal action and confiscation of their recording equipment. Later, Dawkins speculated that Haggard actually believed that Dawkins had implied that his children were animals, something Dawkins reflected he agrees with, given [[common descent]].

==Personal life==
In 1978, Haggard married Gayle Alcorn.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4191/is_20021222/ai_n10013015/ | title=Reality stems from pastor's Vision / Charismatic preachers have come | publisher=[[Colorado Springs Gazette]] | date= December 22, 2002| first=Eric | last=Gorski | accessdate = 2006-11-03}}</ref> The couple has five children: Christy (1981), Marcus (1983) (founder and former pastor of [[Boulder Street Church]], Colorado Springs<ref>{{cite news
