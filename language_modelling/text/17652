|quote=It was quite funny, really. I knew the prince played water polo and that he was selected to represent at the 2002 Commonwealth Championships in Manchester. So when I told him what I did, he smiled and bowed. I gave him a book [Water Warriors] and some Australian water polo cossies. He said: 'Oh, bathers' and then someone told him they were also known as budgie smugglers. The prince laughed and from then on he wanted to know all about me, the national team, the Olympics. He didn't want to talk about himself at all.
