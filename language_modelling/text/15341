'''Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap A/S''', trading internationally as '''West Norway Airlines''', was a [[airline]] based in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], which operated from 1946 to 1957. The company operated almost entirely a fleet of [[seaplane]]s out of its base at [[Bergen Airport, Sandviken]]. From 1951 it operated scheduled services along the [[Western Norway|West Coast]] as summer-only services.

The airline started off as a [[general aviation]] operator, mostly operating [[Republic RC-3 Seabee]]s. The airline took over the Bergen to [[Trondheim]] route in 1951, at which time it also bought two [[Short Sealand]]s. The route and intermediate stops in [[<U+00C5>lesund]], [[Molde]] and [[Kristiansund]]. The following year the airline also started flying from [[Stavanger]] via [[Haugesund]] to Bergen. [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]] opened in 1955, displacing the need for seaplanes on some of the routes. However, the airline flew the Bergen to Stavanger route with a wheeled [[de Havilland Heron]]. The Haugesund service closed in 1956 and the northern route closed the following year in anticipation of the opening of [[<U+00C5>lesund Airport, Vigra]].

==History==
The airline was established in Bergen in 1946.<ref name=kristiansen>{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Nedstovet-flyhistorie-2285254.html |title=Nedst<U+00F8>vet flyhistorie |last=Kristiansen |first=Tor |date=10 January 2005 |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The first aircraft were operational in 1948,<ref name=seabee /> consisting of three three-passenger Republic RC-3 Seabees and a one-passenger [[Luscombe 8|Luscombe 8A Silvaire]]. The airline was initially engaged in various general aviation activities. An important task was [[air ambulance]] services. However, the airline never signed a fixed contract with the health authorities and had to get every trip refunded on a case for case basis form the [[National Insurance Service|National Insurance Administration]].<ref name=kristiansen />

The West Coast of Norway had only one land airport during until 1955, [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]]. Flights along the coast and to the capital were therefore limited to seaplanes. [[Norwegian Air Lines]] resumed its pre<U+2013>[[Second World War]] route from Stavanger via [[Haugesund Airport, Storesundsskj<U+00E6>r]] to [[Bergen Airport, Hjellestad]] in 1946, using [[Junkers Ju 52]] seaplanes.<ref name=r14>Reitan: 14</ref> From 1948 they extended the service north from Bergen, calling at [[<U+00C5>lesund Airport, S<U+00F8>rneset]]; Kristiansund and [[Trondheim Airport, Hommelvik]].<ref name=oh8>Olsen-Hagen: 8</ref> The airline pulled out of these routes after the 1949 summer season.<ref name=r14 /><ref name=oh8 />

West Norway Airlines took over the Bergen to Trondheim route, which commenced on 14 May 1951. They kept using the former aerodromes, although the re-established [[Trondheim Airport, Jonsvatnet]] as a reserve airport for Trondheim.<ref name=v105>Vik: 105</ref> The Seabees soon proved to be too small and instead bought an eight-passenger Short Sealands were bought.<ref name=h293 /><ref name=h13>Hjelle: 13</ref> [[Wider<U+00F8>e]] took over the southern portion, but was not able to make money on it and terminated operations after the first summer.<ref name=r14 /> West Norway Airlines therefor took over also this segment from 1952.<ref name=r15>Reitan: 15</ref> For this a second Sealand was delivered.<ref name=h293 />

With the opening of Bergen Airport, Flesland in 1955, West Norway Airlines commenced a service from Bergen to Stavanger. They bought a land [[Norsk Flyindustri Finnmark 5A]] in 1955 for this use, with a capacity for three passengers.<ref>Hagby: 59</ref> It soon proved too small and the following season the airline acquired a new de Havilland Heron aircraft.<ref name=h36>Hagby: 36</ref>

The airline was involved in the attempts to establish a regional airport in [[Flor<U+00F8>]]. Plans were launched in the mid-1950s that a {{convert|800|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway be built which would allow West Norway Airlines to connect to Bergen with a [[Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avinor.no/lufthavn/forde/omoss/75_Lufthavnens+historie |title=Lufthavnens historie |publisher=[[Avinor]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 October 2012 |archivedate=3 October 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6B8cU4nIy |deadurl=no}}</ref> The government approved the plans in 1956 and construction of a {{convert|400|m|sp=us|adj=on}} runway commenced later that year. However, the authorities deemed the Twin Pioneer unsuitable for winter operations and both these plans and the airport construction fell flat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrk.no/sf/leksikon/index.php/Flysamband_og_lufthamna_i_Flor%C3%B8 |title=Flysamband og lufthamna i Flor<U+00F8> |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=Fylkesleksikon |language=Norwegian |accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>

Similar plans were launched in <U+00C5>lesund. Initially [[Aukra Airport, Gossen]] was selected as [[M<U+00F8>re og Romsdal]]'s central airport, but West Norway Airlines instead proposed building a short runway on the island of [[Vigra (island)|Vigra]] and operate to it using the Twin Pioneer. Although West Norway Airlines would never receive concessions to operate land planes from <U+00C5>lesund, the site was ultimately selected for <U+00C5>lesund Airport, Vigra, when opened in 1958.<ref>Hjelle: 14</ref>

The route to Haguesund continued until 29 September 1956. From then the local authorities stated that they would rather than the subsidies be used to build a land airport than retain sea services.<ref name=r15 /> [[Braathens SAFE]] was selected as the operator of the coastal routes from <U+00C5>lesund instead of West Norway Airlines. Following the icing incident leading to the crash of [[Braathens SAFE Flight 253]] in 1956, the aviation authorities banned winter operations of the Herons. Thus newer aircraft were needed. Braathens SAFE offered to cross-subsidize the coastal route Bergen<U+2013><U+00C5>lesund<U+2013>Trondheim in exchange for receiving a monopoly on the profitable Oslo route.<ref>Tjomsland & Wilsberg: 112</ref> Left without concessions, the airline filed for bankruptcy at the end of the 1957 season.<ref name=kristiansen />
