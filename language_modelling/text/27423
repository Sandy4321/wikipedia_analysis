'''Breast augmentation''' denotes surgical and non-surgical [[mammoplasty]] procedures to alter and correct the size, form, and feel of a woman<U+2019>s breasts. The surgical approach features global augmentation with a [[breast implant]] prosthesis and corrections with transplanted [[TRAM flap|skin flaps]]. The non-surgical approach features breast augmentation and corrections by contouring the recipient site with grafts of autologous [[adipocyte|fat tissue]]. Each approach corrects post<U+2013>[[mastectomy]] defects in [[breast reconstruction]]; [[Congenital defect|congenital]] chest wall deformities; and effects the aesthetic enhancement of the bust. In surgical practice, the breast [[Tissue expansion|tissue expander]] implant is a temporary breast-implant device used in staged breast reconstruction. In non-surgical practice, some breast surgery fat graft corrections feature pre-procedure external tissue expansion of the recipient site.


==Surgical breast augmentation==
===Breast implants===
To [[Breast reconstruction|recreate]] and enhance the size, form, and feel of a woman<U+2019>s [[breast]]s, '''breast implant devices''' come in three types: '''saline implants''' filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]], '''silicone implants''' filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel, and '''alternative-composition implants''', filled with miscellaneous fillers <U+2014> [[soy|soy oil]], [[String breast implant|polypropylene string]], et cetera <U+2014> that are no longer manufactured.

[[Image:Saline-filled breast implants.jpeg|thumb|[[saline (medicine)|Saline]]-filled breast implant devices.]]
'''Saline implants'''
<br> Breast implants filled with saline solution (salt water) of biological concentration were first manufactured in 1964, in France, and introduced for medical use in 1964, the surgico<U+2013>technical goals were emplacement via shorter incisions.<ref name="Arion1965">{{cite journal|author=Arion HG|title=Retromammary Prosthesis |journal=C R Societ<U+00E9> Fran<U+00E7>aise de Gyn<U+00E9>cologie | year=1965|volume=5}}</ref> Unlike the predecessor models, modern saline breast have shells made of [[room-temperature vulcanization|room-temperature vulcanized]] ([[RTV]]) [[elastomer]] [[silicone]]. During the surgery, the empty implants are filled with saline solution, after emplacement to the implant pocket. Because the implants are inserted empty, the resultant surgical-incision [[scar]] will be smaller than the scar produced by the long-incision IMF (inframammary fold) approach used for inserting the comparatively voluminous, pre-filled silicone gel breast implants.<ref name="Stevens">{{cite journal|author=Stevens WG, Hirsch EM, Stoker DA, Cohen R.|title=In vivo Deflation of Pre-filled Saline Breast Implants | journal=Plastic Reconstruction Surgery | year=2006|pages=347<U+2013>349| volume=118|issue=2|pmid=16874200|doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000227674.65284.80}}</ref> Although the silicone breast implant has superior aesthetic characteristics, the saline implant, if correctly emplaced, produces good-to-excellent results might results, despite a tendency to cause readily noticeable cosmetic problems, such as rippling and wrinkling. In patients with more breast tissue, for whom submuscular implant placement is the recommended surgical technique, saline breast implants can afford an aesthetic appearance much like that afforded by the silicone-gel breast implant.

[[Image:Silicone gel-filled breast implants.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Silicone]]-gel breast implant devices.]]
'''Silicone gel implants'''
<br>Silicone gel breast implants are described in five implant device generations, defined by the manufacturing techniques meant to improve its physical and aesthetic realism, as if a natural [[breast]]. The silicone breast implant was invented in 1961 by the American [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeons]] Thomas Cronin and Frank Gerow, and the [[Dow Corning Corporation]]; and the first augmentation [[mammoplasty]] was performed in 1962, using the silicone gel '''Cronin<U+2013>Gerow Implant, prosthesis model 1963'''.

'''First generation''' (1960s) <U+2014> The outcomes of [[Mammoplasty|mammoplastic]] praxis and aesthetic surgery were much improved by the introduction of the Cronin<U+2013>Gerow Implant (prosthesis model 1963), because it was an anatomically shaped (contoured) breast implant device <U+2014> a tear-drop silicone rubber envelope filled with viscous silicone-gel <U+2014> that better resembled a natural breast. To reduce the rotation of the emplaced implant device, the Cronin<U+2013>Gerow Implant featured a fastener-patch, of Dacron ([[Polyethylene terephthalate]]), affixed to the back of the device shell.<ref name=Cronin_1963>{{cite journal | author = Cronin TD, Gerow FJ | title = Augmentation Mammaplasty: A New <U+201C>natural feel<U+201D> Prosthesis | journal = Excerpta Medica International Congress Series | year = 1963 | volume = 66 | pages = 41 | url= }}</ref>

'''Second generation''' (1970s) <U+2014> The notable design and technological improvements to the breast implant included greater physical verisimilitude, an anti-inflammatory coating, and a double-cavity construction. The softer, more life-like breast implants, because of the thinner device shells and thinner (low-cohesion) silicone-gel filler, but had greater incidences of shell rupture and filler leakage through an intact implant-device shell, and of complications (e.g. [[capsular contracture]]). In the early 1990s, faulty, Second-generation silicone-gel breast implants were the subjects of U.S. government [[Class action|class action lawsuits]] against the [[Dow Corning Corporation]], and other [[breast implant|breast implant device]] manufacturers.

The '''[[polyurethane]] foam coating''' for the implant shell reduced incidences of [[capsular contracture]] by causing an [[Inflammation|inflammatory reaction]] that impeded the formation of a [[scar]] capsule <U+2014> fibrous [[collagen]] tissue <U+2014> around the breast implant. Yet coated models were temporarily disallowed until the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined whether or not there existed a health risk from the chemical [[TDA|2,4-toluenediamine]] (TDA), a [[carcinogenic]] by-product of the chemical breakdown of the implant<U+2019>s polyurethane foam coating; after investigating, the FDA re-authorized their plastic surgery use in the U.S.<!--  --><ref name="Luu11998">{{cite journal | author=Luu HM, Hutter JC, Bushar HF | title=A Physiologically based Pharmacokinetic Model for 2,4-toluenediamine Leached from Polyurethane foam-covered Breast Implants | journal=Environ Health Perspect | year=1998 | pages=393<U+2013>400 | volume=106 | issue=7 | pmid=9637796 |url=http://www.ehponline.org/members/1998/106p393-400luu/luu-full.html | doi=10.2307/3434066 | pmc=1533137 | jstor=3434066 | publisher=Environmental Health Perspectives, Vol. 106, No. 7}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Hester TR Jr, Tebbetts JB, Maxwell GP | title=The Polyurethane-covered Mammary Prosthesis: Facts and Fiction (II): A Look Back and a <U+201C>peek<U+201D> Ahead | journal=Clinical Plastic Surgery | year=2001 | pages=579<U+2013>586 | volume=28 | issue=3 | pmid=11471963}}</ref>

The '''double lumen''' design <U+2014> a silicone implant within a saline implant <U+2014> meant to provide the physical verisimilitude and aesthetic benefits of silicone-gel (inner lumen) enclosed in saline solution (outer lumen). The volume (size) of the double-cavity breast implant device was post-operatively adjustable, yet the more complex design had a device-failure rate greater than that of single-lumen implant devices. A modern version of the double lumen design is the <U+201C>Becker Expandable<U+201D> (1984) implant, which is used primarily as a recipient site [[Tissue expansion|tissue expander]] in [[Reconstructive surgery|breast reconstruction]].

'''Third generation''' and '''Fourth generation''' (1980s) <U+2014> Introduced in mid-decade, elastomer-coated device shells, increased-cohesion gel filler, and model variety, were the technological advances in manufacturing silicone breast implants. The [[elastomer]] silicone coating of the implant device shell, and an increased-cohesion (thicker) filler gel, decreased the incidence of filler leakage. The manufacturers then introduced breast implants in anatomic (natural) and shaped (round, contoured) design varieties, available with either a smooth or a textured surface to control the movement of the emplaced implant device.

'''Fifth generation''' (1990s) <U+2014> Introduced in mid-decade, the silicone breast implant is of semi-solid gel that mostly eliminates filler leakage (silicone migration), thus has reported low incidence rates of [[capsular contracture]] and of device-shell rupture.<ref name="Brown2005">{{cite journal | author=Brown MH, Shenker R, Silver SA | title=Cohesive Silicone Gel Breast Implants in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2005 | pages=768<U+2013>779; discussion 780<U+2013>1 | volume=116 | issue=3 | pmid=16141814 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000176259.66948.e7}}</ref><!--  --><ref name="Fruhstorfer2004">{{cite journal | author=Fruhstorfer BH, Hodgson EL, Malata CM | title=Early Experience with Anatomical Soft Cohesive Silicone gel Prosthesis in Cosmetic and Reconstructive Breast Implant Surgery | journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery | year=2004 | pages=536<U+2013>542 | volume=53 | issue=6 | pmid=15602249 | doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000134508.43550.6f}}</ref><!--  --><ref name="Heden2001">{{cite journal | author=Heden P, Jernbeck J, Hober M | title=Breast Augmentation with Anatomical Cohesive gel Implants: The World<U+2019>s Largest Current Experience | journal=Clinical Plastic Surgery | year=2001 | pages=531<U+2013>552 | volume=28 | issue=3 | pmid=11471959}}</ref>

===Implants and breast feeding===
[[File:Breast.svg|thumb|The mammary gland: <br>Legend: <br>1. [[Chest wall]] <br>2. [[Pectoralis muscle]]s <br>3. [[Lobules]] <br>4. [[Nipple]] <br>5. [[Areola]] <br>6. [[Lactiferous duct|Duct]] <br>7. [[Adipose tissue|Fatty tissue]] <br>8. [[Human skin|Skin]]]]

Women with breast implants are able to [[Breast|breast-feed]] their infants, yet breast implant devices can cause functional breast-feeding difficulties, because some [[mammoplasty]] procedures <U+2014> especially periareolar incisions and subglandular emplacement <U+2014> are associated with greater incidences of impeded breast-feeding. If she wishes to ensure maximal breast-feeding functionality post-surgery, the child-bearing-age woman seeking breast implants discusses with her [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] the best implantation procedure that will least damage her milk ducts and nipple nerves to allow nursing her infant.<ref>[http://www.llli.org/NB/NBsurgery.html Breastfeeding after Breast Surgery], La Leche League, contains numerous references.</ref><ref>[http://www.llli.org/cbi/bibimplant.html Breastfeeding and Breast Implants], Selected Bibliography April 2003, LLLI Center for Breastfeeding Information</ref><ref name="slate">[http://www.slate.com/id/2238096/ Inorganic Milk: Can Kendra Wilkinson breast-feed her baby even though she has implants?], Christopher Beam, [[Slate.com]], December 11, 2009</ref>

[[File:Breastfeeding01.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The mammary gland: <br>Breast-feeding an infant.]]

The principal infant-health concerns are leakage of breast-implant filler to the [[Breast|breast milk]], and if the filler is dangerous to the nursing infant. Breast implant device fillers are biologically inert <U+2014> saline filler is salt water, and silicone filler is [[Digestion|indigestible]] <U+2014> each substance is chemically neutral and environmentally common.<ref>Berlin, C. M. Silicone breast implants and breast-feeding. Pediatrics 1994; 94:546-49.</ref><ref name="berlin1996">[http://www.llli.org/ba/Feb96.html Silicone Breast Implants and Breastfeeding], Cheston M. Berlin, Jr. MD, Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, from Breastfeeding Abstracts, February 1996, Volume 15, Number 3, pp. 17-18.</ref> In the early 1990s, at the beginning of the silicone breast-implant sickness occurances, small-scale, non-random studies indicated possible breast-feeding complications from silicone implants; yet no study reported device<U+2013>disease causality.<ref name="berlin1996" />

Functional breast-feeding difficulies arise if the surgeon cut the milk ducts or the major nerves, or if the milk glands were otherwise damaged. Milk duct and nerve damage are more common to the periareolar incision implantation procedure, which cuts tissue near the nipple, whereas other incisions <U+2014> inframammary, TABA, transaxillary, TUBA <U+2014> avoid the nipple tissue.<ref name="slate"/> To maximally preserve breast-feeding functionality, the periareolar incisions can be effected to reduce damage to the milk ducts and major nerves. The milk glands are most affected by subglandular (over-the-muscle) implants, and by large-sized breast implants, which pinch the gland and impede breast milk flow. Submuscular implants and small-sized implants cause fewer breast-function problems; nonetheless, women have successfully breast-fed after undergoing augmentation mammoplasty with periareolar incisions and subglandular implant placement.<ref name="slate"/>

===Implants and mammography===
[[Image:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|right|185px|Mammographs: Normal breast (left) and cancerous breast (right).]]
The presence of [[radiology|radiologically]] opaque breast implants might interfere with the radiographic sensitivity of the [[mammograph]]. In which case, an Eklund view mammogram is required, wherein the breast implant is manually displaced against the chest wall and the breast is pulled forward, so that the mammograph can visualize the internal tissues, nonetheless, approximately one-third (1/3) of the breast tissue remains inadequately visualized, resulting in an increased incidence of false-negative mammograms.<ref name="Handel1992">{{cite journal | author=Handel, N., Silverstein, M.

==Surgical procedures==
===Indications===
[[Image:Mastectomie 02.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Breast augmentation: A primary reconstruction mammoplasty patient.]]

An augmenation [[mammoplasty]] for emplacing [[breast implant|breast implants]] has three purposes:

* '''primary reconstruction''' <U+2014> to replace breast tissues damaged by trauma (blunt, penetrating), disease ([[breast cancer]]), or failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast|tuberous breast deformity]]).

* '''revision and reconstruction''' <U+2014> to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.

* '''primary augmentation''' <U+2014> to aesthetically augment the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

The [[operating room]] (OR) time of post<U+2013>[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]], and of breast augmentation surgery is determined by the procedure employed, the type of incisions, the breast implant (type and materials), and the pectoral locale of the implant pocket.

===Incision types===
Breast implant device emplacement is performed with five types of surgical incisions:

* '''Inframammary''' <U+2014> an incision made below the breast, in the [[infra-mammary fold]] (IMF), which affords maximal access for precise dissection and emplacement of the breast implant devices. It is the preferred surgical technique for emplacing silicone-gel implants, because of the longer incisions required; yet, IMF implantation can produce thicker, slightly more visible surgical scars.

* '''Periareolar''' <U+2014> an incision made along the [[areola|areolar]] periphery (border), which provides an optimal approach when adjustments to the IMF position are required, or when a [[mastopexy]] (breast lift) is included to the primary mammoplasty procedure. In the periareolar emplacement method, the incision is around the medial-half (inferior half) of the areola<U+2019>s circumference. Silicone-gel implants can be difficult to emplace with this incision, because of the short, five-centimetre length (~ 5.0 cm.) of the required access-incision. Aesthetically, because the scars are at the areola<U+2019>s border, they usually are less visible than the IMF-incision scars of women with light-pigment areolae. Furthermore, periareolar implantation produces a greater incidence of [[capsular contracture]], severs the [[milk duct]]s and the [[Nerve|nerves]] to the nipple, thus causes the most post-operative functional problems, e.g. impeded [[breast feeding]].

* '''Transaxillary''' <U+2014> an incision made to the axilla (armpit), from which the dissection tunnels medially, thus allows emplacing the implants without producing visible scars upon the breast proper; yet is likelier to produce inferior asymmetry of the implant-device position. Therefore, surgical revision of transaxillary emplaced breast implants usually requires either an IMF incision or a periareolar incision. Transaxillary emplacement can be performed bluntly or with an [[endoscope]] (illuminated video microcamera).

* '''Transumbilical''' <U+2014> a trans-umbilical breast augmentation (TUBA) is a less common implant-device insertion technique wherein the incision is at the [[navel]], and the dissection tunnels superiorly. This surgical approach enables emplacing the breast implants without producing visible scars upon the breast; but it makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly <U+2014> without the endoscope<U+2019>s visual assistance <U+2014> and is not appropriate for emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell of the breast-implant device during its manual insertion through the short <U+2014> two-centimetre (~2.0 cm.) <U+2014> incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.<ref name="johnson">{{cite journal | author=Johnson GW, Christ JE.| title=The Endoscopic Breast augmentation: The Transumbilical Insertion of Saline-filled Breast Implants| journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=1993 | pages=801<U+2013>808 | volume=92 | issue=5 | pmid=8415961}}</ref>

* '''Transabdominal''' <U+2014> as in the TUBA procedure, in the transabdominoplasty breast augmentation (TABA), the breast implants are tunneled superiorly from the abdominal incision into bluntly dissected implant pockets, whilst the patient simultaneously undergoes an [[abdominoplasty]].<ref name="TABA">{{cite journal | author=Wallach SG.| title=Maximizing the Use of the Abdominoplasty Incision| journal=Plastic Reconstruction Surgery | year=2004 | pages=411<U+2013>417| volume=113 | issue=1 | pmid=14707667| doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000091422.11191.1A}}</ref>

===Implant pocket placement===
[[Image:Breast implants.png||thumb|right|170px|Implant pocket placement:
<br> Cross-section of a subglandular breast prosthesis emplacement (1), and of a submuscular breast prosthesis emplacement (2).]]

The [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] emplacement of breast implant devices to the implant pocket is described in relation to the [[pectoralis major muscle]].

* '''Subglandular''' <U+2014> implantation between the breast tissue and the [[pectoralis major muscle]], in the [[retromammary space]]. This position closely approximates the plane of normal breast tissue, and affords the most aesthetic results; but, in thin soft-tissue patients, the subglandular position is likelier to show the ripples and wrinkles of the underlying breast implant; moreover, the capsular-contracture rate is slightly greater.

* '''Subfascial''' <U+2014> the breast implant device is emplaced underneath the [[fascia]] of the [[pectoralis major muscle]]; a variant of the subglandular position.<!--  --><ref name="Graf">{{cite journal | author=Graf RM, et al. | title=Subfascial Breast Implant: A New Procedure | journal= Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2003 | pages=904<U+2013>908 | volume=111 | issue=2 | pmid=12560720 | doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000041601.59651.15}}</ref> The technical benefits of the subfascial breast-implant pocket technique are debated; proponent surgeons report that the layer of [[Fascia|fascial tissue]] provides greater implant coverage and better sustains its position. <!--  --><ref name="subfascial">{{cite journal | author=Tebbetts JB| title=Does Fascia Provide Additional, Meaningful Coverage over a Breast Implant?| journal= Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2004 | pages=777<U+2013>79 | volume=113 | issue=2 | pmid=14758271| doi=10.1097/01.PRS.0000104516.13465.96}}</ref>

* '''Subpectoral''' (dual plane) <U+2014> the breast implant device is emplaced beneath the [[pectoralis major muscle]], after releasing the inferior muscular attachments. Resultantly, the implant device is partially beneath the pectoralis major muscle in the upper pole, while the implant<U+2019>s lower half is in the subglandular plane. This implantation technique achieves maximal upper-implant coverage, whilst allowing the expansion of the lower pole; however, animation (movement) of the breast implants in the subpectoral plane can be excessive for some patients. <!--  --><ref name="Tebbettsdual">{{cite journal | author=Tebbetts T | title=A System for Breast Implant Selection Based on Patient Tissue Characteristics and Implant-soft tissue Dynamics| journal= Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2002 | pages=1396<U+2013>1409 | volume=109 | issue=4 | pmid=11964998 | doi=10.1097/00006534-200204010-00030}}</ref>

* '''Submuscular''' <U+2014> the implant device is emplaced below the [[pectoralis major muscle]], without releasing the inferior origin of the muscle. Total muscular coverage of the breast implant device can be achieved by releasing the lateral muscles of the chest wall <U+2014> either the ''[[serratus muscle]]'' or the ''[[pectoralis minor muscle]]'', or both <U+2014> and [[Suture|suturing]] it, or them, to the pectoralis major muscle. In [[breast reconstruction]] surgery, this emplacement technique effects maximal coverage of the breast implant devices.

===Post-surgical recovery===

The [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] [[Scar|scars]] of a breast augmentation mammoplasty last about six weeks and fade within months. Depending upon the daily physical activity each woman might require, breast augmentation surgery patients usually resume their normal lives about one week post-operative. Women whose breast implants were emplaced beneath the chest muscles (submuscular placement) usually have a longer post<U+2013>operative convalescence, and experience slightly more pain, because of the incisions done to the chest muscles during the augmenation mammoplasty. The patient usually does not exercise or engage in strenuous physical activities for about six weeks. During the initial recovery, the patient is encouraged to regularly exercise (flex and move) her arm to alleviate pain and discomfort; also available are [[analgesic]] medication catheters for alleviating pain.<ref>Pacik, P.T. <U+201C>Pain Control in Augmentation Mammaplasty: Safety and Efficacy of Indwelling Catheters in 644 Consecutive Patients<U+201D> ''Aesthetic Surgery Journal'', 28:279<U+2013>84, May/June 2008</ref><ref>Pacik, P.T. <U+201C>Pain Control in Augmentation Mammaplasty Using Indwelling Catheters in 687 Consecutive Patients: Data Analysis<U+201D>.

===Complications===
The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices <U+2014> whether for [[breast reconstruction]] or for [[Plastic surgery|aesthetic purpose]] <U+2014> presents the same health risks common to surgery, such as adverse reaction to [[anesthesia]], [[hematoma]] (post<U+2013>operative bleeding), [[seroma]] (fluid accumulation), site breakdown (infection); and especially breast pain, altered sensation, impeded breast-feeding, visible wrinkling, asymmetry, thinning of the breast tissue, and [[symmastia]] <U+201C>bread loafing<U+201D>, the disruption of the natural plane between the breasts. Specific treatments for the complications of indwelling breast implants <U+2014> [[capsular contracture]] and capsular rupture <U+2014> are periodic [[MRI]] monitoring and physical examinations. Furthermore, [[Complications (medical)|complications]] and re-operations related to the implantation surgery, and to [[Tissue expansion|tissue expanders]] (implant place-holders during surgery) can cause unfavorable [[Scar|scarring]] in about 6<U+2013>7 per cent of patients.<ref name = AUG_2006>{{cite web | title = Important Information for Women About Breast Augmentation with INAMED Silicone-Filled Breast Implants | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf2/P020056d.pdf |format=PDF| date = 2006-11-03 | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref><ref name = MMG_2006>{{cite web | title = Important Information for Augmentation Patients About Mentor MemoryGel Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants | url = http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf3/p030053d.pdf |format=PDF| date = 2006-11-03 | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}</ref>

====Repair and revision surgeries====
When the patient considers the outcome of an implantation mammoplasty unsatisfactory, or when techhnical or medical complications occur, or because of the breast implants<U+2019> limited product life, it is likely that women might have to replace their breast implants. The common re-operation (replacement) indications include major and minor complications, [[capsular contracture]], shell rupture, and device deflation.<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Re-operation rates were greater for [[breast reconstruction]] patients, because of the post-mastectomy changes in the soft-tissue envelope and to the anatomical breast borders, especially in patients who received adjuvant [[Radiation therapy|XRT]] (external radiation therapy).<ref name = FDA_2004b /> Moreover, besides the reconstruction mammoplasty, breast cancer patients usually undergo surgeries of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and symmetry procedures upon the opposite breast.
Carefully matching of the patient<U+2019>s soft-tissue characteristics to the type and size of the breast implants reduces having to re-operate. With appropriate implant device selection and proper implantation, the re-operation rate was 3.0 per cent at the 7-year-mark, compared with the re-operation rate of 20 per cent at the 3-year-mark, as reported by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.<ref name="Tebbets2006">{{cite journal | author= Tebbets JB | title=Out points" criteria for breast implant removal without replacement and criteria to minimize reoperations following breast augmentation | year=2006 | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | month= October | volume=114 | issue=5 | pages=1258&ndash;62 |pmid= 15457046}}</ref><ref name="Tebbets2">{{cite journal | author= Tebbets JB | title=Achieving a zero percent reoperation rate at 3 years in a 50-consecutive-case augmentation mammaplasty premarket approval study. | year=2006 | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | month= December | volume=118 | issue=6 | pages=1453&ndash;7 |pmid= 17051118 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000239602.99867.07}}</ref>

====Capsular contracture====
{{main|Capsular contracture}}
[[Image:Capsular fibrosis.jpg|thumb|Breast implant complication: Baker scale Grade IV capsular contracture of a subglandular silicone implant in the right breast.]]

The human body<U+2019>s [[immune response]] to surgically installed foreign objects <U+2014> breast implants, cardiac [[Pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[orthopedic]] [[prosthesis|prostheses]] <U+2014> is to cover them with [[Scar|scar tissue]] capsules of tightly woven [[collagen]] fibers; bodily integrity by isolation and toleration. [[Capsular contracture]] occurs when the collagen-fiber capsule thickens and compresses the breast implant, and is a painful [[Complication (medical)|complication]] that might distort the implant device or the breast, or both. The cause of capsular contracture is unknown, but the common incidence factors include bacterial contamination, device-shell rupture, filler leakage, and [[hematoma]].

The device-implantation surgical procedures that have reduced the incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular implant placement, using textured-surface implant devices (polyurethane-coated);<ref name="Barnsley2006">{{cite journal | author=Barnsley GP| title= Textured surface breast implants in the prevention of capsular contracture among breast augmentation patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=2182<U+2013>90| volume=117 | issue=7 | pmid=16772915| doi= 10.1097/01.prs.0000218184.47372.d5 | first2=LJ | first3=SE | last2=Sigurdson | last3=Barnsley}}</ref><ref name="Wong2006">{{cite journal | author=Wong CH, Samuel M, Tan BK, Song C.| title= Capsular contracture in subglandular breast augmentation with textured versus smooth breast implants: a systematic review| journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=1224<U+2013>1236| volume=118 | issue=5 | pmid=17016195| doi= 10.1097/01.prs.0000237013.50283.d2}}</ref><ref name="Handel2006">{{cite journal | author=Handel N, et al.| title= Long-term safety and efficacy of polyurethane foam-covered breast implants | journal=Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | year=2006 | month=may | pages=265<U+2013>74| volume=26 | issue=3| doi= 10.1016/j.asj.2006.04.001 | pmid=19338905}}</ref> limited handling of the implants, limited contact with the recipient site skin before emplacement, and irrigation with triple-antibiotic solutions.<ref name="Mladick1993">{{cite journal | author=Mladick RA| title= "No-touch" submuscular saline breast augmentation technique | journal=Journal of Aesthetic Surgery | year=1993 | pages=183<U+2013>92| volume=17 | issue=3 | pmid= 8213311| doi= 10.1007/BF00636260 }}</ref><ref name="Adams2006">{{cite journal | author=Adams WP jr., et al.| title= Enhancing patient outcomes in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery using triple antibiotic breast irrigation: six-year prospective clinical study | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=2006 | pages=30<U+2013>36 | volume=117 | issue=1 | pmid=16404244 | doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000208306.79104.18}}</ref>

The correction of capsular contracture might require the surgical removal (release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, of the breast implant. Closed capsulotomy (disrupting the capsule via external manipulation), once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but now is a discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external [[medical ultrasound|ultrasonic]] therapy, [[leukotriene]] pathway inhibitors (e.g. Accolate, Singulair), and [[Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy|pulsed electromagnetic field therapy]] (PEMFT).<ref name="Planas2001">{{cite journal | author=Planas J| title= Five-year experience on ultrasonic treatment of breast contractures | journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery | year=2001| pages=89<U+2013>93 | volume=25 | issue=2 | pmid=11349308| doi= 10.1007/s002660010102 | first2=V | first3=G | last2=Cervelli | last3=Planas}}</ref><ref name="Schlesinger2002">{{cite journal | author=Schlesinger SL, wt al| title= Zafirlukast (Accolate): A new treatment for capsular contracture | journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg. | year=2002| pages=329<U+2013>36| volume=22 | issue=4}}</ref><ref name="Scuderi">{{cite journal | author=Scuderi N, et al.| title= The effects of zafirlukast on capsular contracture: preliminary report| journal=Aesthetic Plast Surg. | year=2006| pages=513<U+2013>20 | volume=30 | issue=5 | pmid=16977359| doi= 10.1007/s00266-006-0038-3}}</ref><ref name="Silver1982">{{cite journal | author=Silver H| title= Reduction of capsular contracture with two-stage augmentation mammaplasty and pulsed electromagnetic energy (Diapulse therapy) | journal=Plastic Reconstructive Surgery | year=1982| pages=802<U+2013>08 | volume=69 | issue=5 | pmid=7071225| doi= 10.1097/00006534-198205000-00013}}</ref>

====Platinum toxicity====
The metallic element [[platinum]] is a [[catalyst]] <U+2014> a chemical that accelerates a reaction between two other chemicals, without, itself, forming part of the new compound chemical <U+2014> thus transforming [[silicone oil]] into [[silicone]] gel for the manufacturing of the [[elastomer]] [[silicone]] shell of the breast implant device, and other medical-silicone devices.<ref>Rinzler, Carol Ann (2009) ''The encyclopedia of Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery'' New York:Facts on File, p.23.</ref> The literature indicates that small amounts of platinum leak from such types of silicone breast-implant, therefore, platinum is present in the surrounding pectoral tissue.

==Non-surgical breast augmentation==
===Background===
'''Liposuction'''
<br>The technique of [[liposuction]] (lipoplasty) was conceived by the Italian plastic surgeons Arpat Fischer and Giorgio Fischer in 1974, and was put into medical practice in 1975. <ref>Fischer G. Surgical Treatment of Cellulitis (presentation) Third Congress of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery, Rome, 31 May 1975</ref> Autologous adipocyte fat was harvested by means of 5-mm incisions, and an electrically and pneumatically powered instrument that rotated and alternated in its aspiration of the fat through a [[cannula]]. Meanwhile, through a separate incision to the fat-tissue harvest site, [[saline solution]] was injected to dilute the fat and facilitate its aspiration.<ref>Fischer G. First Surgical Treatment for Modelling the Body<U+2019>s Cellulite with Three 5-mm incisions. Bulletin of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery 1976; 2:35<U+2013>37</ref>
In 1977, Fisher and Fischer reviewed 245 cases with the <U+201C>planotome<U+201D> instrument for treating cellulite in the lateral [[trochanter| trochanteric]] (hip-thigh) areas. There was a 4.9 per cent incidence of [[seroma]]s, despite incision-wound suction [[catheter]]s and compression dressings; 2.0 per cent of the cases presented pseudo-cyst formation that required removal of the capsule ([[cyst]]) through a wider incision (+ 5 mm) and the use of the panotome.<ref>Fischer A., Fischer G. Revised Technique for Cellulite fat reduction in Riding Breeches deformity. Bulletin of the International Academy of Cosmetic Surgery 1977; 2(4):40<U+2013>43</ref> <ref> Schiffman MA. (2010) Autologous Fat Transfer: Art, Science, and Clinical Practice Springer Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, p. 3</ref>

The advent of liposuction technology facilitated medical applications of the liposuction-harvested [[adipocyte|fat tissue]] as autologous filler for injection to correct bodily defects, and for breast augmentation. Dr. Melvin Bircoll introduced the practice of contouring the breast and for correcting bodily defects with autologous fat grafts harvested by liposuction; and he presented the fat-injection method used for emplacing the fat grafts.<ref>Bircoll M. Autologous Fat Transplantation (presentation) The Asian Congress of Plastic Surgery, February 1982</ref> <ref>Bircoll MJ. New Frontiers in Suction Lipectomy (presentation) Second Asian Congress of Plastic Surgery, Pattiya, Thailand, February 1984</ref> The surgeon E. Krulig emplaced fat grafts with a syringe and needle (lipo-injection), and later used a disposable fat trap to facilitate the collection and to ensure the sterility of the harvested adipocyte tissue.<ref>Krulig E. Lipo-injection. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2): 123<U+2013>129</ref> <ref> Schiffman MA. (2010) Autologous Fat Transfer: Art, Science, and Clinical Practice Springer Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, p. 4</ref>

'''Lipo-injector gun'''
<br>To emplace the autologous fat tissue grafts, Drs. J. Newman and J. Levin designed a lipo-injector gun with a gear-driven plunger that allowed the even injection of autologous fat tissue to the desired recipient sites. The control afforded by the injector gun assisted the plastic surgeon in controlling excessive pressure to the fat in the barrel of the syringe, thus avoiding over-filling the recipient site.<ref>Newman J, Levin J. Facial Lipo-transplant Surgery. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2):131<U+2013>140</ref> The later-design lipo-injector gun featured a ratchet-gear operation that that afforded the surgeon great control in accurately emplacing autologous fat to the recipient site; a trigger action injected 0.1 cc of filler.<ref>Agris J.

===Autologous fat grafting===
Autologous fat grafting to the [[breast]] is applied to the correction of breast asymmetry, the correction of breast deformities, [[breast reconstruction]] (as adjunct and primary technique), for the improvement of soft-tissue coverage of breast implants, and for the aesthetic enhancement of the bust. The careful harvesting and [[centrifuge|centrifugal]] refinement of the [[adipocyte|mature adipocyte tissue]] <U+2014> to be injected in small aliquots <U+2014> allows the transplanted fat tissue to remain viable in the breast and provide it the structure and contour that cannot be achieved solely with [[breast implant]]s or with corrective surgery. As in all breast procedures, the grafted fat [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] can suffer [[necrosis]], and concomitant [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]]s and [[cyst]]s, and palpable lumps; the cause of calcification is unknown, but the post-procedure tissue changes resemble those resulting from other breast procedures. The research indicates the efficacy of fat grafting for breast reconstruction the treatment of radiation damage to the chest, the incidental reduction of [[capsular contracture]], and the improved soft-tissue coverage of breast implants. <ref>Pierrefeu-Lagrange, A.

In ''Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy'' (2007), Sydney Coleman and Alessia Saboeiro reported successful transferences of fat to the [[breast]], and proposed [[adipocyte|fat]] grafting as a non-surgical alternative to the usual surgical procedures for breast augmentation, breast defect correction, and breast reconstruction. In a 17-patient group, 2 patients had [[breast cancer]], diagnosed by [[Mammography|mammogram]], one at 12-months post-procedure, and the other at 92-months, after the fat transfer to the breast. In contemporary praxis, beyond the breast proper, fat grafts are injected to the [[pectoralis major muscle]], and to the postpectoral space and to the prepectoral space, before and behind the muscle. In post-mastectomy breast reconstruction, the grafted fat is used to create a breast mound, by augmenting the extant breast tissues.<ref>Coleman SR and Sabeiro AP. Fat Grafting to the breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2007; 119(3):775<U+2013>785</ref>

To the group of 17 patients, structural fat grafting was performed to either one or both breasts; the age range of the women was 25<U+2013>55 years, the mean age was 38.2 years. The indications included [[micromastia]] (10 patients); explantation deformity (one patient); post-augmentation deformity with breast implants (two patients); [[tuberous breast deformity]] (one patient); [[Poland syndrome|Poland<U+2019>s syndrome]] (one patient); and post-mastectomy [[breast reconstruction|reconstruction]] deformity (two patients). The pre-procedure[[Mammography|mammogram]]s were negative for [[Breast diseases|malignant neoplasms]]. The types of [[anaesthesia]] applied were general (two patients) and [[epidural|epidural analgesia]] plus sedation, with local infiltration and intercostal nerve blocks (15 patients). The autologous adipocyte tissue was grafted in one-to-three stages; the average tissue graft volume was 278.6 cc of fat per operation per breast. Post-procedure, the patient was instructed to regard any [[breast disease|lump]] in the breasts as unrelated to the fat grafts, until after a complete medical workup of the breast lump had been performed.<ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 p. 776</ref>

===Techniques===
'''Fat harvesting and contouring'''
<br>The [[Centrifuge|centrifugal]] refinement of the liposuction-harvested [[adipocyte|adipocyte tissues]] removes blood products and free [[lipids]] to produce autologous breast filler. The injectable filler-fat is obtained by centrifuging (spinning) the fat-filled syringes for sufficient time to allow the serum, blood, and oil (liquid fat) components to collect, by density, apart from the refined, injection-quality fat.<ref>Asken S. Autologous Fat Transplantation: Micro and Macro Techniques. American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery 1987; 4(2):111<U+2013>121</ref> To refine the fat for facial injection quality, the fat-filled syringes are centrifuged for 1.0 minute at 2,000 RPM, which separates the unnecessary solution, leaving refined filler fat.<ref>Toledo LS. Syringe Liposculpture: A Two-year Experience. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery 1991;15(4:321<U+2013>326</ref> Moreover, centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes produces a <U+201C>collagen graft<U+201D>; the [[Histology| histologic]] composition of which is [[Cell (biology)|cell]] residues, [[collagen]] fibres, and 5.0 per cent intact [[adipocyte| fat cells]]. Furthermore, because the patient<U+2019>s body naturally absorbs some of the fat grafts, the breasts maintain their contours and volumes for 18<U+2013>24 months.<ref>Uebel CO. Facial Sculpture with Centrifuged fat Collagen, Hinder VT (ed.) Plastic Surgery Vol. II. Amsterdam Excerpta Medica 1992 pp. 749<U+2013>752</ref> <ref> Schiffman MA. (2010) Autologous Fat Transfer: Art, Science, and Clinical Practice Springer Verlag: Berlin, Heidelberg, p. 5</ref>

In the Coleman<U+2013>Saboeiro study, the autologous fat was harvested by [[liposuction]], using a 10-ml syringe attached to a two-hole Coleman harvesting [[cannula]]; after centrifugation, the refined breast-filler [[adipocyte|fat]] was transferred to 3-ml syringes. Blunt infiltration cannulas were used to emplace the fat through 2-mm incisions; the blunt cannula injection method allowed greater dispersion of small aliquots (equal measures) of fat, and reduced the possibility of intravascular fat injection; no sharp needles are used for fat-graft injection to the breasts. The 2-mm incisions were positioned to allow the infiltration (emplacement) of fat grafts from at least two directions; a 0.2 ml fat volume was emplaced with each withdrawal of the cannula.<ref>Coleman SR. Avoidance of Arterial Occlusion from Injection of Soft tissue Fillers. Aesthetic Surgery Journal 22:555,2002. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. March 2007</ref>

The breasts were contoured by layering the fat grafts into different levels within the breast, until achieving the desired breast form. The fat-graft injection technique allows the plastic surgeon precise control in accurately contoruing the breast <U+2014> from the chest wall to the breast-skin envelope <U+2014> with subcutaneous fat grafts to the superficial planes of the breast. This greater degree of breast sculpting is unlike the global augmentation realised with a [[breast implant]] emplaced below the breast or below the [[pectoralis major muscle]], respectively expanding the [[retromammary space]] and the retropectoral space. The greatest proportion of the grafted [[adipocyte|fat]] usually is infiltrated to the pectoralis major muscle, then to the retropectoral space, and to the prepectoral space, (before and behind the pectoralis major muscle). Moreover, although fat grafting to the breast [[parenchyma]] usually is minimal, it is performed to increase the degree of projection of the [[cleavage|bust]].<ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 p. 776</ref>

'''Fat-graft injection'''
<br>The biologic survival of autologous fat [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] depends upon the correct handling of the [[adipocyte|fat]] graft, of its careful washing (refinement) to remove extraneous blood cells, and of the controlled, blunt-cannula injection (emplacement) of the refined fat tissue grafts to an adequately [[Circulatory system|vascularized]] recipient site. Because the body resorbs some of the injected fat grafts (volume loss), compensative over-filling aids in obtaining a satisfactory breast outcome for the patient; thus the transplantation of large-volume fat grafts greater than required, because only 25<U+2013>50 per cent of the fat graft survives at 1-year post-transplantation.<ref>Guerney CE. Experimental Study of the Behavior of Free fat Transplants. Surgery 1938, 3:679<U+2013>692 </ref> Correct technique maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] trauma during the [[Liposuction|liposuction harvesting]] and the [[Centrifuge|centrifugal]] refinement, and by injecting the fat in small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the [[cannula]] maximizes the surface area contact between the grafted fat tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system ([[Circulatory system|blood supply]]) encourages [[Histology|histologic]] survival and minimizes the potential for [[Necrosis|fat necrosis]].<ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. March 2007 p. 779</ref> Transplanted autologous fat tissue undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new fat tissue, if the graft dies it is replaced by [[Fibrous connective tissue|fibrous tissue]]. New fat tissue is generated by the activity of a large, wandering [[Histiocyte|histocyte]]-type [[Cell (biology)|cell]], which ingests fat and then becomes a [[adipocyte|fat cell]].<ref>Neuhof H. (1923) The Transplantation of Tissues New York:D. Appleton p. 74</ref> When the breast filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, which can lead to [[adipocyte|fat tissue]] [[necrosis]], causing lumps, [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]]s, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic [[cyst]]s.

The operating room (OR) time required to harvest, refine, and emplace fat to the breasts is greater than the usual 2-hour OR time; the usual infiltration time was approximately 2-hours for the first 100 cc volume, and approximately 45 minutes for injecting each additional 100 cc volume of breast-filler fat. The technique for injecting fat grafts for breast augmentation allows the [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] great control in sculpting the breasts to the required contour, especially in the correction of [[tuberous breast deformity]]. In which case no fat graft is emplaced beneath the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and the skin envelope of the breast is selectively expanded (contoured) with fat emplaced subcutaneously, immediately beneath the skin. Such controlled contouring selectively increased the proportional volume of the breast in relation to the size of the areola-nipple complex, and thus created a breast of natural form and appearance; greater verisimilitude than is achieved solely with breast implants. The fat-corrected breast implant deformities were inadequate soft-tissue coverage of the implant(s) and [[capsular contracture]], achived with subcutaneous fat grafts that hid the implant-device edges and wrinkles, and decreased the palpability of the underlying breast implant. Furthermore, grafting autologous fat around the breast implant can result in softening the breast capsule.<ref> Rigotti G, Marchi A, Gali<U+00E8> M. et al.

Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (accepted for publication).</ref>

'''External tissue expansion'''
<br>The successful outcome of fat graft breast augmentation requires a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] that will receive grafts of autologous [[adipocyte|adipocyte fat]]. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure ([[vacuum]]) expansion upon [[soft tissues]] derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see [[distraction osteogenesis]]) The study ''Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System'' (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18<U+2013>40 y.o.) wore a brassiere-like vacuum system that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10<U+2013>12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magentic resonance image ([[MRI]]) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient<U+2019>s [[menstrual cycle]]; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the [[clinical trial protocol]].<ref>Khouri RK, Schlenz I, Murphy BJ, Baker TJ. Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2000 June; 105(7): 2500<U+2013>2512; discussion 2513<U+2013>2534</ref>

The breast volume (size) of all 17 women increased throughout the 10-week treatment period, the greatest increment was at week 10 (final treatment) <U+2014> the average volume increase was 98+/<U+2013>67 per cent over the initial breast-size measures. Incidences of partial recoil occurred at 1-week post-procedure, with no further, significant, breast volume decrease afterwards, nor at the follow-up treatment at 30-weeks post-procedure. The stable, long-term increase in breast size was 55 per cent (range 15<U+2013>115%). The MRI visualizations of the breasts showed no [[edema]], and confirmed the proportionate enlargement of the adipose and glandular components of the breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrices]]. Furthermore, a statistically significant decrease in body weight occurred during the study, and [[self-esteem]] questionnaire scores improved from the initial-measure scores.<ref>Khouri RK, Schlenz I, Murphy BJ, Baker TJ. Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2000 June; 105(7): 2500<U+2013>2512; discussion 2513<U+2013>2534</ref>

Because external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues permits injecting large-volume fat grafts (+ 300cc) to correct defects and enhance the bust, the [[Histology|histologic]] viability of the breast filler ([[adipocyte|adipocyte fat]]) and its volume must be monitored and maintained. The long-term, volume maintenance data reported in ''Breast Augmentation using Pre-expansion and Autologous Fat Transplantation: a Clinical Radiological Study'' (2010) indicate the technical effectiveness of external tissue expansion of the recipient site for a 25-patient study group, who had 46 breasts augmented with fat grafts. The indications included [[micromastia]] (under-development), explantation deformity (empty implant pocket), and congenital defects ([[tuberous breast deformity]], [[Poland syndrome|Poland<U+2019>s syndrome]]).<ref>Del Vecchio DA, Bucky LP. Breast Augmentation using Pre-expansion and Autologous fat Transplantation <U+2014> A Clinical Radiological Study. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 2011 February 8</ref> Pre-procedure, every patient used external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues to create a breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] to be injected with autologous fat grafts of [[adipocyte|adipocyte tissue]], refined via low G-force [[Centrifuge|centrifugation]]. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volumes were measured; the patients underwent pre-procedure and 6-month post-procedure [[MRI]] and [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric imaging]] examinations. At 6-months post-procedure, each woman had a significant increase in breast volume, ranging 60<U+2013>200 per cent, per the MRI (n=12) examinations. The size, form, and feel of the breasts was natural; post-procedure MRI examinations revealed no oil [[cysts]] or [[Breast diseases|abnormality]] ([[neoplasm]]) in the fat-augmented breasts. Moreover, given the sensitive, biologic nature of breast tissue, periodic MRI and 3-D volumetric imaging examinations are required to monitor the breast-tissue viability and the maintenance of the large volume (+ 300cc) fat grafts.<ref>Del Vecchio DA, Bucky LP.

===Indications===
Non-surgical breast augmentation with injections of autologous fat grafts ([[adipocyte|adipocyte tissue]]) is indicated for patients requiring [[breast reconstruction]], [[Congenital defect|defect correction]], and the <U+00E6>sthetic enhancement of the bust. 

* '''breast reconstruction''' <U+2014> post-[[mastectomy]] re-creation of the breast(s); trauma-damaged tissues (blunt, penetrating), disease ([[breast cancer]]), and explantation deformity (empty breast-implant socket).

* '''congenital defect correction''' <U+2014> [[micromastia]], [[tuberous breast deformity]], [[Poland Syndrome|Poland<U+2019>s syndrome]], et cetera.

* '''primary augmentation''' <U+2014> the <U+00E6>sthetic enhancement (contouring) of the size, form, and feel of the breasts.

<br>The [[operating room]] (OR) time of breast reconstruction, congenital defect correction, and primary breast augmentation procedures is determined by the indications to be treated.

===Procedures===
'''Post-mastectomy surgical reconstruction'''
<br>Surgical post-[[mastectomy]] [[breast reconstruction]] requires general anaesthesia, cuts the chest muscles, produces new scars, and requires a long post-surgical recovery for the patient. The surgical emplacement of breast implant devices (saline or silicone) introduces a foreign object to the patient<U+2019>s body (see [[capsular contracture]]). The [[TRAM flap]] (trans-abdominal mammoplasty) procedure reconstructs the breast using an autologous flap of muscle and tissues (harvested from either the abdomen or the back) and a [[breast implant]]. The [[DIEP flap]] (deep inferior epigastric perforators) procedure uses an autologous flap of abdominal skin and fat tissue <U+2014> yet it does produce the most aesthetic outcome from surgical breast reconstruction.<ref>Khouri RK (2010) Non-surgical breast reconstruction with autologous fat-grafts</ref>

'''Post-mastectomy fat graft reconstruction'''
<br>The reconstruction of the breast(s) with grafts of autologous fat is a non-surgical alternative to further surgery after a [[breast cancer]] surgery, be it a [[lumpectomy]] or a [[Mastectomy|breast removal]] <U+2014> simple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, modified radical mastectomy, skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple-sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues ([[adipose]], [[Gland|glandular]]) to create a breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] that can be injected with autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC).<ref>Khouri RK (2010) Non-surgical breast reconstruction with autologous fat-grafts</ref> The reconstruction of breasts with fat grafts requires a 3-month treatment period <U+2014> begun after 3<U+2013>5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The autologous breast-filler fat is harvested by [[liposuction]] from the patient<U+2019>s body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), is refined by syringe [[centrifuge]], and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrices]] (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive. The non-surgical breast reconstruction begins at the concluding steps of the [[Mastectomy|breast cancer surgery]], wherein the [[Oncology|oncological]] surgeon is joined by the reconstructive plastic surgeon, who immediately begins harvesting, refining, and injecting fat grafts to the post-mastectomy recipient site. After that initial post-mastectomy fat grafting in the operating room, the patient leaves hospital with a slight '''breast mound''' that will become the foundation tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] for the breast reconstruction.

After 3<U+2013>5 weeks of continual external vacuum expansion of the breast mound (recipient site) <U+2014> to promote the [[Histology|histologic]] regeneration of the extant tissues ([[adipose|fat]], [[Gland|glandular]]) via increased blood circulation to the mastectomy scar (suture site) <U+2014> the patient undergoes the first fat-grafting session for reconstructing her breasts. The external vacuum expansion of the breast mound created an adequate, [[Circulatory system|vascularised]], breast-tissue matrix to which the autologous fat is injected; and, per the patient, such reconstruction affords almost-normal sensation throughout the breast and the nipple-areola complex. Patient recovery from non-surgical fat graft breast reconstruction permits her to resume normal life activities at 3-days post-procedure.<ref>Khouri RK (2010) Non-surgical breast reconstruction with autologous fat-grafts</ref>

'''Tissue engineering: the breast mound'''
<br>The breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] consists of engineered tissues of complex, implanted, biocompatible scaffolds seeded with the appropriate cells. The ''in-situ'' creation of a tissue matrix in the breast mound is begun with the external vacuum expansion of the mastectomy defect tissues (recipient site), for subsequent seeding (injecting) with autologous fat grafts of [[adipocyte|adipocyte tissue]]. The study ''Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External Expansion & Autologous Fat Grafting'' (2010), reported that serial fat-grafting to a pre-expanded recipient site achieved (with a few 2-mm incisions and minimally invasive blunt-cannula injection procedures), a non-surgical outcome equivalent to a surgical breast reconstrcution by [[DIEP flap|autologous-flap]] procedure. Technically, the external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues created a skin envelope as it stretched the [[mastectomy]] [[scar]], and so generated a fertile breast-tissue matrix to which were injected large-volume fat grafts (150<U+2013>600 ml) to create a breast of natural form, look, and feel.<ref>Khouri RK, Cardoso E, Marchi A, Rigotti G. (2010) Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External expansion & Autologous fat Grafting</ref>

The fat graft breast reconstructions for 33 women (47 breasts, 14 irradiated), whose clinical statuses ranged from 0-days to 30-years post-[[mastectomy]], began with the pre-expansion of the breast mound (recipient site) with an external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, for 10<U+2013>30 days before the first grafting of autologous fat. The breast mound expansion was adequate when the mastectomy [[scar]] tissues stretched to create a 200<U+2013>300 ml recipient matrix (skin envelope), that received a fat-suspension volume of 150<U+2013>600 ml in each grafting session.<ref>Khouri RK, Cardoso E, Marchi A, Rigotti G. (2010) Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External expansion & Autologous fat Grafting</ref>

At 1-week post-procedure, the patients resumed using the external vacuum tissue-expander for 10 hours daily, until the next fat grafting session; 2<U+2013>5 outpatient procedures, 6<U+2013>16 weeks apart, were required until the plastic surgeon and the patient were satisfied with the volume, form, and feel of the reconstructed breasts. The follow-up [[Mammography|mammogram]] and [[MRI]] examinations found neither defects ([[necrosis]]) nor abnormalities ([[Breast diseases|neoplasms]]). At 6-months post-procedure, the reconstructed breasts had a natural form, look, and feel, and the stable breast-volumes ranged 300<U+2013>600 ml per breast. The post-procedure mammographies indicated normal, fatty breasts with well-vascularized fat, and few, scattered, benign oil [[cyst]]s. The occurred complications included [[pneumothorax]] and transient cysts. <ref>Khouri RK, Cardoso E, Marchi A, Rigotti G. (2010) Tissue Engineering a Breast Mound by External expansion & Autologous fat Grafting</ref>

'''Explantation deformity'''
<br>The non-surgical fat graft replacement of [[breast implant]]s (saline and silicone) resolves [[Complications (medical)|medical complications]] such as: [[capsular contracture]], implant shell rupture, filler leakage (silent rupture), device deflation, and [[silicone]]-induced [[granulomas]], which are medical conditions usually requiring re-operation and explantation (breast implant removal). The patient then has the option of surgical or non-surgical breast corrections, either replace the explanted breast implants or fat graft breast augmentation.<ref>Khouri, R.K. (2010) Breast Implants Problems and Risks</ref> [[Breast implant]] replacement with autologous [[adipocyte|fat]] grafts requires the external [[vacuum]] pre-expansion of the recipient-site tissues ([[adipose]], [[Gland|glandular]]) to create a breast-tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] to augment with injections of breast-filler fat. Moreover, because fat grafts are biologically sensitive, they cannot survive in the empty implantation socket, instead, they are injected to and diffused within the breas-tissue matrix(recipient site), replacing approximately 50 per cent of the volume of the removed implant <U+2014> as permanent breast augmentation. The outcome of the explantation correction is a bust of natural appearance; breasts of volume, form, and feel, that <U+2014> although approximately 50 per cent smaller than the explanted breast size <U+2014> are larger than the original breast size, pre-procedure. <ref>Khouri, R.K. (2010) Breast Implants Problems and Risks</ref>

'''Breast augmentation'''
<br>The outcome of a breast augmentation with fat-graft injections depends upon proper patient selection, preparation, and correct technique for recipient site expansion, and the harvesting, refining, and injecting of the autologous breast-filler fat. Technical success follows the adequate external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues ([[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]) before the injection of large-volume grafts (220<U+2013>650 cc) of autologous [[adipocyte|fat]] to the breasts. After harvesting by [[liposuction]], the breast-filler fat was obtained by low G-force syringe [[Centrifuge|centrifugation]] of the harvested fat to separate it, by density, from the crystalloid component. The refined breast filler then was injected to the pre-expanded recipient site; post-procedure, the patient resumed continual vacuum expansion therapy upon the injected breast, until the next fat grafting session. The mean operating room (OR) time was 2-hours, and there occurred no incidences of [[infection]], [[cyst]]s, [[seroma]], [[hematoma]], or [[Necrosis|tissue necrosis]].<ref>Del Vecchio D, Bucky LP. Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. October 2010; 126: pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>

The breast-volume data reported in ''Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study'' (2010) indicated a mean increase of 1.2-times the initial breast volume, at 6-months post-procedure. In a 2-year period, 25 patients underwent breast augmentation by fat graft injection; at 3-weeks pre-procedure, before the fat grafting to the breast-tissue matrix (recipient site), the patients were photographed, and examined via intravenous contrast [[MRI]] or [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric imaging]], or both. The breast-filler fat was harvested by liposuction (abdomen, buttocks, thighs), and yielded fat-graft volumes of 220<U+2013>650 cc per breast. At 6-months post-procedure, the follow-up treatment included photographs, intravenous contrast MRI or 3-D volumetric imaging, or both. Each woman had an increased breast volume of 250 cc per breast, a mean volume increase confirmed by quantitative MRI analysis. The mean increase in breast volume was 1.2-times the initial breast volume measurements; the statistical difference between the pre-procedure and the 6-month post-procedure breast volumes was (P< 00.0000007); the percentage increase basis of the breast volume was 60<U+2013>80 per cent of the initial, pre-procedure breast volume.<ref>Del Vecchio D, Bucky LP. Breast Augmentation with Autologous Fat Grafting: A Clinical Radiological Study. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. October 2010; 126: pp. 68<U+2013>69</ref>

===Complications and limitations===
In every [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] and non-surgical procedure, the risk of [[Complications (medical)|complications]] exists before, during, and after a procedure, and, given the sensitive biological nature of breast tissues (adipocyte, glandular), this is especially true in the case of fat graft breast augmentation. Despite its relative technical simplicity, the injection (grafting) technique for breast augmentation is accompanied by post-procedure complications <U+2014> [[adipocyte|fat]] [[necrosis]], [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]], and [[Sclerotic fibroma|sclerotic nodules]] <U+2014> which directly influence the technical efficacy of the procedure, and of achieving a successful outcome. The Chinese study ''Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat-injection Grafting: Management and Clinical analysis of Complications'' (2009), reported that the incidence of medical complications is reduced with strict control of the injection-rate (cc/min.) of the breast-filler volume being administered, and by diffusing the fat-grafts in layers to allow their even distribution within the breast tissue [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]. The complications occurred to the 17-patient group were identified and located with [[X-ray computed tomography|3-D volumetric]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] visualizations of the breast tissues and of any sclerotic lesions and [[Breast disease|abnormal tissue]] masses ([[Breast cancer|malignant neoplasm]]). According to the characteristics of the defect or abnormality, the sclerotic lesion was excised and liquefied fat was aspirated; the excised samples indicated biological changes in the intramammary fat grafts <U+2014> [[Necrosis|fat necrosis]], [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]], [[Hyaline|hyalinization]], and [[fibroplasia]].<ref>Mu DL, Luan J, Mu L, Xin MQ. Breast Augmentation by Autologous Fat injection grafting: Management and Clinical Analysis of Complications. Annals of Plastic Surgery 2009 Aug; 63(2):124<U+2013>127</ref>

The [[Complications (medical)|complications]] associated with injecting [[adipocyte|fat]] grafts to augment the breasts are like, but less severe, than the medical complications associated with other types of breast procedure. Technically, the use of minuscule (2-mm) incisions and blunt-[[cannula]] injection much reduce the incidence of damaging the underlying breast structures (milk ducts, blood vessels, nerves). Injected fat-tissue grafts that are not perfused among the tissues can die, and result in [[Necrosis|necrotic]] [[cyst]]s and eventual [[Metastatic calcification|calcifications]] <U+2014> medical complications common to breast procedures. Nevertheless, a contoured abdomen for the patient is an additional benefit derived from the [[liposuction]] harvesting of the [[adipocyte|adipocyte tissue]] injected to the breasts. (see [[abdominoplasty]])

When the patient<U+2019>s body has insufficient [[adipocyte]] tissue to harvest as injectable breast filler, a combination of fat grafting and [[breast implant]]s might provide the desired outcome. Although non-surgical breast augmentation with fat graft injections is not associated with implant-related medical complications (filler leakage, deflation, visibility, palpability, [[capsular contracture]]), the achievable breast volumes are physically limited; the large-volume, global bust augmentations realised with breast implants are not possible with the method of structural fat grafting. Global breast augmentation contrasts with the controlled breast augmentation of fat-graft injection, in the degree of control that the [[Plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] has in achieving the desired breast contour and volume. The controlled augmentation is realised by infiltrating and diffusing the [[adipocyte|fat]] grafts throughout the breast; and it is feather-layered into the adjacent [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] areas until achieving the desired outcome of breast volume and contour. Nonetheless, the physical fullness-of-breast achieved with injected fat-grafts does not visually translate into the type of buxom fullness achieved with breast implants; hence, patients who had plentiful fat-tissue to harvest attained a maximum breast augmentation of one [[brassiere|brassi<U+0117>re cup-size]] in one session of fat grafting to the breast.<ref> Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 p. 782</ref>

'''Breast cancer'''
<br>'''Detection''' 
<br>A contemporary woman<U+2019>s life-time probability of developing [[breast cancer]] is approximately one in seven;<ref>Gloeckler Ries, L. A., Reichman, M. E., Lewis, D. R., et al. Cancer survival and incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Oncologist 8:541, 2003</ref> yet there is no causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive to breast cancer than are other breast procedures; because incidences of [[adipocyte|fat]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[necrosis]] and [[Metastatic calcification|calcification]] occur in every such procedure: breast [[biopsy]], implantation, [[radiation therapy]], [[breast reduction]], [[breast reconstruction]], and [[liposuction]] of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic [[Mammography|mammographic]] examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among [[Breast cancer|cancerous]] and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable [[lesion]] can be visualized [[Medical ultrasound|ultrasonically]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetically]] (MRI); [[biopsy]] follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a [[radiograph]].<ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery March 2007 pp. 782<U+2013>783</ref>

'''Therapy'''
<br>Breast augmentation via autologous [[adipocyte|fat]] grafts allows the [[Oncology|oncological]] breast surgeon to consider conservative [[Mastectomy|breast surgery]] procedures that usually are precluded by the presence of alloplastic [[breast implants]], e.g. [[lumpectomy]], if [[Breast cancer|cancer]] is detected in an implant-augmented breast. In previously augmented patients, aesthetic outcomes cannot be ensured without removing the implant and performing [[mastectomy]].<ref>Karanas YL, Leong DS, da Lio A et al. Surgical Treatment of Breast Cancer in Previously Augmented Patients. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. 2003 111:1078</ref> <ref> Handel N, Lewinsky B, Jensen J A et al. Breast Conservation Therapy after Augmentation Mammaplasty: Is it Appropriate? Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. 1996 98:1216</ref> Moreover, [[radiotherapy]] treatment is critical to reducing cancerous recurrence and to the maximal conservation of breast tissue; yet, ironically, radiotherapy of an implant-augmented breast much increases the incidence of [[Complications (medical)|medical complications]] <U+2014> [[capsular contracture]], infection, extrusion, and poor cosmetic outcome. <ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. March 2007 pp. 782<U+2013>783</ref>

'''Post-cancer breast reconstruction'''
<br>After [[mastectomy]], surgical breast reconstruction with autogenous [[TRAM flap|skin flaps]] and with [[breast implant]]s can produce subtle deformities and deficiencies resultant from such global breast augmentation, thus the [[breast reconstruction]] is incomplete. In which case, fat graft injection can provide the missing coverage and fullness, and might relax the [[capsular contracture|breast capsule]]. The fat can be injected as either large grafts or as small grafts, as required to correct difficult axillary deficiencies, improper breast contour, visible implant edges, capsular contracture, and tissue damage consequent to [[radiation therapy]]. <ref>Coleman SR, Saboeiro AP, Fat Grafting to the Breast Revisited: Safety and Efficacy. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. March 2007 pp. 782<U+2013>783</ref>

==Thailand breast slap==
''Thailand breast slap'' is a method of supposedly enlarging the [[breasts]] which has been endorsed by the government of [[Thailand]] as an alternative to [[breast implants]]. It was proposed by Khemmikka Na Sonkhla, a beautician who claimed her grandmother used the procedure to enlarge her breasts. The procedure's proponents claim that it also reduces the risk of [[breast cancer]]. The Thai government has currently enrolled over 20 women in publicly-funded courses that teach the technique.<ref>http://thsnews.com/thailand-breast-slap-government-sponsors-bust-enlargement-program/324640/</ref> However, the technique has not been endorsed or proven to be effective by mainstream science outside Thailand. However, a Thai doctor conducted a six-month study that gave promising results; the doctor also encouraged young girls to boost their bust size by eating more.<ref name="indep">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/thailand-sponsors-slapping-to-enhance-breast-size-598437.html|title=Thailand sponsors slapping to enhance breast size|first=Jan|last=McGirk|date=February 22, 2003}}</ref>
