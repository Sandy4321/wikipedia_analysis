The '''Yankees<U+2013>Red Sox rivalry''' is a [[List of sports rivalries|sports rivalry]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Boston Red Sox]] [[baseball]] teams of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). The two teams have competed in MLB's [[American League]] (AL) for over 100 years and have since developed one of the fiercest rivalries in sports.<ref name="BestRivalry">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=21}}</ref><ref name="StrongestRivalry">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=78}}</ref><ref name=UltimateRivalry>{{cite news|title=Sport's ultimate rivalry; Yanks-Red Sox epic battles go way back|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-20-yanks-sox-rivalry_x.htm|date=October 21, 2004|accessdate=January 26, 2011|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|page=3C}}</ref><ref name="Enemies">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-11-cover-rivalry_x.htm|title=Here they go again...; Red Sox vs. Yankees: Bitter enemies clash with Series on line|date=October 12, 2004|accessdate=January 27, 2011|first=Mike|last=Dodd|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C}}</ref> In 1919, Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]] sold star player [[Babe Ruth]] to the Yankees, which was followed by an 86-year period in which the Red Sox did not win a [[World Series]].<ref name=RedSoxPunishment /> This led to the popularization of a superstition known as the "[[Curse of the Bambino]]", which was one of the most well-known aspects of the rivalry.<ref name="BestRivalry" />

==Background==
Since before the start of the [[American Revolution]], [[Boston]] and [[New York City|New York]] have shared an intense rivalry as cities.<ref name="IntenseRivalry">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=22}}</ref> For more than a century after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and economic power in the United States.<ref name="IntenseRivalry"/> Boston's location as the closest American port to [[Europe]] and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.<ref name="IntenseRivalry"/>

In the 19th century, however, New York's economic power soon outpaced Boston's, fueled by possession of the terminus of the [[Erie Canal]], which spurred massive growth in the manufacturing, shipping, insurance and financial services businesses. Another factor was its more rapid population expansion in comparison to Boston, driven by the growth of these industries, by New York's popularity as an [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] [[port of entry]], and enhanced by a larger population base to begin with, even prior to the construction of the Canal&nbsp;<U+2013> on the eve of the Revolution, New York, with 30,000 people, had nearly twice the population of Boston, with about 16,000.<ref name="IntenseRivalry"/> By the start of the 20th century the original dynamic, centered on Boston, had completely shifted as New York became the focus of American capitalism (especially on [[Wall Street]]); this change was reflected in the new national pastime.<ref name="IntenseRivalry"/>

==Early history: Glory of the Red Sox==
[[File:Babe Ruth Red Sox 1918.jpg|thumb|left|[[Babe Ruth]], prior to his trade to the Yankees.]]
The Red Sox were one of the most successful teams in baseball from 1901 to 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=23}}</ref> They won the inaugural [[World Series]] in {{wsy|1903}} (as the Boston Americans; the team changed its name to Red Sox in 1908) and four more between 1912 and 1918.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=23<U+2013>28}}</ref> In 1901, the Yankees, then known as the Baltimore Orioles, played in Maryland for two seasons before moving north.<ref name="Frommer-Page2"/> The two teams had their first meeting while the Yankees franchise was in Baltimore on April 26, 1901, the inaugural year of the American League.<ref name="Frommer-Page2">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=2}}</ref> On May 7, 1903, both teams played for the first time after the franchise moved to New York and became the Highlanders, in reference to playing games in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]].<ref name="Frommer-Page2"/><ref name="Frommer-Page155"/> The game was marked by a fight when Boston pitcher [[George Winter (baseball)|George Winter]] was knocked down.<ref name="Frommer-Page155">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=155}}</ref> Boston would eventually go on to win the [[List of American League pennant winners|pennant]] and the inaugural [[1903 World Series]]. The 1904 season featured the teams facing each other on opening day.<ref name=RedSox2010/><ref name=Yankees2010/> Later in the season, the Highlanders, led by pitcher [[Jack Chesbro]] in his record-setting 41 game-winning season, met the Boston Americans in the season's final game to decide the [[American League]] pennant winner. Chesbro threw a [[wild pitch]] in the top of the ninth inning, allowing the winning run to score from third base, and Boston won the game, and the pennant.<ref>{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=2, 155<U+2013>156}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i_NPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=11QDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2796,3711817|title=Jack Chesbro, Pioneer of Spitball Hurlers and Ace on Old New York Highlanders, Dies of Heart Attack|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=November 7, 1931|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}</ref> However, the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]], who had already clinched the [[National League]] pennant,<ref>{{cite news|title=Going, Going...Gone In a Way, It's 1904 All Over|last=Dufresne|first=Chris|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 1994|page=C1}}</ref> refused to play in the [[1904 World Series]] because of a perception of the "Junior Circuit" as being inferior (and because of alleged animosity between American League founder and first president, [[Ban Johnson]], and the hierarchy of the Giants, owner [[John T.

Years later, on April 11, 1912, the Highlanders debuted their pinstripes in a game against Boston, by then known as the Red Sox.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120410&content_id=28329362&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb|title=100 years ago, Yankees pinstripes are born|first=Bobbie|last=Dittmeier|work=MLB.com|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2012|publisher=Major League Baseball}}</ref> Nine days later, Boston opened [[Fenway Park]] with a game against the Highlanders, who had left their home field of [[Hilltop Park]] to play in the newly-rebuilt [[Polo Grounds]]; soon thereafter, in 1913, the team changed dropped the nickname Highlanders in favor of Yankees.<ref name="Fenway-FirstGame">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=156}}</ref> [[Tris Speaker]] hit an RBI single in the bottom of the eleventh to give the Red Sox a 7<U+2013>6 victory.<ref name="Fenway-FirstGame"/> Boston's victory in their first game at the new park failed to become front page news, however, due to the coverage being devoted to the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|days-prior sinking of the Titanic]].<ref>{{cite news|quote=The ballpark's grand opening on April 20, 1912, did not even make Boston's front pages.

Six years later, the [[Chicago Cubs]] scored two runs off of Babe Ruth in game 4 of the [[1918 World Series|Series]], snapping his then record World Series scoreless inning streak at {{frac|29|2|3}} innings.<ref name="1918WorldSeries">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=28}}</ref> However, the Red Sox won the game 2<U+2013>1, and went on to capture their fifth Series title, their third in four years, and fourth in seven years.<ref name="1918WorldSeries"/>

The Yankees would however receive one notable moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher [[George Mogridge]] threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, the first in the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. It would also turn out to be the Yankees only no-hitter where they allowed a run as they would win the game 2<U+2013>1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1917-schedule-scores.shtml|title=1917 New York Yankees Schedule, Box Scores and Splits

==Babe Ruth sold to Yankees==
[[File:Harry-frazee.jpg|thumb|right|[[Harry Frazee]], the owner of the Red Sox, sold Ruth to the Yankees. This began the "Curse of the Bambino".|upright]]
In 1916, Harry Frazee purchased the Red Sox, on credit, for $500,000. Despite Ruth's success with the Red Sox, owner and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] producer Frazee lost his patience with Ruth, who had threatened to hold out in lieu of a larger contract and become a distraction. After the Red Sox finished sixth in the American League in 1919, Frazee, needing money to finance a Broadway musical, ''[[No, No Nanette]],'' sold pitcher-turned-outfielder Babe Ruth to the Yankees.<ref name=RedSoxPunishment>{{cite news|title=When Red Sox Fold, It's Always 'My Fault'|date=September 21, 1990|first=Thomas|last=Boswell|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|page=C1|authorlink=Thomas Boswell|quote=The Red Sox are being punished because they sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920 so owner Harry Frazee could finance a lightweight Broadway musical called 'No, No, Nanette.'}}</ref> Frazee received $125,000 and a loan of $300,000<U+2014>secured on Fenway Park, the Red Sox' home stadium<U+2014>for Ruth,<ref name=RedSoxPunishment/> despite Ruth having set the record for home runs with 29 in 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|p=53}}</ref> This began a series of deals with the Yankees that resulted in a long period of mediocrity for the Red Sox while the Yankees began their dynasty.<ref name="Dynasty">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=23}}</ref>

Ruth's arrival in New York simultaneously launched the Yankee dynasty while ravaging the Red Sox. While the Red Sox's five World Series titles were a record at the time, 1918 would be the team's last championship for 86 years. Meanwhile, Ruth's home run-hitting prowess anchored the Yankee line-up, which became known as "[[Murderers' Row]]" in the late 1920s. The Yankees reached the World Series seven times during Ruth's New York years, winning four. This abrupt reversal of fortunes for the Red Sox marked the beginning of the supposed "[[Curse of the Bambino]]."<ref name=UltimateRivalry/> But it was not the Ruth deal alone that reversed the fortunes of both clubs.<ref name="Dynasty"/> Frazee also sold many other players to the Yankees.<ref name=SABR>{{cite web|last=Levitt|first=Dan|title=Harry Frazee and the Red Sox|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/harry-frazee-and-the-red-sox|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research|accessdate=10 July 2012}}</ref>

[[Robert W. Creamer]] reported that "[the] loan was made and relations between the two clubs continued to be cordial, with Frazee sending player after player to the Yankees over the next few seasons for more and more cash. This was no accident. Frazee and Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert were friends, and American League president Ban Johnson's attempts to drive Frazee out of the game had caused the five teams loyal to Johnson to make no deals with the Red Sox as long as Frazee owned the club, leaving only the Yankees and White Sox as trading partners. When the White Sox's reputation was destroyed in the [[Black Sox Scandal]], Frazee's only option for trades was to deal with the Yankees.
The Red Sox soon became a baseball disaster area, finishing dead last nine times in eleven seasons."<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Creamer|title=Babe: The Legend Comes to Life|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1974|page=209|authorlink=Robert Creamer}}</ref> Among others, [[Wally Schang]], [[Everett Scott]], [[Carl Mays]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Bullet Joe Bush|Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones|Sam Jones]] went from the Sox to the Yankees in the next one to three years,<ref name="SoxToYankees">{{harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=2}}</ref> along with [[Ed Barrow]], the former Red Sox manager who became the Yankees' general manager and empire-builder for the first quarter-century of the Yankees' dynasty.<ref name="Dynasty"/><ref name="SoxToYankees"/><ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=36, 43}}</ref> Scott, a former Red Sox team captain, actually took the reins as [[List of New York Yankees team captains|Yankee captain]] from Ruth when he arrived and in doing so became the only player in history to be named captain for both teams.<ref name=Scott>{{cite web|last=Birch|first=Ray|title=Everett Scott|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/365591cd|publisher=Society for American Baseball Research}}</ref>

==Curse of the Bambino==
From 1920 through 2003, the Yankees won 26 World Series championships and 39 pennants, compared to only four pennants for the Red Sox. In every year that the Red Sox won the pennant<U+2014>[[1946 Boston Red Sox season|1946]], [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|1967]], [[1975 American League Championship Series|1975]] and [[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]]<U+2014>they lost the World Series four games to three, leaving them with no World Series titles.<ref name="Championships">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=238, 242<U+2013>243}}</ref> During this time, the Red Sox finished second in the standings to the Yankees on twelve occasions<U+2014>in 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, 1949, 1977, 1978, and every year from 1998 to 2003.<ref name="FirstSecond">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=80}}</ref><ref name="Standings">{{harvnb|Vaccaro|2005|p=25}}</ref> During the 84-year period, the Yankees finished with a better regular-season record than the Red Sox 66 times,<ref name="FirstSecond"/> leading one sportswriter to quip that the Yankees' rivalry with the Red Sox was much like the rivalry "between a hammer and a nail."<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|The Boston Globe|Araton|Kepner|2004|p=1}}</ref> However, the Yankees finished second in the standings to the Red Sox twice, in 1986 and 1995.<ref name="Standings"/>

Just two years after Ruth's sale, he went on to have a record setting season<U+2014>statistically, one of the greatest in major league history for a batter.<ref name="NewHomeIn1923"/> This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their [[Yankees<U+2013>Giants rivalry|rival]] Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won the [[1921 World Series|their very first World Series]] game.<ref name="Yankees-FirstSeries">{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=59, 65}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Yanks Win, 3 to 0; Mays Curbs Giants; Ruth Bats in a Run|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 1921|page=1}}</ref> However, Ruth got hurt during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series.<ref name="Yankees-FirstSeries"/> Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the [[1922 World Series]] as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hunt for Home is Spared to Yanks|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 22, 1920|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ruth Crashes Out Homers 50 and 51|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 25, 1920|page=19}}</ref>

The Yankees would eventually move across the [[Harlem River]] to the Bronx into [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. On April 18, 1923, both the Red Sox and Yankees played for the first time at the Yankees new home.<ref name="NewHomeIn1923">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=36}}</ref> Over 74,200 people watched the Yankees defeat the Red Sox, 4<U+2013>1, in the first game played at the stadium.<ref name="NewHomeIn1923"/> Babe Ruth hit the new stadium's first home run, christening the stadium as "the House that Ruth Built."<ref name="NewHomeIn1923"/> Ruth would finish the year with a .393 [[batting average]], while being walked a then-record 170 times. The Yankees met the New York Giants for the third straight year in the World Series. The [[1923 World Series]] resulted with the Yankees winning their first World Championship. Of the 24 players on the Yankees' first championship team, 11 came from the Red Sox.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=44}}</ref>

Several lesser known moments in the rivalry occurred during the 1930s. Pitcher [[Red Ruffing]] was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Red Ruffing Trades and Transactions|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=ruffire01|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref> Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning 6 World Series with them.<ref name=BBHoF>{{cite web|title=Ruffing, Red|url=http://baseballhall.org/hof/ruffing-red|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame}}</ref> On August 12, 1934, then the largest crowd in the history of Fenway Park, 46,766, witnessed Babe Ruth's final game at Fenway Park in a Yankees uniform in a game Boston would lose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/ballpark/information/index.jsp?content=milestones|work=Major League Baseball|publisher=Boston Red Sox}}</ref> A year later, the crowd record would be broken again when the two teams met again on September 22, 1935.

Righetti retained the single-season record for left-handers until {{mlby|1993}}, when [[Randy Myers]] saved 53 games for the Chicago Cubs; Righetti still owns the AL record for left-handers. 

Righetti's teammate, first baseman and defending American League MVP [[Don Mattingly]], came into the last game batting .352, second in the league to Boston's Wade Boggs. With Boggs sitting out the game, Mattingly needed to go 6 for 6 to win the batting title. Although Mattingly would hit a home run in his first at bat and a double later on, he fell short and Boggs won the batting title. Mattingly would be named most outstanding player that year by the press, but fell short to Boggs' teammate [[Roger Clemens]] in the AL MVP voting.

Despite Righetti's pitching on the last day of the season, the Red Sox still won the division and marched on in the playoffs. The Yankees' bad performance during the 1980s came when the Red Sox faced the Yankees' [[Mets<U+2013>Yankees rivalry|cross-town rival]]s, the [[New York Mets]], in the World Series. ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the series a "painful series".<ref>{{cite news|title=It's More than Baseball; For Yankee Fans, A Painful Series|date=October 19, 1986|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A51}}</ref> ''[[Newsday]]'' called it "woeful days for Yankee fans".<ref name=Steinbrenner>{{cite news|title=And What If You're a Yankees Fan?|date=October 18, 1986|first=Richard C.|last=Firstman|newspaper=Newsday|page=83}}</ref> [[Mike Lupica]] of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' called the series "the World Series that is the Yankee nightmare".<ref>{{cite news|title=Yankees' Fans Get Worst of Both Worlds|date=October 18, 1986|first=Mike|last=Lupica|authorlink=Mike Lupica|newspaper=New York Daily News}}</ref> Both ''Newsday'' and ''The Boston Globe'' said there were Mets T-shirts saying "Steinbrenner's nightmare,"<ref name=Steinbrenner/><ref>{{cite news|quote=At McGonnell's bar, the sporting center of New York City...on display for sale behind the bar were Mets/Sox T-shirts with "Steinbrenner's nightmare" stenciled on the backs, the creation of one of the bar's regulars.|title=Lopsided Score Means Early Exit for NY Fans|date=October 20, 1986|first=Diane|last=Alters|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=42}}</ref> referring to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.

In game six of the World Series, Boston (leading the series three games to two) took a 5<U+2013>3 lead in the top of the 10th inning. In the bottom half of the frame, Red Sox reliever [[Calvin Schiraldi]] retired the first two batters, putting the team within one out of winning the World Series. However, the Mets scored three unanswered runs, tying the game on a wild pitch from [[Bob Stanley]] and winning it when Boston first baseman [[Bill Buckner]] allowed a ground ball hit by the Mets' [[Mookie Wilson]] to roll through his legs, scoring [[Ray Knight]] from second base. In the seventh game, the Red Sox took an early 3<U+2013>0 lead, only to lose 8<U+2013>5. The collapses in the last two games prompted a series of articles by [[George Vecsey]] of ''The New York Times'' fueling speculation that the Red Sox were "cursed".<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=175}}</ref><ref name="Shaughnessy 2005 8">{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES: THE WORLD SERIES '86; Red Sox: 68 Years and Counting|date=October 26, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|newspaper=The New York Times|page=A3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D33}}</ref>

===1990<U+2013>1995===
The tone of baseball rivalries changed in the early 1990s; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a "friendly" level.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rival relationships: Love to hate romance|last=Bradley|first=Jeff|date=July 20, 1993|newspaper=New York Daily News|quote=It's clear that this is the way of sports in the 1990s, love conquering all.

Prior to the realignment, the [[American League East]] Division contained seven teams, spread out over a wider geographical area, including the [[Cleveland Indians]] and the [[Milwaukee Brewers]].

In the early to mid-1990s, the two teams were seldom equally good. The Yankees had the worst record in the American League when the Red Sox won their third division title in five years in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1990.shtml|title=1990 American League Team Statistics and Standings|accessdate=January 26, 2011|work=Baseball Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> In 1992, both teams finished at or near the bottom of the AL East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1992.shtml|title=1992 American League Team Statistics and Standings|accessdate=January 26, 2011|work=Baseball Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref>

On June 6, 1990, before a Yankees<U+2013>Red Sox game at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired [[Bucky Dent]] as their manager, making Fenway Park the scene of his worst moment as manager, although he had his greatest moment as a player there.<ref name=DentFired>{{cite news|title=Dent Dumped by Yankees|date=June 7, 1990|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=37}}</ref> Red Sox fans felt retribution as Dent was fired on their field,<ref name=DentFired/><ref>{{cite news|title=As Bucky Goes, Fans Find Plenty to Blame|first=Chapin|last=Wright|first2=Rose Marie|last2=Arce|newspaper=Newsday|date=June 7, 1990|quote=Red Sox fan Dave Searls, who lives in Boston, MA and watched Dent manage his last game Tuesday night at Fenway Park, said, 'Hooray!

A year after captain Don Mattingly's retirement in 1995, the Yankees won the [[1996 World Series]].

The Yankees defeated the Red Sox at Fenway Park and completed a five-game sweep of the Red Sox in the first five-game series between the teams in 33 years, evoking memories of 1978's "Boston Massacre".

The off-season after the 2007 Series showed a war of words between management of both teams.

Epstein claimed that Mussina had used it as a crutch during the season.

Using [[Facebook]] [[Like button]] data, Ben Blatt of the [[Harvard College]] Sports Analysis Collective found in 2012 that Red Sox fans are east of the New York State-Vermont/Massachusetts border, and Yankees fans are west. Blatt wrote, "I had thought that it was possible that Red Sox Nation might extend into northern New York or Yankee territory might extend into Vermont. This turned out not to be the case". Connecticut divides support between the two teams; he found that 56.6% of Facebook users in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], often cited as being on the border between the two teams' fans, supported the Yankees.
