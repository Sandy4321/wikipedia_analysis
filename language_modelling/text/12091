==Biography==

Bernard first trained in law, obtaining a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1931 and embarking on an internship in 1932, but decided instead to pursue an advanced degree at [[Columbia University]].<ref>Hackett, 196<U+2013>197</ref> There, according to 2010's ''The Madman's Middle Way'', Bernard, who described himself as "the first white [[lama]]", became the first American to write a dissertation on the subject of Tibetan Buddhism.<ref name=Lopez>{{cite book|author=[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]]|title=The Madman's Middle Way: Reflections on Reality of the Tibetan Monk Gendun Chopel|accessdate=2 April 2011|date=15 May 2007|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-49317-6|page=31}}</ref>

In 1936, he toured India and Tibet with his wife, Viola, studying [[Tantric Yoga]] in an effort to master its fundamental principles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Syman|first=Stefanie|title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America|date=22 June 2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-374-23676-2|pages= 119<U+2013>120, 122.}}</ref> On his return to the United States in 1937, his experiences were published across the country over several weeks by the [[North American Newspaper Alliance]] and [[Bell Syndicate]].<ref>Syman, 123.</ref> This was followed by a series of lectures and radio appearances in 1939 and by the publication of the [[memoir]] ''Penthouse of the Gods''.<ref>Hackett, 687-690.</ref> Bernard was also featured in popular magazines, including a cover story in ''[[Family Circle]]'' in 1939, followed shortly by his second book, ''Heaven Lies Within Us'', which explored [[Hatha Yoga]] under the guise of an auto-biography.<ref>Hackett, 695-701</ref> According to 2008's ''Barbarian Lands'', many of the experiences Bernard describes in his books have recently been discovered to have been fabricated, based on the experiences of his father.<ref>Hackett, 694-702.</ref> In 1939, Bernard opened the American Institute of Yoga and Pierre Health Studios.<ref>Hackett, 726-730</ref><ref>Syman, 132</ref>

In 1947, he again visited northern India, and went missing in Pakistan in October 1947. He was declared dead several months later, though his body was never found.<ref>{{cite book|last=Love|first=Robert|title=The Great Oom: The Improbable Birth of Yoga in America|year= 2010|publisher=Viking Adult|isbn=|page= 315}}</ref>
