==Biography==
Fedor Emelianenko was born in 1976 in Rubezhnoe, [[Luhansk]], part of the [[Luhansk Oblast]] region,<ref name="bio" /> presently a part of [[Ukraine]] (part of the [[Soviet Union]] at the time). His family moved to [[Stary Oskol]], [[Russia]] in 1978. His mother, Olga Feodorovna, is a teacher and his father, Vladimir Alexandrovich, is a gas-electric welder. Emelianenko is the second child in the family and has an older sister, Marina, and two younger brothers, [[Aleksander Emelianenko|Aleksander]] (born 1981) and Ivan (born 1988). Aleksander is also a mixed martial artist, and Ivan is currently in training, although he does not train at the the level at which his brothers do.<ref name="ros" /><ref name="fig">{{cite web

Emelianenko finished high school in 1991 and graduated with honors from a professional trade school in 1994. From 1995 until 1997, he served in the [[Russian Army]] as a military firefighter.<ref name="ros" />

In 1999 he married his wife, Oksana, who had their first daughter, Masha, in the same year.<ref name="bio" /> In his spare time, he likes the sun and going to the beach. He has stated he likes reading, music, and art, and some of his paintings can be viewed on his official website.<ref>{{cite web

===Martial arts background and training regimen===
Emelianenko's enthusiasm for fighting began with [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]] and [[Judo]]. He initially trained under Vasiliy Ivanovich Gavrilov, and later under his current coach, Vladimir Mihailovich Voronov. Voronov remembers that ten-year-old Fedor was relatively weak physically and did not have an innate grappling talent; instead, his biggest strength was his perseverance and strong will.<ref>{{cite web

Emeliananko's official biography erroneously states that he trained in Sambo during his army years. However, Fedor has specified in his 2005 Amsterdam interview that this is incorrect, and his training in the army was limited to running and strength training in a makeshift gym he put together himself.<ref name="ams" />

In 1997, Emelianenko received the official certification of a "[[Unified Sports Classification System of the USSR|Master of Sports]]" in Sambo and Judo and became part of the Russian national team.<ref>{{cite web

Fedor used to weight train extensively, but in 1999 he almost completely substituted his weight exercises with sport-specific training in grappling, boxing and kickboxing.<ref name="fig" /> His strength training consists of daily [[pull-up]]s, [[push up]]s on [[parallel bars]], and [[crunches]].<ref>{{cite web

===Club affiliation===
Fedor Emelianenko began his mixed martial arts as a member of Russian Top Team, training with the first generation of Russian [[Fighting Network RINGS|RINGS]] competitors, such as [[Volk Han]] and Andrey Kopylov. After winning his PRIDE Heavyweight title, a rift grew between Fedor and the manager of RTT, Vladimir Evgenevich Pogodin. According to Emelianenko, Pogodin, who held the position of vice-president in the World Sambo Federation, attempted to control Emelianenko's career through threats and abuse of his position to deny 'master of sport' titles to Fedor and his brother Aleksander, in addition to financial disputes between Pogodin and Emelianenko, with Fedor alleging he was deceived by Pogodin.<ref>{{cite web

Emelianenko is also a member of the VOS gym in [[Holland]], where he trains with Yogan Vos and Lucien Carbin.<ref name="ams" />

===RINGS===
Emelianenko's only loss in the sport came at the hands of [[Tsuyoshi Kohsaka]] at the King of Kings 2000 Block B event on [[December 22]] [[2000]], via doctor stoppage due to a cut 17 seconds into the fight.<ref name="bio" /><ref>{{cite web

}} &mdash;Fedor Emelianenko</ref> Since the fight was in a tournament format, a winner and loser was required as no draws or no contests could be awarded. Since Emelianenko could not advance due to his injury, Kohsaka moved on (the match would have been a no contest or disqualification victory for Emelianenko otherwise). He avenged the loss at the [[PRIDE Bushido 6]] event on [[April 3]] [[2005]], defeating Kohsaka by technical knockout when the ring doctor stopped the fight after the first round.

===PRIDE Fighting Championships===
Entering [[PRIDE]] on the heels of winning the RINGS King of Kings 2002 tournament, Emelianenko debuted at [[PRIDE 21]] on [[June 23]], [[2002]] against the 6&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in, 256&nbsp;lb [[Dutch People|Dutch]] 2005 and 2006 [[K-1]] World Champion [[Semmy Schilt]], whom he defeated by unanimous decision. His next opponent was [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]] [[Heath Herring]], in a contest to establish the number one contender for the heavyweight title. Emelianenko, considered an underdog at the time, defeated Herring by doctor stoppage after the first round due to strikes to the head. This impressive victory against a perennial contender catapulted him into the upper echelon of the sport.

Emelianenko was then signed to fight heavily favored [[Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira]] for PRIDE's heavyweight championship title at [[PRIDE 25]] on [[March 16]], [[2003]].<ref>{{cite web

Surprising many observers, Emelianenko managed to dominate Filipovi<U+0107> in stand up fighting, landing many hard body shots, and controlled the bout on the ground. He has later stated that his hand injury took away his grip strength and so prevented him from trying submissions.<ref>{{cite web

Emelianenko's most recent title defense was against 2001 K-1 World Grand Prix champion [[Mark Hunt]] at [[PRIDE Shockwave 2006|Shockwave 2006]]. Sporting a broken toe during the contest, Emelianenko nevertheless secured an armbar in the second minute of the first round, but Hunt was able to escape and counter by stepping over Emelianenko, ending in [[side control]]. At five minutes into the first round, Hunt made two attempts at an [[Armlock#Americana|americana]] on Emelianenko<U+2019>s left arm but failed to complete them.<ref>{{cite web

===BodogFight===
With a special clause in his PRIDE contract that allowed him to fight under the banner of any mixed martial arts organization as long as the event was held on Russian soil, Emelianenko accepted a match in [[BodogFight]] against [[Matt Lindland]]. The fight was held on [[April 14]], [[2007]] at the "Clash of the Nations" event in [[St. Petersburg]], Russia. Lindland moved up two weight classes (from [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] to [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]]) for the match and came in weighing 218&nbsp;lb to Emelianenko's 233. Early in the fight, Lindland opened a cut above Emelianenko's left eye and clinched with him, pushing him against the ropes and seemingly working towards a takedown. Lindland eventually used a [[bear hug|bodylock]] and attempted to take Emelianenko down. The takedown was reversed, though, and Emelianenko landed on top of Lindland. Emelianenko won by submission via an armbar at 2:58 of the first round.

Since the purchase of [[PRIDE]] by the majority owners of [[UFC]] and the expiration of Emelianenko's contract with PRIDE, there has been speculation about the possibility of him fighting in the [[UFC]]. In a recent interview with [[Chuck Liddell]], he stated that Emelianenko was on his way to the [[UFC]].<ref>{{cite web
