Her father was killed when she was young; her mother later married Shorty Lungkarta Tjungarrayi, an artist whose work was a significant influence on Linda Syddick's painting.

Linda Syddick was one of many Western Desert women who took up painting in the early 1990s, as part of a broader [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] movement. She began painting some time prior to 1991, when her work was first exhibited in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]]. Her work includes a distinctive fusion of Christian and Aboriginal traditional themes and motifs. She has been a finalist in the [[National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award]]s on at least four occasions, and in the [[Blake Prize]] (a religious art competition) at least three times. Her works are held by numerous galleries including the [[National Gallery of Australia]], the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] and the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]]. Linda Syddick was the subject of a portrait painted by [[Robert Hannaford]], which was a 1992 finalist in Australia's premiere portrait competition, the [[Archibald Prize]].

===Background===
Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began painting in 1971, assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya <U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press|location=University of Melbourne|year=2006|ISBN=0-522-85110-X}}</ref> This initiative, which used [[acrylic paint]]s to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<ref name="Dussart06">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|year=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156<U+2013>168}}</ref> By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<ref name="Morphy99">{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|year=1999|ISBN=0-7148-3752-0|pages=261<U+2013>316}}</ref> The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia towards women painting.<ref name="Strocchi06">{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|year=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=Artlink|volume=26|issue=4}}</ref> However, there was also a desire amongst many of the women to participate, and in the 1990s a large number of them began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]], [[Balgo, Western Australia|Balgo]], and on the [[outstation movement|outstations]], people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.<ref name="Morphy99"/>

===Career===
Linda Syddick was painting by 1991, when her works were hung in a private gallery<U+2014>Gallery Gondwana<U+2014>in [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]].<ref name="Myers"/> Her works, such as ''A nest of crosses, gladly borne'' painted for an exhibition titled ''Mary Mackillop: a tribute'', combine traditional Indigenous painting techniques and motifs with Christian imagery and themes.<ref name="AGSA96"/> Linda Syddick had two paintings included in an exhibition, ''From Appreciation to Appropriation'', at the Flinders University Art Museum City Gallery in 2000.
