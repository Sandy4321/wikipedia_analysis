Retrieved [[11 April]] [[2007]].</ref>]]
The '''National Register of Historic Places''' is the [[United States government|United States government's]] official list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects worthy of preservation. The National Register was established in 1966 with the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966|National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA). Out of the over one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually, the others are [[contributing property|contributing members]] within [[historic district]]s. Each year 30,000 properties join the National Register as part of districts or through individual listings. 

For most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), which is under the auspices of the [[United States Department of Interior]]. Its goals are to help property owners and groups, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], coordinate, and identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, they do provide some financial incentive to listed property owners. During the nomination process it is determined whether or not a nominee adheres to at least one of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics in the fields of history and preservation, as well as the public, and politicians.

Occasionally historic sites outside the country proper but associated with the United States (such as the [[American Legation, Tangier|American Embassy in Tangiers]]) are also listed. Properties can be nominated in a variety of forms including individual properties, historic districts and [[Multiple Property Submission]]s (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties, building, structure, site, object, and districts. Historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing property types. Some areas are added to the National Register automatically when they come under the [[aegis]] of the National Park Service. These include [[National Historic Landmark]]s (NHL), [[National Historic Site]]s (NHS), [[National Historical Park]]s, [[National Military Park|National Military Parks/Battlefields]], [[National Memorial]]s and [[National Monument]]s.

To encompass the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service under the U.S. Department of Interior, under director George B. Hartzog, Jr., established an administrative division called the [[Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation]] (OAHP).<ref name=fisher/><ref name=scarpino>Scarpino, Philip V.

The first official [[Keeper of the Register]] was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian.<ref name=nhlhistory/> In the Register's earliest years, the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed and underfunded.<ref name=scarpino/> Indeed, money was tight, but funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching [[grants-in-aid]] to listed property owners, first in house museums  and institutional buildings but later in commercial structures as well.<ref name=fisher/> 

A few years later, in 1973, the NPS history programs affiliated with both the [[United States National Park|U.S. National Parks]] system and the National Register were formally categorized into two "Assistant Directorates." Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation.<ref name=bearss/> From 1978 until 1981 the lead agency for the NRHP was the [[Heritage Conservation and Recreation Services|Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service]] (HCRS) within the [[United States Department of Interior]].<ref name=hert>Hertfelder, Eric.

In February 1983 the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize that the programs are both [[directorate]]s were interdependent. Jerry L. Rogers, described as a skilled administrator who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs, academia and local governments, was picked to lead this newly merged associate directorate.<ref name=bearss/>

Though not initially spelled out in the 1966 act reliance on the SHPO eventually became important as part of the process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments to the 1966 law further laid out the responsibilities of SHPO concerning the federal National Register.<ref name=hert/> 1992 amendments to the NHPA added a classification to the National Register known as Traditional Cultural Properties; properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups.<ref name=Ferguson/>

The National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its beginnings as legislation in 1966. In 1986 citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites and districts for inclusion on the NRHP, a total of 75,000 separate properties.<ref name=hert/> Out of the over one million properties on the National Register, 80,000 are listed individually, the others are [[contributing property|contributing members]] within [[historic district]]s.<ref name=fisher> Fisher, Charles E.

Until 1976 [[tax incentive]]s were virtually non-existent for buildings on the National Register. Before 1976 the federal [[tax code]] favored new construction over the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures.<ref name=fisher/> After 1976 the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives which promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The responsibility of ensuring that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for the federal tax incentives fell to the National Park Service. Properties and sites listed on the Register as well as those considered contributing properties to a local historic district "approved by the Park Service" became eligible for the federal tax benefits.<ref name=fisher/>

Owners of properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places can be eligible for a 20% investment tax credit for the "certified rehabilitation of income-producing certified historic structures." The rehabilitation can be as commercial, industrial or residential, for rentals.<ref name=listing/> The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is jointly managed by the National Park Service, SHPO, and the [[Internal Revenue Service]].<ref name=tps1>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/tps/tax/index.htm Historic Preservation Tax Incentives]", Technical Preservation Services, ''National Park Service'', Official site.

Retrieved [[22 March]], [[2007]].</ref> 

In addition, some property owners may qualify for grants as well, including the Save America's Treasures grants which apply specifically to NRHP properties which were entered in the Register at a national level of significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks.<ref name=grants1>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/treasures/faqs.htm#2 Save America's Treasurers: FAQ]" National Park Service. Retrieved [[23 March]] [[2007]].</ref>

The NHPA made no distinction between properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants. This was deliberate on the part of the 1966 act's authors, past experience had shown that categories of significance caused the lowest category to become expendable.<ref name=nhlhistory/> Essentially, this reduced the Landmarks to little more than the "honor roll" of the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=nhlhistory/>

==Nomination process==
{{rquote|right|It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States Government that special effort should be made to preserve the natural beauty of the countryside and public park and recreation lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites.<ref name=DOT>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_DOTAct.pdf Department of Transportation Act]," ([[PDF]]), ''National Park Service'', Official site. Retrieved [[21 March]], [[2007]].</ref>| (49 [[U.S. Code|USC]] 303)}} Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination although [[historian]]s and [[historic preservation]] consultants are often employed for this work. The nomination contains basic information on the type of significance embodied in the building, district, or site.<ref name=criteria/> The State Historic Preservation Office receives National Register nominations and supplies feedback to the individual or group preparing the nomination, which is done via a standard nomination form. The SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic preservation advisory board which then recommends whether the [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] should forward it to the Keeper of the Register. Only the State Historic Preservation Officer can officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. The nomination is sent to the National Park Service which then approves or denies the nomination. If approved, it is officially entered by the Keeper of the Register into the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=criteria/> Owners are also informed of the nomination during the review by the SHPO. If an owner objects to a nomination, or in the case of an historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name=criteria/>

Retrieved [[22 March]], [[2007]].</ref> Information on [[architectural style]]s, association with various aspects of [[social history]] and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination generally provides a narrative section which describes the site or building in detail and justifies why it is historically significant. The NRHP criteria fall into four categories. To meet the "Event" category, criterion A, the property must make a contribution to the broad patterns of [[History of the United States|American history]]. Criterion B, "Person," is associated with significant people in the American past. The third criterion, C, "Design/Construction," is affiliated with the distinctive characteristics of the building through its construction and architecture, including having high artistic value or being the work of a master. The final criterion, D, "Information potential," is satisfied if the property has yielded or may be likely to yield information important to prehistory or history.<ref name=criteria>"[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/listing.htm Listing a Property: Some Frequently Asked Questions]," ''National Register of Historic Places'', Official site. Retrieved [[21 March]], [[2007]].</ref> The criteria are applied differently for different types of properties, for instance, maritime properties have different application guidelines than buildings.<ref name=bulletin/>

===Exclusions===
There are also specific instances where properties usually do not merit listing on the National Register. As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties which have achieved significance in the last 50 years are not qualified for listing on the Register.<ref name=criteria/> There are, however, exceptions to every category on that list and as such there are mitigating circumstances which allow for properties which fall into one of those groups to be included.<ref name=criteria/>

The section requires that the head of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction over a project which may effect a property listed on the National Register of Historic Places must first report to the Advisory Council. The head of said agency is required to "take into account the affect of the undertaking" on the National Register property as well as afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment.<ref name=gray>Gray, Oscar S.

In cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an "adverse effect" on historic properties, mitigation is sought.

The [[Title 49 of the United States Code|Department of Transportation Act]], passed on [[October 15]], [[1966]] - the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act - included language that dealt heavily with historic preservation. The language of the DOT Act is much broader than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties beyond those listed on the Register.<ref name=gray/>

The broader language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as [[protected area]]s under this legislation, a policy laid out early on in its history. In 1971, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the 1971 case "[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe]]." That ruling gave parklands the same protected status as "historic sites."<ref name=gray/>

===Multiple Property Submission===
[[Image:Ogle County White Pines Lodge3.JPG|thumb|right|The [[White Pines State Park Lodge and Cabins|lodge and cabins]] at [[White Pines State Park]], in [[Illinois]], are part of a Multiple Property Submission.]]
A Multiple Property Submission (MPS) is a thematic group listing in the National Register of Historic Places which consists of related properties. The properties are of a common theme and can be submitted as a group. The process begins with the Multiple Property Documentation Form, which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the NRHP. The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information outlined in the Multiple Property Documentation Form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously or, to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over a period of years. The actual nomination of individual properties in an MPS is done in the same manner other nominations are made. The name of the "thematic group" denotes the historical framework of the properties; it is considered the "multiple property listing." Once an individual or group of properties are nominated and listed on the NRHP the Multiple Property Documentation From, combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places Nomination Forms constitute a Multiple Property Submission.<ref name=mps>Lee, Antoinette J. and McClelland Linda F.

==Types of properties==
[[Image:National Register of Historic Places Property types collage.jpg|thumb|right|Clockwise from bottom left: a site, a building, a structure and an object. All examples of National Register of Historic Places property types.]]

{{see also|Property type (National Register of Historic Places)|Historic district (United States)}}
Listed properties generally fall into one of five categories, though there are special considerations for other types of properties which do not fit into these five broad categories or fit into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for NRHP properties are: building, structure, object, site, and district.<ref name=bulletin/> In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties.

Buildings, as defined by the National Register, are distinguished in the traditional sense. Examples include a [[house]], [[barn]], [[hotel]], [[church]] or similar construction. They are created primarily to shelter human activity. The term building, as in outbuilding, can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units, such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house.<ref name=bulletin/>

[[Image:SSJeremiahOBrien.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Liberty Ship]] [[SS Jeremiah O'Brien]], an example of a ship listed on the National Register. This ship is also a National Historic Landmark.]]

Structures differ from buildings, in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity. Examples include, an [[aircraft]], a [[grain elevator]], a [[gazebo]] and a [[bridge]]. Objects are usually artistic in nature, or small in scale when compared to structures and buildings. Though objects may be movable they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment. Examples of objects include, [[monument]]s, [[sculpture]]s and [[fountain]]s. Sites are the location of significant events which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities, buildings (standing, ruined or vanished). With sites it is the location itself which is of historical interest and it possesses cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures which may currently exist on the location. Examples of sites include, shipwrecks, [[battle]]fields, [[campsite]]s, natural features and [[rock shelter]]s.<ref name=bulletin/> Historic districts possess a concentration, linkage or continuity of the other four types of properties. Objects, structures, buildings and sites within a historic district are united historically or aesthetically, either by choice or by the nature of their development.<ref name=bulletin/>
 
There are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties on the National Register of Historic Places that do not fall into the categories with simple buildings and historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation against different types of properties.<ref name=bulletin/> Though the criteria are always the same, the way they are applied can differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins cover application of the criteria for: aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries and burial places, [[Property_type_%28National_Register_of_Historic_Places%29#Cultural_landscapes|historic designed landscape]]s, mining sites, [[post office]]s, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last 50 years, rural historic landscapes, [[Property_type_%28National_Register_of_Historic_Places%29#Traditional_cultural_properties|traditional cultural properties]], and vessels and shipwrecks.<ref name=bulletin/>

In 1983 Joseph A. Tainter and G. John Lucas published "Epistemology of the Significance Concept," in ''American Antiquity''. The paper dealt with the notion of significance and the "dilemma" it presented concerning which properties were included on the NRHP and which ones were not. The main idea underlying Lucas' and Tainter's paper was the quest for a "deeper understanding" of the notion of significance as it pertained to historic preservation efforts in the United States. Through that deeper understanding they hoped to "suggest possible courses of action for dealing with some aspects of the significance dilemma."<ref name=tainter/> The two criticized the idea of significance as it was applied by the NRHP, stating that three of the criteria for inclusion basically defined significance as "significant."

Rogers, appeared in ''The Public Historian'' and criticized the lack of a "human touch" in the way the program was administered by the National Park Service, which was, according to the author, in a highly decentralized fashion. The same paper noted the lack of training that federal historic preservation officers received.<ref name=Rogers>Rogers, Jerry L.
