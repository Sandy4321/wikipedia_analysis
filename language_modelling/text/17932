"'''Push the Button'''" is a song by English girl group the [[Sugababes]], released as the [[lead single]] from their fourth studio album ''[[Taller in More Ways]]'' (2005). Composed by [[Dallas Austin]] and the Sugababes, it was inspired by an infatuation that group member [[Keisha Buchanan]] developed with another artist. "Push the Button" is an [[electropop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with various computer effects. The lyrical content regards a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man.

The song received positive reviews from critics, who praised its conception and production. Some critics named it one of best pop singles of the 2000s. "Push the Button" became one of the group's most commercially successful releases. The single peaked at number one in Austria, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, and reached the top five across Europe and in Australia. It was nominated for [[2006 BRIT Awards#The Awards|Best British Single]] at the [[2006 BRIT Awards]].

[[Matthew Rolston]] directed the song's [[music video]], which was filmed in [[Shepherds Bush]], [[London]]. It features the Sugababes flirting with three men in an elevator. The Sugababes performed the single at festivals and events such as [[Oxegen 2008]] and the [[V Festival|V Festival 2008]]. "Push the Button" appears on the soundtrack to ''[[It's a Boy Girl Thing]]'' (2006) and is featured on a commercial for [[Tassimo]] [[coffee machine]]s. The song was parodied by firefighters based in [[Staffordshire]], England.

==Development and concept==

Development of "Push the Button" began while the Sugababes travelled to the United States to work on their fourth studio album, ''[[Taller in More Ways]]'' (2005).<ref name="Guardian Interview">{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/sep/16/fashion.shopping|title=Jess Cartner-Morley meets the Sugababes|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News & Media]]|date=16 September 2005|accessdate=3 April 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69jzjMwd4|archivedate=7 August 2012}}</ref> American producer and songwriter [[Dallas Austin]] collaborated with the group during the album's initial stages of development.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lyons|first1=Beverley|last2=Fullerton|first2=Le-Ann|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-123030595.html|title=Showbuzz|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=9 October 2004|accessdate=5 February 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref> He visited London to work with them,<ref name="Liverpool Echo">{{cite news|last=Collinson|first=Dawn|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-136598318.html|title=There's no way the Babes are going to split|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=Trinity Mirror|date=23 September 2005|accessdate=15 January 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref> although the group later travelled to the US and stayed with him at his mansion in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.<ref name="Guardian Interview"/> Austin wrote five tracks for the album, including "Push the Button', which he composed in collaboration with the Sugababes.<ref name="Liverpool Echo"/> According to group member [[Heidi Range]], the song was "the very last thing" completed for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/music/265493-sugababes-more-personal-album/|title=Sugababes' more personal album|work=''[[STV (TV network)|STV]]''|publisher=[[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]]|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=11 May 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6DjDOuArk|archivedate=17 January 2013}}</ref> 

"Push the Button" was conceptualised after group member [[Keisha Buchanan]] developed an infatuation with another artist who was collaborating with Austin.<ref name="Guardian Interview"/> Buchanan told Jess Cartner-Morley of ''[[The Guardian]]'' that she made advances towards the man, but he was unaware of her intentions: "I really liked this guy, so I'd be like, there's this good movie coming out, you know, dropping hints. And he'd be like, that movie sounds great, let me know what it's like if you go see it. I knew he liked me too but he just wasn't getting what I was trying to say."<ref name="Guardian Interview"/> Austin advised Buchanan to tell the man to "push that button" or she would eventually move on.<ref name="Guardian Interview"/> 

[[Mutya Buena]], another member of the Sugababes, clarified Buchanan's encounter with the artist to ''[[Hot Press]]'' magazine's Jackie Hayden, saying: "We all knew there was something going on between them at the time, but we try to give each other space."<ref name="Hot Press"/> She described "Push the Button" as a song "with meaning and real life references", and characterised it as having a "street vibe".<ref name="Sugababes"/> Austin produced the song, which was recorded at DARP Studios in Atlanta & Home Recordings, London.<ref name="liner notes"/> "Push the Button" was [[Mixing (music production)|mixed]] by Jeremy Wheatley at TwentyOne Studios, London, in collaboration with Richard Edgeler.<ref name="liner notes"/> Rick Shepphard [[Engineering (music)|engineered]] the song.<ref name="liner notes"/>
