'''Luis Rolando Arrojo Avila''' (born [[July 18]], [[1968]] in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]) was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] who pitched from [[1998]] to [[2002]].

Arrojo made his mark with the teams from [[Villa Clara (baseball team)|Villa Clara]] in the [[Cuban National Series]], where he still is the all-time leader in hit batsmen. He was the staff ace on the Villa Clara team that won 3 consecutive Cuban National Series in [[1993]], [[1994]], and [[1995]].  He was a member of the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympic]] team that won the [[gold medal]].

A [[1994]] Cuban baseball card gives his birthplace as San Juan de los Yeras, Villa Clara, [[May 29]], [[1964]].

After defecting from the Cuban national team just before the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Arrojo signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in [[1997]] -- one year before the team started playing, as that expansion team (along with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]) was permitted to start and maintain a [[minor league]] system starting that year.  He made his debut with the expansion Devil Rays in [[1998]] and was an immediate sensation, becoming the team's first All-Star.  He finished 1998 with a strong (for the team that went 63-99) 14-12 record and a 3.56 [[Earned Run Average|ERA]] in 202 innings.

However, in [[1999]], with teams and hitters more familiar with him and with his developing health problems (as critics claimed, these health problems were due to a lack of condition by Arrojo and his refusal to listen to coaches), Arrojo's numbers began to deteriorate, and he showed signs of inability to get left-handed hitters out.  He pitched just 140.2 innings with a 5.18 ERA.  After the season, the Devil Rays traded him to the [[Colorado Rockies]] with [[Aaron Ledesma]] for [[Vinny Castilla]].  Late in [[2000]], the Rockies in turn traded him with [[Rick Croushore]], [[Mike Lansing]], and cash to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for [[Jeff Frye]], [[Brian Rose (baseball player)|Brian Rose]], [[John Wasdin]], and minor leaguer Jeff Taglienti.  Arrojo spent the rest of the season in the Red Sox rotation but was largely ineffective.  He then spent the following two seasons as a part-time starter and a part-time reliever for the Red Sox with moderate success.  He was not re-signed after the [[2002]] season.

In his career, Arrojo finished with a 4.55 ERA in 700 innings.
