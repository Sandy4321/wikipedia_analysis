==History==
===Background===
Shortly before completing his contract with [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in May of 1961, John Coltrane joined the newly formed [[Impulse! Records|Impulse!]] label, with whom the "[[John_coltrane#Classic_Quartet_period_.281962.E2.80.931965.29|Classic Quartet]]" would record. It is generally assumed that the clinching reason Coltrane signed with Impulse! was that it would enable him to work again with recording engineer [[Rudy Van Gelder]],<ref>Porter 1999, pp. 197-198.</ref>  who had taped his [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] sessions, as well as ''[[Blue Train (album)|Blue Train]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.gov/national/jazz/jmCMS/master.php?id=2009_05 |title=NEA Jazz Masters: RVG |publisher=National Endowment for the Arts |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> It was at Van Gelder's new studio in [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ|Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] that Coltrane would record most of his records for the label, including the recordings featured on ''Coltrane for Lovers''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzdisco.org/john-coltrane/discography/session-index/ |title=John Coltrane Discography - session index |publisher=Jazz Discography Project  |accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref>

During this period, critics were fiercely divided in their estimation of Coltrane, who had radically altered his style from [[bebop]] to the [[Modal jazz|modal]] and [[free jazz]] styles featured on ''[[Coltrane (Impulse! album)|Coltrane]]'', his first studio project for the Impulse! label. John Tynan of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine went so far as to call his playing "anti-jazz".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=212 |title=''Down Beat'' - Coltrane and Dolphy answer critics |publisher=Maher Publications |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> In the midst of this controversy, Coltrane decided to release his next three albums in order to improve the critical perception of him.<ref name=RollingStone.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/johncoltrane/biography |title=John Coltrane biography |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> Coltrane's producer [[Bob Thiele]] acknowledged that the next three Coltrane albums to be released were to be recorded at his behest and as ballad-themed to quiet the critics of Coltrane's more diverse playing. When asked why he was recording ballads album, Coltrane responded, "''Variety''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist/releases/default.aspx?pid=9493&aid=2660 |title=Coltrane - Ballads - Impulse! |publisher=Verve Music Group  |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>

===Recordings===
''[[Ballads (John Coltrane album)|Ballads]]'', recorded in late 1961 and 1962, was at first criticized as predictable and too simple after the aggressiveness Coltrane displayed on his previous recordings, but was later reevaluated favorably,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:azfoxqtgldfe |title=Ballads > Overview |publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> by some as a masterpiece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=7909 |title=AllAboutJazz.com - Ballads: Remembering John Coltrane |publisher=All About Jazz |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> On the next album, ''[[Duke Ellington and John Coltrane]]'', [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]] "sat in" with the John Coltrane Quartet for a set dominated by the pianist's songs. Some performances had his usual sidemen, bassist [[Aaron Bell]] and drummer [[Sam Woodyard]], replacing [[Jimmy Garrison]] and [[Elvin Jones]] in the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wc10.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dzftxqugldhe |title=Duke Ellington & John Coltrane > Overview |publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> ''[[John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman]]'' found the "classic quartet" backing up the smooth torch singer on ballad standards. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' later described the album as "''....one of Coltrane<U+2019>s least innovative records, but impeccably dignified and elegant''"<ref name=RollingStone.com/> and music critic Richard S. Ginell commented by saying that "''....Coltrane<U+2019>s eloquence and the warm, masculine baritone of Hartman can still break your heart''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzstandards.com/compositions-0/myoneandonlylove.htm |title=Jazz Standards - My One and Only Love: CD Recommendations for This Tune |publisher=JazzStandards.com |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> Shortly after, Coltrane would return to a more experimental phase, releasing ''[[Impressions (album)|Impressions]]'' in 1963 and ''[[A Love Supreme]]'' in 1965, but it would be these recordings that would give John Coltrane a place in romantic jazz.<ref>Porter 1999, pp. 224-226.</ref>

===Reception===
Compiling eleven of the recordings from this period seen best fit for a romance-themed compilation, ''Coltrane for Lovers'' was issued by the [[Verve Music Group]], the current distributing label of Impulse! Released in January of 2001, 33 years after Coltrane's death and nearly 40 years after the original recording dates, the album entered the [[Top Jazz Albums]] chart on [[February 10]], [[2001]] and peaked at #5.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:h9ftxqe0ldde~T3 |title=Coltrane for Lovers > Charts and Awards |publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref> It remained on the chart for 83 weeks, until [[February 1]], [[2003]], nearly two years after entering the chart.<ref name=billboard/>

Upon release, ''Coltrane for Lovers'' was generally well-received by critics.<ref name=times>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E7D7133CF934A35751C1A9679C8B63 |title=Holiday Forecast: Cool to Sultry, and a Chance of CD Flurries; Compilations, Live Albums And Reissues - By BEN RATLIFF - Published: December 7, 2001 |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> Music critic Alex Henderson of [[Allmusic.com]] described the album as "''....an excellent collection that has no problem reminding us just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be.''"<ref name=allmusic.com/> After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a [[December 21]], [[2001]] article for ''[[The New York Times]]'', writer Ben Ratliff wrote that, "This collection... presents all the argument you need."<ref name=times/> Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation.<ref name=Coltrane_Lovers/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzitude.com/bllivetrane.htm |title=John Coltrane; Live Trane |publisher=Jazzitude, Marshall Bowden |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> In a 2007 interview for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, author and Coltrane biographer Ben Ratliff explained his view on the importance of Coltrane's music and balladry: 

<blockquote>
{{cquote|His work contains most of the well-known ideals of jazz.... If you<U+2019>re interested in improvisation, this guy pushed improvisation to the wall. He was the best blues player of his time. He wrote and played incredible ballads. Record companies are still putting out compilations of Coltrane ballads called ''Coltrane for Lovers'' or whatever. You can poke fun at the idea, but if you ever listen to one, they<U+2019>re indescribably beautiful.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/fiction/book-review/coltrane |title=John Coltrane Biography - Esquire |publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc. |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>|Ben Ratliff|color=blue|size=50%}}
</blockquote>

A similar compilation, entitled ''Plays for Lovers'', was released by [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:dvftxqr5ldfe~T21 |title=John Coltrane > Discography > Compilations|publisher=All Media Guide, LLC. |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Another Verve compilation of Coltrane ballads, entitled ''More Coltrane for Lovers'', followed in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/artist/releases/default.aspx?pid=11317&aid=2660 |title=Verve Music Group - More Coltrane for Lovers |publisher=Verve Music Group |accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>
