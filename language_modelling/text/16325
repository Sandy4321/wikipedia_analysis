Cada became a representative of [[PokerStars#Team_PokerStars|Team PokerStars]] in 2009 in the weeks prior to becoming World Champion. 

By winning the Main Event at the age of 21, Cada surpassed [[Peter Eastgate]] as the youngest champion ever. Cada had two previous WSOP cash wins, both in 2009. Cada had been a regular [[online poker]] player for several years prior to winning the live WSOP event. He is primarily an online poker player, with more than $500,000 in online tournament winnings at present.<ref>[http://www.pocketfives.com/profiles/jcada99 Pocketfives.com: Joseph Cada profile]</ref> As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings exceed $8,550,000.<ref name=JCthm/>  

He is from a family of card enthusiasts although his parents disapproved of his chosen profession.  His agent dubbed him "The Kid" and he has also taken on the role as a stateman of the profession in the media and political circles, where he is a proponent of legalization of gambling.

In the ''Time'' interview, Cada expressed his thoughts on legislation related to the legality of gambling: "I support the right to play poker online. Poker isn't gambling.
