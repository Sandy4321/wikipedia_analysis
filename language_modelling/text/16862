The '''Church of the Poor Clares dedicated to [[Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]''' (initially dedicated to the Holy Spirit, St. Adalbert, St.Clare and St. Barbara) is an historic [[church (building)|church]] in Gdanska Street, [[Bydgoszcz]], Poland.
{{break|2}}

== Location ==
The church stands in a prominent location at the junction of the Gdanska Street, the Mostowa Street, Jagiellonska Street and the Focha Street in downtown Bydgoszcz.

{{break|1}}

=== Origins of the church ===
The origins of the church are associated with the arrival in 1615 of the sisters of the [[Poor Clares|Order of Saint Clare]] in [[Bydgoszcz]]. On the place chosen by the Poor Clares, was originally standing an [[:pl:Ko<U+015B>ci<U+00F3><U+0142> stary <U+015A>w. Ducha w Bydgoszczy|oak built hospital church]] dedicated to the Holy Spirit, funded by the citizens of Bydgoszcz in 1448. In 1522, decision was made to build a brick church on this place, but the actual work started only in 1582.<ref name="BPA">Bartoszy<U+0144>ska-Potemska Albina: Dzieje i architektura ko<U+015B>cio<U+0142>a i klasztoru Klarysek w Bydgoszczy. [w.] Prace komisji sztuki t. I: Bydgoskie Towarzystwo Naukowe. Prace Wydzia<U+0142>u Nauk Humanistycznych. Seria D: 1965</ref>

The construction of the new church used the superstructure of the hospital church standing here. Building the walls took approximately 8 years (until 1590), the interiors were completed in 1602. From, 1602 to 1618, no work was done.  . It was only in 1615 after the establishment of the  Convent of the Poor Clares in Bydgoszcz and a donation by the city council in 1616 of a land on the outskirts of Gdansk, that things really started. First were constructed the [[nave]] then the former Holy Spirit's church became the base of the new churxh's [[Chancel|choir]]. As a result, the new entrance of the church, much larger than the former one, was an ogival [[arch]], joining the [[Chancel|choir]] to the nave.<ref name="BPA"/>

Over the years, the church has been enlarged  according to the needs of the sisters: hence the superstructure of the [[sacristy]] in the choir. In 1636, an altar funded by Anna Modlibogowa, from of [[Kruszyn, Bydgoszcz County|Kruszyn]], has been installed. The consecration of the enlarged church of the Holy Spirit happened on 21 September 1645; the ceremony was chaired by [[suffragan bishop]] Piotr Mieszkowski from W<U+0142>oc<U+0142>awek, assisted by the abbot of the Cistercian abbey of Koronowo.<ref name="KKB">Ko<U+015B>ci<U+00F3><U+0142> katolicki w Bydgoszczy. Kalendarium. Praca zbiorowa. Autorzy: Borodij Eugeniusz, Chamot Marek, Kabaci<U+0144>ski Ryszard, Kutta Janusz, Pastuszewski Stefan</ref> New patrons were then added, [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Wojciech]], [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] and [[Saint Barbara]].
In addition, inside the altar were sealed [[relic]]s of:
* [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Wojciech]],
* [[Saint Barbara]],
* Rufin and [[Perpetua and Felicity|Perpetua of Carthage]] ([[Christian martyrs]]).

In 1646, the church has been adorned in the priests [[Chapel]] with a rich, [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] attic and a [[crypt]] for nuns, both offered by the mayor of Bydgoszcz, Wojciech <U+0141>ochowski; this chapel still exists today. New elements in the interior have been put in: in 1651, a grid iron separating the [[chancel]] from the nave, and in 1661 a tombstone plaque of Sophia Smoszewska -founder of sisters' monastery in Bydgoszcz.<ref name="BPA"/>

The monastery and its church had at this time a strategic location, on the road from the Carmelite monastery (now demolished) in the North and continuing through the bridge leading to the Old City of Bydgoszcz.
This fact explained that around 1740, a multi storey [[tower]] topped with a [[baroque]] [[spire]] has been erected in the south-west corner of the nave.<ref name="BK">Bartowski Krzysztof: Najstarszy ko<U+015B>ci<U+00F3><U+0142> szpitalny w Bydgoszczy, a klasztor ss.

Bydgoszcz 2002</ref> Slits on the lower levels were adjusted to be allow the use of [[firearms]].

In 1730, funds donated by Helen Zkoraczewsk<U+0105> Z<U+0142>otnicka helped to rebuild all the windows in the church, and in 1746 a porch with 2 entrances was added (no traces today). 
{{break|1}}

=== Church as seen from a visit in 1760. ===
In a detailed visit made in 1760, [[Diocese of Inflanty|Livonian]] bishop [[Antoni Kazimierz Ostrowski]] reported that the church was all in brick and covered with Polish [[tile]]s. Adjacent were two [[Sacristy|sacristies]] for priests and sisters, a [[porch]] church and a [[tower]] covered with a dome. On the tower were suspended two silver [[church bell|bells]] and another in the [[fl<U+00E8>che]]. Inside, there were two [[Matroneum|galleries]] and the nave was covered with decorated, [[polychrome]] wooden ceiling, which can are still be admired today.

In the chancel was a large, gilded altar with two paintings: the coronation of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] at the bottom and [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] at the top. Besides the main one, there were seven side altars dedicated to:
* [[Saint Ursula]] - altar from 1736. This was associated with the St. Ursula brotherhood, which in 1751 got permission to celebrate prayers, on certain days of the year, giving [[indulgence]s] for the deliverance of souls from [[purgatory]],<ref name="KKB"/>
*  The [[holy spirit]] - the original patron of the temple,
* [[Catherine of Siena]],
* [[Mary of Nazareth|Blessed Virgin Mary]] from [[Cz<U+0119>stochowa]],
* [[Guardian Angel|Holy Guardian Angels]] - they were associated with the church brotherhood,
* [[Saint Joseph]],
* [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]].

The church had a large [[Matroneum|gallery]] supported by [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], on the walls were 21 windows and 34 images. The chancel had a floor in flagstones, and the nave in bricks.

At the high altar are two tombs, Sophia Smoszewska's and Rozdra<U+017C>ewskiej's (her niece). In the crypt under [[Catherine of Siena]]'s altar is the tomb of monastery's [[Abbot|abbess]] and below the priests sacristy are tombs of the other nuns.

Items observed included: church bells, [[Roman Missal|missals]], books, [[monstrance]], [[chalice]]s, [[cruet]]s, [[cross]]es, [[candlestick]]s, lamps, dresses, votives, [[chasuble]]s, covers, [[alb]]s, [[surplice]]s and [[belt]]s.

=== The period of the Prussian partition ===
In 1835, with the [[secularization]] of both monastery and church,  Poor Clares were resettled to [[Gniezno]]. The buildings was transferred to the city, and by decision of [[Eduard Heinrich von Flottwell]], governor of [[Grand Duchy of Posen]], church worship was to be abandoned and the interior to be used for other purposes.

Interior objects were dispersed among other churches:
* Main altar was transferred to a church in [[Sypniewo, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sypniewo]],
* One side altar was sent to [[Osielsko]],
* Gate iron grille was moved to Starofarny Cemetery in Bydgoszcz,
* One of the side altars and Sophia Smoszewska's tombstone was moved to Bydgoszcz cathedral (St. Martin and St. Nicholas).

The secularised building of the church was used for diverse purposes.
Initially a store was installed: part of the western chancel (with the former [[Matroneum|gallery]]) was isolated and refitted, an opening was made through the southern wall for a warehouse.

In June 1848, a severe storm knocked down the metal structure of the [[Tented roof|tower]]. A year later it was replaced by a lower roof. In June 1863 the building housed the Cleaning Department of Streets and latrines. Then, in 1875, in the building was installed a [[fire station]], with space for firefighting cars and stables. 
Successive refittings strongly interfered in the primary structure of architectural interiors and exteriors. Western and southern walls of the nave endured beared large holes for gates, large opening doors were created in a southern chapel, and to the east was built a low building with a flat pseudo [[merlon]]ed roof. Inside, significant renovations  were performed:<ref name="JA">Jankowski Aleksander. Ko<U+015B>ci<U+00F3><U+0142> Klarysek pod wezwaniem Wniebowzi<U+0119>cia Naj<U+015B>wi<U+0119>tszej Marii Panny w Bydgoszczy.

* [[Arch]]es were bricked,
* chancel was divided into two floors, creating an apartment upstairs for commander,
* Part of window openings were liquidated, some reduced,
* Opening window of the Chapel <U+0141>ochowski became a door, leading to a decorated [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] with a view on the roof,
* Two-storey sacristy was separated by an indoor roof, and converted as a [[Stairs|stairwell]],
* The nave was adapted to ease movements and transport.

In 1888, the Historical Society of [[Netze District]] in Bydgoszcz made available the chancel for exhibition purposes. The exhibition of historical collections started in 1890, and imposed an external [[Stairs|stairwell]] to be erected on northern wall. In the following years,  the Historical Society of [[Netze District]] planned and systematically carried out conservation actions. Around 1900 was built a ceiling with joists in the nave, and 1901 a clock with two dial plates was mounted on the [[tower]] and a [[Baroque]] pink cupola reconstructed. Initially, the 1897 project should take a modest form but eventually, urban architect Carl Meyer, with the help of Prussian conservator J. Kothe, changed the design, 1844 using drawing of Ferdinand von Quastof. Once completed, the church was the pride of [[Bydgoszcz|Bromberg]] city center.<ref name="BK" />

In 1911, the Fire Brigade received a new headquarters in Bydgoszcz and moved out. Idea was raised to transform the buildings into a [[prison]]: the members of the Historical Society of [[Netze District]] have strived to grant sanctuary for museum purposes.<ref name="JA"/> During [[World War I]], the basement of the chancel has housed [[:pl:Pogotowie ratunkowe|emergency medical service]], in the nave were stored benches and postal supplies.<ref name="JA"/>

=== [[History of Poland (1918<U+2013>39)|Interwar period]] ===
After Poland regained independence in 1920, the church was transferred back to sacred purposes. Between 1920 and 1922, a complete renovation has been carried out, originally designed by the architect Kazimierz Ulatowski, and later under the direction of Stefan Cybichowski from [[Poznan]]:<ref name="BK"/>
* External additions of Prussian outbuildings were demolished, 
* [[Buttress]] in the north-west corner of nave was reconstructed,
* A [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance]]-style restoration of priest sacristy was conducted without great success, distorting the original stylistic character,
* The interior walls and the chancel floorwere removed,
* A restoration of arches, windows patterns, doorways have been performed,
* Walls were reinforced with a new [[plaster]] and the ceiling secured.

In 1922, a new facade [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] has been built by Jakub Job, according to the project of Stefan Cybichowski. After renovation, the church interior has gained new equipment, including an altar from a Poznan workshop Roman, new benches, [[choir|stalls]], [[kneeler]]s, [[confessional]] s and a [[pulpit]] realized using older sculptural elements. On the [[Matroneum]] has been mounted a six scale [[organ]].<ref name="JA"/>

The second [[consecration]] of the church happened on 3 December 1922. The ceremony has been conducted by Consecrated by Cardinal [[Edmund Dalbor]], [[List of archbishops of Gniezno and primates of Poland|Archbishop]] of Gniezno and Poznan, assisted by [[Antoni Laubitz]], and the pastor of the parish church in Bydgoszcz, brother Tadeusz Skarbek-Malczewski. The church was a [[filial church]] of Bydgoszcz's Cathedral and the office of youth ministry.<ref name="JA"/>

On 16 November 16, 1925, another ceremony of [[consecration]] occurred to "re-grant" St. Clare's church to the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], celebrated by [[suffragan bishop]] of Gniezno [[Antoni Laubitz]]. Prior to the ceremony, the interior received a new plaster, and Henryk Jackowski decorated the walls with [[fresco]]es. Inside the church, several works of [[easel|painting]]s were also created, including:<ref name="JA"/>
* [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]] by Kazimiery Pajzderskiej,
* Ste [[Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se of Lisieux]] and [[Black Madonna of Cz<U+0119>stochowa|Our Lady of Cz<U+0119>stochowa]] by Henryk Jackowski,
* [[St. Stanislaus Kostka]] by- [[Leon Wycz<U+00F3><U+0142>kowski]] (dedicated by the artist to school students in Bydgoszcz).
In 1933, a plaque has been mounted on the facade of the church in honor of Polish kings [[Stephen B<U+00E1>thory]] and [[John III Sobieski]], designed and executed by Bydgoszcz artists Piotr Triebler and Andrzej Gajewski. This work was destroyed by the Germans in 1939r.<ref name="JA"/>
On 3 March 1931, the Church of the Poor Clares was inscribed in the Register of Architectural Monuments of [[Second Polish Republic]] as one of the four oldest churches in Bydgoszcz.<ref name="BK"/>
{{break|1}}

=== Since 1939 ===
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] the church was still available for worship, but in March 1941, Nazi occupying forces closed the building. Overall restoration work was undertaken in 1950, and this still sets the appearance of today's church.

This work included, inter alia, partial roofing, renovation of fa<U+00E7>ade near the summit, changes to the window openings and veneering of the facade. During those works a sensational discovery has been made under the floor of the nave, where  a grave [[Megalith]] with [[urn]]s from 500 BC has been unearthed. 
In 1952, while scraping out internal plaster ], relics of the four have been revealed in the chancel four embedded crosses ({{pl}}" Zacheuszek") probably from the time of 1st consecration of the church in 1645. This year was transferred the gravestone of Sophia Smoszewska, the first [[Prior|abbess]], from the [[porch]] to the northern chancel.

In 1954, an 12-scaled [[organ]], from one of the Protestant temples, has replaced the former one dating from the 1920s, which has been moved to [[Osiek, Gmina Koronowo|Osiek]] church.<ref name="JA"/> From 1953 to 1954, several conservation works have been carried out under the supervision of professor Leonard Torwirt from [[Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru<U+0144>]], focusing on:
* [[Polychrome]]d roof of the nave, 
* Tower stairs leading to the chancel gallery,
* Painting [[Jude the Apostle]] by brush Edward Kwiatkowski.
In 1955, on an arch wall has been unveiled a preserved XVII<sup>th</sup> century fresco, as well as bricked [[oculus|oculi]] on the northern and southern walls of the naves, which have restored two years later.

An important step of the refurbishing has been, in 1955, to get back the original XVII<sup>th</sup> century main altar from [[Sypniewo, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Sypniewo]]. Its return was preceded by many years of efforts from the rector of the church, brother Gierzy<U+0144>ski, supported by the written consent of [[Primate of Poland]] [[Stefan Wyszynski]]. It has been inserted back to its original place, where was originally displayed the painting [[Coronation of the Virgin]] with attires of [[Order of Saint Clare|Poor Clares]]. However, the picture was so decayed that even before the altar restitution,it has been replaced by the image of the "Madonna Apocalyptic" (cir. 1900). Among the other artefacts returned to the church were the forged iron grille separating the chancel from the nave, dating back to the secularization of the church, and temporarely installed on the gate of Starofarny Cemetery in Bydgoszcz and the grating of the sacristy of priests (later the chapel of St. Teresa, and now chapel of Our Lady of Czestochowa).<ref name="JA"/>

In 1957, [[stained glass]] was installed in the chancel, following the design of Zdzislaw Kuligowski. 1958 repairs and restoration treatments completed the post-war process of overall renovation of the church. In the mid-1960s the old [[Zinc|galvanized steel]] cover of the spire was replaced and in the nave was fixed a [[Majolica]] [[Stations of the Cross]].<ref name="JA"/>

In 1971, due to the need to modernize the streets in downtown [[Bydgoszcz]], an option discussed was shifting the church of St. Clare to the place of the building of the monastery, which would be demolished. But another solution came out, which guaranteed the preservation of both monuments<ref name="JMB">Janiszewska-Mincer Barbara. Z dziej<U+00F3>w klasztoru i ko<U+015B>cio<U+0142>a Klarysek. [w.] Kalendarz Bydgoski 1985</ref>

A restoration work on [[polychrome]]d ceiling and wall paintings has been performed from 1987 to 1989, and an other in the early 1990s.<ref name="JA"/> In 1991 began the restoration work of the main altar, and the plaster covering of chancel walls and [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]], removing old [[stucco]] from 1920s and revealing original primary colors<ref name="BK"/>

=== Parish ===
Since [[World War II]], the church has received higher titles:<ref name="BK"/> 
* In 1951, rector's church,
* In 1972, academic church by decree of [[Primate of Poland]] [[Stefan Wyszy<U+0144>ski]], 
* In 1983, it ceased to be a subsidiary of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Martin and Nicholas in Bydgoszcz.

From 13  November 1993, the pastoral work of the church has been conducted by   the [[order of Friars Minor Capuchin]] f

== Architecture ==
The Church of the Poor Clares survived to the present day as an [[Orientation of churches|eastward]] facing church, with an elongated nave with three sides closed chancel, which adjoins the sacristy and a chapel. This church harmoniously combines elements of different architectural styles, [[Polish Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque in Poland|Baroque]]<ref name="HB">Biskup Marian red.: Historia Bydgoszczy. Tom I do roku 1920. Warszawa-Pozna<U+0144>: Bydgoskie Towarzystwo Naukowe, 1991</ref>

The oldest walls in the northern part of the chancel date from 1582.<ref name="JA" /> The architecture of the church was established in reference to an older church, the Bernardine Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace in Bydgoszcz. Attics of the priests chapel are the best Renaissance elements of the building

=== Chancel ===
The church's chancel possesses [[vault]]s with [[lunette]]s, covered with a mesh of arches. It gives the illusion of cross-arched vaults as in medieval buildings, but this network does not play any structural role, it's only a decorative element.<ref name="BPA"/> In the chancel, in addition to semicircular windows, there are oculi: these are [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] architectural elements, typical of the churches erected in the early XVII<sup>th</sup> century.
{{break|1}}

=== Nave ceiling ===
The nave of the church is covered with wooden, [[polychrome]]d ceiling from with the first half of XVII<sup>th</sup> century, a complex of 112 [[coffer]]s endorned with painted [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]] and symbolic characters. 103 [[coffer]]s' [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]] are filled with stylized petals, the 9 remaining symbols are associated with the cult of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]], [[Jesus]] and [[mendicant orders]]. The canopy refers to [[Middle Agesl]] tradition, although it uses  [[Renaissance]] elements.<ref name="BPA"/>
{{break|1}}

=== Western [[gable]] ===
The western [[gable]] has got plastered openings - similar to those that can be seen in Bydgoszcz Cathedral or those present in the bygone St. Mary's Church of the Carmelites in Bydgoszcz. It is divided into [[cornice]]s and [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and decorated with [[volute]]s, [[obelisk]]s and [[globe]]s<ref name="BPA"/>
{{break|1}}

=== Tower ===
On the north-west corner of the church structure stands a circular [[church tower|tower]], with confers a sturd and unusual silhouette to the whole building. The upper part is octagonal, topped by a [[steeple]] ending with a [[roof lantern]]. The tower houses a [[stairs]], allowing to access the [[matroneum]] of the nave.
{{break|1}}

=== [[Matroneum]] ===
Located on the back of the nave, it is supported by four massive columns.
{{break|1}}

=== Chapel <U+0141>ochowski ===
The priests chapel's roof is topped with a [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] attic. The wall of the [[parapet]] is composed of a fragmented double arcade. The attic of priests chapel is similar in its structure to the attic of the city hall in Tarn<U+00F3>w, and it is close to the XVI<sup>th</sup> century Ko<U+015B>cielecki chapel of St. Margaret church in [[Ko<U+015B>cielec, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Ko<U+015B>cielec]].<ref name="BPA"/>
{{break|1}}

=== Interior ===
Inside the temple are many masterpieces, including:
* The main altar (1636), [[Mannerism|mannerist]] style, richly decorated, with painting "[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary]]" by George Hoppen from [[Toru<U+0144>]](cir. 1955),
* "St. Stanislaus Kostka" brush painting by [[Leon Wycz<U+00F3><U+0142>kowski]],
