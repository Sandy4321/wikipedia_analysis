}}'''Elisabeth K<U+00FC>bler-Ross, M.D.''' (July 8, 1926 &ndash; August 24, 2004) was a [[Swiss American]] [[psychiatrist]], a pioneer in [[Near-death studies]] and the author of the groundbreaking book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' (1969), where she first discussed what is now known as the [[K<U+00FC>bler-Ross model]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,689491,00.html|title= Milestones |date=Aug. 30, 2004  |publisher=TIME | first=Sarah M. | last=Broom}}</ref>  

She is a 2007 inductee into the [[United States|American]] [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&id=222|title=Women of the Hall : Elisabeth K<U+00FC>bler-Ross|publisher=Official website}}</ref> She was the recipient of twenty honorary degrees and by July 1982 had taught, in her estimation, 125,000 students in death and dying courses in colleges, seminaries, medical schools, hospitals, and social-work institutions.<ref>''Turn on, tune in, drop dead'' by Ron Rosenbaum, HARPER'S, July 1982, pages 32-42</ref> In 1970, she delivered the [[The Ingersoll Lectures on Human Immortality]] at [[Harvard University]], on the theme, ''On Death and Dying''.

==Birth and education==
Elisabeth K<U+00FC>bler was born on July 8, 1926  in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]], [[Switzerland]], one of [[multiple birth|triplet]]s.  Elisabeth was born fifteen minutes before her identical sister, Erika.  Minutes later came her sister, Eva.<ref>Newman, Laura. [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/329/7466/627.pdf Elisabeth K<U+00FC>bler-Ross]. (2004). ''British Medical Journal, 329 (7466),''  627. Retrieved November 17, 2006.</ref> Her family were Protestant Christians. Her father did not want her to study medicine, but she persisted.  Eventually her father took pride in her career. In an interview she stated: ''In Switzerland I was educated in line with the basic premise: work work work. You are only a valuable human being if you work. This is utterly wrong. Half working, half dancing - that is the right mixture. I myself have danced and played too little."''<ref>[[:de:Elisabeth K<U+00FC>bler-Ross|de.wikipedia]]</ref> 

During [[World War II]] she became involved in refugee relief work in [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] and later visited [[Majdanek]] death camp. She graduated from the [[University of Z<U+00FC>rich]] medical school in 1957.

==Academic career==
She moved to the United States in 1958 to work and continue her studies in New York.

As she began her psychiatric residency, she was appalled by the hospital treatment of patients who were dying. She began giving a series of lectures featuring terminally ill patients, forcing medical students to confront people who were dying.  

In 1962 she accepted a position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] School of Medicine. K<U+00FC>bler-Ross completed her training in psychiatry in 1963, and moved to Chicago in 1965.  She became an instructor at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Pritzker School of Medicine]]. She developed there a series of seminars using interviews with terminal patients, which drew both praise and criticism. She sometimes questioned the practices of traditional [[psychiatry]] that she observed. She also undertook 39 months of classical [[psychoanalysis]] training in Chicago.

Her extensive work with the dying led to the book ''[[On Death and Dying]]'' in 1969. In this work she proposed the now famous [[Five Stages of Grief]] as a pattern of adjustment. These five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. In general, individuals experience most of these stages, though in no defined sequence, after being faced with the reality of their impending death. The five stages have since been adopted by many as applying to the survivors of a loved one's death, as well.

K<U+00FC>bler-Ross encouraged the [[hospice care]] movement, believing that euthanasia prevents people from completing their 'unfinished business'.

In 1977 she persuaded her husband to buy forty acres of land in [[Escondido, California]], near San Diego, where she founded "[[Shanti Nilaya]]" (Home of Peace). She intended it as a healing center for the dying and their families. She was also a co-founder of the American Holistic Medical Association.  

In the late 1970s K<U+00FC>bler-Ross became interested in [[out-of-body experiences]], [[mediumship]], [[spiritualism]] and in other ways attempting to contact the dead. This led to a scandal connected to the Shanti Nilaya healing center where she was duped by the medium [[Jay Barham]], founder of the Church of the Facet of the Divinity. Claiming he could [[channeling (mediumistic)|channel]] the spirits of the departed and summon ethereal "entities", he encouraged church members to engage in sexual relations with the "spirits". He may have hired several women to play the parts of female spirits for this purpose.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074920,00.html Sex, Visitors from the Grave, Psychic Healing: Kubler-Ross Is a Public Storm Center Again] by Karen G. Jackovich. In ''People'', October 29, 1979, page found 2011-03-05.</ref> Kubler-Ross' friend Deanna Edwards attended a service to ascertain whether allegations against Barham were true. He was found to be naked and wearing only a turban when Edwards unexpectedly pulled masking tape off the light switch and flipped on the light.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Playboy Interview with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross'' Playboy Magazine, May, 1981</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-1,00.html TIME.com], [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946362-2,00.html ''The Conversion of Kubler-Ross'', TIME, November 12, 1979]</ref><ref>''Elisabeth Kubler-Ross in the Afterworld of Entities'' by Kate Coleman, New West, 30 July 1979</ref>

Kubler-Ross may have thought that Christianity  taught transmigration of the soul ([[reincarnation]]).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

She conducted many workshops on [[AIDS]] in different parts of the world. In 1990 she moved the healing Center to her own farm in Head Waters, Virginia to reduce her extensive travelling.

K<U+00FC>bler-Ross suffered a series of strokes in 1995 which left her partially paralyzed on her left side, and the healing Center closed around that time. In a 2002 interview with ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', she stated that she was ready for death. She died in 2004 at her home in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], and was later buried at the Paradise Memorial Gardens cemetery.

==Personal life==
In 1958 she married a fellow medical student from America, Emanuel ("Manny") Ross and moved to the United States. Becoming pregnant disqualified K<U+00FC>bler-Ross from a residency in pediatrics, so she took one in psychiatry. She had two miscarriages, finally having a son, [[Ken Ross (photographer)|Kenneth]], and a daughter, Barbara, in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://www.deathreference.com/Ke-Ma/K-bler-Ross-Elisabeth.html K<U+00FC>bler-Ross, Elisabeth<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Her husband requested a divorce in 1979.

One of her greatest wishes was her plan to build a [[hospice]] for infants and children infected with HIV to give them a last home where they could live until their passing, inspired by the aid-project of British doctor [[Cicely Saunders]]. In 1985 she attempted to do this in Virginia. But local residents feared the possibility of infection and blocked the necessary re-zoning. In 1994, she lost her house and possessions to an arson fire that is suspected to have been set by opponents of her AIDS work.<ref>[http://www.kinofenster.de/filmeundthemen/neuimkino/archiv_neuimkino/elisabeth_kueblerross_dem_tod_ins_gesicht_sehen_film/ Kinofenster.de] {{de icon}}</ref>
