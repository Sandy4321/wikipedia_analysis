'''Congestion pricing''' or '''congestion charges''' is a system of surcharging users of a [[transport network]] in periods of peak [[Demand (economics)|demand]] to reduce [[traffic congestion]]. Examples include some [[toll road|toll]]-like [[road pricing]] fees, and higher peak charges for [[public utility|utilities]], [[public transport]] and slots in [[canal]]s and [[airports]]. This [[variable pricing]] strategy regulates demand, making it possible to manage congestion without increasing [[Supply (economics)|supply]]. [[Market economics]] theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the [[externalities|negative externalities]] they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the [[Environmental quality|environment]].

The application on urban roads is limited to a small number of cities, including [[London congestion charge|London]], [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]], [[Electronic Road Pricing (Singapore)|Singapore]], and [[Ecopass|Milan]], as well as a few smaller towns. Four general types of systems are in use; a cordon area around a city center, with charges for passing the cordon line; area wide congestion pricing, which charges for being inside an area; a city center toll ring, with toll collection surrounding the city; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing, where access to a lane or a facility is priced.

Implementation of congestion pricing has reduced congestion in urban areas, but has also sparked criticism and public discontent. Critics maintain that congestion pricing is not equitable, places an economic burden on neighboring communities, has a negative effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general, and is just another tax. 

A survey of economic literature on the subject, however, finds that most economists agree that some form of road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable, although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take. They primarily argue that recent advances in technology have significantly reduced the previously high transaction costs of toll collection. Fuel taxes are not effective in reducing highway congestion, and tolls are the direct method.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Econ Journal Watch]]|volume=3|issue=2|pages=292<U+2013>379|author=Lindsey, Robin|title=Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Road Pricing?

== Description ==
[[File:TE-Pricing-EquilibriumCongestion.png|thumb|right|Economic rationale for moving from untolled equilibrium to congestion pricing equilibrium.]]
Congestion pricing is a concept from [[market economy|market economics]] regarding the use of [[Free price system|pricing]] mechanisms to charge the users of [[public good]]s for the [[externalities|negative externalities]] generated by the peak [[Demand (economics)|demand]] in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a [[economic shortage|shortage]], and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the [[equilibrium price]] rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing [[price]]s during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage [[Pigovian tax|tax]] or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply in the case of a tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.

According to the economic theory behind congestion pricing, the objective of this policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = Transport Economics 2nd Edition| publisher = [[Edward Elgar Publishing]] Ltd, England| isbn = 978-1-85278-523-9| pages = 153 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Small, Kenneth A.; Verhoef, Erik T. | title = The Economics of Urban Transportation | year = 2007 | publisher = Routledge, New York| isbn = 978-0-415-28515-5| pages = 120}}</ref> or shifting it to the consumption of a [[substitute good|substitute public good]]; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.

This pricing mechanism has been used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by [[telephone]] and [[Electric utility|electric utilities]], [[rapid transit|metros]], [[railway]]s and [[autobus]] services,<ref>{{Cite book | last = The World Bank | year = 1996 | title = Sustainable Transport: Priorities for Policy Reform| publisher = The World Bank, Washington, D.C.| isbn = 0-8213-3598-7| pages = 48<U+2013>49}}</ref> and has been proposed for charging [[internet access]].<ref>{{Cite web| last = Henderson, Tristan,  Jon Crowcroft, and Saleem Bhatti|url=http://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~tristan/pubs/ieeeic01.pdf|format=PDF| year = 2001 | title=Congestion Pricing - Paying Your Way in Communication Networks|publisher= IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING, September<U+2022>October 2001|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for [[port]]s, [[waterway]]s, [[airport]]s and [[road pricing]], though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = op. cit.| pages = 154<U+2013>156}}</ref><ref name="Ref-1">{{Cite journal| last = Small, Kenneth A.; Verhoef, Erik T. | title = op. cit| year = 2007| pages = 125<U+2013>127}}</ref>

The transport economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as "one policy response to the problem of congestion", was summarized in a testimony to the [[United States Congress]] Joint Economic Committee in 2003: "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it - and use it more wastefully - than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".<ref>{{Cite web|author= Holtz-Eakin, Douglas | date=2003-05-06|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdoc.cfm?index=4197|title= Congestion Pricing for Highways (Testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, U.S. Congress) |accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher = Congressional Budget Office }}</ref>

In economic terms, the optimal price of a public good must allow for resource allocation which maximises welfare, and because [[Welfare economics|social welfare]] is maximised when price is equated to the marginal cost, congestion charges should be set as the difference between the average cost and the marginal cost. The revenues generated by the congestion pricing mechanism usually go to the government, or can be redistributed to the users of the public good. Economists have different views on how to estimate the optimal price in practice, and to whom and how the revenues generated from congestion pricing should be redistribute.

:''For the broader concept on roads charges see [[road pricing]].''

Practical implementations of road congestion pricing are found almost exclusively in urban areas, because [[traffic congestion]] is common in and around city centers. [[A1 autoroute (France)|Autoroute A1]] in Northern [[France]] is one of the few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas. This is an expressway connecting [[Paris]] to [[Lille]], and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Small | first = Kenneth A. | last2 = Jos<U+00E9> A.

=== Concerns and criticisms ===
Both in the academic literature and in practice, the implementation of congestion pricing for urban road travel has raised several concerns, and has been subject of debate and controversy.

==== Measurement of effects ====
In a road network congestion can be considered a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through [[traffic jam]]s. Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density, road capacity, and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights, junctions, and street works. This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference.  However, this technical definition of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind.<ref>[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/tpm/congestionresearch/perceptions/perceptionsofcongestionrepor4026?page=1#a1002   Perceptions of congestion: report on qualitative research findings] Department for Transport 11 November 2001</ref> 

Thus some congestion charging schemes have been claimed a "success" because they have achieved a significant reduction in traffic volumes, even though there was little effect on actual journey times. These reduced traffic volumes may yield a reduction in the environmental impact of those vehicles, including emissions, noise, parking, and public transport benefits.

To measure the true effects of any traffic management scheme it is normally necessary to establish a baseline, or "do nothing" case, which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes. Notably this was not done for the [[London Congestion Charge|London Congestion Charging Scheme]], which has led to claims that it is not possible to determine the extent of the actual influence of the scheme.<ref>[http://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/Transport/Publications/anindependentassessmentofthecentrallondoncongestionchargingscheme.htm  An independent assessment of the central London congestion charging scheme] London Councils  13 December 2004 "The CCS is expected to compound these effects but it will be impossible to determine the extent to which it will have done so in the absence of a 'do minimum' comparison"</ref> Regardless of the scheme's impact, in a retrospective analysis [[Transport for London]] estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity. In 2006, the last year before the zone was expanded, TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year, while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/Ex-post-evaluation-of-quantified-impacts-of-original-scheme-07-June.pdf Ex post facto monetised evaluation of the quantified impacts of the original Central London congestion charge introduced in 2003] Reg Evans for TfL Congestion Charging Modelling and Evaluation Team, 29 June 2007</ref> Others have noted that changes in fuel pricing and [[fuel tax|taxation]] may also have an effect on measurements of any congestion pricing scheme.

==== Academic debate and concerns ====
Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by Cervero:<ref>{{Cite book | last = Cervero | first = Robert | year = 1998 | title = The Transit Metropolis | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 1-55963-591-6  "Setting the prices right"| pages = 67<U+2013>68}}</ref> 
<blockquote>"''True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents. Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many''."</blockquote>

Both Button <ref>{{Cite journal| last = Button| first = Kenneth J.| title = op. cit.| year = 1993| pages = 154<U+2013>156}}</ref> and Small et al.,<ref name="Ref-1"/> have identified the following issues:

* The real-world demand functions for urban road travel are more complex than the theoretical functions used in transport economics analysis. Congestion pricing was developed as a first-best solution, based on the assumption that the optimal price of road space equals the marginal cost price if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced. In the real world this is not true, thus, actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second-best solution. Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing, the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers (such as extra delay) and on society as a whole (such as air pollution).  The practical challenge of setting optimal link-based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link-specific speed-flow curves can be known precisely. Therefore, transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience.
* Inequality issue: A main concern is the possibility of undesirable distribution repercussions because of the diversity of road users. The use of the tolled road depends on the user's level of income.  Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users ''who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worst off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. [[Road space rationing]], is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing. However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site) are relatively more impacted.<ref>{{cite web| author= Victoria Transport Policy Institute| url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm33.htm |title=Vehicle Restrictions. Limiting Automobile Travel At Certain Times and Places |publisher= TDM Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-09}} See Equity Impacts section</ref>
* There are difficulties in deciding how to allocate the revenues raised. This is a controversial issue among scholars. The revenues can be used to improve public transport (as is the case in London), or to invest in new road infrastructure (as in Oslo).  Some academics make the case that revenues should be disposed as a direct transfer payments to former road users. Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax, however this is precisely one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers.

A more acceptable alternative to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a [[rationing]] of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Verhoef E, Nijkamp P, Rietveld P | url = http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=b240527 | year = 1997 | title = Tradeable permits: their potential in the regulation of road transport externalities | publisher = Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 24(4) 527 <U+2013> 548 |accessdate=2008-04-11 }}</ref> This system would be similar to the existing [[emissions trading]] of [[carbon credit]]. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Jos<U+00E9> M.

==== Public controversy ====

Experience from the few cities where congestion pricing has been implemented shows that social and political acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.

Congestion pricing remains highly controversial with the public both before and after implementation. This has in part been resolved through [[referendum]]s, such as after the seven-month trial period in [[Stockholm congestion tax|Stockholm]];<ref name="stockholm-trials">{{cite web|title=Stockholmsf<U+00F6>rs<U+00F6>ket|publisher=Stockholmsf<U+00F6>rs<U+00F6>ket|url=http://www.stockholmsforsoket.se/|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it often is the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.<ref>{{cite web|title=Resultat fr<U+00E5>n folkomr<U+00F6>stningen - hela staden|publisher=Stockholms stad|url=http://www.stockholm.se/OmStockholm/Forvaltningar-och-bolag/Andra-verksamheter-/Valnamnden/Folkomrostning-om-miljoavgiftertrangselskatt-/Resultat-fran-folkomrostningen---per-stadsdelsomrade/|accessdate=2007-07-18|language=Swedish}} {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tr<U+00E4>ngselskatt <U+2013> Resultat av folkomr<U+00F6>stningar|publisher=Kommunf<U+00F6>rbundet Stockholms l<U+00E4>n|url=http://val.cscs.se/|accessdate=2008-07-15|language=Swedish}}</ref>

Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity and land use,<ref>{{Cite web|author = Elena Safirova et al.|month = September | year = 2006|url=http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-06-37.pdf|format=PDF|title= Congestion Pricing: Long-Term Economic and Land-Use Effects|publisher = Resources for the Future. RFF DP 06-37|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> as the benefits are usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only. However, congestion pricing schemes have been used with the main objective of improving urban quality and to preserve historical heritage in the small cities.<ref name="Znojmo"/><ref>{{Cite web|author = European Local Transport Information Service (ELTIS)|date=Posted 2007|url=http://www.eltis.org/study_sheet.phtml?study_id=1610&mainID=458|title=Controlled Vehicle Access, Valleta, Malta|accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref> 

The effects of a charge on business have been disputed; reports have shops and businesses being heavily impacted by the cost of the charge, both in terms of lost sales and increased delivery costs in [[London congestion charge|London]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/04/22/cncong22.xml |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd |work=[[Daily Telegraph]] |title=Congestion charge cost <U+00A3>300m, say Oxford St traders |first=Caroline |last=Muspratt |date=2004-04-21 |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> while others show that businesses were then supporting the charge six months after implementation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2003/aug/18/londonpolitics.greaterlondonauthority |title=Business backs congestion charge |date=2003-08-13 |first=Andrew |last=Clark |accessdate=2008-07-15 |publisher=Guardian News and Media |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Reports show business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both [[productivity]] and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] and that the charge had a "broadly neutral impact" on the London wide economy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/FourthAnnualReportFinal.pdf |title=Impacts monitoring - Fourth Annual Report |format=PDF |publisher=[[Transport for London]] |accessdate=2008-02-11 |month=June | year=2006}}</ref> while others claim an average drop in business of 25% following the 2007 extension.<ref name="bbc20070521">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6676671.stm |title=Traders rally against charge zone |date=2007-05-21 |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> 

Other criticism has been raised concerning the environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone, with critics claiming that congestion pricing would create "parking lots" and add more traffic and pollution to those neighborhoods,<ref>{{cite news | author=Schuster, Karla and James T.

== Waterways ==
=== Panama Canal Transit Booking System and Transit Slot Auction ===

The [[Panama Canal]] has a limited capacity determined by operational times and cycles of the existing [[Lock (water transport)|locks]] and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to [[Panamax]]-sized) vessels transiting the [[canal]] which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, and the need for permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this [[waterway]]. On the other hand, demand is growing due to the rapid growth of [[international trade]]. Also many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the [[Panama Canal Authority]] (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012.<ref>[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/plan/documentos/propuesta/acp-expansion-proposal.pdf Autoridad del Canal de Panam<U+00E1> (ACP). ''Proposal for the Expansion of the Panama Canal. Third Set of Locks Project.'' April 24, 2006. pp. 34-38]</ref> The long-term solution for the congestion problems is the [[Panama Canal expansion project|expansion of the canal]] through a third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and will finish by 2014. The third set of locks will allow transit of larger, [[Post-Panamax]] ships, which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling.
 
[[Image:Exclusa Miraflores Canal de Panama Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Panamax]] ship in transit through the  Miraflores locks, [[Panama Canal]]]]
Considering the high operational costs of the vessels ([[containership]]s have daily operational costs of approximately US$40,000), the long queues that occur during the high season (sometimes up to a seven-day delay), and the high value of some of the cargo transported through the canal, the ACP implemented a congestion pricing scheme to allow a better management of the scarce capacity available and to increase the level of service offered to the shipping companies. The scheme gives users two choices: (1) transit by order of arrival on a first-come first-served bases, as the canal historically has operated; or (2) booked service for a fee<U+2014>a congestion charge.

The booked service allows two options of fees. The Transit Booking System, available online, allowing customers who do not want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice is high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biblioteca.prensa.com/contenido/2006/05/09/9-44a-nota2.html |title=Hasta 150 mil d<U+00F3>lares por reservar en el Canal |author=La Prensa |date=2006-05-09 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The main customers of the Transit Booking System are [[cruise ship]]s, [[containership]]s, [[vehicle carrier]]s, and non-containerized cargo vessels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pancanal.com/eng/plan/documentos/propuesta/acp-expansion-proposal.pdf |author=Panama Canal Authority |title=ACP Expansion Proposal |pages=36|format=PDF}}</ref>

The highest toll for high priority passage paid through the Transit Slot Auction was US$220,300 charged on a [[tanker (ship)|tanker]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ediciones.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2007/04/24/hoy/negocios/960466.html |title=R<U+00E9>cord en pago de peajes y reserva |author=Wilfredo Jord<U+00E1>n Serrano |publisher=La Prensa |date=2007-04-24 |language=Spanish|accessdate=2008-08-17}}</ref> bypassing a 90-ship queue awaiting for the end of maintenance works on the Gatun locks, thus avoiding a 7-day delay. The normal fee would have been just US$13,430.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mensual.prensa.com/mensual/contenido/2006/08/25/hoy/negocios/714407.html |title=Cupo de subasta del Canal alcanza r<U+00E9>cord |author=La Prensa.

== Airports ==

[[Image:JFK Plane Queue.jpg|thumb|right|New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], one the world's busiest]]
Many [[airport]]s are facing extreme congestion, [[runway]] capacity being the scarcest resource. Congestion pricing schemes have been proposed to mitigate this problem, including slot auctions, such as with the Panama Canal, but implementation has been piecemeal.<ref>[http://www.tinbergen.nl/discussionpapers/03083.pdf The Economics of Airport Congestion Pricing 2005]</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Doganis | first = R. | year = 1992 | title = The Airport Business| publisher = Routledge, London, UK | isbn = 978-0-415-08117-7| pages = 40}}</ref><ref>[http://www.icfi.com/Markets/Transportation/doc_files/airport-congestion.pdf Solving airside airport congestion: Why peak runway pricing is not working]</ref> The first scheme was started in 1968 when higher landing fees for peak-hour use by aircraft with 25 seats or less at [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Kennedy]], and [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia]] airports in New York City. As a result of the higher charges, [[general aviation]] activity during peak periods decreased by 30%. These fees were applied until deregulation of the industry, but higher fees for general aviation were kept to discourage this type of operations at New York's busiest airports. In 1988 a higher landing fee for smaller aircraft at [[Logan International Airport|Boston's Logan Airport]] was adopted; with much of the general aviation abandoned Logan for secondary airports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d03735t.pdf |title=Reducing Congestion: Congestion Pricing Has Promise for Improving Use of Transportation Infrastructure |pages=12 |author=United States General Accounting Office|format=PDF}}</ref> In both US cases the pricing scheme was challenged in court. In the case of Boston, the judge ruled in favor of general aviation users due to lack of alternative airports. In the case of New York, the judge dismissed the case because "the fee was a justified means of relieving congestion".<ref name=schank>{{cite web |url=http://www.icfi.com/Markets/Transportation/doc_files/airport-congestion.pdf |title=Solving airside airport congestion:Why peak runway pricing is not working |pages=420 |author=Schank, Joshua|format=PDF}}</ref>

Congestion pricing has also been implemented for [[airlines|scheduled airline services]]. The [[British Airports Authority]] (BAA) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing for all types of [[commercial aviation]]. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. [[London Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]] had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.<ref name=schank />

In 1991, the [[Athens International Airport|Athens Airport]] charged a 25% higher landing fee for those aircraft arriving between 11:00 and 17:00 during the high tourism season during summer. [[Hong Kong]] charges an additional flat fee to the basic weight charge.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Doganis | first = R. | year = 1992 | title = The Airport Business| publisher = Routledge, London, UK | isbn = 978-0-415-08117-7| pages = 66}}</ref> In 1991<U+2013>92 peak pricing at London's main airports [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] was implemented; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off-peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft.<ref>R. Doganis ''op. cit.'' pp. 95-96</ref> For example, in the case of a [[Boeing 757]], the peak landing fee was about 2.5 times higher than the off-peak fee in all three airports. For a [[Boeing 747]] the differential was even higher, as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = Transport Economics 2nd Edition| publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, England| isbn = 978-1-85278-523-9 see Table 6.3| pages = 142<U+2013>143}}</ref> Though related to runway congestion, the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment.
