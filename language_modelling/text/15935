"'''Ghetto Story'''" is a dancehall/ragga single performed by dancehall artist [[Cham (singer)|Baby Cham]] signed to [[Atlantic Records]]. It was the first single to be released off his album called [[Ghetto Story]]. The song is most known for its [[reggae fusion]] remix called '''"Ghetto Story Chapter 2"''' featuring [[Alicia Keys]]. The single has peaked at number 77 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] trajectory, number 15 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Hot Hip Hop/R&B Singles, and number 13 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Rap Tracks. It received heavy airplay on [[MTV2]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], and some airplay on [[Canada]]'s [[MuchMusic]]. The song is about growing up in the [[ghetto]] and how it was for Cham in his younger years. The video entered [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s [[106 & Park]] at number 9 peaked at number 5, making it one of the very few [[reggae]] videos to reach the top 5 on that countdown. Another remix features singer [[Akon]]. Rapper [[Lil Wayne]] has [[freestyle rap|freestyled]] over the [[instrumental]].

==Song information==
{{Cquote|Here's my, ghetto story. Been in hell through the fire, now, gonna take it higher. Here's my survival story. So many reasons to sing now, plus now we got the keys to the kingdom.}}

These are the lyrics to the intro sung by [[Alicia Keys]]. The overall feel of the song is rage and celebration that the two have made it out of the [[ghetto]] and out of their early struggles{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The lyrics are very informative as Cham and Alicia Keys explain how it felt to live in the ghetto. Cham says ''A lot of people like the song for its lyrics and overall feel of the song.''
These are the first two lines in Cham's opening verse:

{{Cquote|I remember those days when Hell was my home. And me and Mama bed was a big piece of foam.}}

In the official remix, which also includes singer [[Akon]], he explains his way of living in the ghetto, and how he made it, the lines in his opening verse:

{{Cquote|See I was poor like many men, and didn't have nothin'. Came to America, trying to make somethin' out of somethin'. See we [[African people|Africans]] we like hunting. Found my way up to the top like it wasn't nothin.}}

The song uses the "85" riddim.

==Music video==
"Ghetto Story"'s video is the Chapter 2 featuring [[Alicia Keys]]. It was shot in [[Jamaica]] by [[Sanaa Hamri]]. It shows the storyline of the lyrics and what it was like for Cham and Alicia Keys to live in a ghetto area. The unofficial video was put on MTV in late March. The video premiered on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'' on August 8, 2006 and entered the countdown three weeks later to debut at number nine and stay there for four days in a row.
