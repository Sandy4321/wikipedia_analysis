'''Paul Kletzki''' (21 March 1900{{ndash}}5 March 1973) was a Polish conductor and composer.

Born '''Pawe<U+0142> Klecki''' in [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]], [[Poland]], he later adopted the German spelling Paul Kletzki. He joined its Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of fifteen. After serving in the [[World War I|First World War]], he studied philosophy at the [[University of Warsaw]] before moving to [[Berlin]] in 1921 to continue his studies. During the 1920s his compositions were championed by [[Arturo Toscanini]]; and [[Wilhelm Furtw<U+00E4>ngler]], who permitted Kletzki to conduct the [[Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]] in 1925. Because he was Jewish, he left Nazi Germany in 1933 and moved to Italy, however due to the anti-semitism of the Italian Fascist regime he moved to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1936 but had to flee during [[Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] and went to live in Switzerland.

Kletzki's most notable work is his Third Symphony, completed in October 1939, with the subtitle 'In memoriam'. It is an elegiac work interpreted as a moving monument to the victims of Nazism.  Other works include two string quartets, a Sinfonietta for strings, a Fantasy for piano, and a sonata for violin and piano.  From 1942 onwards Kletzki wrote no more compositions; he argued that Nazism had destroyed his spirit and his will to compose. During the [[Holocaust]] a number of Kletzki's family were murdered by the Nazis including his parents and his sister.

In the post-war years Kletzki was a renowned conductor, especially of [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]. In 1954 he was appointed chief conductor of the [[Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]].  Between 1958 and 1961 he was principal conductor of the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]]. From 1966 until 1970 he was the General Music Director of the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]].
