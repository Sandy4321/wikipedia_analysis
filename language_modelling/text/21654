'''''30 Seconds to Mars''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American [[rock music|rock]] band [[30 Seconds to Mars]], released on August 21, 2002. The album was produced by [[Bob Ezrin]], Brian Virtue and 30 Seconds to Mars, and was recorded in [[Los Angeles]] during 2001 and early 2002. ''30 Seconds to Mars'' is a [[concept album]] that focuses on human struggle and self-determination, with personal lyrics that sometimes use otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation.

Upon its release in August 2002, ''30 Seconds to Mars'' reached number 107 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the [[Top Heatseekers#Heatseekers Albums chart|Top Heatseekers]]. The album received generally positive reviews, many of which compared 30 Seconds to Mars to [[Pink Floyd]], [[Tool (band)|Tool]], and [[Brian Eno]]. The album produced two singles, "[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]" and "Edge of the Earth"; the former peaked at number 31 on the [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. 30 Seconds to Mars promoted the album by opening concerts for bands such as [[Puddle of Mudd]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Sevendust]], and [[Chevelle]].

Following the release of this album, 30 Seconds to Mars music differs notably from it, both musically and lyrically. Whereas this concept album's lyrics focus on human struggle and astronomical themes, ''[[A Beautiful Lie]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lyrics are more personal and the music introduces intense screaming vocals and synth effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/30secondstomars0905.phtml|title=30 Seconds To Mars: A Savory Reality|accessdate=2010-09-07|last=Campagna|first=Cathy|date=2005-09-01|publisher=Shoutweb.com}}</ref>

==Writing and development==
On May 23, 2001, 30 Seconds to Mars announced that they are working with [[Bob Ezrin]] on the debut album, tentatively titled ''Welcome to the Universe'', and they wrote over fifty songs before paring it down to only ten.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031213124704/30secondstomars.com/html/main.asp?EventDate=all|archivedate=2003-12-12|title=In the Studio|publisher=30 Seconds to Mars|date=2001-05-23|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> 30 Seconds to Mars retreated to the isolation of [[Wyoming]] to record the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandchat.org/articles/2004/30stm.html|year=2004|title=Interview with Shannon|publisher=Bandchat.org|location=[[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]]|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> The band and Ezrin chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres.

<blockquote>
"Bob Ezrin is one of the world's greatest producers. He was at the top of our list from the very beginning, literally. We felt he had the ability to help us bring the size and scope of what we wanted to this album, and he did. Brian Virtue is an amazing new producer and was with us every step of the way and was a key element in helping us define our sound."<ref name=shoutweb>{{cite web|url=http://www.shoutweb.com/interviews/30secondstomars0502.phtml|title=30 Seconds To Mars: Welcome To Their Universe|accessdate=2010-08-11|last=Redmon|first=Jess| date=2002-05-10|publisher=Shoutweb.com}}</ref>
</blockquote>
Studio musicians [[Renn Hawkey]], [[Elijah Blue Allman]], [[Maynard James Keenan]], [[Danny Lohner]], and producer Bob Ezrin also contributed performances on select tracks.<ref name=booklet/> Some of the songs had different names before the album was finalized and demo versions were also slightly different. "Fallen" was previously called "Jupiter," "Oblivion" was called "The Reckoning" and "Year Zero" was called "Hero." Demo versions of "Fallen," "Buddha for Mary" and "93 Million Miles" floating around.<ref name=shoutweb/> The band has also recorded a few other tracks as "Valhalla" and "Occam's Razor," that were released on an early 1999 demo, and "Phase 1: Fortification," that was released on a promotional single for "[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]" in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/info_lyrics.htm#Valhalla|title=30 Seconds to Mars <U+2013> Valhalla|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/info_lyrics.htm#Occams%20Razor|title=30 Seconds to Mars <U+2013> Occam's Razor|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/info_lyrics.htm#Phase%201%20Fortification|title=30 Seconds to Mars <U+2013> Phase 1: Fortification|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> "Revolution" was not included in the track listing because its lyrics could be misinterpreted; the band chose not to include the song in light of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref name=shoutweb/> "Anarchy in Tokyo" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.30secondstomars.ca/30stm/info_lyrics.htm#Anarchy%20in%20Tokyo|title=30 Seconds to Mars <U+2013> Anarchy In Tokyo|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref><ref name=yesasia/> The lyrics of the hidden track, "The Struggle," were taken from [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]''.<ref name=marsdust>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061022232229/http://www.marsdust.com/30stm.htm|archivedate=2003-12-28|title=Space, symbols, and synth-rock imbue the metaphoric musical world of 30 Seconds To Mars|work=''Mars Dust''|publisher=Mysterian Media|last=Lowachee|first=Karin|authorlink=Karin Lowachee|year=2003|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

==Musical style and themes==
While some influences come by way of ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (one of the band's favorite books) and similar, the space theme is meant as a metaphor for the human experience.<ref name=marsdust/> Jared Leto explained "everything on this album is about real human experience. That is the single most inspiring source for us, the human struggle. Lyrically, it's a very personal album that sometimes uses otherworldly elements or conceptual ideas to illustrate a truthful personal situation."<ref name=shoutweb/> The band drew influence from [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Cure]], [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Depeche Mode]], [[The Who]]; according to Shannon Leto "mostly big conceptional bands; bands that had depth; bands that were dynamic."<ref name=shoutweb/><ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030825234740/http://www.infamoussouls.com/interviews/is_interview_30secondstomars.htm|archivedate=2003-08-25|title=Welcome to the Universe|publisher=Infamous Souls|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> [[Karin Lowachee]], describing the meanings of the songs, said "Admittedly interested in things otherwordly and their relationship to (sub) cultures, lyricist Jared allows the listener to draw his or her own conclusions to the songs' meanings. This makes the music especially personal, as whatever images you conjure from the sound and words can be interpreted by your own inner language."<ref name=marsdust/>

Jared Leto explained, "[[Capricorn (A Brand New Name)]]," the album's opening track, is "about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think that is one of the exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much."<ref name=shoutweb/> "Fallen" is about escape. It is the oldest of all the songs on the album and, initially, it was not going to be included. There was a demo floating around that the band wasn't satisfied with but there were some that had strong feelings about this song within the 30 Seconds to Mars camp, so they decided to rework it.<ref name=shoutweb/> "Buddha for Mary" is not about a specific person, it's "definitely a metaphor," Jared said.<ref name=shoutweb/> About "End of the Beginning" Jared explained "I think we are all looking for something, and we always will be. I think it's our nature."<ref name=shoutweb/> Describing "Revolution" as an [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] song, Jared commented "We don't feel it is an anti-American song at all. That is a song that can be taken many different ways. If it is taken literally or politically it could be misinterpreted. We didn't want a song like that to overshadow what we are about. And considering that people have a tendency to take things very literal we felt that especially after 9/11 it didn't fit thematically with the rest of the record. It took on new dimensions."<ref name=shoutweb/>

The band's [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] logo, which 30 Seconds to Mars named "[[Mithra]]", bears the phrase "Provehito in Altum", the band's [[motto]]. Roughly translated from [[Latin language|Latin]], this means "Launch forth into the deep"; but a more stylized version would be "Rocket in(to) High(ness)". It can also be translated in "March on into higher grounds" or "Launch forth into higher grounds." The phoenix is a bird in [[Ancient Egyptian religion#Mythology|Egyptian mythology]] that lived in the desert for 500 years and then consumed itself by fire, later to rise renewed from its ashes. The [[arrow]] is a visual representation for "Provehito in Altum", the progressive leap. Is believed that the four glyphics have had two different meanings. The first explanation is that they stand for the band's name: the first symbol is two intertwined threes representing "30". The second is rotating in the opposite direction, almost as if it is counting down which symbolizes "seconds". The third is three vertical lines, that looking in between them, is got the [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] two which stands for "to". The fourth represents [[Mars]] with its two moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The second explanation is that they symbolize each of the four [[terrestrial planet]]s. The first symbol is two intertwined "M's" which stand for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The second looks like it is rotating in the opposite direction and [[Venus]] rotates in the opposite direction of all the terrestrial planets. The third is the roman numeral three which stands for [[Earth]], the third planet from the [[Sun]]. The last symbol is Mars with its two moons Phobos an Deimos. 30 Seconds to Mars has not officially commented on the glyphics. However the band has said that they represent different elements in the band.<ref name=shoutweb/><ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030508031841/http://www.manichaze.com/interviews/i30.htm|archivedate=2003-05-08|title=Interview with Shannon and Matt|publisher=Manic Haze|author=Laurie & Renee|year=2002|accessdate=2010-08-17}}</ref>

==Artwork==
After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], 30 Seconds to Mars was notified by the label that all artwork in production for the album was discontinued due of the graphic content of the image. Included were 10,000 posters that had an image of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter jet]] exploding in mid-air with the pilot ejecting safely from the plane. 30 Seconds to Mars fully agreed the images were inappropriate at that time and said that they never saw the artwork as a violent image.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031213124704/30secondstomars.com/html/main.asp?EventDate=all|archivedate=2003-12-12|title=Discontinued|publisher=30 Seconds to Mars|date=2001-09-13|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref> On July 29, 2002, 30 Seconds to Mars announced the new cover for the album.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031213124704/30secondstomars.com/html/main.asp?EventDate=all|archivedate=2003-12-12|title=Album Cover Design Finalized|publisher=30 Seconds to Mars|date=2002-07-29|accessdate=2010-08-11}}</ref>

Johan Wippsson of [[Melodic.net]] felt that "musically 30 Seconds to Mars has something new to add to the world with their space influenced modern rock," and praised the album saying that it is "one of the most unique album when it comes to an own style."<ref name=melodic/> Melodic.net also placed the album at number 22 on The Best Records of 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/topListYear.asp?year=2002&page=2|title=The Best of the Year|year=2002|publisher=[[Melodic.net]]|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> Amber Authier from ''[[Exclaim!]]'' praised the album, stating that "this epic record has conceptual similarities to bands like [[Queensr<U+00FF>che]] and [[Depeche Mode]]."<ref name=exclaim>{{cite web|title=30 Seconds to Mars|work=[[Exclaim!]]|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=850&fid1=12891&csid1=43|last=Authier|first=Amber|accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> [[Mitch Joel]] of ''[[Blistering]]'' commented that "this electric and electro mix of modern rock has fundamentals that must have made famed producer, Bob Ezrin fascinated and 30 Seconds to Mars is worth more than most of their peers on a song-by-song magnitude."<ref name="blistering"/> [[Jay Gordon]] praised the lyrics and wrote that 30 Seconds to Mars has been hailed as the next [[Pink Floyd]] and has been compared to [[David Bowie]]'s ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]''.<ref name="d1music"/> [[Karin Lowachee]] gave the album four out of five stars, and wrote that "listening to it from the beginning track, Capricorn, to the final offering of Year Zero, you get the distinct sense that for the duration you are in a decidedly different world, whether physical or inner."<ref name=marsdust/> [[Jaan Uhelszki]] of ''[[Alternative Press]]'' praised the album and wrote that they "are made of sterner stuff, with their prog-metal foundation enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody."<ref name=alternativepress/> Jon O'Brien from [[Allmusic]] praised the album saying "its 11 tracks are packed full of heavy, riff-laden guitars, prog metal beats, and Hollywood star Jared Leto's soaring vocals and sci-fi lyrics, making it one of the more convincing actor-turned-rock star efforts."<ref name="amg"/>

Some reviews were more critical, however; ''[[Kludge (magazine)|Kludge]]'' magazine's review summarized the album by saying "The entire project as a whole is top-heavy, with the strengths of the album crammed tightly into the first five songs," and continued "the song quality drops off completely at the halfway point."<ref name="kludge"/> Peter Relic of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', stated that the "album is undone by [Jared] Leto's baffling, pretentious poetry and the sanitized quality of the heavy guitars," while ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' described the album as having "a polished sheen, but Leto's delivery of his earnest, sci-fi-tinged lyrics gets monotonous over the course of the album."<ref name="metacritic"/>
