==Plot==
The film begins with Mr. A ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) sky-diving and landing on a train that is carrying the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Queen_regnant|Queen]]. He steals her crown by disguising himself as the Queen and escapes. Newly-promoted officer Ali ([[Uday Chopra]]) and Jai Dixit ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]) are introduced to Sonali Bose ([[Bipasha Basu]]), a special officer assigned to investigate Mr. A's case. After the initial investigation, Dixit's analyzes the underlying trend in Mr. A's heists. As per his analysis, a theft in a [[Mumbai]] city museum will follow.

Dixit's analysis proves wrong, however, when a disguised Mr. A steals a rare diamond from a different museum and escapes. In a televised challenge to the police, Mr. A announces that he will steal an ancient warrior sword. In response, Dixit, Bose and Khan enforce a strict vigil at the location housing the sword. At night, Mr. A meets his impersonator in the room that holds the sword. The police are alerted, but they  manage to steal the sword and escape. The impersonator turns out to be Sunehri ([[Aishwarya Rai]]), a woman who idolizes Mr. A, and after this they form an alliance of sorts.

In [[Rio de Janeiro]], Mr. A and Sunehri plan their next heist. As Dixit's analysis has named Rio the location of Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance. He unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, Mr. A discovers that Sunehri is a spy working for Jai after seeing them together at a theatre and then a parade. Aryan forces Sunehri to play a game of [[Russian roulette]]. Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her. However, after six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured because Aryan had not inserted a bullet into the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and that she loves him. Elsewhere in Rio de Janeiro, Ali develops strong affections towards Monali ([[Bipasha Basu]]), Sonali's twin sister. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early [[Lydia]]n coins while disguised as performing dwarfs.[[Image:Aishwarya D2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Aishwarya Rai as an old dwarf, in the movie ''Dhoom 2'']] Sunehri implies that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up on the top of a [[waterfall]], where Sunehri is caught by Ali. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall while Jai allows Sunehri to escape. After six months, it is revealed that Aryan is still alive and has opened a [[restaurant]] somewhere in the [[Fiji]] islands with Sunehri. Jai meets Aryan and Sunehri at the restaurant and states that despite their crimes, he does not wish to imprison the couple. He is aware of their feelings towards each other, but warns them against returning to their life of crime. Ali calls Jai as he departs the restaurant and Jai tells him that they have a new case in India.

===Reception===
The film received decent reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported 80% of five critics were positive and gave it a [[Rotten Tomatoes#Description|"fresh" certificate]].<ref name="80%"/> People of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented, "Loaded with enough attitude, Bollywood starpower and buff bodies to stop a speeding train, pic has been doing humongous biz since its Nov. 24 worldwide opening, and provides adequate proof that Yash Raj Films is good for more than just family-oriented comedy-dramas."<ref name="variety">{{cite news |title=Dhoom 2 <U+2013> 2006 |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932257.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |year=2006 |work= |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=20 July 2010 | first=Derek | last=Elley | date=6 December 2006}}</ref> Rachel Saltz of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewed, "The pleasure principle is palpable in the giddy, slick ''Dhoom 2'', a satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. The film is shot in sharp, primary colors, with sophisticated stunts, exotic location hopping and songs sung partly in [[English language|English]] (and available on [[iTunes]] no less). Beginning in the Namibian desert with a bit of post-colonial mischief <U+2014> the theft (literally) of the British crown <U+2014> and making stops in Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro, this cops and robbers tale embraces and devours every clich<U+00E9>, style and half-naked body it encounters. ''Dhoom 2'' may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs."<ref name="ny times">{{cite news |title=Dhoom 2 (2006) |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/376330/Dhoom-2/overview |year=2006 |work= |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 September 2009 | first=Rachel | last=Saltz}}</ref>

''Film Journal International'''s Ethan Alter said, "''Dhoom 2'' has all of the benefits of a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences, including a daring train [[robbery]] and an extended [[motorcycle]] [[chase]] outside of Rio. In other words, it's exactly like all of the mainstream programmers that Hollywood churns out every summer, although those movies often suffer from a conspicuous shortage of singing and dancing on DayGlo sets. (Just think of how some peppy dance numbers would have enlivened generic blockbusters like ''[[Poseidon]]'' and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.) ''Dhoom 2'' makes no lasting contributions to [[world cinema]], but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse."<ref name="film journal">{{cite web |title=Dhoom 2: Back In Action |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/esearch/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003465671 |year=2006 |work= |publisher=Film Journal International |accessdate=3 September 2009}}</ref>

''[[L.A. Weekly]]''{{'}}s David Chute stated the film, "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make you feel that nothing else matters."<ref name="80%"/> [[Taran Adarsh]] of ''[[Bollywood Hungama]]'' reported, "On the whole, ''Dhoom 2'' is a winner all the way. At the [[box office|box-office]], the film has already embarked on an earth-shattering initial and with multiple shows being conducted at multiplexes [16/18] with inflated [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] rates, the film will set new records in days to come.

That the twist in ''Dhoom 2'''s tail is not explained is yet another shortcoming.
