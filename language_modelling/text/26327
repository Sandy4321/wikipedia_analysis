'''Shottesbrooke''' is a [[hamlet]] and [[civil parish]] administered by the [[unitary authority]] of the [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]]. It is sometimes, incorrectly, spelt '''Shottesbrook'''.

==Geography==
Shottesbrooke is a very long narrow parish sandwiched between [[Waltham St Lawrence]] on the west and [[White Waltham]] on the east. They were originally one place, ''Waltham'', which was divided in the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon era]]. Today, as always, it is mostly farmland with some large areas of woodland in between, particularly the ''Great Wood''. The hamlet of Cold Harbour is in the very north of the parish, with Shottesbrooke itself in the central area, between Shottesbrooke Park and Smewins' Farm, where the B3024 runs through the region. The [[M4 motorway]] crosses the south-east corner of the parish.

==History==
The [[Roman road|Roman]] ''Camlet Way'' between [[St Albans]] and [[Silchester]] would have crossed the parish at some point and the name 'Cold Harbour' indicates there was an inn or other stopping place nearby. In Saxon times, the manor was owned by the Royal goldsmiths and 'Alward the Goldsmith' was one of the few Saxons allowed to keep his manor here after the [[Norman Conquest]]. It is said that charcoal from the 'Great Wood' was used to melt the gold to make the Saxon Royal [[regalia]].

Despite its small population, Shottesbrooke is a very historic parish, largely because of the great and the good who lived at Shottesbrooke Park. It was the home of Sir [[William Trussell]], a prominent Royal diplomat in the mid-[[14th century]]. He built the superb [[Decorated Period]] [[parish church]] as an ecclesiastical college in [[1337]]. The church is famous for its fine [[monumental brass|memorial brasses]] and Trussell's beautifully carved double-recessed [[church monument|monument]]. The [[17th century]] [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Henry Powle]] later lived at the Park. He was followed by [[Francis Cherry (non-juror)|Francis Cherry]], the famous [[non-juror]] and patron of [[Thomas Hearne]]. His friend, [[Henry Dodwell]], the [[theologian]], lived at Smewins. Later, Governor [[Henry Vansittart]] was in residence and his brother, Professor [[Robert Vansittart (jurist)|Robert Vansittart]] also grew up there. Until his death in [[2007]], the Park was the home of their co-lateral descendant, Sir [[John Lindsay Eric Smith|John Smith]], the founder of the [[Landmark Trust]] which has its headquarters in the adjoining farmhouse.

==Trivia==
Shottesbrooke is also the name of an [http://www.shottesbrooke.com.au/ Australian winery], named after the church where the owner's grandfather was vicar.
