'''BrowserChoice.eu''' was a [[website]] created in March 2010 as the result of the decision in the [[European Union Microsoft competition case]]. The case involved legal proceedings by the EU against [[Microsoft]] and found that, by including [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) with their market-dominant Windows operating system, Microsoft had used their dominance of the operating system market to also create a dominant market position in the [[web browser]] market. The BrowserChoice.eu website was created by Microsoft to allow users that had not made, or were unaware of, a choice to try other browsers, and thus comply with the [[European Commission]]'s ruling.

In December 2014, Microsoft's obligation to display the Browser Choice screen to Windows users expired.<ref name="ars">{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/12/windows-browser-ballot-comes-to-an-end-as-ec-obligation-expires |title=Windows Browser Ballot comes to an end as EC obligation expires |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=18 December 2014 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Cond<U+00E9> Nast |accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> Consequently, the BrowserChoice.eu website has been discontinued, only showing a notice advising users to "[visit] the websites of web browser vendors directly".<ref name="website">{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref>

==Web browser choice screen==
The ''web browser choice screen'', also known as the ''web browser ballot box'', is a screen displayed in [[Internet Explorer]] that offers eleven browsers in a random order.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2010/02/19/the-browser-choice-screen-for-europe-what-to-expect-when-to-expect-it.aspx |title=The Browser Choice Screen for Europe: What to Expect, When to Expect It |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |last=Heiner |first=Dave |date=19 February 2010 |accessdate=24 June 2011 }}</ref>

The screen is presented only to Windows users whose default web browser is Internet Explorer. It currently affects only the [[European Economic Area]],<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2009/dec09/12-16Statement.mspx |title=Microsoft Statement on European Commission Decision |publisher=Microsoft |date=16 December 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref> [[Croatia]] and [[Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff606439.aspx |title=Browser Choice FAQ |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2013-01-22 }}</ref>

A patch was made available via [[Windows Update]] to provide the screen to users. It was displayed to anyone who had not chosen another browser as their default browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Microsoft-liefert-Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster-ab-17-Maerz-aus-935566.html |title=Microsoft liefert Web-Browser-Auswahlfenster ab 17.

==Browsers listed==
The browser choice screen lists 11 browsers in random order; the top tier of five are immediately visible and the remaining six can be seen by scrolling the list. The order of the browsers on the page was initially planned to be alphabetical, however after criticism a random system is now used with two groups.

The first group includes the five most used browsers <U+2012> [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Maxthon]] <U+2012> representing the four major rendering engines ([[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]], [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]], [[Blink (layout engine)|Blink]] and [[WebKit]]). The second group contains six less well-known browsers, also in random order: [[Avant Browser]], [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]], [[SRWare Iron]] and [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]].

===Revisions===
The initial March 2010 list had [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] in the first tier, with [[Avant Browser]], [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[K-Meleon]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]] and [[SlimBrowser]] in the second tier.

In August 2010 Microsoft removed GreenBrowser and Sleipnir from the choices, replacing them with [[Lunascape (web browser)|Lunascape]] and [[SRWare Iron]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822062000/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=22 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828094328/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=28 August 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref>

In November 2011 Microsoft reduced the number of second tier browsers from the previous seven to six. They removed Flock and SlimBrowser, but re-established Sleipnir.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103214224/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=3 November 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>

In February 2012 Microsoft increased the number of second tier browsers to seven: [[Comodo Dragon (web browser)|Comodo Dragon]] and [[Rockmelt]] were added, while Sleipnir was removed again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224114437/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=24 February 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>

In August 2012 Microsoft removed Apple Safari from the first tier and replaced it with Maxthon. SlimBrowser was added back to the second tier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919182030/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=19 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref>

In February 2013 Microsoft removed SlimBrowser from the second tier and replaced it with Sleipnir.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226201610/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |archivedate=26 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013 Microsoft removed Rockmelt from the second tier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=30 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530112827/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014}}</ref>

By May 2014 Microsoft had removed Comodo Dragon from the second tier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516183141/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=16 May 2014}}</ref>

In September 2014 Comodo was returned to the second tier, replacing Avant Browser.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |title=Information Regarding Web Browsers |accessdate=18 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903235102/http://www.browserchoice.eu/BrowserChoice/browserchoice_en.htm |archivedate=3 December 2014}}</ref>

In December 2014 the website was discontinued and no longer lists any browsers.<ref name="ars" /><ref name="website" />

==Results==
Competing browsers have seen their traffic increase,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/technology/08browser.html |title=Microsoft Gives Rival Browsers a Lift |last=Pfanner |first=Eric |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 March 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 }}</ref> suggesting that these smaller competing developers are gaining users. However, long-term trends show browsers such as Opera and Firefox losing market share in Europe, calling into question the usefulness of the browser choice screen.<ref name="ars" />

==Criticism==
The source code of the page itself has come under criticism. The order of the browsers on screen was at first insufficiently random, which led to uneven distribution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/22/microsoft-ballot-screen |title=How Random Is Microsoft's Random Browser Choice Screen In Europe? |publisher=TechCrunch |last=Wauters |first=Robin |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/03/coding-error-leads-to-uneven-eu-browser-ballot-distribution |title=Coding error leads to uneven EU browser ballot distribution |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Bright |first=Peter |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref> This was later fixed by Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/09/microsoft_browser_ballot_update |title=Microsoft rejiggers EU browser ballot after complaints |publisher=[[The Register]] |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=9 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref>

The choice of browsers has also been criticised.<ref name="bbcLimited">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8545237.stm |title=Microsoft browser ballot criticised for being 'limited' |publisher=BBC |last=Ward |first=Mark |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref> At the time of its inception, half of the suggested browsers use Internet Explorer's [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] rendering engine, thus users who choose web browsers other than Internet Explorer for the intention of avoiding it might still end up using IE's layout engine.<ref name="bbcLimited" /> This has resulted in criticism amongst the web development community even though Microsoft was adhering to the court agreement's methodology.<ref name="bbcLimited" />

Finally, the overall ability for users to access the site has been criticised. [[Opera Software]] complained that the ballot screen could not be reached in some cases because of the start configuration screens of IE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/03/windows_ie_browser_ballot_screen |title=Opera alerts EU to hidden Windows browser-ballot |last=Clarke |first=Gavin |date=3 April 2010 |publisher=[[The Register]] |accessdate=8 April 2010 }}</ref> In 2012 Microsoft had issues with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 no longer leading new users in the [[European Union]] to the page. The [[Windows7#Service Pack 1|Windows 7 SP1]] retail release was initially missing BrowserChoice.eu functionality, affecting 28 million computers. The error remained unpatched for 14 months, and as a result in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft <U+20AC>561 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21684329 |title=Microsoft fined by European Commission over web browser |publisher=BBC |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=6 March 2013}}</ref> [[Windows 8]] was also released without the browser choice screen functionality and patched several days after the release. [[Mozilla]]'s general counsel estimated that 6-9 million downloads of Firefox web browser alone were lost due to the mistake.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/firefox-lost-6-9-million-downloads-in-eu-browser-choice-glitch-7000006670/ |title=Firefox lost 6-9 million downloads in EU browser choice 'glitch' |last=Whittaker |first=Zach |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/10/3307564/windows-8-browser-choice-europe-windows-update |title=Windows 8 browser choice update now available in Europe |last=Warren |first=Tom |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=10 September 2012 |accessdate=6 February 2013 }}</ref>

==Petition==
Makers of the second-tier browsers [[Flock (browser)|Flock]], [[Avant (browser)|Avant]], [[GreenBrowser]], [[Maxthon]], [[Sleipnir (browser)|Sleipnir]], and [[Slim (browser)|Slim]] sent a petition to the EU to get [[Microsoft]] to add text or a graphic (rather than just the slider) indicating that there are more than five browsers.<ref>[http://flock.com/petition_to_the_european_commission.pdf Petition To The European Commission] {{Dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> Microsoft responded by stating: ''"We (Microsoft) do not plan on making any changes at this time."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20000129-264.html |title=Minor browsers seek more prominence in Europe |publisher=CNET |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=14 October 2012 }}</ref>
