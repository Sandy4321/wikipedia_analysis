'''Hamza al-Ghamdi''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062D><U+0645><U+0632><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+063A><U+0627><U+0645><U+062F><U+064A>}}, also [[transliteration|transliterated]] as '''Alghamdi''') (November 18, 1980 <ref>http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf</ref> - September 11, 2001) was named by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as one of the [[Organizers of the September 11, 2001 attacks|hijackers]] of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]].

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], al-Ghamdi left his family to fight in [[Chechnya]] and was probably sent to [[Al-Qaeda]] training camps in [[Afghanistan]]. He arrived in the United States in May 2001 on a tourist visa. On September 11, 2001, al-Ghamdi boarded [[United Airlines Flight 175]] and hijacked the plane along with four other terrorists so that the plane could be crashed into the south tower of the [[World Trade Center]].

== History ==
Al-Ghamdi was from the [[Al Bahah Province]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], an isolated and underdeveloped area, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]], [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]], and [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]]. This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met each other some time in 1999.

Some reports say that al-Ghamdi left his home to fight in [[Chechnya]] against the [[Russia]]ns in early 2000. (Other reports say he left in January 2001.) He called home several times until mid-2001, saying he was in Chechnya.

Known as ''Julaybeeb'' during the preparations,<ref name="willalOmari">Videotape of recorded will of Abdulaziz al-Omari and others</ref> Hamza traveled to the [[United Arab Emirates]] some time in late 2000, where he purchased [[traveler's cheques]] presumed to have been paid for by [[Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi]].  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including [[Majed Moqed]], [[Saeed Alghamdi]], [[Wail al-Shehri]], [[Ahmed al-Haznawi]] and [[Ahmed al-Nami]].

In January 2001, al-Ghamdi rented a post office box in [[Delray Beach, Florida]] with another hijacker, [[Mohand al-Shehri]].  According to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] director [[Robert Mueller]] and the [[9/11 Commission]] however, Hamza did not first enter the United States until a [[London]] flight on May 28 with Mohand and [[Abdulaziz Al-Omari]].

In March 2001, al-Ghamdi was filmed in a farewell video that was aired on [[al Jazeera]]. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. Al-Ghamdi does not speak in the film, but is seen studying maps and flight manuals.<ref>[http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline/2002/financialtimes091102.html "Cooperative Research.org."]</ref>

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a [[SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001.  Al-Ghamdi also applied for and received a Florida drivers license on June 27, 2001. In the next two months, he obtained two duplicate licenses simply by filling out change-of-address forms. Five other suspected hijackers also receive duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses in different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.<ref>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story "World Trade Center Suspect profiles."] ''Sun-Sentinel''.</ref>

== Attack ==
Hamza purchased his own eTicket for [[Flight 175]] on August 29, using his [[VISA (credit card)|Visa card]]. The FBI also claimed that he also purchased an eTicket for a "Flight 7950" from Los Angeles to San Francisco, although it does not give the projected date of flight.<ref name="Senate">[http://intelligence.senate.gov/0209hrg/020926/mueller.pdf "Statement for the record FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III Joint Intelligence Committee inquiry." (.pdf)] ''[[United States Senate|US Senate]]''. September 25, 2002. [http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2002_hr/092602mueller.html - mirror]</ref>

On August 30, Hamza bought [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] an identical eTicket for [[Flight 175]], and bought them each one-way tickets on an [[AirTran]] flight on September 7, from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Boston]]. However, Hamza instead went with [[Mohand al-Shehri]] to [[Newark, New Jersey]] on $139.75 tickets purchased from the Mile High Travel agency in [[Lauderdale-by-the-Sea]].

Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi stayed at the Charles Hotel in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  On September 8 they checked out of the hotel, and moved into the [[Days Hotel]] on Soldiers Field Road in [[Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts]] where they remained up until the attacks.<ref name="Senate" /><ref name="BostonGlobe010915">[http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/globe_stories/0915/Hijackers_may_have_taken_Saudi_identities+.shtml "Hijackers may have taken Saudi identities."] ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. September 15, 2001.</ref>

On the morning of September 11, 2001, Hamza left the hotel with [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]]. The two men shared a [[taxicab]] to get to [[Logan International Airport]], where they boarded flight 175, helped to hijack it, and assisted [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] to crash the [[Boeing 767]] into the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center]].

== Aftermath ==
On September 22, 2001, [[Arab News]] reported that Hamza al-Ghamdi's father told the [[Al-Watan]] newspaper that an "FBI-released" photograph bore absolutely no resemblance to his son.<ref name="ArabView010922">[http://www.arabview.com/articles.asp?article=98 "Hijacker list raises more questions."] ''[[Arab View]]''. September 22, 2001</ref> However, the picture al-Ghamdi's father refers to is assumed to have not been a picture released by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], as they did not make the hijacker's pictures available until September 27, 2001.<ref name="Fbi010927">[http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/092701hjpic.htm "The FBI releases 19 photographs of individuals believed to be the hijackers of the four airliners that crashed on September 11, 01."] ''[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]''. September 27, 2001.</ref>

He appeared in a [[video]] released on September 7, 2006, that showed the planning of the attacks.<ref name="Cnn060907">[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/07/alqaeda.911/index.html "Video is said to show bin Laden prepping for 9/11 attacks."] ''[[CNN]]''. September 7, 2006.</ref>
