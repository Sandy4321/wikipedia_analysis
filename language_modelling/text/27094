The documents record official military matters as well as personal messages to and from members of the garrison of Vindolanda, their families, and their slaves. Highlights of the tablets include an invitation to a birthday party held in about 100 AD, which is perhaps the oldest surviving document written in Latin by a woman. Held at the [[British Museum]], the texts of 752 tablets have been transcribed, translated and published as of 2010.<ref name=bowman2010>{{citation |journal=Britannia |year=2010 |volume=41 |page=187<U+2013>224 |publisher=[[Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies]] |doi=10.1017/S0068113X10000176 |title=The Vindolanda Writing-Tablets (Tabulae Vindolandenses IV, Part 1) |first=A.K. |last=Bowman |first2=J.D. |last2=Thomas |first3=R.S.O. |last3=Tomlin}}</ref> Tablets continue to be found at Vindolanda.

==Description==
The wood tablets found at Vindolanda were the first known surviving examples of the use of ink letters in the Roman period. The use of ink tablets was documented in contemporary records and [[Herodian]] in the third century AD wrote "a writing-tablet of the kind that were made from lime-wood, cut into thin sheets and folded face-to-face by being bent".<ref name=bowman1994a15>{{harvnb|Bowman|1994a|p=15-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/exhibition/docs-1.shtml |title=Vindolanda tablets online; Writing tablets - forms and technology |accessdate=2011-03-02 |publisher=Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents}}</ref>

The Vindolanda tablets are made from birch, alder and oak that grew locally, in contrast to stylus tablets, another type of writing tablet used in Roman Britain, which were imported and made from non-native wood. The tablets are 0.25<U+2013>3mm thick with a typical size being 20x8cm (the size of a modern postcard). They were scored down the middle and folded to form [[diptych]]s with ink writing on the inner faces, the ink being carbon, [[gum arabic]] and water. Nearly 500 tablets were excavated in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=bowman1994a15/>

First discovered in March 1973, the tablets were initially thought to be wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They were taken to the epigraphist [[Richard Wright (epigrapher)|Richard Wright]], but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable by the time he was able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at [[Newcastle University Medical School]] for multi-spectrum photography which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, [[Alan Bowman]] at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.<ref>{{harvnb|Birley|2005|pp=57-58}}</ref>

===Chronology===
Vindolanda fort was garrisoned before the construction of Hadrian's Wall and most of the tablets are slightly older than the Wall, which was begun in 122AD. The original director of excavations [[Robin Birley (archaeologist)|Robin Birley]] identified five periods of occupation and expansion:<ref>{{harvnb|Bowman|1994a|p=13}}</ref>
# c. 85-92 AD, first fort constructed.
# c. 92-7 AD, fort enlargement.
# c. 97-103 AD, further fort enlargements.
# c. 104-120 AD, hiatus and re-occupation.
# c. 120-130 AD

The tablets were produced in periods 2 and 3 (c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;92<U+2013>130), with the majority written before AD&nbsp;102.<ref name=Franklin2002>{{citation | last=Franklin | first=Simon | year=2002 | title=Writing, society and culture in early Rus, c. 950<U+2013>1300 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=9780521813815 | page=42<U+2013>45}}</ref> They were used for official notes about the Vindolanda camp business and personal affairs of the officers and households. The largest group is correspondence of Flavius Cerialis, prefect of the ninth [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavians]] and that of his wife, [[Sulpicia Lepidina]]. Some correspondence may relate to civilian traders and contractors, for example Octavian, the writer of Tablet 343, is an entrepreneur dealing in wheat, hides and sinews, but this does not prove him to be a civilian.

The tablets are written in [[Roman cursive]] script and throw light on the extent of literacy in Roman Britain. One of the tablets confirms that Roman soldiers wore underpants (''subligaria''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/TVII-346 |title=Vindolanda Tablets Online |location=Tab. Vindol.

There are only scant references to the indigenous [[Britons (historical)|Britons]]. Until the discovery of the tablets, historians could only speculate on whether the Romans had a nickname for the Britons. ''Brittunculi'' (diminutive of ''Britto''; hence 'little Britons') found on one of the Vindolanda tablets, is now known to be a derogatory, or patronizing, term used by the Roman garrisons that were based in Northern Britain to describe the locals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/TVII-164 |title=Vindolanda Tablets Online |location=Tab. Vindol. II 164 |quote=Especially noteworthy in the Vindolanda text is the occurrence, for the first time, of the patronising diminutive Brittunculi (line 5, contrast Brittones in line 1). This remains the only published text from Vindolanda which refers explicitly to the native Britons collectively or individually. |publisher=Oxford University |accessdate=2011-02-07}}</ref>

===Transcription===
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Old Roman Cursive script.]]
The tablets are written in forms of Roman cursive script, considered to be the forerunner of joined up writing, which varies in style by author.<ref>{{harvnb|Birley|2005|p=64}}</ref> With few exceptions they have been classified as Old Roman Cursive.<ref name=Bowman1984>{{citation | last1=Bowman | first1=Alan K. | year=1984 | title=Vindolanda: the Latin writing-tablets | last2=Thomas | first2=John David | publisher=A. Sutton | isbn=9780862991180}}</ref>

The writing from Vindolanda appears if it were written in a different alphabet from the Latin capitals used for inscriptions from other periods. The script is derived from the capital writing of the late first century BC and the first century AD. The text rarely shows the unusual or distorted letter-forms or the extravagant ligatures to be found in Greek papyri of the same period.<ref name=Bowman1984/> Additional challenges for transcription are the use of abbreviations such as "h" for ''homines'' (men) or "cos" for ''consularis'' (consular), and the arbitrary division of words at the end of lines for space reasons such as ''epistulas'' (letters) being split between the "e" and the rest of the word.<ref>{{harvnb|Birley|2005|p=65}}</ref>

The ink is often badly faded or survives as little more than a blur, so that in some instances transcription is not possible. In most cases the infra-red photographs provide a far more legible version of what was written than the original tablets. However the photographs contain marks which appear similar to writing, but which certainly are not letters, and they contain a great many lines, dots and other dark marks which may or may not be writing. Consequently the published transcriptions have often had to be subjective in deciding which marks to treat as writing.<ref name=Bowman1984/>

==Comparison to other sites==
Letters were sent to and from places on Hadrian's Wall and further afield - [[Catterick, North Yorkshire|Catterick]], [[Eboracum|York]], and London.<ref name=Franklin2002/> This raises the question of why more letters have been found at Vindolanda than other sites, but it is not possible to give a definitive answer.

Wooden tablets (mainly stylus tablets) have been found at twenty Roman settlements in Britain. The anaerobic conditions found at Vindolanda are not unique and identical deposits have been found in parts of London and significant numbers of ink tablets have been identified at [[Luguvalium|Carlisle]] (also on Hadrian's Wall).<ref>{{harvnb|Birley|2005|p=108}}</ref><ref>[http://www.csad.ox.ac.uk/RIB/RIBIV/jp5.htm "A Progress Report"], Website of ''A Corpus of Writing-Tablets from Roman Britain'', a research project of the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents, Oxford, initiated around 2000. Retrieved 2011-02-25</ref><ref>[[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in Carlisle has a small display of tablets.[http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/roman-carlisle-and-hadrians-wall]</ref> One possibility, given the fragile condition of the tablets found at Vindolanda, is that archaeologists excavating other Roman sites have overlooked evidence of writing in ink.

==Imaging==
The tablets were photographed using infra-red sensitive cameras in 1973 by Susan M. Blackshaw in the British Museum and more comprehensively in 1990 at Vindolanda by Alison Rutherford.<ref name=blackshaw/><ref>{{harvnb|Birley|2002|p=29}}</ref> The tablets were scanned again using improved techniques in 2000<U+2013>2001 with a Kodak [[Wratten number|Wratten 87C]] [[Infrared photography|infra-red filter]]. The photographs are taken in infra-red to enhance the faded ink against the wood of the tablets, or between ink and dirt, to make the writing more visible.<ref name=Bowman2005>{{citation |last=Bowman |first=Alan K |year=2005 |title=Images and artefacts of the ancient world |last2=Brady |first2=Michael |last3=Academy |first3=British |author4=Royal Society (Great Britain) |publisher=Oxford |series=British Academy occasional paper, 4. |isbn=9780197262962 |pages=7-14}}</ref>

The images, at a resolution suitable for web page display, and text of the tablets were published on-line.<ref group=n>See [http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk Vindolanda Tablets Online]. The digitization and on-line database project was a collaboration between the Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents and the Academic Computing Development Team at [[Oxford University]] with the support of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Board]]. The project directors were [[Alan Bowman]], Charles Crowther and John Pearce. See http://vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/about.shtml</ref> There are plans to publish recent transcriptions along with the material from ''Tab.Vindol.

==Exhibition and impact==
[[File:Vindolanda tablets 2.jpg|thumb|right|Tablets on display at the British Museum]]
The tablets are held at the British Museum, where a selection of them is on display in its Roman Britain gallery (Room 49).
The tablets featured in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the [[2003 in television|2003]] [[BBC Television]] [[documentary television series|documentary]] ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]]''. Viewers were invited to vote for their favourite, and the tablets came top of the poll.

The Vindolanda Museum, run by the Vindolanda Trust, has funding so that a selection of tablets on loan from the British Museum can be displayed at the site where they were found.<ref>{{cite web|author=Knowles, Bija|url=http://heritage-key.com/blogs/bija-knowles/tablets-return-vindolanda-spring-2011-thanks-%C2%A34-million-heritage-lottery-funding |title=Tablets to Return to Vindolanda in Spring 2011 Thanks to <U+00A3>4 Million Heritage Lottery Funding |publisher=Heritage Key |date=10 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Journal (Newcastle) |date=29 September 2009 |title=Cash Boost Paves Way For Vindolanda Letters To Return Home |first=Tony |last=Henderson |page=9 |quote=It is more than 20 years since any of the Vindolanda tablets have been on show at the fort near Bardon Mill. But that is set to change after an award of <U+00A3>4m today from the Heritage Lottery Fund. That means a <U+00A3>6.5m project to upgrade both Vindolanda and its twin Roman Army Museum seven miles away at Carvoran will now go ahead... It is hoped that from spring 2011 the first batch of letters will return from the British Museum on a three to five-year loan, which can then be refreshed. "To have the letters back on public display would be wonderful and we are very excited," said Patricia Birley, director of the Vindolanda Trust. "Negotiations with the British Museum have been excellent and they are fully supportive of our efforts to get tablets back to Vindolanda."}}</ref> The Vindolanda Museum will be displaying nine of the tablets in 2011. This loan of items to a regional museum is in line with British Museum's current policy of encouraging loans both internationally and nationally (as part of its Partnership UK scheme).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/museum_in_the_uk/partnership_uk.aspx |title=Partnership UK |publisher=British Museum |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>
