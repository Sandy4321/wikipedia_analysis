The '''Coalition for Unity and Inclusion''' (founded 2000) was a coalition of [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] activists who drew support from reform minded directors of the more traditional [[LGBT]] organizations, liberal politicians as well as the grass-roots [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] community.  They used such tactics as letter writing campaigns and petition drives  to achieve their goals.

In 2005, the Coalition merged with [[BiPAC]] to form [[Bialogue]]<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network - Our History page]</ref>.
