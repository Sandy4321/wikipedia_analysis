'''David Price''' (born 6 July 1983) is an English professional boxer from [[Liverpool]], [[England]], competing in the heavyweight division. He is the former British and [[List of Commonwealth Boxing Council Champions#Heavyweight|Commonwealth]] heavyweight champion, after Vacating the titles to re-build his career.

==Amateur career==
Early in his career, the 6ft 8" Price<ref>[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/can-eat-ko-boxing-champ-103131367.html Eurosport]</ref> boxed for Long Lane ABC before leaving through lack of available funding for Salisbury ABC and in 2003 became the youngest ever A.B.A champion in the Super-Heavyweight division, he was 19 years and 272 days old. He competed for [[England]] at a number of international tournaments, he beat [[Travis Kauffman]] twice at the 2003 USA vs. England Tournament. In August 2003 he won the Commonwealth Confederations tournament in [[Kuala Lumpur]], defeating Muzzafar Iqbal of [[Pakistan]] 21:9, and Justin Whitehead of [[Australia]] 22:6. He then defeated Gregory Corbin on points in the England-U.S.A dual in [[Liverpool]].

Price lost to [[Roberto Cammarelle]] in the quarter-finals of the [[European Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Bulgaria]] in 2004, a defeat that prevented him from going to the [[Athens]] [[2004 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. Later that year Price made it to the finals of the Tammer Tournament in [[Finland]], but he was stopped by [[Bermane Stiverne]]. He bounced back to win his second A.B.A Title in March 2005, defeating Damien Campbell of Repton ABC in the final. He also went on to win the 4 Nations Championships and two weeks later, a win which enabled him to compete in the inaugural 4 Nations vs Cuba match, in which he was his side's sole victor, defeating Lisovan Hernandez. He participated at the [[2005 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] but lost on points to [[Robert Helenius]] 25-22.

At the Strandya Cup in [[Bulgaria]], he was stopped by Ukrainian [[Vyacheslav Glazkov]], though he ended the year on a high note defeating highly touted teenage compatriot [[Tyson Fury]] 22:8. Then going on to win his 3rd A.B.A title, defeating Tom Dallas 27:4. At the 2007 Commonwealth Championships he stopped Australian [[Daniel Beahan]] in the final.

=== 2006 Commonwealth Games ===

Price captained the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] boxing team in [[Melbourne]] and achieved a gold medal there, beating Indian [[Varghese Johnson]] in the process, despite being knocked down three times.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/commonwealth_games/4835800.stm | work=BBC News | title=Stunning comeback seals Price win | date=23 March 2006}}</ref>

=== 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships ===
At the [[2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships]] in [[Chicago]] he defeated three opponents including [[Marko Tomasovi<U+0107> (boxer)|Marko Tomasovi<U+0107>]] of [[Croatia]] 23:11, Frenchman Mohamed Samoudi whom he stopped, Primislav Dimovski (Skopje) 20:4 but a hand injury kept him from showing for his fight against [[Roberto Cammarelle]]. GB head coach [[Terry Edwards]] said: "David has boxed particularly well in these World Championships and it is therefore a big disappointment that he was unable to box for automatic Olympic qualification here in Chicago, a right he had fought for."

=== 2008 Olympic Games ===

Two years after his Commonwealth Games success, Price captained the GB team who went to [[Beijing]] for the [[2008 Olympic Games]], beating Romanian World Junior Champion Cristian Ciocanu to qualify. Price met European Champion [[Islam Timurziev]] in the first round of the Olympics, and stopped the Russian in the second round after dropping him to the canvas on two occasions in the round, the scores were level at 2:2 at the time. The next round saw Price matched against Lithuanian [[Jaroslavas Jak<U+0161>to]] but Price progressed into the next round after Jak<U+0161>to retired with an injury at the end of the first round when the scorecards favored Price, 3:1. Guaranteed at least a bronze medal, David Price was to meet Italian world champion [[Roberto Cammarelle]], a bout in which the referee stopped in the second round when the scores favored the eventual Olympic gold medalist, Cammarelle, 10:1. The Englishman ended an impressive run at the Olympics with a bronze medal in the 91+kg Super-Heavyweight division. After winning a bronze medal, and not achieving the gold he sorely wanted, he announced his intention to turn professional.

==Professional career==

He stopped fellow British fighter Tom Dallas at the [[Liverpool Olympia]], inflicting a second round TKO propelling Price closer to a British Title shot. He scheduled a bout with [[John McDermott (boxer)|John McDermott]], due to take place on 5 November 2011, but Price was forced to pull out of the British and Commonwealth title eliminator with a rib injury which he suffered in sparring with former England team-mate [[Danny Price (boxer)|Danny Price]]. Price also sparred with fellow heavyweight [[David Haye]] before Haye's world title fight with Ukrainian [[Wladimir Klitschko]] in July 2011.

On 21 January 2012 David Price was fighting for the English Heavyweight title against an experienced fighter in [[John McDermott (boxer)|John McDermott]]. The winner of the bout would be the mandatory challenger against the British and Commonwealth Heavyweight champion, [[Tyson Fury]]; who many fans and pundits felt that McDermott won against in the first bout between the pair. It only took 73 seconds of the first round for Price to win against McDermott. Price knocked down McDermott 3 times before the referee, Howard John Foster, decided to end the bout; inflicting McDermott with a TKO defeat.

On 19 May 2012 at [[Aintree Racecourse]] in Liverpool, David Price beat [[Sam Sexton]] in a fourth round KO victory, and won the vacant British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles.

On 13 October 2012 he made his first defence of his British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles against fellow Olympian [[Audley Harrison]] at Liverpool<U+2019>s [[Echo Arena]] on the 'Battle of the Olympians' bill, with a comfortable first round knockout inside the opening 82 seconds. <ref>http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/david-price-fight-audley-harrison-093512044.html</ref> Immediately after the fight, it was confirmed that Price would box [[Matt Skelton]] on 30 November. He knocked out Skelton in the 2nd round of the fight.

As a result of his impressive performances in 2012, Price was named Prospect of the Year by [[ESPN.com]].<ref>http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/8784628/david-price</ref>

On 23 February 2013, Price lost his first professional fight, as he was stopped in two rounds by former world title challenger [[Tony Thompson (boxer)|Tony Thompson]]. After fighting cautiously for a round and a half, Thompson caught Price with a right hand behind the ear that sent Price crashing to the canvas. Although Price beat the count he was on unsteady legs, and the referee stopped the fight 2 minutes 17 seconds into the second round. <ref>{{cite news|last=Palvadori|first=Danny|title=David price loses to Tomy Thompson|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/boxing/9890421/David-Prices-heavyweight-title-dreams-left-in-ruins-after-second-round-defeat-to-Tony-Thompson.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=23 February 2013}}</ref>

On 6 July 2013, Price fought Thompson for the second time in five months. The result was similar as Price went down in defeat after the referee stopped the fight in the fifth round.<ref>{{cite news|title= David Price's career in trouble after second defeat to Tony Thompson|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/06/david-price-boxing|date=6 July 2013|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

On 5 December 2013 Price vacated his British and Commonwealth titles.<ref>{{cite news|title= David Price says he could still face Dereck Chisora in the future after vacating belts|url=http://www1.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/9057167/david-price-says-he-could-still-face-dereck-chisora-in-the-future-after-vacating-belts|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref>
