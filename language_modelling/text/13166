'''Stefan Czarniecki''' or '''Stefan <U+0141>odzia de Czarnca Czarniecki''' ([[1599]]-[[February 16]] [[1665]]) [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] general and [[szlachta| nobleman]]. Field [[Hetman]] of the Crown. He was a military commander, regarded as Polish national hero.  His status in [[Poland|Polish]] history is acknowledged by a mention of his name in the [[Mazurek Dabrowskiego|Polish national anthem]].

Born in family estate of [[Czarnca]] by [[W<U+0142>oszczowa]] in southern Poland. He learnt the art of war under [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Koniecpolski]] in the campaigns against [[Gustavus Adolphus]] ([[1626]]-[[1629]]) (part of the [[Polish-Swedish War]]), and under [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV]] in the [[Smolensk War]] against [[Muscovy]] in [[1633]]-[[1634]]. On the [[May 16]] [[1648]] he was one of the many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of [[Bohdan Chmielnicki]] at the [[battle of Yellow Waters]] and was sent in chains to the [[Crimea]], whence he was ransomed in [[1649]]. He took an active part in all the subsequent wars with the [[Cossacks]] and received more disfiguring wounds than any other commander. 

When [[Charles X of Sweden]] invaded Poland in [[1655]], Czarniecki distinguished himself by his defence of [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]. He led [[guerrilla warfare]] against Swedish troops of [[Charles X]], and though frequently worsted he from time to time inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes, notably at [[Jaroslaw]] and at [[Kozienice]] in [[1656]]. Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops ultimately proved successful. Czarniecki brought King [[John II Casimir of Poland]] back from exile and enabled him to regain his lost kingdom. It was against his advice that the [[Battle of Warsaw (1656)| Battle of Warsaw]] was fought, and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat.

On the retirement of the Swedes from [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] and [[Warsaw]], and the conclusion of the [[treaty of Copenhagen]] with the [[Danes]], he commanded the army corps sent to drive the troops of Charles X out of [[Jutland]] and contributed to the ultimate success of the [[Allies]]. On the conclusion of the [[Peace of Oliva| Peace of Oliwa]], which adjusted the long outstanding differences between Poland and Sweden, Czarniecki was transferred to the eastern frontier where [[Russo-Polish War (1654-1667)|the war with Russia was still raging]]. In the campaign of [[1660]] he won the victories of [[Battle of Po<U+0142>onka|Po<U+0142>onka]] and Lachowicza and penetrated to the heart of the enemy's country. 

In [[1661]], Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]) publicly thanked him for his services; the King John II Casimir heaped honours and riches upon him, and in [[1665]] he was appointed Field [[Hetman]] of the Crown (of Poland), but died a few days after receiving this supreme distinction.  

Czarniecki is regarded as one of the most famous of Poland's captains, and to him belongs the chief merit of extricating her from the difficulties which threatened to overwhelm her during the reign of John Casimir. 

He is interred in the tomb chapel of the church founded by him in [[Czarnca]].
