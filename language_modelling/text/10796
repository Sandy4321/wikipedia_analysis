The purpose of Hoppip in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pok<U+00E9>mon, is to battle both wild Pok<U+00E9>mon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pok<U+00E9>mon owned by [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer]]s.<ref name=ign> [http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire'' Review (page 1)] ''Ign.com''.

The name Hoppip is a combination of the words ''hop'', to jump with short leaps,<ref> [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hop ''Hop'' definition] ''Dictionary.com''. URL Accessed [[July 23]], [[2006]].</ref> and ''pip'', the term for small seeds within fruit.<ref> [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pip ''Pip'' definition] ''Dictionary.com''. URL Accessed [[July 23]], [[2006]].</ref> The names of the Hoppip family, Hoppip, [[Skiploom]] and [[Jumpluff]], come from words that all mean to leap high. The names also form a sort of pun from the phrase "A hop, a skip, and a jump away," meaning a short distance.<ref> [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=hop%2C%20skip%2C%20and%20a%20jump ''Hop, skip and a jump'' definition] ''Dictionary.com''.

They have small, gripping feet and ears disproportinate to their body, used to listen for winds.<ref name=DVD> ''Pokemon Johto Journeys, Volume 45 - Team Green''. Viz Video., [[September 25]], [[2001]]. ASIN B00005MM7D.</ref>

==Characteristics==
Hoppip have very light bodies, and are susceptible to strong winds due to this. When a Hoppip feels a gale approaching, it will lock the leaves on its head with the leaves of other Hoppip, in an attempt to not be blown away. If a Hoppip is by itself when in heavy winds, it may grip the ground with its feet to prevent this. Despite the dangers Hoppip face in strong winds, they enjoy gentle breezes and can float on the calmest of winds, which can even carry them vast distances.<ref> The in-game [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]]es of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (video games)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games]] ([http://www.psypokes.com/dex/pokedex.php?id=187&view=general A copy of them from ''Psypokes.com''.] URL Accessed [[July 23]], [[2006]].</ref>
