'''Thomas Dover''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (1660<U+2013>1742), sometimes referred to as "'''Doctor Quicksilver'''", was an [[English people|English]] physician. He is remembered for his [[common cold]] and [[fever]] medicine [[Dover's powder]], his work with the poor in [[Bristol]], and his [[privateer]]ing voyage alongside [[William Dampier]] and [[Woodes Rogers]] that rescued [[castaway]] [[Alexander Selkirk]], the real-life inspiration for [[Robinson Crusoe]].

==Early life and education==
Dover was born in [[Barton-on-the-Heath]], [[England]] in 1660, the son of a [[gentleman's farm|gentleman farmer]],<ref name="Morton">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1048430/pdf/brjvendis00098-0077.pdf|title=Dr Thomas ("Quicksilver") Dover, 1660-1742|work=British Journal of Venereal Diseases|first=R.

In 1687, he completed his [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]].<ref name="Morton" />

==Career==
He studied medicine under [[Thomas Sydenham]] in [[Pall Mall, London]]. During this time, he contracted [[smallpox]] and was treated with the "cooling method" by Sydenham,<ref name="Morton" /> described by Dover in his 1732 book ''Ancient Physician's Legacy to his Country'':
<blockquote>"I had no fire allowed in my room, my windows were constantly open, my bedclothes were ordered to be laid no higher than my waist. He made me take twelve bottles of small beer, acidulated with spirit of vitriol, every twenty-four hours."<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Dover, Thomas|last=Moore|first=Norman|authorlink=Sir Norman Moore, 1st Baronet|volume=15|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>

Dover married in 1681 and soon returned to Barton-on-the-Heath when his father became ill, taking care of the farm and working as a country practitioner. When his father died in 1696, Dover moved to Bristol, where he set up his own practice and worked with the [[Bristol Corporation of the Poor]] as an honorary physician at [[St Peter's Hospital (Bristol)|St. Peter's Hospital]].<ref name="Morton" /> There, he assisted the "Guardians of the Poor" with their [[poor relief]] efforts, becoming the first medical practitioner to offer services to the organisation.<ref name="Johnson">{{cite book|title=Transactions of the Corporation of the Poor, in the City of Bristol, During a Period of 126 Years|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-6kuAAAAYAAJ|first=James|last=Johnson|publisher=P. Rose|year=1826|page=108|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref>

Dover's own practice proved very lucrative. Bristol was a large city with very few physicians and many wealthy merchants and tradesmen. The spread of [[typhus]] added to his client list and meant that Dover was seeing up to 25 patients a day. He was soon able to afford his first house in the fashionable [[Queen Square, Bristol|Queen Square]],<ref name="Morton" /> home also to [[Woodes Rogers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolinformation.co.uk/srch/srchit.asp?gdoc=ls&first=1600&howmany=200&data=&field=&match=and&dir=Last+200&mde=list&category=all|title=Bristol Information|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> a sea captain with whom Dover would embark on a new career.<ref name="Johnson" />

===Privateering expedition===
{{further|Woodes Rogers#Privateering expedition}}
In 1702, Dover took a trip to the [[West Indies]]. This adventure clearly resonated with him; and, in the following years, he organised a more permanent career change.<ref name="Morton" /> In 1708, [[William Dampier]] arrived in Bristol hoping to secure a new [[privateer]] mission to capture a Spanish treasure ship.<ref name="Steeds" /> Dover bought into the plan, becoming part owner and second captain of the ''Duke'', a privateer under the command of Rogers.<ref name="Johnson" /> The doctor was styled "Captain Dover", having contributed <U+00A3>3,312 to the voyage, the second largest amount of thirty investors. Alongside this responsibility, Dover was given the role of president of the expedition council, allowing him two votes in all debates.<ref name="Morton" /> There were four surgeons, and he had no medical charge, but would need his skills later in the voyage.<ref name="DNB" />

On 1 August 1708, the ''Duke'' set sail alongside the ''Duchess'' on a privateering voyage.<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="Little">{{cite book|title=Crusoe's Captain|first=Brain|last=Little|year=1960|publisher=Odhams Press}}</ref> On 2 February 1709, a light was seen on the [[Juan Fern<U+00E1>ndez Islands]], and Dover led a landing party to investigate its source. They discovered a fire lit by [[Alexander Selkirk]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] sailor left on the island in 1705 because he considered the ship he was aboard, the ''[[Cinque Ports (1703 ship)|Cinque Ports]]'', as not being [[Seakeeping|seaworthy]]. The ''Cinque Ports'' was part of an expedition led by Dampier, which stopped for supplies at the [[archipelago]]. Selkirk's beliefs proved to be well founded; the ship sank one month later with few survivors. His four-year stay on the island and eventual rescue were the inspiration for the novel ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' written by [[Daniel Defoe]], a friend of Woodes Rogers.<ref name="Little" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4125577/Diaries-of-swashbuckling-hero-who-rescued-Robinson-Crusoe-unearthed.html|title=Diaries of swashbuckling hero who rescued Robinson Crusoe unearthed|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|work=The Telegraph|first=Nick|last=Britten|date=5 January 2009|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="Woodard">{{cite book|last=Woodard|first=Colin|year=2007|title=The Republic of Pirates|publisher=Harcourt Trade|isbn=978-0-15-101302-9}}</ref>

[[File:Guay.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the landing party in Guayaquil, searching Spanish ladies for their jewels]]
In April 1709 Dover led a landing party with entirely different intentions.<ref name="DNB" /> The two ships encountered the city of [[Guayaquil]] in what is now [[Ecuador]], and a raiding party was sent in. Dover's command was successful, and only two members of the crew were lost in the attack.<ref name="Morton" /> However, around 180 of those on the ships became extremely ill after digging up the town's graves in search of items of value.<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="Woodard" /> Dover returned to his medical roots and directed the surgeons in their work, ordering them to [[Bloodletting|bleed]] the ill in both arms and to give them a diluted [[sulphuric acid]] drink.<ref name="DNB" /> This regimen proved successful, and only a handful of sailors died.<ref name="DNB" /><ref name="Little" />

At one point during the voyage, the ships visited [[Java]], where Dover would sell the ''Marquis'', a captured ship, to Captain Opie. Opie would cross paths with Dover again later in life when he met and married Dover's daughter.<ref name="Steeds" /> The voyage was coming to an end when the privateers captured another prize whose captaincy was, after a heated debate amongst the council members, given to Dover.

The three-year expedition arrived home, and the prizes were shared out between the investors. Dover received a total of <U+00A3>6,689 (worth about <U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6689|1712|r=-2}}}} today),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} more than enough to secure a high position in society. The privateers had been labelled as [[piracy|pirates]], but the enactment of [[Prize (law)|The Prize Act]] in 1708 gave legal backing to their actions.<ref name="Morton" /> However, he was not yet ready to settle and embarked on a holiday across Europe.<ref name="Morton" />

===Return to medicine===
Dover re-established himself as a physician in Bristol before moving to [[Strand, London]] in 1720. Around this time his wife died and he lost most of his fortune due to bad investments including as much as  <U+00A3>6,000 in the collapse of the [[South Sea Company]].<ref name="Morton" /> In 1721 he was successful in his application to join the [[Royal College of Physicians]].<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="DNB" /> His past experience of contracting smallpox and the care he received from Sydenham suddenly became particularly relevant when there was an outbreak in London, with Dover successfully replicating the "cooling method".<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="Steeds" />

In 1729 he returned briefly to Bristol, spending much of his time writing a book that would become both successful and controversial. ''The Ancient Physician's Legacy to his Country'' was first published in 1732 after Dover had returned to London.<ref name="Morton" /> He saw patients at the popular Jerusalem coffee house.<ref name="DNB" />

Dover's medical book was aimed at the education of physicians and the general public. He gives descriptions of around 120 diseases, writing from his experiences and detailing his adventures as though the book were a travelogue. Though he shows some degree of wisdom regarding pharmacology,<ref name="Morton" /> his knowledge of medicine is described as being small<ref name="DNB" /> while his descriptions of some diseases are presented in the "flimsiest fashion" and "outrageous inaccuracies are set down with no little dogmatism".<ref name="Morton" /> Dover also makes many accusations of prejudice within the College of Physicians and writes several denigrating comments about his colleagues in general.<ref name="Morton" />

From his assertions in this book Dover acquired the nickname "Doctor Quicksilver". His recommendation of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (sometimes called ''quicksilver'') as a cure for numerous ills was challenged by several detractors. However, the popularity of the book and the forcefulness of Dover's character ensured that the use of mercury would be in vogue for many years. One anonymous report in 1733 challenges the use of the liquid metal as a cure for [[syphilis]] and starts hinting towards [[mercury poisoning]]:<ref name="Morton" />

<blockquote>"A young gentleman ... had the venereal disease caused by fast living. Dr Dover ordered the young gentleman to take crude mercury. At first he improved but later the patient had a violent [[dysentery]] which made an end of all his complaints and his life also".<ref name="Morton" /></blockquote>

The book was republished several times with the eighth and final edition being released twenty years after Dover's death. It was also translated into French.<ref name="Morton" /> The lasting contribution from within its pages is [[Dover's powder]], first recommended for its [[analgesic]] (painkilling) properties and then for its use as a [[diaphoretic]] (induces perspiration). The combination of [[opium]], [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|ipecacuanha]], and [[potassium sulfate|potassium sulphate]] (later [[liquorice]]) was over time adjusted in the constituent quantities but was in use for over 200 years.<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="DNB" />

==Retirement and death==
Dover's successes with his book and his powder helped to bring him back to financial solvency. In 1736 he moved into a house in Arundel Street with friend Robert Tracy, finally retiring in his eighties. He died there in 1742. Dover was buried in [[Stanway, Gloucestershire]] in the Tracy family vault.<ref name="Morton" /><ref name="DNB" /> Glenside Hospital museum maintains an exhibition about Dover.<ref name="Steeds" />
