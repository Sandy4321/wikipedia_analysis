==Early years==
Parrish attended [[East Stroudsburg South High School]] in [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]] where he played soccer for three years before joining the football team as a [[Punter (American football)|punter]] during his senior year. There, he earned All-[[Mountain Valley Conference]] and [[Pocono Record]] All-Area honors. He decided to join the football team after the schools' previous punter, [[Joseph Gaeta]], who later played football at [[Temple University]], became injured. He only had to punt three balls for the school's football coach before he was given the punting job for the rest of the season.

==College career==
After high school, Parrish attended [[East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania]] where he averaged 40.3 yards per punt and landed 59 of his 174 punts inside the 20-yard line during his college career. In his junior and senior year, he earned All-[[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference]] eastern division honors after averaging 42.5 yards per punt, with 30 of his 75 punts landing inside the 20 and just four touchbacks during that span. As a senior, he punted 42 times in 14 games to help ESU win the Division II Northeast Regional championship and advanced to the national semifinals for the first time in school history. As a senior, he averaged 42.0 yards per punt. As a junior, he averaged 43.2 yards per punt. As a sophomore, he averaged 40.7 yards per punt. As a freshman, he averaged 36.7 yards per punt. Parrish graduated East Stroudsburg with a degree in criminal justice.

==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers===

===First stint with Eagles===
Parrish signed with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] as a [[free agent]] on May 28, 2009. He was waived on August 8 after the team signed [[tight end]] [[Rob Myers]].

==Personal==
After getting released by the 49ers in 2007, Parrish spent eight months as a police officer with the Stroud Area Regional Police in his hometown, [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania]]. After the eight months, he decided that he would pursue a comeback into the NFL by leaving the police force. When asked about his decision to leave the police force, Parrish said, "It was a decision that took weeks and weeks and weeks and lots of discussions with my family. I always had great backing from my family. They [said], 'Ken, if you feel this is something you need to go out and conquer, then go ahead and do it.'"

Parrish moved to [[Modesto, California]] to perfect his punting, kickoffs, placekicks, and holding for placekicks in order to get ready for his comeback into the NFL.

After he was released by the Jets following training camp, Parrish worked as a substitute teacher at [[J T Lambert Intermediate]] and as a police officer again with the Stroud Area Regional Police.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kuhns, Mike |title=ESU grad Ken Parrish, newly signed by Eagles, featured on ESPN talk show |url=http://www.poconorecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100504/NEWS/100509953/-1/NEWS18 |publisher=''[[Pocono Record]]'' |date=May 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-15}}</ref>
