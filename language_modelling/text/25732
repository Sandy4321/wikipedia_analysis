The present church, built in 1835, bears the same dedication as the shrine erected in this place between the end of the fifth and the beginning of the sixth century. After several renovations, this building was destructed in the first half of the fifteenth century by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. The complex got its name from a nearby holy source, the <U+0396><U+03C9><U+03BF><U+03B4><U+03CC><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03A0><U+03B7><U+03B3><U+03AE> ([[Greek language|Greek]]:"Life-giving spring"), reputed to have healing properties. Since almost fifteen hundred years this sanctuary constitutes one of the most important pilgrimage sites of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] [[Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]].<ref name=ja232>Janin (1953), p. 232. </ref>

==Location==
The church is located in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Zeytinburnu]], in the neighbourhood of [[Bal<U+0131>kl<U+0131>, Istanbul|Bal<U+0131>kl<U+0131>]], along ''Bal<U+0131>kl<U+0131> Sivrikap<U+0131> Sokak''. It lies a few hundred meters outside the [[walls of Constantinople|walled]] city, about five hundred meters from the Gate of [[Silivri]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Silivri Kap<U+0131>s<U+0131>''). The complex is protected by a high wall, and <U+2013> being surrounded by Eastern Orthodox and Armenian cemeteries <U+2013> lies in a green landscape.

==History==
[[File:File-SaintMaryOfTheSource20101009 02.jpg|300px|thumb|The Hagiasma.]]
According to historians [[Procopius]] and [[Cedrenus]], the church was originally erected by [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Justinian]] in the last years of his reign (559-560) near a fountain of [[Holy water in Eastern Christianity|holy water]] ({{lang-el|{{Polytonic|<U+1F01><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03B1>}}}}, ''hagiasma'', whence {{lang-tr|ayazma}}) situated outside the [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|walls of Theodosius II]] in correspondence of today's [[Walls_of_constantinople#Gate_of_the_Spring|Gate of Silivri]]. <ref> After the erection of the sanctuary this Gate was named by the Byzantines ''Gate of the Spring'' or ''P<U+0113>g<U+0113>'' Gate (<U+03A0><U+03CD><U+03BB><U+03B7> <U+03C4><U+1FC6><U+03C2> <U+03A0><U+03B7><U+03B3><U+1FC6><U+03C2>)</ref> During hunting the Emperor noticed a small chapel surrounded by many women.<ref name=ja233>Janin (1953), p. 233</ref> Asking the meaning of the building, he was told that this was the <U+201C>source of the miracles<U+201D>. He ordered at once to build there a magnificent church with the material remained after the erection of the [[Hagia Sophia]].<ref name=ja233/>

According to a later legend the sanctuary was erected by Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] (r. 457<U+2013>474) because of a miracle occurred when he was still a soldier. Before entering the City, Leo met a blind man who asked him to give him water. A female voice ordered the future Emperor to wet the eyes of the blind man with the water of a nearby swamp. The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and that he would have gotten the empire. Leo followed her order and the blind man recovered at once his eyesight. After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place.<ref name=ja233/> This legend is possibly a later invention of the monks of the sanctuary. It is anyway possible that before the erection of the edifice of Justinian a small monastery had already existed there.<ref name=ja233/>

The building underwent many repairs along the centuries. The most important were in 790, under [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]], and <U+2013> after the great earthquake of 869 <U+2013> under [[Basil I]] (r. 867<U+2013>886).<ref name=ja233/> On 7 September 924  Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] burned the complex, which was at once restored by [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] (r. 920<U+2013>944).<ref name=ma208>Mamboury (1953), p. 208</ref> Three years later the son of Simeon, [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter]] was married there to [[Eirene Lakapena|Maria]], the niece of the Emperor.<ref name=ja234>Janin (1953), p. 234</ref><ref name=ma208/>

After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin invasion of 1204]], the church was occupied by the Latin clergy, and according to Byzantine sources this caused the end of the so called "habitual miracle" (''to synet<U+00E9>s thauma'').<ref name=ja234/>

During the [[Siege of Constantinople (1422)|Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1422]], Sultan [[Murad II]] camped in the sanctuary. It is unknown whether the Byzantines restored the building before the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of the city]] in 1453 <ref name=ja235>Janin (1953), p. 235</ref> The Russian pilgrims of the fifteenth century do not mention the church, but only the source. The 16th-century French scholar [[Pierre Gilles]] writes that in 1547 the church did not exist anymore, but the sick continued to attend the source. <ref name=ja235>Janin (1953), p. 235.</ref>

[[File:Panagia Argokiliotissa1.JPG|thumb|Modern Greek [[icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] of the Life-giving Spring. The representation shows some differences with respect to the ancient type]]
In 1727 Nikodemos, [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of [[Delcus|Dercos and Neochorion]], built a small chapel above the Hagiasma. An icon, discovered in the foundations of the old church, at that time still existing, was worshiped in the chapel. The [[Armenians]] tried to take possession of the source, but several [[Firman (decree)|firmans]] secured the possession to the Greeks. The complex was controlled by Turkish guardians, who collected from the pilgrims a tax used for the maintenance of the prisons. Later the complex came into possession of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate]], until in 1821 the [[Janissaries]] destroyed the chapel and poisoned the source. In 1833 a firman allowed [[Ecumenical Patriarch Constantius I of Constantinople|Patriarch Constantius I]] to rebuild the church, which was inaugurated in 1835.<ref name=ja235/> 

The church was heavily damaged during the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] on 6 September 1955, but since then it has been restored.

The sanctuary is directed by a titular bishop and is one of the most popular among the Orthodox of Istanbul, who visit it especially during the [[Easter Friday|Friday after Easter]]<ref name=ma208/> and on September 14. In these two days a great feast, both profane and religious takes place there.<ref name=ja235/> Funerals of people to be buried in the nearby cemetery are also celebrated in the church.

In Byzantine times the sanctuary was one of the most important in Constantinople. On [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension Day]] the Emperor arrived by boat to the small harbor of the [[Walls_of_constantinople#Golden_Gate_and_the_Yedikule_Fortress|Golden Gate]]. He rode up to the sanctuary, where he was acclaimed by the factions who offered him a cross and garlands. Later he dressed his ceremony robe in its apartments and, after receiving the Patriarch, the two entered the church hand-in-hand.<ref name=ja234/> After the celebration, he invited the Patriarch for dinner.<ref name=ja234/>

Each future Empress coming to Constantinople for her wedding was received by her future spouse in the monastery of the Source. <ref name=ja235/>

The dedication feast of the church took place on July 9. Moreover, the Ascension, the [[Marriage at Cana]] (8 January) and the anniversary of the Miracle of Leo I on 16 August were celebrated here.<ref name=ja235/>

The Life-giving spring gave origin to many churches and monasteries bearing the same name in the Greek world, but most of them were erected after the end of the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=ja237>Janin (1953), p. 237</ref> 

The [[icon]] that represents the Virgin of the source shows the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin]] blessing and embracing the Child. She is surrounded by two angels and usually is sitting on the more elevated of two basins which are sustained by a water jet coming from a larger marble basin adorned with a cross. Around this, stands the Emperor with his guard, while on the left there is the Patriarch with his bishops. On the background, is represented Leo I with the blind man together with the walls of the City. Under the basin a paralytic and a mad are healed with the source<U+2019>s water.<ref name=ja237/>

== Description ==
[[File:SaintMaryOfTheSource20101009 03.jpg|300px|thumb|The Interior of the Church.]]
According to [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos|Nikephoros Kallistos]] (writing in fourteenth century) the church by that time had a rectangular shape of [[basilica]] type, with a 4:3 proportion between the sides, and was partly subterranean. <ref name=ja236>Janin (1953), p. 236.</ref> It was surrounded by two [[Narthex|exonartheces]] (on the E and W side)  and two [[Narthex|esonarteces]] (on the S and N sides). The light coming from outside was concentrated on the source, which could be reached descending two stairs having 25 steps. Each stair was delimited by a marble balustrade and surmounted by a marble arcade. The water fell into a marble basin, and a canalization distributed it in the church.  <ref name=ja236>Janin (1953), p. 236.</ref> The edifice was adorned with frescos and surmounted by a dome glittering with pure gold. Around the church there were three chapels, devoted respectively to [[Saint Eustratius]], the Theotokos and [[Saint Anne]].

The present church is also rectangular in shape. It is roughly oriented in  E - W direction, and has three naves divided by columns and preceded by an esonarthex. By the Northwest corner rises a metallic bell tower. The interior is richly adorned. On the right side near the middle of the nave there is a [[Pulpit]], while at the end lies a rich [[iconostasis]]. Right of the iconostasis there is an icon which the tradition says painted by [[Saint Luke]]. <ref name=ma208>Mamboury (1953), p. 208.</ref> The source lies in a subterranean [[crypt]] outside the church, <ref name=ma208>Mamboury (1953), p. 208.</ref> and can be accessed descending a stair parallel the long sides of the church. A symmetric stair leads from the crypt to the church<U+2019>s yard. The crypt is adorned with paintings and icons, and is surmounted by a dome painted with Christ in a starry sky. The water flows into a marble basin, where fishes are swimming. These fishes, present in the basin since centuries, gave origin to the Turkish name of the complex (''balikli'' in Turkish means "place where there are fishes").  <ref name=ma208>Mamboury (1953), p. 208.</ref> According to a late legend, the day of the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] a monk was frying fishes in a pan near the source. When a colleague announced him the fall of the City, he replied that he would have believed him only if the fishes in the pan would have come back to life. After its words these jumped in the source and began swimming. <ref name=ma208>Mamboury (1953), p. 208.</ref>

The yard in front of a church is a cemetery with marble tombs <U+2013> mostly of them dating to the nineteenth and twentieth century - belonging to wealthy ''[[Rum (disambiguation)|Rum]]'' of Istanbul. Also several Patriarchs are buried here. The complex is also surrounded by two large cemeteries, respectively Armenian and Greek, each enclosed in high walls.

About one kilometer south of the church is active an important Greek hospital, the ''Balikli Rum Hastanesi Vakf'' (<U+201C>Balikli<U+2019>s Greek Hospital Foundation<U+201D>) .
