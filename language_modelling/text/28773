'''William Franklin "Bill" Conkright''' (April 17, 1914 <U+2013> October 27, 1980), known more commonly by the nickname '''Red''', was an [[American football]] [[Center (American football)|center]] and [[Wide receiver|end]] who played eight seasons in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and was later the head coach of the [[Oakland Raiders]] for part of the 1962 season.

Conkright was born in [[Oklahoma]] and attended the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he was a star center on the school's [[Oklahoma Sooners football|football team]]. He was the captain of the Sooners team in 1936 and was named to a first-team all-[[Big Six Conference]] squad. Conkright was drafted in 1937 by the NFL's [[Chicago Bears]]. He played two seasons for the Bears, serving mainly as a backup center and occasionally playing as an end. The [[Cleveland Rams]] bought the rights to Conkright in 1939, and he stayed with the team through the 1942 season. He played for the [[Washington Redskins]] and [[Brooklyn Dodgers (NFL)|Brooklyn Dodgers]] in 1943 before returning to the Rams briefly in 1944.

Following his retirement as a player, Conkright began a career as a coach. He scouted and coached for the Rams in 1944 and 1945, and moved to the [[Cleveland Browns]] of the new [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC) in 1946. He worked as an assistant coach for two more AAFC teams in the late 1940s. Conkright was hired as an assistant at  [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State College]] in 1950, spending two seasons in the position. After a five-year hiatus from coaching, he returned as an assistant for the [[University of Houston]]'s football team. He got his first head coaching job in 1959 at [[Stephen F. Austin State University]]. In 1962, Conkright was hired as an assistant coach and director of player personnel by the [[Oakland Raiders]] in the [[American Football League]]. The team's head coach, [[Marty Feldman (American football)|Marty Feldman]], was fired in the middle of the season and Conkright replaced him. Conkright's Raiders, however, managed to win just one game that year, and he was replaced in 1963 by [[Al Davis]]. Conkright went on to work for two years as an assistant with the [[Houston Oilers]].
