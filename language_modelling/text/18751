[[Image:Lightning3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lightning is one of the most prominent effects of electricity]]
'''Electricity''' (from [[New Latin]] ''<U+0113>lectricus'', "[[amber|amber-like]]") is a general term that encompasses a variety of phenomena resulting from the presence and flow of [[electric charge]]. These include many easily recognisable phenomena such as [[lightning]] and [[static electricity]], but in addition, less familiar concepts such as the [[electromagnetic field]] and [[electromagnetic induction]].

In general usage, the word 'electricity' is adequate to refer to a number of physical effects. However, in scientific usage, the term is vague, and these related, but distinct, concepts are better identified by more precise terms:

* '''[[Electric charge]]''' &ndash; a property of some [[subatomic particle]]s, which determines their [[electromagnetic interaction]]s. Electrically charged matter is influenced by, and produces, electromagnetic fields.
*'''[[Electric current]]''' &ndash; a movement or flow of electrically charged particles, typically measured in [[ampere]]s. 
*'''[[Electric field]]''' &ndash; an influence produced by an electric charge on other charges in its vicinity.
*'''[[Electric potential]]''' &ndash; the capacity of an electric field to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], typically measured in [[volts]].
* '''[[Electromagnetism]]''' &ndash; a [[fundamental interaction]] between the electric field and the presence and motion of electric charge.

Electricity has been studied since antiquity, though scientific advances were not forthcoming until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It would remain however until the late nineteenth century that [[Electrical engineering|engineers]] were able to put electricity to industrial and residential use, a time which witnessed a rapid expansion in the development of electrical technology. Electricity's extraordinary versatility as a source of energy means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include [[motive power|transport]], [[HVAC|heating]], [[electric lighting|lighting]], [[telecommunications|communications]], and [[computation]]. The backbone of modern industrial society is, and for the foreseeable future can be expected to remain, the use of electrical power.<ref>

That certain objects such as rods of [[amber]] could be rubbed with cat's fur and attract light objects like feathers was known to ancient cultures around the Mediterranean and Middle East.

{{Main|Electric charge}}
{{seealso|electron|proton|ion}}
Electric charge is a property of certain [[subatomic particle]]s, which gives rise to and interacts with, the [[electromagnetic force]], one of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature. Charge originates in the [[atom]], in which its most familiar carriers are the [[electron]] and [[proton]]. It is a [[conserved quantity]], that is, the net charge within an [[isolated system]] will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system.<ref>

</ref> A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with an rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated by [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]] in the late eighteenth century, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms, leading to the well-known axiom: ''like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract''.<ref name=uniphysics/>  

The force acts on the charged particles themselves, hence charge has a tendency to spread itself as evenly as possible over a conducting surface. The magnitude of the electromagnetic force, whether attractive or repulsive, is given by [[Coulomb's Law]], which relates the force to the product of the charges and has an [[inverse square]] relation to the distance between them.<ref>"The repulsive force between two small spheres charged with the same type of electricity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centres of the two spheres."

Charge can be measured by a number of means, an early instrument being the [[gold-leaf electroscope]], which although still in use for classroom demonstrations, has been superseded by the electronic [[electrometer]].<ref name=duffin/>

=== Electric current ===
{{Main|Current (electricity)}}   
The movement of electric charge is known as an [[electric current]], the intensity of which is usually measured in [[ampere]]s. Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current.

By historical convention, a positive current is defined as having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called [[conventional current]]. The motion of negatively-charged electrons around an [[electric circuit]], one of the most familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the ''opposite'' direction to that of the electrons.<ref>
{{Citation
| first = Robert | last = Ward

| year = 1960}}
</ref> However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of [[charged particle]]s in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation. If another definition is used&mdash;for example, "electron current"&mdash;it needs to be explicitly stated.

[[Image:Lichtbogen 3000 Volt.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An [[electric arc]] provides an energetic demonstration of electric current]]
The process by which electric current passes through a material is termed [[electrical conduction]], and its nature varies with that of the charged particles and the material through which they are travelling. Examples of electric currents include metallic conduction, where electrons flow through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] such as metal, and [[electrolysis]], where [[ion]]s (charged [[atom]]s) flow through liquids. While the particles themselves can move quite slowly, sometimes with a [[drift velocity]] only fractions of a millimetre per second,<ref name=duffin>

Current causes several observable effects, which historically were the means of recognising its presence. That water could be decomposed by the current from a voltaic pile was discovered by [[William Nicholson (chemist)|Nicholson]] and [[Anthony Carlisle|Carlisle]] in 1800, a process now known as [[electrolysis]].

In engineering or household applications, current is often described as being either [[direct current]] (DC) or [[alternating current]] (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time.

</ref> Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time.

=== Electric field ===
{{Main|Electric field}}
{{seealso|Electrostatics}}
The concept of the electric [[Field (physics)|field]] was introduced by [[Michael Faraday]]. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges in a similar manner to the way that the gravitational field acts between two [[mass]]es, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance.<ref name=Umashankar/> However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much the weaker.<ref name=hawking/>

[[Image:Field lines.svg|thumb|right|240px|Field lines emanating from a positive charge above a plane conductor]]
An electric field generally varies in space,<ref>Almost all electric fields vary in space. An exception is the electric field surrounding a planar conductor of infinite extent, the field of which is uniform.</ref> and its strength at any one point is defined as the force (per unit charge) that ''would'' be felt by a stationary, negligible charge ''if'' placed at that point.<ref name=uniphysics_469>

</ref> The conceptual charge, termed a ''test charge'', must be vanishingly small to prevent its own electric field disturbing the main field and must also be stationary to prevent the effect of [[magnetic field]]s. As the electric field is defined in terms of [[force]], and force is a [[vector]], so it follows that an electric field is also a vector, having both [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]]. Specifically, it is a [[vector field]].<ref name=uniphysics_469/>

The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called [[electrostatics]]. The field may be visualised by a set of lines whose direction at any point is the same as that of the field. This concept was introduced by Faraday, whose term '[[Line of force|lines of force]]' still sometimes sees use. The field lines are the paths that a point positive charge would seek to make as it was forced to move within the field. Field lines emanating from stationary charges have several key properties: first, that they originate at positive charges and terminate at negative charges; second, that they must enter any good conductor at right angles, and third, that they may never cross nor close in on themselves.<ref>

The principals of electrostatics are important when designing items of [[high voltage|high-voltage]] equipment. There is a finite limit to the electric field strength that may withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, [[electrical breakdown]] occurs and an [[electrical arc]] causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc at electric field strengths which exceed 30&nbsp;kV per centimetre across small gaps. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1&nbsp;kV per centimetre.<ref name=hv_eng>

=== Electric potential ===
{{Main|Electric potential}}
{{seealso|Voltage}}
[[Image:Panasonic-oxyride.jpg|thumb|upright|A pair of [[AA battery|AA cells]]. The +&nbsp;sign indicates the terminal with the highest electric potential.]]
The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires [[Mechanical work|work]]. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an [[infinity|infinite distance]] slowly to that point. It is usually measured in [[volt]]s, and one volt is the potential for which one [[joule]] of work must be expended to bring a charge of one [[coulomb]] from infinity.<ref name=uniphysics_494>

</ref> This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of electric [[potential difference]], and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is [[Conservative force|''conservative'']], which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated.<ref name=uniphysics_494/> The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term [[voltage]] sees greater everyday usage.

For practical purposes, it is useful to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the [[Earth]] itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] or [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged &ndash; and unchargeable.<ref>

Electric potential is a [[scalar quantity]], that is, it has only magnitude and not direction. It may be viewed as analogous to [[temperature]]: as there is a certain temperature at every point in space, and the [[temperature gradient]] indicates the direction and magnitude of the driving force behind [[heat flow]], similarly, there is an electric potential at every point in space, and its [[gradient]], or field strength, indicates the direction and magnitude of the driving force behind charge movement. Equally, electric potential may be seen as analogous to [[height]]: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field.<ref>

The electric field was formally defined as the force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the electric field is the local gradient of the electric potential.

<U+00D8>rsted's discovery in 1821 that a [[magnetic field]] existed around all sides of a wire carrying an electric current indicated that there was a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. Moreover, the interaction seemed different to gravitational and electrostatic forces, the two forces of nature then known. The force on the compass needle did not direct it to or away from the current-carrying wire, but acted at right angles to it.<ref name=berkson/> <U+00D8>rsted's slightly obscure words were that "the electric conflict acts in a revolving manner." The force also depended on the direction of the current, for if the flow was reversed, then the force did too.<ref>

<U+00D8>rsted did not fully understand his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by [[Andr<U+00E9>-Marie Amp<U+00E8>re|Amp<U+00E8>re]], who discovered that two parallel current carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents in the same direction are attracted to each other, while wires containing current flowing in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces.<ref>

[[Image:Electric motor cycle 3.png|thumb|The electric motor exploits an important effect of electromagnetism: a current flowing through a magnetic field experiences a force at right angles to both the field and current]]
This relationship between magnetic fields and currents is extremely important, for it led to Michael Faraday's invention of the [[electric motor]] in 1821. Faraday's [[homopolar motor]] consisted of a [[permanent magnet]] sitting in a pool of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. A current was allowed to flow through a wire suspended from a pivot above the magnet and dipped into  the mercury. The magnet exerted a tangential force on the wire, making it circle around the magnet for as long as current was maintained.<ref name=iet_faraday>

Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 revealed that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as [[electromagnetic induction]], enabled him to state the principal, now known as [[Faraday's law of induction]], that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit is proportional to the rate of change of [[magnetic flux]] through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first [[electrical generator]] in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy.<ref name=iet_faraday/> [[Faraday's disc]] was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.

Faraday's and Amp<U+00E8>re's work showed that a time-varying magnetic field acted as a source of an electric field, and a time-varying electric field was a source of a magnetic field. Thus, when either field is changing in time, then a field of the other is necessarily induced.<ref name=uniphysics_696-700>

</ref> Such a phenomenon has the properties of a [[wave]], and is naturally referred to as an [[electromagnetic wave]]. Electromagnetic waves were analysed theoretically by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1864. Maxwell discovered a set of equations that could unambiguously describe the interrelationship between electric field, magnetic field, electric charge, and electric current. He could moreover prove that such a wave would necessarily travel at the [[speed of light]], and thus light itself was a form of electromagnetic radiation. [[Maxwell's Laws]], which unify light, fields, and charge are one of the great milestones of theoretical physics.<ref name=uniphysics_696-700/>

==Electric circuits==
{{main|Electric circuit}}
[[Image:Ohms law voltage source.svg|thumb|200px|left|A basic [[electric circuit]]. The [[voltage source]] ''V'' on the left drives a [[Current (electricity)|current]] ''I'' around the circuit, delivering [[electrical energy]] into the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] ''R''. From the resistor, the current returns to the source, completing the circuit.]]
An electric circuit is an interconnection of electric components, usually to perform some useful task, with a return path to enable the charge to return to its source.

The components in an electric circuit can take many forms, which can include elements such as [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, [[switch]]es, [[transformer]]s and [[electronics]]. [[Electronic circuit]]s contain [[active component]]s, usually [[semiconductor]]s, and typically exhibit [[non-linear]] behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components are those that are termed [[passivity|passive]] and [[linearity|linear]]: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.<ref name=ec_3>

The [[resistor]] is perhaps the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it [[Electrical resistance|resists]] the flow of current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. [[Ohm's law]] is a basic law of [[circuit theory]], stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The [[ohm]], the unit of resistance, was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter <U+03A9>. 1&nbsp;<U+03A9> is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.<ref name=ec_3/>

The [[capacitor]] is a device capable of storing charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. Conceptually, it consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the [[capacitance]]. The unit of capacitance is the [[farad]], named after Faraday, and given the symbol ''F'': one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current to flow as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a [[steady-state]] current to flow, but instead blocks it.<ref name=ec_3/>

The [[inductor]] is a conductor, usually a coil of wire, that stores energy in a magnetic field in response to the current flowing through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, [[electromagnetic induction|inducing]] a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the [[Time derivative|time rate of change]] of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the [[inductance]]. The unit of inductance is the [[Henry (unit)|henry]], named after [[Joseph Henry]], a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second.<ref name=ec_3/> The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current to flow, but opposes the flow of a rapidly changing one.

The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the [[Battery (electricity)|electrical battery]], store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy.<ref name=batteries/> The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted in bulk.

Electrical energy is usually generated by electro-mechanical [[electrical generator|generators]] powered by combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, or the heat released from [[nuclear energy|nuclear reactions]], but also from other sources such as [[kinetic energy]] extracted from wind or flowing water. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends.<ref>

Electricity is used within [[telecommunications]], and indeed the [[electrical telegraph]], demonstrated commercially in 1837 by [[William Fothergill Cooke|Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone|Wheatstone]], was one of its earliest applications. With the construction of first [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|intercontinental]], and then [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic]], telegraph systems in the 1860s, electricity had enabled communications in minutes across the globe. [[Optical fibre]] and [[Communications satellite|satellite communication]] technology have taken a share of the market for communications systems, but electricity can be expected to remain an essential part of the process.

The effects of electromagnetism are most visibly employed in the [[electric motor]], which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a [[winch]] is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an [[electric vehicle]], is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or by to collect current from a sliding contact such as the [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], placing restrictions on its range or performance.

Electronic devices make use of the [[transistor]], perhaps one of the most important inventions of the twentieth century,<ref>
