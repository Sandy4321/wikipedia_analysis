'''Relative Value Units''' ('''RVUs''') are a measure used in the healthcare field, and comprise part of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reimbursement formula.

Physician services, which are described by [[Current Procedural Terminology]] (CPT) codes and [[Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System]] (HCPCS) codes, range from those that require considerable amounts of physician time and effort, clinical staff, and specialized equipment, to those that require little if any physician time and minimal other resources. For each service, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] determines RVUs for three types of resources. '''Physician work RVUs''' account for the time, technical skill and effort, mental effort and judgment, and stress to provide a service. '''Practice expense RVUs''' account for the nonphysician clinical and nonclinical labor of the practice, as well as expenses for building space, equipment, and office supplies. '''Professional liability insurance RVUs''' account for the cost of malpractice insurance premiums.
