'''Mount Pleasant Road''' is a major [[arterial thoroughfare]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] city of [[Toronto]] that travels from [[Jarvis Street]] south of [[Bloor Street]] north to Forest Glen Crescent. The road is unique as one of the few arterial roads in Toronto to be created after the development of [[List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|the suburbs]] which it passes through. These include the wealthy [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]] and [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]] neighbourhoods. The road also passes through the centre of [[Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto|Mount Pleasant Cemetery]], after which it takes its name.

Mount Pleasant Road was first established in 1915 when the city of Toronto, having recently annexed Moore Park, purchased the [[right of way (transportation)|right-of-way]] for a new road through the Mount Pleasant Cemetery. This road opened to traffic in 1919, between [[St. Clair Avenue]] and Blythwood Ravine. Several streets were absorbed into the length of Mount Pleasant Road in 1919, 1920 and 1935; the later as part of a northward extension through Lawrence Park. In the late 1940s, what originally began as the ''Clifton Road Extension'' opened a new right-of-way between St. Clair Avenue and Jarvis Street, despite opposition from the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] (TTC) bringing the road to its current length of {{convert|7.7|km|abbr=on}}. This extension is considered Toronto's first expressway.

The road forks to the northeast and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale Ravine. It passes through South Rosedale, entering a trench and passing beneath Crescent Drive. The road descends into the [[David A. Balfour]] ravine along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank of the ravine, entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, crosses the old [[Belt Line Railway]] trail, and zig-zags northeast into [[Davisville, Toronto|Davisville Village]].<ref name="TandA">{{cite map

Continuing north and resuming its straight northward course, Mount Pleasant passes through an historic commercial strip, then meets [[Eglinton Avenue]] East. It passes into a primarily residential area, though several auto service shops exist along this stretch, as well as [[Northern Secondary School]]. The road jogs slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small [[Burke's Brook]].<ref name="TandA" /> After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets [[Lawrence Avenue East]]. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage [[traffic signal]], directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as a [[collector road]] and is a wide residential street with several stop signs.<ref name="streetclass" /> The road ends at a corner on the edge of the [[Don River (Ontario)|West Don Valley]], where it becomes Forest Glen Crescent.<ref name="TandA" />

== History ==
[[File:Mount Pleasant Road south to Merton Street 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Alberta Avenue was a short muddy street which was incorporated into the [[right-of-way (transportation)|alignment]] of Mount Pleasant Road by 1919]]
Mount Pleasant Road was constructed over the course of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well as building a new road in other places. The outward growth of Toronto presented an ever increasing need for a dedicated burial ground. The Toronto General Burying Grounds Trust was formed by the owners of the Potter's Field cemetery, which lay at the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor. As the cemetery blocked the growth of [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]], the village pressured the province to move the interred to a new burial ground. The trust purchased [[Toronto Necropolis|The Necropolis]]. As Toronto continued to grow, the need for a new cemetery grew. As a result, the trust purchased a {{convert|0.81|sqkm|acre|abbr=on}} farm north of Deer Park. The new grounds, named Mount Pleasant Cemetery, opened to the public on November 4, 1876.<ref>{{cite web

Thereafter, the "outer suburbs" of Rosedale, Deer Park, North Toronto and Moore Park grew, being annexed by the City of Toronto in 1905, 1908 and the latter two in 1912.<ref>{{cite book

By this point in time, a road existed to the north and south of the cemetery. The road to the south, running between Clarence Avenue (renamed Heath Street East in 1914) and Moore Avenue, was known as Kinsman Avenue (marked as 'Lyle' on some maps). The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.<ref>{{cite map

[[File:Mount Pleasant bridge at Bloor.png|thumb|left|Despite opposition by the TTC, an underpass was constructed at Bloor Street]]
In an attempt to improve the flow of traffic coming from within the city, the operators of Mount Pleasant Cemetery were approached beginning in 1912 with the goal of opening a new right-of-way through the property. The operators initially refused, prompting the city to pass By-law 7311 in March 1915, which allowed for the expropriation of the cemetery property. Over the next several months, the city and the Toronto General Burying Grounds Trustees bargained over the price of the land, settling for the extraordinary sum of $98,921.88 ($2,090,000, adjusted for inflation) by July; construction began the following spring.<ref name="MPC" /> The route through Moore Park incorporated a small street known as Kinsman Avenue (marked as Lyle on earlier maps), while north of the cemetery, the short Alberta Avenue between Merton Street And Balliol Street was absorbed.<ref name="1916 map">{{cite map

By the end of 1920, Mount Pleasant Road existed between St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at the rim of the Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, the road on the opposite rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920.<ref name="1916 map" /> The construction of the Vale of Avoca through the first half of the 1920s prompted the newly formed [[Toronto Transit Commission]] to extend the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road and then north to Eglinton Avenue. The road was paved at this time as far north as Eglinton.

Between 1934 and 1936, after gaining approval from Lawrence Park developers, a bridge was constructed over the ravine and Mount Pleasant extended north to Lawrence Avenue. In 1935, Hilda Avenue was renamed, extending Mount Pleasant Road north to Forest Glen Crescent.<ref name="1916 map" />

=== Clifton Road Extension ===
[[File:Clifton Road Extension.png|thumb|right|Grading was well underway on the Clifton Road Extention in September 1948]]
In November 1945, at the recommendation of the planning board, in an effort to improve traffic flow outward from the downtown core, city council initiated what would come to be known as the ''Clifton Road Extension''.<ref>{{cite report

Prior to the opening of this route, a road travelled southwest from the intersection of Inglewood Drive and Clifton Road into the ravine, crossed Yellow Creek, and climbed up the opposite slope north to the corner of Avoca Avenue and Rosehill Drive; most of this route exists as a recreational path today.  Roxborough Drive also crossed the ravine along the same route as Mount Pleasant today.<ref name="1916 map" /> A third route followed MacLennan Avenue north across the CPR tracks, ascending the steep MacLennan Hill. A decades-old contract signed with CPR required the closing of the MacLennan Avenue crossing if a road should ever pass beneath the tracks.<ref name="MacLennan">{{cite news

The Maclennan Hill was a dangerous and steep bottleneck for traffic leaving the inner city. The first recommendations involved creating an underpass beneath the CPR tracks. A vote was held on January 1, 1946, with an overwhelming majority of voters approving the project.<ref>{{cite report

After several months of negotiation with residents of South Rosedale, bylaw 16622 formally approved the extension of Clifton Road to Jarvis Street on June 24, 1946.<ref>{{cite report

Residents of Moore Park, opposed to the notion of widening their small residential street, approached city council in September 1948 to request the new extension connect to Mount Pleasant Road instead. A petition of residents followed, and city council accepted the recommendations. Bylaw 17489, passed February 7, 1949, formally approved the project. Despite the loss of ten houses, this plan was carried out.<ref>{{cite report

Construction included a new bridge excavated at the intersection of Huntley and Jarvis Streets, requiring the TTC to divert its streetcar tracks to the south. The closing of the MacLennan Avenue CPR crossing resulted in the construction of a pedestrian overpass. Traffic descending the MacLennan Hill west directed west along a new road to Mount Pleasant.<ref name="MacLennan" />
On January 23, 1950, the Clifton Road Extension was renamed Mount Pleasant Road.<ref>{{cite report
