== Biography ==
Born '''Alice Costandina Titus''' into a Greek family in [[Thomasville, Georgia]], she grew up in [[Tifton, Georgia]]. Raised as a "[[Southern belle]]", active in [[tap dancing]] and [[cheerleading]], she was nevertheless part of a political family; a grandfather was a [[United States Representative]], an uncle was in the [[Georgia General Assembly]],  and her father ran for mayor of Tifton.

Always a strong student, Dina was admitted to the [[College of William and Mary]] solely on the strength of her test scores and high school grades (before ever being able to complete high school), from which she graduated in 1970 with a [[B.A.]] in American government. Titus went on to receive a master's degree from the [[University of Georgia]] and a doctorate in [[political science]] from [[Florida State University]]. In [[1977]], the newly-minted Ph.D. then came to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to teach political science at UNLV.

A term as a staffer <!-- position? --> in US Senator [[Howard Cannon]]'s office interested Titus in Democratic Party politics, and so she ran for the State Senate in [[1988]], winning a seat. She represents District 7, which includes most of the [[Las Vegas Strip]] from Sahara Avenue down to and including [[McCarran International Airport]]. 

On August 15, 2006 Titus defeated [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] Mayor [[James B. Gibson|Jim Gibson]] to secure the Democratic nomination for the upcoming gubernatorial election.  During her campaign, she participated in a debate at the University of Nevada, Reno, with Jim Gibbons. With no other serious candidates for the office, Titus received 64,006 votes, Gibson 42,973.[http://www.secretaryofstate.biz/nvelection/2006StateWidePrimary/ElectionSummary.htm] She lost the general election to [[Jim Gibbons (United States politician)|Jim Gibbons]] by a margin of 47% to 44%, due in large part to the strong popularity of Gibbons in rural and western Nevada.

Titus is married to Thomas Clayton Wright, a UNLV history professor. Some of her personal interests are [[travel]] and [[tap dance]].
