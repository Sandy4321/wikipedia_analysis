The '''Taiping Heavenly Kingdom''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{linktext|<U+592A>|<U+5E73>|<U+5929>|<U+56EF>}},<small><sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup></small> [[pinyin]]: ''T<U+00E0>ip<U+00ED>ng Ti<U+0101>ngu<U+00F3>''; [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]]: ''Thai-ph<U+00EC>n Thi<U+00EA>n-koet'', lit. "Great Peaceful Kingdom of Heaven" or "Heavenly Kingdom") was an oppositional state in China from 1851 to 1864, established by [[Hong Xiuquan|H<U+00F3>ng Xi<U+00F9>qu<U+00E1>n (<U+6D2A><U+79C0><U+5168>)]], the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850&ndash;1864).<U+00A0> Its capital was at Tianjing (<U+5929><U+4EAC>, [[Wade-Giles]]: ''Tienching'', "Heavenly Capital"), present-day [[Nanjing]].

A convert to [[Christianity]], Hong Xiuquan led an army that controlled much of southern China, with about 30 million people.<U+00A0> The rebel Kingdom announced social reforms and the replacement of [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Chinese folk religion]] by a form of Christianity, holding that Hong Xiuquan was the younger brother of [[Jesus]].<U+00A0> The Taiping areas were besieged by Qing forces throughout most of the rebellion.<U+00A0> The Qing government defeated the rebellion with the eventual aid of [[Second French Empire|French]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces.<U+00A0> The conflict was one of the deadliest wars in history, with about 25 million killed, mainly civilians.

==History of the Taiping Rebellion==
{{main|Taiping Rebellion}}
[[Image:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Hong Xiuquan]]

===Origins of the Rebellion===
In the mid-19th century, China under the [[Qing Dynasty|Q<U+012B>ng Dynasty (<U+5927><U+6E05>)]] suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems, and defeats at the hands of the [[Western powers]], in particular, the humiliating defeat in 1842 by the United Kingdom in the [[First Opium War]].<U+00A0> The ethnically [[Manchu]] Qing were seen by much of the Chinese population (the majority of which was ethnically [[Chinese Han|Han]]) as ineffective and corrupt foreign rulers.<U+00A0> Anti-Manchu sentiment was strongest in the south among the laboring classes, and it was these disaffected who flocked to join the charismatic visionary [[Hong Xiuquan|H<U+00F3>ng Xi<U+00F9>qu<U+00E1>n (<U+6D2A><U+79C0><U+5168>)]].

After Hong failed to pass the [[Imperial examination|examinations]] that would make him one of the elite, he studied the [[Bible]] with the help of a [[Protestant]] missionary.<U+00A0> One day he claimed to have had a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] to the effect that he was the younger brother of [[Jesus]].<U+00A0> After his vision, he felt it was his duty to spread [[Christianity]] and overthrow the foreign rule of the Qing.<U+00A0> Hong's associate [[Yang Xiuqing|Y<U+00E1>ng Xi<U+00F9>q<U+012B>ng (<U+694A><U+79C0><U+6E05>)]] was a former firewood salesman of [[Guangxi|Gu<U+0103>ngx<U+012B> (<U+5EE3><U+897F>)]], who claimed to be able to act as a voice of [[God]] to direct the people and gain political power.

[[Feng Yunshan|F<U+0113>ng Y<U+00FA>nsh<U+0101>n (<U+99AE><U+96F2><U+5C71>)]] formed the Society of God Worshippers ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{linktext|<U+62DC>|<U+4E0A><U+5E1D>|<U+4F1A>}}, [[Pinyin]]: ''B<U+00E0>i Sh<U+00E0>ng<U+200B>d<U+00EC> Hu<U+00EC>''), in [[Guangxi|Gu<U+0103>ngx<U+012B> (<U+5EE3><U+897F>) province]] after a missionary journey there in 1844 to spread Hong's ideas.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204254/Feng-Yunshan</ref><U+00A0> In 1847 Hong become the leader of the secret society.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580815/Taiping-Rebellion</ref><U+00A0> The sect's power grew in the late 1840s, initially suppressing groups of [[bandit]]s and [[pirate]]s, but persecution by Qing authorities spurred the movement into a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla rebellion]] and then into [[civil war]].

====Hong's religion====
According to an assessment in the ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'', Hong's Christian ideology was largely concerned with the suppression of vices, as formulated in the [[Old Testament]], and ignored "[[New Testament]] ideas of humility and kindness", as well as "the Christian ideas of [[original sin]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]."<ref name="EB-Hong-Xiuquan">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276586/Hong-Xiuquan</ref>

{{cquote|In 1847 Hong went to [[Guangzhou]] to study Christianity with the Rev. I. J. Roberts, an American missionary.<U+00A0> The two months he spent with Roberts marked his sole formal training in the doctrines of Christianity.<U+00A0> Hong's contacts with Western Christianity did, however, teach him that there were other countries in the world.<U+00A0> Rather than the traditional Chinese ethnocentrism, he postulated a world of many nations, all of them equal under God.<U+00A0> Moreover, he was iconoclastic in his attitude toward the Chinese culture of his day, labeling it the work of evil demons and insisting that all symbols of it be destroyed.}}

===Establishment of the Kingdom===
The [[Taiping Rebellion]] began in 1851 in [[Guangxi]] Province.<U+00A0> After minor clashes, the violence escalated into the [[Jintian Uprising]] in February 1851, in which a ten thousand-strong rebel army routed and defeated a smaller Qing force.<U+00A0> On February 11, 1851 (the 11th day of the 1st lunar month), incidentally Hong Xiuquan's birthday, Hong declared himself "Heavenly King" ([[image:Ten.png|15px]]<U+738B>, ''Tianwang'') of a new dynasty, the "Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace".<ref name="EB-Hong-Xiuquan"/><ref name="Fairbank2006">''[http://books.google.com/books?id=nBDC2cqb6I0C&pg=RA2-PA206 China: a new history]'', John King Fairbank and Merle Goldman.<U+00A0> Harvard, 2006.</ref>

====Capital at Tianjing (Nanjing)====
[[Image:TaiPingRevolutionSeal.png|thumb|right|200px|Royal seal of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]]
In 1853 the Taiping forces captured [[Nanjing]], making it their capital and renaming it ''[[Tianjing]]'', "Heavenly Capital".<U+00A0> Hong built his [[Presidential Palace (Nanjing)|Palace of Heavenly King]] there by converting the Office of the [[Viceroy of Liangjiang]].

At its height, the Heavenly Kingdom encompassed much of south and central China, centered on the fertile [[Yangtze]] river valley.<U+00A0> Control of the river meant that the Taipings could easily supply their capital.<U+00A0> From there, the Taipings sent armies west into the upper reaches of the Yangtze, and north to capture the Imperial capital of [[Beijing]].<U+00A0> The attempt to take Beijing failed.

===Internal conflict===
In 1853 Hong withdrew from active control of policies and administration, ruling exclusively by written proclamations often in religious language.<U+00A0> Hong disagreed with Yang in certain matters of policy and became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions, his extensive network of spies, and his declarations when "speaking as God".<U+00A0> Yang and his family were put to death by Hong's followers in 1856, followed by the killing of troops loyal to Yang.<ref>Spence 1996, p. 243</ref>

With their leader largely out of the picture, Taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the Chinese middle classes and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts.<U+00A0> The Europeans decided to stay neutral.<U+00A0> Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of their hostility to Chinese customs and [[Confucian]] values.<U+00A0> The land-owning upper class, unsettled by the Taipings' peasant mannerisms and their policy of strict separation of the sexes, even for married couples, sided with the Imperial forces and their Western allies.

In 1859 [[Hong Rengan]], a cousin of Hong, joined the Taiping in Nanjing, and was given considerable power by Hong.<U+00A0> He developed an ambitious plan to expand the Kingdom's boundaries.<U+00A0> In 1860 the Taiping were successful in taking [[Hangzhou]] and [[Suzhou]] to the east (See also: [[Second rout of the Army Group Jiangnan]]), but failed to take [[Battle of Shanghai (1861)|Shanghai]], which marked the beginning of the decline of the Kingdom.

===The fall of the Kingdom===
[[Image:Naval battle between Taiping-Qing on Yangtze.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Naval battle between Taiping-Qing on Yangtze river near Nanjing]]
[[Image:Taiping2.PNG|thumb|right|350px|Greatest extent of the Taiping Rebellion.]]
An attempt to [[Battle of Shanghai (1861)|take Shanghai]] in August 1860 was initially successful but finally repulsed by a force of Chinese troops and European officers under the command of [[Frederick Townsend Ward]].<ref name=son>Spence (1996)</ref><U+00A0> This army would later become the "[[Ever Victorious Army]]", led by [[Charles George Gordon|"Chinese" Gordon]], and would be instrumental in the defeat of the Taiping rebels.<U+00A0> Imperial forces were reorganized under the command of [[Zeng Guofan]] and [[Li Hongzhang]], and the Imperial reconquest began in earnest.<U+00A0> By early 1864 Imperial control in most areas was well established.

Hong declared that God would defend Nanjing, but in June 1864, with Imperial forces approaching, he died of [[food poisoning]] as the result of eating wild vegetables as the city began to run out of food.<U+00A0> He was sick for twenty days before the Imperial forces could take the city.<U+00A0> Only a few days after his death the Imperial forces took the city.<U+00A0> His body was buried in the former [[Ming Palace, Nanjing|Ming Imperial Palace]] where it was later exhumed by the conquering Zeng to verify his death, and cremated.<U+00A0> Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising.

Four months before the fall of the Heavenly Kingdom of Taiping, Hong Xiuquan abdicated in favour of [[Hong Tianguifu]], his eldest son, fifteen years old.<U+00A0> Hong Tianguifu was unable to do anything to restore the Kingdom, so the Kingdom was quickly destroyed when Nanjing fell in July 1864 to the Imperial armies after vicious street-by-street fighting.<U+00A0> Most of the princes were executed by Qing Imperials in Jinling Town ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+91D1><U+9675><U+57CE>}}), Nanjing.

Although the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the destruction of the Taiping regime, the fight was not yet over.<U+00A0> There were still several hundred thousand Taiping rebel troops continuing the fight, with more than a quarter million fighting in the border regions of [[Jiangxi]] and [[Fujian]].<U+00A0> It would take seven years to finally put down all remnants of the Taiping Rebellion.<U+00A0> In August 1871 the last Taiping rebel army, led by [[Shi Dakai]]'s commander, General [[Li Fuzhong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+674E><U+798F><U+5FE0>}}), was completely wiped out by the Imperial forces in the border region of [[Hunan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Guangxi]].

==The Heavenly Kingdom's policies==
Within the land that it controlled, the Taiping Heavenly Army established a [[theocracy|theocratic]] and [[military dictatorship|highly militarized rule]].

* The subject of study for the [[examination]]s for officials (formerly [[civil service exam]]s) changed from the [[Confucianism|Confucian classics]] to the [[Bible]].
* [[Private property]] ownership was abolished and all land was held and distributed by the state.
* A [[solar calendar]] replaced the [[lunar calendar]].
* [[Foot binding]] was banned.<U+00A0> (The [[Hakka people]] had never followed this tradition, and consequently the Hakka women had always been able to work the fields.<ref>Spence 1996, p. 25</ref>)
* The society was declared [[social class|class]]less and the sexes were declared equal.<U+00A0> It was the first Chinese regime ever to admit women to examinations.
* The sexes were rigorously separated; there were separate army units consisting of women only; until 1855, not even married couples were allowed to live together or have sexual relations.<ref>Spence 1996, p. 234</ref>
* The Qing-dictated [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]] was abandoned in favor of wearing the hair long.
* Other new laws were promulgated including the prohibition of [[opium]], [[gambling]], [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], [[polygamy]] (including [[concubinage]]), [[slavery]], and [[prostitution]].<U+00A0> These all carried draconian penalties.

===Theology===
The movement's founder, Hong Xiuquan, had tried and failed to earn his ''shengyuan'' civil service degree numerous times.<U+00A0> After one such failure in 1836, Hong overheard a Chinese Protestant missionary ([[Liang Fa]]) preaching and took home some Chinese translations of Bible tracts which had been translated by [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]], including a pamphlet titled "Good Words for Exhorting the Age" by [[Liang Fa]].<U+00A0> "Hong and his cousin were both baptized in accordance with Liang's directions.<ref>The Taiping rebellion History and Documents Volume 1 p. 25</ref><U+00A0> The missionary was probably Edwin Stevens of [[New England]], who operated illegally in China.<ref>Spence 1996, p. 31</ref><U+00A0> In 1843, after Hong's final failure at the exams, he had what some regard as a nervous breakdown and others as a mystical revelation, connecting his in-depth readings of the Christian tracts to strange dreams he had been having for the past six years.<U+00A0> In his dreams, a bearded man with golden hair and a black robe called himself [[Jehovah]], gave him a sword, and taught him to slay demons beside a younger man whom Hong addressed as "Elder Brother".<ref>Spence 1999, p. 172</ref>

Hong Xiuquan came to believe that the figures in his dreams were God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son and that they were revealing his destiny as a slayer of demons and the leader of a new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth.<ref name="WSU">Wsu.edu. "[http://www.wsu.edu:8001/~dee/CHING/TAIPING.HTM Wsu.edu]." ''Taiping Rebellion.'' Retrieved on 11 April 2007.</ref><U+00A0> The demons were later interpreted by him to be the Qing and false religions.

Hong developed a literalist understanding of the Bible and added a third [[testament]] of annotations to the Taiping's [[Bible]].<U+00A0> These developed a [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness theology]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} He rejected the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], saying "God is the Father and embodies myriads of phenomena; Christ is the Son, who was manifest in the body... The Wind of the Holy Spirit, God, is also a Son... God is one who gives shapes to things, molds things into forms, who created heaven and created earth, who begins and ends all things, yet has no beginning or end himself..." and "God and the Savior are one."<ref>''The Taiping Rebellion History and Documents'', Volume 1 p. 138</ref>

Hong's deputy [[Yang Xiuqing]] later took the title "Comforting Holy Wind", as he was keen to gain titles.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Yang Xiuqing's religious motivations are disputed.

===Currency===
In its first year, the Heavenly Kingdom minted coins that were 23&nbsp;mm to 26&nbsp;mm in diameter, weighing around 4.1&nbsp;[[gram|g]].<U+00A0> The kingdom's name was inscribed on the obverse and "Holy Treasure" ({{zh|{{linktext|<U+8056>|<U+5BF6>}}}}) on the reverse.

===Administration===

[[Image:Heavenly king's throne.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The Heavenly king's throne in Nanjing]]
Ranked below the "King of Heaven" Hong Xiuquan, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] was divided among provincial rulers called [[monarch|king]]s or [[prince]]s, initially there were five{{spaced ndash}}the Kings of the Four Quarters and the King of the ''Yi'' ("flanks"{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}).<U+00A0> Of the original rulers, the West King and South King were killed in combat in 1852.<U+00A0> The East King was murdered by the North King during a ''coup d'<U+00E9>tat'' in 1856, and the North King himself was subsequently killed.<U+00A0> The kings' names were:

* South King ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5357><U+738B>}}), [[Feng Yunshan]] (d. 1852)
* East King ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6771><U+738B>}}), [[Yang Xiuqing]] (d. 1856)
* West King ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+897F><U+738B>}}), [[Xiao Chaogui]] (d. 1852)
* North King ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5317><U+738B>}}), [[Wei Changhui]] (d. 1856)
* Yi King ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+7FFC><U+738B>}}), [[Shi Dakai]] (captured and executed by Qing Imperials in 1863)

The later leaders of the movement were 'Princes':
* Zhong Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5FE0><U+738B>}}), [[Li Xiucheng]] (1823{{spaced ndash}}1864, captured and executed by Qing Imperials)
* Ying Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+82F1><U+738B>}}), [[Chen Yucheng]] (1837{{spaced ndash}}1862)
* Gan Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5E72><U+738B>}}), [[Hong Rengan]] (1822{{spaced ndash}}1864; cousin of Hong Xiuquan, executed)
* Jun Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+9075><U+738B>}}), [[Lai Wenkwok]] (1827{{spaced ndash}}1868)
* Fu Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+798F><U+738B>}}), Hong Renda ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6D2A><U+4EC1><U+9054>}}; Hong Xiuquan's second-eldest brother; executed by Qing Imperials in 1864)
* Tian Gui (Tien Kuei) ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+7530><U+8CB4>}}; executed in 1864)

Other princes include:
* An Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+5B89><U+738B>}}), Hong Renfa ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6D2A><U+4EC1><U+767C>}}), Hong Xiuquan's eldest brother
* Yong Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+52C7><U+738B>}}), Hong Rengui ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6D2A><U+4EC1><U+8CB4>}})
* Fu Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+798F><U+738B>}}), Hong Renfu ({{lang|zh-Hant|<U+6D2A><U+4EC1><U+5BCC>}})

In the later years of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] was divided among many, for a time into the thousands, of provincial rulers called [[prince]]s, depending on the whims of Hong.

== Notes ==
:<small><sup>1</sup></small>Note that the uncommon [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] {{linktext|<U+56EF>}} is used, as opposed to the more common {{linktext|<U+570B>}} (and later, {{linktext|<U+56FD>}}).<U+00A0> The Taiping used ''wang'' ({{linktext|<U+738B>}}, "king") in the center of their character, as opposed to the traditional Chinese ''huo'' ({{linktext|<U+6216>}}, "or", used as a phonetic marker) or the later simplified Chinese ''yu'' ({{linktext|<U+7389>}}, "jade").

:Note also that [[image:Ten.png|15px]] uses an uncommon variant with a longer upper stroke than the normal <U+5929>.<U+00A0> This is similar to the Japanese ''ten'' <U+5929>, but Unicode does not offer support as separate character, instead only displaying the Japanese version when Chinese functionality is disabled.
