'''M-553''' is a north-south [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. The trunkline was originally [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]] Road 553. It is the main highway connection between the [[U.S. Route 41 in Michigan|US 41]]/[[M-28 (Michigan highway)|M-28]] corridor and both the [[Sawyer International Airport]] and [[Gwinn, Michigan|Gwinn]].

M-553 was given its number based on the county road it replaced. It was designated in 1998 and extended through the City of Marquette in 2005. The highway is related to [[M-554 (Michigan highway)|M-554]] which was decommissioned and turned over to the city in the state route swap that extended M-553.

==Route description==
M-553 begins as a two-lane rural highway east of Gwinn in the [[New Swanzy, Michigan|New Swanzy]] neighborhood. From there it runs north through the Sands Plains, past the access road to the west gate of the former [[K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base]]. M-553 reaches CR 480 at the "Crossroads" area of Marquette County just north of the Sands Plains. There it passes into hilly, wooded terrain. It descends a steep curve alongside the Marquette Mountain Ski Area before crossing the [[Carp River (Michigan)|Carp River]].<ref name="google">{{Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=County+Road+553+%26+M-35,+Gwinn,+Marquette,+Michigan+49841,+United+States&daddr=CR-553%2FM-335+%4046.316330,+-87.417500+to:CR-553+%26+Johnson+Drive,+Gwinn,+Michigan+to:CR-553+%26+CR-480,+Sands,+Michigan+to:US-41+%26+McClellan+Ave,+Marquette,+MI+49855&hl=en&geocode=%3B2461088769564456457,46.316330,-87.417500%3B%3B%3B&mra=ls&sll=46.37005,-87.416225&sspn=0.301326,0.458679&ie=UTF8&ll=46.409931,-87.41684&spn=0.301107,0.458679&z=11 |accessdate=2008-08-26}}</ref>

On the south side of the [[Marquette, Michigan|City of Marquette]], M-553 takes McClellan Ave, a four-lane boulevard divided by a center turn lane. The northern terminus of M-553 is a signalized intersection along the [[Marquette Bypass]] portion of US 41/M-28, a four-lane divided [[expressway]] that bypasses downtown Marquette.  The intersection is designed as a "[[Michigan Left]]". Traffic wishing to make a left turn at the intersection must instead use a median cross-over lane to complete the turn.<ref name="google"/>

==History==
As part of [[John Engler|Governor Engler's]] Rationalization plan, County Road 553 was transferred to state jurisdiction on [[September 24]], [[1998]].<ref name="mpr"/><ref name="MDOT99">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |title=Official 1999 Department of Transportation Map |year=1999 |cartography= MDOT |section= C6 }}</ref> The [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] designated the highway M-553 based on the former county designation. A portion of CR 553 was numbered [[M-554 (Michigan highway)|M-554]] but not signed. The highway designation stopped at the intersection with M-554 and McClellan Ave in the City of [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] until 2005.<ref name="MDOT06">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |title=Official 2006 Department of Transportation Map |year=2006 |cartography= MDOT |section= C6 }}</ref>

In 2005, the City of Marquette agreed to a "route swap" with MDOT. This swap placed former [[U.S. Route 41 Business (Marquette, Michigan)|BUS US 41]] and M-554 under city jurisdiction in exchange for the extension of M-553 to its current northern terminus at the [[Marquette Bypass (Michigan)|Marquette Bypass]]. M-553 was extended northward along McClellan Ave.<ref name="jtpr">{{cite press release |title= MDOT and city of Marquette complete jurisdictional transfer |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |date=[[November 9]], [[2005]] |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11057-129975--,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref> MDOT has initiated a speed study to determine what speed limits should apply on the extension.
