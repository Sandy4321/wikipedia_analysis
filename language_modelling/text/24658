'''''The Sweet Escape''''' is the second solo [[album]] by [[United States|America]]n [[pop rock]] singer [[Gwen Stefani]], released by [[Interscope Records]] in December 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]).  Having originally intended to return to [[No Doubt]] after her 2004 solo album ''[[Love. Angel. Music. Baby.]]'', Stefani decided to record a second album as a way to release some of the material left over from ''L.A.M.B.'' writing sessions. The album musically resembles its predecessor while exploring more [[pop rap]] sounds. It was released to generally negative reviews from contemporary music critics, receiving criticism for its strong similarities to ''L.A.M.B.''

It was preceded by the lead single "[[Wind It Up (Gwen Stefani song)|Wind It Up]]", which charted moderately across the world, and produced the follow-up single "[[The Sweet Escape (song)|The Sweet Escape]]", which proved more successful worldwide.  ''The Sweet Escape'' has reached the Canadian, U.S, & Australian top five and has peaked inside the top twenty in the UK. [[The Sweet Escape Tour]], started in April 2007, will cover North America, Central America, Australia, Asia and Europe.

==Background==
Following the release of her debut album ''Love. Angel. Music.

==Album cover==
[[Image:GrandOldPartyJillGreenberg.jpg|left|thumb|''Grand Old Party'', one of the images from Greenberg's ''End Times'' series which served as the inspiration for the cover art.]]

The [[album cover]] was taken by photographer [[Jill Greenberg]].  The image was part of a series of promotional images taken by Greenberg, inspired by her previous ''End Times'' exhibition.  To create ''End Times'', Greenberg gave [[lollipop]]s to [[toddler]]s but took them back after several moments, provoking emotional outbursts.  Greenberg used the images as a representation of [[American politics]] and [[culture of the United States|society]].<ref>Glaister, Dan.  [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1830213,00.html "Critics call foul over LA exhibition"].  ''[[The Guardian]]''.  [[July 26]], [[2006]].  Retrieved [[May 13]], [[2007]].</ref>  Greenberg was accused of [[child abuse]] for the photo shoots; Stefani, however, commented, "I didn't think 'child abuse' -- I just thought, 'That's beautiful.'  Every kid cries.  Other people reacted like, 'Oh my God.  That's so disturbing,' or 'That's so sad.'  I guess that's what art's all about. It's supposed to make you think."<ref>Doherty, Mike.  [http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/artslife/story.html?id=d5ff3ef3-a858-4588-9d48-f6607e660c1a&k=2319&cid=1111636538&ei=nkN2RbrmI4e6pwKivdyFCQ "The thrills are alive: Gwen Stefani's new disc"].  ''[[National Post]]''.  [[December 5]], [[2006]].  Retrieved [[May 13]], [[2007]].</ref>

Stefani's appearance on the album cover is inspired that of by Elvira Hancock, a [[drugs and prostitution|coke whore]] portrayed by [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the 1983 film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.  Stefani first gained inspiration for the style when making the music video for "[[Cool (song)|Cool]]".  During the shoot, Stefani saw her [[No Doubt]] bandmate Tony Kanal and his girlfriend, who had on a "long, peach, polyester [late-1970s style] dress". It was this dress that got Stefani thinking "about Michelle Pfeiffer and how amazingly styled she was [in ''Scarface'']", which in turn drew inspiration for the cover.<ref>Collins, Clark.  [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1562569,00.html "Holla Back"].  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.  [[November 22]], [[2006]].  Retrieved [[May 23]], [[2007]].</ref> The pair of oversized [[sunglasses]] on the album cover is intended to represent her "guarded exterior", and the other images symbolize her various emotions.<ref>Stefani, Gwen.  [http://www.gwenstefani.com/faq/default.aspx "FAQs"].  [[Universal Music Group]].  Retrieved [[May 13]], [[2007]].</ref> Gwen Stefani quotes herself on her FAQ page, "My initial inspiration for the artwork was seeing [[Jill Greenberg]]<U+2019>s End Times exhibit. I fell in love with the beautifully lit, emotional images. The photos looked hyper real and perfectly perfect even though the emotions were slightly disturbing. The shots with sunglasses on the cover represent our guarded exterior while the interior shots show the real emotions we all have inside. "

==Critical response==  
''The Sweet Escape'' received mostly negative responses from critics.<ref>Wener, Ben.

The album received criticism for its similarities to ''Love. Angel. Music. Baby.''  Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' noted that "history will likely view ''The Sweet Escape'' as a retread of Stefani's well-received solo debut, but it shares that album's general inconsistency and, thus, its peaks and valleys".<ref>Sal Cinquemani, [http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=1025 ''The Sweet Escape'' review], ''Slant Magazine''.</ref>  In his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Rob Sheffield agreed, viewing it as "her hasty return" to music lacking the energy of ''L.A.M.B.'' and in which "she sounds exhausted."<ref>Sheffield, Rob.
