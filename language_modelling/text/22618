'''Theism''', in the broadest sense, is the belief that at least one [[deity]] exists.<ref>

In a more specific sense, ''theism'' is commonly a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] doctrine concerning the nature of a [[deity]], and that deity's relationship to the [[universe]].<ref>Perspectives of reality: an introduction to the philosophy of Hinduism - Page 20, Jeaneane D. Fowler - 2002</ref><ref>''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, Second Edition'', [[OUP]]</ref><ref>''The [[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' (1997).</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]''.</ref> ''Theism'', in this specific sense, [[personal god|conceives of God as personal]], [[immanence|present]] and active in the governance and organization of the world and the universe. As such ''theism'' describes the classical conception of God that is found in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism and  Hinduism. The use of the word ''theism'' to indicate this classical form of [[monotheism]] began during the [[scientific revolution]] of the seventeenth century in order to distinguish it from the then-emerging [[deism]] which contended that God, though transcendent and supreme, did not intervene in the [[natural world]] and could be known rationally but not via [[revelation]].<ref>John Orr (''English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits'', 1934) explains that before the seventeenth century theism and deism were interchangeable terms but during the course of the seventeenth century they gained separate and mutually exclusive meanings (see [[deism]])

The term ''theism'' derives from the Greek ''theos'' meaning "god". The term ''theism'' was first used by [[Ralph Cudworth]] (1617<U+2013>88).<ref>

</ref> In Cudworth's definition, they are "strictly and properly called Theists, who affirm, that a perfectly conscious understanding being, or mind, existing of itself from eternity, was the cause of all other things".<ref>Cudworth, Ralph (1678).

[[Atheism]] is rejection of theism in the broadest sense of theism; i.e. the rejection of belief that there is even one deity.<ref>

Instead of saying that an atheist is someone who believes that it is false or probably false that there is a God, a more adequate characterization of atheism consists in the more complex claim that to be an atheist is to be someone who rejects belief in God for the following reasons (which reason is stressed depends on how God is being conceived)...}}

People frequently adopt an attitude of rejection toward a position for reasons other than that it is a false proposition. It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless. Sometimes, too, a theory is rejected on such grounds as that it is sterile or redundant or capricious, and there are many other considerations which in certain contexts are generally agreed to constitute good grounds for rejecting an assertion.}}(page 175 in 1967 edition)

Rejection of the narrower sense of theism can take forms such as [[deism]], [[pantheism]], and [[polytheism]]. The claim that the existence of any deity is unknown or unknowable is [[agnosticism]].<ref name=Hepburn>

 | quote=In the popular sense, an agnostic is someone who neither believes nor disbelieves in God, whereas an atheist disbelieves in God. In the strict sense, however, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist. In so far as one holds that our beliefs are rational only if they are sufficiently supported by human reason, the person who accepts the philosophical position of agnosticism will hold that neither the belief that God exists nor the belief that God does not exist is rational.}}

The positive assertion of knowledge, either of the existence of gods or the absence of gods, can also be attributed to some theists and some atheists.
Put simply theism and atheism deal with belief, and agnosticism deals with (absence of) rational claims to asserting [[knowledge]].<ref name=RoweRoutledge />

==Types==
===Monotheism===
{{Main|Monotheism}}
Monotheism (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:<U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>|<U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2>]]}}) is the belief in [[theology]] that only one [[deity]] exists.<ref><U+201C>Monotheism<U+201D>, in Britannica, 15th ed. (1986), 8:266.
</ref>
Some modern day [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religions include [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Baha'i Faith]], [[Sikhism]], [[Eckankar]] and some forms of [[Hinduism]].

===Polytheism===
{{Main|Polytheism}}
Polytheism is the belief that there is more than one deity.<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/polytheism AskOxford: polytheism<!-- Bot generated title -->]
</ref>
In practice, polytheism is not just the belief that there are multiple gods; it usually includes belief in the existence of a specific [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of distinct deities.

Within polytheism there are ''hard'' and ''soft'' varieties:
* [[Hard polytheism]] views the gods as being distinct and separate beings; an example of this would be the [[Ancient Egyptian Religion|Egyptian]] and [[Greek Mythology|Greek]] [[Mythology|Religions]]; along with certain schools of [[Hinduism]].
* [[Soft polytheism]] views the gods as being subsumed into a greater whole. Some forms of [[Hinduism]] such as [[Smartism]]/[[Advaita Vedanta]] serve as examples of soft polytheism.

Polytheism is also divided according to how the individual deities are regarded:
*[[Henotheism]]: The viewpoint/belief that there may be more than one deity, but only one of them is worshipped.
*[[Kathenotheism]]: The viewpoint/belief that there is more than one deity, but only one deity is worshipped at a time or ever, and another may be worthy of worship at another time or place.  If they are worshipped one at a time, then each is supreme in turn.
*[[Monolatrism]]: The belief that there may be more than one deity, but that only one is worthy of being worshipped. Most of the modern [[monotheistic]] religions may have begun as monolatric ones, although this is disputed.

===Pantheism and panentheism===
{{Main|Pantheism|Panentheism}}
*[[Pantheism]]: The belief that the physical universe is equivalent to a god or gods, and that there is no division between a Creator and the substance of its creation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/p.htm#pant |title=Philosophical Dictionary: Pacifism-Particular}}
</ref> Examples include many forms of [[Saivism]].
*[[Panentheism]]: Like Pantheism, the belief that the physical universe is joined to a god or gods. However, it also believes that a god or gods are greater than the material universe. Examples include most forms of [[Vaishnavism]].

Some people find the distinction between these two beliefs as ambiguous and unhelpful, while others see it as a significant point of division.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/religion/blrel_theism_panen.htm |title=What is Panentheism? |publisher=About.Com: Agnosticism/Atheism |accessdate=2011-03-18}}
</ref>

===Deism===
{{Main|Deism}}
*Deism is the belief that at least one deity exists and created the world, but that the creator(s) does/do not alter the original plan for the universe.<ref>[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/deism AskOxford: deism<!-- Bot generated title -->]
</ref>
Deism typically rejects supernatural events (such as prophecies, miracles, and divine revelations) prominent in organized religion. Instead, Deism holds that religious beliefs must be founded on human reason and observed features of the natural world, and that these sources reveal the existence of a supreme being as creator.<ref>Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language (G. & C. Merriam, 1924) defines deism as "belief in the existence of a personal god, with disbelief in Christian teaching, or with a purely rationalistic interpretation of Scripture".
</ref>
:*[[Pandeism]]: The belief that a god preceded the universe and created it, but is now equivalent with it.
:*[[Panendeism]] combines deism with panentheism, believing the universe is a part (but not the whole) of deity
:*[[Polydeism]]: The belief that multiple gods existed, but do not intervene with the universe.

===Autotheism===
{{Main|Apotheosis}}
Autotheism is the viewpoint that, whether divinity is also external or not, it is inherently within 'oneself' and that one has a duty to become perfect (or divine). This can be in a selfless way, a way following the implications of statements attributed to ethical, philosophical, and religious leaders (such as [[Jesus]]<ref>Matthew 5:38 "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect"
</ref><ref>
Luke 17:21 "The Kingdom of God is within you"
</ref>
and [[Mahavira]]{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}).

Autotheism can also refer to the belief that one's self is a deity (often the only one), within the context of [[subjectivism]]. This is a fairly extreme version of subjectivism, however.

===Value-judgment theisms===
*[[Eutheism]] is the belief that a deity is wholly benevolent.
*[[Dystheism]] is the belief that a deity is not wholly good, and is possibly evil.
*[[Maltheism]] is the belief that a deity exists, but is wholly malicious.
