'''Emily Warren Roebling''' (September 23, 1843 <U+2013> February 28, 1903) was married to Washington Roebling, a [[civil engineer]] who was Chief Engineer during the construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. She is best known for her contribution to the completion of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] after her husband developed [[decompression sickness|caisson disease]].<ref name="Weingardt, Richard page 56">Weingardt, Richard: "Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers", page 56. ASCE Publications, 2005.</ref>

==Childhood==
Emily was born to Sylvanus and Phebe Warren at [[Cold Spring, New York]] on September 23, 1843. She was the second youngest of twelve children.<ref>Roebling, Emily Warren: "Notes on the Warren Family" in the Appendix, Page 446, "The Journal of the Reverend Silas Comfort", Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1903</ref> Emily<U+2019>s interest in pursuing education was supported by her older brother [[Gouverneur K. Warren]].  The two siblings always held a close relationship.<ref name="Weingardt, Richard page 56"/>

==The Roeblings==
In 1864, during the [[American Civil War]], Emily visited her brother, then commanding the Fifth Army Corps, at his headquarters.  During the visit, she became acquainted with [[Washington Roebling]], the son of Brooklyn Bridge designer [[John A. Roebling]], who was a civil engineer serving on Gouverneur Warren's staff.<ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 80">Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 80. Globe Pequot, 2001.</ref> Emily and Washington immediately fell in love and on January 18, 1865, the two were married.<ref name="Logan, Mary page 297">Logan, Mary: "The Part Taken by Women in American History", page 297. The Perry-Nalle Publishing Co., 1912.</ref>

As John Roebling was starting his work on the Brooklyn Bridge, the newlyweds went to Europe to study the use of [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] for the bridge.<ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 80"/>  In November 1867, Emily gave birth to the couple's only child, John A. Roebling II 
.<ref name="Logan, Mary page 297"/>

==The Brooklyn Bridge==
On their return from their European studies, Emily and Washington were greeted with a turn of fate; Washington's father died of [[tetanus]], and Washington immediately took charge of the Brooklyn Bridge's construction.<ref>Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 82. Globe Pequot, 2001.</ref>    As he immersed himself in the project, Washington developed [[decompression sickness|caisson disease]],<ref>Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 83. Globe Pequot, 2001.</ref><ref name=dcs>{{cite journal |author=Butler WP |title=Caisson disease during the construction of the Eads and Brooklyn Bridges: A review |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=445<U+2013>59 |year=2004 |pmid=15686275 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4028 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref>  which affected him so badly that he became bed-ridden.  It was at this point that Emily stepped in as the <U+201C>first woman field engineer<U+201D> and saw out the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge.<ref name="Logan, Mary page 297"/>

As the only person to visit her husband during his sickness, Emily was to relay information from Washington to his assistants and report the progress of work on the bridge.  She developed an extensive knowledge of [[strength of materials]], [[stress analysis]], [[wire rope|cable construction]], and calculating [[catenary]] curves through Washington's teachings.<ref>Weingardt, Richard: "Engineering Legends: Great American Civil Engineers", page 58. ASCE Publications, 2005.</ref>  Emily's knowledge was complemented by her prior interest in and study of the bridge's construction upon her husband's appointment to Chief Engineer.  For the next fourteen years, Emily's dedication to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge was unyielding. She took over much of the chief engineer's duties, including day-to-day supervision and project management.  Emily and her husband jointly planned the bridge's continued construction.  She dealt with politicians, competing engineers, and all those associated with the work on the bridge to the point where people believed she was behind the bridge's design.<ref name="Logan, Mary page 297"/>  

In 1882, Washington's title of chief engineer was in jeopardy due to his sickness.  In order to allow him to retain his title, Emily went to gatherings of engineers and politicians to defend her husband.  To the Roeblings' relief, the politicians responded well to Emily's speeches and Washington was permitted to remain Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge.

With Washington still Chief Engineer, the Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed in 1883.  In advance of the official opening, carrying a rooster as a sign of victory, Emily Roebling was the first to cross the bridge by carriage.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[David McCullough]] |title=Brave Companions. Portraits in History| publisher=Simon & Schuster, 1992 |page=116 |isbn=0-671-79276-8}}</ref>  At the opening ceremony, Emily was honored in a speech by [[Abram Stevens Hewitt]] who said at the bridge was
{{quote|...an everlasting monument to the sacrificing devotion of a woman and of her capacity for that higher education from which she has been too long disbarred.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASCE History and Heritage of Civil Engineering: Emily Roebling |url= http://www.asce.org/history/bio_roebling_e.html |publisher=asce.org}}</ref>}}

Today the Brooklyn Bridge holds a plaque dedicated to the memory of Emily, her husband, and her father-in-law.<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=68007 Historical Marker Database] Photo of Emily Warren Roebling plaque</ref><ref>Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 89. Globe Pequot, 2001.</ref>

==After the Bridge==
After the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Roebling family moved to [[Trenton, New Jersey]].  There, Emily participated in social organizations such as the [[Relief Society]] during the [[Spanish-American War]] and served on the Board of Lady Managers for New Jersey at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].<ref>Logan, Mary: "The Part Taken by Women in American History", page 298. The Perry-Nalle Publishing Co., 1912.</ref>  She also continued her education and received a law degree from [[New York University]].<ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 88">Petrash, Antonia: "More than Petticoats:  Remarkable New York Women", page 88. Globe Pequot, 2001.</ref>  Until Emily's death on February 28, 1903, she spent her remaining time with her family and kept socially and mentally active.<ref name="Petrash, Antonia page 88"/>
