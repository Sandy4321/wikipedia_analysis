The name ''Delhi'' is often also used to include urban areas near the NCT, as well as to refer to [[New Delhi]], the capital of India, which lies within the metropolis. Although technically a federally administered [[union territory]], the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a [[States of India|state]] of India with its own [[legislature]], [[high court]] and an executive council of ministers headed by a [[Chief Minister of Delhi|Chief Minister]]. [[New Delhi]], jointly administered by both the federal [[Government of India]] and the local [[Government of Delhi]], is also the capital of the NCT of Delhi.
