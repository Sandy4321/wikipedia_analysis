'''Royal Tunbridge Wells''' (or '''Tunbridge Wells''') is a town in west [[Kent]], [[England]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[London]], though its boundaries lie across the border of [[East Sussex]]. It is on the northern edge of the [[Weald]]. 

The town came into being as a [[spa]] in [[Georgian era|Georgian]] times and had its heyday in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when the [[Pantiles]] and its [[chalybeate]] spring attracted visitors who wished to take the waters. Though its popularity waned with the advent of sea bathing, the town remains popular and derives some 30% of its income from the tourist industry.<ref name="TWBC Economic Overview"> {{cite web|url=http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/10/Report_03.pdf |title=Economic Overview of Tunbridge Wells Borough |accessdate=2008-08-22 |date=2004-10 |format=PDF |publisher=Tunbridge Wells Borough Council |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060927100850/http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/upload/public/attachments/10/Report_03.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-09 }}</ref>

The area which is now Tunbridge Wells was part of the parish of [[Speldhurst]] for hundreds of years, but the origin of the town as it is today, however, came in the seventeenth century. In 1606 [[Dudley North, 3rd Baron North|Dudley, Lord North]], a courtier to [[James I of England|James I]] who was staying at a hunting lodge in [[Eridge]] in the hope that the country air might improve his ailing constitution, discovered a [[chalybeate]] spring. He drank from the spring and, when his health improved, he became convinced that it had healing properties<ref name="Burr">{{cite book | last = Burr | first = Thomas Benge | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The History of Tunbridge Wells | publisher = | date = 1766 | location = London | pages = | url = http://theweald.org/bk.asp?bookid=burr000 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>.

By 1636 it had became so popular that two houses were built next to the spring to cater for the visitors, one for the ladies and one for the gentlemen<ref name="Burr"/>, and in 1664 Lord Muskerry, Lord of the Manor, enclosed it with a triangular stone wall, and built a hall "to shelter the dippers in wet weather."<ref name='Horsfield'>{{cite book | last = Horsfield | first = Thomas Walker | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The History, Antiquities and Topography of the County of Sussex | publisher = Sussex Press | date = 1835 | location = Lewes, Sussex | pages = | url = http://theweald.org/bk.asp?BookId=Hfield421 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>

[[Image:Church of king charles the martyr.JPG|thumb|left|The church of King Charles the Martyr]]
Until 1676 little permanent building took place - visitors were obliged either to camp on the [[North Downs|downs]] or to find lodgings at [[Southborough]],<ref name="Wilson"/> - but at this time houses and shops were erected on the walks, and every "convenient situation near the springs" was built upon<ref name="Burr"/>. Also in 1676 a subscription for a "[[chapel]] of ease" was opened, and in 1684 the church of [[King Charles the Martyr]] was duly built<ref name="Burr"/> and the town began to develop around it. In 1787 [[Edward Hasted]] described the new town as consisting of four small districts, "named after the hills on which they stand, Mount Ephraim, Mount Pleasant and Mount Sion; the other is called the Wells..."<ref name="Hasted">{{cite book | last = Hasted | first = Edward | authorlink = Edward Hasted | coauthors = | title = The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 3 | publisher = W.

The 1680s saw a building boom in the town: carefully planned shops were built beside the {{convert|175|yd|m}} long [[Pantiles]] promenade (then known as the Walks), and the Mount Sion road, on which lodging house keepers were to build, was laid out in small plots.

[[Image:Mountpleasantroad14.jpg|thumb|Mount Pleasant and the railway station]] 
By the early nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells experienced growth as a place for the well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]],<ref name="Wilson"/> and benefited from a new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827,<ref name="Wilson"/> and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as [[gas lighting]] and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100.<ref name="Directory of Kent, Surrey & Sussex"/> In 1842 an [[bus|omnibus]] service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours,<ref name="Given"/> and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway's]] London-Hastings [[Hastings Line]] at Tonbridge. During this time [[Decimus Burton]] developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.<ref name='HMAG'> {{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/burton/dbother.aspx |title=Decimus Burton <U+2013> Work Outside London |accessdate=2008-08-27 |date=2008 |publisher=Hastings Borough Council |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070702144659/http://www.hmag.org.uk/burton/dbother.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-02 }}</ref> 

In 1889 the town was awarded the status of a Borough, and it entered the 20th century in a prosperous state. 1902 saw the opening of an Opera House, and in 1909 the town received its "Royal" prefix. Due to its position in South East England, during the [[First World War]] Tunbridge Wells was made a headquarters for the army, and its hospitals were used to treat soldiers who had been sent home with a [[Blighty|"blighty wound"]]; the town also received 150 Belgian refugees. The [[Second World War]] affected Tunbridge Wells in a different way - it became so swollen with refugees from London that accommodation was severely strained. Over 3,800 buildings were damaged by bombing, but only 15 people lost their lives.<ref name="Given"/>

===Toponymy===

Edward Hasted made the assertion in 1797 that although the wells were originally named the "Queen's-Wells", they soon took on the name of Tunbridge Wells due to their proximity to the town of [[Tonbridge]] (then known as "Tunbridge"):

{{Cquote|In compliment to [queen Henrietta Maria's] doctor, Lewis Rowzee, in his treatise on them, calls these springs the Queen's-wells; but this name lasted but a small time, and they were soon afterwards universally known by that of Tunbridge-wells, which names they acquired from the company usually residing at Tunbridge town, when they came into these parts for the benefit of drinking the waters.|200|50|Edward Hasted<ref name="Hasted"/>}}
 
The prefix "Royal" dates to 1909, when [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] granted the town its official "Royal" title to celebrate its popularity over the years amongst members of the [[royal family]]<ref name='Royal prefix'> {{cite web|url=http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/section.asp?catid=796&docid=1834 |title=Local Coronation Souvenir donated to Tunbridge Wells Museum and Art Gallery |accessdate=2008-08-22 |date=2007-10-02 |publisher=Tunbridge Wells Borough Council |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308233941/http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/section.asp?catid=796&docid=1834 |archivedate=2007-03-08 }}</ref>. Royal Tunbridge Wells is one of only two towns in England to have been granted this (the other being [[Royal Leamington Spa]]).

==Governance==
[[Image:KentTunbridgeWells.svg|thumb|left|The borough of Tunbridge Wells as shown within Kent]]

Tunbridge Wells is the administrative centre for both [[Tunbridge Wells (borough)|Tunbridge Wells Borough]] and the parliamentary constituency of [[Tunbridge Wells (UK Parliament constituency)|Tunbridge Wells]]. 

The Borough is governed by 48 [[Councillor]]s, representing 20 [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] (eight wards fall within the town of Tunbridge Wells itself). Elections are held for 16 Council seats each year on a rotational basis, meaning that each Councillor faces election every three years. The exception to this is a County Council election, held once every four years, in which all seats are contested.<ref name="Council Democracy"> {{cite web|url=http://www2.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=5 |title=Council Democracy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |date=2008 |publisher=Tunbridge Wells Borough Council }}</ref>

[[Tunbridge Wells local elections]] show a pattern since 1973 of Conservative party dominance, apart from a two year period from 1994 to 1996 of [[no overall control]] and a two year period from 1996 to 1998 when the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] held a majority. The most recent elections, held in May 2008, gave the Conservatives a large majority with 44 seats compared with the Liberal Democrats' four.<ref name="Council Democracy"/>

The constituency has been Conservative since its inception in 1974 for the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974 General Election]]. The two previous MPs were [[Patrick Mayhew|Sir Patrick Mayhew]] (1974-1997) and the former [[Asda]] chairman [[Archie Norman]] (1997-2005).

==Geography==
[[Image:Royal Tunbridge Wellsmap 1946.jpg|thumb|right|A map of the town in 1946]]
Tunbridge Wells is located at {{coor dms|51|13|32|N|0|15|52|E|city}} on the Kentish border with [[East Sussex]], about {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of London; the original centre of the settlement lies directly on the Kent/East Sussex border,<ref name='Tunbridglographia'> {{cite journal|title=Tunbridglographia - Being Some Literary Reminiscences of Tunbridge Wells|journal=The Sussex County Magazine|date=1939|first=John|last=Playford|coauthors=|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=2008-08-27 }}</ref> as recalled by the county boundary flagstone that still lies outside the church of King Charles the Martyr.

The town is situated at the northern edge of the High Weald, a ridge of hard [[sandstone]] that runs across southern England from [[Hampshire]] along the borders of [[Surrey]], [[West Sussex]], East Sussex and Kent (the town's geology is illustrated by the exposed sandstone outcrops at the Wellington Rocks and High Rocks, and the nearby village of [[Langton Green]] had a number of stone [[Quarry|quarries]] from which sandstone was taken well into the 20th century to build houses in Tunbridge Wells<ref name='Langton'> {{cite web|url=http://www.langtongreen.org.uk/history.html |title=A History of Langton Green |accessdate=2008-08-26 |last=Hynes |first=Leonora |date=2005 |publisher=LangtonGreen.org.uk |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060805111315/http://langtongreen.org.uk/history.html |archivedate=2006-08-05 }}</ref>), and the town is sited at the head of valley that runs south-east to [[Groombridge]]; the stream in the valley is one of the many tributaries of the [[River Medway]], which runs through a much larger valley north of the High Weald. 

[[Image:KentGeologyWealdenDomeSimple.svg|thumb|The geology of Tunbridge Wells as part of the Weald]]
Nearby villages have been subsumed into the built-up area of the town, so that now it incorporates [[High Brooms]] to the north, [[Hawkenbury]] to the south, and [[Rusthall]] (whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks) to the west.

===Twinning===

Tunbridge Wells is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:
* {{flagicon|Germany}}[[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]]
In 1960, through an advertisement in the national press, contact was made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship that now exists between the two towns sprang up, leading to the signing in 1989 of the official Twinning Charter. Also through this the ''Tunbridge Wells Twinning and Friendship Association'' (TWTFA) was formed.<ref name='TWTFA'> {{cite web|url=http://www.townforum.org.uk/members/twtfa/twtfa.html |title=Tunbridge Wells Twinning & Friendship Association (TWTFA) |accessdate=2008-08-22 |last=Holman |first=Michael |publisher=TWTFA }}</ref>

==Landmarks==
The Pantiles and its chalybeate spring have been the landmarks most readily associated with Tunbridge Wells ever since the founding of the town, though the {{convert|5|m|ft}} high steel [[Millennium]] Clock at the Fiveways area in the centre of town, designed by local sculptor Jon Mills for the Millennium celebrations, stakes a claim to be a modern landmark.<ref name='Millennium Clock'> {{cite web|url=http://www.visittunbridgewells.com/pages/PhotoGallery.asp?LevelID=105&page=2&RecordsPerPage=8 |title=VisitTunbridgeWells.com Picture Gallery |accessdate=2008-08-26 |publisher=VisitTunbridgeWells.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071027161057/http://www.visittunbridgewells.com/pages/PhotoGallery.asp?LevelID=105&page=2&RecordsPerPage=8 |archivedate=2007-10-27 }}</ref><ref name='Millennium Clock2'> {{cite web|url=http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/section.asp?catid=159 |title=Arts Development |accessdate=2008-08-26 |date=2007-01-29 |publisher=Tunbridge Wells Borough Council |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071108170739/http://www.tunbridgewells.gov.uk/section.asp?catid=159 |archivedate=2007-11-08 }}</ref>

Tunbridge Wells town historically had three railway stations: two of these are still in use by [[National Rail]] services. [[Tunbridge Wells railway station|Tunbridge Wells station]] is, as its former name of Tunbridge Wells Central suggests, centrally located within the town at the end of the High Street, whilst [[High Brooms railway station|High Brooms station]] is situated in High Brooms, to the north of the town. Both stations are located on the double-tracked [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]] [[Hastings Line]]; services are operated by the [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] [[train operating company]].

[[Dunorlan Park]], at {{convert|78|acre|sqmi km2}} the largest maintained green space in the town, was once a private garden that was part of the millionaire [[Henry Reed (merchant)|Henry Reed's]] now demolished mansion, and only passed into public possession in 1941<ref name='Dunorlan'> {{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmenvtra/477/477mem24.htm |title= Memorandum by the Friends of Dunorlan Park, Tunbridge Wells (TCP 20) |accessdate=2008-08-26 |date=1999-04 |work=House of Commons Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Memoranda |publisher=UK Parliament |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060508060549/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmenvtra/477/477mem24.htm |archivedate=2006-05-08 }}</ref>.
