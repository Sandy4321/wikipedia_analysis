'''State Route&nbsp;401''' (SR&nbsp;401) is a {{convert|12.13|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] in [[Pacific County, Washington|Pacific County]] within the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington]]. The highway originates at the north end of the [[Astoria <U+2013> Megler Bridge]] west of [[Megler, Washington|Megler]] at an intersection with {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 101 in Washington|U.S. Route 101]]}} (US&nbsp;101). The roadway travels northeast, paralleling cliffs, the [[Columbia River]] and the South Fork of the [[Naselle River]] to [[Naselle, Washington|Naselle]], ending at {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 4|SR 4]]}}. The road was designated '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;12B''' (SSH&nbsp;12) between 1937 and 1964, when SR&nbsp;401 was created to replace SSH&nbsp;12B. The Astoria <U+2013> Megler Bridge, completed in 1966, replaced a ferry east of the bridge, where the highway originally ended. The roadway was extended west to the north end of the bridge, where it currently terminates. The former ferry terminal became a [[rest area]] that was closed during the winter until 2007, when construction was completed to provide access year-round.

Secondary State Highway&nbsp;12B (SSH&nbsp;12B) was created during the 1937 establishment of the [[Primary State Highways (Washington)|Primary and secondary state highway system]] as an [[auxiliary route]] of {{nowrap|[[Primary State Highway 12 (Washington)|Primary State Highway 12]]}} (PSH&nbsp;12), co-signed as both {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 101 in Washington|U.S. Route 101]]}} (US&nbsp;101) and {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 830|US 830]]}}.
