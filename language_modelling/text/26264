In [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], '''Hayagriva''' is a wrathful manifestation of [[Avalokiteshvara]], with 108 forms.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/product/TC06 Five-Headed Sixteen-Armed Hayagriva with Goddess Marici] - exoticindiaart.com</ref> His special ability is to cure diseases, especially skin diseases even as serious as leprosy, which is said to be caused by the [[N<U+0101>ga]]s (water spirits with serpent bodies).

In [[Hinduism]], one tradition identifies [[Hayagriva]] as a group of demons subdued by [[Vishnu]], according to another tradition, Hayagriva was incarnation of Vishnu.
 
In Tibet, Hayagriva was promoted especially by Buddhist teacher [[Atisha]].<ref name="Kreijger2001">{{cite book|author=Hugo Kreijger|title=Tibetan Painting: The Jucker Collection|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LaHtKkiEBYIC&pg=PA106|accessdate=23 June 2012|year=2001|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|isbn=978-0-906026-56-4|pages=106<U+2013>}}</ref> It is said that Tibetan horse-dealers worshipped Hayagriva because he could frighten away demons by neighing like a horse. When invoked he announces his coming by neighing, the sound of which pierces false appearances and disguise.

==Buddhist iconography==

In his simplest form Hayagriva is depicted with one face, two arms and two legs. Everything about him is wrathful - a scowling face with three glaring eyes, a roaring mouth with protruding fangs, a pose of warrior<U+2019>s aggressiveness, a broad belly bulging with inner energy, a sword raised threateningly in his right hand (poised to cut through delusion), his left hand raised in a threatening gesture and snake ornaments. This terrifying aspect expresses compassion<U+2019>s fierce determination to help us overcome inner egotism and outer obstructions.
