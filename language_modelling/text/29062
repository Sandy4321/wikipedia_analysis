'''Amar'e Carsares Stoudemire'''<ref name="NBA.com interview 2008" /> (born November 16, 1982 in [[Lake Wales, Florida]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Phoenix Suns]]. He is a {{convert|6|ft|10|in|cm|adj=on}} and {{convert|249|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]/[[center (basketball)|center]].

Stoudemire won the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award]] in [[2002<U+2013>03 NBA season|2003]], made four appearances in the [[NBA All-Star Game]], made first-team [[All-NBA Team]] in [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2007]], and won Bronze Medal with the [[United States men's national basketball team]] at the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]].

Stoudemire's first name had previously been listed in the Phoenix Suns media guide as "Amar<U+00E9>" or "Amare", but it was changed to "Amar'e" in October 2008.<ref>{{cite news

==Early life and career==
Stoudemire's father died when he was twelve, and his mother Carrie was in and out of [[prison]] during that time also. As a result, he attended six different high schools before graduating from [[Cypress Creek High School (Orlando, Florida)|Cypress Creek High School]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. He told Isaac Perry in an article for ''Dime Magazine'' that what kept him going in that time period was [[God]] and the words of rapper [[Tupac Shakur]].

He did not start playing organized basketball until he was fourteen.<ref name="bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/amare_stoudemire/bio.html |title=Amare Stoudemire Info Page <U+2013> Bio |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Stoudemire only played two years of high school-level basketball, but in those two years he was named the MVP of the Nike summer league. He committed to play at the [[University of Memphis]], but never attended the school.

Instead, he declared for the NBA draft because of his desire to quickly help his family. The Phoenix Suns decided on him with their ninth pick in the [[2002 NBA Draft]] due to a need for inside strength at the time. Phoenix was the only team that year to select a high school player in the first round.

==NBA career==
In his rookie season, Stoudemire averaged 13.5 points and 8.8 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game, with a season high of 38 points, against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] on December 30, 2002, the highest score by a prep-to-pro player until broken a year later by [[LeBron James]].{{Fact|date=July 2008}} Stoudemire won the [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA's Rookie of the Year award]], beating out [[Houston Rockets]] center [[Yao Ming]] and [[Miami Heat]] forward [[Caron Butler]] and becoming the first player drafted out of high school to win the award.

The following season, Stoudemire improved statistically,<ref>[http://82games.com/02PHO10A.HTM Amare Stoudemire 2002-2003 stats]</ref><ref>[http://82games.com/03PHO13A.HTM Amare Stoudemire 2003-2004 stats]</ref> but his team stumbled to a 29<U+2013>53 record, and [[point guard]] [[Stephon Marbury]] was traded to the [[New York Knicks]]. During the summer of 2004, Stoudemire was selected to play for the United States national team in the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. However, head coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] declined to give him significant playing time{{Quantify|date=July 2008}}.

During the [[2004<U+2013>05 NBA season]], Stoudemire teamed up with point guard [[Steve Nash]] to lead the Suns to a 62<U+2013>20 record. Averaging 26 points per game that year and achieving a new career high of 50 points against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] on January 2, 2005, he was selected to his first [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game]] as a reserve forward. In the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, Stoudemire performed magnificently, averaging 37 points per game, but the Suns lost in 5 games.

===Knee problems===
[[Image:Amare Stoudamire CIMG2460b.jpg|thumb|Amar'e Stoudemire training]]
During the 2005<U+2013>2006 NBA pre-season, knee cartilage damage was discovered and Stoudemire underwent [[microfracture surgery]] on October 18, 2005. Initially, the Suns thought he would return by mid-February,<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nba&id=2187523 Stoudemire undergoes microfracture surgery, out for four months], Associated Press, October 18, 2005</ref> but his rehab took longer than expected. Stoudemire, however, made an attempt to return but did not play well, going scoreless against the [[New Jersey Nets]] on March 27, 2006. On March 28 it was announced that he would likely miss the rest of the regular season due to ongoing stiffness in both knees. His manager stated that the comeback happened a little too soon, and Stoudemire needed to do more rehab.<ref>[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0330amare0330.html Amar<U+00E9> back in Valley], Paul Coro, ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'', March 30, 2006</ref>  Stoudemire's rehabilitation, which was led by Suns trainer Aaron Nelson<ref>[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/51333 Amare Rehab Team], East Valley Tribune, October 23, 2005</ref> and Dr. Micheal Clark, the president and CEO of the [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]] (NASM)<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/ian_thomsen/09/14/stoudemire.oden/index.html Admiring Amare], SI.com, September 14, 2007</ref> went well as he stated during the rehab that he was pretty explosive and he gradually gained his strength back.

Stoudemire attended the 2006 [[USA Basketball]] camp in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], although he ultimately did not play in the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]]. His [[athletic trainer]]s stated that he had no swelling since his most recent surgery and his strength and flexibility have been "better than ever: almost like superman".{{Who|date=April 2008}}

Stoudemire played in the [[FIBA Americas Championship 2007]], but withdrew from the [[United States men's national basketball team|national team]] for the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]]. [[Jerry Colangelo]], managing director for the national team, said, "Amar'e has pulled himself out of consideration for the roster and that's predicated on, despite the fact that he's had an injury-free year coming back, he's a little hesitant on pushing the envelope too hard." Stoudemire had said in April 2008, "It's more than a year-round grind. It's last year and the year before that and the year before that. It's really been like a three-year-round basketball circuit."<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/suns/2008-06-19-stoudemire-usa_N.htm Citing injury concern, Stoudemire turns down Team USA], Paul Coro, USAToday.com, June 19, 2008</ref>

===2006<U+2013>07 season===
Before the [[2006<U+2013>07 NBA season|2006<U+2013>07 season]], Stoudemire changed his jersey number from 32 to 1.<ref name="jerseychange">[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2459075 Amare to change jersey number from No. 32 to No. 1]. Updated May 26, 2006</ref> [[Dijon Thompson]], last wore #1 the previous season.<ref name="jerseychange" /><ref>http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/sports/articles/0527sunsnotes0527.html</ref>

Stoudemire joined the United States national team once and began practicing with the international team in July, but was dropped from the squad for its trip to Asia because coach [[Mike Krzyzewski]] believed he needed a proper chance to fully recover from his knee injuries.

On [[February 18]], [[2007]], Stoudemire appeared in the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game]], his second [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearance. He scored 29 points and grabbed 9 rebounds, and came in second in MVP voting to winner [[Kobe Bryant]].{{Fact|date=April 2008}} He had previously announced that he would make the All Star Game in his first season back after his knee recovered.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

During the [[2007 NBA Playoffs]], in a series against the [[San Antonio Spurs]], Stoudemire accused [[Manu Gin<U+00F3>bili]] and [[Bruce Bowen]] of being "dirty" players.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/nba/070510/v051021A.html |title=Suns Amare Stoudemire calls Bowen, Ginobili 'dirty' players |date=2007-05-10 |publisher=cbc.ca |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ap-suns-spurs&prov=ap&type=lgns |title=Spurs to try to close out replenished Suns |date=2007-05-17 |publisher=Yahoo! sports |accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> Stoudemire was suspended for Game 5 for leaving the bench area after an altercation between guard Steve Nash and [[Robert Horry]]. The Suns lost to the Spurs in six games.

===2007<U+2013>2008===
Stoudemire led the Suns in scoring 25.8 and rebounds 9.1 in the 2007<U+2013>2008 season.  He made the 2008 NBA All-Star team and was named to the 2nd team on the [[All-NBA Team]]. Stoudemire also adjusted well to playing with [[Shaquille O'Neal]], who the Suns had acquired in February.  The Suns however faltered in the playoffs, again losing to their nemesis the [[San Antonio Spurs]]. The Suns blew a big lead in game one of the series, and seemed to never recover, losing the series 4<U+2013>1 to the Spurs. Stoudemire averaged 23 points in the series.  After the season,  the Suns coach Mike D'Antoni left the team to coach the [[New York Knicks]].

===2008<U+2013>2009===
With new coach [[Terry Porter]], the Suns game turned more to an emphasis on defense and a more controlled offense.  The Suns offensive slowdown affected Stoudemire, whose scoring average dropped about 4 points from the previous season, although he was still the leading the team in scoring and rebounding.  The Suns also struggled with Terry Porter's system, and were just 28<U+2013>23 and had lost their last five games just before the 2009 NBA All-Star game.  Stoudemire started for the winning Western Conference in the [[2009 NBA All-Star Game]].

Looking to cut costs, and perhaps continue to break up the team (the Suns had  traded [[Raja Bell]] and [[Boris Diaw]] in December)  Stoudemire was expected to be traded before the NBA trading deadline on February 19, but a deal never materialized.   On February 16, the Suns fired Terry Porter, and hired [[Alvin Gentry]], who said he was committed to get the Suns back to their fast paced offense, a style which is best suited for Stoudemire's game.

On [[February 19]], in a game against the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], Stoudemire suffered a [[detached retina]], although he may have injured it earlier as he had been bothered by the same eye even before this game.  He had injured the same eye in preseason, although this injury involved a partially torn [[iris]], with no damage to his retina. He said then that he would have to wear protective goggles for the rest of his career, but stopped wearing them after seven games.<ref>{{cite news

==Off the court==
In November 2008, Stoudemire received the NBA's Community Assist Award, for his work with his Each 1, Teach 1 Foundation, and its efforts to provide safe drinking water in [[Sierra Leone]] by funding the building of water wells in impoverished villages. Stoudemire visited the country in Summer 2008, making visits to water well sites and meeting with President [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] and the rest of the cabinet.<ref>{{cite news
