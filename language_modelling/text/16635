'''State Route 3''' is a {{convert|148.81|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] in the [[Northern California|northern]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It runs from [[California State Route 36|SR-36]] north along the shore of [[Trinity Lake]], [[Fort Jones, California|Fort Jones]] and [[Etna, California|Etna]]. The route approaches [[Yreka, California|Yreka]], intersecting with [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]], and turns east to [[Montague, California|Montague]]. The road was numbered SR 3 in 1964, and most of it has been part of the state highway system since 1933.

==Route description==
State Route 3 begins at the junction with [[State Route 36 (California)|State Route 36]] south of the town of [[Peanut, California|Peanut]] in [[Trinity County, California|Trinity County]]. SR-3 is also known as Bramlot Road from its southern terminus to [[Hayfork, California|Hayfork]]. This stretch of road through the [[Shasta-Trinity National Forest]] parallels the [[Hayfork River]]. Once SR-3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes through the mountains to [[Douglas City, California|Douglas City]] and the junction with [[State Route 299 (California)|State Route 299]]. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of [[Weaverville, California|Weaverville]].<ref name="rmcn">{{Cite map | publisher=Rand McNally | title=The Road Atlas | year=2008 | page=12 | section=NB3-NE4 }}</ref><ref name="tg">{{Cite map | publisher=Thomas Brothers | title=California Road Atlas and Driver's Guide | year=2000 | page=3,4,11,12,17}}</ref>

SR 3 then departs from SR 299, providing access to the [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area]] and [[Trinity Dam]] along [[Lewiston Lake]]. SR 3 passes through the towns of [[Covington Mill, California|Covington Mill]], [[Trinity Center, California|Trinity Center]], and [[Wyntoon, California|Wyntoon]] before paralleling the [[Trinity River]] as Weaverville-Scott Mountain Road <ref name="rmcn" /><ref name="tg" />and crossing the [[Scott Mountains]] and the [[Pacific Crest Trail]] at {{convert|5205|ft|m}} into [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou County]].<ref name="cah">{{cite web |url=http://www.cahighways.org/001-008.html|title=California Highways (www.cahighways.org): Routes 1 through 8 |accessdate=2007-12-08 |author=Daniel P. Faigin.}}</ref>

In Siskiyou County, SR 3 passes through [[Callahan, California|Callahan]], [[Etna, California|Etna]], [[Greenview, California|Greenview]], and [[Fort Jones, California|Fort Jones]] as it turns northeast to intersect with [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] in [[Yreka, California|Yreka]]. At this point, [[State Route 263 (California)|State Route 263]] continues in the northerly direction towards [[State Route 96 (California)|State Route 96]]; SR 3 turns east to its northern terminus in the incorporated city of [[Montague, California|Montague]].<ref name="rmcn" /><ref name="tg" />

==History==
The short piece from [[California State Route 36|SR 36]] north to [[Peanut, California|Peanut]] was added to the state highway system in 1907 as part of the [[Peanut Road]],<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1907|ch=117|p=139}}</ref> which became [[Legislative Route 35 (California pre-1964)|Route 35]] in 1917.<ref>Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 ([http://www.archive.org/details/californiahighwa00blowrich Archive.org] or [http://books.google.com/books?id=osgNAAAAYAAJ Google Books]), p. 112</ref> Route 35 was extended north from Peanut to [[Legislative Route 20 (California pre-1964)|Route 20]] ([[California State Route 299|SR 299]]) near [[Douglas City, California|Douglas City]] in 1933, and simultaneously a new '''Route 82''' was created, running from [[Legislative Route 3 (California pre-1964)|Route 3]] ([[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]]) in the [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] area southwest to [[Etna, California|Etna]] and east to [[Montague, California|Montague]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2034}}: "Etna Mills to Montague." "State Highway Route 35 near Peanut to State Highway Route 20 near Douglas City."</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=277, 281}}: "Route 35 is from Route 1 near Alton to Route 20 near Douglas City, passing near Kuntz and Peanut." "Route 82 is from Etna Mills to Montague."</ref> The gap between Douglas City and Etna was filled in 1959 with an extension of Route 82 south to Route 20 near [[Weaverville, California|Weaverville]]; at the same time, the portion between Weaverville and Yreka was added to the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], which identifies the main routes of transportation in the state of California.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1062|p=3113, 3116}}</ref> The '''State Route 3''' designation was applied to the Peanut-Montague roadway in the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1171}}</ref> The [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with temporary [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] (along the portion where SR 3 runs [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with Interstate 5 today) near Yreka was removed when the new I-5 bypass was built; the legislative definition was updated to reflect this in 1974, soon after the building of the bypass.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1974|ch=123|p=247}}: "Route 3 is from: ...(b) Route 299 near Weaverville to Montague via Main Street in Yreka."</ref>
