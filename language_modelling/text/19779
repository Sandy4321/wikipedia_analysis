The '''aftermath of the [[2011 T<U+014D>hoku earthquake and tsunami]]''' included both a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 300,000 refugees in the T<U+014D>hoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine and fuel for survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces, whilst many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $490 million in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at <U+00A5>10 trillion ($122 billion).

==Humanitarian crisis==

The earthquake caused a large number of displaced people. The number of the evacuees has once passed 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0321/TKY201103210097.html |title=asahi.com<U+FF08><U+671D><U+65E5><U+65B0><U+805E><U+793E><U+FF09><U+FF1A><U+907F><U+96E3><U+8005><U+3001><U+FF11><U+FF16><U+90FD><U+770C><U+3067><U+FF13><U+FF11><U+4E07><U+FF19><U+FF11><U+FF12><U+FF11><U+4EBA><U+2015><U+FF12><U+FF11><U+65E5><U+5348><U+5F8C><U+FF11><U+FF11><U+6642> <U+2013> <U+793E><U+4F1A> |publisher=Asahi.com |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}</ref> Some earthquake survivors died in the shelters or in the process of evacuation.

Some economic analysts consider that, ultimately, the catastrophe will improve Japan's economy, with increased job availability during restoration efforts. An analyst at [[JPMorgan Chase]], citing the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and the Southern California [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], noted that natural disasters "do eventually boost output." An analyst at [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale]] anticipated that Japan's economy will decline in March but will revive powerfully in subsequent months. After the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]], industrial output dropped 2.6%, but increased by 2.2% the next month, and 1% the following month.
