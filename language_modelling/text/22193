'''Andr<U+00E9> Rossignol''' was a [[France|French]] [[auto racing|racing driver]] who became the first driver to win the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] twice, winning in consecutive years. Rossignol was a driver for the French [[Lorraine-Dietrich]] [[automobile]] company, and had been on their driving team since the inaugural Le Mans in {{24hLM|1923}}. After having finished eighth and third the first two years, Rossignol and teammate [[G<U+00E9>rard de Courcelles]] won the event overall in {{24hLM|1925}}. The following year, [[Robert Bloch (racing driver)|Robert Bloch]] was assigned to drive with Rossignol, and the race was won once again, with all three Lorraine-Dietrichs finishing on the podium.

After Lorraine-Dietrich chose not to enter cars in the {{24hLM|1927}} event, Rossignol was hired by [[Chrysler]] and partnered with Henri Stoffel. The two finished the race in third place. Rossignol did not participate at Le Mans again.
