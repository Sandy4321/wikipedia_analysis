'''M-114''' was the designation of a former [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] and planned beltline in the US state of [[Michigan]] around the city of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. It was designated by the end of 1929 on various streets in adjoining cities and townships. By the 1940s, sections of it on the west and south sides of Grand Rapids were given new designations and the segment along the east side of town was finished. By late 1945 the highway designation was completely [[decommissioned highway|decommissioned]] in favor of other numbers. M-114 split into two branches, one running east<U+2013>west and the other running north<U+2013>south. The east<U+2013>west spur routing is now local streets while the rest is part of state highways.

==History==
The first segments of M-114 were completed by January 1, 1930 and ran along the west side of Grand Rapids, on what is now [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|Wilson Avenue]] between [[M-45 (Michigan highway)|Lake Michigan Drive]] and Leonard Street. At the same time, what would become a spur was also finished from the town of [[Cascade, Michigan|Cascade]] to US&nbsp;131 (Division Avenue).<ref name="MSHD30-01">{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=January 1, 1930 |cartography= H.M. Gousha |inset= Grand Rapids }}</ref> By July 1 that same year, the southern segment was extended west to Clyde Park Avenue in [[Wyoming Township, Michigan|Wyoming Township]].<ref name="MSHD30-07">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=July 1, 1930 |cartography= H.M. Gousha |inset= Grand Rapids }}</ref> By the end of 1936 M-114 was a three-legged trunkline around the Grand Rapids area. It started at US&nbsp;16 in [[Walker, Michigan|Walker Township]] and ran south to [[Grandville, Michigan|Grandville]] where it turned to run eastward to the community of Cascade. The third leg was shown on maps as under construction from a junction in [[Paris Township, Kent County, Michigan|Paris Township]] north to a junction with US&nbsp;16 in [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|East Grand Rapids]]; the trunkline continued north from US&nbsp;16 to a junction with US&nbsp;131 in [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield Township]] north of Grand Rapids.<ref name="MSHD36-12">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1936/7 Official Michigan Highway Map |year=December 15, 1936 |edition=Winter |cartography= Rand McNally |section= K8<U+2013>L9}}</ref>

By June 15, 1942 the highways in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A [[U.S. Route 16 Bypass (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|Bypass US&nbsp;16]] (BYP US&nbsp;16) designation was assigned to the portion of M-114 that traveled around the southwest side of Grand Rapids (now [[M-11 (Michigan highway)|M-11]]), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along the east side of the city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time.<ref name="MSHD42-06">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1942 Official Michigan Highway Map |year=June 1, 1942 |edition=Summer |cartography=Rand McNally |inset= Grand Rapids}}</ref> By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. The eastern leg was assigned a [[U.S. Route 131 Bypass (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|BYP US&nbsp;131]] designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A [[M-21 Bypass (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|BYP M-21]] designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs.<ref name="MSHD45-10">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map of Michigan |year=October 1, 1945 |section=K8<U+2013>L9}}</ref> East Beltline now carries [[M-37 (Michigan highway)|M-37]] and [[M-44 (Michigan highway)|M-44]].<ref name="MDOT12">{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2012 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:3.5&nbsp;mi&nbsp;/ 1&nbsp;cm:2&nbsp;km |inset= Grand Rapids }}</ref>

==Route description==
As it existed before the designation was removed, M-114 started at the corner of [[U.S. Route 16 Bypass (Grand Rapids, Michigan)|BYP US&nbsp;16]] (28th Street) and what is now East Beltline Avenue in [[Paris Township, Kent County, Michigan|Paris Township]] (now Kentwood) and ran northward. The trunkline intersected the mainline for [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|US&nbsp;16]]/[[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]] at Cascade Road and the mainline for [[M-21 (Michigan highway)|M-21]] at Fulton Street near [[East Grand Rapids, Michigan|East Grand Rapids]] in [[Grand Rapids Township, Michigan|Grand Rapids Township]]. Further north, the highway split into two. In [[Plainfield Township, Kent County, Michigan|Plainfield Township]], a leg of M-114 continued west along the modern 3&nbsp;Mile Road through an intersection with US&nbsp;131 to terminate at Coit Avenue near the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and the other leg continued north to a terminus with US&nbsp;131 at Northland Drive and Plainfield Avenue.<ref name="MSHD42-06"/>
