'''Violet Beauregarde''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Roald Dahl]] novel ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and its film adaptations, ''[[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. She is a [[chewing gum]] fanatic, having broken a world record by chewing the same piece and type of gum for three months solid. In the original novel and 1971 film, Violet has a [[best friend]] named Cornelia Prinzmetel, whose record she broke. In the 2005 film, she appears to not have any friends, because of her overcompetitiveness. 

==Differences==

In all three versions of the story, Violet tries an experimental piece of "three-course-meal" gum, against [[Willy Wonka]]'s advice about the prototype's bugs. This causes her to turn blue, fill with juice and swell up like a balloon, essentially making her into a human-sized [[blueberry]] (considerably larger in the 2005 film), much to the horror of her parents. The [[Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory|1971 version]] adds a twist to Violet's downfall - if the blueberry juice inside her was not squeezed out of her immediately, she would [[explode]]. 

Although the three versions of Violet vary, they share similar personality traits. She is far more of a [[tomboy]] than [[Veruca Salt]], seems the most pleasant of the naughty children, and is somewhat more competitive than the other Golden Ticket Winners, especially in the 2005 movie, where her competitive behavior is greatly expanded to include her even participating in sports and the martial arts. Also, in all three versions of the story, Violet addresses her mom as "Mother" <U+2014>- despite cultural changes over time.

As part of the four misbehaving children, Violet corresponds to one of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. She has the least obvious connection of the four, but she appears to represent [[pride]]. Because of the vague connection to her sin, Violet, especially the 1971 [[Denise Nickerson]] version of the character, has come to be regarded by many fans and [[fan fiction]] writers as the most sympathetic of the four "naughty" children (particularly because in the 1971 version she's the only one to tell Veruca to "Can it, you nit!"). {{cn}}

In Roald Dahl's novel ''[[Charlie And The Chocolate Factory]]'' Violet is described as having a "great big mop of curly hair" and as someone who talks "very fast and very loudly". Illustrations of her vary from illustrator to illustrator, but she is usually drawn as having a large mouth and wearing [[blue]] [[jeans]] and a [[purple]] [[T-shirt]], reflecting her tomboyish nature. In this version, both her parents accompany her to the factory. Her nationalty is not mentioned but both film versions make her American.

One aspect of Violet found in the novel but not taken up in either film version was her habit - shared with other children - of inconveniencing other people for her own amusement. She boasts about how she liked to stick a piece of gum on lift/elevator buttons so that whoever presses the button next will have gum stuck on their finger. "You get the best results with women who have expensive gloves on". Incidently, in this version her mother disapproves of her gum-chewing habit.

===Violet in 1971 film===

|gender=Female
|personality=Similar to book, but with some minor differences; she and [[Veruca Salt|Veruca]] don't get along, but she is very nice to Charlie. Not as competitive as other adaptations, but still a loud and fast talker. She also loves her dad but is very eager to get into the spotlight.

|}}

In the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|1971 movie adaption]], Violet was portrayed as a pre-teen girl with long brown hair and wearing a dark blue pant-dress, living in [[Miles City, Montana]]. She was played by twelve-year-old former ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' child actress [[Denise Nickerson]]. Her father, <span id=Sam Beauregarde>[[Sam Beauregarde]]</span> (played by [[Leonard Stone]]), was a [[sales]]man of used American [[automobile]]s who never missed an opportunity to compete with other car dealers and sell his cars on the lot. However, he does in fact care about his daughter more, as he is very angry at Mr. Wonka when Violet blows up into a blueberry. Violet's mother can be briefly seen on TV but only for a few seconds. She is a tall woman with a short bob of red hair. She was played by an uncredited actress.

Violet dressed in contemporary blue [[bell bottom]] pants. Her hair is styled in a sort of "ponytail", which is pronounced by a giant hair clip.

Interaction between Violet and Veruca isn't mentioned in the original novel, but in the 1971 version, although it is never directly referred to, it is clear the two girls instantly take a disliking to each other. Veruca gets jealous when she thinks Violet has been given more gobstoppers than she has and Violet calls Veruca a "Nit", a "Twit", and in an incorrectly-typed line, a "Twerp", which leads to a punchline in which [[Grandpa Joe]] refers to Violet as "a nitwit". Ironically, Denise Nickerson and [[Julie Dawn Cole]], who played Violet and Veruca respectively, were good friends in real life and both had crushes on [[Peter Ostrum]] who played Charlie.

Denise also said that they blew her up in a rubber suit and that they made her outline in two halves of a styrofoam ball. They put her together and it took 45 minutes for her to get into her costume. She could not go to lunch during rehersals, instead she was rolled every 5 minutes to keep blood circulating.

===Violet in 2005 film===
{{Willy Wonka character|

|caption=<small>"Violet keeps her eyes on the prize."<small>
|gender=Female
|personality=Similar to book; her competitive behavior is expanded considerably. Also, she is very cocky and overconfident.
|family=Mother [[Scarlett Beauregarde]], Father unknown
|town=[[Atlanta, Georgia]]
|portrayed=[[AnnaSophia Robb]]
|}}

In the [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|2005 movie adaption]] of the book, Violet is also a pre-teen girl, played by ten-year-old [[AnnaSophia Robb]] but she lives in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] instead of [[Miles City, Montana]], has short blonde hair in a [[page boy]] hairstyle, and a very competitive disposition, having won 263 [[trophy|trophies]] and [[medal]]s in practically anything&mdash;from [[martial arts]] competitions to gum-chewing contests, among many others. She is not only a world record holder, but a junior world champion in gum-chewing. As in the book and 1971 film adapatation, she laid off gum for a while and switched to [[chocolate bar]]s instead.

Thanks to her mother, Violet is always thinking about gum, as heard in the scene where she is shown the Everlasting Gobstoppers, saying "It's like gum" when in fact the Gobstoppers are hard. In this version, Violet's father is not seen, or even mentioned <U+2014> her parents have presumably divorced or separated, or her mother's widowed. Her [[mother]], [[Scarlett Beauregarde]] (played by [[Missi Pyle]]), is also her [[manager]] and coach, having strong confidence that Violet is going to win the special prize at the end of the factory tour. Violet and her mother both wear similar [[tracksuit]]-like outfits (in keeping with the original illustrations of Violet by [[Quentin Blake]]). They are portrayed as very similar in appearance and personality, and it is suggested that Scarlett encourages Violet's competitiveness only to continue her own legacy as a champion [[majorettes|baton twirler]].

Violet and [[Veruca Salt|Veruca]] pretend to become good friends, too -- an aspect not mentioned in the original film or novel.  In fact, in the original film, an unmentioned subplot (seen only by the girls' reactions to each other and confirmed by the actresses at later dates) has Violet and Veruca engaged in a bitter rivalry with each other, often trying to nudge the other out of the way to be the center of attention.

Violet is very cocky and she has a tendency to belittle the other Golden Ticket holders, thanks to her mother coaching her and instilling her with a cocky attitude.

==Violet's Endgame==

Violet's punishment is the same in all incarnations of the character.  After learning that Wonka has developed an experimental piece of chewing gum that is meant to simulate a full 3-course meal (in the movies the meal is [[tomato soup]], [[roast beef]] and a baked potato with all the fixings, and blueberry pie with cream/[[ice cream]]), she quickly grabs it out of his hands and begins chewing away on it contentedly.  After ecstatically tasting the first two courses of the meal, Violet gets to the blueberry pie dessert and things immediately go wrong.  She suddenly turns a deep blue and balloons up into a giant [[blueberry]].  Wonka states that for some reason the gum always goes wrong when it comes to the blueberry pie, and while he sits and ponders what could be wrong with the formula, Violet and her parents panic as Violet quickly becomes too round to even move.  Wonka then summons the Oompa Loompas to roll Violet away to the juicing room so that they can squeeze the juice out of her before she explodes.

The size of Violet's transformation differs between incarnations.  In the novel and the 1971 film, she grows merely in width, whereas in the 2005 film she grows in height as well, eventually becoming almost elephantine in size.

The fate of Violet is unknown in the first movie. She is last seen being rolled by the Oompa-Loompas to the Juicing Room to get squeezed before she exploded; at the end of the film, Wonka assures Charlie that all the other children will be their normal nasty selves. In the 2005 version, she inflates into a blueberry of elephantine proportions (much to her mother's horror), and at the end is shown exiting the factory with her mother in her normal size, and much more flexible, but still [[blue]]. This Violet, however, is actually pleased with her condition (which reinforces her widely considered role as the most sympathetic "bad" child), much to the embarrassment (and possible regret) of her mother. In the book, she survives as well, retaining [[purple]] skin, though increased flexibility is not mentioned.

==Violet Beauregarde Song==
[[Image:VioletBlueberry01.jpg|thumb|right|Violet Beauregarde after blowing up into a giant [[blueberry]] in the 2005 film.]]
This song takes place in the Inventing Room. It is sung by Oompa-Loompas after Violet is turned into a blueberry.

===What it Talks About===
The original song talks about "Miss Bigelow", who chewed gum all day for years before her jaws bit her [[tongue]] in two. In the 1971 version, the song talks about how chewing gum for long periods of time is repulsive. The 2005 version restored part of Dahl's original lyrics, particularly the part about her tongue bitten in two.

===Times sung===
In the book, it is sung while the Oompa-Loompas roll Violet into the boat and take her to the Juicing Room. In the 1971 version, it is sung as the Oompa-Loompas roll Violet out of the Inventing Room. In the 2005 version, it is sung as the Oompa-Loompas roll her around the Inventing Room and then into the boat (they also ignore Violet's terrified screams).

===Portion of lyrics===
====Book====

''Dear friends, we surely all agree<br/>There is nothing worse to see<br/>Than some young repulsive bum<br/>Who's always chewing chewing gum<br/>(It's very near as bad as those<br/>who sit around and pick the nose).

====1971 Film====
''Gum chewing's fine when it's once in a while,<br/>It stops you from [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and brightens your smile<br/>But it<U+2019>s repulsive, revolting, and wrong<br/>Chewing and chewing all day long<br/>The way that a [[cow]] does.''

====2005 Film====
''Listen close and listen hard,<br/>To the tale of Violet Beauregarde.<br/>This gentle girl, she sees no wrong,<br/>In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing, all day long.*<br/>Chewing, chewing all day long!<br/>Chewing, chewing all day long!<br/>Chewing, chewing all day long!
