The '''63rd Boat Race''' took place on 7 April 1906.  Held annually, the Boat Race is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]]. Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1905|previous year's race]], and their crew was slightly heavier than their opponents.  In a race umpired by [[Frederick I. Pitman]], Cambridge won by three-and-a-half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 25 seconds, the fastest winning time for four years.  The win took the overall record to 34&ndash;28 in Oxford's favour.
