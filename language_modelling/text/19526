'''U.S. Route 202''' is a [[U.S. Highway]] running from [[New Castle, Delaware]] northeast to [[Bangor, Maine]]. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]], the route runs {{convert|80.31|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} from the [[New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]] at the [[Pennsylvania]] border in [[Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Delaware Township]], [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon County]] near [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] northeast to the [[New York]] border in [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]], [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. Along the route<U+2019>s journey, it passes through a variety of suburban and rural environments, including the communities of [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]], [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]], [[Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey|Parsippany-Troy Hills]], [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], and [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]] as well as five counties: Hunterdon, [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]], and Bergen. U.S. Route 202 encounters many major roads in New Jersey, including [[New Jersey Route 31|Route 31]], [[U.S. Route 206]], [[U.S. Route 22 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 22]], [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], [[U.S. Route 46]], [[New Jersey Route 23|Route 23]], and [[New Jersey Route 17|Route 17]]. From Somerville to the New York border, U.S. Route 202 generally runs within a close distance of [[Interstate 287]] and interchanges with that route several times. The road ranges from a four-lane [[freeway]] between Lambertville and Ringoes in Hunterdon County to a two-lane undivided road through much of the northern portion of the route. North of the [[New Jersey Route 53|Route 53]] intersection in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]], U.S. Route 202 is maintained by individual counties rather than the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] with a few exceptions.

In the [[History of state highways in New Jersey (pre-1927)|original system]] of New Jersey state highways, present-day U.S. Route 202 was legislated as [[Pre-1927 Route 5 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 5]] between Morristown and Morris Plains in 1916 and as [[Pre-1927 Route 16 (New Jersey)|pre-1927 Route 16]] between Somerville and Morristown in 1921. In 1927, the current route was designated as [[New Jersey Route 29|Route 29]] between Lambertville and Ringoes, [[New Jersey Route 30|Route 30]] (now Route 31) between Ringoes and Flemington, [[New Jersey Route 12|Route 12]] between Flemington and Somerville, [[New Jersey Route 31 (1927-1953)|Route 31]] (now U.S. Route 206) between Somerville and Bedminster, '''Route 32''' between Bedminster and Mountain View, and Route 23 within a portion of Wayne. Meanwhile, '''U.S. Route 122''' was signed in New Jersey to run from the [[New Hope-Lambertville Bridge]] in Lambertville, where the route continued south to [[State Road, Delaware]], along Bridge Street, Route 29, and Route 30 to Flemington, and then along present-day [[County Route 523 (New Jersey)|County Route 523]] to U.S. Route 22 in [[Whitehouse, New Jersey|White House]]. In the mid 1930s, U.S. Route 122 was renumbered to U.S. Route 202, and realigned to follow its current route to New York border near [[Suffern, New York]] where it continued to [[Bangor, Maine]]. In 1953, all the state highway designations were removed from U.S. Route 202 except for Route 23 and Route 30 (which became Route 69 before becoming Route 31 in 1967) to avoid long concurrencies with the route. In the 1960s, plans were made to upgrade U.S. Route 202 to a freeway between the Pennsylvania border and Interstate 287 in Bridgewater Township. The only parts of this freeway that were completed were a bypass of Ringoes in the 1960s and a freeway between the Delaware River and Ringoes in 1974; the rest was canceled due to opposition from residents along the route. With the completion of the U.S. Route 202 freeway in Hunterdon County, the former alignment became [[New Jersey Route 179|Route 179]]. The portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23 in Wayne was upgraded from a four-lane road to a six-lane road in the 1980s.

Plans for a limited-access highway along the U.S. Route 202 corridor date back to 1932 when a [[parkway]] was planned to continue into Pennsylvania along U.S. Route 202; this proposal never came to fruition.<ref name=nycroads>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/US-202_NJ/ |title=US 202 Freeway (New Jersey)|author=Anderson, Steve|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref> In the 1960s, a bypass around Ringoes opened for U.S. Route 202 and Route 69 (which became Route 31 in 1967) with the former alignment of U.S. Route 202 through town becoming Route 179.<ref name="chevron">{{cite map|publisher=[[Chevron Oil Company]]|title= Map of New Jersey |year=1969|cartography=[[H.M.

The portion of this freeway between the Pennsylvania border and the Route 179 interchange in Ringoes was legislated in 1969 with the [[New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge]] opening in 1971.<ref name=nycroads/> The freeway opened in October 1974, and the former alignment of U.S. Route 202 between Lambertville and Ringoes became an extension of Route 179. Meanwhile, the portion of the proposed U.S. Route 202 freeway between Lambertville and Bridgewater Township was cancelled due to opposition from residents along the route.<ref name=nycroads/>

In the 1980s, upgrades were made to the portion of U.S. Route 202 concurrent with Route 23. This portion of road, which was originally a four-lane undivided road, saw an upgrade to a six-lane freeway south of the Alps Road interchange and to a six-lane surface road north of there. Construction on these improvements began in 1983 and were completed in 1986.<ref name=nycroads2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NJ-23/ |title=NJ 23 Freeway|author=Anderson, Steve|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=2009-01-06}}</ref>There were also plans to replace the Flemington Circle with an interchange as part of a project that would have also built a limited-access bypass of Flemington for Route 31; however, this plan was never realized.<ref name=nycroads3>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/NJ-31/ |title=NJ 31 Freeway (unbuilt)|author=Anderson, Steve|publisher=Eastern Roads|accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref><ref name=docstoc>{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2600956/Scaled-down-Rt-31-bypass-the-future-of-Jersey-roads|title=Scaled down Rt. 31 bypass the future of Jersey roads|publisher=.docstoc|accessdate=2008-12-11}}</ref>
