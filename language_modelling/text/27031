[[FBI]] [[Special Agent]] '''Dana Katherine Scully''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], is a [[fictional character]] and one of the two [[protagonist]]s of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Dana Scully is played by [[Gillian Anderson]]. She also appeared in two theatrical films based on the series. Scully is a [[Special Agent]] of the United States' [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], partnered with fellow Special Agent [[Fox Mulder]] for the first seven seasons, and in the eighth and ninth seasons partnered with [[John Doggett]]. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to investigate unsolved cases labeled "[[X-File]]s"; as of the second film, Scully had left government employment and worked as a surgeon in a private [[Catholic]] hospital. In contrast to Mulder's credulous "believer" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a "believer" after [[Colonist (The X-Files)|Mulder's abduction]] at the end of season seven.

She has appeared in all but four episodes of ''The X-Files'', and additionally appears in the [[20th Century Fox]] films ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]'', released in 1998 (sometimes subtitled ''Fight the Future''), and ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', released 10 years later. The episodes she does not appear in are "[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]," "[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]," "[[Unusual Suspects]]," and "[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]." She appears only briefly in "[[The Gift (The X-Files)|The Gift]]," in a flashback which reuses footage from a previous episode.

Dana Katherine Scully was born on February 23, 1964, to William and [[List of The X-Files characters#Margaret Scully|Margaret Scully]], into a close-knit [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] family.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Miracle Man (The X-Files) | title=Miracle Man | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Michael Lange]] | writers = [[Howard Gordon]] & [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref><ref name="One Breath">{{cite episode| episodelink=One Breath | title=One Breath | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.

As a young girl, Scully's favorite book was ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' and she came to nickname her father "[[Moby-Dick#Ahab|Ahab]]" from the book, and in return, he called her "[[Moby-Dick#Mates|Starbuck]]." Due to this she named her dog [[Queequeg]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Quagmire (The X-Files) | title=Quagmire | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = Kim Newton | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 3 | number = 22}}</ref>

Scully attended [[University of Maryland, College Park|The University of Maryland]], and received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Physics]]. Her undergraduate thesis was titled ''[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Twin paradox|Twin Paradox]]: A New Interpretation.''<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Jersey Devil (The X-Files) | title=The Jersey Devil | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Joe Napolitano]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 1 | number = 5}}</ref> Scully earned her [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] medical degree from [[Stanford University]].<ref>http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0004843/bio</ref> While in medical school she was recruited by the [[FBI]]; she accepted the agency's offer of employment because she felt she could distinguish herself there. Upon being partnered with [[Fox Mulder]], she maintained her medical skills by acting as a [[forensic pathologist]], often performing or consulting on autopsies of victims on [[X-File|X-Files cases]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The X-Files (pilot episode) | title=Pilot | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Robert Mandel]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 1 | number = 1}}</ref>

In the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] Scully is kidnapped by an ex-FBI mental patient named Duane Barry,<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Duane Barry | title=Duane Barry | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 5}}</ref> and is then taken from Barry by a military covert operation that were working with the [[Colonist (The X-Files)|alien conspirators]],<ref name="Ascension">{{cite episode| episodelink=Ascension (The X-Files) | title=Ascension| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Michael Lange]] | writers = Paul Brown | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 6}}</ref> but is later returned.<ref name="One Breath"/> In the third season she finds out that a super hi-tech microchip was implanted in the back of her neck. After having it removed, she developed [[cancer]] in the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Memento Mori (The X-Files) | title=Memento Mori | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Frank Spotnitz]], [[Vince Gilligan]] & John Shiban | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 4 | number = 15}}</ref>

She is hospitalized after her cancer becomes terminal. She is saved when Mulder breaks into the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to retrieve another chip to be implanted back into her neck. It should be mentioned that, at the time, Scully was also undergoing experimental medical treatments and was having a dramatic renewal of her faith.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Redux (The X-Files) | title=Redux | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.

After being pronounced [[infertile]] in the fifth season, Scully mysteriously became pregnant in the show's [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season finale]], "[[Requiem (The X-Files)|Requiem]]".<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Requiem (The X-Files) | title=Requiem | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 5 | number = 1 & 2}}</ref> The child, named William, after her own father, as well as Mulder's father, was born at the end of the [[The X-Files (season 8)|eighth season]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Existence (The X-Files) | title=Existence | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 8 | number = 21}}</ref> The cause of her pregnancy is never formally revealed; however the most probable of theories is that Mulder fathered the child, as growing intimacy in the later portion of the series implies a sexual relationship between the two (season 7 episode "[[all things]]" is seen as proof due to its opening scene, though the remainder of the episode takes place prior to the opening scene, and the closing scene can also be interpreted as proof against this).  Also, in the film, ''[[X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', Mulder calls William "our son." Beyond this, the pair had unsuccessfully tried for a child through [[in vitro fertilization]]. It was around this time that Mulder was fired from the [[FBI]] by Deputy Director [[Alvin Kersh]],<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Vienen | title=Vienen | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Rod Hardy]] | writers = [[Steven Maeda]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 8 | number = 18}}</ref> and Scully left the field to teach forensics at [[FBI Academy|Quantico]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Nothing Important Happened  Today | title=Nothing Important Happened Today | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 9 | number = 1 & 2}}</ref> William was given up for adoption during the end of the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]] after Scully felt she could no longer provide the safety that William needed.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=William (The X-Files) | title=William | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Duchovny]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], [[Frank Spotnitz]] & Duchovny | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 9 | number = 16}}</ref> William was a "miracle child", of some importance to the alien Conspiracy.

In ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'' she is shown working as a [[medical doctor]] at the Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital in Virginia. Early on in the film Scully is contacted by the FBI who are looking for Fox Mulder in the hope that he will assist them with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help the charges against him will be dropped. Unlike Mulder, Scully was apparently not considered a fugitive by the FBI. However, she did continue to maintain her romantic relationship with Mulder throughout the six years that he was on the run from the American government. In the movie they are shown to be living together in a secluded house.<ref name="I Want to Believe">{{cite episode| episodelink=The X-Files: I Want to Believe | title=The X-Files: I Want to Believe | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = | number = 2 of 2}}</ref>

=== Characterization ===
Throughout the series, her Catholic faith served as a cornerstone, although at times a contradiction to her otherwise rigid skepticism of the paranormal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kowalski|first=Dean|title=The Philosophy of The X-Files|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=50|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p4-l9zCtMHgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=X-Files&hl=en&ei=h9bTTpmmBoSztwfv5qy7CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=X-Files&f=false}}</ref>  Due to her career in science and medicine, she drifted from her Catholic Christian upbringing but remained somewhat entrenched in her religious beliefs. Scully almost always wears a gold [[cross necklace]], given to her by her mother as a Christmas present when she was fifteen. When she was abducted by Duane Barry, a self-proclaimed alien abductee,<ref name="Ascension"/> it was the only item left behind in Barry's getaway car. Mulder wore it as a talisman of her until Scully miraculously reappeared in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hospital.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=3 (The X-Files) | title=3 | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Nutter]] | writers = Chris Ruppenthal, [[Glen Morgan]] & [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 7}}</ref> After she recovered from the trauma of her abduction, he returned the cross to her.<ref name="One Breath"/>

The abduction visibly tested the limits of her faith <U+2014> Mulder believes that Scully was taken aboard an alien spaceship and was subjected to tests. However, because of Scully's skepticism, she believes she was kidnapped by men and subjected to tests, not aliens. She believes she could have been brought there by Barry, and she began to exhibit symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] on a case involving a murdering [[fetishist]] named [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files#Season two|Donnie Pfaster]].<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Irresistible (The X-Files) | title=Irresistible | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Nutter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 2 | number = 13}}</ref> This psychological [[re-victimization]] continued after Pfaster escaped from prison five years later and again attempted to kill her in her home, ending only after she fatally shot him. She struggled with what motivated her actions to kill Pfaster, and questioned whether it was God compelling her to kill him, or "something else."<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Orison (The X-Files) | title=Orison | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] | writers = [[Chip Johannessen]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 7 | number = 7}}</ref>

Sometime after her recovery, Scully began to regularly attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] again. At the request of [[List of The X-Files characters#Father McCue|Father McCue]], Scully got involved in a case concerning a [[paraplegic]] girl who was found dead in a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was part of a set of quadruplets and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the [[seraphim]] and the [[nephilim]], which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=All Souls (The X-Files) | title=All Souls| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Allen Coulter]] | writers = [[Frank Spotnitz]] & John Shiban | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 5 | number = 17}}</ref>

=== Relationships ===
While in medical school, she carried on an affair with her married instructor, Dr. Daniel Waterston who may have been the "college boyfriend" mentioned in "Trust No 1." It is never indicated in the show whether or not the relationship became sexual. According to Anderson in the episode's audio commentary, Scully came very close to having an affair with the married Waterston but left before she could break up his marriage. The end of her relationship with Waterston came about following her decision to go into the FBI.<ref name="Allthings">{{cite episode| episodelink=all things | title=all things | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Gillian Anderson]] | writers = [[Gillian Anderson]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 7 | number = 17}}</ref> After her entrance to the FBI's Academy at [[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]], Scully began a year-long relationship with her Academy instructor, Jack Willis, with whom she shared a birthday.<ref name="Lazarus"/>

Towards the end of the series, her previously platonic friendship with partner [[Fox Mulder]] developed into a romantic relationship. When Mulder was injured in a boat crash, he awakened in a hospital and told Scully that he loved her.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Triangle (The X-Files) | title=Triangle | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 6 | number = 3}}</ref> In the season six episode "[[How the Ghosts Stole Christmas]]", a ghost that seems to know the inner workings of Scully's mind suggests that her source of intimacy for Mulder comes from her desire to always prove him wrong.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=How the Ghosts Stole Christmas | title=How the Ghosts Stole Christmas | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 6 | number = 6}}</ref> By the end of the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]], Mulder and Scully were increasingly shown enjoying more light-hearted activities together, such as practicing baseball,<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Unnatural (The X-Files) | title=The Unnatural | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[David Duchovny]] | writers = [[David Duchovny]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 6 | number = 19}}</ref> using FBI funds for a "night out" during a movie premiere,<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Hollywood A.D. | title=Hollywood A.D. | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Allen Coulter]] | writers = [[Frank Spotnitz]] & John Shiban | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 7 | number = 19}}</ref> and watching a movie at Mulder's apartment.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Je Souhaite (The X-Files) | title=Je Souhaite | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Allen Coulter]] | writers = [[Frank Spotnitz]] & John Shiban | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 7 | number = 21}}</ref> In the season seven episode ''[[all things]]'', Scully is shown getting dressed in Mulder's bathroom, while Mulder sleeps, apparently naked, in the bedroom.<ref name="Allthings"/> In another episode, a man reveals to Scully that he works for a [[New Syndicate|"new" Syndicate]] like-organization, and his job requires him and a few other colleagues to spy on her around the clock. Due to this he knows intimate details of Scully's personal life, right down to her "natural hair color". It is suggested by this man that Scully ultimately initiated a sexual relationship with Mulder, as he remarked that he was very surprised when she invited Mulder "into her bed".<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=Trust No 1 | title=Trust No 1| series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Tony Wharmby]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 9 | number = 8}}</ref> The last scene of the series finale featured Mulder and Scully holding each other on a bed, facing an uncertain future together.<ref>{{cite episode| episodelink=The Truth (The X-Files) | title=The Truth | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] | season = 9 | number = 19 & 20}}</ref>

In the film, ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]'', which takes place six years later, Mulder and Scully are still in a relationship and are now living together in rural Virginia. Scully was concerned that Mulder's continuing pursuit of the unknown was taking its toll on their relationship and they could not be together if he couldn't "escape the darkness." However, the film ends with the couple sharing a passionate kiss, and in the "secret ending" after the majority of the credits, a happily smiling Scully is seen in a small rowboat with Mulder, both clad in swimwear, in a tropical sea, having taken him up on his offer to run away together.<ref name="I Want to Believe"/>

== Conceptual history ==
[[File:GillianAndersonByIdoCarmelWonderCon2008.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Gillian Anderson portrayed Agent Scully.]]
[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] named Scully after his favorite sportscaster, [[Vin Scully]] of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. [[John Doggett]] was likewise named after Vin Scully's longtime broadcasting partner, [[Jerry Doggett]].<ref name=levine20110130>{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Ken|title=Naming characters on TV shows|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/01/one-of-hardest-tasks-in-any-script-is.html|accessdate=2011-01-30|newspaper=kenlevine.blogspot.com|date=2011-01-30}}</ref> Scully's character was also inspired by [[Jodie Foster]]'s portrayal of [[Clarice Starling]] in the film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''.<ref>Lowry, p.15</ref> Scully was a known name in [[UFO]] lore. In 1950 the less than credible ''Behind the Flying Saucers'' was published, written by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' columnist [[Frank Scully]]. The name Scully was also used in 1976 film ''[[All the President's Men]]'', an obvious inspiration for the show, in a list of names who work for the [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]].

The casting for Scully caused a conflict between Carter and the Fox network. Carter had chosen 24-year-old [[Gillian Anderson]], who Carter felt was perfect for the role.<ref name="Lowry 15-17" /> Of her audition, Carter said, "she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [...] she was the right person for the part".<ref name="Pilot Speaks">{{cite video |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]  (narrator) |title=Chris Carter Speaks about Season One Episodes: Pilot|medium=DVD |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]}}</ref> However, Fox executives had wanted a more glamorous "bombshell" for the part, hoping that this would lead to the series involving a romantic element. This led Carter to insist that he did not want the roles of Mulder and Scully to become romantically involved.<ref name="Lowry 15-17">Lowry, pp.15<U+2013>17</ref> Carter decided Scully would be the skeptic to play against established [[stereotypes]]; typically on television the quality was attributed to a male.<ref name="Pilot Speaks" />

Scully appears in every episode of the nine-season series with the exceptions of "[[3 (The X-Files)|3]]", "[[Zero Sum (The X-Files)|Zero Sum]]", "[[Unusual Suspects]]" and "[[Travelers (The X-Files)|Travelers]]". She has appeared outside ''The X-Files'' on numerous occasions, the most notable being in the ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'' (also created by Chris Carter) episode "Lamentation," in which the main character, Frank Black, visits the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, and Mulder and Scully are briefly seen descending a stairway. In fact, they are Duchovny and Anderson's [[stand-in]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourthhorseman.com/Abyss/Episodes/epi117.htm |title=Millennium Episode 117}}</ref> An animated version of Scully, which featured the voice acting of Anderson, would appear on [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season 8]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in the episode "[[The Springfield Files]]", as well as Canadian animated series ''[[Eek! The Cat]]'', on the episode "Eek Space 9". The animated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'' featured characters Fax Modem and Data Nully, obvious spoofs of Mulder and Scully, in the episode "Trust No One". Anderson provided her voice work for the episode, but co-star Duchovny declined.

Film critic Scott Mendelson, writing in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', cited Scully as an example of strong female characters on television, calling her "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre".<ref>{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Mendelson|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-mendelson/why-wonder-woman-belongs_b_817905.html|title=Why Wonder Woman Belongs on Television, Where Female Superheroes Thrive|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=3 February 2011|accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref> ''[[Radio Times]]''{{'s}} Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1.<ref>{{cite web|first=Laura|last=Pledger|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-08/ten-strong-tv-women|title=Ten Strong TV women|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> Rebecca Traister of [[Salon.com]] opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, "The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, we saw it crack, sparks fly from it.
