'''M-38''' is an east-west [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (UP) of the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. It starts in [[Ontonagon, Michigan|Ontonagon]] and runs east to [[Baraga, Michigan|Baraga]], some {{convert|42.174|mi|km|3}} apart. The highway crosses streams and rivers in forest lands and provides access to a casino. The west end is located by the [[Keweenaw Bay]] of [[Lake Superior]] in the [[L'Anse_Indian_Reservation|Keweenaw Bay Indian Community]].

There have been two highways in the state to carry the designation. The first was located in the southeastern [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. The current version of M-38 was created from a section of [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]] in the 1960s. This section was orphaned from the rest of M-35 when the highway was cancelled through the [[Huron Mountains]].

==Route description==
M-38 begins at a four-way intersection in Ontonagon. [[U.S. Route 45 in Michigan|US Highway 45]] (US&nbsp;45) runs north<U+2013>south through this intersection while [[M-64 (Michigan highway)|M-64]] runs west and M-38 runs east on Steel Street. This intersection is both the eastern terminus of M-64 and the western terminus of M-38. From here, M-38 forms a segment of the [[Lake Superior Circle Tour]] along Ontonagon<U+2013>Greenland Road to a junction with [[M-26 (Michigan highway)|M-26]] near [[Greenland, Michigan|Greenland]]. The roadway runs through forest land and crosses several small streams while traveling southeasterly. Outside of Greenland, M-38 curves to the north around town after intersecting Plank Road. On the east side of town, M-26 and M-38 meet and join in a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] after Ontonagon<U+2013>Greenland Road meets Plank Road a second time. The two highways run together for just over a mile to the unincorporated community of Lake Mine. There, M-38 turns south through the community while M-26 turns off to the northeast.<ref name="google">{{cite map |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-45+%26+M-38,+Ontonagon,+MI+49953&geocode=&dirflg=&daddr=US-41+%26+M-38,+Baraga,+MI&f=d&sll=46.866772,-89.313784&sspn=0.00933,0.014505&ie=UTF8&z=10 |title=US-45 & M-38, Ontonagon, MI 49953 to US-41 & M-38, Baraga, MI 49908 |publisher=[[Google Maps]] |cartography=NAVTEQ |year= 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>

The highway crosses a set of railroad tracks before turning east. At Post Office Road, M-38 meets a road named Old M-35 Road, a vestige of a highway straightening project during the time the highway was M-35. M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Firesteel River in hilly terrain through this area.<ref name="googleOldM-35">{{cite map |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=US-45+%26+M-38,+Ontonagon,+MI+49953&geocode=&dirflg=&daddr=US-41+%26+M-38,+Baraga,+MI&f=d&sll=46.866772,-89.313784&sspn=0.00933,0.014505&ie=UTF8&ll=46.771879,-89.013505&spn=0.018694,0.029011&t=p&z=15 |title=Old M-35 Road |publisher=Google Maps |cartography=TeleAtlas |date=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref> The highway continues east and provides access to the Courtney Lake National Forest Campground west of the [[Houghton County, Michigan|Houghton County]] line. East of [[Forest Route|Federal Forest Highway 16]] (FFH-16) near [[Nisula, Michigan|Nisula]], M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Otter River. It is along this section of roadway in Houghton County that the lowest [[annual average daily traffic]] (AADT) counts were measured by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) in 2007. An average of 680&nbsp;vehicles traveled on the roadway, according to MDOT surveys.<ref name="aadtMI">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/adtfront_20092_7.pdf |title=Statewide AADT Map |date=2007 |accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> Of those vehicles, only 40&nbsp;trucks on average were included in the traffic counts.<ref name="caadtMI">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/cadtfront_19920_7.pdf |title=Commercial Statewide AADT Map | date=2007 |accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> East of Nisula, the roadway runs parallel to Mill Creek. Mill Creek flows into the West Branch of the Sturgeon River near the [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga County]] line.<ref name="google"/>

==History==
===Previous designation===
The first version of M-38 was designated in 1919 in the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]]. It was located on Junction Road from [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] (later [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]]/[[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|US&nbsp;23]]) southeast of [[Bridgeport, Michigan|Bridgeport]] to [[Frankenmuth, Michigan|Frankenmuth]] and Saginaw Road east to [[M-19 (Michigan highway)|M-19]] in the [[Peck, Michigan|Peck]] area in 1919.<ref name="MSHD19">{{cite map |publisher=[[Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |url= http://maps.lib.msu.edu/miroadmaps/1919-lp.htm |year=1919 |cartography= MSHD |accessdate=2008-03-02 }}</ref> The highway was transferred to county jurisdiction in late 1961 when the [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]]/US&nbsp;10/US&nbsp;23 freeway was completed in the area.<ref name="MSHD61">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year=1961 |section=J12<U+2013>J14}} (Includes all changes through July 1, 1961)</ref><ref name="MSHD62">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Map |year= 1962 |section=J12<U+2013>J14}}</ref>

===Current designation===
{{main|M-35 (Michigan highway)}}
In 1968, the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] redesignated the western section of [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]] as M-38.<ref name="MDSH68"/><ref name="MDSH69"/> M-35 was originally planned to start in [[Menominee, Michigan|Menominee]] and run north to Big Bay, turn west through the [[Huron Mountains]] in northern [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]] and run west from Baraga to Ontonagon.<ref name="MSHD19">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=State of Michigan: Upper Peninsula |url=http://maps.lib.msu.edu/miroadmaps/1919_up.htm |year=1919 |cartography= MSHD |accessdate=2008-03-02 }}</ref> The Huron Mountains portion of M-35 was never built due to opposition from [[Henry Ford]] and the [[Huron Mountain Club]]. This left M-35 discontinuous.<ref name="MSHD38-05">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1938 Official Michigan Highway Map |year=May 1, 1938 |edition=Spring |cartography=Rand McNally |section=B3}}</ref> It was later routed along US&nbsp;41 from Negaunee to Baraga, connecting the two sections until the western section was given the M-38 designation.<ref name="MDSH68"/><ref name="MSHD53-04">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1953 Official Highway Map |year=April 15, 1953 |section=B3}}</ref>

The original routing of M-38 in the Upper Peninsula ran from M-26 at Greenland to Baraga.<ref name="MDSH69"/> US&nbsp;45 was rerouted in 1971 along M-26 from [[Rockland, Michigan|Rockland]] to Greenland and Ontonagon<U+2013>Greenland Road between those two towns. M-26 was shortened to end at the new US&nbsp;45 in Greenland. <ref name="MDSH70">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1970 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi. |section=B3}}</ref> This change to US&nbsp;45 was reversed in 1973. M-26 was reextended to Rockland, and M-38 was extended along M-26 to Ontonagon<U+2013>Greenland Road to meet US&nbsp;45 in Ontonagon.<ref name="MDSH71">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1971 |scale=1 in.:14.5 mi. |section=B3}}</ref>

On October 11, 2006, the western terminus of M-38 was relocated about {{convert|.25|mi|km|2}} south to end at a junction with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]] and the newly realigned [[M-64 (Michigan highway)|M-64]].<ref name="MDOTORB">{{cite press release| publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11057-153223--,00.html |title= New Ontonagon River Bridge to open Oct. 11 |date=October 10, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-08}}</ref>
