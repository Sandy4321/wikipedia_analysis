'''New York State Route 164''' is a short state highway located entirely in the [[Patterson, New York|Town of Patterson]] in northwestern [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]]. It is a former component of [[New York State Route 216|NY 216]] that retained its state highway status.

NY 164 is a short, two-lane back road that does not pass through any major populated areas. It does, however, allow faster passage from [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] to the [[Putnam Lake, New York|Putnam Lake]] area, via [[New York State Route 311|NY 311]].

==Route description==
In the west, NY 164 splits off from [[New York State Route 311|NY 311]] a short distance north of [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]]. It crosses under the [[Harlem Line (Metro-North)|Metro North]] tracks three times, including two one-lane underpasses with limited sight to the other side, before reaching Towners (site of a now-closed passenger station), then straightens out as it passes Mendel Pond on its way to its eastern end, a junction with [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] at Haines Corners.

==History==
The entirety of NY 164 was originally designated as [[New York State Route 312|NY 312]] in the early to mid-1930s.<ref>{{cite map |title=Road Map & Historical Guide - New York |publisher=[[Sun Oil Company]] |year=1935 |cartography=[[Rand McNally and Company]]}}</ref> When the NY 312 designation was shifted south to its current location in the town of [[Southeast, New York|Southeast]] by 1938, its former routing in [[Patterson, New York|Patterson]] became part of an extended [[New York State Route 216|NY 216]], which connected with its current routing by way of modern [[New York State Route 311|NY 311]], [[New York State Route 292|NY 292]] and [[New York State Route 55|NY 55]].<ref>''Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book'', 1938/39 edition, (W.A. Thibodeau, 1938).</ref> NY 216 was truncated to its current length on [[January 1]], [[1970]]. The portion of its former alignment between NY 311 and [[New York State Route 22|NY 22]] was then redesignated as NY 164.<ref name=1970log>{{cite web|url=http://www.greaternyroads.info/pdfs/state70.pdf|title=Official Description of Touring Routes in New York State|date=[[1970-01-01]]|author=[[State of New York Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=2008-04-21}}</ref>

Several streets in the [[Bronx]] and [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] once carried the 164 designation before it was removed in 1961.<ref>[http://www.gribblenation.net/nyroutes/ind/160_169.htm#164 New York Routes - New York State Route 164]</ref><!--this should be split into its own article - when it is, uncomment the dab atop the article-->
