After Hassan was shot, onlookers tried to help him, but he fainted from losing so much blood. They took him to a nearby house to receive first aid but the wound had hit a main blood vessel as it entered and passed through his upper leg.

== Context ==

The [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|2011 uprising]] positioned largely Shia anti-government protesters against the Sunni-led monarchy.<ref name="ibtimes" /> Shia opposition demanded that the prime minister face democratic elections rather than being appointed by Bahrain's monarchy.<ref name="ibtimes" /> Hassan died 14 months after protests began.<ref name=thesundaytimes /> Around that time, the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights had called for organized protests on behalf of its founder [[Abdulhadi al-Khawaja]] who had been arrested in April 2011 and who was hospitalized after being on a [[hunger strike]] for around 50 days.<ref name="ibtimes" /><ref name=thesundaytimes /><ref name="reuters" />

== Impact ==

After he was killed, his family and protesters demanded the cancellation of the April 22 Grand Prix event.<ref name=thesundaytimes /> They argued the Formula One race because of its worldwide visibility and the government's use of the event as a sign of national unity, lent legitimacy to the Sunni-led regime as it perpetrated human rights abuses.<ref name=thetimes /><ref name=guardian>{{cite web|author=Caroline Davies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/13/bahrain-f1-grand-prix-goes-ahead |title=Bloodshed feared as Bahrain Formula One grand prix given go-ahead &#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=April 13, 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref> Hassan's family led calls  to cancel the race.<ref name=thesundaytimes/> While Bahrain's Monarchy was divided, the Crown Prince [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa]] had pushed for the event while the King was initially not for it, but in the wake of calls for, the Grand Prix continued as planned.<ref name=mirror />

Muslims by custom are buried within 24 hours of death, but in Hassan's case the family disputed the death certificate and wouldn't take possession of the corpse.<ref name=thetimes /> Later, Mohammed Ahmed Abdel Aziz, 15-year-old boy, was shot and many other were wounded by anti-riot police at Hassan's funeral.<ref name=telegraph>{{cite news|title=Teenage protester in intensive care as Bahrain Grand Prix gets green light |publisher=Telegraph (UK) |date=April 14, 2012 |accessdate=2013-09-26 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/bahrain/9204530/Teenage-protester-in-intensive-care-as-Bahrain-Grand-Prix-gets-green-light.html}}</ref>
== Reactions ==

The tragedy provoked an outpouring of anger among the majority of Shia population in Bahrain.<ref name=thesundaytimes/> One journalist said that everywhere she went she heard people talking about Hassan.<ref name=PRI /> Another Bahraini citizen journalist who had reported on the medical treatment of Hassan wounds said she was overwhelmed by the amount of blood.<ref name=lemonde>{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/openpage/terror-and-teargas-on-the-streets-of-bahrain |first=Jen |last=Marlowe |title=Terror and teargas on the streets of Bahrain |publisher=Le Monde diplomatique - English edition |date=September 2012 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>
Working as a citizen journalist, Hassan worked independently and without assistance or support.<ref name=EAWorldNews /> Human rights organizations issued the following statements:

The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said Hassan's death was part of a systematic effort to intimidate and stop photography of protests.<ref name=BCHR />

The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] focused on the treatment of journalists: "This shooting underscores the terrible risks journalists face in recording the social and political unrest in Bahrain. Bahraini authorities must immediately investigate this death in a credible and timely manner."<ref name=cpjnews />

[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "The basic human right of freedom of expression and the freedom of journalists and citizen journalists to cover events are essential for any society that wants to uphold the principles of democracy and rule of law. I welcome reports that the authorities<U+2019> intend to launch an inquiry into this serious event and trust that the culprits will be brought to justice."<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|author=Source: Unescopress |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_calls_for_investigation_into_killing_of_citizen_journalist_ahmed_ismael_hassan_alsamadi_in_bahrain/#.UjiqHdLRh8E |title=Director-General calls for investigation into killing of citizen journalist Ahmed Ismael Hassan AlSamadi in Bahrain &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref><ref name=un>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=41727&Cr=bahrain&Cr1#.UjiqjdLRh8E |title=United Nations News Centre - Bahrain: UN top official calls for investigation into killing of citizen journalist |publisher=Un.org |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2013-09-26}}</ref>
