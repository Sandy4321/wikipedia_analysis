"'''Homer's Phobia'''" is the fifteenth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]], which originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on [[February 16]], [[1997]].<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 228}}</ref> It was the first episode written by [[Ron Hauge]] and was directed by [[Mike B. Anderson]].<ref name="book"/> [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] guest starred, providing the voice of the new character [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#John|John]].<ref name="book"/> 

In the episode, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] disassociates himself from new family friend John after discovering that John is [[gay]]. He worries that John will have a negative influence on his son, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]. "Homer's Phobia" was the first episode to revolve entirely around [[homosexual]] themes, with the title being a [[pun]] on the word "[[homophobia]]". Originally, due to the controversial subject, the Fox censors found the episode unsuitable for broadcast, but this decision was reversed after a turnover in the Fox staff. It won four awards, including an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less)]] and a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for "Outstanding TV - Individual Episode".

==Plot==
Needing money for a new [[clothes dryer]], the Simpson family visits "Cockamamie's", an offbeat [[antique]] shop, hoping that it will purchase one of the family's heirlooms. While there, Homer meets John, the antiques dealer, who explains that a lot of the merchandise is there because of its [[camp (style)|camp]] value. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are impressed with John, and Homer invites him to the Simpsons' house to see the campy items there. The next morning, Homer tells Marge that he likes John and suggests they invite him and "his wife" over. Marge hints that John is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], and when Homer finally understands he is horrified. Homer's attitude towards John changes completely, and he turns against him, refusing to join his tour of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The rest of the family join John and have a good time, and Homer is upset with the family upon their return. The rest of the Simpsons continue to enjoy John's company, especially Bart, who starts wearing [[Aloha shirt|Hawaiian shirts]] and dancing in [[drag (clothing)|drag]]. This makes Homer ill at ease, and he soon starts to fear that Bart is gay.

Homer endeavors to make Bart more masculine by forcing him to look at a [[cigarette]] [[Billboard (advertising)|billboard]] featuring scantily-clad women, but this fails to work. Homer then escorts him to see a [[steel mill]]<U+2019>s muscle-bound workforce, only to find that the factory in question moonlights as The Anvil, a gay disco. A desperate Homer insists on taking Bart deer [[hunting]] with [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] and [[Barney Gumble|Barney]]. When they cannot find any deer, they decide instead to go to Santa's Village and shoot the [[reindeer]] in the corral. This backfires when the reindeer attack them. John, with the help of Lisa and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], uses a [[Japan]]ese [[Santa Claus]] [[robot]] to scare off the reindeer and save the hunting party. Homer accepts John, more or less, and tells Bart, who is still unaware of his father's thoughts, that any way he lives his life is okay by him. After Lisa informs Bart that Homer thinks he is gay, he appears shocked. The episode ends with everyone driving off in John's car.<ref name=officialsite>{{citeweb|url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/0815.htm|title="Homer's Phobia"|accessdate=2007-03-09|publisher=The Simpsons.com}}</ref>

Just before the end credits a dedication to the steelworkers of [[United States|America]] is shown, reading "''Keep reaching for that rainbow!''"

==Theme==
The episode is a significant part of the show's exploration of [[LGBT]] themes.<ref name="Mudhar">Raju Mudhar, "Springfield's coming-out party; Cartoon to reveal gay character And it might not be Smithers," ''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 28, 2004, pg. A.03.</ref> Although there had been several references to homosexuality in the series up until then,<ref name="Mudhar"/> "Homer's Phobia" was the first episode to revolve entirely around homosexual themes.<ref name="Outing">"Springfield awaits its first outing," ''[[Calgary Herald]]'', July 29, 2004, pg. E.2.</ref>  In the earlier episode "[[Simpson and Delilah]]", the character of Karl (voiced by [[Harvey Fierstein]]) was shown kissing Homer, and the regular character [[Waylon Smithers]] is often shown to be in love with [[Montgomery Burns]], albeit suggestively.<ref>Stephen Kiehl, "Homersexual debate splits Springfield," ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', February 12, 2005, pg. L.7.</ref>  The later episodes "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]" and "[[There's Something About Marrying]]" would again center around homosexuality.<ref name="Outing"/>

==Production==
[[Image:John Waters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|175px|John Waters accepted his invitation to guest star in the episode instantly.]]
The original concept for the episode came from a piece of paper with a few lines of show ideas written on it, that had been written by [[George Meyer]].<ref name="roncom">{{cite video | people=Hauge, Ron|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> One of them simply read ''"Bart the homo"'',<ref name="roncom"/> and Ron Hauge was selected to write the episode, with the story stemming from that line.

The idea of using John Waters as a guest star had been around for a while. Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein had planned to use him in an episode that never took off called ''"Lisa and Camp"'', which revolved around Lisa "discovering the joys of all these campy things."<ref name="Billcom">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The two ideas were combined and became this episode, that was originally entitled "Bart Goes to Camp", but it was changed as "no one got it."<ref name="roncom"/>

The [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[Censorship|censor]] was completely against this episode being aired. The normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor, and being faxed back, stating a few lines and words that should be substituted.<ref name="Billcom"/> However this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line in the show, basically stating that they did not like the use of the word ''"[[gay]]"'', or the concept of homosexuality at all.<ref name="Billcom"/> The notes ended with a paragraph which stated that "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]."<ref name="Billcom"/> Usually the censor notes are just ignored as the offending lines and problems are usually dealt with after the episode has been animated.<ref name="Billcom"/> As the entire episode was deemed a problem in this case, it could not be solved.<ref name="Billcom"/> The problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from animation in [[South Korea]], the then Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well.<ref name="Billcom"/> The new censors sent back merely one line: "acceptable for broadcast."<ref name="Billcom"/>

The "gay steel mill" scene was written by Stephen Tompkins. He originally pitched the idea that they would be [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], but it was too much work to animate the lading of ships, so a steel mill was used instead.<ref name="tompkins">{{cite video | people=Tompkins, Stephen|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Tompkins also wrote a different third act for the episode, which did not make it into the final cut. Instead of Homer, Bart, Barney and Moe going deer hunting and ending up at "Santa's Village", they would go back to the steel mill.<ref name="com">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Tompkins, Steve|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There, Homer would "attempt" to prove his overwhelming heterosexuality by having a human [[tractor pulling]] contest with some of the steel mill workers, but it was decided that it "didn't really service the story".<ref name="com"/>

John Waters accepted his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating that "if it was good enough for [[Elizabeth Taylor]] it was good enough for him", but that (as he was playing a character, and not himself) "if they made him look like [[Richard Simmons]] he would have them killed."<ref name="JohnWaterscom">{{cite video | people=Waters, John|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Eighth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Phobia"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent Waters an animation cell from the episode which he now has hanging in his office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sick-boy.com/waters.htm|title=The Prince of Puke talks porn, pubes and periods|accessdate=2007-07-17|publisher=Planet Sick Boy}}</ref>

==Cultural references==
Numerous cultural references were made during this episode. The song "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]" by [[C+C Music Factory]] is played twice during the episode; the steel mill workers dance to it, and it is played in the background of the credits.<ref name="BBC"/> Homer's record collection includes music by the [[New Christy Minstrels]], Loony Luau, The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson and the song "[[Ballads of the Green Berets]]" by [[Staff Sergeant|Staff Sgt.]] [[Barry Sadler]].<ref name="BBC"/><ref name="book"/> The song that John picks out and he and Homer dance to is "[[I Love the Nightlife]]" by [[Alicia Bridges]], and the song that Bart dances to is "[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]" by [[Cher]].<ref name="BBC"/> When John is introduced there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film ''[[Pink Flamingos]]''.<ref name="book"/>

==Reception==

In 2002, ''Off the Telly'' writers Steve Williams and Ian Jones named "Homer's Phobia" one of the "five worst" episodes of ''The Simpsons''. Stating that it "leaves such a nasty taste in the mouth", as Homer is "quite simply a bastard" throughout the course of the episode. The pair concluded by saying "this is a side of the show we'd not seen before, nor particularly wanted to see."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.offthetelly.co.uk/comedy/simpsons/bestworst.htm|title=FIVE OF THE BEST ... AND FIVE OF THE WORST|accessdate=2007-05-13|author=Williams, Steve; Jones, Ian|publisher=Off the Telly}}</ref> In June 2003, Igor Smykov sued the Russian television channel [[REN TV]] on claims that ''The Simpsons'', along with ''[[Family Guy]]'', were "morally degenerate and promoted drugs, violence and homosexuality." As evidence, "Homer's Phobia" was shown to the judge to prove that ''The Simpsons'' promoted homosexuality, and thus should not be aired again on the channel. The case was thrown out after one day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/story/3199|title=Court Rules for Simpsons Cartoon|accessdate=2007-03-07|publisher=The St. Petersburg Times}}</ref>
