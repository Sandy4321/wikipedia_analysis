'''Toulouse''' ([[help:IPA|pronounced]] {{audio-IPA|Fr-Toulouse.ogg|[tu<U+02C8>luz]}} in standard [[French language|French]], and {{audio-IPA|Fr-Toulouse-Accent.ogg|[tu<U+02C8>luz<U+0259>]}} in the local accent) ([[Occitan language|Occitan]]: ''Tolosa'', pronounced {{IPA|[tu<U+02C8>luz<U+0254>]}}) is a [[commune of France|city]] in southwest [[France]] on the banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne River]], half-way between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. With 1,117,000 inhabitants in 2007, the Toulouse metropolitan area is the fourth-largest in France and the fastest growing in Europe.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Toulouse is one of the centers of the European [[aerospace]] industry, with the headquarters of [[Airbus]], [[Galileo positioning system]], the [[SPOT (satellites)|SPOT satellite system]], and [[CNES]]'s [[Toulouse Space Center]] (CST), the largest space center in Europe.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web| url=http://www.ademe.fr/midi-pyrenees/documents/a_3/cnes_dossier_presse.pdf| title=http://www.ademe.fr/midi-pyrenees/documents/a_3/cnes_dossier_presse.pdf| author=[[CNES]]| format=PDF|accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> [[Thales Alenia Space]], Europe's largest [[satellite]] manufacturer, and [[EADS Astrium Satellites]], [[EADS]]'s satellite system subsidiary, also have a significant presence in Toulouse. Its world renowned [[University of Toulouse|university]] is one of the oldest in [[Europe]] (founded in 1229) and, with more than 120,000 students, is the third largest university campus of [[France]] after [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Lyon|Lyon]].

Toulouse was the capital of the former [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Languedoc]] (provinces were abolished during the [[French Revolution]]). It is now the capital of the [[Midi-Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es]] [[R<U+00E9>gion in France|region]], the largest region in metropolitan France. It is also the capital of the [[Haute-Garonne]] [[Departements of France|department]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Toulouse}}
{{see also|Counts of Toulouse}}

Born during the Roman Empire, Toulouse was once a major metropolis of western Europe, but it sank into a sleepy regional-level status in the 18th and 19th centuries, completely missing the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In the 20th century, relocation of key military and aerospace industries in Toulouse by the French central government have awakened the city again.

Benefiting from its status as Europe's capital of aerospace industry, as well as from the flow of population from the industrial belt to the sunbelt of Europe, Toulouse metropolitan area doubled its population between 1960 and 2000 (in the meantime the population of France increased only by 30%). {{Fact|date=August 2008}}  With good prospects for [[aerospace]] and [[biotech]] industries, growth is likely to continue in the near future. {{Fact|date=August 2008}}

Note:
* figures provided by French national statistics office [[INSEE]]
* figures up to and including 1954 can be compared with each other, as the limits of the urban area did not change until 1954, being only the city of Toulouse; after 1954 the urban area starts to include suburban communes, and the limits vary year after year
* INSEE started calculating [[aire urbaine|metropolitan area]] data only in 1990, a metropolitan area being different from an urban area in that it also includes satellite towns and the agricultural land in between, thus better reflecting the modern-day phenomenon of commutes and hubs; metropolitan area data before 1990 are only estimates

The population of the city proper (French: ''[[Commune of France|commune]]'') was 390,350 (as of the 1999 census), with 964,797 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (French: ''[[aire urbaine]]'') (as of 1999 census). As of the [[January 1]], [[2005]] estimate, the population of the city proper reached 435,000 inhabitants, which means a record 1.9% population growth per year between 1999 and 2005 for the city proper.

Toulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after [[Paris]], [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. In 1999 Toulouse was the fifth largest metropolitan area in France, after Paris, Lyon, Marseille and [[Lille]].

Fueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of 1.5% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with a sluggish 0.37% for [[metropolitan France]]), and a record 2.2% yearly growth in the 2000s (0.58% for metropolitan France), means Toulouse metropolitan area hit the 1,000,000 inhabitants mark in 2002 or 2003. Boasting the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, Toulouse is well on its way to overtake Lille as the fourth largest metropolitan area and Lyon as the third largest city of France.
With 2.2% yearly population growth in the metropolitan area, Toulouse is also the fastest growing metropolitan area larger than one million inhabitants in Europe. {{Fact|date=February 2008}}

== Government and politics ==
=== Community of the Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse ===

{{main|Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse}}
The Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (''Communaut<U+00E9> d'agglom<U+00E9>ration du Grand Toulouse'') was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with less powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent ''communes'', covering an area of 380 km<U+00B2> (147 sq. miles), totaling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in.

=== Local politics ===
One of the major political figures in Toulouse was [[Dominique Baudis]], the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of center-right [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]]. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in [[Lebanon]], 36 year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father [[Pierre Baudis]] in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) The Baudis dynasty succeeded in turning Toulouse into a center-right stronghold, whereas historically the city had been left-leaning since the 19th century. Dominique Baudis is also known as a writer who wrote historical novels about the ancient [[counts of Toulouse]], their crusade in the [[Middle East]], and the [[Albigensian Crusade]].

|[[Image:Place du capitol.jpg|thumb|200px|The Capitol (Town hall) by night]]
|}
During his time as mayor, Toulouse's economy and population boomed. Baudis' policies were deliberately moderate, and he always tried to accommodate (opponents would say anesthetize) the left. {{POV-statement|date=February 2008}} He tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis|fleurs-de-lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasize the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge [[pop music]] concert venue (''Z<U+00E9>nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit<U+00E9> de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.

To deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Perhaps the one for which Baudis {{weasel-inline}} is most famous is the [[Toulouse Metro]]: line A of the subway was opened in 1993, and Baudis succeeded in having work started on line B (which opened in 2007), despite strong local opposition to the anticipated costs. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in downtown Toulouse was sharply criticized by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]], although it certainly fulfilled the demands of downtown Toulouse store and shop owners, and makes life easier for people who cannot use public transportation to go downtown. {{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Despite all these massive undertakings, the city's economy proved so strong that Dominique Baudis was able to announce, in 1999, that the city had finished repaying its debt, making it the only large city in France ever to achieve solvency. In Europe, typical per capita city debt for a city the size of Toulouse is around 1,200 euros. Achieving solvency was a long-standing goal for Baudis, who had said that he would extinguish city debt before leaving office. Local opposition, however, has criticized this achievement, saying that the task of governments is not to run zero-deficit, but to ensure the well-being of citizens, through social benefits, housing programs for poor people, etc. {{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Fact|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup<U+00E9>rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in [[Paris]], the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].

Philippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF]] plant in late 2001.

In March 2004 he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].

== Colleges and universities ==
Toulouse has the third-largest student population in France after Paris and Lyon.

The [[University of Toulouse]] (''Universit<U+00E9> de Toulouse''), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in [[Oxford]] and [[Paris]], the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology - inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts - as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church in hopes to reconcile Greek Philosophy and Christian Theology. Today, Toulouse is the third largest university campus of France after Paris and Lyon, with more than 97,000 students attending its three universities ([[Universit<U+00E9> Toulouse I]], [[Universit<U+00E9> de Toulouse - Le Mirail (Toulouse II)]], [[Universit<U+00E9> Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)]]) and its engineering schools ([[Institut Catholique des Arts et Metiers|ICAM Toulouse]], [[INSA Toulouse]], [[<U+00C9>cole Nationale Sup<U+00E9>rieure de l'A<U+00E9>ronautique et de l'Espace|SUPAERO]], [[ENSICA]], [[<U+00C9>cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile|ENAC]], [[<U+00C9>cole Nationale Sup<U+00E9>rieure d'<U+00C9>lectronique, d'<U+00C9>lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique, et de T<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>communications|ENSEEIHT]], [[Ecole Nationale Sup<U+00E9>rieure d'Ing<U+00E9>nieurs en Art Chimique Et Technologique|ENSIACET]], [[Ecole pour l'Informatique et les Nouvelles Technologies|EPITECH]], [[Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc<U+00E9>es|IPSA]], [[INPT]]).

Toulouse also hosts the [[Industrial Economics Institute]] (Institut D'Economie Industrielle, IDEI) that is become one of the best European research centres in economics as well as its associated graduate school (TSE - [[Toulouse School of Economics]]) that recruits the ablest students from all countries in the European Union and further afield, as well as the [[Toulouse Business School (ESCT)]], one of France's leading integrated management schools.

The most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc<U+00E9>e Pierre de Fermat and Lyc<U+00E9>e Saint-Sernin.

== Transport ==
In addition to an extensive bus system, the [[Toulouse Metro]] system is a [[VAL]] (V<U+00E9>hicule Automatique L<U+00E9>ger) [[rapid transit|metro]] system made up of driverless (automatic) [[rubber-tired underground|rubber-tired]] trains. Line A runs for 12.5km from Balma-Gramont to Basso Cambo. Line B, which opened in June 2007, adds 20 stations and intersects line A at Jean Jaur<U+00E8>s. Line E (tramway) is going to be finished in 2009, and will roll from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. Line C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but a classical railway line with SNCF trains; it connects to line A at Ar<U+00E8>nes. Another oft-used commuter train line (D) runs to the city of Muret.

Airports include:
* [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport|Toulouse Blagnac]], the principal local airport
* [[Toulouse-Lasbordes|Toulouse Lasbordes]]
Railway stations include:
* [[Gare de Toulouse Matabiau|Toulouse-Matabiau]]

Toulouse is home to Bonhoure Radio Tower, a 61-metre high lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission.<ref>{{Structurae|id=s0014245|title=Bonhoure Transmission Tower}}</ref>

== Culture ==
[[Image:Ville Rose.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A "Pink City" apartment at sunset]]
Toulouse, known as the ''Ville Rose'' ("[[List of Pink Cities|Pink City]]") for its distinctive brick architecture {{Fact|date=March 2008}}, is host to a rich and diverse culture. It has a thriving scene of unusually beautiful [[graffiti]], with the painter [[Miss Van]] at its forefront. 

Toulouse was the home of [[Antoine de Saint-Exup<U+00E9>ry]] (1900-1944), most famous for his book ''[[Le Petit Prince]]'' (The Little Prince). There is a permanent gallery with numerous photos, and some of his works, located in the ''Hotel du Grand Balcon'' - just off the ''Place du Capitole'' - where he stayed. (The [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] lived in Paris and was born in nearby Albi). 

It is the seat of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie des Jeux Floraux]], the equivalent of the [[French Academy]] for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of [[Occitania|Occitan culture]]. The traditional [[Occitan cross]] was adopted as the symbol of both the City of Toulouse and the newly-founded Midi-Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es ''r<U+00E9>gion''.

The city's gastronomic specialties include ''Saucisses de Toulouse'', a type of herb [[sausage]], ''[[cassoulet]]'' Toulousain, a bean and pork [[stew]], and ''[[garbure]]'', a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, [[foie gras]], the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy mainly made in the Midi-Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es.

===Sport===
In sports, it boasts a highly respected [[rugby union]] team, [[Stade Toulousain]], which has been a four-time finalist, three-time winner in Europe's top club competition in the sport, the [[Heineken Cup]] and 17 times [[Top 14|French champions]]. Toulouse is considered a centre for rugby union,{{Fact|date=July 2008}} and the city hosted games at the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. The city also has a [[football (soccer)]] team in [[Toulouse FC]] and a [[rugby league]] team, [[Toulouse Olympique]], who has won the [[French rugby league championship|French championship]] on four occasions. The city also hosted games during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], and the [[EuroBasket 1999]].
