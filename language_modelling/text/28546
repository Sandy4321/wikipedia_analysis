The '''Battle of the Trench'''  (Arabic <U+063A><U+0632><U+0648><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062E><U+0646><U+062F><U+0642>), was a fortnight long siege of [[Medina]] (then called [[Yathrib]]) by Arab and Jewish confederates beginning on 31 March 627. The outnumbered defenders of [[Medina]], mainly Muslims and led by [[Muhammad]], opted to dig and fight from a trench rather than meeting the enemy in open. The trench in combination with Medina's natural fortifications rendered the confederate [[cavalry]] (consisting of horses and [[Camel cavalry|camels]]) useless, locking the two sides in stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the [[Banu Qurayza]] to attack the city from the south. However, [[Muhammad as a diplomat|Muhammad's diplomacy]] derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organized defenders, the sinking of confederate morale and poor weather conditions ended the siege in a [[fiasco]]. 

The siege was a "battle of wits", in which Muslims diplomatically overcame their opponents with very few casualties. Efforts to eliminate Muslims failed, and Islam became influential in the region. As a consequence, the Muslims besieged the Qurayza, and upon the latter's [[unconditional surrender]], all Qurayza men were killed, while all women and children were enslaved. The defeat also caused the Meccans to lose their trade and much of their prestige.<ref name =statesman/>

==Name==
The battle is named after the ''khandaq'' (Arabic <U+0627><U+0644><U+062E><U+0646><U+062F><U+0642>) that was dug by Muslims in preparation for the battle. The word ''khandaq'' is the Arabic form of the Persian word  ''kandah'' (meaning "it has been dug").  For this reason the word "trench" may be replaced with "ditch". It may also be referred to by its original Arabic name "khandaq".<ref name="Nomani368">Nomani, ''Sirat al-Nabi'', p. 368-370.</ref>

The battle is also referred to as the ''Battle of Confederates'' (Arabic <U+063A><U+0632><U+0648><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0627><U+062D><U+0632><U+0627><U+0628>). The term "confederates" (Arabic <U+0627><U+0644><U+0627><U+062D><U+0632><U+0627><U+0628>) is used by the [[Qur'an]] to denote the confederacy of pagans and Jews against Islam.<ref>[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], ''The Holy Quran'', p. 1235.</ref> The [[Qur'an]] chronicles this war in surah {{Quran-usc-range|33|9|32}}.

== Background ==

After their [[Hegira|expulsion from Mecca]], the Muslims fought the Meccan [[Quraysh]] at the [[Battle of Badr]] in 625, and at the [[Battle of Uhud]] in 626. Although the Muslims were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the [[Quraysh]] army of 1,000 at [[Badr]], where the latter had threatened to attack. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were certainly impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many confederacies against Muslims. Nevertheless, he was unable to prevent the Meccan one.<ref name="Watt35-6">Watt, ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 34-37.</ref>

As with the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army used unconventional methods against their opponents (at [[Battle of Badr|Badr]], the Muslims surrounded the wells, depriving their opponents of water; at the [[battle of Uhud]], Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench to render the enemy cavalry ineffective.<ref name ="Ramadan"/>

==The Confederates==
Early 627, the Jews of Banu Nadir met with the Arab Quraysh of Mecca. [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]], along with other leaders from [[Khaybar]], traveled to swear allegiance with [[Safwan]] at Mecca.<ref name = trenchLing/> 

The bulk of the Confederate armies were gathered by the pagan Quraysh of [[Mecca]], led by [[Abu Sufyan]], who fielded 4,000 foot soldiers, 300 horsemen, and 1,000-1,500 men on camels.<ref name = "halabi1"/> 

Banu Nadir began rousing up the nomads of Najd. They bribed the [[Banu Ghatafan]] with half their harvest.<ref name="Watt35-6"/><ref name="Nomani368"/> This contingent, the second largest, added a strength of about 2,000 men 300 horsemen led by [[Unaina bin Hasan Fazari]]. Bani Asad also agreed to join them led by Tuleha Asadi.<ref name = "halabi1">al-Halabi, ''Sirat-i-Halbiyyah'' (Vol. II, part 12), p. 19.</ref> From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though it would have been much larger had some of its leaders not been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.<ref name ="trenchLing">Lings, ''Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources'', p. 215-6.</ref> 

Other tribes included the [[Banu Murra]] with 400 men led by [[Hars bin Auf Murri]]; [[Banu Shuja]] with 700 men led by Sufyanbin Abdu-Shams. In total, the strength of the Confederate armies, though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated around 10,000.<ref name = "halabi1"/>

In accordance with the plan the armies began marching towards Medina, Meccans from the south (along the coast) and others from the east. At the same time horsemen from the Banu Khuza left to warn Medina of the invading army.<ref name = trenchLing/>

==Muslim defense==
The men from Banu Khuza'a reached [[Muhammad]] in four days, warning him of the Confederate armies that were to arrive in a week.<ref name = trenchLing/> Muhammad, as he did normally, gathered the people of Medina to discuss the best strategy of overcoming the enemy. Meeting the enemy in the open (which had led to the [[Battle of Badr|victory at Badr]]), and waiting for the enemy inside the city (a lesson learnt from the [[Battle of Uhud|defeat at Uhud]]) were both suggested.<ref name ="Ramadan"/> Ultimately the outnumbered Muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle by establishing deep trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front. The tactic of a defensive trench was introduced to the Arabs by [[Salman the Persian]], who acquired the knowledge in Persia. Traditional Muslim sources state that every capable Muslim (including [[Muhammad]]) in Medina contributed to digging the massive trench in twenty days.<ref>Ibn Hisham, p. 234.</ref> The ditch was dug on the northern side only, as the rest of Medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees, impenetrable to large armies (especially cavalry). The digging of the ditch coincided with a near-famine in Medina.  Women and children were moved to the inner parts of the city.<ref name="Nomani368"/> Further the Medinans harvested all their crops early, so the Confederate armies would have to rely on their own food reserves.<ref name ="Ramadan"/> 

Muhammad established headquarter at the hillock of Sala' and the army was arrayed there;<ref name="Nomani368"/> position would give Muslims an advantage if the enemy crossed the trench.<ref name="Watt35-6"/>

The final army that would defend the city from the invasion consisted of 3,000 men,<ref>al-Halabi, p. 27.</ref> and included all of the inhabitants of Medina over the of 15, except the Banu Qurayza (the Qurayzah did, however, supply Muslims with some instruments for digging the trench).<ref name="Watt35-6"/> Later 200 men were sent inside the city to guard the women and children, after an attack from Banu Qurayza was apprehended.<ref name="Nomani368"/>

==Siege of Medina==
[[Image:Trench.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Battle of Khandaq (Battle of the Trench)]]

Since sieges were uncommon in Arabian warfare, the arriving confederates were unprepared to deal with the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to hurl bodies of horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans entrenched rigidly prevented such a crossing.<ref name ="statesman">Watt, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman'', p. 168-174.</ref> Further, to deter the Confederate army from approaching, Muslims fired arrows and engaged in skirmishes.<ref name= al-ahzab>Al-Mubarakpuri, ''Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum'', {{what}}.</ref>

The Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock. A group of militants led by <U+2018>Amr bin <U+2018>Abd-e-Wudd and [[Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl]] attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to cross the trench occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr's challenge to the Muslims to a duel was accepted by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. After a short engagement, Ali killed 'Amr and the confederates were forced to withdraw in the state of panic and confusion.<ref name= al-ahzab/> Although the Confederates lost only two men during the encounter, they failed to accomplish anything important.<ref name =statesman/> 

The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the trench during the night and failed every time. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting.<ref name =statesman/> 

===Banu Qurayza===
Faced with this situation the Confederates tried to make several attacks at once, in particular by trying to persuade the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qurayza]] to attack the Muslims from the south.<ref name =statesman/> From the Confederates, [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]], a [[Khaybar]]ian, the leader of the exiled Jewish tribe [[Banu Nadir]], returned to Medina seeking their support against the Muslims.<ref name="Nomani382">Nomani, p. 382.</ref> So far the Qurayza had tried to remain neutral,<ref name="Watt35-6"/> and were initially hesitant to join the Confederates since they had earlier made a [[Constitution of Medina|pact]] with Muhammad.<ref name = "Maududi"/> When Akhtab approached them, their leader refused to allow him entry.<ref name = "huyayyLings">Lings, p. 221-223.</ref>

Akhtab eventually managed to enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed if they opened a second front against them,<ref name ="statesman"/> and tore into pieces the agreement between the Qurayza and Muhammad.<ref name="Kurayza">Watt, "Kurayza, Banu" ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''.</ref> The sight of the Confederate armies, surging the land with soldiers and horses as far as the eye could see, swung the opinion in the favour of the Confederacy.<ref name ="huyayyLings"/> 

News of Qurayzah's one-sided renounciation of their pact with Muhammad leaked, and [[Umar]] promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were re-enforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza.<ref name ="Ramadan">Ramadan, ''In the Footsteps of the Prophet'', p. 137-145.</ref><ref name ="huyayyLings"/> [[Muhammad]] became anxious about their conduct,<ref name="Kurayza"/> and realized the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his [[Constitution of Medina|pact]] with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe.<ref name = "Maududi"/> The Qurayza also possessed large numbers of weaponry: 1,500 [[sword]]s, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armor, and 500 shields.<ref name="Heck">Heck, "Arabia Without Spices: An Alternate Hypothesis", p. 547-567.</ref> 

Muhammad sent three [[sahaba|leading Muslims]] to bring him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Qurayza to be loyal, so as to increase the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the [[Constitution of Medina|pact]] on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.<ref name ="huyayyLings"/><ref name = "Maududi"/> 

The leaders found that the pact indeed had been renounced, and tried in vain of convincing the Qurayza to revert by reminding them of the fates of [[Banu Nadir#Expulsion from Medina|Banu Nadir]] and [[Banu Qaynuqa#Expulsion|Banu Qaynuqa]].<ref name ="huyayyLings"/> The findings of the leaders were signaled to Muhammad in a metaphor: "''Adal and Qarah''". Because the people of [[Adal and Qarah]] had betrayed the Muslims and killed them at the opportune moment, Maududi believes the metaphor means the Qurayza intended to do the same.<ref name = "Maududi">Maududi, ''The Meaning of the Quran'', p. 64f.</ref>

===Crisis in Medina===

Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Qurayza; however, rumor soon spread of a massive assault on the city of Medina from Qurayza's side designed to capture the defenders' families which severely demoralized the Medinans.<ref name = pete>Peterson, ''Muhammad. Prophet of God'', p. 123f.</ref>

Muslims found themselves in greater difficulties by the day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/> So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship.<ref name = pete/>

===Muslim response===
Immediately after hearing the news of the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for protection. Later he sent 300 horsemen (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city.<ref name ="Ramadan"/> The loud voices, in which the troops glorified God every night, created the illusion of a large force.<ref name ="huyayyLings"/>

The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent a word to Ghatafan trying to negotiate their defection, offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement,<ref name ="ghatafanLings">Lings, p. 224-226.</ref> protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering negotiations with Medina, and Confederacy's internal dissension had increased.<ref name =statesman/>

At about that point, Muhammad received a visit from Nuaym ibn Masud, an Arab leader well respected by the entire confederacy, but who had secretly converted to Islam. Muhammad asked him to end the siege by creating discord amongst Confederates. When Nuaym asked permission to lie, Muhammad replied "Say what thou wilt to draw them off of us - war is deception."<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/><ref name ="Ramadan"/> Watt comments: "The whole was a battle of wits in which Muslims had the best of it; without cost to themselves they weakened the enemy and increased the dissension."<ref name = statesman/>

Nuaym then came up with an efficient stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched the fears the Qurayza had harbored.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/><ref name ="Ramadan"/>

Next Nuaym went to [[Abu Sufyan]], the Confederate leader, warning him that the Qurayza had defected to Muhammad. He stated that the Jewish tribe intended to ask the Confederacy of hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to handover to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/><ref name ="Ramadan"/>

===Collapse of the Confederacy===
Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent [[Ikrimah]] to the Qurayza, signaling a united invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as a guarantee that the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent back and forth between the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/><ref name ="Ramadan"/>

[[Abu Sufyan]] summoned [[Huyayy ibn Akhtab]], informing him of Qurayza's response. Huyayy was  taken aback, and Abu Sufyan branded him as a "traitor". Fearing for his life, Huyayy fled to the Qurayza's strongholds.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/><ref name ="Ramadan"/>

The Bedouins, the Ghatafan and other Confederates from Najd had already been compromised by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than any particular prejudice against Islam. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.<ref name ="ghatafanLings"/>

The provisions of the Confederate armies were running out. Horses and camels were dying out of hunger and wounds. For days the weather had been exceptionally cold and wet. Violent winds blew out the camp fires, taking away from the Confederate army their source of heat. The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered by such winds. During the night the Confederate armies withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.<ref>Lings, p. 227-228.</ref>

==Aftermath: Siege of the Banu Qurayza==
{{main|Banu Qurayza}}

Following the battle, the Muslims besieged the [[Banu Qurayza]], whom they accused of [[treason]] during the battle. After a 25 days, the Banu Qurayza surrendered unconditionally. On the request of the Aws, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to decide the Qurayza's fate. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decided the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the decision was executed.<ref name ="statesman"/>

==Implications==
The failure of the siege marked the beginning of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina.<ref name =statesman2>Watt, ''Muhammad: Prophet and statesman'', p. 96.</ref> The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this  defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.<ref name =statesman/> From the magnitude of the defeated army, it had become clear that the Arab military forces regardless of size would not be able to exterminate Islam.<ref name= al-ahzab/>
