'''''Justice''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought]] [[battleship]] of the [[Libert<U+00E9> class battleship|''Libert<U+00E9>'' class]] built by the [[French Navy]]. She had three [[sister ship]]s: [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']], [[French battleship V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>|''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'']], and [[French battleship D<U+00E9>mocratie|''D<U+00E9>mocratie'']]. ''Justice'' was laid down in April 1903, launched in October 1904, and completed in February 1908, over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} made ships like ''Justice'' obsolete. She was armed with a main battery of four {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} guns, compared to the ten guns of the same caliber mounted on ''Dreadnought''.

After her commissioning, ''Justice'' was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. In September 1909, she traveled to the United States for the  [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]]. At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, she was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first days of the war, and spent the rest based at [[Corfu]] and [[Mudros]] without seeing any action. After the war ended, she participated in the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]], though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet's withdrawal. ''Justice'' was sold for scrapping in 1922.

''Justice'' was laid down at the [[Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e|La Seyne shipyard]] in [[Toulon]] in April 1903, launched on 27 October 1904, and completed in February 1908,<ref name=G297>Gardiner, p. 297</ref> over a year after the revolutionary British battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, which rendered the [[pre-dreadnought]]s like ''Justice'' outdated before they were completed.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 21</ref> The ship was {{convert|133.81|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length between perpendiculars|long between perpendiculars]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|24.26|m|abbr=on|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|8.41|m|abbr=on|ftin}}. She displaced up to {{convert|14860|MT|sp=us}} at full load. ''Justice'' had a crew of between 739 and 769 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by three vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s with twenty-four [[Niclausse boiler]]s. They were rated at {{convert|18500|ihp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}. Coal storage amounted to {{convert|1800|MT|abbr=on}}.<ref name=G297/>

''Justice''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893/96 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of ten [[Canon de 194 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1902]] guns; six were mounted in single turrets, and four in [[casemate]]s in the hull. She also carried thirteen 9-pounder guns and ten 3-pounders. The ship was also armed with two {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s submerged in the hull. The ship's [[belt armor|main belt]] was {{convert|280|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|350|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|305|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides.<ref name=G297/>

==Service history==
In September 1909, ''Justice'', [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']], and [[French battleship V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>|''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'']] visited the United States for the [[Hudson-Fulton Celebration]]. The three battleships, commanded by Admiral Jules le Pord, were the first foreign contingent to arrive.<ref>Levine & Panetta, p. 51</ref> The ships departed from [[Brest, France|Brest]] and arrived New York seven days later, having run at an average of {{convert|16|kn}}; the performance of the ships' propulsion systems was regarded as satisfactory by contemporary naval experts, including the [[United States Naval Institute]].<ref>Alger, p. 1415</ref> In early 1911, the French Navy conducted experiments with [[wireless telegraphy]], and used ''V<U+00E9>rit<U+00E9>'' and ''Justice'' for the tests. The wireless transmitters could pick up messages as far as {{convert|72|mi}} away.<ref>Alger, p. 283</ref> On 11 October 1911, an accidental fire aboard ''Justice'' threatened to destroy the ship in a way similar to the explosion that destroyed her [[sister ship]] [[French battleship Libert<U+00E9>|''Libert<U+00E9>'']] the month before. The fire was believed to have been started by a short circuit in the electrical system near the forward [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. The  fire nearly reached the ammunition in the magazines when the ship's commander ordered the magazines to be flooded, averting a catastrophic explosion. This occurred just days after the battleship [[French battleship Suffren|''Suffren'']] had to flood her magazines to put out another accidental fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9803EFDF1231E233A25754C2A9669D946096D6CF|title=Fire On French Battleship|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 October 1911|accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> Later that year, the ship was featured in the film ''A Day on the French battleship "Justice"''.<ref>Munden, p. 271</ref>

At the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, ''Justice'' was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], along with [[French battleship D<U+00E9>mocratie|''D<U+00E9>mocratie'']].<ref>Guernsey, p. 180</ref> The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops&mdash;the [[19th Army Corps (France)|XIX Corps]]&mdash;from Algeria to metropolitan France. As a result, the fleet was far out of position to catch the German [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Goeben}}.<ref>Halpern (1995), pp. 55&ndash;56</ref> For the majority of the war, the French used their main fleet to keep the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Austro-Hungarian fleet]] bottled up in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In 1914 she participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]], where the [[line of battle|battle line]] caught the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}} by surprise and sank her. The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at [[Kotor|Cattaro]] in an attempt to draw out the Austro-Hungarian fleet, which refused to take the bait.<ref>Halpern (2004), p. 4</ref>

The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to [[Malta]], but it was hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several [[submarine]]s, one of which torpedoed the [[dreadnought]] [[French battleship Jean Bart (1911)|''Jean Bart'']] in December 1914. The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic.<ref>Halpern (2004), pp. 3&ndash;4</ref> As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] as their primary naval base in the area.<ref>Halpern (2004), p. 16</ref> Later in the war, ''Justice'' was sent to [[Mudros]] along with her sister ships.<ref>Preston, p. 29</ref>

In 1919, after the end of the war, ''Justice'' participated in the French naval [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]] in the [[Black Sea]], and was based in [[Sevastopol]]. On 19 April, a [[mutiny]] gripped the French fleet, starting on the battleship [[French battleship France|''France'']], the squadron [[flagship]]. At one point during the mutiny, the crew of ''Justice'' briefly flew the [[red flag]], though they remained relatively calm. The situation worsened after a group of Greek soldiers fired into a crowd of demonstrators ashore; one French sailor was killed and another five were injured. ''Justice''{{'}}s crew was enraged, and began discussing opening fire on the Greek battleship [[Greek battleship Kilkis|''Kilkis'']], moored nearby. ''Justice''{{'}}s captain ordered his ship's guns disabled by removing their [[Breechblock|breech blocks]] to prevent an attack. The situation was eventually defused by returning the French squadron back to France, one of the mutineers' primary demands.<ref>Bell & Elleman, pp. 88&ndash;91</ref> Ultimately, ''Justice'' was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrap.<ref name=battleship>Jackson, pg 153</ref>
