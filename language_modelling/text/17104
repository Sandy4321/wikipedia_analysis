'''Allen Cunningham''' (born [[March 28]] [[1977]]) is an [[United States|American]] professional [[poker]] player. Cunningham studied [[civil engineering]] at [[UCLA]] before dropping out of school to play poker professionally.  He began playing at 18 in Indian casinos. Cunningham plays online poker exclusively at [[Full Tilt Poker]]. Previously a Full Tilt sponsored pro, he became a full member of Team Full Tilt in October 2006. Cunningham earned the title 2005 ESPN/Toyota Player of the Year and came close to winning it again in 2006.  He was also voted by fellow professional poker players the Best All Around Player under 35. Cunningham's single largest tournament payout occurred at the [[2006 World Series of Poker]] when he finished in fourth place in the Main Event earning $3,628,513. Frequently during the tournament, when other players tried to take on Cunningham, [[ESPN]]'s [[Norman Chad]] would respond with comments such as: "What are they thinking of? This is ''Allen Cunningham''!" Cunningham joined a short list of players who have won a World Series of Poker Bracelet in three consecutive years after winning his fifth bracelet in [[2007 World Series of Poker|2007]].  Others to accomplish this include [[Johnny Moss]], [[Bill Boyd]], [[Doyle Brunson]], [[Gary Berland]] and [[Erik Seidel]].

Cunningham won the $300,000 'Mega Match' on [[Poker After Dark]] that aired the week of October 8, 2007.
