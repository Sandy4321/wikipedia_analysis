[[File:Day5pressureforecast.gif|thumb|right|250 px|Forecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the north Pacific, North America, and north Atlantic ocean.]]'''Weather forecasting''' is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative [[data]] about the current state of the atmosphere on a given place and using [[meteorology|scientific understanding of atmospheric processes]] to project how the atmosphere will evolve on that place.

Once an all-human endeavor based mainly upon changes in [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]], current weather conditions, and sky condition, weather forecasting now relies on [[numerical weather prediction|computer-based models]] that take many atmospheric factors into account. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, [[teleconnection]]s, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The [[chaos theory|chaotic]] nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the ''range'' of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.

There are a variety of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on [[temperature]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] are important to [[agriculture]], and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the [[wind chill]], forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.

== History ==

===Ancient forecasting===
For millennia people have tried to forecast the weather. In 650&nbsp;BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns predicted the weather from cloud patterns as well as [[astrology]]. In about 340&nbsp;BC, [[Aristotle]] described weather patterns in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorologica]]''.<ref>[http://yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1994/5/94.05.01.x.html Meteorology by Lisa Alter]</ref> Later, [[Theophrastus]] compiled a book on weather forecasting, called the ''Book of Signs''.<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/cig/weather/forecasting-from-beginning.html Weather: Forecasting from the Beginning]</ref> [[China|Chinese]] weather prediction lore extends at least as far back as 300&nbsp;BC,<ref>[[University of California]] Museum of Paleontology. [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/aristotle.html Aristotle (384-322&nbsp;B.C.E.).] Retrieved on 2008-01-12.</ref> which was also around the same time ancient [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomers]] developed weather-prediction methods.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE INDIAN AND PSEUDO-INDIAN PASSAGES IN GREEK AND LATIN ASTRONOMICAL AND ASTROLOGICAL TEXTS|author=[[David Pingree]]|pages=141<U+2013>195 [143<U+2013>4]|url=http://brepols.metapress.com/content/6861608670636388/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=2010-03-01|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Ancient weather forecasting methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, it might be observed that if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce [[weather lore]]. However, not all of these predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.<ref>Jerry Wilson.

The two men credited with the birth of forecasting as a science were officer of the [[Royal Navy]] [[Francis Beaufort]] and his [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] [[Robert FitzRoy]]. Both were influential men in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] naval and governmental circles, and though ridiculed in the press at the time, their work gained scientific credence, was accepted by the [[Royal Navy]], and formed the basis for all of today's weather forecasting knowledge.<ref>{{cite web| author = Eric D.

Beaufort developed the [[Beaufort scale|Wind Force Scale]] and Weather Notation coding, which he was to use in his journals for the remainder of his life. He also promoted the development of reliable tide tables around British shores, and with his friend [[William Whewell]], expanded weather record-keeping at 200 British [[Coast guard]] stations.

Robert FitzRoy was appointed in 1854 as chief of a new department within the [[Board of Trade]] to deal with the collection of weather data at sea as a service to [[sailor|mariners]]. This was the forerunner of the modern [[Met Office|Meteorological Office]]. All ship captains were tasked with collating data on the weather and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.<ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968">Mellersh, H. E. L. (1968). FitzRoy of the Beagle. Hart-Davis. ISBN 0-246-97452-4</ref>

[[File:Meyers b16 s0570.jpg|left|thumb|Weather map of Europe, 10 December 1887.]]
A terrible storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']] inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made, which he called ''"forecasting the weather"'', thus coining the term "weather forecast".<ref name="Mellersh, H. E. L. 1968"/> Fifteen land stations were established to use the new [[telegraph]] to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times leading to the first gale warning service. His warning service for shipping was initiated in February 1861, with the use of [[electric telegraph|telegraph communications]]. In the following year a system was introduced of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected.<ref name="Kington">{{Cite book|title=Climates of the British Isles: Present, Past and Future|first=John|last=Kington|editor=Mike Hulme and Elaine Barrow|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=147}}</ref> The ''"Weather Book"''  which FitzRoy published in 1863 was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time.

The electric telegraph network became denser in the 1870s, allowing for the more rapid dissemination of warnings; this also led to the development of an observational network which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. To convey accurate information, it soon became necessary to have a standard vocabulary describing clouds; this was achieved by means of a series of classifications first achieved by [[Luke Howard]] in 1802, and standardized in the ''[[International Cloud Atlas]]'' of 1896.

===Numerical prediction===
{{Main|History of numerical weather prediction}}
It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern [[numerical weather prediction]]. In 1922, English scientist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process",<ref>Richardson, Lewis Fry, ''Weather Prediction by Numerical Process'' (Cambridge, England:  Cambridge University Press, 1922).  Available on-line at:  [http://archive.org/stream/weatherpredictio00richrich#page/n7/mode/2up Internet Archive.org].</ref> after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I. He described therein how small terms in the prognostic fluid dynamics equations governing atmospheric flow could be neglected, and a finite differencing scheme in time and space could be devised, to allow numerical prediction solutions to be found.

Richardson envisioned a large auditorium of thousands of people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, and the size of the grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to [[numerical instability]].<ref>Lynch, P. (2006). The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction. Cambridge U.P.</ref> The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team led by the mathematician [[John von Neumann]]; von Neumann publishing the paper ''Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation'' in 1950.<ref>Charney, Fj<U+00F6>rtoft and von Neumann, 1950, Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation

{{Main|Numerical weather prediction}}

The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.  The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated [[weather station]]s at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea. The [[World Meteorological Organization]] acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide.

Models are ''initialized'' using this observed data.  The irregularly spaced observations are processed by [[data assimilation]] and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid).  The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast.<ref>[[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] (2007-08-14). [http://web.archive.org/web/20070814044336/http://www.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/WG4/wrfvar/wrfvar-tutorial.htm The WRF Variational Data Assimilation System (WRF-Var).] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref> Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called [[primitive equations]].  These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined.  The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future.  The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future.  This ''time stepping'' procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.  The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.  Time steps for [[global climate model]]s may be on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models may be a few seconds to a few minutes.

Essentially, a model is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes.

This guidance is presented in coded numerical form, and can be obtained for nearly all National Weather Service reporting stations in the United States. As proposed by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1963, long range forecasts, those made at a range of two weeks or more, are impossible to definitively predict the state of the atmosphere, owing to the [[chaos theory|chaotic nature]] of the [[fluid dynamics]] equations involved.  In numerical models, extremely small errors in initial values double roughly every five days for variables such as temperature and wind velocity.<ref>{{cite book|title=Storm Watchers|pages=222<U+2013>224|year=2002|author=Cox, John D.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|isbn=0-471-38108-X}}</ref>

==Techniques==

===Persistence===
The simplest method of forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This can be a valid way of forecasting the weather when it is in a steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and [[Long range weather forecasts|long range forecasts]].<ref>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. [http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fcst/mth/prst.rxml Persistence Forecasting:  Today equals Tomorrow.] Retrieved on 2007-02-16.</ref>

===Use of a barometer===
Measurements of barometric pressure and the pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) have been used in forecasting since the late 19th century.<ref>[[USA Today]]. [http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wbarocx.htm Understanding air pressure.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref> The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than {{convert|3.5|hPa|mmHg|lk=on|abbr=on}}, the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a [[Low pressure area|low pressure system]] is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. [[High pressure area|Rapid pressure rises]] are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.<ref>Weather Doctor. [http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/eyes/barometer3.htm Applying The Barometer To Weather Watching.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref>

===Looking at the sky===
[[File:marestail.jpg|frame|right|Marestail shows moisture at high altitude, signalling the later arrival of wet weather.]]
Along with pressure tendency, the condition of the sky is one of the more important parameters used to forecast weather in mountainous areas. Thickening of cloud cover or the invasion of a higher cloud deck is indicative of rain in the near future.  At night, high thin [[cirrostratus cloud]]s can lead to [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]]s around the [[moon]], which indicates an approach of a [[warm front]] and its associated [[rain]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KtkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA148&dq=halo+use+in+weather+forecasting+book#v=onepage&q=halo%20use%20in%20weather%20forecasting%20book&f=false|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|page=148|title=Make Your Own Weather Forecasts|author=Dennis Eskow|date=March 1983|accessdate=2011-04-02|volume=159|issue=3}}</ref>  Morning [[fog]] portends fair conditions, as rainy conditions are preceded by wind or clouds which prevent fog formation. The approach of a line of [[thunderstorm]]s could indicate the approach of a [[cold front]]. Cloud-free skies are indicative of fair weather for the near future.<ref>Mark Moore (2009-03-25).

[http://wilstar.com/skywatch.htm#indicators Skywatch: Signs of the Weather.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref>

===Nowcasting===<!-- link target-->
''The term nowcasting is also used in [[nowcasting (economics)|economics]].''

The forecasting of the weather within the next six hours is often referred to as '''nowcasting'''.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&query=nowcast&submit=Search Nowcast.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref> In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours.<ref>E-notes.com. [http://www.enotes.com/science-fact-finder/weather-climate/what-nowcasting Weather and Climate | What Is Nowcasting?] Retrieved on 2011-09-08.</ref>

===Use of forecast models===
[[File:NAM 500 MB.PNG|right|250px|thumb|An example of 500 [[millibar|mbar]] [[geopotential height]] prediction from a numerical weather prediction model]]

In the past, the human forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations.<ref>[[NASA]]. [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/WxForecasting/wx2.html Weather Forecasting Through the Ages.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref> Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance.<ref name="Klaus">Klaus Weickmann, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith (2001-12-01).

===Analog technique===
The analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event which is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future.<ref>[http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/fcst/mth/oth.rxml Other Forecasting Methods:  climatology, analogue and numerical weather prediction.] Retrieved on 2006-02-16.</ref> Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition.

==Communicating forecasts to the public==
[[File:Newspaper weather forecast - today and tomorrow.svg|frame|thumb|right|An example of a two-day weather forecast in the [[Visual language|visual style]] that an American newspaper might use. Temperatures are given in Fahrenheit.]]
Most end users of forecasts are members of the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous [[lightning]] strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages,<ref>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. [http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/dngr/light.rxml Lightning.] Retrieved on 2007-02-16.</ref> and widespread hail damage.

Several countries employ government agencies to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories to the public in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests. Knowledge of what the end user needs from a weather forecast must be taken into account to present the information in a useful and understandable way. Examples include the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]'s [[National Weather Service]] (NWS)<ref>National Weather Service. [http://www.nws.noaa.gov/admin.php About NOAA's National Weather Service.] Retrieved on 2007-02-16.</ref> and [[Environment Canada]]'s [[Meteorological Service of Canada|Meteorological Service]] (MSC).<ref>Environment Canada. [http://www.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/canada_e.html Main website.] Retrieved on 2007-02-16.</ref> Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found.<ref>Canadian Heritage.

===Severe weather alerts and advisories===
A major part of modern weather forecasting is the severe weather alerts and advisories which the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property.<ref>[[National Weather Service]]. [http://www.weather.gov/mission.shtml National Weather Service Mission Statement.] Retrieved on 2008-05-25.</ref> Some of the most commonly known of severe weather advisories are the [[Severe thunderstorm warning|severe thunderstorm]] and [[tornado warning]], as well as the [[Severe thunderstorm watch|severe thunderstorm]] and [[tornado watch]].

=== Forestry ===

Weather forecasting of wind, precipitations and humidity is essential for preventing and controlling [[wildfire]]s. Different indices, like the ''[[Forest fire weather index]]'' and the ''[[Haines Index]]'', have been developed to predict the areas more at risk to experience fire from natural or human causes. Conditions for the development of harmful insects can be predicted by forecasting the evolution of weather, too.

===Utility companies===

{{Main|Degree day}}
Electricity and gas companies rely on weather forecasts to anticipate demand which can be strongly affected by the weather. They use the quantity termed the degree day to determine how strong of a use there will be for heating ([[heating degree day]]) or cooling (cooling degree day). These quantities are based on a daily average temperature of {{convert|65|F|C}}.
