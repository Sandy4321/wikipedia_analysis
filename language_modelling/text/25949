The '''1980 Amherst, Massachusetts water shortage''' was a water crisis in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] that amongst other things, closed the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] for three days.

==Background==
The summer of 1980 was a dry summer for much of the state of [[Massachusetts]]. After weeks of drought, the town's reservoirs were well below their normal levels. Precipitation totals since the beginning of July had been half of what they usually were and temperatures were higher than normal. The Atkins Reservoir in nearby [[Shutesbury, Massachusetts|Shutesbury]] was six feel below normal while the Hills Reservoir in nearby [[Pelham, Massachusetts|Pelham]] was thirteen feet below normal and its output was reduced by half. A third reservoir in the same town was two and a half feet below normal levels.<ref name="Tappedout">{{cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/loop/lookingback/articles/20732.php|title=Tapped out: 1980 water crisis forced campus evacuation|author=Fitzgibbons, Daniel J.|publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]|date=9 September 2005|accessdate=8 August 2011}}</ref>

On August 31st, the campus reopened and students from all over began returning to school. [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] weekend brought more challenges to the system as temperatures climbed into the 80s and demand for water by Labor Day soared to 4.5 million gallons, 700,000 more than the previous record.<ref name="Tappedout" />

By Tuesday, Amherst Town Manager Louis Hayward had a dilemma. Construction of a new well in the Lawrence Swamp in [[South Amherst, Massachusetts|South Amherst]] was at least four weeks away. As a result, the Board of Selectmen authorized Hayward to declare a water emergency starting the following Monday. This emergency order was supposed to cut water usage by twenty five percent by banning all agricultural irrigation, watering of lawns, and the washing of cars. Selectmen were also authorized to purchase water from neighboring [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]]. Campus officials were also put on a state of alert and told to try to cut back consumption. Interestingly, campus officials two years earlier had posted notices advising students with tips on how to conserve water. That same morning, local fire department notified the department of public works that alarms in the town's four storage tanks had shown that water levels had dropped to forty feet, well below the normal of 62 feet. Officials responded by increasing the levels of water being pumped into the tanks.<ref name="Tappedout" />

The first signs of trouble came the next morning when a resident of [[William M. Cashin House]] on the northern end of campus called the school's maintenance to report low water levels. A plumber was dispatched and after checking that the filters weren't clogged, determined it was a supply problem. A call was placed into the local water department. By early afternoon, signs were posted in the dorm advising students on the fifth through eighth floors that there was no water available. Complaints began to trickle in from the Sylvan, Orchard Hill, and Central Residential Areas. All these dorms were on a hill relative to the rest of campus. Health services then went out to local markets and bought distilled water and secured two 55 gallon drums from a [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]] company.<ref name="Tappedout" />

Eventually, plumbers were dispatched to shut off water to first the individual floors, then entire buildings. By six that night, the Physical Plant director alerted Vice Chancellor for Administration and Finance George Beatty about the impending crisis. Around forty five minutes later, the town manager was notified of the problem. Around this time, water shortages were beginning to be noticed in the Southwest Residential Area. In the [[Mildred Pierpont House]], toilets wouldn<U+2019>t stop flushing, a consequence of low water pressure. By 9:30 that night, about 3,000 students were without water. Chancellor Henry Koffler returned from meetings in Boston and was subsequently warned by Beatty that if the pressure continued to drop, the steam plant would have to be shut down, and research projects, air conditioning, and electrical systems would also have to be turned off. All of this would prove costly. By this time,  students were travelling to Puffers Pond in [[North Amherst, Massachusetts|North Amherst]] to clean up. The chancellor was also urged by Hayward to close the campus.<ref name="Tappedout" />

In a last ditch effort an hour and a half later, water was ordered shut off to the Southwest Residential Area, which contained 5,600 residents at the time. Water service to the [[John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center]], Tobin and Herter halls as well as the showers at the Boyden Gym were also shut off. Reports from the night state that some students hoarded water in pails before the taps were shut off. By four the next morning, it was determined that the shutdown of water to the area had no affect and so service was restored. As a result of people leaving the faucets on, the bathrooms flooded when service was restored.<ref name="Tappedout" />

==Shutdown and evacuation==
At 7:30 that morning, the Chancellor Henry Koffler convened a meeting and reluctantly announced plans to shut down the campus. At ten, campus representatives were informed of the plan with the only business going on at the school <U+201C>urgent business<U+201D>. Additionally, air conditioning would no longer  run at the school. By noon, campus would close and according to notices sent to residence halls, <U+201C>All students are to leave Amherst as quickly as possible. Only the most difficult cases are to be allowed as exceptions.<U+201D><ref name="Tappedout" />

As a result of the campus now being closed, the town of Amherst activated an emergency well on Bay Road in South Amherst as well as beginning to tap into Hadley<U+2019>s water system. Officials were briefly encouraged when tank levels rose from zero to twenty-one feet by nine that morning, but two hours later levels began to drop again. As a result of the low water pressure, firefighters began taking a 1,000 gallon tanker truck with them on calls.<ref name="Tappedout" />

The mass evacuation of people called for an armada of transportation to suit the needs of students. As a result of this, officials arranged for an armada of busses to take students to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], and [[Boston]] beginning at two that afternoon. Calls were soon received from people as far away as [[Enfield, Connecticut]] offering to house the temporarily displaced students. The chancellor even offered to house students until he realized that his house, perched on the side of Orchard Hill, was also without water. Eventually, the school<U+2019>s transit service set up tables in the Southwest, Sylvan, and Central residential areas to sell bus tickets to the students. The resulting scene was later described as a <U+201C>madhouse<U+201D> by a ticket seller. People who were unable to pay were told that if they supplied their student number, they would be billed later. A total of fifty-five busses were used that day.<ref name="Tappedout" />

The mood of the remaining students began to turn festive as a result of them not being affected by water shortages. According to the ''[[The Daily Collegian (Massachusetts)|The Daily Collegian]]'', the campus newspaper, several fraternity and sorority organizations began to plan <U+201C>shower parties<U+201D>, which involved a lot of beer. According to the [[Boston Globe]], two liquor stores in town reported brisk sales to students. By late afternoon, the campus was largely deserted of the 11,000 students that had lived there.<ref name="Tappedout" />

==Response==
Governor [[Edward King]], who was visiting [[Tri-County Fair|a fair]] in nearby [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] instructed the [[Massachusetts State Police|state police]] to patrol the campus to deter looters. The campus also promised to beef up police presence. As the campus remained in 24-hour lockdown, only 600 students remained on campus, including 600 international students in [[Walter E. Prince Hall]], and 360 residential assistants. Some student athletes also remained behind. The [[Massachusetts National Guard|national guard]] also brought in eight tanks of water and purchased hundreds of empty cider jugs from a local farm. The dining commons also switched to paper plates and plastic utensils and water was shut off to the dorms by the Physical Plant.<ref name="Tappedout" />

==Return to normalcy==
Soon after, the town began to refill its tanks and bring new supplies online. Campus officials began to plan to have students back on campus on Sunday. Inevitably, a blame game ensued between town and campus officials, but eventually this settled down as focus shifted on bringing students back. Students were also reimbursed for room and dining commons. Depending on their meal plan, students were reimbursed between $22.89 and $26.76. A plan by the president of the Student Government Association to charter fifteen busses was turned down. Bathrooms were also cleaned and disinfected to allow for students to come back and an extension of the add-drop deadline was announced. One entrepreneuing student who stayed behind began to hawk <U+201C>UMass Evacuation<U+201D> T-shirts, which showed a dripping faucet labeled <U+201C>Amherst DPW<U+201D>. All one hundred and sixty-eight shirts were sold within two hours.<ref name="Tappedout" />
