The '''''Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Police Department''''', or '''''TBTA Police''''' is a law enforcement agency in [[New York City]] whose duties are to protect all facilities and surrounding area operated by the [[Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority]] (TBTA) and to enforce all state and city laws at all the facilities and the surrounding area plus many non law enforcement duties, including collecting the tolls (toll collection being phased out to MTA Bridge & Tunnel toll collectors), assisting vehicles stuck in [[E-Z Pass]] lanes, operating tow trucks to clear disabled vehicles and clearing snow from the roadways at all the facilities. The TBTA Police is one of the largest police departments in New York City, with approximately 900 Bridge and Tunnel officers (BTO's) currently employed by the department. The TBTA Police is run out of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is a division of the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]].

== Facilities ==
Currently, the TBTA Police have BTO's at all facilities operated by the TBTA. 

The facilities are:

*[[Triborough Bridge]]
*[[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge]]
*[[Verrazano Narrows Bridge]]
*[[Throgs Neck Bridge]]
*[[Henry Hudson Bridge]]
*[[Marine Parkway-Gil Hodges Memorial Bridge]]
*[[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]]
*[[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]]
*[[Queens Midtown Tunnel]]

== Authority ==
BTO's are [[New York State]] [[Peace Officer]]s authorized to make [[Warrant (law)|warrantless]] [[arrest]]s, make [[Traffic stop|car stops]], issue [[Summons#Citation|summonses]], and carry [[firearm]]s. BTO's have Peace Officer status throughout the entire state of New York.

== Units ==
Currently, the TBTA Police has the following units:

*Patrol
*Highway Patrol
*Special Operations Division/Collision Reduction Unit
*Recruit Training (Academy Instructors)
*Ceremonial Unit

There is also a police combat shooting team.

== Operations ==
Typical patrol posts are foot posts/security posts at anchorages, vent buildings, plaza, and lane patrol. 

CORT/SP Radio Car Patrols - These posts patrol facilities, the surrounding area, anchorages, vent buildings, and any property owned by the TBTA. The main focus of these patrols are to answer 911 calls, enforce VTL & NYC Traffic rules and regulations, assist motorists, and disabled vehicles, prevent and respond to crimes in the past and in progress, and prevent acts of terrorism.

Sector Posts - RMP(police car) security posts to prevent tresspassing on private property, entering closed lanes or levels, and preventing vandalism or other crimes.

Checkpoints - Conduct truck/vehicle checkpoints on or at the entrance of facilities to prevent any crimes from occurring.

Highway Patrol/SOD - Highway patrol's main focus is the safety of the motoring public and speed enforcement. Speed is enforced through the use of Radar/Lidar equipment, and officers assigned are trained through local police agencies in the use of such equipment.

== Toll Collection and Non Law Enforcement Duties ==
Currently BTO's only collect tolls when the facility is short of temporary toll collectors (hired on a 1 year basis, usually rehired at completion of 1 year). Temporary toll collectors have no law enforcement status and their sole responsiblity is the collection of tolls.[http://www.mta.info/bandt/employ/tbtonew.htm]

BTO's operate wreckers to remove disabled vehicles from the roadways and also peform firefighting and emergency rescue operations at the scene of an accident or fire.
During snow storms BTO's may be required to assist in the removal of snow off the roadways.

== Training ==
BTO's attend the MTA Bridges and Tunnels [[Police academy|Training Academy]] located on [[Randalls Island]], NY.
BTO's receive training in accordance with the New York State Municipal Police Training Council standards, New York City Fire Department training,  NIMS training, Recognizing and Dealing with Weapons of Mass Destruction training, Radiation Detector training,  American Red Cross First Aid/CPR training and MTA Bridges & Tunnels Training Academy.

== Vehicles ==
Currently the department uses [[9C1]] police package [[Chevrolet Impala#Police_Package|Chevrolet Impala]]s for patrol and [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]s and [[Chevrolet Suburban]]s for Highway Patrol/SOD.[http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/491718803_219c5152ce.jpg] [http://transitport.50webs.com/tbta.html] The department terms their [[police cars]] "RMP"s, which stands for Radio Motor Patrol.

== Recent incidents involving BTO's ==
In [[2007]], BTO's were involved in two shootings, on the Triborough and Bronx Whitestone Bridges, and assisted in the delivery of a newborn baby. 

On [[July 4]]th a man wanted for threatening the lives of two Washington DC police officers and for an outstanding felony warrant in New York was arrested by a BTO at the Triborough bridge on 125th street in Manhattan.[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2008/07/04/2008-07-04_triborough_bridge_walk_takes_toll_on_fug.html]

== Possible merger into Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police ==
There has been discussion around dissolving the TBTA Police and incorporating BTO's into the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority Police]] since both are ultimately part of the same agency, but this has not yet occurred.
