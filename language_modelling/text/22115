The '''Mascarene Parrot''' or '''Mascarin''' (''Mascarinus mascarinus'') is an [[extinct]] species of [[parrot]] that was [[endemic]] to the [[Mascarene island]] of [[R<U+00E9>union]] in the western [[Indian Ocean]]. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] relationships of this species has been subject to debate. It has been connected to the [[Psittaculini]] parrots based on anatomical grounds, but to the [[vasa parrot]]s based on genetic grounds. The exact placement is unresolved.

The Mascarene Parrot was 35&nbsp;cm (14&nbsp;in) in length with a large red [[Beak|bill]] and long, rounded [[Flight feather|tail feathers]]. Its legs were red, and it had naked red skin around the eyes and nostrils. It had a black facial mask and partially white tail feathers, but the colouration of the body, wings and head is unclear. Descriptions from life indicate the body and head were ash grey, and the white part of the tail had two dark central feathers. In contrast, descriptions based on stuffed specimens state that the body was brown and the head bluish but do not mention the dark central tail feathers. This may be due to the specimens having changed colour as a result of aging and exposure to light, as well as other forms of damage. Very little is known about the bird in life.

The Mascarene Parrot was first mentioned in 1674, and live specimens were later brought to [[Europe]] where they lived in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]]. The species was scientifically described in 1771. Only two stuffed specimens exist today, in [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]]. The date and cause of extinction for the Mascarene Parrot is unclear. The latest account from 1834 is considered dubious, so it is probable that the species became extinct prior to 1800, and may have become [[extinct in the wild]] even earlier.

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Buffon Mascarinus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|upright|Plate from Buffon's ''Histoire Naturelle'']]
The Mascarene Parrot was first mentioned by the French traveller [[Sieur Dubois]] in his 1674 [[travel literature|travelogue]] and only described a few times from life afterwards. At least three live specimens were brought to [[France]] in the late 18th century and kept in captivity, two of which were described while alive.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> Today, two stuffed specimens exist. The [[holotype]], specimen MNHN 211, is in the [[Mus<U+00E9>um National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris, while the other, specimen NMW 50.688, is in the [[Naturhistorisches Museum]] in Vienna. The latter specimen was bought from the [[Leverian Museum]] during a sale in [[London]] in 1806.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> A third stuffed specimen existed around the turn of the 18th century.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1017/CBO9780511735769.003}}</ref>

The Mascarene Parrot was [[Species description|described]] as ''Psittacus mascarinus''  (abbreviated as "''mascarin''") by Swedish [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in 1771.<ref>{{Cite book

The name is a reference to the [[Mascarene Islands]], which were themselves named after their [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] discoverer, [[Pedro Mascarenhas]].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

Early writers claimed the Mascarene Parrot was found on [[Madagascar]], an idea that led French [[Natural history|naturalist]] and [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] [[Ren<U+00E9> Primev<U+00E8>re Lesson]] to coin the [[junior synonym]] ''Mascarinus madagascariensis'' in 1831.<ref name="Psittaci">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1876.tb06925.x}}</ref> His new [[genus]] name prevailed and, when [[Tommaso Salvadori]] combined it with the earlier specific name in 1891, it became a [[tautonym]] (a scientific name in which the two parts are identical).<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> Lesson also included species of the ''[[Tanygnathus]]'' and ''[[Psittacula]]'' genera in ''Mascarinus'', but this was not accepted by other writers. The following year, German [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] [[Johann Georg Wagler]] erected the genus ''[[Coracopsis]]'' for the Mascarene Parrot (which became ''Coracopsis mascarina'' under this system) and the [[Lesser Vasa Parrot]] (''Coracopsis nigra''). English zoologist [[William Alexander Forbes]], believing that ''mascarinus'' was invalid as a specific name, since it was identical to the genus name, coined the new name ''Mascarinus duboisi'' in 1879, in honour of Dubois.<ref name="Forbes">{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1879.tb07712.x}}</ref>

An unidentified dark parrot seen alive by Swedish naturalist [[Fredrik Hasselqvist]] in [[Africa]] was given the name ''Psittacus obscurus'' by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene Parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed it was from the Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene Parrot.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> This disagreement led some authors to use invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as ''Mascarinus obscurus'' and ''Coracopsis obscura''. The unidentified parrot may have been an [[African Grey Parrot]] (''Psittacus erithacus'') instead.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

Another unidentified parrot specimen, this one brown and housed in [[Cabinet du Roi]], was described by French naturalist [[Comte de Buffon]] in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene Parrot, in which he pointed out similarities and differences between the two. The English [[palaeontologist]] [[Julian Hume]] has suggested the possibility that this might have been a Lesser Vasa Parrot, if not a discoloured old [[Mascarene Grey Parakeet]] (''Psittacula bensoni''). The specimen is now lost.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> English zoologist and author [[George Robert Gray]] assigned some [[Eclectus Parrot]] (''Eclectus roratus'') subspecies from the [[Moluccas]] to ''Mascarinus'' in his book ''A List of the Genera of Birds'' from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1096-3642.1857.tb01231.x}}</ref><ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1859.tb06212.x}}</ref>

[[Subfossil]] parrot remains were later excavated from [[grotto]]s on R<U+00E9>union. [[X-ray]]s of the two existing stuffed Mascarene Parrots made it possible to compare the remaining bones with the subfossils and showed these were intermediate in measurements in comparison to modern specimens. The Lesser Vasa Parrot was introduced to R<U+00E9>union as early as 1780 but, though the subfossil parrot bones were similar to that species in some aspects, they were more similar to those of the Mascarene Parrot and considered to belong to it.<ref name="Avifauna">{{Cite conference

===Evolution===
[[File:Macarene Parrot skull.jpg|thumb|left|Skull elements extracted from the Paris specimen, 1866]]
The affinities of the Mascarene Parrot are unclear, and two hypotheses have competed since the mid-19th century.<ref name="Rothschild"/> Some authors grouped it with the [[Coracopsinae]] (of African origin) due to its dark [[plumage]], and others with the [[Psittaculinae]] parrots (of Asian origin) based on the large red beak, a feature which is diagnostic for that group.<ref name="Forbes"/><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Wagler  | first1 = J. G. |year= 1832 | pages = 501<U+2013>502 |title= Monographia Psittacorum  |publisher= S.N. |location= Munich |language= German and Latin |url= http://archive.org/stream/monographiapsitt00wag#page/500/mode/2up}}</ref> Its plumage pattern was mostly atypical for a psittaculine, though other members have black facial patterns.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

[[Sea level]]s were lower during the [[Pleistocene]], so it was possible for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas.<ref name="Check & Hume 69-71">Check & Hume. (2008). pp. 69<U+2013>71.</ref> Although little is known about most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes, subfossil remains show that they shared common features, such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced [[wikt:pectoral|pectoral]] bones, and robust leg bones. Hume supported their common origin in the [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of the Psittaculini [[Tribe (biology)|tribe]] based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features and the fact that ''Psittacula'' parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> According to this theory, the Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on [[hotspot island]]s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea.<ref name="Check & Hume 69-71"/>

R<U+00E9>union is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the [[volcano]] [[Piton des Neiges]] between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would, therefore, probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene Parrot had, in fact, evolved into a distinct genus on R<U+00E9>union prior to the volcanic eruption, it would have been one of the few survivors of this [[extinction event]].<ref name="Avifauna"/>
[[File:Mascarin.jpg|thumb|upright|1850 illustration by Jean-Baptiste Massard]] 
A 2011 genetic study instead found the Mascarene Parrot to be nested among the subspecies of the Lesser Vasa Parrot from Madagascar and nearby islands and therefore not related to the ''Psittacula'' parrots. It also found that the Mascarene Parrot line diverged 4.6 to 9 million years ago, prior to the formation of R<U+00E9>union, indicating this must have happened elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1016/j.ympev.2011.09.025}}</ref> The [[cladogram]] accompanying the study is shown below:

Another group of scientists later acknowledged the finding but pointed out that the sample might have been damaged and that further testing was needed before the issue could be fully resolved. They also noted that if ''Mascarinus'' was confirmed to be embedded within the ''Coracopsis'' genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Joseph | first = L. | last2 = Toon | first2 = A. | last3 = Schirtzinger | first3 = E.

{{Quotation|Upperparts of head and neck clear (ash) grey. Back, rump, underparts of neck, breast, belly, sides, legs, scapular feathers, uppercoverts of tail very-dark (ash) grey. Wing feathers of the same colour. The tail is composed of 12 feathers: the two median ones are also very-dark (ash) grey. All the lateral ones are of the same colour, except that they have a little white at their base. The eyes are surrounded by a naked skin, bright red. Pupil black, iris red. The base of the superior half of the beak is also surrounded by a red naked skin in which the nostrils are placed. Beak similarly red. Legs pale flesh. Claws grey-brown. I am unaware from which country it is found. I have seen it living in Paris.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>}}
[[File:Mascarene Parrot.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Paris specimen after its skull was removed, 1879]]
Several later authors instead described the body as brown and the head as bluish-[[Lilac (color)|lilac]], based on stuffed specimens, and this has become the orthodox image of the bird. Live birds were never described with these colours. Hume has proposed that this colouration is an artifact of the [[taxidermy]] specimens having aged and being exposed to light, which can turn grey and black to brown. Such a transformation has also turned an aberrant [[Dickcissel]] specimen (sometimes referred to as a distinct species, [[Townsend's Dickcissel]], ''Spiza townsendi'') from grey to brown.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

Confusion over the colouration of the Mascarene Parrot has also been furthered by a plate by French engraver and naturalist [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Nicolas Martinet]] in Buffon's 1779 ''Histoire Naturelle Des Oiseaux'', the first coloured illustration of this species. It shows the bird as brown with a purplish head, and the strength of these colours differs considerably between copies, a result of having been [[hand-coloured]] by many different artists who worked under Martinet in his workshop. Across these copies, the body ranges from [[chestnut brown]] to greyish chocolate, the tail from light grey to blackish grey-brown, and the head from bluish-grey to dove-grey. The plate also lacks two dark central tail feathers without white bases, a feature described by Brisson, and these features have been repeated by subsequent artists. The illustration and Buffon's description were perhaps based on the Paris specimen which had its tail and wing feathers feathers severely damaged by [[sulphuric acid]] in an attempt at [[fumigation]].<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> The Vienna specimen is partially [[albinistic]] and has white feathers on the tail, back, and wings.<ref name="Rothschild">{{Cite book

In 1879, Forbes stated the [[cere]] was covered by feathers which concealed the nostrils.<ref name="Forbes"/> This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and [[mandible]] removed for study by French mammologist and ornithologist [[Alphonse Milne-Edwards]]. This may have led to the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Mascarinus.png|thumb|upright|1907 painting by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]]]]
Very little is known about the Mascarene Parrot in life.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> Since several specimens were kept alive in captivity, it was probably not a [[Generalist and specialist species|specialised feeder]].<ref>Check & Hume. (2008). p. 42.</ref> That the Vienna specimen was partially albinistic may have been the result of a long period in captivity.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> In 1705, Feuilley gave a description of the parrots of R<U+00E9>union and their ecology which indicates that they fattened themselves seasonally:
{{Quotation|There are several sorts of parrot, of different sizes and colours. Some are the size of a hen, grey, the beak red [Mascarene Parrot]; others the same colour the size of a pigeon [Mascarene Grey Parakeet], and yet others, smaller, are green [R<U+00E9>union Parakeet]. There are great quantities, especially in the Sainte-Suzanne area and on the mountainsides. They are very good to eat, especially when they are fat which is from the month of June until the month of September, because at that time the trees produce a certain wild seed that these birds eat.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/>}}

Many other endemic species of R<U+00E9>union became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's [[ecosystem]]. The Mascarene Parrot lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the [[Hoopoe Starling]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Ibis]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Parakeet]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Swamphen]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Owl]], the [[R<U+00E9>union Night Heron]], and the [[R<U+00E9>union Pink Pigeon]]. Extinct R<U+00E9>union reptiles include the [[R<U+00E9>union giant tortoise]] and an undescribed ''[[Leiolopisma]]'' skink. The [[small Mauritian flying fox]] and the snail ''[[Tropidophora carinata]]'' lived on R<U+00E9>union and Mauritius but vanished from both islands.<ref>Check & Hume. (2008). pp. 30<U+2013>43.</ref>

==Extinction==
[[File:Panorama-Cilaos-Greatoutdoors.jpg|thumb|left|Forested mountain area on [[R<U+00E9>union]]]] 
Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the [[Mauritius Parakeet]] (''Psittacula echo'') has survived. The others probably all became extinct due to a combination of excessive hunting and [[deforestation]]. The cause and date of extinction for the Mascarene Parrot itself is uncertain.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> In 1834, German zoologist and author [[Carl Wilhelm Hahn]] published an often-cited account of a live Mascarene Parrot in the possession of [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria]]. The bird must have been very old at the time, and Hahn claimed an accompanying illustration was drawn after this specimen.<ref name="old sources"/> The [[IUCN Red List]] accepts the 1834 account as the last mention of a live specimen.<ref name="IUCN"/>
[[File:Hahn Mascarinus.jpg|thumb|upright|Hahn's 1834 illustration]]
The veracity of Hahn's claim was questioned as early as 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by Fran<U+00E7>ois-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene Parrot was mentioned in the inventory list of species. Hahn did not mention the date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird would probably have been preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious.<ref name="old sources">{{cite journal

If Hahn's account is disregarded, the Mascarene Parrot probably bevame extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on R<U+00E9>union is from the 1770s.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/> It is thought that the Mascarene Parrot went [[extinct in the wild]] while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens are known to have lived there after the last mention of wild birds. In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Levaillant]] stated that the bird was rare and that he had seen three specimens in France.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> One of the last definite accounts of live specimens is the following 1784 description by Mauduyt based on captive birds:
{{Quotation|The Mascarin is found at Ile Bourbon [R<U+00E9>union]; I have seen several alive in Paris, they were rather gentle birds; they had in their favour only that the red beak contrasted agreeably with the dark background of their plumage; they had not learnt to talk.<ref name="Mascarene Parrots"/>}}
Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois mentioned that the Mascarene Parrot was not edible which may have led to R<U+00E9>union visitors mostly ignoring it.<ref>Check & Hume. (2008). p. 107.</ref> It was the last of the indigenous parrots of R<U+00E9>union to go extinct.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> The only endemic bird species on R<U+00E9>union that disappeared after the Mascarene Parrot was the Hoopoe Starling in the mid-19th century.<ref name="Avian extinctions"/>
