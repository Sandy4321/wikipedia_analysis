==Childhood==
Arkell was born in [[Highworth]], Wiltshire, the youngest of a family of seven. His father, James Arkell was a partner in the prosperous family business ''[[Arkell's Brewery]]'' (which is still family owned today). His mother, Laura Jane Arkell was an artist of noted ability.

He developed a deep love of the English countryside from an early age, perhaps gained from long family summer holidays spent at [[Swanage]], Dorset. He was later educated at [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] in Berkshire, where his ability in [[Natural History]] was recognised and he was able to devote significant time to develop his knowledge of this subject. He was a regular prize winner for his natural history essays, one of which was a treatise on the Dorset Robber Flies (''[[Asilidae]]''). He privately published a set of poems, ''Seven Poems'', that reflected his love of nature and the outdoors.

==Student life==
[[File:Newcollege wall-hall-chapel.jpg|290px|right|thumb|New College, Oxford]]
In October 1922, at the second attempt (after failing the [[Latin]] examination), Arkell was admitted to [[New College, Oxford]]. He had initially intended to read [[entomology]] but despite being tutored by the great [[Julian Huxley]], he decided that his career lay in geology and [[palaeontology]]. In 1925 he graduated with [[First Class Honours]] in geology. He remained at the [[University of Oxford]] after being awarded a [[Angela Burdett-Coutts, 1st Baroness Burdett-Coutts#Philanthropy|Burdett-Coutts research scholarship]]. His research topic involved the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the [[bivalves]] from the [[Upper Jurassic]] [[Corallian]] beds of England. For this and other papers on the Jurassic of southern England he was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|D Phil]] in 1928.

Whilst undertaking his doctoral research, Arkell spent four winter seasons (1926<U+2013>30) investigating evidence of [[Palaeolithic]] human remains in the [[Nile Valley]] of [[Egypt]] in association with the [[University of Chicago]]. Four notable [[monographs]] were the result of this work.

==Geological research==

Arkell was awarded a lectureship in geology at [[New College, Oxford]] in 1927, and was made a Senior Research Fellow of that College in 1929. With little teaching or administrative duties to speak of, Arkell was able to devote almost all his time to research. This culminated with the publication in 1933 of ''The Jurassic System of Great Britain''. This 681-page work critically examined and consolidated all previous work on the Jurassic, including the formations described by the pioneer on British geology, [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], in the 19th century. It established Arkell as an authority on the Jurassic, which was remarkable given he was only 29.

He also published extensive work on the Upper Jurassic reef deposits (the Coral Rag) of England. He was an expert on the use of Jurassic [[limestone]]s as building materials, publishing a book on the many different types of limestone used in the buildings of [[Oxford]]. The often obscure terminology used by [[miner]]s and [[quarry]]men was clarified by his dictionary of rock terms. Arkell was interested in the [[tectonic]] history of Southern England, particularly with reference to the highly folded beds of the [[Isle of Purbeck]]. He contributed to reports published by the [[British Geological Survey]], especially around the area of [[Weymouth and Portland]].

The Second World War interrupted his research in 1941 and Arkell worked for the [[Ministry of Transport]] in London] when bombing of that city was at its most intense. In this period he became seriously ill, spending five months in hospital after a [[pneumothorax]] operation.

==University of Cambridge==
After demobilisation at the end of the war, Arkell accepted a Senior Research Fellowship at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], holding an office at the [[Sedgwick Museum]]. In this time Arkell began to work on the use of [[ammonite]]s as [[zone fossils]] in Jurassic stratigraphy and became the leading expert on this specialist area. He was inundated with fossils for identification, particularly from oil companies. As a consequence, he travelled widely in the Middle East examining many Jurassic exposures from this area.

Arkell then consolidated his knowledge of the Jurassic and published ''Jurassic Geology of the World'' in 1956. The large, detailed volume to this day remains a classic and influential text.

==Personal life==
[[File:TrinityCollegeCamGreatCourt.jpg|thumb|[[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at Trinity college, Cambridge]]
Arkell got married to Ruby Percival in 1929 and bought a large house at [[Cumnor]], near Oxford, before moving to Cambridge in 1949. They had three sons, born between 1932 and 1937. They also established a holiday home at [[Ringstead Bay]] in Dorset. Through his link with the family brewery business, Arkell was independently wealthy.

Arkell had a large frame and height (he was {{convert|6|ft|4|in}} tall) but was never a well man. In the autumn of 1956 he suffered a severe stroke which left him partially paralysed and with [[Diplopia|double vision]]. This was a detriment to his Sunday hobby of watercolour painting. Despite this his determination to continue his work and correspondence at the [[University of Cambridge]] continued. He suffered a second stroke on 18 April 1958 and died several hours later.

==Awards and honours==
Arkell received a [[Doctor of Science|D Sc]] from the University of Oxford in 1934. In 1944 he received the [[Mary Clark Thompson Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Thompson>{{cite web |title=Mary Clark Thompson Medal |url= http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_thompson |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref> He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS) in 1947. Arkell was awarded the [[Lyell Medal]] by the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1949, and the [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Leopold von Buch]] medal of the German Geological Society in 1953.
