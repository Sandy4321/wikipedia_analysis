'''Michael Gerard Tyson''' (born [[June 30]] [[1966]]) is a former two-time [[United States|American]] [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight boxing champion]] and is the youngest man to win the heavyweight title.  During his prime in the late 1980s, Tyson was considered one of the greatest heavyweights and one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.
Nicknamed "Iron Mike Tyson", "Kid Dynamite" and "The Baddest Man on the Planet" Tyson adopted the [[Arabic name|Muslim name]] '''Malik Abdul Aziz''', after his conversion to [[Islam]] while in [[prison]] for his [[rape]] conviction.<ref name="Is_1">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/609111.stm Tyson shows power of prayer], ''[[BBC]] News'', [[2000-01-18]], Retrieved on [[2007-05-03]].</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/04/13/tyson-bollywood.html Mike Tyson goes Bollywood], ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].ca Arts'', [[2007-04-13]], Retrieved on [[2007-05-03]].</ref> For his behavior both in and out of the ring, [[ESPN]] has ranked Tyson as the #1 Most Outrageous Character in modern [[sports history]] as determined by a panel of experts and an internet poll.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=listranker/outrageousresults ESPN25: The 25 Most Outrageous Characters], ''[[ESPN25]].com'', Retrieved on [[2007-04-01]].</ref>

Trained by [[Hall of Fame]] trainer [[Cus D'Amato]] early in his career, Tyson unified the belts in the splintered heavyweight division in the late 1980s and won many of his fights by [[knockout]]. Tyson knocked out his first 19 professional opponents within six rounds, stopping 13 of them in the first round. He reigned as undisputed heavyweight champion for over two years before losing in a shocking upset to [[Buster Douglas]] in early 1990. He was convicted of raping a [[beauty pageant]] contestant in 1992, and after being released from prison in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights before losing in another upset, this time to [[Evander Holyfield]]. In 1997, his rematch with Holyfield ended when Tyson bit off a portion of Holyfield's ear in retaliation for what he perceived as intentional [[headbutt]]s. He fought for a championship again at the age of 35, losing by knockout to [[Lennox Lewis]] in 2002. After losing two consecutive bouts to journeymen, Tyson retired from competitive boxing in 2005. He has since engaged in a series of exhibition bouts in a tour across the US to pay his numerous debts. Despite receiving over [[US Dollar|US$]]30 million for several of his fights and $300 million over his career, Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003.

==Early years==
Tyson was born in the notorious [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of [[Brooklyn]]. His early childhood was marked by strife and hunger, forcing his mother, Lorna Smith Tyson, to provide for her family following the departure of their father, Jimmy Kirkpatrick,<ref name="espn1">Puma, Mike., [http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Tyson_Mike.html Sportscenter Biography: 'Iron Mike' explosive in and out of ring], ''[[ESPN]].com'', [[2005-10-10]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref> when Tyson was two years old. Tyson's reputation as a youth who would beat up anyone who ridiculed his high-pitched, [[lisp]]ing voice was fueled by constant abuse by older children on the streets of Brownsville.<ref name="espn1"/> Expelled from [[junior high school]] for fighting, Tyson passed through [[Youth detention center|juvenile detention centers]], yet remained in trouble with the state for [[petty crime]] and violence. He made his way through the tough streets of New York by [[mugging]] and purse-snatching; by the time he was 13, he had been arrested 38 times.<ref name="stjames">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419201235 Mike Tyson], ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture via findarticles.com'', Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> He eventually ended up at the Tryon School for boys.[[Catskill (town), New York|Johnstown, New York]]. It was at Tryon that Tyson's raw boxing ability and incredible potential in the ring was discovered by a juvenile detention center counselor and former boxer named Bobby Stewart.<ref name="espn1"/> As Tyson was an outstanding physical specimen, Stewart trained him for a few months and then introduced him to the legendary [[Cus D'Amato]].<ref name="espn1"/>

Tyson was later removed from reform school by D'Amato, a well-known boxing trainer whose proteges included former champions [[Floyd Patterson]] and [[Jose Torres|Jos<U+00E9> Torres]].<ref>Roberts & Skutt (1999), [http://www.ibhof.com/d'amato.htm The Boxing Register:Cus D'Amato], ''via [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]], McBooks Press.'', Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref> He saw the young boxer's potential and took him off Stewart's hands to train him; he later became Tyson's [[legal guardian]],<ref name="espn1"/> and Tyson has often mentioned his love for D'Amato as a father figure. Kevin Rooney also trained Tyson under D'Amato, and they were occasionally assisted by [[Teddy Atlas]]   but Atlas was kicked out by D'Amato when Tyson was 15, and Rooney would eventually take over all training duties.
===Amateur career===
As an [[amateur boxing|amateur]], Tyson amassed a 24-3 record and was considered a formidable opponent and prime candidate to represent the USA in the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]]. However, two losses to [[Henry Tillman]] ended his chances to represent the US in the Olympics. In 1984 he was also the [[National Golden Gloves]] Heavyweight Champion.
Tyson turned professional soon after.<ref>[http://www.askmen.com/men/sports_60/67c_mike_tyson.html Mike Tyson], ''Askmen.com'', Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref>

===Rise to stardom===
Tyson made his professional debut on [[March 6]] [[1985]], in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York]]. He defeated Hector Mercedes with a first round [[knockout]].<ref name="espn1"/> Fighting frequently in his first two years as a professional, Tyson won 19 of his first 22 fights by knockout, 13 of which came in the first round.<ref name="rec_0">[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/tysonrec.htm "Iron" Mike Tyson], ''Cyberboxingzone.com Boxing record'', Retrieved on [[2007-04-27]].</ref> The quality of his opponents gradually increased to journeyman fighters and borderline contenders,<ref name="rec_0"/> and his win streak attracted media attention, leading to his being billed as the next great [[heavyweight]] champion. D'Amato died in November 1985, relatively early into Tyson's professional career; some speculate that his death was the genesis of many of the troubles Tyson was to experience later as his life and career progressed.<ref>Hornfinger, [http://www.saddoboxing.com/boxing-article/Cus-Damato-Mike-Tyson.html Cus D'Amato], ''SaddoBoxing.com'', Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref>

Tyson's first nationally [[television|televised]] bout took place on [[February 16]], [[1986]], at [[Houston Field House]] in [[Troy, NY]] against journeyman heavyweight [[Jesse Ferguson]]. Tyson knocked down Ferguson with an uppercut in the fifth round that reportedly broke Ferguson's nose.<ref>Oates, Joyce C., [http://jco.usfca.edu/boxing/tyson.html Mike Tyson], ''[[Life Magazine]] via author's website'', [[1986-11-22]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-11]].</ref> During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to break the clinches and box, the [[Referee (boxing)|referee]] finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. Initially ruled a win for Tyson by disqualification (DQ) of his opponent, the ruling was subsequently "adjusted" as a win by [[Knockout#Technical knockouts|technical knockout]] (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result. The rationale offered for the revised outcome was that the fight was actually stopped because Ferguson could not (rather than would not) continue boxing.

On [[November 22]] [[1986]], Tyson was given his first title fight against [[Trevor Berbick]] for the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) heavyweight championship. Tyson won the title by second round TKO, and at the age of 20 years and 4 months became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.<ref>Pinnington, Samuel., [http://www.britishboxing.net/news_2062-Trevor-Berbick-The-Soldier-of-the-Cross.html Trevor Berbick - The Soldier of the Cross], ''Britishboxing.net'', [[2007-01-31]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-11]].</ref> [[Floyd Patterson]] had been the youngest heavyweight champ to that time, at the age of 21 and 10 months, having won the title by beating Archie Moore in an elimination series following the retirement of [[Rocky Marciano]]. Muhammad Ali holds the record as the second youngest man to take the lineal title from the reigning undisputed champion ([[Sonny Liston]]) in the ring.<ref>A lineal champion is a champion who defeats the previous holder of the championship in a title fight; giving a clearcut line of succession of the championship title. - [http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/champ.htm The Cyber Boxing Zone Lineal World Champions],''Cyberboxingzone.com'', Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref>

At age 20, Tyson was around 210&nbsp;lb (100&nbsp;kg) with approximately 5.5% body fat, and was stocky for his height of 5&nbsp;ft 11.5&nbsp;in (182&nbsp;cm). Because of Tyson's strength, many fighters were said to be too intimidated to hit him<ref>Para, Murali., [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news/para2509.php "Iron" Mike Tyson - His Place in History], ''Eastsideboxing.com'', [[September 25]]. Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> and this was backed up by his above-average hand speed, accuracy, coordination, power, and timing. Tyson was also noted for his defensive abilities.<ref name="peekaboo">Richmann[http://www.saddoboxing.com/2844-mike-tyson-kevin-rooney-reunited.html What If Mike Tyson And Kevin Rooney Reunited?], ''Saddoboxing.com'', [[2006-02-24]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> Holding his hands high in the [[Peek-a-Boo (boxing style)|Peek-a-Boo]] style taught by his mentor [[Cus D'Amato]], he slipped and weaved out of the way of the opponent's punches while closing the distance to deliver his own punches.<ref name="peekaboo"/>

===Undisputed Champion===
Expectations for Tyson were extremely high, and he embarked on an ambitious campaign to fight all the top heavyweights in the world. Tyson defended his title against [[James 'Bonecrusher' Smith]] on [[March 7]] [[1987]], in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. He won by unanimous decision and added Smith's [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) title to his existing belt.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "TYSON UNIFIES W.B.C.-W.B.A. TITLES", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 5, Page 1, Column 4'', [[1987-03-08]].</ref> 'Tyson mania' in the media was becoming rampant.<ref>Bamonte, Bryan., [http://www.dailyiowan.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&uStory_id=cf1ce280-6bad-4cb5-a300-fe79cfdb7bd7 Bad man rising]. ''[[The Daily Iowan]]'', [[2005-10-06]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> He beat [[Pinklon Thomas]] in May with a [[knockout]] in the sixth round.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "TYSON RETAINS TITLE ON KNOCKOUT IN SIXTH", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 5, Page 1, Column 2'', [[1987-05-31]].</ref> On [[August 1]] he took the [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF) title from [[Tony Tucker]] in a twelve round unanimous decision.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "BOXING; TYSON UNDISPUTED AND UNANIMOUS TITLIST", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 51, Column 1'', [[1987-08-02]].</ref> He became the first heavyweight to own all three major belts <U+2014> WBA, WBC, and IBF <U+2014> at the same time. His only other fight in 1987 was in October against the 1984 [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[Super Heavyweight]] [[gold medalist]] [[Tyrell Biggs]],{{Fact|date=October 2007}} that ended with a victory for Tyson by knockout in the seventh round.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "TYSON RETAINS TITLE IN 7 ROUNDS", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 51, Column 1'', [[1987-10-17]].</ref> Also in 1987, [[Nintendo]] released the [[video game]], ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]'', for its [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''Punch-Out!!'' is an early example of a video game endorsed by a professional athlete.

Tyson had three fights in 1988. He faced an aged but still game [[Larry Holmes]] on [[January 22]] [[1988]], and defeated the legendary former champion by fourth round knockout.<ref>Berger, Phil (1988), "Tyson Keeps Title With 3 Knockdowns in Fourth," ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 47, Column 5'', [[1988-01-23]].</ref> This was the only knockout loss Holmes suffered in 75 professional bouts. In March, Tyson then fought contender [[Tony Tubbs]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], fitting in an easy two-round victory amid promotional and marketing work.<ref>Shapiro, Michael. (1988), "Tubbs's Challenge Was Brief and Sad", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section A, Page 29, Column 1'', [[1988-03-22]].</ref>

On [[June 27]] [[1988]], Tyson faced [[Michael Spinks]]. Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from [[Larry Holmes]] via a 15-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks. However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including [[The Ring (magazine)|Ring magazine]]) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion. Tyson knocked out Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round.<ref>Berger, Phil. (1988), "Tyson Knocks Out Spinks at 1:31 of Round 1", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section B, Page 7, Column 5'', [[1988-06-28]].</ref>

===Controversy and upset===
During this period, Tyson's problems outside boxing were also starting to emerge. His marriage to [[Robin Givens]] was heading for [[divorce]],<ref name="divorc1">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5DA1738F931A35755C0A96F948260 SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING; Tyson and Givens: Divorce Is Official], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[New York Times]]'', [[1989-06-02]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> and his future contract was being fought over by [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and [[Bill Cayton]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D91131F933A15752C0A96F948260 SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING; King Accuses Cayton], ''[[New York Times]]'', [[1989-01-20]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> In late 1988, Tyson fired longtime trainer [[Kevin Rooney]], the man many credit for honing Tyson's craft after the death of D'Amato.<ref name="peekaboo"/> Without Rooney, Tyson's skills slowly deteriorated and he became more prone to looking for the one-punch knockout, rather than utilizing the combinations that brought him to stardom.<ref>Cox, Monte D., [http://coxscorner.tripod.com/tyson.html MIKE TYSON: IRON and CLAY], ''Cox's Corner'', Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> He also began to headhunt, neglecting to attack the opponent's body first.<ref name="salon01">Kaufman, King., [http://www.salon.com/news/sports/col/kaufman/2002/05/14/tyson/index.html Tyson: Greatest ever?], ''[[Salon.com]]'', [[2002-05-14]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-27]].</ref> In addition, he lost his defensive skills and began to barrel straight in toward the opponent, neglecting to [[jab]] and slip his way in.<ref>Simmons, Bill., [http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/020611 Say 'goodbye' to our little friend], ''[[ESPN]] Page 2'', [[2002-06-11]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-17]].</ref> In 1989, Tyson had only two fights amid personal turmoil. He faced the popular [[United Kingdom|British]] boxer [[Frank Bruno]] in February in a fight where Bruno managed to stun Tyson at the end of the 1st round,<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/ilove/years/1989/tv3.shtml Bruno vs Tyson], ''[[BBC]] TV'', Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref> although Tyson went on to knock out Bruno in the fifth round. Tyson then knocked out [[Carl Williams (boxer)|Carl "The Truth" Williams]] in one round in July.<ref>Berger, Phil (1989), "Tyson Stuns Williams With Knockout in 1:33," ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 1, Page 45, Column 2'', [[1989-07-22]].</ref>

In 1989, Tyson was granted an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in Humane Letters from [[Central State University]] in Ohio.

By 1990, Tyson seemed to have lost direction, and his personal life and training habits were in disarray. In a fight on [[February 11]] [[1990]], he lost the undisputed championship to [[James Buster Douglas|James "Buster" Douglas]] in Tokyo.<ref name="buster">Kincade, Kevin., [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=4063&more=1 "The Moments": Mike Tyson vs Buster Douglas], ''Eastsideboxing.com'', [[2005-07-12]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref> Tyson was a 1/42 [[betting odds|favorite]], but Douglas was at an emotional peak after losing his mother to a stroke two weeks prior to the fight, and fought the fight of his life.<ref name="buster"/> Tyson failed to find a way past Douglas's lightning fast jab that had a {{convert|12|in|mm|sing=on}} reach advantage over his own. Tyson did send Douglas to the floor in the eighth round, catching him with an uppercut, but Douglas recovered sufficiently to hand Tyson a heavy beating in the subsequent two rounds [after the fight, the Tyson camp would complain that the count was slow and that Douglas had taken longer than ten seconds to get to his feet].<ref>Bellfield, Lee., [http://www.saddoboxing.com/2811-month-boxing-history-buster-douglas-mike-tyson-1990.html Buster Douglas - Mike Tyson 1990], ''Saddoboxing.com'', [[2006-02-16]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-25]].</ref> Just 35 seconds into the 10th round, Douglas unleashed a combination of blows that sent Tyson to the canvas for the first time in his career. He was counted out by referee [[Octavio Meyran]].<ref name="buster"/> The knockout victory by Douglas over Tyson, the previously undefeated "baddest man on the planet" and arguably the most feared boxer in professional boxing at that time, has been described as one of the most shocking [[upset]]s in modern sports history.<ref>Staff, [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/010523upset.html Page 2's List for top upset in sports history], ''[[ESPN]].com'', [[2001-05-23]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref>

===After Douglas===
After the loss, Tyson recovered by knocking out contenders [[Henry Tillman]]<ref>Berger, Phil (1990), "TYSON WINS IN 1st ROUND", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 8, Page 7, Column 4'', [[1990-06-17]].</ref> and [[Alex Stewart]]<ref>Berger, Phil (1990), "BOXING; Tyson Scores Round 1 Victory", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 8, Page 1, Column 5'', [[1990-12-09]].</ref> in the first round in his next two fights. Tyson's victory over the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] Boxing Heavyweight gold medalist (and 1983 Boxing Heavyweight [[silver medalist]] of the [[Pan American Games]]) Tillman enabled Tyson to avenge his early career amateur losses at Tillman's hands. These bouts set up an elimination match for another shot at the undisputed world heavyweight championship, which [[Evander Holyfield]] had taken from Douglas in his first defense of the title.

Tyson, who was the #1 contender, faced #2 contender [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan 'Razor' Ruddock]] on [[March 18]] [[1991]], in Las Vegas. Ruddock at the time was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and is thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights ever. Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee [[Richard Steele (referee)|Richard Steele]] controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson. This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience and the referee had to be escorted from the ring.<ref>Bellfield, Lee., [http://www.saddoboxing.com/939-boxing-history-mike-tyson-ruddock.html March 1991-Mike Tyson vs. Razor Ruddock], ''Saddoboxing.com'', [[2005-03-13]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref>

Tyson and Ruddock met again on [[June 28]] that year, with Tyson knocking down Ruddock twice and winning a 12 round unanimous decision.<ref>Berger, Phil (1991), "Tyson Floors Ruddock Twice and Wins Rematch", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition-Final, Section 1, Page 29, Column 5'', [[1991-06-29]].</ref> A fight between Tyson and Holyfield for the undisputed championship was arranged for the fall of 1991.

==Rape conviction, prison, and aftermath==
However, the much-anticipated match between Tyson and reigning champion Holyfield was not to be. Tyson was arrested in July 1991 for the [[rape]] of [[Miss Black America|Miss Black Rhode Island]], [[Desiree Washington]], in an [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] hotel room. Tyson was convicted on the charge on [[February 10]] [[1992]].<ref>Muscatine, Alison., [http://www-tech.mit.edu/V112/N4/tyson.04w.html Tyson Found Guilty of Rape, Two Other Charges], ''[[The Washington Post]] via MIT-The Tech'', [[1992-02-11]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-11]].</ref> Tyson's trial is chronicled in the book, ''Down For The Count'' by Mark Shaw. <ref>Shaw, Mark. ''Down For The Count: The Shocking Truth Behind the Mike Tyson Rape Trial''. Champaign, IL: Sagamore Publishing, 1992.</ref> It strongly suggests that Tyson would not have been convicted if he had been provided adequate legal defense counsel and that Tyson thus did not receive a fair trial.

Under [[Indiana]] law, a defendant convicted of a [[felony]] must begin serving his [[prison]] sentence immediately after the sentence is imposed. He was given a sentence of six years and was released on March 1995 after serving three years.<ref>Berkow, Ira (1995), "BOXING; After Three Years in Prison, Tyson Gains His Freedom", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition - Final, Section 8, Page 1, Column 2'', [[1995-03-26]].</ref> During his incarceration, Tyson converted to [[Islam]].<ref name="Is_1"/>

Tyson did not fight again until later in 1995. He had two comeback bouts against [[Peter McNeeley]] and [[Buster Mathis Jr.]], which he won easily. Interest in Tyson's first comeback fight since his incarceration was high enough that it grossed more than [[USD]] $96 million worldwide, including a United States record $63 million for [[pay-per-view|PPV]] television. The fight was purchased by 1.52 million homes, setting both PPV viewership and revenue records for that time.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0DE1439F932A3575AC0A963958260 SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING; Record Numbers for Fight], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[New York Times]], [[2005-09-01]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-31]].</ref> The brief 89 second fight wherein McNeeley swiftly crumpled on facing Tyson, elicited criticism that Tyson's management lined up "[[Tomato Can]]s," easily defeatable and unworthy boxers for his return.<ref>Sandomir, Richard (1995), "TV SPORTS; Who Must Tyson Face Next? A Finer Brand of Tomato Can", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late Edition - Final, Section B, Page 8, Column 1'', [[1995-08-22]].</ref>

He regained one belt by easily winning the WBC title from [[Frank Bruno]] (their second fight) in March 1996 by knocking him out in the third round.<ref>Bellfield, Lee., [http://www.saddoboxing.com/967-boxing-history-1996-bruno-tyson-ii.html March 1996 <U+2013> Frank Bruno vs. Mike Tyson II], ''Saddoboxing.com'', [[2005-03-18]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref> Tyson added the WBA belt by defeating champion [[Bruce Seldon]] in one round in September that year.

==The Tyson-Holyfield fights==
===''Tyson vs. Holyfield I''===
{{main|Tyson-Holyfield I}}
Tyson's next defense of his fringe title came against [[Evander Holyfield]], who was in the fourth fight of his own comeback after retiring in 1994 following the loss of his championship to [[Michael Moorer]] [who subsequently lost to [[George Foreman]] by knockout during his first defense]. It was said that Don King and others saw Holyfield, the former champion, who was 34 at the time of the fight and a huge underdog, as a washed up fighter.<ref>Cohen, Andrew., [http://www.wie.org/j15/holyfield.asp Evander Holyfield: God Helps Those Who Help Themselves], ''What is Enlightenment Magazine'', Issue #15 - 1999, Retrieved on [[2007-03-25]].</ref>

On [[November 9]] [[1996]], in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], Tyson faced Holyfield in a title bout dubbed '' 'Finally' ''.

Tyson and Holyfield fought again on [[June 28]] [[1997]]. Originally, Halpern was supposed to be the referee, but after Tyson's camp protested, Halpern stepped aside in favor of [[Mills Lane]].<ref>[http://www.canoe.ca/BoxingTysonHolyfield/jun28_ref.html Lane late replacement, center of action], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via Slam!

==1999 to 2005==
===After Holyfield===
In January 1999, Tyson returned to the ring to fight the [[South Africa]]n [[Francois Botha]], in another fight that ended in controversy. While Botha initially controlled the fight, Tyson allegedly attempted to break Botha's arms during a tie-up and both boxers were cautioned by the referee in the ill-tempered bout. Botha was ahead on points on all scorecards and was confident enough to mock Tyson as the fight continued. Nonetheless, Tyson landed a straight right-hand in the fifth round that knocked out Botha.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/256442.stm Rusty Tyson finds the perfect punch], ''[[BBC]] News'', [[1999-01-17]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref>

Legal problems caught up with Tyson once again. On [[February 6]] [[1999]], Tyson was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, fined $5,000, and ordered to serve two years [[probation]] and perform 200 hours of [[community service]] for [[assault]]ing two motorists after a traffic accident on [[August 31]] [[1998]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/272855.stm Tyson jailed over road rage], ''[[BBC]] News'', [[1999-02-06]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref> He served nine months of that sentence. After his release, he fought Orlin Norris on [[October 23]] [[1999]]. Tyson knocked down Norris with a left hook thrown after the bell sounded to end the first round. Norris injured his knee from the off-the-clinch-punch when he went down and said he was unable to continue the fight. Consequently, the bout was ruled a [[No contest (boxing)|no contest]].<ref>Feour, Royce., [http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1999/Oct-24-Sun-1999/sports/12214536.html No-contest; more trouble], ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'', [[1999-10-24]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref>

In 2000, Tyson had three fights. The first was staged at the [[MEN Arena]], [[Manchester]], [[England]] against [[Julius Francis]]. Following controversy as to whether Tyson should be allowed into the country, he took four minutes to knock out Francis, ending the bout in the second round.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/623865.stm Tyson wastes little time], ''[[BBC]] Sport'', [[2000-01-30]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref> He also fought [[Lou Savarese]] in June 2000 in [[Glasgow]], winning in the first round (the fight lasted only 38 seconds). Tyson continued punching after the referee had stopped the fight, knocking him to the floor as he tried to separate the boxers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sport/2000/tyson/804472.stm Tyson fight ends in farce], ''[[BBC]] Sport'', [[2000-06-25]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref> In October, Tyson fought the similarly controversial [[Andrew Golota]],<ref>Gregg, John., [http://www.boxingtimes.com/analyses/2000/001020tyson_golota.html Iron Mike Makes Golota Quit], ''BoxingTimes.com'', [[2000-10-20]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref> winning in round three after Golota refused to fight.

===''Tyson vs. Lewis''===
[[Image:Lewis-Tyson.jpg|thumb|The [[Lennox Lewis|Lewis]]-Tyson fight that took place on [[June 8]] [[2002]], was one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in years.]]
Tyson once again had the opportunity to fight for a heavyweight championship in 2002, against his former friend, [[Lennox Lewis]], who held the WBC, IBF and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] titles at the time. As promising amateurs, Tyson and Lewis had sparred together at a training camp, in a meeting arranged by Cus D'Amato in 1984.<ref>Rafael, Dan., [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/stories/2002-06-03-tyson-lewis.htm Lewis vs. Tyson: The prequel], ''[[USA Today]]'', [[2002-06-03]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-25]].</ref> Like the Holyfield fights, various circumstances in the 1990s delayed any earlier professional level match-up of Tyson with Lewis.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Tyson sought to fight Lewis in Nevada for a more lucrative box-office venue, but the Nevada boxing commission refused him a license to box as he was facing possible [[sexual assault]] charges at the time.<ref name="rap1">[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/01/30/tyson-crime020130.html Mike Tyson rap sheet], ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].ca'', [[2007-01-12]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-25]].</ref>

Two years prior to the bout, in a post fight interview following the Savarese fight, Tyson had made several inflammatory remarks to Lewis, "I want your heart, I want to eat your children."<ref>York, Anthony., [http://archive.salon.com/news/sports/bounds/2000/06/28/bounds2/ "I want to eat your children, ...], ''[[Salon.com]]'', [[2000-06-28]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-26]].</ref> On [[January 22]] [[2002]], a brawl involving the two boxers and their entourages occurred at a [[News conference|press conference]] held in New York to publicize the planned event.<ref>[[Associated Press|AP]], [http://espn.go.com/boxing/news/2002/0122/1315536.html Tyson media circus takes center stage], ''[[ESPN]].com'', [[2002-01-22]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref> The melee put to rest any chance of a Nevada fight and alternative arrangements had to be made, with the fight eventually occurring on [[June 8]] at the [[Pyramid Arena]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Lewis dominated the fight and knocked out Tyson in the eighth round. Tyson was magnanimous after the fight and praised Lewis on his victory.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/boxing/specials/lewis_v_tyson_fight/2032422.stm Lewis stuns Tyson for famous win], ''[[BBC]] Sport'', [[2002-06-09]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref> This fight was the highest-grossing event in [[pay-per-view]] history at that time, generating $106.9 million from 1.95 million buys in the USA.<ref name="Multichannel News 2007-02-26"/><ref name="ppv_2"/>

===Late career, bankruptcy and retirement===
On [[February 22]] [[2003]], Tyson beat fringe contender [[Clifford Etienne]] 49 seconds into round one, once again in Memphis. The pre-fight was marred by rumors of Tyson's lack of fitness and that he took time out from training to party in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and get a new facial [[tattoo]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/boxing/news/2003/0222/1513016.html Etienne's night ends 49 seconds into first round], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[ESPN.com]]'', [[2003-02-22]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref> This would be Tyson's final professional victory in the ring.

In August 2003, after years of financial struggles, Tyson finally filed for [[bankruptcy]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/3120237.stm Tyson files for bankruptcy], ''[[BBC]] Sport'', [[2002-08-03]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref> Tyson is said to have squandered nearly $300&nbsp;million in ring earnings through lavish spending and bad advice. In 2003, amid all his economic troubles, he was named by ''[[Ring Magazine]]'' at number 16, right behind [[Sonny Liston]], among [[Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time|the 100 greatest punchers of all time]].

On [[July 30]] [[2004]], Tyson faced the British boxer [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]] in another comeback fight, this time staged in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Tyson dominated the opening two rounds. The third round was even, with Williams getting in some clean blows and also a few illegal ones, for which he was penalized. In the fourth round, Tyson was unexpectedly knocked out. After the fight, it was revealed that Tyson was trying to fight on one leg, having torn a [[ligament]] in his other knee in the first round. This was Tyson's fifth career defeat.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/3935121.stm Williams shocks Tyson], ''[[BBC]] Sports'', [[2004-07-31]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref> He underwent surgery for the ligament four days after the fight. His manager, Shelly Finkel, claimed that Tyson was unable to throw meaningful right-hand punches after the knee injury.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/3942971.stm Tyson camp blames injury], ''[[BBC]] Sports'', [[2004-07-31]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref>

On [[June 11]] [[2005]], Tyson stunned the boxing world by quitting before the start of the seventh round in a close bout against journeyman [[Kevin McBride]]. After losing the third of his last four fights, Tyson said he would quit boxing because he no longer had "the fighting guts or the heart anymore." <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/4084744.stm Tyson quits boxing after defeat], ''[[BBC]] Sport'', [[2005-06-12]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-14]].</ref>

==Legacy==
Although Tyson was considered a formidable champion during his prime, his apparent lack of discipline and self control, both in and out of the ring, led to a series of personal problems as well as periods of imprisonment. After being released from prison in 1995, Tyson failed to reclaim his previous dominance during his heavily anticipated comeback. His greatest impact upon the boxing world was as a fighter during the 1980s, as the latter part of his career was overshadowed by controversy, although he eventually regained two [[Championship belt|title belts]]. A 1998 ranking of "The Greatest Heavyweights of All-Time" by [[The Ring (magazine)|Ring magazine]] placed Tyson at #14 on the list.<ref>{{cite book | author = The Editors of Ring Magazine

==After professional boxing==
[[Image:Just before I had him.jpg|thumb|left|Mike Tyson giving an [[Individual events (speech)#After Dinner Speaking|after dinner speech.]]]]
On the front page of ''[[USA Today]]'' on [[June 3]] [[2005]], Tyson was quoted as saying: "My whole life has been a waste - I've been a failure." He continued: "I just want to escape. I'm really embarrassed with myself and my life. I want to be a [[missionary]]. I think I could do that while keeping my dignity without letting people know they chased me out of the country. I want to get this part of my life over as soon as possible. In this country nothing good is going to come of me. People put me so high; I wanted to tear that image down."<ref name="UST1">Saraceno, Jon., [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/boxing/2005-06-02-tyson-saraceno_x.htm Tyson: 'My whole life has been a waste'], ''[[USAToday]].com'', [[2005-06-02]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-11]].</ref> Tyson began to spend much of his time tending to his 350 pigeons in [[Paradise Valley, Arizona|Paradise Valley]], an upscale enclave near [[Phoenix, Arizona]].<ref>[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8305426/ Tyson has flown coop in new home], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[MSNBC]].com'', [[2005-06-22]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-27]].</ref>

On [[December 29]] [[2006]], Tyson was arrested in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], on suspicion of [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] and [[felony]] [[drug possession]] after he nearly crashed into a police [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] shortly after leaving a night club. According to a police probable-cause statement, filed in [[Maricopa County]] Superior Court, "He (Tyson) admitted to using (drugs) today and stated he is an addict and has a problem."<ref>Gaynor, Tim., [http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/061229/3/45pl7.html Mike Tyson arrested on cocaine charges], ''[[Reuters]] via Yahoo.com'', [[2007-12-30]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-15]].</ref> Tyson pleaded not guilty on [[January 22]] [[2007]], in Maricopa County Superior Court to felony drug possession and paraphernalia possession counts and two misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence of drugs.

Prosecutors had requested a year long jail sentence, but the judge praised Tyson for seeking help with his drug problems. <ref>BBC NEWS, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7102471.stm Tyson Jailed on Drugs Charges], ''news.bbc.com'', [[2007-11-19]], Retrieved on [[2007-11-19]].</ref>

==Marriage and children==
Tyson has been legally married twice and has had children with several different women. His first marriage was to actress [[Robin Givens]], then known for her work on the sitcom ''[[Head of the Class]]'', from [[February 7]], [[1988]] to [[February 14]], [[1989]].<ref name="divorc1"/> Tyson's marriage to Givens was especially tumultuous with allegations of violence, [[spousal abuse]] and mental instability.<ref name="givens1">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n3_v44/ai_6932688 Mike Tyson vs. Robin Givens: the champ's biggest fight], ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] via findarticles.com'', January 1989, Retrieved on [[2007-04-24]].</ref> Matters came to a head when Tyson and Givens gave a joint interview with [[Barbara Walters]] on the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Television|TV]] [[newsmagazine]] show ''[[20/20]]'' in September 1988, in which Givens described life with Tyson as "torture, pure hell, worse than anything I could possibly imagine."<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD7123CF933A0575AC0A96E948260 Wife Discusses Tyson], ''[[Associated Press|AP]] via [[New York Times]]'', [[1988-09-30]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-24]].</ref> Givens also described Tyson as "[[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]]" on national television while Tyson looked on with an intent and calm expression.<ref name="givens1"/> A month later, Givens announced that she was seeking a divorce from Tyson.<ref name="givens1"/> Tyson's marriage to Givens did not produce any children.

His second marriage was to Monica Turner from [[April 19]] [[1997]] <U+2013> [[January 14]] [[2003]].<ref name="divorc2">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_6_103/ai_97235749 Tyson finalizes divorce, could pay ex $9 million], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]] via findarticles.com'', [[2003-02-03]], Retrieved on [[2007-04-24]].</ref> At the time of the divorce filing, Turner worked as a pediatric resident at [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|Georgetown University Medical Center]] in [[Washington DC]].<ref name="smg1">[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/tysondiv1.html The Smoking Gun: Archive], ''[[The Smoking Gun]], Retrieved on [[2007-03-30]].</ref> She is also the sister of [[Michael S. Steele|Michael Steele]], the former [[Lieutenant Governor]] of [[Maryland]]. Turner filed for divorce from Tyson in January 2002, claiming that he committed [[adultery]] during their five-year marriage, an act that "has neither been forgiven nor condoned."<ref name="smg1"/>

Tyson has six children: Gena, Mikey, Rayna, Amir, Miguel, and Exodus.<ref name="UST1"/> Rayna (born [[February 14]] [[1996]]) and Amir ([[August 5]] [[1997]]) are from his second wife.<ref name="smg1"/>
