The '''711th Special Operations Squadron''' ('''711 SOS''') is part of the [[919th Special Operations Wing]] at [[Duke Field]], Florida. It is an [[Air Force Reserve Command]] unit that is operationally gained by [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] if called to active duty.

The squadron was first activated during [[World War II]] as the '''711th Bombardment Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[European Theatre of World War II|European Theater]], where it engaged in strategic [[bombing|bombardment]] missions against Germany.  [[Robert Edward Femoyer|2d Lieutenant Robert E. Femoyer]], of the 711th Bombardment Squadron, was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his heroic actions during a mission over [[Merseburg, Germany]], on 2 November 1944.  The group returned to the United States following the war and was inactivated.

The squadron was activated in the reserves as a [[light bomber]] unit in 1949 and served until it was called to active duty in 1951 as a result of the [[Korean War]] and its personnel used as fillers for regular  units.

In 1955, the squadron was again activated in the reserves as the '''711th Fighter-Bomber Squadron'''.  It trained with [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]]s and [[North American F-86 Sabre]]s until being replaced by the [[69th Troop Carrier Squadron]] in 1957.

The squadron activated in 1971 as the '''711th Tactical Airlift Squadron''' at [[Duke Field]], Florida with the mission of intratheater airlift, using [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]] Aircraft.  Three years later, it converted to the AC-130 gunship model of the Hercules and became the '''711th Special Operations Squadron'''.  In 1995 it converted to a third type of C-130 when it began to fly the MC-130 Combat Talon model.  In 2013 it re-equipped with [[PZL C-145A Skytruck]]s and its mission became one of providing training and support for friendly nations.

==Mission==
In May 2013 the 711 SOS ended its 42 year mission operating the Lockheed C-130 aircraft to transition to an aviation foreign internal defense mission flying [[PZL C-145A Skytruck]]s.<ref>{{cite web | last =King| first =TSgt Samuel| authorlink = | year = 2013| url= http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123344937|title = Air Force Combat Talons fly for last time | work =| publisher = 919 Special Operations Wing| accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref>

====Training in the United States====
The squadron was first activated on 1 May 1943 at [[Ephrata Army Air Base]], Washington as the '''711th Bombardment Squadron''', one of the four squadrons of the [[447th Bombardment Group]].<ref name=Maurer711BS/><ref name=Maurer447BG>{{cite book|editor=Maurer, Maurer|title=Air Force Combat Units of World War II|origyear= 1961|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/af_combat_units_wwii.pdf |edition=reprint|year=1983|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-02-1|lccn=61060979|pages=321<U+2013>322}}</ref>

The original mission of the squadron was to be an operational training unit.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Surridge, & Dooley, Edward C.|title=Pictorial History of the 447th Bombardment Group (H)|url= http://digicom.bpl.lib.me.us/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1108&context=ww_reg_his  |accessdate=January 16, 2014|series=

The [[en cadre|cadre]] trained at [[Brooksville Army Air Field]] with the [[1st Bombardment Squadron]], engaging in simulated attacks against Mobile, Charleston and New Orleans.  The squadron then trained at [[Rapid City Army Air Base]], South Dakota with the [[17th Bombardment Training Wing]].  In June 1943 the group moved to [[Harvard Army Air Field]], Nebraska for Phase I training.<ref>Surridge & Dooley, pp. 19-21</ref>  The unit sailed on the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]] on 23 November 1943 and arrived at the [[Firth of Clyde]] on 29 November 1943.<ref name=Freeman>{{cite book|last=Freeman|first = Roger A.|title=The Mighty Eighth: Units, Men and Machines (A History of the US 8th Army Air Force)|year=1970 |publisher=Macdonald and Company|location=London, England, UK |isbn= 978-0-87938-638-2|page=257}}</ref>  The squadron's B-17s began to move from the United States to the European theater of operations in November 1943.<ref name=Maurer711BS/>

====Combat in the European Theater====
[[File:447bgroup-b-17-7397.jpg|thumb|Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress 42-97392 711th BS, 'Ramblin Wreck']]
The squadron was stationed at [[RAF Rattlesden]], England, from December 1943 to August 1945. It flew its first combat mission on 24 December 1943 against a V-1 missile site near [[Saint-Omer]] in Northern France.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/571.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group May 1943-Apr 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

From December 1943 to May 1944, the squadron helped prepare for the invasion of the European continent by attacking submarine pens, naval installations, and cities in Germany; missile sites and ports in France; and airfields and marshaling yards in France, Belgium and Germany.<ref name=447globalsecurity>{{cite web |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/447aeg.htm |last1=|first1=|title=447th Air Expeditionary Group|date=|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>  The squadron conducted heavy bombardment missions against German aircraft industry during [[Big Week]], 20 to 25 February 1944.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>

The unit supported the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 by bombing airfields and other targets.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>  On [[D-Day]] the squadron bombed the beachhead area using pathfinder aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/574.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group Mar-Jun 1944|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

The squadron aided in the breakthrough at St. Lo, France, and the effort to take Brest, France, from July to September 1944.<ref name=Maurer447BG/> It bombed strategic targets from October to December 1944, concentrating on [[oil refinery|sources of oil production]].<ref name=Maurer447BG/>   It assaulted marshalling yards, railroad bridges and communication centers during the Battle of the Bulge from December 1944 to January 1945.<ref name=Maurer447BG/> In March 1945 the group bombed an airfield in support of airborne assault across the Rhine.  The unit flew its last combat mission on 21 April 1945 against a marshalling yard at [[Ingolstadt]], Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/092/584.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, History 447 Bombardment Group Apr 1945|date=|publisher=Air Force History Index|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

On 2 November 1944, [[Robert Edward Femoyer|2d Lieutenant Robert E. Femoyer]], a navigator with the squadron, was flying a mission to [[Merseburg]], Germany.  His B-17 was damaged by [[flak]] and Lt. Femoyer was severely injured in his back and side.  He refused morphine to relieve the pain of his injuries in order to keep his mind alert to navigate the plane out of the danger from heavily defended flak areas and then to a place of safety for his crew.  Because he was too weak to climb back in his seat, he asked other crew members to prop him up so he could read his charts and instruments.  For more than two hours he directed the navigation of his plane back to its home station with no further damage.  Shortly after being removed from his plane, Lt. Femoyer died of his injuries.<ref name=Maurer447BG/><ref>Freeman, p. 180</ref>

The 711th redeployed to the United States during the summer 1945. The air echelon ferried their aircraft and personnel back to the United States, leaving on 29 and 30 June 1945. The squadron ground echelon, along with the 709th squadron sailed 3 August 1945 on the [[List of Liberty ships (A<U+2013>F)|SS Benjamin R. Milam]], from Liverpool.  Most personnel were discharged at [[Camp Myles Standish]] after arrival at the port of [[Boston]].  A small cadre proceeded to [[Drew Field]], Florida<ref>Surridge & Dooley, pp. 214-215</ref> and the squadron inactivated on 7 November 1945.<ref name=Maurer447BG/>

===Pre-Korean War reserve operations===
The squadron was redesignated as a [[light bomber]] unit and activated in the postwar reserve at [[Long Beach Municipal Airport]] and assigned to the [[448th Bombardment Group]]. It had no tactical aircraft assigned, but flew twin engine trainers<ref name=711SOSfacts/> and trained with the '''2347th Air Force Reserve Training Center'''.<ref name=Ravenstein>{{cite book|last=Ravenstein|first=Charles A.|title=Air Force Combat Wings, Lineage & Honors Histories 1947-1977|url= http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/combat_wings.pdf |year=1984|publisher=Office of Air Force History|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-912799-12-9|page=244}}</ref> The squadron was called to active duty for the  [[Korean War]] in 1951.  The squadron's personnel were reassigned to other organizations, then the unit was inactivated a few days later as a paper unit.<ref name=Maurer711BS/>

===Reserve fighter operations===
The squadron was redesignated the '''711th Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and again activated as a reserve unit in 1955 at [[Hensley Field]], Texas when the [[448th Fighter-Bomber Wing]] replaced the '''8709th Pilot Training Wing''' at [[Hensley Field]], Texas.  The wing took over the [[T-28 Trojan]] aircraft of the 8709th, but soon re-equipped with [[Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star]]s.  The squadron flew the F-80 until 1957, when it began converting to the [[North American F-86 Sabre]].<ref name=Ravenstein/>  However, later that year, the 711th<ref name=Maurer711BS/> and the remainder of the 448th wing were inactivated<ref name=Ravenstein/> when reserve operations at Hensley converted to the [[airlift]] mission and the [[69th Troop Carrier Squadron]] moved to Hensley from [[Tinker Air Force Base]], Oklahoma.<ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', p. 258</ref>

===Reserve special operations===
[[File:Lockheed AC-130A Hercules (L-182), USA - Air Force AN1255112.jpg|thumb|711th Lockheed AC-130A Hercules on display at [[Eglin AFB]].  This is the first Hercules built]]
The unit reactivated in 1971 at [[Duke Field]], Florida as the '''711th Tactical Airlift Squadron''', a reserve intratheater airlift squadron equipped with the [[Lockheed C-130A Hercules]].  Its mission was the airlift of personnel and cargo as well as airdrop support for [[United States Army|Army]] paratroopers during [[military exercise|exercises]].<ref name=711SOSfacts/>

In late 1974, the squadron began transitioning to the AC-130A Spectre aircraft<ref name=711SOSfacts/> and when transition to gunships was complete the squadron was redesignated as the '''711th Special Operations Squadron''' in the summer of the following year.<ref name=711SOSfacts/>  [[Close air support]] of conventional and special operations ground forces became the unit's primary duty, but additional capabilities included the ability to perform armed interdiction, [[aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]], and escort, [[forward air control]] and [[combat search and rescue]] in conventional or unconventional warfare settings.<ref name=919SOWfacts>{{cite web |url= http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10364 |last1=Endicott|first1=Judy G.|title=Factsheet 919 Special Operations Wing (AFRC)|date=8/7/2008|publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref>

Because the Spectres' advanced sensors were useful in range reconnaissance and range clearing tasks, the 711th also provided missile range support to the Air Force's [[Eastern Range]] at [[Cape Canaveral AFS]] from 1979 to 1989 and [[space shuttle]] support to [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] from 1981 to 1988.<ref name=711SOSfacts/><ref name=919SOWfacts/>

The 711th flew pre-strike reconnaissance, [[fire support]], escort, and air base defense sorties during [[Operation Just Cause]], the United States intervention in Panama from 8 December 1989 to 7 January 1990, for which it earned an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]].<ref name=711SOSfacts/>

The 711th again flew combat missions during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in Southwest Asia from February through March 1991.<ref name=711SOSfacts/>  The squadron deployed five aircraft and eight [[aircrew]]s to [[King Fahd International Airport]], near [[Dhahran]], Saudi Arabia, arriving on 7 February and flying its first sortie two days later.<ref name=Bergeron>{{cite book|last=Bergeron|first=TSG Randy G.|title=Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Air Force Special Operations Command in the Gulf War|url= http://www.aircommando.org/shared/media/document/AFD-051228-018.pdf |accessdate=January 25, 2014|edition=Reprint
|origyear=|year=2001|publisher=Air Force Special Operations Command History Office|location=Hurlburt Field, FL|isbn= |pages=39<U+2013>40}}</ref>  On 26 February three of the squadron's AC-130As attacked the [[Highway of Death|Jahra to Basra road]], which was being used by fleeing Iraqi troops.  Fighter aircraft had struck the road, and numerous vehicles were backed up on the road, struggling to make their way north.  Ghost 10 was the first squadron aircraft to attack, but it had to depart the area after destroying five vehicles due to its low fuel situation.  It was replaced by Ghost 06 and Ghost 07, which destroyed an additional 29 vehicles, including four armored personnel carriers.  The squadron flew 59 sorties during the war, and performed airlift as well as gunship missions. It departed the theater on 12 March and arrived at Duke on 19 March.<ref>Bergeron, pp. 104-106</ref>

The squadron's primary mission changed in late 1995 as the unit transitioned to the MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft. In its new role, the squadron provided long-range [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] delivery of special operations forces and equipment. It periodically deployed personnel and aircraft to support special operations contingency operations worldwide, as well as numerous [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] missions.<ref name=711SOSfacts/>  Beginning in 1 October 1997, the 711th also provided the flight portion of MC-130E Combat Talon I training for both [[Air Force Special Operations Command]] and [[Air Force Reserve Command]].<ref name=711SOSfacts/>

After September 2001, the 711th frequently deployed aircraft and personnel to Iraq and Afghanistan in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].<ref>''See'' {{cite web |url= http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=16113 |last1=|first1=|title=919th Special Operations Wing|date=9/6/2013|publisher=919th Special Operations Wing Public Affairs|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref>

The squadron ended forty-two years of operating with the Hercules in 2013, when it transitioned into the [[PZL C-145 Skytruck]]
[[short takeoff and landing]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123375560 |last1=|first1=|title=Rolling in|date=12/31/2013|publisher=911th Special Operations Wing|deadurl=no |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref>  The unit's new mission is aviation foreign internal defense.  Aviation foreign internal defense is a special operations forces mission employing airmen as combat aviation advisors to assess, train, advise and assist foreign nations in aviation. It supports friendly nations to assist the United States in achieving strategic political and military goals. In this mission the squadron is a reserve associate unit operating and maintaining aircraft of the [[6th Special Operations Squadron]] a colocated regular unit.<ref>{{cite web |url=  http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123322129 |last1=Comtois|first1=Col.
