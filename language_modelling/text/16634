[[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] is the home of several companies, such as [[Mack Trucks]], [[Air Products & Chemicals]], [[PPL (utility)|PPL]], and others. The largest employer in the Lehigh Valley is [[Lehigh Valley Hospital]] with almost 8,000 employees.

Mack Trucks will be relocating to Greensboro, North Carolina in 2009. Over 600 jobs are expected to be lost.

The city formerly relied on manufacturing for its economy.  Steel plants have since closed, and manufacturing is no longer a main part of the economy.
==Shopping==
The flagship store of [[Hess's]] was a 5-story department store in Center City, until its closure in 1994.  Since then, the Hamilton Street shopping area has not flourished.  The MacArthur Road/7th Street corridor in Whitehall has become the main shopping area.  This area includes many stores, along with two malls, [[Lehigh Valley Mall]] and [[Whitehall Mall]]. These two malls together have 5 major department stores. 

Another mall in Allentown is the [[South Mall]] on Lehigh Street. It hosts Bon-Ton, Stein Mart, Petco, Staples, and Gold's Gym.

[[The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley]] is an outdoor shopping mall with more upscale stores and restaurants. It is located south of the city.
