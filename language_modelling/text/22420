The '''''Pok<U+00E9>mon''''' [[video game]] series is a [[Console role-playing game|role-playing game]] franchise from [[Nintendo]]. The series is unusual in that games are commonly released in pairs, each with slight variations. First released in 1996 in Japan for the [[Game Boy]], the franchise has continued with at least two new games for each Game Boy generation.

Nintendo stated that the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' franchise has sold over 175 million units as of April 23, 2008.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/9NH7dkYdedNEp7fwhDrI2NSqsKPVna6B|title=Fans Can Actually Become a Pok<U+00E9>mon with Two New Nintendo DS Games|accessdate=2008-04-25|date=2008-04-23|publisher=[[Nintendo]]}}</ref>

==Generations==
The original Pok<U+00E9>mon games were Japanese [[Console role-playing game|RPGs]] with an element of strategy, and were created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]] for the [[Game Boy]]. These role-playing games, and their sequels, remakes, and English language translations, are still considered the "main" Pok<U+00E9>mon games, and the games with which most fans of the series are familiar.

All of the licensed Pok<U+00E9>mon properties overseen by [[The Pok<U+00E9>mon Company]] are divided roughly by generation. These generations are roughly [[chronology|chronological]] divisions by release; every several years, when an official sequel in the main RPG series is released that features new Pok<U+00E9>mon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga and trading card game are all updated with the new Pok<U+00E9>mon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise is currently in its fourth generation.

The Pok<U+00E9>mon franchise began in its first generation with its initial release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue#Pocket Monsters|''Pocket Monsters Aka'' and ''Midori'']] for the [[Game Boy]] in Japan. When these games proved extremely popular, an enhanced ''Ao'' version was released sometime after, and the ''Ao'' version was reprogrammed as [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] for international release. The games launched in the United States on September 30, 1998. The original ''Red'' and ''Green'' versions were never released outside of Japan.<ref>[http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gameboy/data/924467.html "Pok<U+00E9>mon Green Info on GameFAQs"] ''gamefaqs.com'' URL Accessed February 23, 2007</ref> Afterwards, a further enhanced remake titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'' was released to partially take advantage of the color palette of the [[Game Boy Color]], as well as to feature more of a stylistic resemblance to the popular ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime. This first generation of games introduced the original 151 species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (in [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon|National Pok<U+00E9>dex]] order, encompassing all Pok<U+00E9>mon from [[Bulbasaur]] to [[Mew (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Mew]]), as well as the basic game concepts of capturing, training, battling, and trading Pok<U+00E9>mon with both computer and human players. These versions of the games take place within the fictional [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]] [[Pok<U+00E9>mon regions|region]], though the name "Kanto" was not used until the second generation. Spin-off first-generation titles include ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Pinball]]'', an adaptation of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game (video game)|Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' for [[Game Boy Color]], an on-rails photography simulator for [[Nintendo 64]] titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]]'', a Nintendo 64 Pok<U+00E9>mon-themed adaptation of ''[[Tetris Attack]]'' named ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Puzzle League]]'', a 3D Nintendo 64 incarnation of the handheld RPGs' battle system named ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Stadium]]'' and a co-starring role for several species in the Nintendo 64 fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]''.<ref>''Super Smash Bros.''

The second generation of Pok<U+00E9>mon began in [[2000 in video gaming|2000]] with the release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] for [[Game Boy Color]]. Like the previous generation, an enhanced remake titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal]]'' was later released. It introduced 100 new species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Chikorita]] and ending with [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (241-260)#Celebi|Celebi]]), for a total of 251 Pok<U+00E9>mon to collect, train, and battle. New gameplay features include a day-and-night system (reflecting the time of the day in the real world) which influences events in the game; full utilization of the Game Boy Color's color palette; an improved interface and upgraded inventory system; better balance in the collection of Pok<U+00E9>mon and their moves, statistics, and equippable items (a new addition); [[Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics#Pok<U+00E9>mon breeding|Pok<U+00E9>mon breeding]];, a new region named [[Johto]] and the new version difference, which gender the player could be. Unique to the second generation games is the fact that, after exploring Johto, the player can enter and explore the original Kanto region, which lies to the east of Johto. Spin-off second-generation titles include the Game Boy Color adaptation of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Puzzle League'' named ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Puzzle Challenge]]'', a Nintendo 64 pet simulator named ''[[Hey You, Pikachu!]]'', the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Stadium'' sequel ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Stadium 2]]'' for Nintendo 64, several Pok<U+00E9>mon mini-games for the [[e-Reader]], and a co-starring role for many species in the ''Super Smash Bros.'' sequel ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]].<ref>[http://www.nintendo.com/codegallery?gameid=m-Game-0000-587#m-CodeItem-0000-5887 ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' Unlockable character guide] ''Nintendo.com''.

[[Image:Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald screenshot.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]'' featuring an enemy [[Pupitar]] and [[Solrock]] fighting in a double battle against a player's [[Aggron]] and [[Smeargle]]]]
''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' entered its third generation with the [[2003 in video gaming|2003]] release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] for [[Game Boy Advance]] and continued with the Game Boy Advance remakes of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue'', [[Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], and an enhanced remake of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire'' titled ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]''. The third generation introduced 135 new Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Treecko]] and ending with [[Deoxys]]) for a total of 386 species. It also features a much more visually detailed environment compared to previous games, a new 2-on-2 Pok<U+00E9>mon battling mechanic, a special ability system applying to each Pok<U+00E9>mon in battle, the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Contest]] sub-game, and the new region of [[Hoenn]]. However, this generation also garnered some criticism for leaving out several gameplay features, including the day-and-night system introduced in the previous generation (it had to be removed due to internal battery save problems), and it was also the first installment that encouraged the player to collect merely a selected assortment of the total number of Pok<U+00E9>mon rather than every existing species (202 out of 386 species are catchable in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' versions). Third-generation spin-off titles include ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Pinball: Ruby and Sapphire]]'' for Game Boy Advance; ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon]]'' for Game Boy Advance and [[Nintendo DS]]; ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Dash]]'', ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trozei!]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger]]'' for Nintendo DS; ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Channel]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Box: Ruby & Sapphire]]'' for Nintendo GameCube; and a separate RPG series for Nintendo GameCube, consisting of the games ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]''.

In [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], Japan began the fourth generation of the franchise with the release of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] for Nintendo DS. The games were subsequently released in North America on April 22, 2007 and in Australia on June 21, 2007. The game was then later released in the UK and Europe on July 27, 2007.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemondiamond/news.html?sid=6163662 "New Pok<U+00E9>mon to Make Diamond-and-Pearl-Studded Debut"]. Accessed February 7, 2007.</ref> The fourth generation introduces another 107 new species of Pok<U+00E9>mon (starting with [[Turtwig]] and ending with [[Arceus]]), bringing the current total of Pok<U+00E9>mon species to 493. New gameplay concepts include a restructured [[Pok<U+00E9>mon moves|move]]-classification system, online multiplayer trading and battling via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], the return (and expansion) of the second generation's day-and-night system, the expansion of the third generation's Pok<U+00E9>mon Contests into "Super Contests", and the new region of [[Sinnoh]], which has an underground component for multiplayer gameplay in addition to the main overworld. Also, a new entry to the Diamond/Pearl generation is in the works, called ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Platinum]]'', which was announced in May 2008's [[CoroCoro]].<ref> It was released in Japan on 13th September 2008.

==Game mechanics==
{{main|Pok<U+00E9>mon game mechanics}}
===Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon===
{{main|Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon}}
One of the consistent aspects of most ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games <U+2014> spanning from [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the [[Nintendo DS]] game, [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] <U+2014> ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Battle Revolution]]'' is the choice of one of three different Pok<U+00E9>mon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labeled "starter Pok<U+00E9>mon". Players can choose a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]], a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Water-type|Water-type]], Pok<U+00E9>mon indigenous to that particular region.<ref name=spy> [http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' review (page 1)] ''Gamespy.com''. Accessed May 30, 2006.</ref>  For example, in ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Red'' and ''Blue'', the player has the choice of starting with [[Bulbasaur]], [[Charmander]], or [[Squirtle]]. The exception to this rule is ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'', where players are given a [[Pikachu]], an [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Electric-type|Electric-type]] mouse Pok<U+00E9>mon, famous for being the mascot of the Pok<U+00E9>mon media franchise; in this game, however, the three starter Pok<U+00E9>mon from ''Red'' and ''Blue'' can be obtained during the quest by a single player, something that is not possible in any other installment of the franchise.<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'' Critical Review] ''Ign.com''. URL accessed on March 27, 2006.</ref>

Another consistent aspect is that the player's rival will always choose as his or her starter, the one that has a type advantage over the player's chosen Pok<U+00E9>mon. For instance, if the player picks grass-type Bulbasaur, the rival will always pick fire-type Charmander. This does not affect the first battle between the rivals, as they can only use "normal" type attacks at this point, meaning that they cannot exploit the weaknesses. The exception to this is again ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow'', in which the rival picks a normal type Eevee. Whether this Pok<U+00E9>mon evolves into Jolteon, Flareon, or Vaporeon is decided by when the player exposes the Eevee to an elemental stone (Thunder, Fire, and Water respectively).

In the [[Super Smash Bros. (series)|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], [[Pikachu]], [[Ivysaur]], [[Squirtle]], [[Charizard]], [[Jigglypuff]], [[Pichu]], [[Mewtwo]] and [[Lucario]] are playable characters. Pikachu and Jigglypuff are introduced in ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]], and are also featured in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], alongside Pichu and Mewtwo. In ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'', Mewtwo and Pichu are not featured, although Squirtle, Ivysaur, and Charizard make their first playable appearances as part of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trainer]] character, while Lucario appears as a separate character. [[Rayquaza]] is also featured as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]] enemy. The series also features [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball]]s as items, which, when used by a player, make a random Pok<U+00E9>mon appear, with various effects on the game.

=="Unobtainable" Pok<U+00E9>mon==
[[Image:MewPKMN.png|thumb|140px|left|Mew, one of the unobtainable Pok<U+00E9>mon]]

Four Pok<U+00E9>mon, [[Mew (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Mew]], [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (241-260)#Celebi|Celebi]], [[Jirachi]], and [[Deoxys]], are extremely rare and were nearly impossible to get in the Game Boy Advance era. [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] added three new extremely rare Pok<U+00E9>mon: [[Darkrai]], [[Shaymin]], and [[Arceus]]. They are obtained by using the Mystery Gift function; in some cases, exploiting a glitch in the game itself; or directly from Nintendo at promotional events. These Pok<U+00E9>mon can be obtained by using a [[GameShark]] or similar cheating device like [[Action Replay]]. Players are not required to own these Pok<U+00E9>mon, among others, in order to have a complete [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]].

*[[Mew (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Mew]] can be found in the  ''Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' versions using the "[[#Codes and glitches|Mew glitch]]." In addition, it is possible to get an Old Sea Chart in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]'' at one of Nintendo's promotional events and use this to travel to Faraway Island (known as World's Edge Island in Japan), where Mew can be caught. On September 30, 2006, Mew was also given out at [[Toys "R" Us]] stores throughout the [[United States]]<ref>[http://www.pokemon.com/index.weml#mailbag_09252006 Mailbag: The Mystery of Mew!], ''Pok<U+00E9>mon.com''. URL last accessed March 4, 2007.</ref> in recognition of the release of the new movie, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''. A similar event at [[Toys "R" Us]] stores across Britain took place in August 2007. Several of these promotional events also took place in major shopping malls in Australia and the United States. It has also been discovered that Mew is also obtainable in the WiiWare, [[My Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranch]]. If 999 Pok<U+00E9>mon are sent to the Ranch, Hayley will bring a Mew to the Ranch and is able to be traded in return for an egg from the Wii to a Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond or Pok<U+00E9>mon Pearl game.

*[[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon (241-260)#Celebi|Celebi]] can be found through the use of the [[Pok<U+00E9> Ball#GS Ball|GS ball]] (only obtainable in the Japanese version of ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal]]'' through a cell phone network service), which can be placed in a shrine in Ilex Forest to summon it, by manipulating a glitch, or by using a cheating device. It is also available in the Japanese ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Colosseum]]'' bonus disc, which was available with pre-orders. For the ''Gold'', ''Silver'' and ''Crystal'' games, Celebi has been provided as a promotional Pok<U+00E9>mon at special events, but it was not obtainable outside of Japan for the Game Boy Advance generation with the exception of a promotional 10th Pok<U+00E9>mon Journey Across America.

*[[Jirachi]] can only be obtained legitimately with the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Colosseum]]'' bonus disc (which was available with pre-orders) in North America, which allows a player to trade this Pok<U+00E9>mon to the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. [[PAL region]] gamers can get it by finishing ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Channel]]'', after which Jirachi can be downloaded to the GBA games.

*[[Deoxys]] can be caught on Birth Island to the south of Kanto in the ''FireRed'', ''LeafGreen'', and ''Emerald'' versions, provided the player has an Aurora Ticket, which was a bonus for pre-ordering a ticket to see the 7th movie in Japan. In America, the ticket was given at Pok<U+00E9>mon Rocks America 2004 and on Halloween 2004 at the former Pok<U+00E9>mon Center. Europeans were able to find it by a promotion called "The Hunt for Deoxys." Nintendo of Europe gave out tickets to those who mailed their games in. Due to the universal encoding of a Game Boy Advance, American cartridges can receive Deoxys too. An event took place at the Houston Space Center that gave out Deoxys on March 10 through 19 of 2006. Deoxys was also given away to owners of [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as a bonus for pre-ordering a ticket to see the tenth Pok<U+00E9>mon movie. This Deoxys came in the exclusive Cherish Ball and had a unique moveset. Deoxys was also given away to Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl owners on the weekends of June 20<U+2013>22, and June 27<U+2013>29, 2008 at local [[GameStop]]s in America.

*[[Ho-Oh]] and [[Lugia]] are also relatively unobtainable in ''FireRed'', ''LeafGreen'', and ''Emerald''. The Pok<U+00E9>mon can be caught on Navel Rock to the south of Kanto if the player has a Mystic Ticket, which can obtained by using Mystery Gift near a Joyspot. Mystic Tickets were also made available to US players at the Nintendo World grand opening in New York City on May 14, 2005. When ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Colosseum]]'' was released, players could also catch Ho-Oh by Snagging and purifying all 48 Shadow Pok<U+00E9>mon and then beating Mt. Battle with an in-game team. In ''Colosseum''{{'}}s sequel, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon XD: Gale of Darkness|Pok<U+00E9>mon XD]]'', Lugia is prominently featured and can be caught within the game, then can be traded to a GBA game after purification. Ho-Oh and Lugia were also among the top ten Pok<U+00E9>mon given out in the [[Europe]]an Pok<U+00E9>mon 10th anniversary tour, held in 2006.

*[[Manaphy]] can be obtained in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' by way of the games ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]''. After each game is completed, a special mission may be offered to maintain a Manaphy egg which the player can then transfer to ''Diamond'' or ''Pearl'' to hatch there. Additionally, on Saturday, September 29, 2007, Toys 'R' Us held another event to distribute [[Manaphy]], in promotion of the movie ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]''. This particular Manaphy had a special moveset and was caught in a Cherish Ball. It also held the item Red Scarf.

*[[Darkrai]] can be obtained in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' with the use of the event item Membership Pass. This takes the player to Newmoon Island, where Darkrai can be found. Darkrai was also distributed at movie theatres in Japan to promote the movie ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: The Rise of Darkrai]]''. Keeping in trend with previous promotions, the Pok<U+00E9>mon [[Darkrai]] was distributed at Toys 'R' Us stores in the United States on May 31 and June 1, 2008, also in promotion of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon: The Rise of Darkrai''. Darkrai is also obtained by completing a mission in Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia.

*[[Shaymin]] was only obtainable in Japan on July 6 (premiere) and 19 (official date). Anyone who brought their DS with their ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' game cartridges were able to receive Shaymin anywhere in the movie hall.

===Other promotions===
Nintendo has produced modified versions of other, not so rare Pok<U+00E9>mon to serve as promotional icons. One of these was a surfing [[Pikachu]], which was originally available only through a [[Nintendo Power]] contest. However, it was later provided as an unlockable secret in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Stadium]]'', ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Box: Ruby & Sapphire|Pok<U+00E9>mon Box]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Battle Revolution]]''. Similarly, for a short time in Japan, there was a giveaway providing diving Pikachu. Flying Pikachu were also given away at Journey Across America in New York City stop.

==Codes and glitches==
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Glitch cityscrnshot.jpg|right|thumb|165px|Glitch City, one of the most noted glitches in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue]]'']] -->
There are many different glitches that can be triggered in the Pok<U+00E9>mon games, especially in the older ''Red'', ''Blue'' and ''Yellow'' versions.<ref>[http://www.trsrockin.com/tales.html MissingNo. and Glitch Pok<U+00E9>mon articles], ''TRSRockin.com'' retrieved on November 16, 2007</ref> These glitches allow players to duplicate Pok<U+00E9>mon or items, catch unobtainable Pok<U+00E9>mon, and accomplish otherwise impossible feats.

Additionally, a vast number of fake glitches and codes for the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games (again, especially for ''Red'' and ''Blue'') exist. The creation of such codes is often used to trick credulous players into deleting their save file, releasing their Pok<U+00E9>mon, or performing other supposed requirements. Many of these glitches involve the catching of unobtainable (entirely fake) Pok<U+00E9>mon; in many cases, the credibility of such codes was increased by falsified screenshots from the in-game Pok<U+00E9>dex.  Essentially all of these codes have been proven false, and since then numbers of false glitches for later games have dropped significantly. This is probably a result of the relative stability of the later games' code, which is less susceptible to the glitches that were rampant in previous versions. One of the most popular glitches found in the early Pok<U+00E9>mon games is Missingno., a strange Pok<U+00E9>mon found on the coast of Cinnabar Island. It is apparently a missing variable in the percentile odds of catching certain Pok<U+00E9>mon. If the player "catches" this glitch, it will distort many of the game's functions, such as the Hall of Fame data, although it will most likely not harm the save file. The name of your character changes what image is used for Missingno., varying from black rectangles to a fossilized skeleton of a Pok<U+00E9>mon to a level 255 Mewtwo.<ref>http://www.wikihow.com/Catch-a-MissingNo-in-Pokemon-Red-and-Blue Catching Missingno., Retrieved on March 26, 2008</ref>

Additionally, a glitch for catching the supposedly uncatchable Mew Pok<U+00E9>mon has been uncovered, in two different ways that have yet to be found to ruin the game.<ref>http://pokedex.kary.ca/catchmew.shtml How to Catch Mew Retrieved on March 26, 2008</ref> Cloning glitches have been also uncovered in several games, like at the battle tower in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]. These allow the player to duplicate Pok<U+00E9>mon by following a series of steps. By some players, however, this is considered [[cheating]]. There is also the possibility of corrupting or erasing the game file, with no way to restore it. Most glitches are banned from tournaments.

==Impact==
A subculture exists which is devoted to the study of Pok<U+00E9>mon battling and strategy, usually on research centers around Internet bulletin boards. As well, multiple methods of online Pok<U+00E9>mon battling exist, such as linkable Game Boy [[console emulator|emulator]]s, an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] channel based programs: GSBot and RSBot, as well as the independent program Pok<U+00E9>mon Netbattle, and another program called Shoddy Battle.

Guinness World Records recognized the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' series by awarding it eight world records in ''Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008''. The records include "Most Successful RPG Series of All Time", "Game Series With the Most Spin-Off Movies", and "Most Photosensitive Epileptic Seizures Caused By A TV Show".
