The '''[[1962 NFL season|1962]] [[National Football League]] championship game''' was the 30th NFL title game. The game was played on December 30, 1962 at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in [[New York city]] between [[New York Giants]] and [[Green Bay Packers]]. The attendance for the game was 64,892. The Packers were coached by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach [[Vince Lombardi]], and the Giants by [[Allie Sherman]]. The weather during the game was so cold that television crews used bonfires to thaw out their cameras, and one cameraman suffered frostbite. The conditions also made throwing the ball difficult. Green Bay won 16<U+2013>7 behind the performances of game [[Most Valuable Player]] linebacker [[Ray Nitschke]], and fullback [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]]. Green Bay right guard [[Jim Kramer]] kicked three field goals. The Giants fumbled twice, losing each, while the Packers recovered all five of their fumbles.

==Background==

The 1962 game was a rematch of the 1961 championship game, won by Green Bay 37<U+2013>0.<ref name="NYG.comchamp2">[http://www.giants.com/history/ChampionshipGames1950present.asp Championship Games 1950<U+2013>present], giants.com, accessed January 12, 2007.</ref> The Eastern Conference champions New York Giants (12-2) faced the Western Conference Green Bay Packers (13-1). Green Bay began the season 10<U+2013>0 including a 49<U+2013>0 victory over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], where they outgained Philadelphia in yards 628<U+2013>54.<ref name="ESPN"/> Before the, 10,000 fans at a [[New York Knicks]] game spontaneously began chanting "Beat Green Bay! Beat Green Bay!", and when the 18,000 tickets available to non season ticket holders went on sale for the game, they sold within three hours.<ref>Gottehrer. pg. 17</ref> Due to the NFL's [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] policy which aimed to protect gate receipts, until 1973 fans in a team's home market could not see their team's games, even if they were title games.<ref name="AP">Associated Press.

==Game summary==

The wind caused the ball to be blown off the tee three times during the opening kickoff, and a Green Bay player had to hold the ball onto the tee so [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]] could kick the ball off.<ref name="Go20"/> After a [[Jim Kramer]] field goal made the score 3<U+2013>0 in favor of Green Bay in the first quarter, the Giants drove to the Green Bay 15&nbsp;yard line behind short passes from Tittle. Tittle's play action pass to wide open tight end [[Joe Walton]] near the goal line was tipped by Nitchske and intercepted by fellow linebacker [[Dan Currie]]. During most of the first and second quarter, the teams ran the ball for short gains. Taylor was repeatedly hit hard, and suffered cuts to his arm and tongue. Near halftime, the Giants [[Phil King]] fumbled on their own 28, and Nitchke recovered. Behind a halfback pass from [[Paul Hornung]] to flanker [[Boyd Dowler]], the Packers drove to the Giants seven yard line, where Taylor used an outside fake before going back inside to run untouched into the end zone on the following play.<ref name="Go21">Gottehrer. pg. 21</ref>

The weather worsened by halftime and the wind swirled dust around the stadium, tearing apart the United States flag in the ballpark, and knocking over a television camera.<ref name="Go22"/> Passing became even more difficult; the longest pass of the day was a 25&nbsp; yard pass from Tittle to Walton.<ref name="Stern">Sternberg, Alan J. [http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/professional/a-meadowlands-super-bowl-could-be-an-nfl-and-new-jersey-debacle A Meadowlands Super Bowl could be an NFL <U+2014> and New Jersey <U+2014> debacle], newjerseynewsroom.com, May 24, 2010, accessed December 1, 2010.</ref> After blocking a Green Bay punt in the end zone and recovering it for a touchdown to pull the game to 10<U+2013>7 in the third quarter, the Giants defense forced the Packers into a three and out on their next possession. [[Sam Horner]] fumbled on a punt return at the Giants 42&nbsp;yard line however, and Nitschke recovered. Jim Kramer kicked a field goal to make the game 13<U+2013>7 five plays later. Tittle, with the aid of two Packers penalties, then drove the Giants from their own 20 to the Green Bay 18 on the ensuing drive. New York then incurred two holding penalties, pushing them back to the Packers 40&nbsp;yard line and ending their drive. Led by Taylor who repeatedly ran for key first downs, the Packers advanced the ball down to the New York end of the field, and kicked a field goal to make the score 16<U+2013>7 with 1:50 to play.<ref name="Go22">Gottehrer. pg. 22</ref> Green Bay recovered all five of their fumbles during the game, while the Giants lost both of theirs.<ref name="Go20">Gottehrer. pg. 20</ref>
