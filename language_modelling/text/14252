'''Adam Kuhn''' ([[1741]]&ndash;[[1817]]) was an American [[physician]] and [[Natural history|naturalist]], and one of the earliest professors of Medicine in a North American university.

Kuhn was born in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], son of German immigrant parents, went to [[Sweden]] and studied Medicine and Natural history 1761&ndash;1764 at [[Uppsala University]], where he was probably the only American student of [[Carolus Linnaeus]]. He continued his studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated as M.D. in 1767. Returning to America, he practiced as a physician in [[Philadelphia]] and was [[1768]]&ndash;[[1789]] professor of [[Materia medica]] and [[1789]]&ndash;[[1797]] of the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|Medical School of the College of Philadelphia]] (later the [[University of Pennsylvania]]), founded in 1765 as the first faculty of Medicine in the thirteen colonies.

[[Benjamin Rush]] wrote in his autobiography that Kuhn, after the death of Dr [[John Jones]] in June 1791, was considered the leading physician in Philadelphia and the one favored by "the principle officers of the general government". He treated "Washington Custes" ([[George Washington Custis]], the son of Washington's stepson, see [[Martha Washington]])  and functioned as the family physician of [[George Washington]]. There is, however, no evidence that he actually treated the President. (Roos, "Physicians to the Presidents", p. 301)

Kuhn was one of the founders of the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia]] in [[1787]], and became its president in [[1808]].
