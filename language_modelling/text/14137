'''Ernie Adams''' is the Football Research Director for the [[New England Patriots]] of the [[National Football League]]. He is a longtime friend of head coach [[Bill Belichick]]. With Adams, the Patriots have won three [[Super Bowl]]s. Adams is known for his eccentric personality and low profile, as well as his extremely thorough analysis of the game.<ref name="Northwestern">{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2008/feature/adams.html|title=Mystery Man|work=[[Northwestern University]]|first=Tim|last=Warren|date=Winter 2008|accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref>

==Early years==
Adams attended the [[Dexter School]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], of which [[John F. Kennedy]] is also an alumnus. Given his knowledge of football for his age, Adams was asked to coach the school's intramural football team as an eighth grader.<ref name="Globe">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/02/03/adamss_role_its_top_secret/?page=full|title=Adams's role? It's top secret|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Bob|last=Hohler|date=2008-02-03|accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref>

He later attended [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] for high school. While there, he had read ''Football Scouting Methods'' written by [[Steve Belichick]], who was then a football scout for the [[United States Naval Academy]]. In 1970, Steve Belichick's son Bill enrolled at Phillips Academy for a post-graduate year after graduating from [[Annapolis High School]]. Adams, a senior, recognized Belichick's name and the two quickly became friends.<ref name="ESPN">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=adams|title=Who is this guy?|work=[[ESPN The Magazine]]|first=Wright|last=Thompson|date=2008-01-30|accessdate=2009-12-04}}</ref> At one point, they snuck into a [[Boston College]] football practice together to practice scouting.<ref name="ESPN" />

Beginning in 1971, Adams attended [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. As a freshman, Adams sought a student assistant position for the Wildcats' football team and secured it after impressing an assistant coach with a report on a football formation.<ref name="Northwestern" /> He would serve as a scout for Northwestern until his graduation in 1975 with a degree in [[education]].<ref name="Northwestern" />

==Professional career==
===First stint with Patriots===
After his graduation from college, Adams pursued an unpaid position with the New England Patriots in 1975. After contacting then-head coach [[Chuck Fairbanks]] numerous times, Adams received a playbook from assistant coach [[Hank Bullough]] to learn; Adams learned it in two days, and was presented with another playbook, which he again learned in two days.<ref name="Globe" /> Adams was hired as an offensive and administrative assistant, and eventually prepared scouting reports for the team, which Fairbanks said were the most thorough he had received in his career.<ref name="Globe" />

===New York Giants===
In 1979, Patriots assistant [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]] was hired to be the head coach of the [[New York Giants]]. He promptly hired Adams as an offensive assistant, working with the [[quarterback]]s and receivers. Adams then convinced Perkins to hire Bill Belichick as a [[special teams]] coach; Belichick had spent the previous eight years as a student at [[Wesleyan University]] and then as an assistant coach for three NFL teams. Adams spent three seasons as the Giants' offensive assistant before moving to their scouting department as their pro personnel director.<ref name="Globe" /> By 1985, he had become frustrated with that job,<ref name="Globe" /> and took a lucrative job offer as a [[municipal bond]]s trader on [[Wall Street]].<ref name="Northwestern" />

===Cleveland Browns===
Adams left Wall Street to join the [[Cleveland Browns]] in 1991, who had just given Belichick his first NFL head coaching position. Adams was again an offensive assistant, working with [[tight end]]s and [[running back]]s.<ref name="Northwestern" /> However, Belichick was fired by the Browns in 1996, and Adams returned to Wall Street, starting his own investment business.<ref name="Northwestern" />

===Second stint with Patriots===
Belichick got his next head coaching opportunity with the Patriots in 2000. This time, Adams joined the team not as a coach, but as "Football Research Director." Adams fills a variety of roles for the team. On gamedays, he assists the coaching staff from the press box, advising Belichick on which plays to issue a replay challenge.<ref name="Northwestern" /> He also assists the scouting department in preparing for the [[NFL Draft]] in the spring, and builds the team's player value chart for the draft.<ref name="Northwestern" /> Finally, Adams works on special assignments for the coaching and scouting staffs, which typically involve breaking down game tape.<ref name="Northwestern" /> In 2007, as part of [[Spygate]], it was revealed that Adams received tapes from a "third camera" that recorded opponents' defensive signals against league rules, and studied them to learn the signals. Belichick confirmed this was the case, but said that they were only a small part of the "mosaic" that were the Patriots' offensive game plans at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/05/bill_belichicks.html|title=Bill Belichick complete CBS News interview transcript|work=Boston.com Reiss' Pieces|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-05-17|accessdate=2008-05-17}}</ref>

Adams (and Belichick) have also been known to have an interest in mathematical analyses of football; Adams once contacted [[Rutgers University]] statistics professor Harold Sackrowitz, asking him to evaluate the Patriots' two-point conversion chart following a study by Sackrowitz on the decision.<ref name="Globe" /><ref name="ESPN" /> Adams also presented Belichick with a study concluding teams punt too often on fourth down.<ref name="ESPN" />

With the Patriots and throughout his career, Adams is known for keeping a low profile. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] notably quipped "I'll pay anyone here $10,000 if they can tell me what Ernie Adams does."<ref name="Globe" />
