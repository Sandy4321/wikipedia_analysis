The bacterium can be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years.

''E. coli'' and related bacteria possess the ability to transfer [[DNA]] via [[bacterial conjugation]], [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]] or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]], which allows genetic material to [[Horizontal gene transfer|spread horizontally]] through an existing population.

==Diversity==
''Escherichia coli'' encompasses an enormous population of bacteria that exhibit a very high degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing of a large number of isolates of ''E. coli'' and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=N. R. |editor1-last=Krieg |editor2-first=J. G. |editor2-last=Holt |title=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology |edition=First |volume=1 |publisher=The Williams & Wilkins Co |location=Baltimore |year=1984 |pages=408<U+2013>420 |isbn=0-683-04108-8 }}</ref> and ''E. coli'' remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of the genome is common to all strains.<ref name="comparison">{{cite journal | author = Lukjancenko O, Wassenaar TM, Ussery DW | title = Comparison of 61 sequenced Escherichia coli genomes | journal = Microb.

In fact, from the evolutionary point of view, the members of genus ''[[Shigella]]'' (''S. dysenteriae'', ''S. flexneri'', ''S. boydii'', ''S. sonnei'') should be classified as ''E. coli'' strains, a phenomenon termed [[taxa in disguise]].<ref name="pmid12361912">{{cite journal | author = Lan R, Reeves PR | title = Escherichia coli in disguise: molecular origins of Shigella | journal = Microbes Infect. | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = 1125<U+2013>32 |date=September 2002 | pmid = 12361912 | doi = 10.1016/S1286-4579(02)01637-4 }}</ref> Similarly, other strains of ''E. coli'' (e.g. the K-12 strain commonly used in [[recombinant DNA]] work) are sufficiently different that they would merit reclassification.

A [[strain (biology)|strain]] is a sub-group within the species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain [[pathogenicity|pathogenic capacity]], the ability to use a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular [[ecological niche]] or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of ''E. coli'' are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples.<ref name=Feng_2002/><ref name=Thompson/> For example, knowing which ''E. coli'' strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another [[mammal]] or a [[bird]].

===Serotypes===
{{main|Pathogenic Escherichia coli#Serotypes}}
A common subdivision system of ''E. coli'', but not based on evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, which is based on major surface antigens (O antigen: part of [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer; H: [[flagellin]]; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7).<ref name="pmid334154">{{cite journal | author = Orskov I, Orskov F, Jann B, Jann K | title = Serology, chemistry, and genetics of O and K antigens of Escherichia coli | journal = Bacteriol Rev | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 667<U+2013>710 |date=September 1977 | pmid = 334154 | pmc = 414020 | doi = }}</ref> It is however common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen.

===Genome plasticity===
Like all lifeforms, new strains of ''E. coli'' [[evolution|evolve]] through the natural biological processes of [[mutation]], [[gene duplication]] and [[horizontal gene transfer]], in particular 18% of the genome of the [[Escherichia coli (molecular biology)|laboratory strain MG1655]] was horizontally acquired since the divergence from ''Salmonella''.<ref name="pmid9689094">{{cite journal | author = Lawrence JG, Ochman H | title = Molecular archaeology of the Escherichia coli genome | journal = Proc.

===Neotype strain===
''E. coli'' is the type species of the genus (''Escherichia'') and in turn ''Escherichia'' is the type genus of the family ''Enterobacteriaceae'', where it should be noted that the family name does not stem from the genus ''Enterobacter'' + "i" (sic.) + "[[Bacterial taxonomy|aceae]]", but from "enterobacterium" + "aceae" (enterobacterium being not a genus, but an alternative trivial name to enteric bacterium).<ref name=Bergey2B/><ref>{{lpsn|e/enterobacteriaceae|Discussion of nomenclature of Enterobacteriaceae}}</ref><ref>International Bulletin of Bacteriological Nomenclature and Taxonomy 8:73<U+2013>74 (1958)<!--PDF is easily findable...--></ref>

The original strain described by Escherich is believed to be lost, consequently a new type strain (neotype) was chosen as a representative: the neotype strain is [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC 11775]],<ref>http://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx?ATCCNum=11775&Template=bacteria</ref> also known as NCTC 9001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/e/escherichia.html|title=Escherichia|publisher=bacterio.cict.fr}}</ref> which is pathogenic to chickens and has an O1:K1:H7 serotype.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcm.riken.go.jp/cgi-bin/jcm/jcm_number?JCM=1649 |title=Escherichia coli (Migula 1895) Castellani and Chalmers 1919 |work=JCM Catalogue |date= }}</ref> However, in most studies either O157:H7 or K-12 MG1655 or K-12 W3110 are used as a representative ''E.coli''.

===Phylogeny of ''Escherichia coli'' strains===
A large number of strains belonging to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their [[phylogeny]], i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups.<ref name="comparison">{{cite journal | author = Sims GE, Kim SH | title = Whole-genome phylogeny of Escherichia coli/Shigella group by feature frequency profiles (FFPs) | journal = Proc.

The link between phylogenetic distance ("relatedness") and pathology is small, ''e.g.'' the O157:H7 serotype strains, which form a [[clade]] ("an exclusive group")<U+2014>group E below<U+2014>are all enterohaemorragic strains (EHEC), but not all EHEC strains are closely related. In fact, four different species of ''Shigella'' are nested among ''E. coli'' strains (vide supra), while ''Escherichia albertii'' and ''Escherichia fergusonii'' are outside of this group. All commonly used [[Escherichia coli (molecular biology)|research strains]] of ''E. coli'' belong to group A and are derived mainly from Clifton's K-12 strain (<U+03BB><U+207A> F<U+207A>; O16) and to a lesser degree from [[F<U+00E9>lix d'Herelle|d'Herelle]]'s ''[[Bacillus coli]]'' strain (B strain)(O7).

==Genomics==
The first complete [[DNA sequence]] of an ''E. coli'' [[genome]] (laboratory strain K-12 derivative MG1655) was published in 1997. It was found to be a circular [[DNA]] molecule 4.6 million [[base pair]]s in length, containing 4288 annotated protein-coding genes (organized into 2584 [[operons]]), seven [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) operons, and 86 [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) genes. Despite having been the subject of intensive genetic analysis for approximately 40 years, a large number of these genes were previously unknown. The coding density was found to be very high, with a mean distance between genes of only 118 base pairs. The genome was observed to contain a significant number of [[transposon|transposable genetic elements]], repeat elements, cryptic [[prophages]], and [[bacteriophage]] remnants.<ref name="pmid9278503">{{cite journal | author = Blattner FR, Plunkett G, Bloch CA, Perna NT, Burland V, Riley M, Collado-Vides J, Glasner JD, Rode CK, Mayhew GF, Gregor J, Davis NW, Kirkpatrick HA, Goeden MA, Rose DJ, Mau B, Shao Y | title = The complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli K-12 | journal = Science | volume = 277 | issue = 5331 | pages = 1453<U+2013>62 |date=September 1997 | pmid = 9278503 | doi = 10.1126/science.277.5331.1453 }}</ref>

Today, over 60 complete genomic sequences of ''Escherichia'' and ''Shigella'' species are available. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while approximately 80% of each genome can vary among isolates.<ref name="comparison" /> Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pan-genome) exceeds 16,000.

==Role in disease==
{{main|Pathogenic Escherichia coli}}
Virulent strains of ''E. coli'' can cause [[gastroenteritis]], [[urinary tract infection]]s, and [[neonatal]] [[meningitis]]. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]], [[peritonitis]], [[mastitis]], [[septicemia]] and Gram-negative [[pneumonia]].<ref name=Todar/>

UPEC (uropathogenic ''E. coli'') is one of the main causes of [[urinary tract infection]]s.<ref name=pre-eminent>{{cite web|title=Uropathogenic Escherichia coli: The Pre-Eminent Urinary Tract Infection Pathogen|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=25500&osCsid=3712df5600f98259a8bdc1d9baf202e9|publisher=Nova publishers|accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref>  It is part of the normal flora in the gut and can be introduced in many ways. In particular for females, the direction of wiping after defecation (wiping back to front) can lead to fecal contamination of the urogenital orifices.

In May 2011, one ''E. coli'' strain, [[E. coli O104:H4|''Escherichia coli'' O104:H4]], has been the subject of a [[2011 E. coli O104:H4 outbreak|bacterial outbreak]] that began in [[Germany]]. Certain strains of ''E. coli'' are a major cause of [[foodborne illness]]. The outbreak started when several people in Germany were infected with [[enterohemorrhagic E. coli|enterohemorrhagic ''E. coli'' (EHEC)]] bacteria, leading to [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] (HUS), a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment. The outbreak did not only concern Germany, but 11 other countries, including regions in North America.<ref>[http://www.sgs.com/en/Our-Company/News-and-Media-Center/News-and-Press-Releases/2011/06/Enterohemorrhagic-Escherichia-Coli-EHEC-outbreak-in-Germany.aspx Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia Coli (EHEC) outbreak in Germany]</ref> On 30 June 2011 the German ''Bundesinstitut f<U+00FC>r Risikobewertung (BfR)'' (''Federal Institute for Risk Assessment'', a federal, fully legal entity under public law of the Federal Republic of Germany, an institute within the German [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]]) announced that seeds of [[fenugreek]] from [[Egypt]] were likely the cause of the EHEC outbreak.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bfr.bund.de/cm/343/samen_von_bockshornklee_mit_hoher_wahrscheinlichkeit_fuer_ehec_o104_h4_ausbruch_verantwortlich.pdf|title = Samen von Bockshornklee mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit f<U+00FC>r EHEC O104:H4 Ausbruch verantwortlich ''in English: Fenugreek seeds with high probability for EHEC O104: H4 responsible outbreak''|date = 30 June 2011|publisher = Bundesinstitut f<U+00FC>r Risikobewertung (BfR) ''in English: Federal Institute for Risk Assessment''|language = German|format= PDF|accessdate = 17 July 2011}}</ref>

''E. coli'' is a very versatile host for the production of [[heterologous]] [[protein]]s,<ref name=Cornelis/> and various [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|protein expression]] systems have been developed which allow the production of [[recombinant proteins]] in ''E. coli''. Researchers can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids which permit high level expression of protein, and such protein may be mass-produced in [[industrial fermentation]] processes. One of the first useful applications of [[recombinant DNA]] technology was the manipulation of ''E. coli'' to produce human [[insulin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm |title=Recombinant DNA Technology in the Synthesis of Human Insulin |accessdate=2007-11-30 |last=Tof |first=Ilanit |coauthors= |year=1994 |work= |publisher=Little Tree Pty.

''E. coli'' is frequently used as a [[model organism]] in [[microbiology]] studies.

The [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|long-term evolution experiments using ''E. coli'']], begun by [[Richard Lenski]] in 1988, have allowed direct observation of major evolutionary shifts in the laboratory.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.html Bacteria make major evolutionary shift in the lab] ''New Scientist''</ref> In this experiment, one population of ''E. coli'' unexpectedly evolved the ability to aerobically metabolize [[citrate]], which is extremely rare in ''E. coli''. As the inability to grow aerobically is normally used as a diagnostic criterion with which to differentiate ''E. coli'' from other, closely related bacteria, such as ''[[Salmonella]]'', this innovation may mark a [[speciation]] event observed in the lab.

By evaluating the possible combination of [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]] with [[landscape ecology]], complex habitat landscapes can be generated with details at the nanoscale.<ref name="pmid17090676">{{cite journal | author = Keymer JE, Galajda P, Muldoon C, Park S, Austin RH | title = Bacterial metapopulations in nanofabricated landscapes | journal = Proc.

==History==
The genera ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' diverged around 102 million years ago (credibility interval: 57<U+2013>176&nbsp;mya), which coincides with the divergence of their hosts: the former being found in mammals and the latter in birds and reptiles.<ref name="pmid15535883">{{cite journal |author = Battistuzzi FU, Feijao A, Hedges SB | title = A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land | journal = BMC Evol.

In 1885, a German pediatrician, [[Theodor Escherich]], discovered this organism in the feces of healthy individuals and called it ''Bacterium coli commune'' due to the fact it is found in the colon and early classifications of Prokaryotes placed these in a handful of genera based on their shape and motility (at that time [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s classification of Bacteria in the kingdom [[Monera]] was in place<ref>{{cite book

Following a revision of ''Bacterium'' it was reclassified as ''Bacillus coli'' by Migula in 1895<ref>MIGULA (W.): Bacteriaceae (Stabchenbacterien). In: A. ENGLER and K.

The genus belongs in a group of bacteria informally known as "[[coliforms]]", and is a member of the [[Enterobacteriaceae]] family ("the enterics") of the [[Gammaproteobacteria]].<ref name=Bergey2B>{{cite book |series=Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology|volume=2B|title=The Gammaproteobacteria|editor=George M.
