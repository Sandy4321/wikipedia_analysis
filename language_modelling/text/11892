The '''1910 London to Manchester air race''' took place between two aviators, who each attempted to win a heavier-than-air powered [[Air racing|flight challenge]] between [[London]] and [[Manchester]], first proposed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper in 1906.  The <U+00A3>10,000 prize was won in April 1910 by Frenchman [[Louis Paulhan]].

The first person to make the attempt was [[Claude Grahame-White]], an Englishman from [[Hampshire]].  He took off from London on 23&nbsp;April 1910, and made his first planned stop at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]].  His biplane later suffered engine problems and he was forced to land again, near [[Lichfield]].  High winds meant that continuing his journey was impossible, and he gave up his attempt.  His aeroplane suffered further damage while grounded, when the winds blew it over.

While Grahame-White's aeroplane was being repaired in London, late on 27&nbsp;April Paulhan began his attempt, heading for Lichfield.  A few hours later Graham-White was made aware of Paulhan's take-off, and immediately set off in pursuit.  The next morning, after making an unprecedented night-time take-off, he almost caught up with Paulhan, but his aeroplane was overweight and he was forced to concede defeat.  Paulhan reached Manchester early on 28&nbsp;April, winning the challenge.  Both aviators celebrated his victory during a special luncheon, held at the Savoy Hotel in London.

The event marked the first long-distance aeroplane race in England, the first flight of a heavier-than-air machine at night, and the first powered flight into Manchester from outside the city.  Paulhan later repeated the journey in April 1950, the fortieth anniversary of the original flight, this time as a passenger aboard a British jet fighter.

==History==
On 17&nbsp;November 1906 the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper offered a <U+00A3>10,000 prize for the first aviator to fly the {{convert|185|mi}} between [[London]] and [[Manchester]], with no more than two stops, in under 24&nbsp;hours.<ref name="Flight5April1913"/>  The challenge also specified that take-off and landing were to be at locations no more than five miles away from the newspaper's offices in those cities.<!-- the 5-mile specification is not cited here, but elsewhere in the article --><ref name="Claxtonpp7273">{{Harvnb|Claxton|2007|pp=72<U+2013>73}}</ref>  Powered flight was a relatively new invention, and the newspaper's proprietors [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|were keen to stimulate the industry's growth]]; in 1908 they offered <U+00A3>1,000 for the first flight across the [[English channel]] (won on 25&nbsp;July 1909 by the French aviator [[Louis Bl<U+00E9>riot]]), and <U+00A3>1,000 for the first circular one-mile flight made by a British aviator in a British aeroplane (won on 30&nbsp;October 1909 by the English aviator [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara|John Moore-Brabazon]]).<ref name="Flight5April1913">{{Citation | title = The New ''Daily Mail'' Prizes | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1913/1913%20-%200387.html | publisher = ''Flight'', hosted at flightglobal.com | page = 393 | date = 5&nbsp;April 1913 | accessdate = 20&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref>  In 1910, two men accepted the newspaper's 1906 challenge; an Englishman, [[Claude Grahame-White]], and a Frenchman, [[Louis Paulhan]].<ref name="Claxtonpp7273"/>

Claude Grahame-White was born in 1879 in [[Hampshire]], England.  He was educated at Crondall House School in [[Farnham]], and later [[Bedford Grammar School]].  Apprenticed to a local engineering firm, he later worked for his uncle [[Francis Willey, 1st Baron Barnby]].  He started his own motor vehicle business in [[Bradford]], before travelling to [[South Africa]] to hunt big game.  In 1909, inspired by Bl<U+00E9>riot's historic cross-channel flight, he went to France and learnt how to fly, and by the following January had become one of the [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the A<U+00E9>ro-Club de France in 1909|first Englishmen]] to obtain an [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the A<U+00E9>ro-Club de France in 1910|aviator's certificate]].

===Grahame-White's first attempt===
[[File:Claude grahame-white on aeroplane.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=monochrome photograph of a young man|[[Claude Grahame-White]] (undated)]]
Grahame-White was the first to attempt the journey.  He planned to take off at 5:00&nbsp;am on 23&nbsp;April 1910, near the Plumes Hotel in the London suburb of [[Park Royal]].  A crowd of journalists and interested spectators had assembled there from about 4:00&nbsp;am, with more arriving by car, until about 200<U+2013>300 were present.  ''The Times'' described the sky as "clear and starlit", and the weather as "very cold, as there was a slight frost."  Grahame-White arrived at about 4:30&nbsp;am and began to prepare his [[Farman III]] [[biplane]].<!-- Farman III according to [http://acepilots.com/airplanes/purpose/civilian/farman-iii/], but the Times says just Farman -->  The aeroplane was brought into the field from the yard it had been stored in, and its seven-cylinder 50&nbsp;hp [[rotary engine]] was started.  Once the engine had warmed up, Grahame-White took his seat.  Several people wished him well, including his sister and mother, and [[Henry Farman]].  The pilot guided the biplane for about 30<U+2013>60&nbsp;yards across the frosted grass, and took off at about 5:12&nbsp;am,{{#tag:ref|''Flight'' magazine estimated the time as 5:15&nbsp;am.<ref name="Flight30April"/>|group="nb"}} before altering his direction to head for the start of the course<U+2014>a [[Gas holder|gasometer]] at [[Wormwood Scrubs]], within the required five-mile radius of the ''Daily Mail'' office in London.<ref name="Claxtonpp7273"/><ref name="Flight30April">{{Citation | title = The London-Manchester <U+00A3>10,000 flight prize | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200328.html | publisher = ''Flight'', hosted at flightglobal.com | page = 326 | date = 30&nbsp;April 1910 | accessdate = 19&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref><ref name="Times25April">{{Citation | title = Flight by Aeroplane {{subscription required}} | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/103/704/113492657w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS151190169&dyn=4!zoom_2?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''The Times'' hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 25&nbsp;April 1910 | page = 9 | issue = 39255 | column = A}}</ref>

Cheered loudly by the thousands of spectators who had anticipated his arrival, Grahame-White flew across the starting point and turned north-west toward [[Wembley]].  The secretary of the [[Royal Aero Club]], [[Harold Perrin]], was stood on top of the gasometer, and waved a flag to indicate the start of the challenge.  By 5:35&nbsp;am Grahame-White was over [[Watford]], and at 6:15&nbsp;am he  flew over [[Leighton Buzzard]].  He was greeted by crowds of cheering spectators as he flew above the line of the [[London and North Western Railway]], at an altitude of about {{convert|400|ft}}.  Meanwhile, Perrin and two mechanics from [[Gnome et Rh<U+00F4>ne]] (who supplied the engine used on the Farman III) had boarded one of two cars, and were headed for [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]].  Along the way, one car took a short cut across a field and crashed into a ridge; one occupant was seriously injured.<ref name="Flight30April"/><ref name="Times25April"/>

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | quote = He was reported to be 'blue with cold and [he] walked rather painfully for a few moments.  He tried to smile in answer to the cheers with which he was greeted.  His hands were numbed and his teeth were chattering.  He asked for food and a fire, saying "I am starving".  Lady Denbigh, who was present with Lord Denbigh, lent him her muff, and another lady put some furs round his neck.' | source = ''The Times'' (1910), reporting on Grahame-White's condition upon landing at Rugby.<ref name="Times25April"/> | align = left | width = 33%}}
Grahame-White made his first stop in Rugby just after 7:15&nbsp;am.  One of the cars that left London had arrived about 10&nbsp;minutes before he landed, and his mechanics attended to his aeroplane.  News of his take-off in London had reached the area, and a large crowd had gathered; they were kept from the aeroplane by a group of [[scouting|boy scouts]].  Grahame-White was taken to nearby Gellings Farm, where he drank coffee and ate biscuits, and told those present about his journey.<ref name="Flight30April"/>  "It was wretchedly cold all the way&nbsp;... and I was cold at the start.  My eyes suffered towards the end, and my fingers were quite numbed."  Grahame-White's average speed was estimated at more than {{convert|40|mph}}.  Some of the vehicles which had followed him from London did not arrive until some time after his descent.<ref name="Times25April"/>

He took off at about 8:25&nbsp;am, but was unable to reach the next scheduled stop at [[Crewe]].  About 30&nbsp;miles outside Rugby a problem with the engine's inlet valves forced him to land in a field at [[Hademore]], four&nbsp;miles outside of [[Lichfield]]<U+2014>about 115&nbsp;miles into the 185-mile journey.  On landing, he damaged a skid, and his mechanics were [[telegraphy|telegraphed]] for.  While the necessary repairs were being made, Grahame-White ate lunch and then slept for a few hours, looked after by his mother, who had arrived by car.  Meanwhile a large crowd of interested spectators had gathered, and the farmer who owned the field charged them for admission.  Soldiers from a nearby barracks kept the public from getting too close to the biplane.<ref name="Times25April"/>

As the sun fell the wind grew in strength, and at 7:00&nbsp;pm Grahame-White conceded that the high winds made any further progress impossible.  He decided to try again at 3:00&nbsp;am, hoping to reach Manchester by the 5:15&nbsp;am deadline, but at 3:30&nbsp;am he abandoned the attempt, and said that he would travel to Manchester and try again from there.  He ordered the soldiers to peg the aeroplane down, but his instructions were ignored; the next night it was blown over by strong winds and severely damaged.<ref name="Flight30Aprilpage327">{{Citation | title = The London-Manchester <U+00A3>10,000 flight prize | page = 327 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200329.html | publisher = ''Flight'', hosted at flightglobal.com | date = 30&nbsp;April 1910 | accessdate = 19&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref><ref name="Times25April"/>

===Paulhan's attempt===

Grahame-White's biplane was returned to London, and on 25&nbsp;April was being repaired at Wormwood Scrubs, in the ''Daily Mail'''s hangar.

Grahame-White had attempted to make a test flight earlier that day, but the huge crowds had hampered his efforts, and he was unable to take off.  Having spent two days supervising the reconstruction of his aeroplane, he retired to a nearby hotel.  At about 6:10&nbsp;pm he was awakened with the news that Paulhan had begun his attempt, and he decided to set off in pursuit.  This time he had no trouble clearing a space in the crowd.<ref name="Flight7Mayp351"/>  His biplane's engine was started, and by 6:29&nbsp;pm he had passed the starting line.  Almost an hour later he flew over Leighton Buzzard, just as Paulhan was passing over Rugby.  As night approached, Grahame-White landed his aeroplane in a field near the railway line at [[Roade]], in [[Northamptonshire]].<ref name="Claxtonp73">{{Harvnb|Claxton|2007|p=73}}</ref><ref name="Flight30Aprilpage328">{{Citation | title = The London-Manchester <U+00A3>10,000 flight prize | page = 328 | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200330.html | publisher = ''Flight'', hosted at flightglobal.com | date = 30&nbsp;April 1910 | accessdate = 19&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref>  Fifteen&nbsp;minutes later, Paulhan reached [[Lichfield]], where about {{convert|117|mi}} into his journey  he ran out of fuel.

Still about {{convert|60|mi}} behind the Frenchman, Grahame-White made a historic decision; he would make an unprecedented night flight.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|2001|p=85}}</ref>  Guided by the headlamps of his party's cars, he took off at 2:50&nbsp;am.

==Legacy==
The events of 27<U+2013>28&nbsp;April constituted the world's first long-distance air race, and also marked the first night flight of a heavier-than-air machine; Grahame-White's decision proved that night-time take-off, flight and navigation were possible, provided that the pilot was able to relate his position to the ground.  Grahame-White did this with the help of friends, one of whom shone his car's headlamps onto the wall of a public house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|2001|p=86}}</ref>  Paulhan's arrival in Didsbury was notable for being the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city.  His achievement is commemorated by a [[blue plaque]], fixed to the front wall of a 1930s semi-detached house in Paulhan Road, near the site of his landing.<ref name="Scholefieldp211"/>

Within weeks of Paulhan's victory, the ''Daily Mail'' offered a new prize; <U+00A3>10,000 to the first aviator to cover a 1,000-mile (1,609-km) circuit of Britain in a single day, with 11&nbsp;compulsory stops at fixed intervals.  The challenge was completed by M Beaumont on 26&nbsp;July 1911, in about 22<U+00BD> hours.  Paulhan and Grahame-White competed again later in 1910, for the newspaper's prize of <U+00A3>1,000 for the greatest aggregate cross-country flight, which Paulhan won.<ref name="Flight5April1913"/>

The flight's 25th anniversary was celebrated at the Aero Club of France, in Paris, on 16&nbsp;January 1936.  Present at the banquet were Paulhan and Grahame-White, along with the French Air Minister [[Victor Denain]], [[Berthold, Margrave of Baden|Prince Berthold of Sweden]], Harold Perrin, and a number of other notable dignitaries.<ref>{{Citation | title = A Flight that Lives | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%200204.html | publisher = ''Flight'', hosted at flightglobal.com | date = 23&nbsp;January 1936 | page = 90 | accessdate = 19&nbsp;May 2010}}</ref>

Although by then retired from flying, on 28&nbsp;April 1950<U+2014>the fortieth anniversary of the 1910 flight<U+2014>Paulhan repeated the journey from London to Manchester, this time as a passenger on board a [[Gloster Meteor]] T7, the two-seater training variant of the first British jet fighter.  After travelling at 400&nbsp;mph (644&nbsp;km/h), the 67-year-old Frenchman said "''C'<U+00E9>tait magnifique''&nbsp;... It was all I ever dreamed of in aviation<U+2014>no propellers, no vibration."  The ''Daily Mail'' entertained him at the Royal Aero Club in London, where he was accompanied by his former rival, Claude Grahame-White.<ref>{{Citation | title = 1910 Prizewinner Flies Again {{subscription required}} | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/728/79/76360048w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS50547356&dyn=10!zoom_3?sw_aep=mclib | publisher = ''The Times'', hosted at infotrac.galegroup.com | date = 28&nbsp;April 1950 | page = 3 | issue = 51677 | column = A}}</ref>
