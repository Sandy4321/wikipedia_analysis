[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] and people of Puerto Rican descent have participated as members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] in every conflict in which the United States has been involved since [[World War I]]. One of the consequences of the [[Spanish-American War]] was that Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States in accordance to the terms of the [[1898 Treaty of Paris|Treaty of Paris of 1898]], ratified on December 10, 1898. On January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico (On May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to "Puerto Rico").<ref name=Dinwiddie_p261> {{harvnb|Dinwiddie|1899|p=261}}</ref> Puerto Ricans became [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] as a result of the 1917 [[Jones-Shafroth Act]] and those who were eligible were expected to serve in the military. Puerto Ricans who resided in the island were assigned to the "Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry", organized on June 30, 1901. Those who resided in the mainland served in regular units of one of the following branches of the United States military, the [[United States Marine Corps]], [[United States Army|Army]] or the [[United States Navy|Navy]]. As such, they were assigned to regular military units, while Puerto Ricans of African descent were assigned to segrated all-black units and were subject to the discrimination which was rampant in the U.S. in those days.<ref>[http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/integrate/CHRON3.html A CHRONOLOGY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MILITARY SERVICE From WWI through WWII]</ref>

==The Porto Rico Regiment==
[[Image:OfficerStaffPortoRicoRegiment.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Officer Staff of the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry (c.1906)]]
Puerto Rico became a [[United States Territories|U.S. Territory]] in accordance to the [[1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish-American War]]. The United States appointed a military governor and soon the United States Army established itself in San Juan. The Army Appropriation Bill created by an Act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on March 2, 1889 authorized the creation of the first body of native troops in Puerto Rico. On June 30, 1901, the "Porto Rico Provisional Regiment of Infantry" was organized. On July 1, 1901, the [[United States Senate]] passed a Bill which would require a strict mental and physical examination for those who wanted to join the Regiment. It also approved the recruitment of native Puerto Rican civilians to be appointed the grade of [[Second Lieutenant]]s for a term of four years if they passed the required tests.<ref name="PRR">[http://www.valerosos.com/65thpg1.htm Puerto Rico's 65th Infantry]</ref> An Act of Congress, approved on May 27, 1908, reorganized the regiment as part of the "regular" Army. Since the native Puerto Rican officers where Puerto Rican citizens and not citizens of the United States, they were required to undergo a new physical examination to determine their fitness for commissions in the Regular Army and to take an oath of U.S. citizenship with their new officers oath.<ref name="HMPR">"Historia Militar de Puerto Rico"; by [[H<U+00E9>ctor Andr<U+00E9>s Negroni]]; pg. 370; ISBN 84-7888-138-7</ref>
==Camp Las Casas==
[[File:Curtiss C-3 USMC CulebraPR 1913 NAN8-87.jpg|thumb|left|The first USMC plane: a Curtiss C-3 in Culebra, Puerto Rico.]]
There were many military instalations in Puerto Rico, however Camp Lasa Casas played an instrumental role in preparing the native Puerto Ricans for the military. On January 30, 1908, the "Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry" was stationed at Las Casas Camp in [[Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]] a section of San Juan in what is now [[Residencial Las Casas|El Residencial Las Casas]], a public housing complex. Camp Las Casas served as the main training camp for the Puerto Rican soldiers prior to World War I, the majority of the men trained in this facility were assigned to the "Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry". Captain [[Luis R. Esteves]], who on June 19, 1915, became the first Hispanic to graduate from the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point), organized the 23rd Battalion which was composed of Puerto Ricans

Marine aviation was fairly new, it came into existence on May 22, 1912, and the first major expansion of the Marine Corps' air component, of which Puerto Rico played a major rule, came with America's entrance into World War I. On January 6, 1914, First Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith established the Marine Section of the Navy Flying School in the island municipal  [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]].<ref name="Condon">{{cite web| last = Condon| first = John Pomeroy | year = 1993| url = http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/mca-m.html| title = U.S. Marine Corps Aviation| work = 75th Year of Naval Aviation - Volume Five of a Commemorative Collection| pages = 3| publisher = History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps| language = English| accessdate=2007-01-29}}</ref>  As the number of Marine Aviators grew so did the avid desire to separate from [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviation]].<ref name=Corum_p23>[[#Corum|Corum]] (2003), p.23.</ref>  By doing so, the Marine Aviation  was designated as separate from the United States Naval Aviation.

In addition several local militia units called "Home Guard" units were organized in various cities aand towns to defend and maintain domestic order in the island. [[Virgil R.

==First shot of World War I fired<br/><small>"The Odenwald incident"</small>==
[[Image:CartuchoCasing3.jpg|150px|right|thumb|<small>Casing of the shell fired at the Odenwald </small>]]
Lt. [[Teofilo Marxuach]]'s unit of the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was stationed at [[El Morro Castle]], (then an Army base called Fort Brooke) at San Juan Bay. The United States tried to remain neutral when World War I broke out in August 1914. However [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] insisted on its neutral right to send ships without them being attacked by German submarines. The American ships carried food and raw materials to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. On March 21, 1915, Lt. Marxuach was the officer of the day at El Morro Castle.  The ''Odenwald'', built in 1903 (not to be confused with the German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German [[submarine]]s waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Lt. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnacion Correa then manned a machine gun and opened fire with little effect. <ref name="HMPR"/> Marxuach then ordered a cannon located at the Santa Rosa battery to fire a warning shot, forcing the ''Odenwald'' to stop and to return to port where its supplies were confiscated.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news

Marxuach's actions became an international incident when the German Government accused the United States Government of the holding the Odenwald illegally against its will without firing the customary warning shot as required by international law. The United States Government responded that the official report of the [[United States War Department]] made by the commander of the fortress of El Morro Castle, Lt. Col. Burnham, made it clear that only warning shots were made and that none were aimed at the Odenwald.<ref name="NYT"/>  
Eventually, the Odenwald was refitted and renamed ''SS Newport'' by the U.S. Government and assigned to the U.S. Shipping Board, where it served until 1924 when it was retired.<ref>[http://www.csg2.navy.mil/Newport%20News/newportnews.htm Newport News]</ref> In 1917 the Germans resumed submarine attacks, knowing that it would lead to America's entry into the war. 
==The United States officially declares war==
On April 6, 1917, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] declared war on Germany. By May 3, the Regiment recruited 1,969 men and the 295th and 296 Infantry Regiments of Puerto Rico were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houseofpuertorico.com/articles/PR-A_Commonwealth.htm |title= First US Shot of World War I in Puerto Rico|accessdate=October 10 2006 |dateformat=mdy |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= }}</ref>  On [[May 17]], the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was sent to guard the [[Panama Canal]] in defense of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and other vital military installations while the other Puerto Rican regiments guarded Puerto Rico.

In [[New York]], many Puerto Ricans joined the 396th Infantry Regiment which was mostly composed of [[Afro-Americans]]. They were not allowed to fight alongside their white counterparts; however, they were permitted to fight as members of a French unit in French uniforms. They fought along the [[Western Front]] in [[France]], and their reputation earned them the nickname of "the Harlem Hell Fighters" by the [[German Empire|German]]s. Among them was [[Rafael Hernandez Marin]], considered by many as Puerto Rico's greatest composer. In 1917, Rafael Hern<U+00E1>ndez was working as a musician in [[North Carolina]], when the [[United States|U.S.]] entered [[World War I]]. The [[Jazz]] bandleader [[James Reese Europe]] recruited brothers Rafael and Jes<U+00FA>s Hern<U+00E1>ndez, and 16 more Puerto Ricans to join the [[United States Army]]'s Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. He enlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment (formerly known as the 15th Infantry Regiment, New York National Guard, created in New York City June 2, 1913). The regiment, was nicknamed "The Harlem Hell Fighters" by the [[German people|Germans]], served in [[France]]. Hernandez toured [[Europe]] with the Orchestra Europe. The 396th was awarded [[French Croix de Guerre]] for battlefield gallantry by the French President. 

[[Pedro Albizu Campos]] was another renowned Puerto Rican who volunteered in the United States [[Infantry]]. Albizu was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Army Reserves and sent to the City of [[Ponce]] where he organized the town's ''Home Guard''. He was called to serve in the regular Army and sent to Camp Las Casas for further training. Upon completing the training, he was assigned to the 375th Infantry Regiment, an [[African-American]] unit. Albizu was honorably discharged from the Army in 1919, with the rank of First Lieutenant. During the time that he served he was exposed to the [[racism]] of the day which left a mark in his beliefs towards the relationship of Puerto Ricans and the United State.<ref name="HMPR">{{cite book

==Notable Puerto Ricans in combat==
One Puerto Rican who distinguished himself in combat during World War I was Lieutenant [[Frederick Lois Riefkohl]] of the US Navy. On August 2, 1917, Riefkohl, a native of the town of [[Maunabo, Puerto Rico|Maunabo]], became the frist Puerto Rican to be awarded the [[Puerto Rican recipients of the Navy Cross|Navy Cross]]. The Navy Cross, which is the second highest medal after the Medal of Honor, that can be awarded by the U.S. Navy, was awarded to Lt. Riefkohl for his actions in an engagement with an enemy submarine. Lt. Riefkohl, who was also the first Puerto Rican to graduate from the United States Naval Academy, served as a Rear Admiral in World War II.<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/valor/1_Citations/01_wwi-nc/nc_02_WW1_Navy-SUB.html Riefkohl's Navy Cross Citation]</ref> His citation reads as follows:

First Lieutenant [[Felix Rigau Carrera]], from [[Sabana Grande]], had received his pilot training in private pilot schools in Seattle, Washington and Minneapolis, Minnesota. He then traveled to New York City and joined the Marine Corps. After receiving additional aviation training he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and assigned to the ''First Marine Air Squadron'' which deployed to [[France]] as the newly renamed 1st Marine Aviation Force in July 1918.<ref name=DeChant_p4-5>[[#DeChant|DeChant]] (1947), p.4-5.</ref> There Rigau Carrera and his unit provided bomber and fighter support to the Navy's ''Day Wing, Northern Bombing Group'', thus Rigau Carrera became the first Hispanic [[fighter pilot]] in the Marines.<ref name="EM">"El Mundo"; "Fallece El Aguila - Fue Primer Boricua Manejo Avion en la Isla" (Spanish); by: Malen Rojas Daporte; October 20, 1954; Number 13,448</ref> <ref name="FRC">[http://joseosvaldo.freeyellow.com/Felix.html joseosvaldo@freeyellow.com Felix Rigau Carrera], (Spanish)</ref>  

Lieutenant Frederick L. Riefkohl's brother, [[Rudolph W. Riefkohl|Rudolph William Riefkohl]] also served. He was commissioned a Second Lieutenant and served in France during [[World War l]]. According to the [[United States War Department]], after the war he served as [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] of Coastal Artillery at the [[Letterman Army Medical Center]] in [[Presidio of San Francisco]], in [[California]] (1918).

==Puerto Ricans in non-combat roles==
In 1918, a U.S. Employment Service Bulletin estimated that 75,000 unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico were available for work in the United States. The War Department agreed to transport workers to labor camps in the United States where they would be housed and fed while working on government construction contracts at defense plants and military bases in located mostly in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (state)|Georgia]]. Many of these work camps, however, subjected the new migrants to harsh conditions and even forced labor, which Rafael March<U+00E1>n described in his 1918 deposition to the commissioner of Puerto Rico.<ref>[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5064/  Puerto Rican Laborers during World War I: The Deposition of Rafael March<U+00E1>n]</ref>

By 1918, the Army realized that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. [[Puerto Rican women in the military|Dolores Pi<U+00F1>ero]] from San Juan. She was assigned to the San Juan base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.  Dr. Pi<U+00F1>ero and four male colleagues received orders to open a 400-bed hospital in Ponce, Puerto Rico, to care for the patients who had been infected with the influenza or as it was also known "the Swine Flu". The Swine Flu had swept through Army camps and training posts around the world, infecting one quarter of all soldiers and killing more than 55,000 American troops.<ref>{{cite journal |quotes= |author=Mercedes Graf |year=2002 |month=Summer |title=With high hopes: women contract surgeons in World War I |journal=Minerva: Quarterly Report on Women and the Military |volume= |issue= |pages=7 |id= |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EXI/is_2_20/ai_106472385/pg_7 |accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref>

Puerto Rican migration to the United States increased during and after World War I.

The Porto Rico Regiment returned to Puerto Rico on March 1919 and was renamed the [[The 65th Infantry Regiment|65th Infantry Regiment]] under the Reorganization Act of [[June 4]], [[1920]].<ref>[http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/historic/btlflags/infantry/369thInfReg.htm 369th Regiment US Army color]</ref> The 65th, went on to serve in World War II and the [[Korean War]], where it's members distinguished themselves in combat.  

The need for a Puerto Rican National Guard unit became apparent to  General Luis R. Esteves, who had served as instructor of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry at Camp Las Casas in Puerto Rico. His request was met with the approval of the government and Puerto Rican Legislature. In 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard was organized, Esteves became the first official Commandant of the Puerto Rican National Guard.<ref> Puerto Rico's Fighting 65th U.S. Infantry: From San Juan to Chowon by W.W.
