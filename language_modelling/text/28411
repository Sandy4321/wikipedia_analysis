==Personal life==

Gandhi was born in [[New Delhi]], India, but her parents moved to Canada and she grew up in Toronto.  Her journey as a singer began as a young child singing and dancing around the house. Her father, a musician by hobby and an electronics engineer by profession, recognized her potential and encouraged her to sing. She first performed in 1996 at a gig at her father's show in [[Toronto]] on a Christmas event and the years to follow became prosperous for her. She completed her degrees in health science and business. She also received an internship at CIBC World Markets during her undergrad but the first passion for Gandhi was always singing, so music continued to run in background throughout her education. Gandhi has formal training in Western classical music and during her stay in India has taken up training in Hindustani classical singing.<ref name="tele"/><ref name="ndtv">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/music/jonita-gandhi-lucky-my-first-bollywood-song-for-shah-rukh-khan-starrer-389250|title=Jonita Gandhi: Lucky my first Bollywood song for Shah Rukh Khan-starrer|publisher=NDTV.com|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref> She speaks fluent [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] languages.<ref name="theh">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/a-voice-that-touched-big-bs-heart/article4018718.ece|title=A voice that touched Big B<U+2019>s heart|newspaper=The Hindu.com|date= October 21, 2012|accessdate=July 13, 2014}}</ref>
