{{politics of Slovenia}}
The '''Cabinet of Prime Minister [[Alenka Bratu<U+0161>ek]]''' was announced on 20 March 2013. It was the 11th cabinet of Slovenia. It has been formed after the the [[Slovenian Parliament|parliament]] voted a no confidence vote to [[Cabinet of Cabinet of Janez Jan<U+0161>a II|Jan<U+0161>a's cabinet]] after [[Slovenian People's Party|SLS]], [[Gregor Virant's Civic List|DL]] and [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia|DeSUS]] left his coalition. On 27 February 2013 [[Alenka Bratu<U+0161>ek]] was voted as the next mandatary and so became the first woman to do so in modern Slovenian history.<ref name="Poslanci izglasovali nezaupnico Jan<U+0161>evi vladi, Bratu<U+0161>kova nova mandatarka">{{cite news |url=http://www.primorske.si/Slovenija-in-svet/Poslanci-izglasovali-nezaupnico-Jansevi-vladi-Brat.aspx|title=Poslanci izglasovali nezaupnico Jan<U+0161>evi vladi, Bratu<U+0161>kova nova mandatarka|newspaper=Primorske novice|date=27 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="Prisegla je nova vlada Alenke Bratu<U+0161>ek">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/prisegla-je-nova-vlada-alenke-bratusek/304860|title=Prisegla je nova vlada Alenke Bratu<U+0161>ek|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=20 March 2013}}</ref>

Composition of the new government was quick as it needed to be, as Slovenia was in difficult economic and financial situation that was marked by mass [[2012<U+2013>13 Slovenian protests]]. Bratu<U+0161>ek had most difficulties with finding the new financial minister as nobody was prepared to take responsibility for potential bankruptcy. More than twenty potential candidates have been named until [[Uro<U+0161> <U+010C>ufer]] finally accepted the position of the new minister.<ref name="Lista kandidatov je vlo<U+017E>ena. Finance Uro<U+0161>u <U+010C>uferju.">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/lista-kandidatov-je-vlozena-finance-urosu-cuferju/304431|title=Lista kandidatov je vlo<U+017E>ena. Finance Uro<U+0161>u <U+010C>uferju.|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=14 March 2013}}</ref> He was confirmed as a minister, even though his candidature was believed to be suspicious as he use to be employed in the biggest national bank NLB, which was in big financial debts. The cabinet of Prime minister Bratu<U+0161>ek stabilized the political and economical climate in Slovenia. Her mandate was full of interpelations and increasing number of unemployment and long saga regarding the Ministry of Health and its ministers.<ref name="Tri interpelacije, <U+0161>tiri zamenjave ministrov, ve<U+010D>je <U+0161>tevilo brezposlenih ...">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/mmc-priporoca/tri-interpelacije-stiri-zamenjave-ministrov-vecje-stevilo-brezposlenih/330842|title=Tri interpelacije, <U+0161>tiri zamenjave ministrov, ve<U+010D>je <U+0161>tevilo brezposlenih ...|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=27 February 2014}}</ref>

Cabinet members came from four parties of the new coalition, later joined by the fifth party as [[Alliance of Alenka Bratu<U+0161>ek]] separated from [[Positive Slovenia]]:

*[[Positive Slovenia]] (PS) - 4 Ministers + 1 Minister without portfolio - 1 Minister at the end of the term
*[[Social Democrats (Slovenia)|Social Democrats]] (SD) - 3 Ministers
*[[Gregor Virant's Civic List]] (DL) - 3 Ministers
*[[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]] (DeSUS) - 2 Ministers 
*[[Alliance of Alenka Bratu<U+0161>ek]] (ZaAB) joined after 31 May 2014 - 4 Ministers at the end of the term

==Changes from the preceding cabinet==
The number of ministries rose to 13, up from 12 in the preceding [[Cabinet of Janez Jan<U+0161>a II]]. [[Senko Pli<U+010D>ani<U+010D>]] has returned to Ministry of Justice, where he was a minister in previous government.

*[[Minister of Culture|Ministry of Culture]] was separated from [[Minister of Education|Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sport]] and once again renewed.
*[[Minister of Social Affairs|Ministry of Social Affairs]] was renamed to [[Minister of Social Affairs|Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities]]. 
*Department of [[Minister of Public Administration|Public administration]] was moved from [[Minister of Justice|Ministry of Justice]] to [[Minister of Interior|Ministry of Interior]] to form new joined [[Minister of Interior|Ministry of Interior and Public Administration]]. 
*Many other ministries were renamed.

==List of ministers and portfolios==

===History===
*[[Igor Maher]] was the fastest minister to resign in the history of Slovenian politics, as he stepped down as a minister just after five days. He was involved in a scandal with his real estates, as he was not able to clarify the status of all his propreties. He was replaced by his party colleague [[Samo Omerzel]].<ref name="Omerzel postal novi minister za infrastrukturo">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/omerzel-postal-novi-minister-za-infrastrukturo/305781|title=Omerzel postal novi minister za infrastrukturo|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=2 April 2013}}</ref>
*Minister [[Stanko Stepi<U+0161>nik]] backed down as he was involved in a conflict of interest at one of public tender. He was under suspicion of financing his own company. He was substituted with financial minister Uro<U+0161> <U+010C>ufer, until [[Metod Dragonja]] was named as a new minister.<ref name="Stepi<U+0161>nik gre, Bratu<U+0161>kova <U+017E>e i<U+0161><U+010D>e naslednika">{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/stepisnik-gre-bratuskova-ze-isce-naslednika.html||title=Stepi<U+0161>nik gre, Bratu<U+0161>kova <U+017E>e i<U+0161><U+010D>e naslednika|newspaper=Delo|date=20 November 2013}}</ref>
*[[Minister of Health]] [[Toma<U+017E> Gantar]] surprisingly resigned on 25 November 2013. As he said he resigned, as there is no interest in changing the national health system, which is intertwined with lobbies and corruption. If he was not allowed to reform the system, he was not prepared to take the responsibility for all the patients.<ref name="Koalicija presene<U+010D>ena nad Gantarjevim odstopom">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/koalicija-presenecena-nad-gantarjevim-odstopom/323428||title=Koalicija presene<U+010D>ena nad Gantarjevim odstopom|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=25 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/koalicija-presenecena-nad-gantarjevim-odstopom/323428||title=Koalicija presene<U+010D>ena nad Gantarjevim odstopom|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=25 November 2013}}</ref> Bratu<U+0161>ek started looking for a new candidate and was supposedly in contact with known Slovenian surgeon Danijel Be<U+0161>i<U+010D> Loredan. Later she decided to nominate [[Alenka Trop Skaza]], who was later also confirmed as a new minister.<ref name="Ministrska kandidata uradno: Metod Dragonja in Alenka Trop Skaza">{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/ministrska-kandidata-uradno-metod-dragonja-in-alenka-trop-skaza/329720||title=Ministrska kandidata uradno: Metod Dragonja in Alenka Trop Skaza|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=12 February 2014}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/ministrska-kandidata-uradno-metod-dragonja-in-alenka-trop-skaza/329720||title=Ministrska kandidata uradno: Metod Dragonja in Alenka Trop Skaza|newspaper=MMC RTV Slovenija|date=12 February 2014}}</ref> The saga did not end there, as Trop Skaza resigned just one month later. There were many theories why. One was supposedly her husband, as he was an owner of a company which dealt business with many public institutions. She could have resigned of the same reasons as her predecessor: there was no support for the reforms she announced at her inauguration. Her public statement was that she resigned because of "''framing, lies, unjust criticism, that her and her family have received because of her position as a minister of health.''"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/trop-skaza-ob-odstopu-vedela-sem-da-bo-tezko-a-ne-tako/332933||title=Trop Skaza ob odstopu: "Vedela sem, da bo te<U+017E>ko, a ne tako"|newspaper=Delo|date=25 March 2014}}</ref> Bratu<U+0161>ek had to find a new minister and was again supposedly in contact with Danijel Be<U+0161>i<U+010D> Loredan, but in the end she decided to put the burden on her own shoulders and nominated herself as a minister, which she remained until the end of her mandate.
*[[Tina Komel]] was forced to step down as [[Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia]] lost the Ministry of Health, so [[Karel Erjavec]] demanded a new ministry. [[Minister without portfolio|Ministry without portfolio for Slovenian diaspora]], as one of the least important ministries to Bratu<U+0161>ek, was given to DeSUS. Komel at first did not want to step down, but after a four hour long discussion with the council of Positive Slovenia she finally backed down and prevented a crisis in the coalition.<ref name="Ministrica Tina Komel vendarle odstopila">{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/ministrica-tina-komel-vendarle-odstopila.html||title=Ministrica Tina Komel vendarle odstopila|newspaper=Delo|date=13 February 2014}}</ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.delo.si/novice/politika/ministrica-tina-komel-vendarle-odstopila.html||title=Ministrica Tina Komel vendarle odstopila|newspaper=Delo|date=13 February 2014}}
