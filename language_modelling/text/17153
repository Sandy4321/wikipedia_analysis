'''Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta'''<ref name="stefani"/> (born March 28, 1986),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Concert+Review+Lady+Gaga+Fame+Ball/1439756/story.html|title=Concert Review: Lady Gaga's Fame Ball|last=Saxburg|first=Lynn|date=2009-03-28|publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]''|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> who performs under the [[stage name]] '''Lady Gaga''', is an American singer, songwriter and musician. She began her career as a songwriter for some of pop music's biggest stars, including [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Pussycat Dolls]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[New Kids on the Block]], as well as American singer and producer [[Akon]]. After Akon  recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent, he signed her to a joint deal with his own label, [[Kon Live Distribution]], and then she started to work on her own new material for her debut album. 

Gaga released her debut album ''[[The Fame (album)|The Fame]]'' in 2008, which she explained was "about how anyone can feel famous". To date, the album has spawned the international number one hit singles "[[Just Dance]]" (nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] at the [[51st Grammy Awards]]) and "[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]". Gaga has been influenced by [[glam rock]]ers such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] as well as '[[1980s in music|80s]] [[Pop music|pop]] singers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Morrissey]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. 

==Early life==
Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta in [[Yonkers, New York]], to Joseph Germanotta, an [[internet entrepreneur]] and his wife Cynthia, a telecommunications assistant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/lady_gaga/index.shtml |title=Lady GaGa - Biography | date=2009-04-16 | accesdate=2009-04-16}}</ref> both of whom are [[Italian American]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/thisday/chart-beat-lady-gaga-luis-fonsi-taylor-swift-1003928565.story |title=Chart Beat: Lady GaGa, Luis Fonsi, Taylor Swift, 'Purple Rain' |accessdate=2009-02-19 |author=Bronson, Fred |date=2008-01-08 |work=[[Billboard]] |publisher=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref name="timesonline2">{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5746827.ece| title=Lady Gaga: ready for her close-up | first=Ruby | last=Warrington | work=[[Sunday Times]] | publisher=Times Online | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> As a child, she attended the private [[Catholic school]] [[Convent of the Sacred Heart (New York)|Convent of the Sacred Heart]].<ref name="Times Online.co.uk">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article5325327.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1|title=Lady GaGa: the future of pop?|date=2008-12-14|work=Sunday Times|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2009-02-06}}</ref> 
Having learned piano by ear at the age of four, Gaga went on to write her first piano ballad at 13 and began performing at open mic nights by the age of 14.<ref name="Bio"/> At the age of seventeen she gained early admission to the New York University's [[Tisch School of the Arts]], where she studied music.<ref name="Bio"/> She honed her writing skills by composing essays and analytical papers focusing on topics such as art, religion and socio-political order.<ref name=ARTISTdirect>{{cite web |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4931544,00.html |title= Interview: Lady GaGa |accessdate=2009-02-18 |author=Florino, Rick |date=2009-01-30 |work=[[ARTISTdirect]] |publisher= ARTISTdirect, Inc}}</ref> However, she withdrew from New York University.<ref name = "mtv 55"/>
At age 20, she began working for [[Interscope Records]] as a [[songwriter]], penning songs for pop acts such as the [[Pussycat Dolls]]. 
After she moved out of her parents' house,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riffin.com/iframes/record/artist_spotlights/Lady_Gaga.html|title=Lady Gaga|publisher=Riffin'|accessdate=2009-02-21||author=Webjockey Spiceboyedgar}}</ref> Gaga started performing downtown, in the [[Lower East Side]] club scene with bands Mackin Pulsifer and SGBand. Wanting to differentiate herself from the rock and roll typical of the scene, she chose to focus instead on pop music.<ref name="Contactmusic.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/artist.nsf/artistnames/lady%20gaga |title=Lady GaGa |accessdate=2009-02-20 |work=[[Contactmusic.com]] }}</ref> Speaking to her father's reaction to her drug use and performance in burlesque shows, "He couldn't look at me for a few months...I was in leather thongs, so it was hard for him<U+2014>he just didn't understand."<ref name="Times Online.co.uk"/>

Gaga got her [[stage name]] when the [[music producer]] [[Rob Fusari]] compared her vocal style to that of [[Freddie Mercury]], and took the name ''Gaga'' from the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] song, "[[Radio Ga-Ga]]". It was Fusari who helped her to write some of her early hits, including "Disco Heaven", "Dirty Ice Cream", and "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich".<ref name="Contactmusic.com"/>

==Music career==
===2007: Career beginnings===

Gaga was originally signed to [[Def Jam]] when she was 19 years old; it happened after the [[Record industry|record executive]] [[L. A. Reid]] heard her singing down the hallway from his office.<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/> However Gaga states Reid never met with her.<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/> "I used to wait outside his office for hours, hoping he'd take meetings with me about my songs, but it never happened."<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/> Reid dropped Gaga from the label after three months.<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/>

She was spotted a couple of years later by the music executive Vincent Herbert and signed to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] in January 2008. Impressed by her ear for melody and knack for spotting a great hook, various acts ([[Akon]]'s [[Konvict Muzik|Konvict]] label, as well as [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Pussycat Dolls]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[New Kids on the Block]]) have hired her as a songwriter.<ref name="Times Online.co.uk"/> Gaga also sparked the interest of Interscope's Chairman [[Jimmy Iovine]] in early 2007.<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/> He offered her a label deal via Streamline/Interscope and partnered her with [[singer-songwriter]] Akon.<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard"/> It was Akon, who, upon hearing her sing a reference vocal for one of his tracks, recognized that Gaga also had vocal talent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/Lady-GaGa-Totally-GaGa.4891798.jp |title=Lady GaGa: Totally Ga-Ga|accessdate=February 20, 2009 |author=Cowing, Emma |date=2009-01-20 |work=[[The Scotsman]]}}</ref> Akon ultimately convinced Jimmy Iovine to sign her to a joint deal with his own label, [[Kon Live Distribution]].<ref name="Lady GaGa Billboard">{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003849684|title=Lady Gaga|last=Concepcion|first=Mariel|date=2008-09-12|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref>

Throughout 2007, Lady Gaga collaborated with the similarly named [[Lower East Side]] [[Disc Jokey| Rock DJ]], [[go-go dancing|go-go dancer]] and [[performance art]]ist [[Lady Starlight]], who helped Gaga create her onstage fashions.<ref name="Blast">{{cite web|url=http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/entertainment/2009/01/2009-keep-your-ears-open-to-this-music/2/|title=2009: Keep your ears open to this music|last=Cassis|first=Christine|month=Jan|year=2009|work=[[Blast Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref> The pair began playing gigs at downtown club venues like Mercury Lounge, The Bitter End, and Rockwood Music Hall,<ref name="seattleweekly"/> with their live performance art piece, "Lady Gaga and The Starlight Revue"<ref name="METRO">{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/music/article.html?PROFILE:_Just_who_is_Lady_GaGa?&in_article_id=461127&in_page_id=25|title=Just Who Is Lady GaGa?|last=Lee|first=Ann|month=Jan|year=2009|work=[[Metro.co.uk]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}}</ref>.

Having initially focused on [[avant-garde]], [[electronic (music)|electronic]] [[dance]] music, Gaga found her musical niche when she began to incorporate  [[Pop music|pop]] melodies and the vintage glam-rock of [[David Bowie]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] into the mix.<ref name="Electro Pop Diva">{{ cite web | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1110125/Why-world-going-gaga-electro-pop-diva-Stefani.html | title=Why the world is going gaga for electro-pop diva Stefani | work=[[Daily Mail]] | publisher=Mail Online| author=Adrian Thrills | date=2009-01-09 | accessdate=2009-01-12 }}</ref> "Queen and David Bowie were the key for me...I didn't know what to do until I discovered Bowie and Queen", Gaga says. "When I was playing the New York rock clubs, a lot of [[record label]]s thought I was too theatrical. Then, when I auditioned for stage musicals, the producers said I was too pop."<ref name="Electro Pop Diva"/>

It was through her affiliation with Akon that Gaga started to work on her own new material for her debut album with producer [[RedOne]]. Already having a solid selection of electro-glam, [[David Bowie]]-esque, [[Queen (band)|Queen]] inspired songs, Gaga wanted to mix her retro dance beats with urban melodies, a pop chorus and still retain a rock 'n' roll edge. The first song they produced was a mash-up of [[M<U+00F6>tley Cr<U+00FC>e]]'s hit "[[Girls, Girls, Girls (song)|Girls, Girls, Girls]]" and [[AC/DC]]'s "[[T.N.T.

"Pop culture is art. It doesn<U+2019>t make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it<U+2019>s a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party.
