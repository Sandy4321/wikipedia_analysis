The '''Toyota Corolla''' is a [[compact car]] produced by the [[Japan]]ese [[automaker]] [[Toyota]], which has become very popular throughout the world since the nameplate was first introduced in 1966. In 1997, the Corolla became the bestselling car in the world, with over 30 million sold as of 2007.<ref>[http://www.toyota.com/vehicles/2006/corolla/key_features/history.html History of the Corolla]</ref> Over the past 40 years, one Toyota Corolla car has been sold on average every 40 seconds.<ref>[http://www.worldcarfans.com/5061114.001/first-ever-exported-toyota-corolla-anniversary First Ever Exported Toyota Corolla Anniversary]</ref>

Corollas are currently manufactured in [[Japan]], the [[United States]] ([[Fremont, California]]), the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Derbyshire]]), [[Canada]] ([[Cambridge, Ontario]]), [[Malaysia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] ([[Tianjin]]), [[Taiwan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[South Africa]], [[Brazil]], [[Turkey]], [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Venezuela]], and [[India]].

The Corolla's chassis designation code is "E", as described in Toyota's chassis and engine codes.

==Alternative versions==
===Using the Corolla chassis===
A slightly upmarket version called the '''Toyota Sprinter''' was sold in the Japanese home market. It was replaced in 2001 by the [[Toyota Allex]], which was then replaced by the [[Toyota Blade]] in 2006. 
There have also been several models over the years, including the '''[[Toyota Corolla Ceres|Corolla Ceres]]''' (and similar Sprinter Marino) hardtop, '''[[AE86|Corolla Levin]]''' and [[AE86|Sprinter Trueno]] sports coup<U+00E9>s and hatchbacks, and the Corolla FX hatchback, which became the '''Corolla RunX'''. The RunX was replaced by the [[Toyota Auris|Auris]] in 2006. A mini-[[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPV]] named the '''Corolla Verso''' has also been released in European markets. Its Japanese counterpart is the '''Corolla Spacio''', which has been discontinued as of the 10th generation. The US-market [[Scion xB]] is also sold in Japan as the '''Corolla Rumion'''

Over the years, there have been [[badge engineering|rebadged]] versions of the Corolla, sold by [[General Motors]], including the 1980s' [[Holden Nova]] of [[Australia]], and the Sprinter-based [[Chevrolet Nova]], [[Geo Prizm]] then [[Chevrolet Prizm]] of the United States. The Corolla liftback (TE72) of [[Toyota Australia]] was at one point badged the '''T-18'''. The five-door liftback was sold with the '''Corolla Seca''' name in Australia and the nameplate survived on successive five-door models.
The Daihatsu Charmant was produced with the E30 through E70 series.

The Chevrolet Nova was based on E80 Japanese Sprinter sedan and five-door liftback. The Geo/Chevrolet Prizm was produced with the E90 through E110 series.

===Using the Corolla name===
The [[Toyota Tercel]] was a front wheel drive spin-off of the rear wheel drive Corolla introduced in 1980, called the '''Corolla Tercel''' which later became its own model in 1983.

The Tercel Chassis was used again for the [[Toyota Corolla II|Corolla II]] hatchback.
There will be a redesigned Corolla soon.

===Japan (1966-1970)===
The Corolla was launched in Japan in October 1966. [[Eiji Toyoda]] said it worked hard to create popular demand, and disputes that Toyota rode a wave of private car ownership that was taking off in the mid-1960s.  Its major competitor was the [[Nissan Sunny|Datsun 1000]], released a few months before the Corolla.

The initial car, the KE1x series was small, with a 90&nbsp;in (2286&nbsp;mm) wheelbase.

Transmission was by a 4-speed floor shift [[manual transmission]] or a 2-speed floor or column shift [[automatic transmission]], with [[rear wheel drive]]. At the time, floor shift transmissions were considered only for trucks and 4 speeds implied that the engine didn't have enough torque to drive through only 3 gears (more torque allows each gear to have a wider spread of engine revolutions, thus requiring fewer gears). This was a big risk for Toyota but the effectiveness of the new system gained in popularity.

The suspension in front was [[MacPherson strut]]s supported by a transverse leaf spring beneath the engine cross-member, with [[leaf springs]] connected to a [[solid axle]] in back.

The engine was originally meant to be for the under 1000 cc tax class but was changed late in the design process to be 1077 cc in order to beat the forthcoming Datsun 1000.  This put it into a higher tax class but this gave it some prestige over the Datsun 1000 - helped by its "100 cc advantage" advertising campaign. In August 1969 the engine was upgraded to 1166 cc. Special twin carburetter K-B (1077 cc) and 3K-B (1166 cc) engines were used in the SL grade models for an extra 13 hp.

Japanese engines:
*1K <U+2014> 1.1 L (1077 cc) I4, 8-valve OHV, carb, 60 hp (44 kW)
*1K-B <U+2014> 1.1 L (1077 cc) I4, 8-valve OHV, twin carb, 73 hp (54 kW)

===USA (1968-1970)===
Toyota has been almost steadfast in facelifting each generation after two years, and replacing it with an all-new model every four years. Exports to the United States began in March 1968 at about US$1,700.

American engines:
*1K <U+2014> 1.1 L (1077 cc) I4, 8-valve OHV, carb, 60 hp (44 kW)

The second-generation KE2# / TE2# model, launched 1970, had "coke-bottle" styling. It had a longer 91.9&nbsp;in (2334&nbsp;mm) wheelbase. The front suspension design was improved greatly, using a swaybar, however the rear remained relatively the same. The Corolla became the second-best selling car in the world that year. Grades for sedan were Standard, Deluxe, and Hi-Deluxe. The coup<U+00E9> was offered in Deluxe, SL, SR, and Levin as well as Sprinter variants. The Sprinter Trueno was equivalent to the Corolla Levin.

The TE27 Levin is featured in Auto Modellista, a racing video game by Capcom.

Minor changes were made for the 1973 model year with a new grille, turn signal lights, and tail lights, along with similar treatment to the Sprinter.

===Japan (1970-1978)===
Most models stopped production in July 1974 but the KE26 wagon and van were still marketed in Japan after the 30-series was introduced.

Japanese engines:
*T <U+2014> 1.4 L (1407 cc) I4, 8-valve OHV, carb, 86 hp (63 kW)

===USA (1971-1974)===
The Japan chassis models were all available in USA. A 1.6 L (1588 cc/96 in<U+00B3>) 102 hp (76 kW) engine came in 1971, quite impressive for the time, and a sporty hardtop coup<U+00E9> called the '''SR5''' (also known as the Levin in Japan) was introduced in 1973.  In 1974, the SR5 was entered by [[Car & Driver]] magazine's team in SCCA competition.

===Japan (1974-1979)===
The third-generation Toyota Corolla, built from 1974 to 1979 (worldwide versions) (KE3x/KE5x), marked Toyota's greatest growth in the United States in the wake of the fuel crisis. In addition to the Sprinter, there was a redesigned-body version built by Toyota affiliate [[Daihatsu]], called the [[Daihatsu Charmant]]. While there were certain fourth-generation models with a longer model life, this generation, when considered as a whole, was the longest-lived one, possibly due to the worldwide recession in the 1970s. A large range of cars were built using this chassis, including Corollas, Sprinters, Daihatsu, and the sporty Levin and Trueno models with the DOHC motor. 

The ''[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K]]'' engine was used in certain markets and later the 4K, while most Japanese and American models had the bigger ''[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T]]'' engine. A "Toyoglide" 2/3-speed [[automatic transmission]] was added as well as a four-speed and five-speed manual transmission, driving to the rear wheels. A three-door "[[liftback]]" (E50) and sports coup<U+00E9> (E51) was added in 1976. The E40 and E60 series were assigned to the Sprinter variants.

Japanese engines:
*[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T-G]] <U+2014> 1.6 L (1588 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 8-valve [[DOHC]], [[carburetor|carb]], 124 hp (93 kW)
*[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T-C]] <U+2014> 1.6 L (1588 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 8-valve [[OHV]], [[carburetor|carb]], 75 hp (56 kW)
*[[Toyota K engine#3K|3K-C]] <U+2014> 1.2 L (1166 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 8-valve [[OHV]], [[carburetor|carb]], 55 hp (41 kW)

===USA (1975-1979)===
<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Old_corolla_logo.JPG|thumb|left|Logo from a 1977 Corolla(USA).]] -->
''[[Road & Track]]'' was critical of the 1975 Corolla, calling it "large and heavy" and "expensive" compared to the [[Honda Civic]] and [[Datsun B210]]. They also criticized the "relatively crude rear suspension", lack of interior space, and poor fuel economy when compared to the [[VW Rabbit]]. The base model cost [[USD|US$]] 2711 in 1975, but only the $2989 "deluxe" model had features comparable to the contemporary pack.

Emissions became a problem further into the 1970s especially with the ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K]]'' engine, which became popular because of its low fuel consumption. In later versions of the K engine with emissions equipment, only 60 hp (45 kW) was produced, despite a greater 1290 cc displacement.

The E30 series 2T-C engines outmatched rival Datsun B210's engine output.

American engines:
*[[Toyota T engine#2T|2T-C]] <U+2014> 1.6 L (1588 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 8-valve [[OHV]], [[carburetor|carb]], 75 hp (56 kW)

* '''E-51''' <U+2014> [[Liftback]], 3-door (Std, SR5)

===Australia (1974-1981)===
The Corolla was manufactured in Australia at AMI-Toyota's Port Melbourne production facility. It was a popular car on the Australian market and most bodystyles available elsewhere were utilized. All variants originally came with Toyota's 1166cc 3K motor, which was replaced later by a 1.3L version.

Due to the expenditure of manufacturing of the car in Australia, the production continued for several years after it was replaced by the next generation model everywhere else. A facelift was given to the range in late 1980, giving the car a new grille and rectangular headlamps, however it could not conceal the car's dated styling. Production continued until September 1981, when the already aged fourth-generation Corolla range replaced it.

Australian-market chassis:
* '''E31''' <U+2014> [[Sedan]], 2-door/4-door
* '''E38''' <U+2014> [[Station wagon|Wagon]], 3-door van or 5-door wagon
* '''E37''' <U+2014> [[Hardtop coup<U+00E9>]]

The fourth-generation model released in 1979 in Japan, was boxy and was the last generation to have the entire lineup in rear-wheel-drive. Although most of the fourth generation was replaced by 1984, the station wagon and van versions were offered into 1987.

This generation (apart from the wagon) got a new rear [[coil spring]] five-link rear end with a [[panhard rod]], and the wheelbase was longer at 94.5 in (2400 mm). A new underwhelming 1.8 L (1770 cc/108 in<U+00B3>) ''[[Toyota T engine#3T|3T]]'' engine was optional to some markets, whilst parts of the world retained the old ''[[Toyota K engine#4K|4K]]''. The most notable engine advancement came in 1983, however, as Toyota began offering the 1.6 L (1587 cc/96 in<U+00B3>) [[Toyota A engine#4A|4A-C]].  The aluminum head, [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, although bulkier in size and weight than the [[Toyota K engine|K]] and [[Toyota T engine|T]] engines it was offered alongside, was a grand step up in performance.  This would be the last generation of Corollas to use any [[Pushrod engine|pushrod]] or iron [[cylinder head]] engines, as [[Toyota]] made the decision to focus exclusively on [[aluminium]] [[Cylinder head|head]], [[Overhead camshaft|OHC]] engine design from this point forward.   This was the first generation to have power steering. In the USDM market, this was introduced in the 1982 model year. The 1980-81 models had 4 lamps in the front in some markets, all 1982-83 models have 2 - a facelift involving wraparound headlights, remodeled taillights and new bumpers were introduced in the year 1982.

In 1980, during this model's life, Corolla daily production reached an all-time high, averaging 2,346 units.

The fifth generation is generally regarded as the most popular Corolla when measured against its contemporaries, and some 3.3 million units were produced. This model, from 1983, moved the Corolla into [[front wheel drive]], except for the [[Toyota Levin AE85|AE85]] and [[Toyota AE86|AE86]] Corolla Levin / Sprinter Trueno models (SR-5 / GT-S in USA) which continued on the older [[rear wheel drive]] platform, along with the three-door "liftback" (E72), three-door van (E70) and five-door wagon (E70) of the previous generation, that were still being produced.

The front-wheel-drive wheelbase was now 95.6 in (2428 mm).

It was the first Corolla to top the [[New Zealand]] top-10 lists, ending Ford's dominance of that market. A "short" hatchback range, called the Corolla FX in Japan and the Corolla Compact in [[Germany]], arrived in 1984, on the front-wheel-drive platform. The three and five-door hatchbacks resembled the Corolla sedan with a truncated rear deck and trunk. Although there was a five-door liftback model of the basic Corolla, the FX-based [[hatchback]] was sold alongside it.  The Corolla FX replaced the [[Toyota Starlet]] in North America.

A [[DOHC]] [[multivalve|16-valve]] engine, designated ''[[Toyota A engine#4A|4A-GE]]'', was added in 1983 on the rear-drive cars. It was a 1.6 L (1587 cc) I4 and produced an impressive 124 hp (92 kW), turning the Levin/Trueno (Japan), Corolla GT coup<U+00E9> (Europe) and Corolla '''GT-S''' into a popular [[sports car]]. This engine was also combined with the front-drive transaxle to power the [[MR layout|mid-engined]] [[Toyota MR-2]].

The Sprinter sports cars, in two-door coup<U+00E9> and three-door liftback forms, were notable for the line's first use of pop-up headlamps, which the equivalent Corolla Levin sports models did not have. 

A new '''Corolla FX''', built at the US [[NUMMI]] plant, appeared in 1987. It was available with either [[SOHC]] or [[DOHC]] engines, the latter marketed as the '''FX-16'''. From 1985 to 1988, NUMMI built a rebadged version of the Corolla, sold by [[Chevrolet]] as the [[Chevrolet Nova]]. Nova's successor, the [[Geo Prizm]] was another rebadged Corolla selling in the United States from 1989 to 2002.

All Corollas were front-drive for 1987, with production beginning in May 1987.  For general export, the trim levels are Base, XL, GL, SE, and SE Limited. The GT-i was sold in limited numbers in certain countries. The [[all wheel drive]] '''Sprinter Carib''' wagon used a solid axle rear suspension with coil springs, while the rest used struts all around. The [[4WD]] wagon was sold from 1988 to 1994 and had different bodywork to other Corollas. It was called the [[All-Trac]] in the US and sold with the Tercel or Corolla name in some countries. in general, all models depart from the previous generation's boxy styling, for a more contemporary look and improved aerodynamics.

The Sprinter five-door liftback was called '''Cielo''' in [[Japan]], and re-badged as the Corolla in Europe, though for a period in Ireland (and possibly elsewhere) it was badged the "Sprinter GLS", unusually in cheap-looking decals instead of the metallic-coated plastic badges found on all other Toyotas of the time.

High performance GT-i models are powered by 4A-GE, and offered as 3-door hatchback, sedan, and 5-door liftback. The North American GT-S coup<U+00E9> shared the same engine.

This was awarded the 1988 [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]].

===South Africa (1996-2006)===
A facelifted version of the sixth-generation five-door hatchback was made in South Africa as an entry-level model called the '''[[Toyota Tazz]]''' from 1996 until [[July 5]], [[2006]]. The Tazz was offered as 130, and 160i. Whilst the three-door was sold as a panel van model there, called the [[Toyota Carri]].

===Japan (1987<U+2014>1991)===


The 1.3 liter sedan has 4 speed manual transmission or 3 speed automatic transmission. The only model with 1.5 liter 5A-FHE was SE-Limited G. The 4WD sedan is powered by 1.6 liter 4A-FE.
The Sprinter sedan has opera window on the [[Pillar (car)|C-Pillar]].

The AE92 Levin and Trueno were also fitted with a supercharged engine. It used an SC12 roots type supercharger and a top mounted intercooler that was fed cool air via a scoop on the bonnet. They generated 206 Nm (152 ft<U+00B7>lbf) at 4,400 rpm as opposed to the N/a 4A-GE's 136 Nm (100 ft<U+00B7>lbf) at 4,800 rpm.

===USA (1988-1992)===
North American production of the sedan took place at NUMMI and [[Cambridge, Ontario]], Canada. These two plants made 279,000 units, making a total of 4.5 million of this generation (AE92) made.
The North American models depart from the previous generation's boxy styling, for a more contemporary look and improved aerodynamics.  They feature longer bumpers and small red indicator lights on the quarter panels.

Minor changes for 1991 model years were Toyota (T) ellipse emblem on the grille, all-red tail lights, door-mounted and manual lap front seat belts, and new wheelcovers for DX. Rear garnish was deleted for the Base model. The LE was only available with automatic transmission.

The North American Corolla coup<U+00E9> with retractable headlights was basically a Sprinter Trueno with different front corner lights and longer bumpers. Trim levels are SR5 and GT-S. The GT-S is powered by 4A-GE engine, and comes with full body kits.

The [[four-wheel drive]] [[All-trac]] wagon in Base and SR5 trim levels were sold from 1988 to 1992 and had different bodywork to other Corollas. The Corolla All-trac sedan was sold in very small numbers.

The [[Geo Prizm]] shared a slightly different body with the Japan-market Sprinter, and built as sedan and liftback. These models were slightly more basic than their Europe/Japan versions.

American engines:
*[[Toyota A engine#4A|4A-F]] <U+2014> 1.6 L (1587 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 16-valve [[DOHC]], [[Carburetor|carb]], 95 hp (71 kW)

The next Corolla (AE10x/EE10x) was larger, heavier, and visually more aerodynamic than the model it replaced, with development chief Dr. Akihiko Saito wanting to develop a 'mini-[[Lexus]]', after success with that range's flagship. With its 2465 mm (97 in) wheelbase, the Corolla had moved into the [[compact car|compact]] size class once occupied by the [[Toyota Corona]] and [[Toyota Camry]]. The coup<U+00E9> was dropped for North America, replaced by the [[Toyota Paseo|Paseo]].

The Corolla sedan is nicknamed "Great Corolla" in [[Indonesia]]. Initially the trim levels were 1.3 SE and 1.6 SE-G. The smaller engine model was replaced by 1.6 SE in 1994.

The 1.3 XLi, 1.5 GLi [[sedan]], [[station wagon|wagon]], and Levin 1.5 SJ [[coup<U+00E9>]] were sold in [[Hong Kong]].

In the [[Philippines]], three variants were sold, XL and XE with 1.3-liter carbureted (2E) engines, and the GLi, with a 1.6-liter fuel-injected motor (4A-FE). The top model was offered in both manual and automatic transmissions. The Corolla was also the first 1.6-liter car to introduce 14-inch alloy wheels to the country in 1992. Other pioneer features that followed were rear seatbelts (late 1994) and a driver's airbag (late 1995).

===Japan (1991-1996)===
This model was not as successful compared to previous series due to a rising yen and home-market recession, blunting demand.
The standard Corolla model range included the 5 door hatch back and lift back models, 2 door hatch back and the 4 door sedan and station wagon models.  Also returning in this model line were the two-door coup<U+00E9>s, the Trueno and the Levin. A 4WD variant of the sedan and station wagon were also available with a 1.6 liter gasoline or 2.0 liter diesel engine.
Minor face lift changes were introduced in May of 1993 these included a new grille, a reconfiguration of the rear lamps and various bits of trim and garnish. Various submodels including the 4-door '''hardtop''' Corolla '''Ceres''' and Sprinter '''Marino''' were also available. They bore no real exterior resemblance but feature the chassis and most of the engine range of the standard Corollas.

===USA and Canada (1993-1997)===
In North America, the Corolla was new for the 1993 model year. It had a different grille and longer bumpers than models for other regions. The base model came with the 1.6 liter 4A-FE engine. The DX, LE and wagon came with the 1.8 liter 7A-FE. The 1993 and 1994 versions of the 7A-FE engine were rated at 86 kW (115 hp), later versions rated at 78 kW (105 hp). The LE has sporty front seats and was available in the US with A/T only or available in Canada with either A/T or M/T. Minor changes occurred for the 1996 model year. Among these changes, the DX received bright red/clear tail lights and rear garnish, and new wheel covers. The LE was discontinued for 1996, and the Base model was also offered with CE Package. Sporty Corollas and 4WD Corollas were no longer imported during this generation.  Some 1993 Corollas sold in Canada were produced in Japan.

===Europe (1992-1997)===
The five-door Sprinter was sold as the '''Corolla Sprinter''' in some markets in Europe. The three and five-door Corolla FX was also sold in Europe simply as the Corolla, and was available mostly in normal (non-sports) specs unlike the FX range available in Japan. 
In Europe, the hatchback sold better than sedan and wagon. Although basically the trim levels are Base, XLi and GLi, also there was the GS. The GS featured a fully colour coded exterior and with full electrics and a tilt/slide steel sunroof. It also had an upgraded interior with white dials and a rev counter. In UK the Corolla was marketed as S, CD, and CDX.
The sedan has rear license plate mounted on the trunk as opposed to other region models on the bumper.

The eighth generation, which shared its platform (and doors, on some models) with its predecessor, was introduced in May 1995. Due to a recession, Toyota ordered that Corolla development chief Takayasu Honda cut costs, hence the carryover engineering.

For the general market, the Corolla was offered in Base, XLi, GLi, and SE-G trim levels.

===Japan (1995-2000)===

This marked the beginning of the end of the Sprinter. The Sprinter Trueno coup<U+00E9> range was carried over with a facelift, while the wagon was identical to the Corolla.

Japanese models received minor changes in April 1997 with new nose, tail, and interior. The rear panel is totally different, therefore the trunk and tail lights are not interchangeable between the old and facelift models.
The new Japanese rear panel is the same as the European model.

===USA and Canada (1998-2002)===
All North American Corollas were now built in [[California]] (by [[NUMMI]]) or Canada (by [[TMMC]]). A new all-aluminum engine powered all Corollas, making this generation lighter than its predecessor. This new engine uses a timing chain instead of a timing belt.  In the US market only sedans were offered and all came with daylight driving lights. Grades are VE, CE, and LE. The Touring Package with side skirts, a whiteface instrument cluster, and aluminum wheels are reserved for CE and LE. Side airbags were optional, but very few of them actually had them.  The 1999 model also got a slight refresh with the front headlights and taillights.  In addition to the VE, CE, and LE, a new S model was also introduced.  [[VVT-i]] [[variable valve timing]] was added to the engine for 2000 with a small increase in power from 120hp to 125hp. For 2001 model year, the VE was deleted, the CE became the base model and the sporty S was added as the replacement of the Touring Package. 

The [[Chevrolet Prizm]] (replacing the Geo Prizm) had two main differences from the Toyota Corolla, though they were made in the same plant: it used the Japanese intake manifold and tuning, and put in a Delco stereo, which provided better sound quality but required a replumbing of the center stack as the Delco unit is taller than the Denso.  The 1999 Prizm has a Delco HVAC system which is different from the Corolla.  

The US-market 2001 Toyota Corolla has a maximum legal carrying capacity of 390 kg (850 lb).

===Europe and Oceania (1996-2001)===
This range had different front and rear ends to the Japanese models, though the sides and interior remained mostly the same. It can be distinguished by the round headlights and mesh grille. As a result, a sporting model with a six-speed gearbox was offered. The European three door hatchback is the base for the Corolla World Rally Car (WRC). In Australia the Corolla liftback is called Seca. Grades for sedan and Seca are Ascent, Conquest, and Ultima. The Seca Sportivo with turbocharged 7A-FE engine was added in 2001. In 1997, the [[Toyota Corolla Spacio|Corolla Spacio]], with its body panels stamped at long-time Toyota supplier Kanto Autoworks, was introduced as a [[two-box]] [[minivan]] version and sold as the [[Toyota Corolla Verso]], which was technically similar to the [[Toyota Avensis]] in Europe and the [[Toyota Spacio]] in New Zealand.

This generation received a facelift in 1999, featuring a different nose (the previous round headlights proved unpopular, so it was replaced with twin smaller headlights under a single cover on either side ), and the new [[Toyota ZZ engine|ZZ series]] engines with [[VVT-i]] replacing the old [[Toyota A engine|A series]] engines.

The ninth-generation Corolla (NZE120/ZZE120) appeared in August 2000 with edgier styling and a longer 2600 mm (102.4 in) wheelbase. It is built on a shortened [[Toyota Vista]] platform<U+2014>the Vista being a mid-sized, rather than compact car. 

The Corolla has also spawned another multi-purpose vehicle, the [[Toyota Matrix|Matrix]], sold in Canada and the United States, and forms the basis of the [[Pontiac Vibe]]. The Vibe, in turn, was sold with a different [[grille]] in Japan and is called the [[Toyota Voltz]].

===Japan (2000-2006)===
Like the Vista, the Corolla's width is limited to 1700 mm (67 in), to avoid being in a higher tax bracket in Japan.

The station wagon model is called the '''Toyota Corolla Fielder''' in Japan, and the five-door the '''Toyota Corolla Runx''' launching in 2001. The ''Allex'' was also launched to replace the Sprinter.

The [[Toyota Corolla Spacio]] (Verso in Europe) moved on to the new platform, with later models adding a third row of [[fold-down seating]] in the back.

===Europe (2002-2007)===
Most European models are wider than the Japanese counterparts. 

European engines:

===Southeast Asia (2002-present)===

A luxury version of the Corolla model, called the '''Corolla Altis''' is also sold there. It debuted in late 2001 as model year 2002. The Southeast Asian variant of the ninth-generation Corolla is bigger and more luxurious compared to the Japanese Corolla. The Corolla Altis features unique interior and exterior panels that separates it from the basic Corolla.  The Corolla Altis is targeted at consumers who prefer more comfort than the current Corolla but do not wish to buy the more luxurious Camry. The Corolla Altis is manufactured in [[Thailand]]. Two versions of engine are available, the 87 kW (116 bhp) [[Toyota ZZ engine#3ZZ-FE|1.6 3ZZ-FE engine]] and the 100 kW (134 bhp) [[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ-FE|1.8 1ZZ-FE engine]], both featuring [[VVTi]]. The Altis range of the Corolla is sold in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Vietnam]], [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Taiwan]], [[India]] and [[Thailand]]. In 2004, the Corolla Altis received its first facelift. Changes include a new grille design, LED tail lights, different alloy wheels and minor interior updates (auto climate control became a standard feature in lower end variants). Two years later, to keep up with much newer competitors, the Corolla Altis received its second facelift. Exterior changes include another redesigned grille, redesigned chrome rear license plate ornament, a new third LED brake light, and a new steering wheel audio switch. A new aerokit and new wing mirrors with signal indicators (similar to the 2007 Camry) is available as an optional package in Malaysia. In Singapore, Toyota's exclusive authorised dealer Borneo Motors originally sold the Japanese version Corolla, but later replaced it with the Corolla Altis. The low end variant of the Corolla Altis is also branded as the '''Toyota Limo''', featuring lower spec and intended for taxi business in Thailand. It is not to be confused with the low end taxi version of the [[Toyota Vios]] which is also called '''Toyota Limo''' in Indonesia. In terms of product lifespan and number of units sold, The Corolla Altis easily outlived its Corolla predecessors, making it the most popular Corolla variant/generation in Southeast Asia.

ASEAN engines: 
*1NZ-FE VVT-i (Variable Valve Timing-intelligent), 4-Cylinder in-Line, DOHC, 16 Valve, Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) with 3 way catalytic converter, Maximum Output: 145HP / 6,000rpm and  Maximum Torque: 188Nm / 4,200rpm, Rack and Pinion with power assist.

===USA and Canada (2003-2008)===
The North American model is longer and is based from the '''Corolla Altis''' distributed in Southeast Asia. It came to the [[United States]] in Spring 2002 as model year 2003. Trim levels are CE, S, and LE. 2008 is the last model year for the ninth generation Corolla. 

The [[torsion bar]] suspension and [[drum brake]]s in the rear are anachronisms, however. The sporty '''XRS''' model, introduced for 2005 & 2006 only, features the high-revving 127 kW (170 hp) 172 Nm (127 ft<U+00B7>lbf) [[Toyota ZZ engine#2ZZ|2ZZ-GE]] engine and 6-speed manual from the [[Toyota Celica]] GT-S and [[Lotus Elise]].

American engines: (ZZE-122)
*2002-present <U+2014> [[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ|1ZZ-FE]] <U+2014> 1.8 L (1794 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 16-valve [[DOHC]], [[fuel injection|FI]], [[VVT-i]], 130 hp (97 kW) <U+2014> ''CE, LE, S'' (TRD 1.8L Supercharger is available for this engine)
*2005 <U+2014> [[Toyota ZZ engine#2ZZ|2ZZ-GE]] <U+2014> 1.8 L (1796 cc) [[Straight-4|I4]], 16-valve [[DOHC]], [[fuel injection|FI]], [[VVTL-i]], 170 hp (127 kW) <U+2014> ''XRS''

Safety information: ABS is an option and may be difficult to find.  Side impact airbags (seat mounted in 2003, with curtain airbags available in 2005) are an option, and may be difficult to find. The ninth generation Corolla was rated Good in the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) frontal offset crash test.

Audio electronics information: Stereo radios may be AM/FM single disc player, or AM/FM six CD disc in-dash player.  Typically the six disc radio comes with six speakers as opposed to the four speakers.  The two additional speakers are on the door inside by the mirrors.  The factory installed radio in the Corolla typically does NOT have an XM or Sirius satellite radio button or connection.  Toyota had no plans to offer an [[XM]] or [[Sirius]] adapter kit for factory Corolla radios as of January 2007.  However, there are aftermarket SAT button emulators that may work. Factory radios are reportedly manufactured by [[Panasonic]] ([[Matsushita]] A51813 and A51814 on radio face) and Eclipse ([[Fujitsu Ten]]) or [[JBL]](A51815 on the radio face) depending on procurement of parts by the factory.  No [[iPod]] adapter kits are available for Corolla from Toyota for the factory radios. Some upgrades for equipment may be in the works, however this is backstage to new model development.

====20th Anniversary Edition (2008)====

To commemorate 20 years of building Toyota Corolla in Canada, Toyota Canada offered 20th Anniversary Edition Corolla CE for the 2008 model year, which includes air conditioning, power door locks with keyless entry, cruise control, power windows with driver's side auto down, special edition badging, aluminium alloy wheels, power moon roof on top of Corolla CE. 

[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/July2007/09/c4576.html The 2008 Toyota Corolla includes special 20th Anniversary Edition for Canada]</ref>

===Rest of the world=== 

In [[Brazil]], the Corolla sedan and the Corolla Fielder are built locally. It is available with the 1.6 [[Toyota ZZ engine#3ZZ-FE|3ZZ-FE engine]] (sedan only) and the [[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ-FE|1ZZ-FE]]. The sedan is externally identical to the US model, but the Fielder has a different styling from the Japanese version. Starting from the 2008 model (released May 2007), the 1.8L engine has [[flexible fuel]] technology. Unlike most other flexible fuel vehicles in Brazilian market, the Corolla Flex has the same power ratings either with [[ethanol]] or [[gasoline]].

The Corolla sedan, wagon and 5-door hatchback (Seca) sold in Australia are sourced from Japan, while a few years ago, some hatchbacks were sourced from [[South Africa]]. Trim levels are Ascent, Ascent Sport, Conquest, and Ultima (Auto sedan only). The sporty '''Levin''' (hatchback and wagon) and high performance '''Sportivo''' was available in hatchback only and was built in South Africa. The Sportivo is powered by [[Toyota ZZ engine#2ZZ-GE|2ZZ-GE engine]] and a six-speed manual gearbox (also used in the Celica) , while the other models have [[Toyota ZZ engine#1ZZ-FE|1ZZ-FE]]. The Sportivo was discontinued in Australia from 2006 due to the prohibitive costs involved in modifying the engine to comply with Euro IV emissions. All the other models all had their engine power and torque reduced to 93 kW and 161 N<U+2022>m from 100 kW and 171 N<U+2022>m respectively from October 2005 production to comply with Euro IV. From May 2006 production, the Ascent and Ascent Sport models were upgraded with standard front power windows and passenger airbag, while the Conquest models had ABS brakes as standard fitment. The equipment upgrades only apply to the sedan and hatch models as the Corolla wagon ceased production in August 2006. 

In China, when Toyota introduced its locally-made Corolla, it is named as '''Toyota Huaguan''', ''Huaguan'' being the translation of the word ''corolla''.

===Japan===
The tenth generation Corolla was released in Japan on [[October 10]], [[2006]]. The sedan is now known as the Corolla '''Axio'''.<ref>[http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/news/06/1010.html 10th Generation Corolla released]</ref> The Axio name was created from the Greek word "axia", meaning "things with value". The station wagon retains the '''Corolla Fielder''' name.  To save neck-twisting, the Corolla gets Toyota's latest intelligent parking-assist system. The option costs [[Japanese yen|<U+00A5>]]105,000, or $879 at current exchange rates. A backup camera monitor is standard. The RunX was replaced by the [[Toyota Auris]] and the Spacio was discontinued.

====Equipment====
A rearview monitor displays an image of the area to the rear of the vehicle while backing up to reduce the burden on the driver when parking (standard on all Corolla Axio models). 

The optional advanced Intelligent Parking Assist system supports steering operations when parallel parking and backing into a parking space.  Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and based on the results estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target parking position. 
The Corolla Axio features a new Pre-crash Safety System that uses millimeter-wave radar.  When the millimeter-wave radar detects a high risk of collision, the Pre-crash Seatbelts provide better initial restraint capabilities for passengers while the Pre-Crash Brake Assist system decelerates the vehicle to reduce the collision speed and contribute to less collision-caused damage. 
The new Radar Cruise Control system detects and monitors the preceding vehicle and the lane, maintaining a fixed distance according to the preceding vehicle's speed within a preset range of speed. 

===North America===
The North American Corolla was unveiled on [[October 31]], [[2007]] at the [[SEMA]] show. It will be available in dealerships in February 2008 as a 2009 model.  A total of 5 trim grades (Standard, LE, XLE, S, and XRS) will be offered. The first 4 trim grades will come with Toyota's 1.8-liter [[Toyota ZR engine|2ZR-FE]] four-cylinder engine good for 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque, mated to either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission. The XRS grade is equipped with the 2.4-liter [[Toyota AZ engine|2AZ-FE]] engine, good for 158 hp and 162 lb-ft of torque, with a choice of five-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmissions. Corollas with the 1.8-liter engine have an EPA fuel economy rating of 27 mpg city/35 mpg highway. The 2.4-liter is rated at 22 mpg/30 mpg with the automatic and 22 mpg/29 mpg with the manual.

===Australia===
The new Corolla was introduced to the Australian market on [[May 18]]th, [[2007]]. It is available in both sedan and hatchback models, with more safety features and higher levels of luxury. The new 1.8-litre [[Toyota ZR engine|2ZR-FE]] Dual [[VVT-i]] - with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kw power output. This figure decreased when the old model<U+2019>s 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine dropped to 93kW of power and 161Nm of torque (from 171Nm) in late 2005 to meet the 2006 Euro IV emissions requirements. A new 6-speed manual is the standard gearbox, but, disappointingly, the automatic is still a 4-speed despite speculation of a 5-speed like the new [[Honda Civic]], a robotized 5-speed optional in the European Auris, or a [[Continuously variable transmission|CVT]] available in the Japanese model. The new Corolla is available in 4 trim levels for the hatch (Ascent, Conquest, Levin SX and Levin ZR) and 3 for the sedan (Ascent, Conquest and Ultima - auto only), with the Corolla wagon discontinued in Australia. The Levin ZR and Ultima grade features HID [[Headlight#HID technology|xenon headlamps]], rain sensing wipers, smart entry and start system and automatic climate control. Safety equipment levels has also been improved with ABS brakes and dual airbags standard across the range, whilst side, curtain and a driver's knee airbag is optional on Ascent and Levin SX models and standard on Conquest, Levin ZR and Ultima models. Although the new hatch is badged [[Toyota Auris|Auris]] name in most world markets, the Corolla name was retained for the Australian market.

Other than the outdated 4-speed auto, another downside to this car is the performance. Tested at 9.7 seconds to 100 km/h for the manual model, it's 0.7 second slower than its predecessor. This is likely on account of its weight, a hefty 1300 kg, which is curiously more than the Civic unlike before wherein it was usually lighter. However, a 5-star crash-test rating (when fitted with side, curtain and driver's knee airbag) has been attained, a remarkable feat for its class.

===New Zealand===
Like Australia, all models are marketed under the Corolla nameplate. The range is similar to the Australian range with the same engines and drivetrain, however, models are designated as the base GX and higher spec GLX. What distinguishes the [[New Zealand]] range from the rest of the world is the addition of the Corolla Fielder wagon which is only seen in the Japan market. With station wagons so popular in New Zealand, demand of the previous model was enough to justify it. New Zealand is the only export market for the wagon. It is marketed as the Corolla GX Wagon with the 1NZ-FE engine. While the hatch and sedan feature the 1.8-litre [[Toyota ZR engine|2ZR-FE]] Dual [[VVT-i]], the wagon features the JDM 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder, 16-valve, DOHC VVT-i engine. It is specified lower than the GX model hatch and sedan due to the wagon being aimed at the price-conscious fleet market and is priced accordingly.

===Europe and China===
The global debut of the third variant of the new Corolla was staged at the Beijing Auto Show. This variant, which uses a wider and longer version of the Axio's platform, has styling similar to that of the Camry's while keeping the Axio's interior. The European and Chinese market are receiving this variant, which is likely to also be sold in Asian and Taiwan markets as the new Altis. The Chinese market Corolla's name was also changed to match the English name in pronunciation. 

In Ireland, the Corolla was launched in December 2006 but was not available until January 2007. That made it one of the first countries in the world to receive this model.  Only the saloon version was at first made available with a I.4 litre engine in Terra, Strata and Luna trim levels (the estate version of the new Corolla was not available in Ireland at the time of writing).  

Such saloon versions are more popular than the recently launched Auris.  Many commentators have likened the styling of the new Corolla to a similarly styled Camry launched in 1996.

However, [[United Kingdom|British]] buyers are currently only offered the Auris, and there are no known plans for the current Corolla to be sold in Britain.

===Hong Kong SAR===

In Hong Kong, only 1.5L engine models are currently available. The reason of adopting a 1.5L engine, instead of higher capacity engines, is probably due to lower vehicle license levy.

===South Africa===

The Toyota Corolla was first introduced to South Africa in 1975, but only in 1984 did they start being assembled and manufactured locally. The all-new tenth generation Corolla was launched in South Africa in September 2007. Unlike in some countries, Corolla mainly refers to the sedan and not the hatchback, which in South Africa is known as the [[Toyota Auris]]. Toyota's manufacturing plant is located in Durban provides Corolla, Hi-Lux and Fortuner model exports to Europe.

The Corolla car's build is lower and wider than its predecessor. It looks highly polished; clean and sleek, giving it a refined classy feel. The exterior's level of refinement is further reflected in the car's spacious, luxurious interior. 

The all-new Corolla has been awarded a EURO NCAP 5-star rating (applies to all models in the range with knee airbags). [http://www.toyota.co.za Toyota South Africa] achieved a new all-time sales record for the South African motor industry in October 2007 with the Corolla (including Auris) leading the vehicle sales chart.

The car is available in the following models:
2.0 Diesel (Exclusive, Advanced)
1.8 Petrol Exclusive, Exclusive Auto, Advanced)
1.6 Petrol (Advanced, Advanced M-MT, Professional) and
1.4 Petrol (Advanced, Professional)

==Safety==
In Australia, Toyota Corolla models built between 1982-2004 were assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006:<ref>[http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/ucsr Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 for Toyota Corolla in Australia]</ref>
*(1982-1984) <U+2014> significantly worse than average level of occupant protection
*(1986-1988) <U+2014> worse than average
*(1989-1993) <U+2014> worse than average
*(1994-1997) <U+2014> average
*(1998-2001) <U+2014> significantly better than average
*(2002-2004) <U+2014> average

In North America, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] rates the 1998-2002 models as Acceptable in their 40-mph Frontal Offset crash test.  Initial 2003 models had an overall Good rating, but received a Marginal on left foot injury protection.  A rebuild beginning December 2002, which continues through to the 2007 model, gives the Corolla a Good rating in all aspects of the test.  Corolla models from model year 2005 to present with optional side curtain air bags received an Acceptable rating in the Side Impact crash test, largely due to a Marginal rating in Structure/Safety Cage design.  Otherwise, injury protection ratings for Driver and Rear Passenger were all good except for Driver pelvis/leg injury protection, which was Acceptable.
