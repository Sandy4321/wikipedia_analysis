'''Richmond Park''' in south-west London was created by Charles I in the 17th century<ref name= Pastscape>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=397979|title=Richmond Park: National Monuments Record, Pastscape|publisher= [[English Heritage]]|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> as a [[Medieval deer park|deer park]]. The largest of London's Royal Parks, it is of national and international importance for wildlife conservation. The park is a [[national nature reserves in England|national nature reserve]], a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and a [[Special Area of Conservation]] and is included, at Grade I, on [[English Heritage]]'s [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England]]. Its landscapes have inspired many famous artists and it has been a location for several films and TV series.

Richmond Park includes many buildings of architectural or historic interest. The Grade I-listed [[White Lodge]] was formerly a royal residence and is now home to the [[Royal Ballet School]]. The park's boundary walls and ten other buildings are listed at Grade II, including [[Pembroke Lodge]], the home of 19th-century British Prime Minister Lord [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]] and his grandson, the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].

Historically the preserve of the monarch, the park is now open for all to use and includes a golf course and other facilities for sport and recreation. It played an important role in both World Wars and in the 1948 and 2012 Olympics.

The park was designated as an SAC in April 2005 on account of its having "a large number of ancient trees with decaying timber.

==Governance==
The [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]] manages Richmond Park and the other [[Royal Parks of London]] under powers set out in the [[Crown Lands Act 1851]], which transferred management of the parks from the monarch to the government.  Day-to-day management of the Royal Parks has been delegated to [[The Royal Parks]], an executive agency of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS). The Royal Parks' Board sets the strategic direction for the agency. Appointments to the Board are made by the [[Mayor of London]].<ref name="Royal Parks Board">{{cite web | url=http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=252 | title=Royal Parks Board | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref>

==Access==
Richmond Park is enclosed by a high wall with several gates. The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only, or allow bicycle, pedestrian and other vehicle access. The gates for motor vehicle access are open only during daylight hours, and the speed limit is 20&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]]. Apart from taxis, no commercial vehicles are allowed unless they are being used to transact business with residents of the park.<ref name="opsi.gov.uk">[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19971639.htm The Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997]</ref>

The Beverley Brook Walk runs through the park between Roehampton Gate and Robin Hood Gate. The [[Capital Ring]] walking route passes through the park from Robin Hood Gate to Petersham Gate. The Thames Cycle Route runs across the park from Ham Gate to Roehampton Gate. [[London Cycle Network]] route no. 3 goes through the park.<ref name="Management Plan 16-29"/>

The park has designated [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]]s and [[cycle path]]s.  These are shown on maps<ref name="Map"/> and noticeboards displayed near the main entrances, along with other regulations that govern use of the park. The bridleways are special in that they are for horses (and their riders) only and not open to other users like normal bridleways. Cycling is allowed only on main roads and on the Tamsin Trail (the shared-use pedestrian cycle path that runs close to the park's perimeter).<ref name="Cycling">{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/visitor-information/park-regulations-and-policies/cycling-in-the-royal-parks | title=Cycling in the Royal Parks | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Park Regulations and Policies | accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref>

As the park is a national nature reserve and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, all dog owners are required to keep their dogs under control while in the park. This includes not allowing their dog to disturb other park users or disrupt wildlife. In 2009, after some incidents leading to the death of wildfowl, the park's dogs on leads policy was extended. Park users are said to believe that the deer are feeling increasingly threatened by the growing number of dogs using the park<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/pets/9321953/Watch-out-Fenton-Richmond-Park-deers-take-on-dogs.html|title=Watch out Fenton!

==Law enforcement==
A [[robbery|mugging]] at gunpoint in 1854 reputedly led to the establishment of a park police force.<ref>Baxter Brown, p. 115</ref> Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate [[Royal Parks Constabulary]] but that has now been subsumed into the [[Royal Parks Operational Command Unit]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/policing-in-the-royal-parks |title=Policing in the Royal Parks|publisher= [[The Royal Parks]]|accessdate= 6 February 2015}}</ref> The [[mounted police]] have been replaced by a patrol team in a [[four-wheel drive]] vehicle.

==History==

In 1625 [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] brought his court to [[Richmond Palace]] to escape an outbreak of plague in London<ref name="Landscape History">{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/about-richmond-park/landscape-history | title=Richmond Park: Landscape History | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref> and turned the area on the hill above Richmond into a park for the hunting of red and fallow deer.<ref name="Landscape History"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frp.org.uk/richmond-park|title= About Richmond Park|publisher= [[The Friends of Richmond Park]]|accessdate= 5 June 2012}}</ref> It was originally referred to as the king's "New Park"<ref name= Eyre>{{cite book | title=ref MPE 1/426 | publisher=[[The National Archives (UK)]]}}</ref> to distinguish it from the existing park in Richmond, which is now known as [[Old Deer Park]]. In 1637 he appointed [[Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland]] as keeper of the new park, for life, with a fee of 12 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|(old) pence]] a day, pasture for four horses, and the use of the brushwood.<ref name="Calendar 1644">{{cite book | url=http://archive.org/stream/cu31924091770309#page/n289/mode/2up|title=Calendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I, 1644, preserved in Her Majesty's Public Record Office | publisher=[[HMSO]] | author=William Douglas Hamilton (editor) | year=1888 | location=London | page=234}}</ref> Charles's decision, also in 1637, to enclose the land<ref>An [[Ordnance Survey]] map, published in 1949 and now held at [[The National Archives (UK)]], ref ZOS 5/5, [http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/s/res?_q=ZOS+5%2F5&x=26&y=25] shows contemporary features in Richmond Park alongside the place names and field boundaries that existed prior to the 1637 Enclosure Act.</ref> was not popular with the local residents, but he did allow pedestrians the right of way.<ref name="Malden">{{cite web | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43018#n95 | title=A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3 | publisher=British History Online | work=[[Victoria County History]] | year=1911 | accessdate=3 December 2012 | author=H E Malden | pages=533<U+2013>546}}</ref> To this day the walls remain, although they have been partially rebuilt and reinforced.

Following [[Charles I of England#Execution|Charles I's execution]], custodianship of the park passed to the [[Corporation of the City of London]]. It was returned to the restored monarch, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], on his return to London in 1660.<ref>McDowall, p. 51</ref>

In 1736 the Queen's Ride was cut through existing woodland to create a grand avenue through the park.<ref name="FRP Guide97">{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Michael Davison  |publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=97|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}</ref>

===Public access===
In 1751, [[Princess Amelia of Great Britain|Princess Amelia]] became ranger of Richmond Park after the death of [[Robert Walpole]]. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter.<ref>{{cite book|title= Historical Dictionary of the British Monarchy|author= Kenneth J. Panton |publisher= Scarecrow Press, Inc|ISBN= 0-8108-5779-0|year=2011}} p. 45</ref> This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court.<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 38"> Pollard and Crompton, p. 38</ref> The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park.

===Wartime use===
In or around 1870, the [[Inns of Court Regiment#History|Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers]] were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground.<ref name = "Cloake 196"/>

On 7 December 1915 English inventor Harry Grindell Matthews demonstrated, in a secret test on Pen Ponds, how [[selenium]] cells would work in a  remotely controlled prototype weapon for use against German [[Zeppelins]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.harrygrindellmatthews.com/earlywireless.asp | title=Remote Controlled Boat | publisher=Jonathan Foster | work=The Death Ray: The Secrey Life of Harry Grindell Matthews | date=2008 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Foster, Jonathan}}</ref> Reporting on this story several years later, in April 1924, ''[[The Daily Chronicle]]'' reported that the test had been carried out in the presence of [[Lord Balfour]], [[Lord Fisher]] and a staff of experts.

===Petersham Hole===
The [[Petersham Hole]] was a sink hole caused by subsidence of a sewer which forced the total closure of the [[A307 road]] in Petersham in 1979<U+2013>80. The hole and subsequent repair work forced a total road closure of the main arterial route between Richmond and Kingston. To help relieve the pressure on local transport pressure, Richmond Park remained open to vehicular traffic overnight between Richmond, Ham, and Kingston gates. The park road was widened at Ham Cross near Ham Gate to accommodate temporary traffic lights to facilitate the additional traffic flow. This additional and unusual traffic resulted in the deaths of 84 deer in the park whilst the diversion was in operation.<ref name="RTT19800912">{{cite news |work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] |date=12 September 1980}}</ref>

==Gates==
===Six original gates===
[[File:Richmond gates of Richmond Park (March 2010) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Richmond Gate, designed by [[Sir John Soane]]]]
When the park was enclosed in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by [[Sir John Soane]]<ref name="Soane">{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/131-gate-design-credited-to-soane | title=Gate design credited to Soane | publisher=Friends of Richmond Park | work=News | accessdate=12 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="EH Richmond Gate">{{cite web | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1263361 | title=Richmond Gate Lodge, Screen Walls, Gate Piers and Gates | publisher=[[English Heritage]] | work=[[National Heritage List for England]] | date=24 September 2010 | accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> and were widened in 1896.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of [[Coombe, Kingston upon Thames|Coombe]], with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901.<ref name= "McDowall71-78">McDowall, pp. 71<U+2013>78</ref> The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The [[chinoiserie]] lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.<ref name= McDowall71-78/>

Robin Hood Gate takes its name from the nearby Robin Hood Inn (demolished in 2001) and is close to what is called<ref name="Robin Hood Roundabout">{{cite web | url=http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/675837 | title=A3 Robin Hood Roundabout | publisher=Geograph | accessdate=8 October 2012 | author=Nigel Cox}}</ref> the Robin Hood roundabout on the [[A3 road|A3]].

===Other gates===

Chohole Gate served the farm that stood within the park on the site of the present Kings Farm Plantation. It is first mentioned in 1680.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> The gate now provides access to Richmond Park Golf Course. Kingston Gate dates from about 1750. The existing gates date from 1898.<ref name= McDowall71-78/>

In 1736 Bog Gate (also then known as Queen's Gate) was opened as a private entrance by which [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] could enter the park on her journeys between White Lodge and Richmond Lodge, a royal residence in Old Deer Park. Public access, 24 hours a day, was granted in 1894 and the present "cradle" gate installed.<ref name="McDowall 70">McDowall, p. 70</ref> The gate connects the park with [[East Sheen Common]].

Petersham Gate served the Russell School, replacing the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further up the hill was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896.<ref name= McDowall71-78/> Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, is probably a nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public.<ref name="McDowall 70"/> Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate<ref name= McDowall71-78/> was constructed during World War I for access to the newly built South Africa Military Hospital.<ref name="Hearsum WWI">{{cite web | url=http://hearsumcollection.org.uk/the-collection-and-the-friends-of-richmond-park/item/the-first-world-war-and-richmond-park | title=The First World War and Richmond Park | publisher=The Hearsum Collection | work=The Collection | date=2014 | accessdate=19 May 2014}}</ref><ref>Cloake, p. 198</ref> When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.<ref name= McDowall71-78/>

The Freebord or "deer leap" is a strip of land 5m (16'6") wide, running around most of the perimeter of the park. Owned by the Crown, it allows access to the outside of the boundary wall for inspection and repairs.

===Holly Lodge===

In 1735, a new lodge, Cooper's Lodge, was built on the site of Hill Farm.<ref name="FRP Guide96">{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Michael Davison|publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=96|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}</ref> It was later known as Lucas's Lodge and  as Bog Lodge.<ref name ="FRP Guide96"/> Bog Lodge was renamed Holly Lodge in 1993<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 22"> Pollard and Crompton, p. 22</ref> and now contains a visitors' centre (bookings only), the Park's administrative headquarters and a base for the Metropolitan Police's Royal Parks Operational Command Unit.

Holly Lodge also includes the Holly Lodge Centre, an organisation which provides an opportunity for people of all ages and abilities to enjoy and learn from a series of hands-on experiences, focusing particularly on the environment and in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] history and heritage of Richmond Park. The Centre, which is [[wheelchair-accessible]] throughout,<ref name="Facilities">{{cite web | url=http://www.thehollylodgecentre.org.uk/facilities.shtml | title=Facilties on site | publisher=Holly Lodge Centre | accessdate=1 October 2013}}</ref> was opened in 1994.<ref name="Famous"/> It was founded by Mike Fitt OBE,<ref name="Famous"/> who was then The Royal Parks' Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London's Royal Parks.

===Pembroke Lodge===
{{Main|Pembroke Lodge}}
[[File:Pembroke Lodge 10233-5.jpg|thumb|260px| [[Pembroke Lodge]]]]
[[Pembroke Lodge]] and some associated houses stand in their own garden within the park. In 1847 Pembroke Lodge became the home of the then [[Prime Minister]], [[Lord John Russell]] and was later the childhood home of his grandson, [[Bertrand Russell]]. It is now a popular restaurant with views across the Thames Valley.

===Thatched House Lodge===
{{Main|Thatched House Lodge}}
Thatched House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] during the Second World War. Since 1963 it has been the residence of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge. Enlarged in 1727, the two houses were joined and renamed Thatched House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane. The gardens include an 18th-century two-room [[Thatching|thatched]] summer house which gave the main house its name.

===White Lodge===
[[File:White Lodge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[White Lodge, Richmond Park|White Lodge]]]]
{{Main|White Lodge}}
Built as a hunting lodge for [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] by the architect [[Roger Morris (1695<U+2013>1749)|Roger Morris]], White Lodge was completed in 1730. Its many famous residents have included members of the Royal Family. The future Edward VIII was born at White Lodge in 1894<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43018 |title=Parishes: Richmond (anciently Sheen) |author=Malden, H. E.

The [[Royal Ballet School]] (formerly Sadler's Wells Ballet) has been based since 1955<ref name= "Cloake 201"/> at [[White Lodge]] where younger ballet students continue to be trained.

===Other buildings===
Oak Lodge, near Sidmouth Wood, was built in about 1852 as a home for the park bailiff, who was responsible for repair and maintenance in the park.<ref name="FRP Guide101">{{cite book | title=''"Buildings" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | publisher=[[Richmond Park#Friends of Richmond Park|Friends of Richmond Park]] | author=Michael Davison | authorlink=Buildings | year=2011 | pages=101 | isbn=978 09567469 0 0}}</ref> It is used by The Royal Parks as its base for a similar function today.<ref name="FRP Guide101"/>

There are also gate lodges at Bishops Gate, Chohole Gate, Kingston Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate<ref name="Roehampton Gate">{{cite web | url= http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/676527 | title=Richmond Park: Roehampton Gate and Lodge | publisher=Geograph | accessdate=8 October 2012 | author=Nigel Cox}}</ref> and at Sheen Gate, which also has a [[bungalow]] (Sheen Gate Bungalow).<ref name ="Living in the Royal Parks">{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/park-management/licences-and-permits/living-in-the-royal-parks | title=Living in the Parks | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> Ladderstile Cottage, at Ladderstile Gate, was built in the 1780s.<ref name = "McDowall 73">McDowall, p. 73</ref>

Several buildings already existed within the park when it was created. One of these was a manor house at Petersham which was renamed Petersham Lodge. During the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period it became accommodation for one of the park's deputy keepers, [[Lodowick Carlell]] (or Carlile), who was also a renowned playwright in his day,<ref>McDowall, p. 47</ref> and his wife, [[Joan Carlile]], one of the very first women to practise painting professionally.<ref name="Toynbee and Isham">{{cite journal | url= http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/871403?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=2110115572130 | title=Joan Carlile (1606?<U+2013>1679): An Identification | work=Documents concerning artistic associates of Santa Maria della Scala | authors=Margaret Toynbee and Gyles Isham | work= [[The Burlington Magazine]]|volume= 96|number= 618 |date= September 1954 |accessdate =16 October 2012}}</ref>

Elizabeth, [[Countess of Dysart]], and her husband [[Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet|Sir Lionel Tollemache]], took over Petersham Lodge when they became joint keepers of Richmond Park. After Tollemache's death the Lodge and its surrounding land were leased in 1686 to [[Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester]], whose sister [[Anne Hyde|Anne]] was married to the new king, [[James II]]. It became a private park and was subsequently landscaped. By 1692 Rochester had demolished the Lodge and replaced it with a splendid new mansion in his "New Park". In 1732, a new Petersham Lodge was built to replace it after a fire.<ref>Cloake, p. 28</ref> This Petersham Lodge was demolished in 1835.<ref name = "Cloake 190"/>

Professor [[Sir Richard Owen]], the first Director of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], lived at Sheen Cottage until his death in 1892.<ref name="Victorian scientist">{{cite news | url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/news/452137.Remembering_Victorian_scientist/ | title=Remembering Victorian scientist | work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] | author=James Adlam|date=22 January 2004 | accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> The cottage was destroyed by enemy action in 1944.<ref>McDowall, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> The remains of the cottage can be seen in patches and irregularities in the wall 220 metres from Sheen Gate.<ref name = "McDowall 73"/>

A [[bandstand]], similar to one in [[Kensington Gardens]],  was erected near Richmond Gate in 1931. In 1975, after many years of disuse, it was moved to [[Regent's Park]].<ref name="Photographs86">{{cite book | title=Richmond in Old Photographs | publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing | editor=[[John Cloake]]  |author=Compiled by members of the [[Richmond, London#Societies|Richmond Local History Society]] | page= 86 |year = 1990| isbn=0-86299-855-7}}</ref>

===King Henry's Mound===
King Henry's Mound is the highest point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. It was probably a prehistoric burial chamber, possibly dating from the [[Bronze age]], and was later used as a viewpoint for hunting and [[falconry]].<ref name="Monuments"/>

The mound is named after [[Henry VIII of England]]. It was traditionally thought to be the spot where King Henry VIII stood on 19 May 1536 to watch a rocket fired from the Tower of London. This was the signal that his wife [[Anne Boleyn]] had been executed for treason and he would be able to marry [[Jane Seymour]]. The story is unlikely to be true because Henry spent that evening in Wiltshire.<ref name="Monuments">{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/press-and-media/factsheets-on-the-royal-parks/monuments/monuments-in-richmond-park| title=Monuments in Richmond Park | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>

To the west of King Henry's Mound is a [[panorama]] of the [[Thames]] Valley.<ref name="Viewpoints"/> St Paul's Cathedral, over 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) to the east, can be seen through the naked eye or via a [[telescope]] that has been installed on the Mound.

The park's open slopes and woods are based on lowland [[acid soils]]. The grassland is mostly managed by grazing. The park contains numerous woods and copses, some created with donations from members of the public.

Between 1819 and 1835, Lord Sidmouth, Deputy Ranger, established several new plantations and enclosures, including Sidmouth Wood and the ornamental [[Isabella Plantation]], both of which are fenced to keep the deer out.<ref name= "Landscape History"/><ref name = "Cloake 196"/> After World War II the existing woodland at Isabella Plantation was transformed into a woodland garden, and is organically run, resulting in a rich flora and fauna. Opened to the public in 1953,<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 32"> Pollard and Crompton, p. 32</ref>  it is now a major visitor attraction in its own right.  It is best known for the flowering, in April and May, of its [[evergreen]] [[azaleas]] and [[camellias]], which have been planted next to its ponds and streams. There are also many rare and unusual trees and shrubs.<ref name="TRP Isabella">{{cite web | url=https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond-park/richmond-park-attractions/isabella-plantation | title=Isabella Plantation | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | work=Richmond Park | accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref>

Their daughter Mary married [[George V]].<ref name="McDowall 70"/> Tercentenary Plantation, in 1937,<ref name= "McDowall 122"/> marked the 300th anniversary of the enclosure of the park. Victory Plantation was established in 1946<ref name= "McDowall 122"/> to mark the end of the Second World War. Queen Mother's Copse, a small triangular enclosure on the woodland hill halfway between Robin Hood Gate and Ham Gate, was established in 1980<ref name= "McDowall 122"/> to commemorate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

The park lost over 1000 mature trees during the storms of 1987 and 1990.<ref name="English Heritage list"/> The subsequent replanting included a new plantation, Two Storms Wood,<ref name="English Heritage list"/> a short distance into the park from Sheen Gate.

Bone Copse, which was named in 2005, was started by the Bone family in 1988 by purchasing and planting a tree from the Park authorities in memory of Bessie Bone who died in that year. Trees have been added annually, and in 1994 her husband Frederick Bone also died. The annual planting has been continued by their children.

[[File:Ian Dury-Memorial Bench.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Ian Dury]] [[memorial bench]]]]
In 1994 a curved metal bench, known as "Poet's seat",  was installed at the north end of Pembroke Lodge Gardens, at a viewpoint overlooking Petersham Park in the area known as Poet's Corner. Sculpted by Richard Farringdon,<ref name="Farringdon">{{cite web | url=http://www.richardfarrington.com/seats_richmond.htm | title=Richmond <U+2013> Poet's Seat | publisher= Richard Farringdon: Sculptor | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> it was based on an idea by Jane Fowles who worked with LUC (Land Use Consultants). The seat is inscribed with lines by [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]], the 18th century Scottish poet best known for writing the words to "[[Rule Britannia!]]" who, towards the end of his life, lived in Richmond.<ref name="Monuments"/>

At the north eastern end of Pembroke Lodge Gardens there was another memorial to Thomson, who died at Richmond in 1748. This was a black wooden board, originally installed in 1851 as two boards attached to trees near Pembroke Lodge stables. A newer version of the board was erected in 1895 by the Selbourne Society. The board had an [[ode]] to Thomson by the writer and historian [[John Heneage Jesse]].<ref name="Monuments"/>

In 2014 Poet's Corner was re-sited to the other side of the main path and the ode, on  a regilded board, was installed in a completely new oak frame. The new Poet's Corner, funded by the Friends of Richmond Park and the Visitor Centre at Pembroke Lodge, and by a donation in memory of Wendy Vachell, also includes three curved benches made from reclaimed [[teak]]. The benches are inscribed with a couplet by the Welsh poet [[W. H. Davies]], "A poor life this, if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare".<ref name="New Poet's Corner">{{cite journal | title=New Poet's Corner | journal=Friends of Richmond Park newsletter |date=Autumn 2014  | page=6}}</ref>

Lines from Thomson's best-known poem, "The Seasons", are inscribed on King Henry's Mound.<ref name="Monuments"/>

===Ian Dury===

In 2002 a "musical bench", designed by Mil Stricevic,<ref name="Stricevic">{{cite web | url=http://www.milstricevic.net/pages/reasons.html | title=Reasons to be Cheerful | publisher=Mil Stricevic | work=Sonic vista bench | accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> was placed in a favoured viewing spot of rock-and-roll singer and lyricist [[Ian Dury]] (1942<U+2013>2000) near Poet's Corner. The back of the bench is inscribed with the words "[[Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3|Reasons to be cheerful]]", the title of one of Dury's songs.<ref name="Monuments"/> The [[solar power]]ed seat was intended to allow visitors to plug in and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview, but has been subjected to repeated [[vandalism]].<ref name="Mirror">{{cite news | url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/the-blockheads-star-ian-durys-musical-203992 | title=The Blockheads star Ian Dury's musical memorial repeatedly vandalised in London's Richmond Park | work=[[Daily Mirror]] | location= London|date=26 February 2010 | accessdate=7 October 2012}}</ref>

The park is an important refuge for other wildlife, including [[woodpecker]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[snake]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, [[stag beetle]]s and many other [[insect]]s plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of [[fungi]]. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.<ref name=NNR/>

Richmond Park supports a large population of what are believed to be [[Rose-ringed Parakeet|Ring-necked (or Rose-ringed) Parakeets]]. These bred from birds that escaped or were freed from captivity.<ref name="McCarthy">{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/parakeets-cause-problems-for-british-wildlife-2165449.html | title=Parakeets cause problems for British wildlife | work=[[The Independent]] | date=20 December 2010 | accessdate=3 February 2015 | author=Michael McCarthy}}</ref>

==Ponds and streams==
There are about 30 ponds in the park. Some <U+2013> including Barn Wood Pond, Bishop's Pond, Gallows Pond, Leg of Mutton Pond, Martin's Pond and White Ash Pond <U+2013> have been created to drain the land or to provide water for livestock. The Pen Ponds (which in the past were used to rear [[carp]] for food)<ref name="FRP Guide16">{{cite book | title=''"Ecology" in'' Guide to Richmond Park | author=Nigel Reeve|publisher=[[Friends of Richmond Park]] | year=2011 | page=16|ISBN=978-0-9567469-0-0}}</ref> date from 1746.<ref name="Landscape History">{{cite web | url=http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/richmond_park/landscape_history.cfm | title=Landscape History | publisher=[[The Royal Parks]] | accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> They were formed when a trench was dug in the early 17th century to drain a boggy area; later in that century this was widened and deepened by the extraction of gravel for local building. The Ponds now take in water from streams flowing from the higher ground around them and release it to [[Beverley Brook]]. Beverley Brook and the two Pen Ponds are most visible areas of water in the park.<ref name="Davison">{{cite web | url=http://www.frp.org.uk/pdf/frp/401_Water_in_the_Park_.pdf | title=Water in the Park | publisher=Friends of Richmond Park | accessdate=7 February 2015 | author=Michael Davison}}</ref>

Beverley Brook rises at Cuddington Recreation Park in [[Worcester Park]]<ref name=inwood>{{cite book | title=Historic London: An Explorer's Companion | author= Stephen Inwood | publisher=[[Pan Macmillan]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-230-70598-7 | page=382 }}</ref> and enters the park (where it is followed by the Tamsin Trail and Beverley Walk) at Robin Hood Gate, creating a water feature used by deer, smaller animals and water grasses and some [[Nymphaeaceae|water lilies]].  Its name is derived from the former presence in the river of the [[European beaver]] (''Castor fiber''),<ref>{{cite book | title=Place-names of Greater London | author=John Field | publisher=[[Batsford]] | year=1980 | isbn=0-7134-2538-5 | pages=30,166}}</ref> a species extinct in Britain since the sixteenth century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castorologia: Or The History and Traditions of the Canadian Beaver |author= Horace T.

Most of the streams in the park drain into Beverley Brook but a spring above Dann's Pond flows to join [[Sudbrook (stream)|Sudbrook]] (from "South brook") on the park boundary. Sudbrook flows through a small valley known as Ham Dip and has been dammed and enlarged in two places to form Ham Dip Pond and Ham Gate Pond, first mapped in 1861 and 1754 respectively. These were created for the watering of deer.<ref>McDowall, pp. 131<U+2013>132</ref> Both ponds underwent restoration work including de-silting, which was completed in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.frp.org.uk/news/225-work-starts-on-more-ponds |year=2012 |title=Work starts on more ponds |publisher=Friends of Richmond Park |accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref> Sudbrook drains the western [[escarpment]] of the hill that, to the east, forms part of the catchment of Beverley Brook and, to the south, the [[Hogsmill River]]. Sudbrook is joined by the Latchmere Stream just beyond Ham Gate Pond. Sudbrook then flows into Sudbrook Park, Petersham. Another stream rises north of Sidmouth Wood and goes through Conduit Wood towards the park boundary near Bog Gate.<ref name="Davison"/>

A separate water system for Isabella Plantation was developed in the 1950s. Water from the upper Pen Pond is pumped to Still Pond, Thomson's Pond and Peg's Pond.<ref name="Davison"/>

==Sport and recreation==
''Cycling'': Cycles are available for hire near Roehampton Gate and, at peak times, near Pembroke Lodge.<ref name="Sport"/> The Tamsin Trail (shared between pedestrians and cyclists) provides a circuit of the park and is almost entirely car-free.<ref name="Tamsin Trail">{{cite web | url=http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/tamsin-trail-richmond-park | title=Tamsin Trail, Richmond Park | publisher=[[Sustrans]] | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

'''The Friends of Richmond Park''' (FRP) was founded in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the [[speed limit]] in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 miles an hour and there were concerns that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 2-3">Pollard and Crompton, pp. 2-3</ref> In 1969, plans by the then [[Greater London Council]] to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn.<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 9">Pollard and Crompton, p. 9</ref> The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles an hour in the summer of 2004.<ref name= "Pollard and Crompton 33">Pollard and Crompton, p. 33</ref>
