==Family history==
Alexey Mikhailovich Ridiger was born in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]. His father Mikhail Ridiger (1902<U+2013>1962), born in [[Saint Petersburg]], was a descendant of a [[Baltic German]] family.  His ancestor Captain Heinrich Nicolaus (Nils) R<U+00FC>dinger, the commander of a Swedish fortification in [[D<U+00FC>nam<U+00FC>nde]], [[Swedish Livonia]], was knighted by [[Charles XI of Sweden]] in 1695. After [[Swedish Estonia]] and Swedish Livonia became part of the [[Russian Empire]] in the aftermath of the [[Great Northern War]] in the beginning of the 18th century, another forefather of Alexy II, Friedrich Wilhelm von R<U+00FC>diger (1780<U+2013>1840), adopted Orthodox Christianity during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]]. From the marriage with Darya Fyodorovna Yerzhemsky<ref>The spelling of the names here is [[transliteration]] from Russian in the Patriarch's official biography - [http://www.pravenc.ru/text/64696.html <U+0410><U+041B><U+0415><U+041A><U+0421><U+0418><U+0419> II] ''Orthodox Encyclopaedia'' (2000)</ref> was born the future Patriarch's great-grandfather, Yegor (Georgi) von R<U+00FC>diger (1811<U+2013>1848).<ref name="PSS">{{cite news |first=Aarne |last=Veedla |language=[[Estonian language|Estonian]] |coauthors= |title=Patriarhi suguv<U+00F5>sa saladused |url=http://www.ekspress.ee/2008/12/05/varia/5735-patriarhi-suguvosa-saladused |work= |publisher=ekspress.ee |date=04.02.2003 |accessdate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>

After the Russian [[October Revolution]] in 1917, Alexey Ridiger's father Mikhail became a refugee and the family settled in Estonia, first in [[Haapsalu]] where a shelter was provided by priest Ralph von zur M<U+00FC>hlen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muuseum.haapsalu.ee/index.php?aasta=19&lk=40 |language=[[Estonian language|Estonian]]|title=Chronology |accessdate=December 5, 2008  |publisher=Museum of Laanemaa}}</ref>
Later Mikhail moved to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, where he met and married in 1926 Yelena Iosifovna Pisareva (1902<U+2013>1959),<ref name="PSS"/> who was born and later died there.<ref name="BN"/>

Alexey Ridiger's father graduated from the theological seminary in Tallinn in 1940 and was ordained a deacon and later a priest and served as the [[rector]] of the Church of the Nativity of the Mother of God in Tallinn. Later, he was a member and the chairman of the Diocesan Council in Estonia.

From 1986 until his election as Patriarch, he was [[Archbishop of Novgorod|Metropolitan of Novgorod]] and Leningrad.  After the death of [[Patriarch Pimen I]] in 1990 Alexiy was chosen to become the new Patriarch of The Russian Orthodox Church.  He was chosen on the basis of his administrative experience, and was considered "intelligent, energetic, hardworking, systematic, perceptive, and businesslike."<ref>Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003),p 85.</ref> He also "had a reputation as a conciliator, a person who could find common ground with various groups in the episcopate."<ref name="autogenerated3">Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003),p 86.</ref> Archbishop Chrysostom (Martyshkin) remarked "With his peaceful and tolerant disposition Patriarch Aleksi will be able to unite us all."<ref>Zhurnal Moskovskoi Patriarkhii, No. 10 (October), 1990, p.16, quoted in Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003),p 284.</ref>

Patriarch Alexy II was "the first patriarch in Soviet history to be chosen without government pressure; candidates were nominated from the floor, and the election was conducted by secret ballot."<ref name="autogenerated5" />

Upon taking on the role of Patriarch, Patriarch Alexy became a vocal advocate of the rights of the church, calling for the Soviet government to allow religious education in the state schools and for a <U+201C>freedom of conscience<U+201D> law.<ref name="autogenerated5" />  During the attempted coup in August 1991, he denounced the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev, and anathematized the plotters.<ref name="autogenerated5" /> He publicly questioned the junta's legitimacy, called for restraint by the military, and demanded that Gorbachev be allowed to address the people.<ref>Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003),p 96.</ref> He issued a second appeal against violence and fratricide, which was amplified over loudspeakers to the troops outside the Russian "White House" half an hour before they attacked.<ref name="autogenerated3" /> Ultimately, the coup failed, which eventually resulted in the breakup of the Soviet Union.<ref>Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy, 2nd Edition.(Oxford: Westview Press, 2003),p 97.</ref>

In July 1998 Alexy II decided not to officiate in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] of [[Saint Petersburg]] at the burial of the royal family murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918, a ceremony attended by President [[Boris Yeltsin]], citing doubts about the authenticity of the remains.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/133725.stm</ref>

Patriarch Alexy II repeatedly affirmed the traditional stand of the Orthodox Church and opposed the display of homosexuality in Russia, and in particular, opposed gay parades in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Church, according to the Patriarch, "has invariably supported the institution of the family and condemns untraditional relations, seeing them as a vicious deviation from God-given human nature". He also said, "I am convinced that gays' desire to organize a parade in Moscow will not help strengthen the family as the foundation of a strong state".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=1164 |title=Interfax-Religion |publisher=Interfax-religion.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref> He also said that homosexuality is an illness and a distortion of the human personality like kleptomania.<ref>{{cite web|last=Castle |first=Stephen |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/10/02/africa/church.php |title=Patriarch Alexy of Russia assails gays in speech at Council of Europe - International Herald Tribune |publisher=Iht.com |date= |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Updated |first=Last |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=RFBLLGOXBYBQNQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2007/10/03/wgay103.xml |title=Gay people are ill, says Russian patriarch - Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-12-09}}</ref>

[[Moskovskie Novosti]] has alleged that according to a denunciation written by a priest-inspector Pariysky to the Leningrad Council of Religious Affairs, the marriage had been expedited in order for Ridiger to become a [[deacon]] and avoid being [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet Military]] (marriage is impossible after [[ordination]] in Orthodoxy).

The Moscow Patriarchate has, however, consistently denied that Patriarch Alexy was in fact a KGB Agent.<ref>"Official spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchy Father Vsevolod Chaplin labeled such reports as "absolutely unsubstantiated" in a Wednesday interview with Interfax. "There is no data indicating that Patriarch Alexy II was an associate of the special services, and no classified documents bear his signature," he said. "I do not think that direct dialogue between the current patriarch and KGB took place," Father Vsevolod continued. However, "all bishops communicated with representatives of the council for religious matters in the Soviet government, which was inevitable, since any issue, even the most insignificant one, had to be resolved through this body. It is quite another matter that the council forwarded all its materials to the KGB," he said." [http://www.stetson.edu/~psteeves/relnews/0009b.html Moscow Patriarchate Rejects Times Report of Alexy II'S Collaboration with KGB, Sept 20, 2000 (Interfax)] "Chaplin, the church spokesman, said in March, "Nobody has ever seen a single real document that would confirm the patriarch used his contacts with Soviet authorities to make harm to the church or to any people in the church."

In none of them is there the slightest evidence that the individuals we are talking about knew that these documents were being drawn up, or gave their consent. So I don't think any reasonably authoritative clerical or secular commission could see these papers as proof of anything.'", Russian Patriarch 'was KGB spy', The Guardian (London) , February 12, 1999</ref>  Konstanin Kharchev, former chairman of Soviet Council on Religious Affairs, explained: ''"Not a single candidate for the office of bishop or any other high-ranking office, much less a member of Holy Synod, went through without confirmation by the Central Committee of the [[CPSU]] and the [[KGB]]"''.<ref name="Albats"/> Professor Nathaniel Davis points out: "If the bishops wished to defend their people and survive in office, they had to collaborate to some degree with the KGB, with the commissioners of the Council for Religious Affairs, and with other party and governmental authorities."<ref> Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy,(Oxford: Westview Press, 1995),p .96 Davis quotes one bishop as saying: "Yes, we -- I, at least, and I say this first about myself -- I worked together with the KGB. I cooperated, I made signed statements, I had regular meetings, I made reports. I was given a pseudonym -- a code name as they say there... I knowingly cooperated with them -- but in such a way that I undeviatingly tried to maintain the position of my Church, and, yes, also to act as a patriot, insofar as I understood, in collaboration with these organs. I was never a stool pigeon, nor an informer."</ref>

Patriarch Alexy has, acknowledged that compromises were made with the Soviet government by bishops of the Moscow Patriarchate, himself included, and publicly repented of these compromises:

:''"Defending one thing, it was necessary to give somewhere else. Were there any other organizations, or any other people among those who had to carry responsibility not only for themselves but for thousands of other fates, who in those years in the Soviet Union were not compelled to act likewise? Before those people, however, to whom the compromises, silence, forced passivity or expressions of loyalty permitted by the leaders of the church in those years caused pain, before these people, and not only before God, I ask forgiveness, understanding and prayers."''<ref>From an interview of Patriarch Alexy II, given to "Izvestia" No 137, June 10, 1991, entitled "Patriarch Alexy II: -- I Take upon Myself Responsibility for All that Happened", English translation from Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy,(Oxford: Westview Press, 1995),p 89.

According to Nathaniel Davis, when asked by the Russian press about claims that he was a "compliant" bishop, "Aleksi defended his record, noting that while he was bishop of Tallinn in 1961, he resisted the communist authorities' efforts to make the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in the city a planetarium (which, in truth, they did do elsewhere in the Baltic states) and to convert the Pyukhtitsa Dormition nunnery to a rest home for miners."<ref> Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy,(Oxford: Westview Press, 1995),p. 89f </ref> Official records show that the Tallinn diocese had a lower number of forced Church closings than was typical in the rest of the USSR during Patriarch Alexy's tenure as bishop there. <ref> Nathaniel Davis, A Long Walk to Church: A Contemporary History of Russian Orthodoxy,(Oxford: Westview Press, 1995), fn. 115, p. 272 </ref> Timothy Ware notes, "Opinions differ over the past collaboration or otherwise between the Communist authorities, but on the whole he is thought to have shown firmness and independence in his dealings as a diocesan bishop with the Soviet State."<ref>Timothy Ware, The Orthodox Church, New Edition, (London: Penguin Books, 1997), p. 164</ref>

==Opinions about Alexy II==

*According to Russia's Prime-minister '''[[Vladimir Putin]]''': "Patriarch Alexy II had been a prominent figure in the history of the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as a great [[statesman]]... he made a very considerable contribution to relations between various faiths. It would not be an exaggeration to say that he had friendly relations with representatives of all traditional faiths in Russia". Putin also acknowledged that Alexy II "did a great deal to help establish a new governance system in Russia".<ref>{{cite news |title=Death of Alexy II a tragic and sorrowful event - Putin |url=http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&div=5458|publisher=[[Interfax.ru]] |date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=December 10, 2008}}</ref>

*On the day of Alexy II death the '''[[BBC]]''' said: "Patriarch Alexiy II had an extraordinary career, in which he switched from suppressing the Russian Orthodox Church to being its champion. A favourite of the [[KGB]], he was promoted rapidly through the Church hierarchy, doing the [[Kremlin]]'s bidding at a time when [[Soviet dissidents|dissident]] priests were [[Incarceration|thrown into jail]]. As the Church's effective foreign minister, he helped [[Cover-up|cover up]] the repression of [[Religion in the Soviet Union|Russian Christians]], defending the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet system]] to the outside world. He rose quickly through the ranks, being elected head of the Russian Orthodox Church at a crucial time, in 1990, with the [[Soviet Union]] on [[History of the Soviet Union (1985<U+2013>1991)|the path to]] collapse. Surprisingly, perhaps, he seized the moment, and went on to oversee the revival and flowering of the Church."<ref name="BBCBordeaux">{{cite news |title=Double life of Russia's patriarch |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7767015.stm|work=[[BBC]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-12-05 |accessdate=December 7, 2008 }}</ref>
