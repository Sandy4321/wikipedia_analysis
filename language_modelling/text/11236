'''Goldmoon''' (also known as ''Goldmoon of the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Que Shu|Que Shu]] tribe'' or just ''Goldmoon of the Que Shu'') is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Dragonlance]]'' fantasy series of [[List of Dragonlance novels|novels]] and [[Role-playing game|role playing games]], originally published by [[TSR, Inc.]] and later by [[Wizards of the Coast]].

Introduced in the first book of the original [[List of Dragonlance novels#Chronicles Trilogy|Chronicles Trilogy]], ''[[Dragons of Autumn Twilight]]'', written by [[Margaret Weis]] and [[Tracy Hickman]] in 1984; Goldmoon has became a recurring character for over 16 years in multiple ''Dragonlance'' novels and series, either as a protagonist or as a supporting character.

==Character background==
According to Patrick Lucien Price, author of the "Bertrem's essay on numerology" section published in ''Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home'' (1987), Goldmoon was designed to be a kind and understanding female [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|barbarian]], who loved to travel, advise, and take care of others. As a high profile member of her community, she was a natural speaker, able to inspire others to reach for their goals.<ref name="personality">

The ''Dragonlance'' novels do not cover Goldmoon's childhood, although her birth date, February 5, 322 [[Dragonlance timeline|A.C.]] (''Alt Cataclius'' or ''After Cataclysm'') can be found in the ''Leaves from the Inn of the Last Home'' source book.<ref name="personality" /> Different novels and short stories agree that her parents are Arrowthorn, [[tribal chief|Chieftain]] of the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Que Shu|Que Shu]]<U+2014>a tribe located in the plains of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Abanasinia|Abanasinia]], a desolate area in the central western area of [[Ansalon]] in the fictional world of [[Krynn]]<U+2014>and Tearsong, deceased high priestess of the tribe.

The [[short story]] "Heart of Goldmoon", written by Laura Hickman and [[Kate Novak]] and published in the ''Love and War'' (1987) recompilation, gives insight about her life after her mother died, explaining that the Que Shu community is built around the figure of a high priestess, and whoever marries the priestess becomes Chieftain of the tribe, with the first daughter of the couple becoming the next priestess.<ref name="highpriestess">

The focus of the story is Goldmoon journeying to the ''Hall of the Sleeping Spirits'', the place where the tombs of her ancestors are kept, to commune with their spirits in order to become the high priestess of the tribe. The journey ends with an exchange of confirmation of love between Goldmoon and Riverwind, a shepherd who was acting as her bodyguard during the travel, as well as the meeting between Goldmoon and Tearsong's spirit, in which Goldmoon is taught about the ancient gods and given a task in the name of [[Mishakal]], goddess of healing, which she later fulfills.<ref name="firsttask">

Reappearing just outside the city of [[List of Dragonlance locations#Solace|Solace]], they decide to travel, to look for someone who could tell them more about the staff, which marks the proper beginning of the ''Chronicles'' trilogy.

==Development through the series==
===Chronicles trilogy===
{{see also|War of the Lance}}
Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman introduce Goldmoon in chapter 3 of ''Dragons of Autumn Twilight'' (1984), titled ''"Knight of Solamnia. The old man's party."'' She is presented as a heavily cloaked, silvery-gold haired woman carrying a plain staff, accompanied by a tall stone-faced barbarian. The authors explain that shortly after their arrival to the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Inn of the Last Home|Inn of the Last Home]] a fight breaks out and the true nature of her [[List of Dragonlance artifacts#Blue Crystal Staff|healing staff]] is revealed, forcing the barbarians and a group of friends to run away. It is after escaping with the barbarians that the friends realize Goldmoon's desire of traveling to [[List of Dragonlance locations#Haven|Haven]], where she hoped the ''Seekers'', priests who were in search of the old gods but degenerated into a political movement, would be able to teach her about the healing staff.

In the following chapters, Weis and Hickman continue to make the female barbarian the main focus of the story, stating that she discovered two [[Night Sky of Krynn|constellations]] were missing from the firmament, and then revisiting when the staff protected Riverwind when the tribe was going to stone him. However, her protagonism fades in the battle sequences that follow, where she is protected by Riverwind, [[Sturm Brightblade]], a [[Knights of Solamnia#Squirehood|Squire of the Knights of Solamnia]] and [[Tanis Half-Elven]], the leader of the group. This behavior becomes constant throughout the rest of the series.

The authors give the story a harder push when they explain the group, later known as the [[Heroes of the Lance]], travels to [[List of Dragonlance locations#Xak Tsaroth|Xak Tsaroth]], which is the broken city where Riverwind previously found the magical staff. The sixteenth chapter, ''"A bitter choice. The greatest gift."'' presents the earlier conversation between Goldmoon and her deceased mother, Tearsong, and an appearance of [[Mishakal]], goddess of healing and protector of the ''Blue Crystal Staff'' Goldmoon carries, in which she explains the different sacrifices Goldmoon must do in order to obtain the goddess' gift and the tasks she must fulfill, including the retrieval of the [[List of Dragonlance artifacts#Disks of Mishakal|Disks of Mishakal]], a sacred book of platinum with the teachings of [[Paladine (Dragonlance)|Paladine]], highest god of light in [[Krynn]] within it.<ref name="mishakal">

The novel continues, indicating that Goldmoon receives the power of healing before the goddess departs, which Goldmoon promptly uses to save a mortally wounded Riverwind after an encounter against [[Khisanth]], a [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|black dragon]] protecting the broken city.

Goldmoon reaches the peak of attention when the authors write about her apparent sacrifice to defeat Khisanth, during the retrieval of the ''Disks of Mishakal''. However, it is soon explained that her sacrifice was the last test the goddess Mishakal needed from her, and as the group nears the exit of the dungeon, they find Goldmoon waiting for them, blessed by the deity as a true cleric of Mishakal with the power of calling upon Mishakal's help when in need.<ref name="sacrifice">

Fulfilling her final mission, Goldmoon delivers the ''Disks of Mishakal'' to a former ''Seeker'', [[List of Dragonlance characters#Elistan|Elistan]], whom the group meets in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Pax Tharkas|Pax Tharkas]] after they have been captured by the [[Dragonarmies of Ansalon]], the forces of evil invading the continent of Ansalon.

Her involvement in the last two books of the trilogy<U+2014>and therefore during the [[War of the Lance]]<U+2014>abruptly diminishes at the beginning of the second book, ''[[Dragons of Winter Night]]'' (1985). Her appearances are mostly to give counsel, spread the teachings of Mishakal and order new clerics. During the second half of the last book, ''[[Dragons of Spring Dawning]]'' (1985), Goldmoon learns she is pregnant. Her goodbye to [[Laurana Kanan]] in [[List of Dragonlance locations#Kalaman|Kalaman]] is the last apparition in the Chronicles trilogy.

According to Tracy Hickman, ''"The restoration of truth and faith are Goldmoon's central theme and, to a great extent, the theme of this first book in the series."''<ref name="theme">

===Legends trilogy===
Although the series focus heavily on [[Caramon Majere|Caramon]] and [[Raistlin Majere]], Riverwind makes an appearance at the beginning of the first book of the ''Legends'' trilogy, ''Time of the Twins'' (1986), written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and published by TSR, in which he is recognized as leader of the Que Shu and other barbarian tribes by wearing the ''Mantle of the Chieftain''.

This apparition is also used by the authors to explain the current situation of the couple. With a two year old son<U+2014>[[List of Dragonlance characters#Wanderer|Wanderer]]<U+2014>and twin daughters<U+2014>[[List of Dragonlance characters#Moonsong|Moonsong]] and [[List of Dragonlance characters#Brightdawn|Brightdawn]]<U+2014>the couple have worked hard to join the different tribes of Abanasinia, their homeland. It is finally explained that Goldmoon is spreading the teachings of her patron deity there, but nothing more is said about her.

===Chaos War series===
Goldmoon was not specifically included in the [[Chaos War]], an event in which the mad god [[Chaos (Dragonlance)|Chaos]] tries to destroy the world of [[Krynn]]. However, in ''Spirit of the Wind'' (1998), Chris Pierson explains that Wanderer, Riverwind and Goldmoon's son, has a three year old son, Cloudhawk, but nobody remembers his mother. The author hints that Goldmoon's tribe was attacked by ''[[List of Dragonlance creatures#shadow wights|shadow wights]]'', chaotic creatures that banish anyone they possess to utter oblivion, destroying even memories from others about the person in question. This hint is given through Wanderer's sisters, Moonsong and Brightdawn, when they speculate that one such creature killed her.<ref name="shadowwight">

The novel ends with the death of Brightdawn and Riverwind while fighting the red dragon overlord [[Malystryx]], and Moonsong scarred forever, events that weighted heavily on Goldmoon's spirit.

The [[Dragonlance timeline#Age of Mortals|Age of Mortal]] starts at the end of ''Dragons of Summer Flame'' (1996) novel, with the departure of the [[List of Dragonlance deities|krynnish gods]] and the banishment of magic and clerical powers known to Krynn until that moment. Needing a new source of power, a special kind of magic named ''mysticism'' is created based on previous abilities found in the ''Dragonlance'' novels.<ref name="mysticism">

The novel continues explaining the different difficulties the group had to establish a camp, while at the same time introducing a branch of mysticism, ''dark mysticism'', which was discovered by Goldmoon's wish to talk with Riverwind. From that point Goldmoon continued using it to communicate with Riverwind's spirit, although conversations between the couple are usually kept secret from the reader. Other authors like Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman made use of that bond between the couple in subsequent books. 

By the end of the novel she has managed to found the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Citadel of Light|Citadel of Light]], which was established as the healing center of Ansalon.<ref name="dream">

Because of this, Goldmoon has been used by ''Dragonlance'' authors to first bring clerical healing back to Krynn during the [[Dragonlance timeline#Age of Despair|Fourth Age]], and then to bring mysticism during the [[Dragonlance timeline#Age of Mortals|Fifth Age]].<!-- The fact is mentioned in the books. {{citation needed}} --><!-- I know I have read this quote in the novels, will try to find it. -->

Goldmoon's most controversial appearance was in the [[List of Dragonlance novels#Dragons of a New Age|Dragons of a New Age]] trilogy, written by [[Jean Rabe]] between 1996 and 1998, in which it is related the coming of the ''Dragon Overlords'', [[Dragon (Dungeons & Dragons)|dragons]] of exceptional size and power, to the world of Krynn.

In ''The Dawning of a New Age'' (1996), the first book of the series, Jean Rabe indicates that Goldmoon appears as an illusion to [[List of Dragonlance characters#Dhamon Grimwulf|Dhamon Grimwulf]], a former Knight of Takhisis, summoning him to the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Last Heroes' Tomb|Last Heroes' Tomb]], the tomb where the heroes of the [[Chaos War]] are kept.

During the length of the book, Goldmoon appears as an encouraging voice when her friends need her. It is towards the end of the book when the author reveals how Goldmoon is brought back to Krynn, as Goldmoon tells a dying Jasper he was supposed to die in Schallsea, and that his faith and his death against Onysablet, the black dragon overlord, restores her life.<ref name="resurrection">

The initial shock is replaced with the unexplained urge of following the ''River of Souls'', also referred as the ''river of the dead'', the continuous stream of wandering souls moving towards an unknown meeting location. Goldmoon spends the end of the first book and most of the second book, ''Dragons of a Lost Star'' (2001), following the stream until arriving to [[List of Dragonlance locations#Nightlund|Nightlund]], where the [[Towers of High Sorcery#Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas|Tower of High Sorcery of Palanthas]] was hidden.

The final chapter of the second book relates the meeting between Goldmoon and an orphaned girl she found in the [[List of Dragonlance locations#Schallsea|Isle of Schallsea]] whom she had raised and trained in the clerical arts, [[Mina (Dragonlance)|Mina]]. Mina now serves the One God, or [[Takhisis]] in disguise, in her attempt to bring the "true gods" back to Krynn, like what Goldmoon did many years ago. During this meeting the reader is revealed that Goldmoon's body was restored by Takhisis, evil goddess of darkness, through Mina's prayer. However, refusing to become Takhisis' herald, the goddess drains the life out of Goldmoon and orders Mina to secure her corpse in an amber [[sarcophagus]].<ref name="death">

Her death puts an end to the [[Heroes of the Lance]], as she was the last surviving character from the original group created in 1984 by Weis and Hickman.

==Controversy==
The character of Goldmoon was killed in the [[List of Dragonlance novels#Dragons of a New Age|Dragons of a New Age]] trilogy, during events explained in ''The Day of the Tempest'' novel, and resurrected in the last novel of the series, ''The Eve of the Maelstrom''. In the ''Dragonlance'' environment, resurrection is extremely rare (with Beldinas Pilofiro, latest [[Kingpriest of Istar]], resurrecting Cathan MarSevrin with [[Paladine (Dragonlance)|Paladine]]'s intervention in ''[[Chosen of the Gods]]'' (2001),<ref name="cathan">

Although fans theorized about her death and resurrection, the matter was clarified by a mail sent to the ''Dragonlance'' list by Miranda Horner, [[Wizards of the Coast]] Web Content Developer, and a forum post in the official ''Dragonlance'' forums by [[Jean Rabe]], author of the trilogy.

According to Miranda Horner:<ref name="mhorner">{{cite web | url=http://oracle.wizards.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0006a&L=dragonlance-l&D=1&F=&S=&P=907 | date=2000-06-01 | accessdate=2007-12-30 | publisher=Dragonlance mailing list | title=Re: Jean Rabe and Goldmoon, a new perspective (I think and hope) was: Re: [DL] Populations in cities and towns?}}</ref>
{{cquote|The underlying thing was that it was rather confusing to come into, and it affected my project to some extent. Steve and I worked on Citadel, and I think he and Sue ended up having to change the stuff in there to make Goldmoon alive. I know that I had to adjust Wings of Fury to reflect book stuff, and books had to change Eve to reflect some game stuff.}}

[[Jean Rabe]] wrote in the official ''Dragonlance'' forums:<ref name="jrabe">{{cite web | last = Rabe | first = Jean | authorlink = Jean Rabe | title = On Goldmoon's "Tempest" Death | publisher=Dragonlance Forums | date = [[2005-01-11]] | url = http://dragonlanceforums.com/forums/showpost.php?p=40063&postcount=5 | accessdate = 2007-12-30}}</ref>
{{cquote|I <nowiki>[Jean Rabe]</nowiki> "killed" Goldmoon in Day of the Tempest, after getting approval from the books department and Margaret to do so. After the book was in typesetting, the games division called me and said she couldn't die, as they had plans for her in a DL game product. Since my novel was "work for hire," I had to bring Goldmoon back. Sigh. Argh. Just doing what they told me to do.}}

Synchronization problems between novels and gaming material, and even between novels themselves are common in the ''Dragonlance'' environment where, except in few cases, the novel authors do not assist in the creation of the [[Tabletop role-playing game|role playing game]] [[Module (role-playing games)|modules]].
