===Public Art===
Lum has worked on several public art projects. In Vienna in 2000, Lum realized a 540 square metre work on the side of the centrally located [[Kunsthalle Wien]]. The work, "There is no place like home," generated controversy as Lum saw the work as a response to the growth of the extreme right in Europe. 
Lum's ''Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White'' was installed upon the roof of the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] in 2001. The work, which can be viewed as a comment on [[immigration]] and [[acculturation]], features four [[model boat]]s: a [[First Nations]] [[longboat]], a [[cargo ship]], the [[Steamboat|steam liner]] ''[[Komagata Maru]]'', and [[George Vancouver|George Vancouver's]] ship [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']]. Each vessel has been placed at one of the building's compass points <U+2014> north, south, east, and west <U+2014> and painted in a colour intended to reflect the stereotyped [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] vision presented in the hymn "[[Christian child's prayer|Jesus Loves the Little Children]]".<ref>O'Brian, Melanie. (2001). ''Ken Lum: Four Boats Stranded: Red and Yellow, Black and White.'' [Brochure]. Vancouver, British Columbia: Vancouver Art Gallery.</ref>

Lum realized a second permanent [[public art]] commission outside [[St. Moritz]],<ref>[http://www.publicplaiv.ch/assets/pdf/staelum.pdf publicplaiv.ch]</ref> [[Switzerland]] in 2003 that dealt with the declining Romansch way of life in the remote Engadine region of Switzerland. The work titled ''Il Buolf Mus-chin Museum'' was a commission of the Walter A. Bechtler Foundation of Zurich and the Z<U+00FC>rcher Hochschule der K<U+00FC>nste.

In 2005, Lum completed "A Tale of Two Children: A Work for Strathcona," a permanent work commissioned by the City of Vancouver's Public Works Yard.  Another major public art commission by Lum, sponsored by he city of [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], and [[Wiener Linien]] (Vienna Public Transit), opened in downtown Vienna in January 2007.  Titled [[:de:Pi (Kunstprojekt)|Pi]], <ref>[http://www.publicartvienna.at/files_e/7.html publicartvienna.at]</ref> the work is over 130 meter long and situated in a prominent pedestrian passageway by Vienna's [[Karlsplatz]] subway interchange. In 2011, Lum realized a permanent public art commission for the city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], [[The Netherlands]].  The work is located in the Nieuw Welgelegen district,<ref>[http://www.utrecht.nl/smartsite.dws?id=317001district utrecht.nl]</ref> a troubled but dynamic multi-ethnic area of Utrecht that is undergoing redevelopment.  The work titled ''January 1, 1960'' consists of a monumentally scaled topographical and political globe of the world as it looked at the start of the year 1960.

In early 2010, Lum completed [[Monument for East Vancouver]]<ref>[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/cultural/publicart/2010/mm_vaneastmonument.htm vancouver.ca]</ref> a permanent outdoor artwork located in the traditionally working class side of Vancouver.  In Vancouver, he also realized ''From shangri-la to shangri-la'', a temporary installation based on huts that were erected on the Maplewood mudflats in [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (district municipality)|North Vancouver]] during the second half of the twentieth century. Scale models of these structures appear to float over the surface of a corporate reflecting pond, creating a marked juxtaposition between their makeshift construction and the surrounding architecture, while evoking the utopian character of the mudflat community in the seemingly inexorable advance of urban development.<ref>[http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_ken_lum.html vanartgallery.bc.ca]</ref> In mid-2010, Lum won a public art commission for 570 Bay Street in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].  Late in 2010, Lum was selected lead artist on the design team for the new [[Walterdale Bridge]] replacement scheduled for construction in 2013 and 2014 in [[Edmonton, Alberta]].
