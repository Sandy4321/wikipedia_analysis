==Biography==
===Early life===
May was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Georgia Tech, where he was a member of the [[ANAK Society]], an elite and secretive honor society.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/anak/grads/1980.html | title=ANAK Graduates, 1980-1989 | publisher=ANAK Society | accessdate=2010-04-28 }}</ref> May graduated in 1985 with a B.E.E. degree in [[electrical engineering]]. He then attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned an M.S. (1987) and Ph.D. (1991), both in electrical engineering and computer science.

===Georgia Tech===
May joined the Georgia Tech ECE faculty in 1991 as a member of the School's microelectronics group. His research is in the field of computer-aided manufacturing of integrated circuits. He was a National Science Foundation "National Young Investigator" (1993-98) and was Editor-in-Chief of ''IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing'' (1997-2001). He has authored over 200 articles and technical presentations in the area of IC computer-aided manufacturing. In 2001, he was named Motorola Foundation Professor, and was appointed associate chair for Faculty Development.

May is the founder of Georgia Tech's Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering/Science (SURE) program, a summer research program designed to attract talented minority students into graduate school. He also is the founder and director of Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and Science program (FACES), a program designed to encourage minority engagement in engineering and science careers. May was a National Science Foundation and an AT&T Bell Laboratories graduate fellow, and has worked as a member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ. He is a member of the National Advisory Board of the [[National Society of Black Engineers | National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)]].
