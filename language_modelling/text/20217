===The Memorandum Affair===
{{main|Memogate (Pakistan)}}
[[File:Kayani and Pasha.jpg|thumb|left|380px|Pasha (right) next to Gen. [[Ashfaq Kayani]] on the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] talking with [[Michael Mullen]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]]]
Gen. Pasha was involved in the [[Memogate (Pakistan)|Memogate]] controversy in 2011<U+2013>2012 in which an American businessman, [[Mansoor Ijaz]] alleged that a senior Pakistani diplomat, former [[Husain Haqqani|Amb. Husain Haqqani]], had asked him to deliver an unsigned memorandum to [[Michael Mullen|Adm. Mike Mullen]], chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time. The memorandum sought help of the Obama administration in the wake of the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|Abbottabad raid]] during which U.S. Special Forces killed Osama bin Laden. It asked the U.S. to help avert a military takeover of the civilian government in Pakistan, as well as assistance in executing a Washington insider takeover of the government and military apparatus of Pakistan.

On 10 October 2011, the London ''[[Financial Times]]'' published a Comment article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5ea9b804-f351-11e0-b11b-00144feab49a.html|title=Time to take on Pakistan's jihadist spies|last=Ijaz|first=Mansoor|work=[[Financial Times]]|date=10 October 2011}}</ref> in which the existence of the memorandum was disclosed,<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret memo on Pakistan to Adm. Mike Mullen|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/documents/secret-pakistan-memo-to-adm-mike-mullen.html|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|date=17 November 2011}}</ref> arguing that Pakistan's [[Inter-Service Intelligence|intelligence services]] were responsible for fueling jihadist insurgency in the country. On 22 October 2011, Pasha met Ijaz at the London Intercontinental hotel. The meeting lasted 4 hours, and started a chain of events that ended in a Supreme Court investigation of the Memorandum's origins, authenticity and purpose.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/web/user_files/File/Const.P.77-78-79%20%5BMemogate%5DDetailedOrder.pdf|title=Order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|date=30 December 2011}}</ref>

During the London meeting, Pasha was presented with evidence in the form of BlackBerry handset exchanges, written notes and call logs that pointed to the involvement of the senior Pakistani diplomat in the matter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cssforum.com.pk/general/news-articles/56727-when-mansoor-ijaz-met-shuja-pasha.html|title=When Mansoor Ijaz met Shuja Pasha|last=Ahmad|first=Fasih|publisher=''[[Newsweek Pakistan]]''|date=20 November 2011}}</ref> Haqqani continues to the present to deny any involvement in the origins, purpose or authenticity of the Memorandum.

On 5 April 2012, Pasha agreed to appear before the Judicial Commission constituted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to examine the available evidence in the memorandum affair. He testified that during the meeting in London, he was shown the same evidence as had appeared during the course of the previous three months of hearings and that he believed the evidence to be factual and authentic. He did not waiver in his stance about the purpose, origin or authenticity of the memorandum.

In June 2012, the Judicial Commission released its final conclusions and found that the alleged memorandum was authentic and that former ambassador Husain Haqqani was its "originator and architect". The report said he had in fact sought US support through the memo and wanted to head a new national security team in Pakistan. The report also stated that Haqqani was not loyal to Pakistan as he had left the country, had no material assets in Pakistan and was now living abroad. The Supreme Court, upon hearing the report in session, ordered the former ambassador to appear before the bench. The process of repatriating Haqqani to Pakistan for his appearance in front of the high court continues to the present day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-53857-Haqqani-sought-US-support-through-memo|title=Haqqani sought US support through memo|publisher=''The News International''|date=12 June 2012}}</ref>
