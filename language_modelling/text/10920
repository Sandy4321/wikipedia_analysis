The '''Shackleton<U+2013>Rowett Expedition''' (1921<U+2013>22) was the last [[Antarctic]] expedition led by [[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]], and the final episode in the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]]. The venture, financed by businessman [[John Quiller Rowett]], is sometimes referred to as the '''''Quest'' Expedition''' after its ship, a small converted Norwegian [[whaler]].

The original plan  was to  explore the [[Beaufort Sea]] sector of the [[Arctic Ocean]], but this was changed to the Antarctic after the Canadian government withheld financial support. The expedition objectives were never clearly formulated, but included broadly defined [[oceanographic]] and coastal survey work. The ship, smaller than those of any recent Antarctic voyage, proved inadequate for its task; its progress south was delayed by its poor performance and by frequent engine problems, which led to an enforced delay of a month in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died aboard ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of [[South Georgia]].

The major part of the subsequent foreshortened expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of second-in-command [[Frank Wild]]. In these waters the shortcomings of ''Quest''  were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than [[longitude]] 20<U+00B0>E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power was insufficient for it to penetrate far into the Antarctic ice. Following several fruitless attempts to break southwards through the [[pack ice]], Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, after a nostalgic visit to [[Elephant Island]], where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], during Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] six years earlier.

Wild had thoughts of a second, more productive season in the ice, and took the ship to [[Cape Town]] for a refit. Here he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. Although not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, the ''Quest'' voyage is of  historical significance, standing at the very end of the Heroic Age and the beginning of the "Mechanical Age"<ref name= Fisher446/> that followed it. Ultimately,  the event that defined it in public memory, and overshadowed all its activities, was Shackleton's untimely death.

==Background==
===After the ''Endurance''===
After helping to rescue the various stranded groups of men from his ''Endurance'' expedition, Shackleton came home to Britain in late May 1917, while [[World War I]] was raging. Too old to enlist, he nevertheless sought an active role in the war effort,<ref>Huntford, p. 649</ref> and eventually found himself bound for [[Murmansk]] with the temporary army rank of [[major]], as part of a military mission to North Russia. This role was not satisfying to Shackleton, and he expressed his dissatisfaction in  letters home: "I feel I am no use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild lands."<ref>Fisher, p. 435</ref>  He returned to England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the [[White Movement|North Russian Government]], develop the natural resources of the region.<ref>Fisher, p. 437</ref> This scheme came to nothing, as the [[Red Army]] took control of that part of Russia during the [[Russian Civil War]]; Shackleton was increasingly forced to rely on the lecture circuit to provide him with an income. At the Philharmonic Hall in [[Great Portland Street]], London, during the winter of 1919<U+2013>20, he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.<ref name= Fisher441>Fisher, p. 441</ref> At the same time, despite the large debts still outstanding from the ''Endurance'' expedition, he began planning a new exploration venture.<ref name= Fisher441/>

===Canadian proposal===
[[Image:Sea ice terrain.jpg|thumb|Dense pack ice in the [[Beaufort Sea]].]]
Shackleton had decided to turn away from the Antarctic, go northwards, and "fill in this great blank now called the [[Beaufort Sea]]".<ref name= Fisher442>Fisher, pp. 442<U+2013>45</ref> This area of the Arctic ocean, to the north of [[Alaska]] and west of the [[Canadian Arctic archipelago]], was largely unexplored; Shackleton believed, on the basis of tidal records, that the sea held large undiscovered land masses that "would be of the greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic value".<ref name= Fisher442/>  He also hoped to reach the northern [[Pole of Inaccessibility#Northern pole of inaccessibility|"pole of inaccessibility"]], the most remote point in the Arctic regions.<ref>Wild, p. 2</ref>  In March 1920, his plans received the general approval of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS) and were supported by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the necessary funding, which he estimated at <U+00A3>50,000 (about <U+00A3>1.6&nbsp;million, 2008 value).<ref name= Fisher442/><ref>{{cite web|title= Measuring Worth|url= http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/|publisher= Institute for the Measurement of Worth|accessdate= 21 November 2008|dateformat= dmy}}</ref> Later that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, [[John Quiller Rowett]],  who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to enable Shackleton to get started. With this money Shackleton was able, in January 1921, to acquire the wooden Norwegian whaler ''Foca I'', and to proceed with the purchase of other equipment and the hiring of a crew.<ref name= Fisher442/>

In May 1921 the Canadian plans were abandoned. The policy of the government of Canada on the funding of expeditions appeared to change, and a series of telegrams between Shackleton and the new Canadian premier [[Arthur Meighen]] resulted in the latter withdrawing support.<ref name= Huntford680>Huntford, pp. 680<U+2013>82</ref> Shackleton's response was not to cancel the expedition but to reorient it. In the middle of May his associate [[Alexander Macklin]], who was in Canada negotiating the purchase of dogs, received a telegram notifying him that the destination was, after all, to be the Antarctic; a varied programme comprising exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern waters had been substituted for the Beaufort Sea venture.<ref name= Fisher442/>

==Antarctic preparation==
===Objectives===
[[Image:Shack-endurance.png|thumb|upright|[[Ernest Shackleton|Sir Ernest Shackleton]], the expedition's leader.]]
Even before his impasse with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort Sea. According to RGS librarian [[Hugh Robert Mill]], as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes&mdash;the Beaufort Sea exploration and "an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the South Atlantic and South Pacific".<ref>Mills, p. 287</ref> By June 1921, it had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000&nbsp;miles (3,200&nbsp;km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for "lost" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands, investigations of possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands, and an ambitious scientific research program.<ref name= Fisher446/> Shackleton biographer Margery Fisher calls the plan "diffuse", and "far too comprehensive for one small body of men to tackle within two years".<ref name= Fisher446>Fisher, pp. 446<U+2013>49</ref> According to biographer [[Roland Huntford]] the expedition had no obvious goal and was "only too clearly a piece of improvisation, a pretext [for Shackleton] to get away".<ref>Huntford, p. 684</ref>
[[Image:Rowett.png|thumb|left|upright|[[John Quiller Rowett]], who financed the expedition.]]
Fisher describes the expedition as representing "the dividing line between what has become known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration and the Mechanical Age".<ref name= Fisher446/> Shackleton called the voyage "pioneering", referring specifically to the aeroplane that was taken (but ultimately not used) on the expedition.<ref name= Fisher446/> In fact this was only one of the technological "firsts" that marked the venture; there were gadgets in profusion. The ship's [[crow's nest]] was electrically heated; there were heated overalls for the lookouts, a wireless set, and a device called an odograph which could trace and chart the ship's route automatically.<ref name= Fisher446/> Photography was to figure prominently, and "a large and expensive outfit of cameras, cinematographical machines and general photographic appliances [was] acquired".<ref>Frank Wild, quoted in Leif Mills, p. 289</ref> Among the oceanographical research equipment was a Lucas deep-sea sounding machine.<ref>Wild, p. 13</ref> 

This ample provision arose from the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of [[seed money]] to an undertaking to cover the costs of the entire expedition.<ref name= Leif287>Mills, pp. 287<U+2013>88</ref> The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as "about <U+00A3>100,000".<ref name= Fisher446/> Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have subscribed to it in full, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt.<ref>Wild (Preface)</ref><ref>Huntford (p. 693) records that Rowett estimated that the expedition had cost him <U+00A3>70,000</ref> According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton."<ref name= WildRGS>{{cite journal|authorlink= Frank Wild|title= The Voyage of the "Quest"|journal= The Geographical Journal|volume= 61|page= 74|date= February 1923}}</ref>  His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition.<ref name= Leif287/> Rowett was, according to Huntford, "a stodgy, prosaic looking" businessman,<ref name= Huntford682>Huntford, p. 682</ref> who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in [[Aberdeen]] known as the [[Rowett Research Institute]] (now part of the [[University of Aberdeen]]). He had also endowed dental research work at the [[Middlesex Hospital]].<ref name= Huntford682/> Rowett did not live long after the return of the expedition; in 1924, aged 50, he took his own life following an apparent downturn in his business fortunes.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Agricultural Association, the Development Fund, and the Origins of the Rowett Research Institute|url= http://www.bahs.org.uk/46n1a4.pdf| format=pdf|publisher= British Agricultural History Society|accessdate= 5 November 2008|dateformat= dmy}} Footnote, p. 60</ref>

In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his expedition vessel ''Quest''.<ref name=Huntford684>Huntford, pp. 684<U+2013>85</ref>  She was a small ship, 125&nbsp;tons according to Huntford, with sail and auxiliary engine power purportedly capable of making eight [[knots]], but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half.<ref name= Fisher460>Fisher, pp. 459<U+2013>61</ref><ref>Eight knots = 9.2 miles per hour, 14.8 kph. 5<U+00BD> knots = 6.3 mph, 10.2 mph</ref> Huntford describes her as [[Stem (ship)|"straight-stemmed"]], with an awkward [[square rig]], and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas.<ref name= Huntford684/> Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204&nbsp;tons, and had a large and spacious deck.<ref name= Fisher460/><ref>The difference in the figures provided by Huntford and Fisher may represent the distinction between [[tonnage]], a measure of volume, and [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], a measure of weight.  </ref>  Although she had some modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins,<ref>Huntford (''The Shackleton Voyages''), p. 259</ref> she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, on the first day out, observed that "in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm".<ref name = Mills287>Mills, pp. 287<U+2013>90</ref> Leif Mills, in his biography of [[Frank Wild]], says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the Arctic [[pack ice]].<ref name= Mills287/> On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call.<ref name= Huntford684/>

===Personnel===
{{details|List of personnel of the Shackleton<U+2013>Rowett Expedition}}
[[The Times|''The Times'']] newspaper had reported that Shackleton planned to take a dozen men to the Arctic, "chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier expeditions".<ref name= Fisher442/> In actuality, ''Quest'' left London for the south with 20&nbsp;men, of whom eight were old ''Endurance'' comrades; another, James Dell, was a veteran from the ''Discovery'', 20&nbsp;years previously.<ref>Fisher, p. 464</ref> Some of the ''Endurance'' hands had not been fully paid from the earlier expedition, but were prepared to join Shackleton again out of personal loyalty.<ref name= Huntford684>Huntford, p. 684</ref><ref>Another Shackleton loyalist, [[Ernest Joyce]], had fallen out with Shackleton over the money he claimed was owed to him, and was not invited to join the expedition. Tyler-Lewis, pp. 256<U+2013>57</ref>
[[Image:FrankWild.png|thumb|150x150px|upright|left|[[Frank Wild]], second-in-command of the expedition.]]
Frank Wild, on his fourth trip with Shackleton, filled the second-in-command post as he had on the ''Endurance '' expedition. [[Frank Worsley]], ''Endurance'''s former captain, became captain of ''Quest''. Other old comrades included the two surgeons, [[Alexander Macklin]] and [[James McIlroy]], the meteorologist [[Leonard Hussey]], the engineer Alfred Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green.<ref name= Huntford684/>  Shackleton had assumed that [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] would sign up, and had assigned him duties "in charge of boats",<ref name= Smith308/> but Crean had retired from the navy to start a family back home in [[County Kerry]], and refused Shackleton's invitation.<ref name= Smith308>Smith, p. 308</ref>

Of the newcomers, [[Roderick Carr]], a New Zealand-born [[Royal Air Force]] pilot, was hired to fly the expedition's aeroplane, an Avro "Antarctic" Baby: an [[Avro Baby]] modified as a seaplane with an 80-[[horse power]] engine.<ref>Riffenbergh, p. 892</ref><ref>Verdon-Roe, p. 258</ref> He had met Shackleton in North Russia, and had recently been serving as Chief of Staff to the [[Lithuania|Lithuanian]] air force.<ref>Carr subsequently had a distinguished Royal Air Force career, rising to the rank of [[Air Marshal]] and becoming Deputy Chief of Staff (Air) to [[SHAEF]] in 1945. Fisher, p. 489</ref> In fact, the aeroplane was not used during the expedition due to some missing parts, and Car therefore assisted with the scientific work.<ref name= Fisher451>Fisher, pp. 451<U+2013>53</ref> The scientific staff included Australian [[biologist]] [[George Hubert Wilkins|Hubert Wilkins]], who had Arctic experience, and the Canadian [[geologist]] Vibert Douglas, who had initially signed for the aborted Beaufort Sea expedition.<ref name= Fisher451/> The  recruits who caught the most public attention were two members of the [[Scout Association|Boy Scouts' movement]], Norman Mooney and [[James Marr]]. As the result of  publicity organised by the [[Daily Mail|''Daily Mail'']] newspaper, these two had been selected to join the expedition out of around 1,700&nbsp;Scouts who had applied to go.<ref>Fisher, p. 454</ref> Mooney, who was from the [[Orkney Islands]], soon dropped out, leaving the ship at [[Madeira]] after suffering chronic seasickness.<ref name= Wild32>Wild, p. 32</ref> Marr, an 18-year-old from [[Aberdeen]], remained with the expedition throughout, winning plaudits from Shackleton and Wild for his application to the tasks at  hand. After being put to work in the ship's coal bunkers, according to Wild, Marr "came out of the trial very well, showing an amount of hardihood and endurance that was remarkable".<ref name= Wild32/>

==Expedition==
===Voyage south===
[[Image:South georgia Islands map-en.svg|thumb|250px|[[South Georgia]], the expedition's first sub-Antarctic port of call. [[Grytviken]] Harbour is indicated on the northern shore.]]
''Quest'' sailed from [[St Katherine's Dock]], London, on 17 September 1921, after inspection by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].<ref>Huntford, p. 683</ref> Large crowds gathered on the banks of the river and on the bridges, to witness the event. Marr wrote in his diary that it was as though "all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell".<ref name= Fisher460/> 

Shackleton's original intention was to sail down to [[Cape Town]], visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, ''Quest'' would head for the [[Enderby Land]] coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline in the direction of [[Coats Land]] in the [[Weddell Sea]]. At the end of the summer season the ship would visit [[South Georgia]] before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work.<ref name= Fisher460/> However, the ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in [[Lisbon]], and further stops in Madeira and the [[Cape Verde Islands]].<ref name= Leif292>Mills, pp. 292<U+2013>93</ref> These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards [[Rio de Janeiro]], where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. ''Quest'' reached Rio on 22 November 1921.<ref name=Leif292/>

The engine overhaul, and the replacement of the damaged topmast,<ref>Wild, p. 44</ref> delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant that it was no longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Instead, Shackleton decided that the ship would sail directly to [[Grytviken]] harbour in South Georgia.<ref name= Fisher466>Fisher, pp. 466<U+2013>67</ref> Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton evidently hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia.<ref name=Fisher466/> He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, "The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know what he will do."<ref name= Fisher471>Fisher, pp. 471<U+2013>73</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 688</ref>

===Death of Shackleton===
On 17 December, the day before ''Quest'' was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell ill. He may have suffered a heart attack;<ref>Huntford, p. 687</ref> Macklin was called, but Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself "better" the next morning.<ref name= Fisher471/><ref>Mills, p. 294</ref>  On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and listless. He also began drinking champagne each morning, "to deaden the pain", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea.<ref name= Fisher471/> A severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress.<ref>Fisher, pp. 473<U+2013>76</ref> By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: "Rest and calm after the storm <U+2013> the year has begun kindly for us", wrote Shackleton in his diary.<ref name= Shackdiary>{{cite web|last = Shackleton|first= Ernest|title= Diary of the ''Quest'' Expedition 1921<U+2013>22|url= http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/shackleton/articles/1537,3,9.html|publisher= [[Scott Polar Research Institute]]|location= Cambridge|accessdate = 3 December 2008|dateformat= dmy}}</ref> On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, and late that morning ''Quest'' anchored at Grytviken.
[[Image:1989 shackleton-grave hg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The grave of Sir Ernest Shackleton]]
After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton returned to the ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary.<ref name= Fisher476>Fisher, pp. 476<U+2013>77</ref><ref>Mills, p. 294</ref> "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay."<ref name= Shackdiary/> Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty.<ref name= Fisher476/> Shortly after 2&nbsp;a.m. on the morning of 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin.  According to Macklin's diary, he found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: "You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?" Macklin replied "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." Immediately afterwards Shackleton "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".<ref>Macklin diary, quoted by Fisher, p. 477</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 690</ref>

The death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as "Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure"<U+2014>in modern terms, [[coronary thrombosis]].<ref name= Fisher478/> Later that morning Wild, now in command, gave the news to the shocked crew, and told them that the expedition would carry on.<ref>Wild, p. 66</ref> The body was brought ashore for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey accompanied the body aboard a steamer bound for [[Montevideo]], but on arrival there he found a message from Lady Shackleton, requesting that the body be returned to South Georgia for burial.<ref name= Fisher478/> Hussey accompanied the body aboard a British steamer, and returned to Grytviken.<ref name= Fisher478>Fisher, pp. 478<U+2013>81</ref> Here, on 5 March, Shackleton was buried in the Norwegian cemetery; ''Quest'' had meantime sailed, so only Hussey of Shackleton's former comrades was present.<ref>Wild, p. 69</ref> A rough cross marked the grave, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.<ref>See Fisher, illustrations pp. 480<U+2013>81</ref>

===Voyage to the ice===
As leader, Wild had first to decide where the expedition should now go. Kerr reported that the furnace problem was manageable, and after supplementing stores and equipment with what was available in South Georgia, Wild decided to proceed in general accordance with Shackleton's original plans.  He would take the ship eastward towards [[Bouvet Island]] and then beyond, before turning south to enter the ice as close as possible to Enderby Land, and begin coastal survey work there. The expedition would also investigate an [[Phantom island|"Appearance of Land"]] in the mouth of the Weddell Sea, reported by [[Sir James Clark Ross]] in 1842, but not seen since. Ultimately, however, progress would depend on weather, ice conditions, and the capabilities of the ship.<ref>Wild, pp. 73<U+2013>75 and 78<U+2013>79</ref>

[[Image:Quest Antarctica.png|thumb|300px|Track of ''Quest''  between 3<U+2013>24 February 1922,  showing attempts to penetrate the [[pack ice]] towards the Antarctic coast<ref>Based on Wild, pp. 98<U+2013>137</ref>]]
''Quest'' left South Georgia on 18 January, heading south-east towards the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. There was a heavy [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its [[gunwales]] below the waves, filling the [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#W|waist]] with water.<ref>Wild, pp. 82<U+2013>87</ref> As they proceeded, Wild wrote that ''Quest'' rolled like a log, was leaking and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him, at the end of January, to change his plan. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to the edge of the [[pack ice]] on 4 February.<ref>Wild, pp. 88<U+2013>91 and p. 98</ref>

"Now the little ''Quest'' can really try her mettle", wrote Wild, as the ship entered the loose pack.<ref name= Wild98>Wild, pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref> He noted that ''Quest'' was the smallest ship ever to attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered on the fate of others. "Shall we escape, or will the ''Quest'' join the ships in Davy Jones's Locker?"<ref name= Wild98/><ref>[[Davy Jones's Locker]] is the traditional seaman's euphemism for the bottom of the sea.</ref> During the days that followed, as they moved southward in falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February they reached the most southerly latitude they would attain, 69<U+00B0>17'S, and their most easterly longitude, 17<U+00B0>9'E, well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice and fearing being frozen in, Wild "beat a hasty and energetic retreat" to the north and west.<ref>Wild, pp. 115<U+2013>21</ref> Wild still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible to break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February he turned the ship south again for another try, but was no more successful than before.<ref>Wild, p. 132</ref> On 24 February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea. The ship would try to visit [[Elephant Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands|South Shetlands]], before returning to South Georgia on the onset of winter.<ref>Wild, p. 136</ref>

[[Image:Elephant Island NOAA.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching [[Elephant Island]] (1962 photograph)]]
For the most part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea proceeded uneventfully. Wild and Worsley were not hitting it off, according to Macklin,<ref>Mills, p. 303</ref> and there was other discontent among the crew which Wild, in his own account, dealt with by the threat of "the most drastic treatment".<ref>Wild, pp. 137<U+2013>39</ref> On 12 March they reached 64<U+00B0>11'S, 46<U+00B0>4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an "Appearance of Land" in 1842, but there was no sign of it, and a depth sounding of over 2,300&nbsp;[[fathoms]] (13,800&nbsp;ft, 4,200&nbsp;m.) indicated no likelihood of land nearby.<ref>Wild, p. 144</ref> Between 15<U+2013>21 March ''Quest'' was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. When the ship broke free, Wild set a course directly for Elephant Island, where he hoped that the coal supply could be supplemented by [[Blubber|blubber]] from the [[elephant seal]]s there.<ref>Mills, p. 304</ref> On 25 March the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old ''Endurance'' expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals.<ref name= Leif305>Mills, p. 305</ref> They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, with a favourable wind, they managed to reach South Georgia on 6 April.<ref name= Leif305/>

===Return===
[[Image:Tristan Map.png|thumb|250px|Map showing [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Inaccessible Island]] and [[Gough Island]], [[South Atlantic]]]]
''Quest'' remained in South Georgia for a month, during which time Shackleton's old comrades erected a memorial cairn to their former leader, on a headland overlooking the entrance to Grytviken harbor.<ref>Fisher, pp. 482<U+2013>83</ref> ''Quest'' finally sailed for South Africa on 8 May. The first port of call, however, was to be [[Tristan da Cunha]], a remote inhabited island to the west and south of Cape Town. Here, on the orders of the [[Chief Scout]], Marr was to present a flag to the local Scout Troop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Shackleton-Rowett Expedition 50th anniversary, Tristan da Cunha |url=http://www.sossi.org/articles/tristan.htm |publisher=Scouts on Stamps Society International |Accessyear=2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |dateformat=dmy}}</ref><ref name= Wild232/>  After a rough crossing of the "[[roaring forties]]", ''Quest'' arrived at Tristan da Cunha on 20 May.<ref name= Leif306/>  

During the five-day stay, with the help of some of the islanders, the expedition made brief landings on the small  [[Inaccessible Island, Tristan da Cunha|Inaccessible Island]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} south-west of Tristan, and visited the even smaller [[Nightingale Island]], collecting specimens.<ref>Wild, pp. 206<U+2013>14</ref> Wild's impressions of the stay at Tristan were not altogether favourable. He noted the appalling squalor and poverty, and said of the population: "They are ignorant, shut off almost completely from the world, horribly limited in outlook."<ref>Wild, p. 207</ref> Despite these reservations, the Scout parade and flag presentation took place before ''Quest'' sailed on to [[Gough Island]], {{convert|200|mi|km}} to the east.<ref name= Wild232>Wild, p. 232</ref> Here members of the expedition took geological and botanical samples.<ref name= Leif306>Mills, pp. 306<U+2013>08</ref> They arrived at Cape Town on 18 June, to be greeted by enthusiastic crowds. The South African Prime Minister, [[Jan Smuts]], gave a official reception for them, and they were honoured at dinners and lunches by local organisations.<ref name= Leif306/>

They were also met by Rowett's agent, with the message that they should return to England.<ref>Fisher, p. 483</ref> Wild wrote: "I should have liked one more season in the Enderby Quadrant...much might be accomplished by making Cape Town our starting point and setting out early in the season."<ref>Wild, p. 287</ref> However, on 19 July they left Cape Town and sailed northwards. Their final visits were to [[St Helena]], [[Ascension Island]] and [[Sao Vicente, Cape Verde|St Vincent]]. On 16 September, one year after departure, they arrived at [[Plymouth|Plymouth Harbour]].<ref>Wild, p. 313</ref>

==Aftermath==
===Assessment===
According to Wild, the expedition ended "quietly", although his biographer Leif Mills writes of enthusiastic crowds in Plymouth Sound.<ref name = Wild312>Wild, pp. 312<U+2013>13</ref><ref>Mills, p. 308</ref> At the end of his account, Wild expressed the hope that the information they had brought back might "prove of value in helping to solve the great natural problems that still beset us".<ref name= Wild312/> These results were summarised in five brief appendices to Wild's book.<ref>Wild, pp. 321<U+2013>49</ref> The summaries reflected the efforts of the scientific staff to collect data and specimens at each port of call,<ref>Mills, p. 307</ref> and the geological and survey work carried out by Carr and Douglas on South Georgia, before the southern voyage.<ref>Wild, p. 80</ref> Eventually a few scientific papers and articles were developed from this material,<ref>Fisher, pp. 516<U+2013>17</ref> but it was, in Leif Mills's words, "little enough to show for a year's work".<ref>Mills, p. 307</ref>

The lack of a clear, defined expedition objective<ref>Huntford, p. 464</ref><ref name= Leif330>Mills, p. 330</ref> was aggravated by the failure to call at Cape Town on the way south, with the result that important equipment was not picked up. On South Georgia, Wild found little that could make up for this loss&mdash;there were no dogs on the island, so no sledging work could be carried out, which eliminated Wild's preferred choice of a revised expedition goal, an exploration of [[Graham Land]] on the [[Antarctic peninsula]].<ref>Wild, pp. 74<U+2013>75</ref> The death of Shackleton before the beginning of serious work was a heavy blow, and questions were raised about the adequacy of Wild as his replacement. Some reports have Wild drinking heavily&mdash;"practically an alcoholic", according to Shackleton's biographer, [[Roland Huntford]].<ref>Huntford, p. 693</ref><ref>Mills, p. 297</ref> Mills suggests, however, that even if Shackleton had lived to complete the expedition, it is arguable whether, under the circumstances, it could have achieved more than it did under Wild's command.<ref name= Leif330/> On the voyage south, colleagues had been struck by the changes in Shackleton&mdash;his listlessness, docility and vacillation.<ref>Huntford, pp. 687<U+2013>88</ref>

As for technical innovation, the failure of the aeroplane to fly was another disappointment. Shackleton's hopes had been high that he could pioneer the use of this form of transport in Antarctic waters, and he had discussed this issue with the British [[Air Ministry]].<ref>Fisher, pp. 447<U+2013>48</ref> According to Fisher's account, essential aeroplane parts had been sent on to Cape Town, but remained uncollected.<ref>Fisher, p. 452</ref> The long-range, 220-volt wireless equipment did not work properly and was abandoned early on. The smaller, 110-volt equipment worked only within a range of {{convert|250|mi|km|sigfig=2}}.<ref name= WildRGS/> During the Tristan visit, Wild attempted to install a new wireless apparatus with the help of a local missionary, but this was also unsuccessful.<ref>Wild, p. 214</ref>

===End of the Heroic Age===
An Antarctic hiatus followed the return of ''Quest'', there being no significant expeditions to the region for seven years.<ref>{{cite web|title= An Antarctic Time Line 1519<U+2013>1959|url=http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm|publisher= www.southpole.com|accessdate= 30 November 2008|dateformat=dmy}}</ref> The expeditions that then followed were of a different character from their predecessors, belonging to the "mechanical age" that succeeded the Heroic Age.<ref>Fisher, p. 449</ref> 

At the end of his narrative of the ''Quest'' expedition, Wild wrote of the Antarctic: "I think that my work there is done"; he never returned, closing a career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the Heroic Age.<ref name=Wild313>Wild, p. 313</ref><ref>Wild was a member of the [[Discovery Expedition]], 1901<U+2013>04; the [[Nimrod Expedition]], 1907<U+2013>09; the [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]] 1911<U+2013>13; the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914<U+2013>17, and the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition.</ref> None of the expedition members who were veterans from the ''Endurance'' returned to the Antarctic, although Worsley made one voyage to the Arctic in 1925.<ref name =Fisher494>Fisher, p. 494</ref> Of the other crew and staff of ''Quest'', the Australian naturalist Hubert Wilkins became a pioneer aviator in both the Arctic and Antarctic, in 1928 flying from [[Point Barrow]], Alaska to [[Spitsbergen]].  He also made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1930s, in collaboration with the American adventurer [[Lincoln Ellsworth]], to fly to the South Pole.<ref name= Fisher494/>  James Marr, the Boy Scout, also became an Antarctic regular after qualifying as a marine biologist, joining several Australian expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s.<ref>Fisher, p. 492</ref> Roderick Carr, the frustrated pilot, became an [[Air Marshal]] in the Royal Air Force.<ref>Fisher, p. 489</ref>
