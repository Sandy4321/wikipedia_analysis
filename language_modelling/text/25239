'''Judy Garland''' (born '''Frances Ethel Gumm'''; June 10, 1922 <U+2013> June 22, 1969) was an American actress and singer. Through a career that spanned 45 of her 47 years, Garland attained international stardom as an actress in musical and dramatic roles, as a recording artist and on the concert stage. Respected for her versatility, she received a Juvenile [[Academy Award]], won a [[Golden Globe]] Award, received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for her work in films, as well as [[Grammy Award]]s and a [[Tony Award]]. She had a [[contralto]] singing range.<ref name="hippodrome">{{cite web |url=http://users.deltacomm.com/rainbowz/con070951.html |title=Judy Garland at the Hippodrome |accessdate=2008-09-05 |publisher=Judy Garland - The Live Performances!}}</ref>

After appearing in [[vaudeville]] with her sisters, Garland was signed to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] as a teenager. There she made more than two dozen films, including nine with [[Mickey Rooney]], and the film with which she would be most identified, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939). After 15 years, Garland was released from the studio but gained renewed success through record-breaking concert appearances, including a critically acclaimed [[Carnegie Hall]] concert, a well-regarded but short-lived television series and a return to film acting beginning with ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1954).

Despite her professional triumphs, Garland battled personal problems throughout her life. Insecure about her appearance, her feelings were compounded by film executives who told her she was unattractive and overweight. Plied with drugs to control her weight and increase her productivity, Garland endured a decades-long struggle with [[addiction]]. Garland was plagued by financial instability, often owing hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes, and her first four of five marriages ended in divorce.  She attempted [[suicide]] on a number of occasions. Garland died of an accidental [[drug overdose]] at the age of forty-seven, leaving children [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Lorna Luft]] and Joey Luft.

In 1997, Garland was posthumously awarded a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and several of her recordings have been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] placed her among the ten [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars|greatest female stars]] in the history of American cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/stars.aspx|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|date=[[1999-06-16]]|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

==Childhood and early life==
Born in [[Grand Rapids, Minnesota|Grand Rapids]], [[Minnesota]], Garland was the youngest child of former [[vaudevillians]] Frank Gumm and Ethel Marion Milne. Her ancestry on both sides of the family can be traced back to the early [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial days of the United States]]. Her father was descended from the Marable family of [[Virginia]] and her mother from Patrick Fitzpatrick, who arrived in America from Smithtown, [[County Meath]], Ireland, in the 1770s.<ref>{{cite web

Named after both her parents and baptized at a local [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church, "Baby" (as Frances was affectionately called) shared the family's flair for song and dance. "Baby" Gumm's first appearance came at the age of two-and-a-half, when she joined her two older sisters, Mary Jane ("Suzy") and Dorothy Virginia ("Jimmie") on stage for a chorus of "[[Jingle Bells]]" in a Christmas show at her father's movie theater.<ref>Shipman p. 12</ref>

The Gumm girls performed at their father's theater, accompanied by their mother on piano, for the next few years. In June 1926, following rumors that Frank had made sexual advances toward male ushers at his theater, the family relocated to [[Lancaster, California]].<ref>Clarke, Gerald. ''Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland''. Random House. New York, 2001. p. 23</ref> Frank purchased and operated another theater there and Ethel, acting as their manager, began working to get her daughters into pictures.

==The Gumm Sisters==
In 1928, The Gumm Sisters enrolled in a dance school run by Ethel Meglin, proprietress of the [[Meglin Kiddies]] dance troupe. The sisters appeared with the troupe at its annual Christmas show.<ref>Clarke . 29<U+2013>30</ref> It was through the Meglin Kiddies that Garland and her sisters would make their film debut, in a 1929 short subject called ''The Big Revue''. This was followed by appearances in two [[Vitaphone]] shorts the following year, ''A Holiday in Storyland'' (featuring Garland's first on-screen solo) and ''The Wedding of Jack and Jill''. They next appeared together in ''Bubbles''. The final on-screen appearance of The Gumm Sisters came in 1935, in another short entitled ''La Fiesta de Santa Barbara''.<ref>Finch p. 43&ndash;7, 76</ref>

In 1934, the sisters, who had been touring the vaudeville circuit as "The Gumm Sisters" for many years, performed in [[Chicago]] at the Oriental Theater with [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]]. He encouraged the group to choose a more appealing name after the name "Gumm" was met with laughter from the audience. "The Garland Sisters" was chosen, and Frances changed her name to "Judy" soon after, inspired by a popular [[Hoagy Carmichael]] song.<ref>Edwards p. 27</ref>

Several stories persist regarding the origin of the name "Garland." One is that it was originated by Jessel after [[Carole Lombard]]'s character Lily Garland in the film ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'' which was then playing at the Oriental; another is that the trio chose the surname after drama critic Robert Garland.<ref>{{cite episode

==Signed at MGM==
In 1935 Garland was signed to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, supposedly without a [[screen test]], although she had made a test for the studio several months earlier. The studio did not know what to do with Garland, as at age thirteen she was older than the traditional child star but too young for adult roles. Garland's physical appearance created a dilemma for MGM. At only {{convert|4|ft|11.5|in|cm}}, Garland's "cute" or "[[girl-next-door]]" looks did not exemplify the more glamorous persona required by leading ladies of the time. She was self-conscious and anxious about her appearance. "Judy went to school at Metro with [[Ava Gardner]], [[Lana Turner]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], real beauties," said [[Charles Walters]], who directed Garland in a number of films. "Judy was the big money-maker at the time, a big success, but she was the [[ugly duckling]]...I think it had a very damaging effect on her emotionally for a long time. I think it lasted forever, really."<ref>{{cite episode

She was made to wear portable [[Crown (dentistry)|caps]] on her teeth and rubberized disks to reshape her nose.<ref>Frank p. 73</ref> She performed at various studio functions and was eventually cast opposite [[Deanna Durbin]] in the musical short ''[[Every Sunday]]''. The film served as an extended screen test for the pair as studio executives were wondering at the wisdom of having two girl singers on the roster.<ref>Clarke p. 73</ref> Mayer finally decided to keep both girls, but by that time Durbin's option had lapsed and she was signed by [[Universal Studios]].

On November 16, 1935, in the midst of preparing for a radio performance on the ''[[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] Chateau Hour,'' Garland learned that her father&mdash;who had been hospitalized with [[spinal meningitis]]&mdash;had taken a turn for the worse. Frank Gumm died the following morning, on November 17. Garland's song for the ''Shell Chateau Hour'' was her first professional rendition of "Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart", a song which would become a standard in many of her concerts.<ref>Clarke p. 58</ref>

[[Image:Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Garland with [[Mickey Rooney]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938)]]
Garland next came to the attention of studio executives by singing a special arrangement of "[[You Made Me Love You]]" to [[Clark Gable]] at a birthday party held by the studio for the actor; her rendition was so well regarded that Garland performed the song in their all-star extravaganza ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (1937), in which she sang the song to a photograph of Gable.<ref>Edwards p. 47</ref>

MGM hit on a winning formula when it paired Garland with Mickey Rooney in a string of "backyard musicals." The duo first appeared together in the 1937 [[B movie]] ''[[Thoroughbreds Don't Cry]]''. They became a sensation, and teamed up again in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]''. Garland would eventually star with Rooney in nine films.

To keep up with the frantic pace of making one film after another, Garland, Rooney, and other young performers were constantly given [[amphetamines]], as well as [[barbiturates]] to take before bed.<ref>{{cite episode

She later resented the hectic schedule and felt that her youth had been stolen from her by MGM. Despite successful film and recording careers, several awards, critical praise, and her ability to fill concert halls worldwide, Garland was plagued throughout her life with self-doubt and required constant reassurance that she was talented and attractive.<ref>Clarke p. 135&ndash;6</ref> [[Oscar Levant]] later remarked that "at parties, Judy could sing all night, endlessly... but when it came time to appear on a movie set, she just wouldn't show up."<ref>{{cite book

==''The Wizard of Oz''==
[[Image:Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz trailer 2.jpg|thumb|225px|Garland as [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939)]]
Garland soon landed the lead role of [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939) at the age of sixteen, in which she introduced the song with which she would forever be identified, "[[Over the Rainbow]]". Although producers [[Arthur Freed]] and [[Mervyn LeRoy]] had wanted Garland from the start, studio chief Mayer tried first to borrow [[Shirley Temple]] from [[20th Century Fox]]. Temple's services were denied and Garland was cast.<ref>Juneau p. 37</ref> Garland was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming. Her breasts were bound with tape and she was made to wear a special [[corset]] to flatten out her curves and make her appear younger; her blue [[gingham]] dress (her only costume) was also chosen for its blurring effect on her figure.<ref>Finch p. 134&ndash;5</ref>

Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938,<ref>Clarke p. 95</ref> and was completed on March 16, 1939,<ref>Clarke p. 100</ref> with a final cost of over [[USD|$]]2,000,000.<ref>Edwards p. 61</ref> From the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of ''[[Babes in Arms (1939 film)|Babes in Arms]]''. Garland and Mickey Rooney were sent on a cross-country promotional tour, culminating in the August 17 [[New York City]] [[premiere]] at the Capitol Theatre, which included a five-show-a-week appearance schedule for the two stars.<ref>Clarke p. 102&ndash;3</ref>

''The Wizard of Oz'' was a tremendous critical success, although its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated $4,000,000, coupled with the lower revenue generated by children's tickets, meant that the film did not make a profit until it was re-released in the 1940s.<ref>Clarke p. 104</ref> At the [[13th Academy Awards|1940 Academy Awards]] ceremony, Garland received an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for her performances in 1939, including ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms''.<ref>Clarke p. 105</ref> Following this recognition, Garland became one of MGM's most bankable stars.

==Adult stardom==
[[Image:Judy Garland in Meet Me in St Louis trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Garland performing "The Trolley Song" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944)]]
In 1940, she starred in three films: ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]'', ''[[Strike Up the Band]]'', and ''[[Little Nellie Kelly]]''. In the latter film, Garland played her first adult role, a dual role of both mother and daughter. ''Little Nellie Kelly'' was purchased from [[George M. Cohan]] as a vehicle for Garland to assess both her audience appeal and her physical appearance. The role was a challenge for her, requiring the use of an accent, her first adult kiss and the only death scene of her career.<ref>Juneau p. 55&ndash;6</ref> The success of these three films, and a further three films in 1941, secured her position at MGM as a major property.

During this time Garland experienced her first serious adult romances. The first was with the band leader [[Artie Shaw]]. Garland was deeply devoted to Shaw and was devastated in early 1940 when Shaw eloped with Lana Turner.<ref>Frank p. 148&ndash;9</ref> Garland began a relationship with musician [[David Rose]], and on her eighteenth birthday, Rose gave her an engagement ring. The studio intervened because Rose was still married at the time to the actress and singer [[Martha Raye]]. The couple agreed to wait a year to allow for Rose's divorce from Raye to become final, and were wed on July 27, 1941.<ref>Clarke p. 155</ref> She was noticeably thinner in her next film, ''[[For Me and My Gal (film)|For Me and My Gal]]'', alongside [[Gene Kelly]] in his first screen appearance. Garland was top billed over the credits for the first time and effectively made the transition from teenage star to adult actress.

At the age of twenty-one, she was given the "glamour treatment" in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'', in which she was dressed in "grown-up" gowns. Her lightened hair was also pulled up in a stylish fashion. However, no matter how glamorous or beautiful she appeared on screen or in photographs, she was never confident in her appearance and never escaped the "girl next door" image that had been created for her.<ref>Frank p 175</ref> Adding to her insecurity was the dissolution of her marriage to David Rose. Garland, who had aborted her pregnancy by Rose in 1942, agreed to a trial separation in January 1943 and they divorced in 1944.<ref>Clarke p. 211</ref>

One of Garland's most successful films for MGM was ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), in which she introduced three standards: "[[The Trolley Song]]", "[[The Boy Next Door (song)|The Boy Next Door]]", and "[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]." [[Vincente Minnelli]] was assigned to direct this movie, and he requested that make-up artist Dorothy Ponedel be assigned to Garland for the picture. Ponedel refined Garland's appearance in several ways, including extending and reshaping her eyebrows, changing her hairline, modifying her lip line and removing her nose discs. Garland appreciated the results so much that Ponedel was written into her contract for all her remaining pictures at MGM.<ref>{{cite book

''[[The Clock (film)|The Clock]]'' (1945) was her first straight dramatic film, opposite [[Robert Hudson Walker|Robert Walker]]. Though the film was critically praised and earned a profit, most movie fans expected her to sing. It would be many years before she acted again in a non-singing dramatic role.

Garland's other famous films of the 1940s include ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (1946), in which she introduced the [[Academy Award]]-winning song "[[On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe]]", and ''[[The Pirate]]'' (1948).

==Leaving MGM==
[[Image:Judy Garland in Summer Stock trailer 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Garland performing "Get Happy" in ''Summer Stock'' (1950)]]
During filming for ''The Pirate'' in April 1947, Garland suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and was placed in a private [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]].<ref>Edwards p. 108</ref> She was able to complete filming, but in July of that year she made her first [[suicide attempt]], making minor cuts to her wrist with a broken glass.<ref>Frank p. 231</ref> Following her work on ''The Pirate'', Garland completed three more films for MGM: ''[[Easter Parade (1948 film)|Easter Parade]]'', ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'', and her final film with MGM, ''[[Summer Stock]]''.

Garland was unable to complete a series of films. During the filming of ''[[The Barkleys of Broadway]]'', Garland was taking [[Medical prescription|prescription]] sleeping medication along with illicitly obtained pills containing [[morphine]]. These, in combination with [[migraine]] headaches, led Garland to miss several shooting days in a row. After being advised by Garland's doctor that she would only be able to work in four- to five-day increments with extended rest periods between, [[MGM]] executive Arthur Freed made the decision to suspend Garland on July 18, 1948. She was replaced by [[Ginger Rogers]].<ref>Shipman p. 225</ref> Garland was cast in the film adaptation of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' in the title role of [[Annie Oakley]]. She was nervous at the prospect of taking on a role strongly identified with [[Ethel Merman]], anxious about appearing in an unglamourous role after breaking from juvenile parts for several years, and disturbed by her treatment at the hands of director [[Busby Berkeley]]. She began arriving late to the set and sometimes failed to appear. She was suspended from the picture on May 10, 1949, and was replaced by [[Betty Hutton]].<ref>Clarke p. 255</ref> Garland was next cast in the film ''[[Royal Wedding]]'' when [[June Allyson]] became pregnant in 1950. She again failed to report to the set on multiple occasions, and the studio suspended her contract on June 17, 1950, replacing her with [[Jane Powell]].<ref>Frank p. 271</ref> Reputable biographies following Garland's death would state that after this latest dismissal, she slightly grazed her neck with a broken water glass, requiring only a [[Band-Aid]], but at the time, the public was informed that a despondent Garland had slashed her throat.<ref name = Shana>{{cite news

==''A Star Is Born''==
In 1954, Garland filmed a musical remake of ''A Star Is Born'' for [[Warner Bros.]] Luft and Garland, through their production company Transcona, produced the film while Warner Bros. supplied the funds, production facilities and crew.<ref>Clarke p. 308</ref> Directed by [[George Cukor]] and co-starring [[James Mason]], it was a large undertaking to which Garland initially fully dedicated herself. As shooting progressed, however, she began making the same pleas of illness which she had so often made during her final films at MGM. Production delays led to cost overruns and angry confrontations with Warner Bros. head [[Jack Warner]]. Principal photography wrapped on March 17, 1954. At Luft's suggestion, the "Born in a Trunk" medley was filmed as a showcase for Garland and inserted over director Cukor's objections, who feared the additional length would lead to cuts in other areas. The "Born in a Trunk" sequence was completed on July 29.<ref>Clarke p. 319</ref>

Upon its September 29 world premiere, the film was met with tremendous critical and popular acclaim. Before release it was edited at the instruction of Jack Warner; theater operators, concerned that they were losing money by being able to run the film for three or four shows per day instead of five or six, pressured the studio to make additional reductions. About 30 minutes of footage was cut, sparking outrage amongst critics and filmgoers. ''A Star is Born'' ended up losing money and the secure financial position Garland had expected from the profits did not materialize.<ref>Clarke p. 325</ref> Transcona made no more films with Warner.<ref>Juneau p. 126</ref>

[[Image:Judy Garland in Judgement at Nuremberg trailer.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Garland in ''Judgement at Nuremberg'' (1961)]]
Garland was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and, in the run-up to the [[27th Academy Awards]], was believed to be the likely winner by both the public and critics. She could not attend the ceremony because she had just given birth to her son, Joseph Luft, so a television crew was in Garland's hospital room with cameras and wires to televise Garland's acceptance speech. The Oscar was won by [[Grace Kelly]] for ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' (1954). The camera crew was packing up before Kelly could even reach the stage. [[Groucho Marx]] sent Garland a telegram after the awards declaring her loss "the biggest robbery since [[Great Brink's Robbery|Brinks]]."<ref>Clarke p. 326</ref> Garland won the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in a Musical]] for the role.<ref name = Globes>{{cite web

Garland's films after ''A Star Is Born'' included ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) (for which she was Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated for Best Supporting Actress), the animated feature ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'' (1962), and ''[[A Child Is Waiting]]'' (1963) with [[Burt Lancaster]]. Her final film, ''[[I Could Go On Singing]]'' (1963), co-starring [[Dirk Bogarde]], mirrored her own life with its story of a world famous singing star. Garland<U+2019>s last screen performance of a song was the prophetic ''I Could Go on Singing'' at the end of the film.

==Television, concerts and Carnegie Hall==
Beginning in 1955, Garland appeared in a number of television specials. The first, the 1955 debut episode of ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'', was the first full-scale color broadcast ever on [[CBS]] and was a ratings triumph, scoring a 34.8 [[Nielsen Ratings|Nielsen rating]]. Garland signed a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only one additional special, a live concert edition of ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', was broadcast in 1956 before the relationship between the Lufts and CBS broke down in a dispute over the planned format of upcoming specials.<ref>Sanders p. 24</ref>
In 1956, Garland performed four weeks at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|New Frontier Hotel]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] for a salary of $55,000 per week, making her the highest-paid entertainer to work in Las Vegas to date. Despite a brief bout of [[laryngitis]], her performances there were so successful that her run was extended an extra week.<ref>Frank p. 420&ndash;1</ref> Later that year she returned to the Palace Theatre, site of her two-a-day triumph. She opened in September, once again to rave reviews and popular acclaim.<ref>{{cite news

"The pressure was off me for the first time in my life."<ref name = Shana /> However, Garland successfully recovered over the next several months and, in August of that year, returned to the stage of the Palladium. She felt so warmly embraced by the British that she announced her intentions to move permanently to England.<ref>Clarke p. 349</ref>

In 1961, Garland and CBS settled their contract disputes with the help of her new agent, [[Freddie Fields]], and negotiated a new round of specials. The first, entitled ''The Judy Garland Show'', aired in 1962 and featured guests [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]].<ref>Sanders p. 29</ref> Following this success, CBS made a $24 million offer to Garland for a weekly television series of her own, also to be called ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', which was deemed at the time in the press to be "the biggest talent deal in TV history."

==Final years==
With the demise of her television series, Garland returned to the stage. Most notably, she performed at the [[London Palladium]] with her then 18-year-old daughter [[Liza Minnelli]] in November 1964. The concert, which was also filmed for British television network [[ITV]], was one of Garland's final appearances at the venue. She made guest appearances on the ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' and ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', an episode of which she guest-hosted.<ref>DiOrio p. 202</ref>

A 1964 tour of Australia was largely disastrous. Garland's first concert in [[Sydney]], held in [[Sydney Stadium]] because no concert hall could accommodate the crowds who wanted to see her, went well and received positive reviews. Her second performance, in [[Melbourne]], started an hour late. The crowd of 70,000, angered by her tardiness <U+2014> and believing her to be drunk <U+2014> booed and heckled Garland. The performer fled the stage after just 45 minutes.<ref>Edwards p. 213</ref> She later characterized the Melbourne crowd as "brutish".<ref name = Plot /> A second concert in Sydney was uneventful but the Melbourne appearance garnered her significant bad press.<ref>{{cite news

They announced that their marriage had taken place aboard a freighter off the coast of [[Hong Kong]], however, Garland was not legally divorced from Luft at the time the ceremony was performed.<ref>Edwards p. 214</ref> Her divorce from Luft became final on May 19, 1965,<ref name = Divorce /> but Herron and Garland did not legally marry until November 14.<ref>Frank p. 556</ref>

In February 1967, Garland was cast as "Helen Lawson" in ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. The character of "Neely O'Hara" in the [[Valley of the Dolls|book]] by [[Jacqueline Susann]] was rumored to have been based on Garland. The role of O'Hara in the film was played by [[Patty Duke]]. During the filming, Garland missed rehearsals and was fired in April. She was replaced by [[Susan Hayward]].<ref>Seaman p. 292&ndash;3, 343</ref>

Returning to the stage, Garland made her last appearances at New York's Palace Theatre in July, a 16-show tour, performing with her children Lorna and Joey Luft. Garland wore a sequined pantsuit on stage for this tour, which was part of the original wardrobe for her character in ''Valley of the Dolls.''<ref>Shipman p. 494</ref>

By early 1969, Garland's health had deteriorated.

On June 22, 1969, Garland was found dead by Deans in the bathroom of their rented [[Chelsea, London]] house. The coroner, Gavin Thursdon, stated at the [[inquest]] that the cause of death was "an incautious [[overdose|self-overdosage]]" of [[barbiturate]]s; her blood contained the equivalent of ten {{convert|1.5|gr|mg|adj=on|lk=in}} [[Seconal]] capsules.<ref>Clarke p. 422</ref> Thursdon stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that there was no evidence to suggest she had committed suicide. Garland's autopsy showed that there was no inflammation of her stomach lining and no drug residue in her stomach, which indicated that the drug had been ingested over a long period of time, rather than in one dose.
