'''Gunnar Alexander Huseby''' (4 November 1923 <U+2013> 28 May 1995) was an [[Iceland]]ic [[track and field]] athlete who competed in the [[shot put]] and [[discus throw]] events. He won consecutive [[gold medal]]s at the [[European Athletics Championships]] in 1946 and 1950, becoming Iceland's first European champion in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]]. This placed him among the country's first top international sportsmen, following its independence in 1944. He remains the only Icelandic athlete to win two European athletics title.<ref name=EC/>

He won eighteen Icelandic national title in total: ten in shot put, six in discus throw and two in [[hammer throw]]. His personal best marks of {{T&Fcalc|16.74}} for the shot put and {{T&Fcalc|50.13}} for the discus were [[Icelandic records in athletics|Icelandic records]].

Despite his national success, he also caused controversy in Iceland due to his alcoholism and a physical assault, for which he served a jail sentence. As a result, he was banned from competition for a period by the national governing body.

Huseby was a large distance ahead of runner-up [[Angiolo Profeti]], who managed a little over fifteen metres.<ref name=EC/>

[[Torfi Bryngeirsson]] won the men's [[long jump]] at the same tournament, making this Iceland's best ever European performance in the sport.

===Later career===
He developed [[alcoholism]] during this period and his approach to training and competition earned him a warning from ''[[Frj<U+00E1>ls<U+00ED><U+00FE>r<U+00F3>ttasamband <U+00CD>slands]]'' (the national body for athletics) and an order that further bad conduct would warrant an international ban.<ref>[http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1087571 Keppir Gunnar <U+00ED> Austur-Berl<U+00ED>n me<U+00F0> a<U+00F0>v<U+00F6>runarbr<U+00E9>f <U+00ED> vasanum?] {{is icon}}.

Upon his release, he set an Icelandic indoor record, but the governing body had disagreements with him returning to the national championships <U+2013> a fact which attracted criticism in the press, given Huseby's standing as one of the nation's top sportsmen.<ref>[http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1095684 Var Gunnari Huseby neita<U+00F0> um a<U+00F0> keppa til a<U+00F0> hefnast <U+00E1> KR?] {{is icon}}.
