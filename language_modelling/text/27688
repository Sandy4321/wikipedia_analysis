'''Anthony Longford Mann''' (born 8 November 1945, [[Middle Swan, Western Australia]]) is a former [[Australia]]n [[cricket]]er who played in 4 [[Test cricket|Tests]] from 1977 to 1978.

He was only the second man in history to score a [[Century (cricket)|century]] in a Test match after being sent in as [[nightwatchman (cricket)|nightwatchman]].

==Career==
A leg break bowler with a sharp googly, Mann was almost selected for 1969-70 Australian Second XI Tour of New Zealand when the Test players were in India and South Africa. A useful batsman, he made the Test side during the first season of the [[World Series Cricket|Packer schism]].

He was selected to play against the touring Indian side, being picked over [[Jim Higgs]] due in part because of his better batting. Mann took 3-12 in the first innings of the first test and also making useful scores of 19 and 26 in a closely fought match. He was less successful in the second innings as a bowler, taking 0-52.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63195.html 1st test Australia vs India 1977-78] accessed 24 November 2012</ref>

In the second test he found the going harder against the Indian batsmen, taking 0-63 and 0-49. However he achieved cricket immortality in the second innings, when Australia was chasing 339 to win the game. Mann came to the wicket as nightwatchman when Australia was 1-13 and did not leave until they were 2-172 by which time Mann had scored 105 runs, helping lay the platform for an Australian victory.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63196.html 2nd test Australia vs India 1977-78] accessed 24 November 2012</ref>

He was used sparing as a bowler in the third test<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63197.html 3rd test Australia vs India 1977-78] accessed 24 November 2012</ref> and had a forgettable fourth test, being dismissed for a pair and taking 0-101 with the ball.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63198.html 4th test Australia vs India 1977-78] accessed 24 November 2012</ref> He was dropped in favour of fellow West Australian [[Bruce Yardley]] for the fifth test and never played for Australia again.

His father was [[Jack Mann (winemaker)|Jack Mann]], a pioneer of the wine industry in Western Australia.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/tony-mann-the-first-nightwatchman-century-maker/2006/04/21/1145344277465.html?page=2 The Age - Tony Mann: the first nightwatchman century maker]</ref>
