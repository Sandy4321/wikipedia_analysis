'''Ian Lancaster Fleming''' (28 May 1908&nbsp;<U+2013> 12 August 1964) was a British author, journalist and [[British Naval Intelligence|Naval Intelligence Officer]]. Fleming is best known for creating the fictional spy [[James Bond]] and the series of [[James Bond novels|twelve novels and nine short stories]] about the character. Fleming was from a wealthy family, connected to the merchant bank [[Robert Fleming & Co.]] and his father was [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 1910 until his death on the [[Western Front]] in 1917. Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst]] and the universities of [[Munich University|Munich]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], Fleming moved through a number of jobs before he started writing.

The Bond books are amongst [[List of best-selling books#At least 100&nbsp;million copies|the biggest-selling series of fictional books]] of all-time, having sold over 100&nbsp;million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' and two works of non-fiction. Whilst working in British Naval Intelligence during the Second World War, Fleming was the involved in the planning stages of [[Operation Mincemeat]] and [[Operation Goldeneye]], the former of which was successfully carried out. Fleming was also involved in the planning and overseeing of two active service units, [[30 Assault Unit]] and [[T-Force]].

His experiences of the people he met during his wartime service provided much of the background and detail of the Bond novels and his career as a journalist added colour and depth to the stories. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of "The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945".

Fleming was married to Anne Charteris, who had been divorced from the [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|second Viscount Rothermere]] because of her relationship with Fleming; the couple had one son<U+2014>Caspar<U+2014>although they also both had affairs during their marriage. Fleming was a heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoker]] and heavy [[alcoholic beverage|drinker]] and suffered from [[heart disease]]; he died in the early morning of 12 August 1964 from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Two Bond books written by Fleming were published after his death and a further five continuation authors have also produced novels. Fleming's creation has also appeared in film twenty-four times with seven actors playing the role of Bond.

==Education and early career==
In 1914 Fleming was sent to [[Durnford School]], a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] on the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in Dorset.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} The school was near to the estate of the Bond family, who could trace their ancestry back to an Elizabethan spy called John Bond and whose motto was ''Non Sufficit Orbis''<U+2014>The World Is Not Enough.<ref>{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|title=Ian Fleming 'used 16th century spy as inspiration for James Bond'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3285886/Ian-Fleming-used-16th-century-spy-as-inspiration-for-James-Bond.html|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 October 2008}}</ref> Fleming did not enjoy his time at Durnford; his life included unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} It was during his stay at Durnford that Fleming received the news of his father's death.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=44}}

[[File: Eton College quadrangle.jpg |thumb|right|175px|[[Eton College]]: Fleming's ''alma mater'' from 1921 to 1927.]]
From 1921 Fleming followed his brother Peter to [[Eton College]]. Although not one of the academic stars of the school, he excelled at athletics and was [[Victor Ludorum]] for two years running, in 1925 and 1926, only the second person to accomplish this.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=33}} Fleming also became involved in editing a magazine, ''The Wyvern''.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> Fleming's lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and the fact he had a mistress.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove Fleming from Eton a term early for a [[Cram school|crammer]] course to gain entry to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Royal Military Academy]] at Sandhurst.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} Fleming spent less than a year at Sandhurst, leaving in 1927, without gaining a commission after he picked up a case of [[gonorrhea]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=33}}

His mother sent him to a small private school, the Tennerhof, in the town of [[Kitzb<U+00FC>hel]], Austria, run by the [[Adlerian]] disciple Ernan Forbes Dennis, a former British spy, and his American wife, the novelist [[Phyllis Bottome]].{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=87}} His language skills developed well and from the Tennerhof he studied briefly at [[Munich University]] and the [[University of Geneva]].<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> Whilst in Geneva Fleming became engaged to a French-Swiss woman Monique Panchaud de Bottomes in 1931.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=17}} Fleming's mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=34}} He applied for entry to the [[Foreign Office]], but failed the examinations and his mother intervened in his affairs to lobby Sir Roderick Jones, head of [[Reuters]] News Agency, and in October 1931 he was eventually given a position as a [[sub-editor]] and journalist for the Reuters news service.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow covering the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[show trial]] of six engineers from the British company [[Metropolitan-Vickers]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=46}} Whilst there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising for not being able to attend.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=39}}

Fleming bowed to family pressure in October 1933 and moved into the banking world with a position at Cull & Co.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=46}}  He was not a good banker and, in October 1935, became a [[stockbroker]] with Rowe and Pitman, headquartered on [[Bishopsgate]], London,{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=39}} a position in which he also struggled to become a success.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=72}}

==World War II==
On 24 May 1939 Fleming had lunch with [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Henry Godfrey|John Godfrey]], [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]] of the [[Royal Navy]], at the Grill of the [[Carlton Hotel, London|Carlton Hotel]] on [[Haymarket (London)|Haymarket]] where he was recruited to become Godfrey's personal assistant. Fleming joined the organisation full time in August 1939,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=99}} with the codename "17F",{{sfn|Gant|1966|p=45}} working out of Room 39 at [[Admiralty#The Admiralty|The Admiralty]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=101}} His biographer, [[Andrew Lycett]], notes that Fleming had "no obvious qualifications" for the appointment.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in July 1939,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=99}} initially as [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=101}} but promoted to [[Commander]] by September 1939.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=103}}

Fleming proved to be an excellent PA for Godfrey, with a talent for administration.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> As Godfrey was a prickly character who made a number of enemies within government circles, he used Fleming as a liaison with other sections of the government wartime administration, such as the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], the [[Political Warfare Executive]], the [[Special Operations Executive]], the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s staff.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=28}}

On 29 September 1939<U+2014>only 29 days after the start of [[World War II]]<U+2014>Godfrey published a memorandum largely written by Fleming: [[Trout memo|The trout memo]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=6}} The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the [[Axis powers]], in order to lure [[U-boats]] and German surface ships towards minefields.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=29}} Number 28 on the list was an idea to use a corpse, carrying misleading papers, which the enemy could find: this suggestion formed the basis of [[Operation Mincemeat]], the successful 1943 [[disinformation|deception]] plan to cover the [[operation Husky|intended invasion of Italy]] from [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}}

{{Quote box |title = |quote =
A Suggestion (not a very nice one)<br />
The following suggestion is used in a book by [[Basil Thomson]]: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed.

In 1940, Fleming and Godfrey contacted [[Kenneth Mason (geographer)|Kenneth Mason]], Professor of Geography at Oxford University, about the preparation of reports on the geography of countries involved in military operations. These reports were the precursors of the [[Naval Intelligence Handbooks|''Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series'']] produced between 1941 and 1946.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clout|first=Hugh|coauthors=Gosme, Cyril |title=The Naval Intelligence Handbooks: a monument in geographical writing|journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]]|date=April 2003|volume=27|issue=2|pages=153-173|doi=10.1191/0309132503ph420oa|accessdate=12 December 2011|at=156|issn=03091325}}</ref>

On 12 September 1940 Fleming wrote a memo to Godfrey that instigated a plan named [[Operation Ruthless]], aimed at obtaining details of the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 3-rotor Enigma|Enigma codes]] used by the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]]. The memo read:

{{Quote box |title =
|quote = 1. Obtain from the [[Air Ministry]] an air-worthy German Bomber<br />
2. Pick a tough crew of five, including a pilot, W/T (wireless/telegraph) operator and word-perfect German speaker. Dress them in [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force ]] uniform, add blood and bandages to suit.<br />
3. Crash plane in the [[English Channel|Channel]] after making [[SOS]] to rescue service in P/L (plain language)<br />
4. Once aboard rescue boat, shoot German crew, dump overboard, bring rescue boat back to England

Much to the annoyance of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Peter Twinn]] at [[Bletchley Park]], the mission was never carried out. Fleming's niece, [[Lucy Fleming]], stated that the reason given was that an official at the [[Royal Air Force]] pointed out that if they were to drop a downed [[Heinkel]] bomber in the English Channel, it would probably sink rather quickly.<ref> [[Lucy Fleming]] ''The Bond Correspondence'', also featuring [[Roger Moore]], [[BBC Radio 4]]. Broadcast on 24 May 2008</ref>

Fleming also worked with [[Colonel]] [[William Joseph Donovan|"Wild Bill" Donovan]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s special representative on intelligence co-operation between London and Washington.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=120}} In May 1941 Fleming accompanied Godfrey to the United States and assisted in writing a blueprint for the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]], the department which turned into the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and eventually became the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].{{sfn|Pearson|1966|p=137}}

===Operation Golden Eye===
In 1941-42 Admiral Godfrey put Fleming in charge of [[Operation Golden Eye]], a plan to maintain an intelligence framework in Spain in the event of a German takeover of the territory.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=124<U+2013>125}} The plan, drawn up by Fleming, involved maintaining communication with [[Gibraltar]] and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=54}} Again Fleming liaised with Donovan over American involvement in ensuring the Germans did not dominate the seaways.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=125}}

===30 Assault Unit===
[[File:30AU emblem.png |thumb|right|200px|30 commando Assault Unit badge]]
In 1942 Fleming had formed a specialist unit of [[British Commandos|commandos]], known as [[No. 30 Commando]], or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), a group of specialist intelligence commandos.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=136}} 30 AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance<U+2014>sometimes in front of it<U+2014> to seize enemy documents from HQs previously targeted.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=2}} The unit was based on a similar German group headed by [[Otto Skorzeny]], who had undertaken similar activities in the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} Fleming thought the German unit was "one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}

Fleming did not fight in the field with the unit, but selected targets and directed operations from the rear.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} On formation the unit was only thirty strong, but grew to five times that size.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} The unit was filled with men from other commando units and trained
In unarmed combat, safe-cracking lock-picking at the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) facilities.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} In late 1942 [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] (later [[Rear admiral]]) Edmund Rushbrooke replaced Godfrey as head of the Naval Intelligence Division and Fleming's influence in the organisation declined, although he still retained control over 30AU.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> Fleming called the unit his "Red Indians",{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=152}} although this annoyed some of the unit's members who had little time for Fleming.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}

Prior to the [[Normandy landings]], most of the operations were in the Mediterranean. However, because of their successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU (based at the Marine Hotel, Littlehampton, West Sussex) became greatly trusted by naval intelligence.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=220}}{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=6}} In March 1944, Fleming oversaw the distribution of intelligence through to Royal Navy units in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]]{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=56}} and he subsequently followed the unit into Germany after they located the German naval archives from 1870, located in Tambach Castle.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=56-57}} Fleming visited 30AU in the field during and after [[Operation Overlord]], especially following an attack on [[Cherbourg]]. He was concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force, rather than as an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Following this, the management of these units was revised.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=220}} Fleming was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}}

===T-Force===
In August 1944, following the success of 30AU, it was decided to establish a "Target Force", which became known as [[T-Force]]. The official memorandum, held at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in London described their primary role:

{{Quote box |title = |quote =
T-Force = Target Force, to guard and secure documents, persons, equipment, with combat and Intelligence personnel, after capture of large towns, ports etc. in liberated and enemy territory.|source = National Archives document WO219/551 (Special Force to Seize Intelligence){{sfn|Longden|2010|p=45}}|align = center |width = 45% |bgcolor = #CFECEC|salign = right}}

Fleming sat on the committee that selected the targets for this unit, helping to create what were known as the "Black Books" which were issued to the officers of this unit.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=51}} The infantry component of [[T-Force]] was in part made up of the 5th Battalion, [[King's Regiment]], which supported the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=78}} It was responsible for securing targets of interest to the British military. These included nuclear laboratories, gas research centres and individual rocket scientists. The unit's most notable coup was during the advance on the German port of [[Kiel]], where it captured the research centre for German engines used for the [[V-2 rocket]], [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] fighters and high speed U-boats.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=198}} Fleming was to use elements of the activities of T-Force, particularly in his 1955 Bond novel ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]''.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=377}}

==1945<U+2014>1953 ==
Fleming was a [[bibliophile]] who, from 1929 onwards and with the assistance of bookseller Percy Muir, collected a library of over one thousand copies of what Fleming described as "books that made things happen."{{sfn| Silver |1999|p=84}} These books represented "milestones in modern science, technology and Western civilization."{{sfn| Silver |1999|p=82}} He concentrated on science and technology, had a copy of Charles Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' but also owned other significant works ranging from Adolf Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to ''[[Scouting for Boys]]''.<ref name="Lilly Library"/> He was a major lender to the 1963 exhibition [[Printing and the Mind of Man]]. Fleming served on the board of ''The Book Collector'' journal, and owned the small publishing firm [[Queen Anne Press]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=227}} In 1970 the collection was acquired by the [[Lilly Library]] at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] for $150,000.(${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1970}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}}){{sfn| Silver |1999|p=88}}
[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goldeneye, where Fleming wrote all the Bond stories.]]
In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica; despite the constant heavy rain during his visit Fleming decided to live on the island once the war was over.{{sfn|Gant|1966|p=51}} His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]] and, in 1945, Fleming had a house built there, which he named [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]].{{sfn|Pearson|1966|p=161}} The name of the house and estate where he wrote his novels has many possible sources. Ian Fleming himself cited both his wartime Operation Golden Eye,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=165}} but also the 1941 novel, ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' by [[Carson McCullers]].{{sfn|Pearson|1966|p=161}}

When Fleming was [[Demobilization of the British Armed Forces after World War II|demobbed]] in May 1945, he joined the Kemsley newspaper group, who at the time owned ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. Fleming became Foreign Manager, overseeing the work of the worldwide network of the paper's correspondents. His contract with Kemsley contained a clause that allowed him to take three months' holiday every winter in Jamaica.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/>

Fleming married Anne Charteris on 24 March 1952 in Jamaica. The ceremony was witnessed by his friend and neighbour, the playwright [[Noel Coward]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=217}} She and Fleming had been having an affair since some point in the 1930s, although at the time she was married to the third Baron O'Neill.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=96}} He was killed in action on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian front]] in 1944 and she expected that she and Fleming would marry afterwards, but Fleming decided to remain a bachelor.<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> Instead, on 28 June 1945, she married the [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|second Viscount Rothermere]].<ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)">{{cite web|last=Lycett|first=Andrew|title=Ann Geraldine Mary [other married names Ann Geraldine Mary O'Neill, Lady O'Neill; Ann Geraldine Mary Harmsworth, Viscountess Rothermere] (1913<U+2013>1981) (Subscription needed)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40227|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=15 December 2011|authorlink=Andrew Lycett|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40227}}</ref>

Despite her marriage to Rothermere, she continued to see Fleming and visited him in Jamaica having told her husband that she was visiting Noel Coward. In 1948 she gave birth to a daughter by Fleming, Mary, although the child lived for only a few hours. In 1951 Rothermere divorced her because of her relationship with Fleming.<ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)"/> Both Fleming and Ann had affairs during their marriage, she, most notably, with [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=295}} Fleming had a long-term affair in Jamaica with one of his neighbours, Blanche Blackwell, mother of [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}}

==Writing career==
[[File:CasinoRoyaleCover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Casino Royale'' was published in 1953: all 4,728 copies were sold in the first month.]]
Although during the war Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel,<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> it was not until 1952 that he began to write his first novel, [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']]. He started writing his book at his [[Jamaica]]n home [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], on 17 February 1952, typing out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination;{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=4}} he finished work on the script in just over two months,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ian Fleming|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=96|work=About Ian Fleming|publisher=Ian Fleming Publications|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> completing it on 18 March 1952.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=4}} He afterwards claimed that he started to write to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1}} Fleming described the work as his "dreadful oafish opus"{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=19}} and showed it to an ex-girlfriend, Clare Blanchard, who advised him not to publish it at all, but that if he did so, it should be under another name.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}}

On 12 May 1952 Fleming had lunch at [[The Ivy]] with his friend [[William Plomer]] and<U+2014>after prompting from Plomer<U+2014>admitted he had written a book.

The novel centred on the exploits of [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]], an intelligence officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Royal Naval Reserve]] [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]]. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American [[ornithologist]] [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], a [[Caribbean]] bird expert and author of the definitive [[field guide]] ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''; Fleming, a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist<U+2019>s wife that "It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=21}} He further explained that:

Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during World War II, admitting that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war".<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)">{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|title= Bond&nbsp;<U+2013> the real Bond|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=36|date=5 April 2008}}</ref> Amongst those types were his brother, Peter, who Fleming worshipped,<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/> and who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.<ref name="PF Obit (1971)">{{cite news|title=Obituary: Colonel Peter Fleming, Author and explorer|newspaper=The Times|date=20 August 1971|page=14}}</ref>

Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], a spy whom Fleming had met whilst skiing in [[Kitzb<U+00FC>hel]] in the 1930s, [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]], who served with distinction in 30 AU during the war, and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale]], station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].<ref name=" Macintyre (2008)"/>{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=68-9}} [[Sir Fitzroy MacLean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy MacLean]] was another figure mentioned as a possibility, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the [[Balkans]], as was the MI6 [[double agent]] [[Du<U+0161>an Popov]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=54}} One of the biggest influence on the Bond character was Fleming himself, who endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming<U+2019>s own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own.<ref name="Cook (2004)">{{cite news|last=Cook|first=William|title=Novel man|newspaper=[[New Statesman]]|date=28 June 2004|page=40}}</ref>

{{Quote box |title = |quote = James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature.

After the publication of ''Casino Royale'', Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story;<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> in total, between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books<U+2014>''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''<U+2014>published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}}

Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or to events he knew of from the Cold War.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|''From Russia, with Love'']] uses the lure of a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine, which had its roots in the German World War II Enigma machine.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} The novel also used the plot device of spies on the [[Orient Express]]: Fleming knew of the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attach<U+00E9> and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]].  Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Saltzberg.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=96}}

Many of the names used in the Bond works are from people Fleming knew: [[Francisco Scaramanga|Scaramanga]] was a fellow schoolboy at Eton, with whom Fleming fought;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] was named after British architect [[Ern<U+0151> Goldfinger]], whose work Fleming abhorred;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} Sir [[Hugo Drax]] was named after an acquaintance of Fleming's, [[Reginald Plunkett|Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax]]{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=88}} (his assistant, Krebbs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff){{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}} whilst one of the homosexual villains from [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|''Diamonds Are Forever'']], 'Boofy' Kidd, was named after one of Fleming's close friends<U+2014>and a relative of his wife<U+2014>[[Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}}

In 1957 Fleming published his first work of non-fiction, ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]'', based on background research for his fourth Bond novel, ''Diamonds Are Forever''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=16<U+2013>17}} Much of the material had been published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and was based on Fleming's interviews with Sir [[Percy Sillitoe]], the ex-[[Director General of MI5]], who had headed up the International Diamond Security Organisation after leaving [[MI5]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}} The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US markets.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}}

Biographer Andrew Lycett noted that following the attacks on his work, allied with marital problems, Fleming "went into a personal and creative decline".<ref name="Lycett (DNB)"/> [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']] had already been written before ''Dr. No'''s publication, so the next book Fleming produced after the criticism was a [[Anthology|collection]] of [[Short story|short stories]], [[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], which were adaptations of outlines written for a television series which did not come to fruition.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=18}} Lycett noted that at the time Fleming was writing both the television scripts, and the short story collection, "Ian's mood of weariness and self-doubt was beginning to affect his writing" and this can be seen in Bond's internal monologue of thoughts.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=369}}

Fleming followed up the book by novelizing a film script that he had worked on with others, the resulting novel being [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']]. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend, Ivar Bryce, introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, [[Kevin McClory]], and the three of them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo worked on a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}} In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter [[Jack Whittingham]] to the writing process{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=374}} and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, Fleming explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}} Additionally, Fleming told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, back out of the deal, or file suit in court.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}}

Fleming then wrote the novel ''Thunderball'' at Goldeneye over the period January to March 1960, based on the screenplay written by himself, Whittingham and McClory.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=20}} In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy of the book and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London for an injunction to stop publication.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} After [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|two court actions]]<U+2014>the second in November 1961<ref name="Sellers (2007)">{{cite news|last=Sellers|first=Robert|title=The battle for the soul of Thunderball|accessdate=18 October 2011|newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]]|date=30 December 2007}}</ref><U+2014>Fleming offered a deal to McClory, settling out of court.

Fleming's books had always sold well, but in 1961 sales increased dramatically. On 17 March 1961<U+2014>four years after it had been published and three years after the heavy criticism of ''Dr. No''<U+2014>''From Russia, with Love'' was listed as one of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F.

===Unfinished or unpublished works===
* The author [[Geoffrey Jenkins]] worked with Fleming on a James Bond story idea between 1957 and 1964. After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] to write a Bond novel, ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'', into a novel, but it was never published.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2000|p=433}}

* In 1960, Fleming was commissioned by the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] to write a book on the country and its oil industry. The typescript is entitled ''State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait'' but it was never published due to disapproval by the [[Kuwait]]i Government. According to Fleming: "The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval. The [[Sheikh]]s concerned found unpalatable certain mild comments and criticisms and particularly the passages referring to the adventurous past of the country which now wishes to be 'civilised' in every respect and forget its romantic origins."<ref name="Lilly Library">{{cite web|title=The Ian Fleming Collection of 19th-20th Century Source Material Concerning Western Civilization together with the Originals of the James Bond-007 Tales: a machine-readable transcription|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/etexts/fleming/|work=Lilly Library Publications Online|publisher=[[Lilly Library]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}}</ref>
