'''Seth''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]], based loosely on the [[Set (mythology)|Set]] of [[Egyptian mythology]].

==Fictional character biography==
Seth is the Egyptian god of evil and death, living in the city of Celestial Helopolis. He is married to the goddess Nepthys. His right hand is missing, and he usually wears a metal cup over it.

Three thousand years ago, Seth dismembered [[Osiris (Marvel Comics)|Osiris]] and scattered the pieces all over Egypt although Isis reassembled her husband, and he then imprisoned his mother [[Isis (Marvel Comics)|Isis]] and brother [[Horus (Marvel Comics)|Horus]] with Osiris in a pyramid. Upon regaining their freedom, Seth attacked them, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] with skeletal horsemen. He was defeated when the energy projected through Odin's axe severed his right hand, and was flung into space.<ref>''Thor'' #240-241</ref>

Seth later attacked Thor in the guise of Donald Blake. Seth brought an army to Earth to battle Thor and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], imprisoned Horus in Heliopolis, and summoned the monstrous Devourer. Seth apparently surrendered when the Devourer went on a rampage.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #22-23</ref>

Much later, Seth plotted to invade [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #386</ref> When it was ready, Seth directed his invasion force to attack Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #390</ref> He endowed three humans with superhuman powers to become his mortal allies, the [[Earth Force (Marvel Comics)|Earth Force]]. Seth attempted to gain the soul of [[Hogun]] the Grim, and commanded a second wave assault on Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' #395-397</ref> He was revealed to have captured Odin in the wake of Odin's battle with [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]] and stole the powers of the Egyptian gods. He successfully conquered Asgard, and battled [[Balder (Marvel Comics)|Balder]].<ref>''Thor'' #398-399</ref> Seth battled Earth Force, Hogun, and the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]]. Seth turned into a huge black serpent, but dwindled into nothingness when the Black Knight's ensorcelled body ripped through his jaws.<ref>''Thor'' #400</ref>

Seth once tried to destroy the [[United Nations]], as part of a plot to instigate a nuclear war, but was thwarted when the hero [[Moon Knight]] destroyed an icon which was the source of Seth's magic.<ref>''Moon Knight'' vol. 4 #4 (Apr 1998)</ref><ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49<U+2013>51 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-14653-141-6}}</ref>

He has extensive knowledge of necromancy, and can resurrect fallen foes as personal thralls,<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #508 (April 1997)</ref> or revive after his body is destroyed.<ref name="JIM513">''Journey into Mystery'' 513 (October 1997)</ref> The character's scale of power has been depicted as rivalling that of [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], and possibly as capable of destroying entire [[galaxy|galaxies]].<ref name="JIM513"></ref>
