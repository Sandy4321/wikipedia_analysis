'''Queen of Heaven''' was a title given to a number of ancient goddesses in the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, in particular [[Anat]], [[Isis]], [[Innana]], [[Astarte]] and possibly [[Asherah]] (by the prophet [[Jeremiah]]). Elsewhere, Nordic [[Frigg]] also bore this title. In Greco-Roman times [[Hera]], and her Roman aspect [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] bore this title. Forms and content of worship varied.  The title [[Queen of Heaven]] was later used by some Christians for [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]].

Isis was venerated first in Egypt. As per the Greek historian [[Herodotus]], writing in the fifth century BCE, Isis was the only goddess worshiped by all Egyptians alike,<ref>Histories 2.42</ref> and whose influence was so widespread by that point, that she had become completely [[Syncretism|syncretic]] with the Greek goddess [[Demeter]]<ref>Histories 2.156</ref>. It is after the conquest of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]], and the [[Hellenization]] of the Egyptian culture initiated by [[Ptolemy I Soter]], that she eventually became known as 'Queen of Heaven'.<ref>R.E Witt, "Isis in the Ancient World", 1997, ISBN 0801856426</ref>
[[Lucius Apuleius]] confirmed this in Book 11, Chap 47 of his novel known as [[The Golden Ass]], in which his character prayed to the "Queen of Heaven". The passage says that the goddess herself responded to his prayer, in which she explicitly identified herself as both the Queen of Heaven and Isis. 
{{quote|Then with a weeping countenance, I made this orison to the puissant Goddess, saying: O blessed Queen of Heaven...
Thus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile Arabia, disdained not with her divine voice to utter these words unto me: Behold Lucius I am come, thy weeping and prayers has moved me to succor thee. I am she that is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, Queen of Heaven... and the Egyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustomed to worship me, do call me Queen Isis.<ref>http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ga/ga48.htm</ref>}}

==Inanna ==
[[Image:Babylon relief.jpg|140px|right|thumb|''The [[Ishtar Gate]] refers to [[Ishtar]] previously known as [[Innana]]'']]
{{main|Inanna}}
Inanna was the Sumerian Goddess of love and war. Despite her association with mating and fertility of humans and animals, Inanna was not a mother goddess, and is rarely associated with childbirth<ref>Fiore, Silvestro. ''Voices From the Clay: the development of Assyro-Babylonian Literature''. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1965.</ref>. Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet Venus.<ref>Jacobsen, Thorkild. ''The Treasures of Darkness: a History of Mesopotamian Religion.'' Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1976.</ref> 

Queen of Heaven is a title used for goddesses central to many religions of antiquity. Inanna's name is commonly derived from ''Nin-anna'' "Queen of Heaven" (from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] [[ERE<U+0160>|NIN]] "lady", [[DINGIR|AN]] "sky")<ref>Wolkstein, Diane and Noah Kramer, Samuel, "Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth" - a modern, poetic reinterpretation of Inanna myths</ref>, although the cuneiform sign for her name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 <U+00012239>) is not historically a ligature of the two.
<!--The name also sounds very close to "[[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]]", the name of the Sumerian moon god, which may indicate that the two deities at one time were one, or they may have a common origin, although once again the cuneiform signatures are very different{{fact|date=June 2007}}. -->
In some traditions Inanna was said to be a granddaughter of the [[Mother Goddess|creator goddess]] [[Nammu]] or Namma.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. These difficulties have led some early Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have been originally a [[Proto-Euphratean]] goddess, possibly related to the [[Hurrian]] mother goddess [[Hannahannah]], accepted only latterly into the Sumerian pantheon, an idea supported by her youthfulness, and that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she at first had no sphere of responsibilities.<ref>Harris, Rivkah (1991), "Inanna-Ishtar as Paradox and a Coincidence of Opposites" (History of Religions, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Feb., 1991)), pp. 261-278</ref>
The view that there was a [[Proto-Euphratean]] substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists<ref>Rubio, Gonzalo (1999), "On the Alleged "Pre-Sumerian Substratum" (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 51, 1999 (1999)), pp. 1-16</ref>. In Sumer '''[[Inanna]]''' was hailed as "Queen of Heaven" in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. In [[Akkad]] to the north, she was worshipped later as '''[[Ishtar]]'''. In the Sumerian ''Descent of Inanna'', when Inanna is challenged at the outermost gates of the underworld, she replies

{{quote|I am Inanna, Queen of Heaven, <br>On my way to the East.}}

Her cult was deeply embedded in Mesopotamia and among the Canaanites to the west.

== Astarte ==

The goddess, the Queen of Heaven, whose worship [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]] so vehemently opposed, may have been possibly [[Astarte]].
Astarte  is the name of a [[goddess]] as known from Northwestern [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] regions, cognate in name, origin and functions with the goddess [[Ishtar]] in [[Mesopotamia]]n texts. Another [[transliteration]] is ''<U+2018>Ashtart''; other names for the goddess include [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] <U+05E2><U+05E9><U+05EA><U+05E8><U+05EA> (transliterated ''Ashtoreth''), [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] ''<U+2018><U+1E6F>trt'' (also ''<U+2018>A<U+1E6F>tart'' or ''<U+2018>Athtart'', transliterated ''Atirat''), [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] <sup>D</sup>''As-tar-t<U+00FA>'' (also ''Astartu'') and [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Uni-Astre'' ([[Pyrgi Tablets]]).

According to scholar [[Mark S. Smith]], Astarte may be the Iron Age (after 1200 BC) incarnation of the Bronze Age (to 1200 BC) [[Asherah]].<ref>{{Citation

Astarte was connected with [[fertility]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[war]]. Her symbols were the [[lion]], the [[horse]], the [[sphinx]], the [[dove]], and a [[star]] within a circle indicating the planet [[Venus]]. Pictorial representations often show her naked. Astarte was accepted by the [[Greece|Greek]]s under the name of [[Aphrodite]]. The island of [[Cyprus]], one of Astarte's greatest faith centers, supplied the name Cypris as Aphrodite's most common byname. Asherah was worshipped in ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] as the consort of El and in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] as the [[wikt:consort|consort]] of [[Yahweh]] and [[Queen of Heaven#Antiquity|Queen of Heaven]] (the Hebrews baked small cakes for her festival):<ref>[[William G.

{{quote|"Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger." <ref>[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:17<U+2013>18</ref>}}

{{quote|"... to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem ..."<ref>Jeremiah 44:17</ref>}}

==Hebrew Bible references==
Worship of a "Queen of Heaven", in Hebrew Malkath haShamayim (<U+05DE><U+05DC><U+05DB><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05E9><U+05DE><U+05D9><U+05DD>) is recorded in the Book of the Prophet [[Jeremiah]], circa 628 BC, in the context of the Prophet condemning such religious worship as [[blasphemy]] and a violation of the teachings of the God of Israel. In Jeremiah 7:18: 

{{quote|"The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger."<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=7&verse=18&version=31&context=verse Biblegateway, Jeremiah 7, 18].</ref>}}

In Jeremiah 44:15-18:

{{quote|"Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present<U+2014>a large assembly<U+2014>and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, "We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine." "<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=44&version=31&context=chapter Biblegateway, Jeremiah 44].</ref>}}

It should be remembered in this context that there was a temple of [[Yahweh]] in Egypt at that time that was central to the Jewish community at [[Elephantine]] in which Yahweh was worshipped in conjunction with the goddess [[Anath]] (also named in the temple papyri as Anath-Bethel and Anath-Iahu).<ref>Dr. Raphael Patai: "The Hebrew Goddess": Duke University Press: third edition</ref>.

The goddesses [[Asherah]], [[Anath]] and [[Astarte]] first appear as distinct and separate deities in the  tablets discovered in the ruins of the library of [[Ugarit]] (modern Ras Shamra, Syria), although some Biblical scholars who have not explored the earlier documented evidence tend to jumble all these goddesses together.

[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] states that "there is nothing in first-millennium BC texts that singles out Asherah as 'Queen of Heaven' or associates her particularly with the heavens at all."<ref>Day, John. ''Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan''. Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (26 Dec 2002). ISBN 978-0826468307, p.&nbsp;146.</ref>
