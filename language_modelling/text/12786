==History==
Before the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] the area was home to the [[Coritani]]; after Roman departure it became part of the [[Anglo Saxon]] [[kingdom of Mercia]].<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/LIN/Algarkirk/ Algarkirk] ''Genuki''; retrieved 25 April 2011</ref> Algarkirk is called after Algar [[Earl of Mercia]], who fell at [[Stow Fair, Lincolnshire#Chapel|Stow Green]] near [[Threekingham]] in 870 while resisting the Danes,<ref name=Cox>Cox, J. Charles (1916); ''Lincolnshire'' p. 42, 43; ''Methuen & Co. Ltd.''; retrieved 25 April 2011</ref> and is reputedly buried in the graveyard<ref>[http://www.uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Lincolnshire/towns/Algarkirk.html Algarkirk] ''UK Genealogy Archives''; retrieved 25 April 2011</ref> of the [[parish church]] of  St Peter and St Paul.
The "kirk" element of the name comes from the [[Old English]] "circe" meaning church, which was later replaced by the [[Old Norse]] "kirk".<ref>{{cite web|title=Algarkirk|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~aezins/kepn/detailpop.php?placeno=10189|work=Institute for Name Studies|publisher=University of Nottingham|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> 

The 9th century church itself is [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English]] and [[Norman architecture|Norman]] with a double aisle [[transept]] and a font of [[Purbeck marble]]. Under the tower are kneeling brass [[effigies]] of Nicholas Robertson (d. 1498), [[Merchants of the Staple|Merchant of the Staple]] of [[Calais]], and his two wives Alice and Isabella. In 1492, he and Isabella glazed the church [[clerestorey]].<ref>Hegbin-Barnes, Penny (1996); ''The medieval stained glass of the county of Lincolnshire'' p. 350 ''Oxford University Press'' ISBN 0-19-726156-6</ref> The church was [[Victorian restoration|heavily restored]] in 1851.<ref name=Cox/>

Hitherto, the parish had formed part of [[Boston Rural District]], in the [[Holland, Lincolnshire|Parts of Holland]]. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as ''parts'') of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the [[Act of Parliament|Local Government Act]] of 1888, Holland had been, in most respects, a county in itself.

==Geography==
The village was once served by [[Algarkirk and Sutterton railway station]] on the now-closed line connecting [[Boston railway station|Boston]] and [[Spalding railway station|Spalding]]. The [[A16 road (England)|A16 road]] has been rebuilt on the former railway so Algarkirk village lies between this and the old road, now the [[B1397 road|B1397]]. The Boston - Algarkirk Diversion opened in October 1991. The village primary school, the Fourfields school, is shared with Sutterton.

The village lies hard against the parish boundary with [[Sutterton]], so that the two parish churches are six or seven hundred metres apart. While most of the parishes in Holland are more or less long and narrow so as to include both [[Salt marsh|saltmarsh]] and [[fen]], this was originally achieved in Algarkirk by having a detached fen about 12 kilometres away, in Holland Fen. This is now part of [[Amber Hill]] parish and ward.

It constitutes part of Five Villages electoral ward, one of eighteen rural wards in the borough, each comprising one or more parishes.
