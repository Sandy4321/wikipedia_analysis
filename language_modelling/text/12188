The '''Peterskirche''' ([[English language|English]]: ''St. Peter's Church'') in [[Vienna]] is a [[church]] with a long and eventful history.

==The first church==
The oldest church building (of which nothing remains today) dates back to the [[Early Middle Ages]], and there is speculation that it could be the oldest church in [[Vienna]] (See [[Ruprechtskirche]]). That Roman church was built on the site of a Roman encampment.

This church was preplaced with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church with a [[nave]] and two [[aisle]]s. It is believed to have been established by [[Charlemagne]] around [[800]], although there is no evidence supporting this view. At the outside of the church, there is a relief [[sculpture]] by R. Weyr [[consecrate]]d to the founding of the church by Charlemagne. In any case, a church of [[Saint Peter]] in Vienna is first mentioned in [[1137]]. Around the end of the [[12th century]], the church became part of the [[Schottenstift]].

The medi<U+00E6>val church had three [[altar]]s, with an [[apse]] in the south instead of the normal eastern orientation. This unusual feature has triggered many discussions among experts, and it is suspected that the church was adapted from a previously secular building. The church was surrounded by shops and a nearby building housed the ''Stadtguardia'', a forerunner of the modern police. The old church burned down in [[1661]] and was given only makeshift repairs. The decision to build a new church was taken up with the arrival of the [[Trinitarian Order|Fraternity of the Holy Trinity]] of which the emperor [[Leopold I]] was a member. He had taken a vow to rebuild this church when Vienna was ravished by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] in [[1679]]-[[1680]].

==The new building==
The construction of the new [[Baroque]] church was begun around [[1701]] under [[Gabriele Montani]], who was replaced by [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] in [[1703]]. The design was inspired by the [[St. Peter's Basilica]] of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in [[Rome]]. By [[1722]], most of the building was finished, and in [[1733]], the ''Peterskirche'' was finally consecrated to the [[Holy Trinity]]. The new church was the first domed structure in [[baroque]] Vienna. Due to the confinement of available space, it was built in a very compact form, with its oval interior housing an astonishing amount of space and rectangular attachments. The church makes an overwhelming impression on the visitor with its surprisingly rich interior filled with golden [[stucco]].

The [[turret]]ed dome was mainly designed by [[Matthias Steinl]], who was also responsible for the interior decoration and the pews with their fabulous [[cherub]]ic heads. The [[fresco]]es were originally painted by the famous Italian [[Andrea Pozzo]], whose paintings were removed after his death. As a result, in [[1713]], [[Johann Michael Rottmayr]] was able to start a completely new set. The fresco in the cupola represents the ''Coronation of Our Lady''. On the triumphal arch one can see the [[coat of arms]] of emperor [[Leopold I]]. In the [[spandrel]]s around the dome are portrayals of the four [[Evangelist]]s and four Fathers of the Church, painted by the Viennese artist J.G. Schmidt. The same artist also painted the altarpiece in the side chapel of St. Michael.

The Baroque high altar was created by [[Antonio Galli Bibiena]] and his [[Bologna|Bolognese]] workshop (construction) and [[Martino Altomonte]] ([[1657]]-[[1745]]) ([[altarpiece]]). The altarpiece portrays the ''Healing of the Lame by St. Peter and St. John in Jerusalem''. The same artist also painted the altarpiece in the side chapel of the [[Holy Family]]. The small painting of the [[Immaculate Conception]] above the [[high altar]] is by the [[19th century]] artist [[Kupelwieser]]. The [[shrine]]s in the side chapels of the Holy Family and St. Michael contain [[martyr]]s from Roman [[catacomb]]s, donated by [[Cardinal Kollonitz]] in [[1733]]. They were put on clothes from this period and placed in the glass coffins.

The gilded ornate pulpit is a magnificent sculpture by [[Matthias Steinl]] ([[1726]]) with on top of the canopy a representation of the Holy Trinity. Opposite the pulpit, there is a dramatic gold-and-silver representation of the ''Martyrdom of St. [[John of Nepomuk]]'', sculpted by [[Lorenzo Mattielli]]. On top of it is the beautiful statue of ''The Mother of God''.

Over the years, the paintings had become darker, and the interior began to take on a grey appearance.  From [[1998]] to [[2004]], the church underwent a renovation, which returned the paintings to their original rich colouring and brightness.

==Access==
The Peterskirche is located on Petersplatz, right next to [[Graben, Vienna|Graben]] and just west of the [[Pests<U+00E4>ule (Vienna)|Pests<U+00E4>ule]]. The street ''Jungferngasse'' cuts through the [[pedestrian zone]] and leads directly to the church. The Peterskirche is largely obscured by the surrounding buildings, and can only be seen clearly from directly in front.
