'''Homegrown''' is a monthly [[drum and bass]] event held at Mercury Live, [[Cape Town]]. It has featured several international and local acts, including [[Dieselboy]], [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]], [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]], [[Donny (drum and bass artist)|Donny]], [[Offkey Recordings|Raiden]], [[Eye-D]], Matt Impact, Robyn Chaos, Temper D, Nymfo, [[DJ SFR|SFR]] and Hyphen. 

Owned and managed by Algorythm Recordings, the event takes place every first Saturday of the month, and is the longest running drum and bass event in [[South Africa]].

==History==
The first Homegrown event was held in September 2000 at The Jam (now Mercury Live).<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/2249702763/in/set-72157603872463865/ | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= [[Flickr]] | title=First ever Homegrown flyer | September 2000}}</ref>  The event was masterminded by Algorythm Recordings. The idea behind it is to get South African drum and bass crews Algorythm, Sublime and Krushed & Sorted under one roof, once a month, for the first time. The focus is promoting artists who produce drum and bass locally, hence the name "Homegrown".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.dnbforum.nl/index.php?op=articles;id=255 Homegrown | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= dnbforum.nl | title= [[Counterstrike (drum and bass group)|Counterstrike]] interview}}</ref> 

In 2001, Mercury Live offered Homegrown a monthly residency, making it a permanent fixture in the [[Music_of_South_Africa#Drum_and_bass|South African drum and bass]] scene.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.mercuryl.co.za/gigs.php | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= Mercury Live | title=Monthly gig list}}</ref> With drum and bass music requiring well-engineered, large sound systems, Algorythm developed a long working relationship with Hellfire Sound.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.hellfire.co.za/ | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= Hellfire | title= Homegrown sound system}}</ref>

==Artist lineups==

==Flyer==
Printed on [[perforated paper]], Homegrown flyers are commonly used as [[joint (cannabis)#Variations|gerrick]] or filters in the preparation of cannabis smoking. Early flyer and logo designs depicted images of [[Cannabis|marijuana]] plants and leaves.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/2249700011/in/set-72157603872463865/ | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= Algorythm Recordings flyer archieve | title= Early Homegrown flyer design}}</ref>  This was later changed to appeal to a much wider audience,<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.flickr.com/photos/23594293@N02/3745956936/ | accessdate=2009-10-06 | publisher= [[Flickr]] | title= More recent Homegrown flyer design}}</ref> however the perforated flyer is still in use.
