The church was built for the English speaking community when the services at St Catherine's were conducted in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].  It was designed by the [[Chester]] firm of [[John Douglas (architect)|Douglas]] & Minshull.  The foundation stone was laid in 1899 by Mrs Eleanor Frost who also paid for many of the church furnishings, including the [[reredos]], altar, rails, screen and the [[pulpit]].  The tower was added in 1912 after the death of John Douglas, when the firm was known as Douglas, Minshull & Muspratt.<ref name=church/>  Starting from 2005 the churchyard has been developed into a community garden.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.oldcolwyneast.co.uk/page4a.html| title = St John's Church Garden Project, Old Colwyn| accessdate = 2&nbsp;June 2009| publisher = Old Colwyn East Residents Association}}</ref>
