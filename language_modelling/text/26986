A '''polarization rotator''' is an optical device that rotates the [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] axis of a [[Linear polarization|linearly polarized]] light beam by an angle of choice. These rotators are either based on the principle of [[birefringence]] or on [[total internal reflection]].<ref name=TLO>[[F. J. Duarte]], ''Tunable Laser Optics'' (Elsevier-Academic, New York, 2003)  Chapter 5.</ref>     

==Wavelength specific polarization rotators==

'''[[Half-wave plate]]s and [[quarter-wave plate]]s''': these rotators work due to the principle of [[birefringence]]. Their performance is wavelength specific; a fact that may be a limitation. Switchable wave plates can also be manufactured out of [[liquid crystals]] or [[ferro-electric liquid crystals]]. These devices can be used to rapidly change the angle of polarization in response to an electric signal.

==Broadband polarization rotators==

'''Double [[Fresnel rhomb]]''':  rotates the linear polarization axis by 90 degrees.  Works on total internal reflection and it uses four internal reflections.  A disadvantage may be a low ratio of useful optical aperture to length.<ref>[[Jean M. Bennett|J. M. Bennett]] and H. E. Bennett, Polarization, in ''Handbook of Optics'', W. G. Driscoll and W. Vaughan, Eds. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1978) Chapter 10. </ref> 

'''Broadband prismatic rotator''':  rotates the linear polarization by 90 degrees.  Works on total internal reflection and it uses seven internal reflections to induce collinear rotation.<ref name=DPR /> The polarization is rotated in the second reflection, but that leaves the beam in a different plane and at a right angle relative to the incident beam.  The other reflections are necessary to yield a beam with its  polarization rotated and collinear with the input beam. These rotators are reported to have transmission efficiencies better than 94%.<ref name=TLO /> The term ''broadband'' indicates that the rotation is independent of wavelength, or achromatic.<ref name=TLO/>  

Rotators of linearly polarized light have found widespread applications in modern optics since [[laser]] beams tend to be linearly polarized and it is often necessary to rotate the original polarization to its orthogonal alternative.<ref name=TLO/>
