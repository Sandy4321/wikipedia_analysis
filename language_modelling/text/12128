The ''' Stamp Act of 1765''' (short title ''Duties in American Colonies Act 1765''; 5 George III, c. 12) was the fourth [[Stamp Act]] to be passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] but the first attempt to impose such a direct tax on its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]].  The act required all legal documents, permits, commercial contracts, newspapers, wills, pamphlets, and playing cards in the colonies to carry a [[tax stamp]].<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 96-97</ref> It was part of an economic program directly affecting colonial policy that was initiated in response to Britain<U+2019>s greatly increased national debt incurred during the British victory in the [[Seven Years War]] (the North American theater of the war was referred to as the [[French and Indian War]]).<ref>Middlekauff pg. 60-62</ref>  

Britain decided to maintain a significant military presence in North America due to the added defense requirements resulting from the vast new territories acquired during the war and conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] in the western frontier exemplified by  the outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763. The British felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of these military preparations, and should pay for at least a portion of the current and future expenses directly incurred in North America.  None of the revenue from the Stamp Act was targeted at reducing the national debt.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 62</ref>  The less controversial (from a colonial standpoint) [[Sugar Act]] of 1764 and the Stamp Act were the initial attempts to raise these funds from the colonists. Parliament announced in April of 1764 when the Sugar Act was passed that they would also consider a stamp tax in the colonies.<ref>Miller pg. 109-113. Morgan and Morgan pg. 75-76. Weslager pg. 50</ref> Stamp taxes had been effective and easy ways to administer a source of revenue within Great Britain for years. Although opposition to this possible tax from the colonies was soon forthcoming, there was little expectation in Britain, either by members of Parliament or American agents in Great Britain such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], of the intensity of the protest that the tax would generate.<ref>Draper 231-233. Middlekauff pg. 77</ref> The Stamp Act was passed by a large majority on 22 March 1765, and went into effect later that year on 1 November.<ref>Weslager pg. 34</ref>  The Associations of the Sons of Liberty of New York was one such group that believed no taxes be imposed upon colonists without their own consent. 

Once in effect, the tax met with great resistance in the colonies.  For over a century the colonists had insisted on their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] to be [[Taxation without representation|taxed only with their consent]] <U+2013> consent which could only be granted through their colonial legislatures. All colonial assemblies sent petitions of protests and the [[Stamp Act Congress]], reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure, also petitioned Parliament and the King.  Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, [[Committees of Correspondence|established connections through correspondence]] that created a loose coalition that extended from New England to Georgia.  Protests and demonstrations initiated by [[Sons of Liberty|these groups]] often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved.  Very soon all stamp tax distributors were intimidated into resigning their commissions, and the tax was never effectively collected.<ref>Draper pg. 216-223. Nash pg. 44-56. Maier pg. 76-106</ref>  

Opposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies.  British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial economic problems exacerbated by the tax, also pressured Parliament.  The Act was repealed on 18 March 1766 as a matter of expedience, but Parliament affirmed its power to tax the colonies <U+201C>in all cases whatsoever<U+201D> by also passing the [[Declaratory Act]]. This incident increased the colonists' concerns about the intent of the British Parliament and added fuel to the growing movement that became the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Middlekauff pg. 111-120.  Miller pg. 149-153</ref>

==Background==

During the [[Seven Years War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]], the British government had substantially increased its [[National Debt|national debt]] to pay for the war, and the acquisition of vast new territories in Canada and Louisiana all the way to the Mississippi opened up new administrative challenges. The ministry headed by [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|John Stuart, the Earl of Bute]], had, by February 1763, made the decision that continuing Indian problems necessitated the maintenance of a standing army of ten thousand British regular troops in the American colonies.  Shortly thereafter George Grenville replaced Bute, and the outbreak of [[Pontiac<U+2019>s Rebellion]] in May 1763 forced   Grenville to adopt an Indian policy that dealt with the new realities.  Grenville was faced not only with the problem of paying for the new troops, but doing so while servicing the national debt that had stood at <U+00A3>75,000 before the war, <U+00A3>122,600,000 in January 1763, and over <U+00A3>800,000,000 by the beginning of 1764.<ref>Gary Nash pg. 45. Middlekauff pg. 55-63. Draper pg. 196-197</ref>
 
Grenville did not expect the colonies to contribute to the interest or the retirement of the debt, but he did expect a portion of the expenses for colonial defense to be paid by the Americans.  Estimating that the expenses of defending the continental colonies and the West Indies to be approximately <U+00A3>200,000 annually, Grenville<U+2019>s goal was that the colonies would be taxed for <U+00A3>78,000 of this needed amount.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 62. Findling and Thackeray pg. 59</ref>  

Prior to the Seven Years War, British colonial policy had largely been determined by informal negotiations between the British Board of Trade and American lobbyists and agents. By 1764 Parliament, aware of the increasing importance of the colonies, began to exercise its previously dormant power to more directly govern the colonies, and the colonists found that they lacked an effective method to influence Parliament's decisions.<ref>Draper pg. 195</ref> 

A key Parliamentary initiative in America was to avoid conflict between the colonists and the Indians in the West.  To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763|Proclamation of 1763]] put an end to white migration beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Ridge]], while stationing 7,500 British troops in the West to both regulate commerce with the Indians and keep settlers out.  To protect British creditors from being repaid in inflated colonial currency, Parliament passed the [[Currency Act|Currency Act of 1764]] which required that all American money had to be based on gold and silver with a one to one ratio with the value of British currency. [[Sugar Act|The Sugar Act of 1764]] was enacted as both a revenue measure and an effort to restrict colonial trade and reduce smuggling.  While all of these acts drew protests from the colonists, it was the Stamp Act that drew the most ire in America.<ref>Ferling pg. 30-31. Draper pg. 201. Miller pg. 115.  Miller argues that the passage of these other acts in fact accelerated to negative reaction to the Stamp Act.</ref>

Historian Theodore Draper wrote:

{{quote|If there was a year of decision, it was 1764.  The way had been prepared the year before with the official end of the Seven Year<U+2019>s War and the promulgation of the first measures which the colonies considered hostile to their interests.  But it was in 1764 that the colonies began to find their ideology of resistance and to rally their forces.  It was also in 1764 that the British began to realize that they were up against something more serious than the usual colonial discontents.   Both sides had no way of knowing how deep was the estrangement.<ref>Draper pg. 234</ref>}}

==British decision-making (April 1764 - April 1765)==

A stamp tax had been a very successful method of taxation within Great Britain.  It generated over one hundred thousand pounds in tax revenue with very little in collection expenses.  By requiring an official stamp on most legal documents, the system was almost self-regulating <U+2013> a document without the required stamp would be null and void under British law.  Imposition of such a tax on the colonies had been considered twice before the Seven Years War and once again in 1761.  Grenville had actually been presented with drafts of colonial stamp acts in September and October 1763, but the proposals lacked the specific knowledge of colonial affairs to describe adequately the documents subject to the stamp. At the time of the passage of the Sugar Act in April 1764, Grenville had made it clear that the right to tax the colonies was not in question, and that additional taxes, including a stamp tax,  might follow.<ref>Miller pg. 109-113.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 75-76.  Weslager pg. 50.</ref>

The Glorious Revolution had established the principle of parliamentary supremacy.  Control of colonial trade and manufactures extended this principle across the ocean. Although this belief had never been tested on the issue of colonial taxation, the British assumed that the interests of the thirteen colonies were too disparate to make joint colonial action against such a tax likely <U+2013> an assumption that had its genesis in the failure of the [[Albany Congress|Albany Conference]] in 1754.  By the end of December 1764 the arrival from the colonies of pamphlets and petitions protesting both the Sugar Act and the proposed stamp tax provided the first warnings of serious colonial opposition.<ref>Draper pg. 216, 230-233</ref>

For Grenville, the first issue was the amount of the tax.  Soon after his announcement of the possibility of a tax, he had told American agents that he was not opposed to the Americans suggesting an alternative way of raising the money themselves. However the only other alternative would be to requisition each colony and allow them to determine how to raise their share.  This had never worked before, even during the French and Indian War, and there was no political mechanism in place that would have insured the success of such cooperation. On February 2, 1765 Grenville met with [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Jared Ingersoll]] from Philadelphia, Richard Jackson the agent for Connecticut, and Charles Garth the agent for South Carolina (Jackson and Garth were also members of Parliament) to discuss the tax.  These colonial representatives had no specific alternative to present; they simply suggested that the determination be left to the colonies.  Grenville replied that he wanted to raise the money "by means the most easy and least objectionable to the Colonies" and Thomas Whately, who had drafted the Stamp Act, said the delay in implementation had been "out of Tenderness to the colonies" and the tax was judged as "the easiest, the most equal and the most certain."<ref>Draper 231-233.  Middlekauff pg. 77.  Ingersoll would accept a position of stamp distributor for Connecticut despite his opposition. Middlekauff pg. 108</ref>

The debate in Parliament began soon after this meeting.  Petitions submitted by the colonies were officially ignored by Parliament. In the debate Charles Townshend had said, "and now will these Americans, children planted by our care, nourished up by our Indulgence until they are grown to a degree of strength and opulence, and protected by our arms, will they grudge to contribute their mite to relieve us from heavy weight of the burden which we lie under?"<ref>Middlekauff  pg. 78-80</ref>  This led to Colonel [[Isaac Barr<U+00E9>]]<U+2019>s response:

{{quote|They planted by your care? No! Your oppression planted <U+2018>em in America. They fled from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and unhospitable country where they exposed themselves to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable, and among others to the cruelties of a savage foe, the most subtle, and I take upon me to say, the most formidable of any people upon the face of God<U+2019>s earth. <U+2026>

They nourished by your indulgence? They grew by your neglect of <U+2018>em. As soon as you began to care about <U+2018>em, that care was exercised in sending persons to rule over 'em, in one department and another, who were perhaps the deputies of deputies to some member of this house, sent to spy out their liberty, to misrepresent their actions and to prey upon 'em; men whose behaviour on many occasions has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil within them <U+2026> .

They protected by your arms? They have nobly taken up arms in your defence, have exerted a valour amidst their constant and laborious industry for the defence of a country whose frontier while drenched in blood, its interior parts have yielded all its little savings to your emolument. <U+2026>The people I believe are as truly loyal as any subjects the king has, but a people jealous of their liberties and who will vindicate them if ever they should be violated; but the subject is too delicate and I will say no more."<ref>Middlekauff pg. 79</ref>}}

The Stamp Act was passed by Parliament on March 22, 1765 with an effective date of November 1, 1765.  It passed 205-49 in the House of Commons and unanimously in the House of Lords.<ref>Weslager pg. 34</ref>  Historians Edmund and Helen Morgan describe the specifics of the tax:

{{quote|The highest tax, <U+00A3>10, was placed <U+2026> on attorney licenses.  Other papers relating to court proceedings were taxed in amounts varying from 3d. to 10s.  Land grants under a hundred acres were taxed 1s. 6d., between 100 and 200 acres 2s., and from 200 to 320 acres 2s. 6d., with an additional 2s 6d. for every additional 320 acres.  Cards were taxed a shilling a pack, dice ten shillings, and newspapers and pamphlets at the rate  of a penny for a single sheet and a shilling for every sheet in pamphlets or papers totaling more than one sheet and fewer than six sheets in octavo, fewer than twelve in quarto, or fewer than twenty in folio (in other words, the tax on pamphlets grew in proportion to their size but ceased altogether if they became large enough to qualify as a book).  The amounts had to be paid in sterling, not in colonial currency, but the administration did not propose thus to draw hard money out of the colonies.  The proceeds of the tax were to be expended in America in procurement of supplies for the troops stationed there.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 96-97.  (Weslager pg. 42) also notes that the paper used had to be pre-stamped in England.  While most paper came from there anyway, there were <U+201C>approximately fifty colonial papermakers who operated their own mills<U+201D> who would suffer from decreased demand for their products.</ref>}}

Two features of the Act involving the courts attracted special attention.  The tax on court documents specifically included courts "exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction." These type of courts did not currently exist in the colonies and no bishops, who would preside over the courts, were currently assigned to the colonies.  Many colonists or their ancestors had fled England specifically to escape the influence and power of such state-sanctioned religious institutions, and they feared this was the first step to reinstating the old ways in the colonies.  Some Anglicans in the northern colonies were already openly advocating the appointment of such bishops, but they were opposed by both southern Anglicans and the non-Anglicans who made up the majority of the northern colonies.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 97-98</ref> 

The Act also, following the example established by the Sugar Act, allowed admiralty courts to have jurisdiction for trying violators.  However admiralty courts had traditionally been limited to cases involved with the high seas .  While the Sugar Act seemed to fall within this precedent, the Stamp Act did not, and the colonists saw this as a further attempt to replace their local courts with courts controlled by England.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 98</ref>

==Colonial Opposition (June 1764 - March 1766)==
===Political responses===
Grenville started appointing Stamp Distributors almost immediately after the Act passed Parliament.  Applicants were not hard to come by because of the anticipated income that the positions promised, and he appointed Americans in each of the thirteen colonies.  Ben Franklin even suggested the appointment of John Hughes as the agent for Pennsylvania, indicating that even Franklin was not aware of the turmoil and impact on American-British relations that the tax was going to generate or that these distributors would become the focus of colonial resistance.<ref>Draper pg. 223.  Weslager pg. 51-52.  Separate appointments were made for Canada (three), Florida (two), and the West Indies (five)</ref>

Debate in the colonies over the Stamp Act had actually begun in the spring of 1764 when Parliament passed a resolution that contained the assertion, "That, towards further defraying the said Expences, it may be proper to charge certain Stamp Duties in the said Colonies and Plantations."  Both the Sugar Act and the proposed Stamp Act were designed principally to raise revenue from the colonists.  The Sugar Act was to a large extent a continuation of past legislation related primarily to the regulation of trade (termed an external tax), but its stated purpose to collect revenue directly from the colonists for a specific purpose was entirely new.  The novelty of the Stamp Act was that it was the first internal tax (a tax based entirely on activities within the colonies) levied directly on the colonies by Parliament. Because of its potential wide application to the colonial economy, the Stamp Act was judged by the colonists to be the most dangerous.<ref>Morgan pg. 311-313.</ref>  

The theoretical issue that would soon hold center stage was the matter of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]]. Benjamin Franklin had raised this as far back as 1754 at the Albany Congress when he wrote, "That it is suppos<U+2019>d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed  but by their own Consent given thro<U+2019> their Representatives. That the Colonies have no Representatives in Parliament."<ref>Draper pg. 216</ref>  The counter to this argument was the theory of virtual representation. [[Thomas Whately]] enunciated this theory in a pamphlet that readily acknowledged that there could be no taxation without consent, but the facts were that at least 75% of British  adult males were not represented in Parliament because of  property qualifications or other factors.  Since members of Parliament were bound to represent the interests of all British citizens and subjects, colonists, like those disenfranchised subjects in the British Isles, were the recipients of virtual representation in Parliament.<ref>Morgan (1956) pg. 19</ref>  This theory, however, ignored a crucial difference between the unrepresented in Britain and the colonists.  The colonists enjoyed actual representation in their own legislative assemblies, and the issue was whether these legislatures, rather than Parliament, were in fact the sole recipients of the colonists consent with regard to taxation.<ref>Draper pg. 216-217</ref>

In May 1764 [[Samuel Adams]] of Boston drafted the following that stated the common American position:

{{quote|For if our Trade may be taxed why not our Lands?  Why not the Produce of our Lands & every thing we possess or make use of?  This we apprehend annihilates our Charter Right to govern & tax ourselves <U+2013> It strikes our British Privileges, which as we have never forfeited them, we hold in common with our Fellow Subjects who are Natives of Britain: If Taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal Representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the Character of free Subjects to the miserable State of tributary Slaves.<ref>Draper pg. 219</ref>}}

Massachusetts appointed a five member [[Committee of Correspondence]] in June 1764 to coordinate action and exchange information regarding the Sugar Act, and in October 1764 Rhode Island formed a similar committee.  This attempt at unified action represented a significant step forward in colonial unity and cooperation. The Virginia House of Burgesses in December 1764 sent a protest of the taxes to London, arguing that they did not have the specie required to pay the tax.<ref>Weslager pg.58-59. Ferling pg 33. </ref>  Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut also sent protest to England in 1764.  While the content of the messages varied, they all emphasized that taxation of the colonies without colonial assent was a violation of their rights.  By the end of 1765 all of the colonies except Georgia and North Carolina had sent some sort of protest passed by colonial legislative assemblies.<ref>Morgan pg. 314-315.  Draper pg. 223</ref>

The [[House of Burgesses|Virginia House of Burgesses]] reconvened in early May 1765 after news of the passage of the Act was received. By the end of May it appeared they would not consider the tax and many legislators, including [[George Washington]], went home. Only 30 out of 116 Burgesses remained, but one of those remaining was [[Patrick Henry]] who was attending his first session.  Henry led the opposition to the Stamp Act and his resolutions, proposed May 30, 1765, were passed in the form of the [[Virginia Resolves]].<ref>Ferling pg. 32-34.  Middlekauff pg. 83</ref>  The Resolves stated:

{{quote|Resolved, That the first Adventurers and Settlers of this his majesty's colony and Dominion of Virginia brought with them, and transmitted to their Posterity, and all other his Majesty's subjects since inhabiting in this his Majesty's said Colony, all the Liberties, privileges, Franchises, and Immunities that have at any Time been held, enjoyed, and possessed, by the People of Great Britain.

Resolved, That by the two royal Charters, granted by King James the First, the Colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to all Liberties, Privileges, and Immunities of Denizens and natural Subjects, to all Intents and Purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within the Realm of England.

Resolved, That the Taxation of the People by themselves, or by Persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who could only know what Taxes the People are able to bear, or the easiest method of raising them, and must themselves be affected by every Tax laid on the People, is the only Security against a burdensome Taxation, and the distinguishing characteristick of British Freedom, without which the ancient Constitution cannot exist.

Resolved, That his majesty's liege people of this his most ancient and loyal Colony have without interruption enjoyed the inestimable Right of being governed by such Laws, respecting their internal Polity and Taxation, as are derived from their own Consent, with the Approbation of their Sovereign, or his Substitute; and that the same hath never been forfeited or yielded up, but hath been constantly recognized by the King and People of Great Britain.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 84. The Resolves were widely reprinted and many versions of them are still seen.  Middlekauff used the wording from the journal of the House of Burgesses.</ref>}}

On June 6, 1765 the Massachusetts Lower House proposed a meeting for the 1st Tuesday of October in New York City:

{{quote|That it is highly expedient there should be a Meeting as soon as may be, of Committees from the Houses of Representatives or Burgesses in the several Colonies on this Continent to consult together on the present Circumstances of the Colonies, and the difficulties to which they are and must be reduced by the operation of the late Acts of Parliament for levying Duties and Taxes on the Colonies, and to consider of a general and humble Address to his Majesty and the Parliament to implore Relief.<ref>Weslager pg. 60</ref>}}

There was no attempt to keep this meeting a secret; Massachusetts promptly notified its agent in England, a member of Parliament, of the proposed meeting.<ref>Weslager pg. 65</ref>

===Protests in the streets===

While the colonial legislatures were acting, the ordinary citizens of the colonies were also voicing their concerns outside of this formal political process.  Historian Gary B. Nash wrote:

{{quote|Whether stimulated externally or ignited internally, ferment during the years  from 1761 to 1766 changed the dynamics of social and political relations in the colonies and set in motion currents of reformist sentiment with the force of a mountain wind.  Critical to this half decade was the colonial response to England<U+2019>s Stamp Act, more the reaction of common colonists than that of their presumed leaders. <U+2026><ref>Nash pg. 44</ref>

Both loyal supporters of English authority and well-established colonial protest leaders underestimated the self-activating capacity of ordinary colonists.  By the end of 1765 <U+2026> people in the streets had astounded, dismayed, and frightened their social superiors.<ref>Nash pg. 59</ref>}}

====Massachusetts====
Early street protests were most notable in Boston.  On August 14, 1765 Andrew Oliver, distributor of stamps for Massachusetts, was hung in effigy "from a giant elm tree at the crossing of Essex and Orange Streets in the city<U+2019>s South End."  Also hung was a Jack boot painted green on the bottom ("a Green-ville sole") <U+2013> a pun on both Grenville and the Earl of Bute, the two persons most blamed by the colonists. The sheriff, Stephen Greenleaf, was ordered by Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson to take the effigy down, but was opposed by a large crowd.  All day the crowd detoured merchants on Orange Street to have their goods symbolically stamped under the elm (the elm tree later became known as the "[[Liberty Tree]]").  At night a crowd, led by Ebenezer MacIntosh, a Seven Years<U+2019> War veteran and current shoemaker, cut down the mock Oliver and took it in a funeral procession to the Town House where the legislature met.  From there they went to Oliver<U+2019>s office, tore it down, symbolically stamped the timbers, and took the effigy to Oliver<U+2019>s home at the foot of Fort Hill where they beheaded and burned the effigy along with Oliver<U+2019>s stable house and coach and chaise.  Greenleaf and Hutchinson were stoned when they tried to stop the mob which then proceeded to loot and destroy the contents of Oliver<U+2019>s house.  Oliver asked to be relieved of his duties the next day.<ref>Nash pg. 45-47</ref> This resignation however was not enough.  Oliver was ultimately forced by MacIntosh to be paraded through the streets and publicly resign under the Liberty Tree.<ref>Nash pg. 53</ref>

On August 26, MacIntosh led an attack on Hutchinson<U+2019>s house.  The mob evicted the family, destroyed the furniture, tore down the interior walls, and emptied the wine cellar.  Hutchinson, who had been in public office for three decades estimated his loss at 2,218 pounds (in today<U+2019>s money, at nearly $250,000).  Nash concludes that this attack was more than just a reaction to the Stamp Act:

{{quote|But it is clear that the crowd was giving vent to years of resentment at the accumulation of wealth and power by the haughty prerogative faction led by Hutchinson.  Behind every swing of the ax and every hurled stone, behind every shattered crystal goblet and splintered mahogany chair, lay the fury of a plain Bostonian who had read or heard the repeated references to impoverished people as "rable" and to Boston<U+2019>s popular caucus, led by Samuel Adams, as a "herd of fools, tools, and synchophants."<ref>Nash pg.48</ref>}}

Governor Bernard offered a 300 pound reward for information on the leaders of the mob, but no information came forward. MacIntosh and several others were arrested, but were freed either by pressure from the merchants or released by mob action.<ref>Nash pg. 49-50</ref>

The street demonstrations originated from the leadership of respectable public leaders such as [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] who commanded the Boston Gazette and [[Samuel Adams]] of the "Loyal Nine" of the Boston Caucus, an organization of Boston merchants. They made efforts to control the folks below them on the economic and social scale, but they were often unsuccessful in maintaining a delicate balance between mass demonstrations and riots.  These men  needed the support of the working class, but also had to establish the legitimacy of their actions to have their protests to England taken seriously.<ref>Nash pg. 49</ref>  The Loyal Nine, in the autumn, was more of a social club with political interests than anything else.  Only in December 1765 did they begin issuing statements as the Sons of Liberty.<ref>Maier pg. 85</ref>

====Rhode Island====
The street violence spread. In Newport, Rhode Island, on August 27, a crowd built a gallows near the Town House where they carried effigies of Augustus Johnson, the Rhode Island stamp distributor and two other conservative local figures, Dr. Thomas Moffat and lawyer Martin Howard Jr. The crowd was originally led by three merchants, William Ellery, Samuel Vernon, and Robert Crook, but they soon lost control. That night the crowd, led by a poor man, John Weber, attacked the houses of Moffat and Howard <U+2013> destroying walls, fences, art, furniture and wine.   When Weber was arrested, the local Sons of Liberty, publicly opposed to violence, refused at first to support him until they were persuaded to come to his assistance when retaliation was threatened against their own homes.  Weber was released and faded into obscurity.<ref>Nash pg. 50-51</ref>

====New York====
{{main|Province of New York#Stamp Act}}
In New York, James McEvers resigned his distributorship four days after the attack on Hutchinson<U+2019>s house.  The stamps for several of the northern colonies arrived in New York Harbor on October 24.  Placards appeared throughout the city warning , "the first man that either distributes or makes use of stamped paper let him take care of his house, person, and effects."  New York merchants met on October 31 and agreed not to sell any English goods until the Act was repealed.  Crowds of people, uncontrolled by the local leaders, took to the streets for four days of demonstrations, culminating in an attack by two thousand people on Governor Cadwallader Colden<U+2019>s home and the burning of two sleighs and a coach. Unrest in New York City  continued through the end of the year, and the Sons of Liberty had difficulty in controlling them.<ref>Nash pg. 53-55</ref>

====Other Colonies====
Other popular demonstrations occurred in Portsmouth NH;  Annapolis; Wilmington and New Bern in North Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina.  In Philadelphia, demonstrations were subdued but even targeted Benjamin Franklin's home, although it was not vandalized.<ref>Nash pg. 55-56</ref> By November 16, twelve of the stamp distributors had resigned.  The Georgia distributor did not arrive in America until January, but his first action was to resign.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 98</ref>

====Sons of Liberty====
{{main|Sons of Liberty}}

It was during this time of street demonstrations that locally organized groups started to merge into an inter-colonial organization of a type not previously seen in the colonies.  Although the term "sons of liberty" had been used in a generic fashion well before 1765, it was only around February 1766 that its influence as an organized group, using the formal name "Sons of Liberty", extended throughout the colonies, leading to the development of a pattern for future resistance to the British that would carry the colonies towards 1776.<ref>Maier pg. 76-82.  Maier noted that the term "sons of liberty", used in the generic sense, was used as early as the 1750s in some Connecticut documents.</ref> Historian John C. Miller noted that the name was adopted as a result of Barre's use of the term in his February 1765 speech.<ref>Miller pg. 130</ref>

The organization spread month by month after independent starts in several different colonies. By November 6, a committee was set up in New York to correspond with other colonies, and in December an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  In January, there was established a correspondence link between Boston and Manhattan, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, New Hampshire, and Newport, Rhode Island. Also, by March, Sons of Liberty organizations had been established in New Jersey, Maryland, and Norfolk, Virginia, and a local group established in North Carolina was attracting interest in South Carolina and Georgia.<ref>Maiers pg. 78-81</ref>  

While the officers and leaders of the Sons of Liberty <U+201C>were drawn almost entirely from the middle and upper ranks of colonial society,<U+201D> they recognized the need to expand their power base to include "the whole of political society, involving all of its social or economic subdivisions." In order to do this, the Sons of Liberty relied on large public demonstrations to expand their base.<ref>Maier pg. 86-88</ref>  They learned early on that controlling such crowds was problematical, although they strived to control "the possible violence of extra-legal gatherings."  While the organization professed its loyalty to both local and British established government, possible military action as a defensive measure was always part of their considerations.  Throughout the Stamp Act Crisis, the Sons of Liberty professed continued loyalty to the King because they maintained a "fundamental confidence" in the expectation that Parliament would do the right thing and repeal the tax.<ref>Maier pg. 101-106.  Miller pg. 139. Miller wrote, "Had Great Britain attempted to enforce the Stamp Act, there can be little doubt that British troops and embattled Americans would have shed each other<U+2019>s blood ten years before Lexington. As Benjamin Franklin remarked, a British army would not have found a rebellion in the American colonies in 1765 but it would have made one."</ref>

===Stamp Act Congress===
{{main|Stamp Act Congress}}

The first Stamp Act Congress was held in New York in October 1765.  Historian John C. Miller noted:

{{quote|The composition of this Stamp Act Congress ought to have been convincing proof to the British government that resistance to parliamentary taxation was by no means confined to the riffraff of colonial seaports.  The members were some of the most distinguished men in the colonies.<ref>Miller pg. 137</ref>}}

The youngest was 26 year old [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina, and the oldest was 65 year old [[Hendrick Fisher]] of New Jersey. Ten of the delegates were lawyers, ten were merchants, and seven were planters or land owning farmers; all had served in some type of elective office and all but three were born in the colonies.  Four would die before the colonies declared independence, and four would sign the Declaration of Independence; nine would attend the first and second Continental Congresses, and three would be loyalists during the Revolution.<ref>Weslager pg. 108-111</ref>  New Hampshire declined to send any delegates, and North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia were not represented because their governors did not call the legislatures into session in order to decide whether to attend.  Eventually every colony affirmed the decisions of the Congress.<ref>Miller pg. 137-139.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 139</ref> Six of the nine colonies represented at the Congress agreed to sign the petitions to the king and parliament produced by the Congress. The delegations from New York, Connecticut, and South Carolina were prohibited from signing any documents without first receiving approval from the colonal assemblies that had appointed them.<ref>Weslager pg. 148</ref>  

Massachusetts governor [[Francis Bernard]] believed that his colony<U+2019>s delegates to the Congress would be supportive of Parliament.  [[Timothy Ruggles]] was especially Bernard<U+2019>s man and was elected chairman of the Congress.  Ruggles' instructions from Bernard were to "recommend submission to the Stamp Act until Parliament could be persuaded to repeal it."<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 140-141</ref>  Many delegates felt that a final resolution of the Stamp Act would actually bring Britain and the colonies closer together. [[Robert Livingston (1718-1775)|Robert Livingston]] of New York, stressing the importance of removing the Stamp Act from the public debate, wrote to his colony<U+2019>s  agent in England, "If I really wished to see America in a state of independence I should desire as one of the most effectual means to that end that the stamp act should be enforced."<ref>Weslager pg. 109</ref> 

The congress met for 12 days including Sundays.  There was no audience at the meetings, and no information about the deliberations was released during or after the congress.<ref>Weslager pg. 115.  Morgan and Morgan pg. 142</ref>  Their final product was called "The Declaration of Rights and Grievances", and was drawn up by delegate [[John Dickinson]] of  Pennsylvania. This Declaration raised fourteen points of colonial protest. In addition to the specifics of the Stamp Act taxes, it asserted that colonists rightfully possessed all the rights of Englishmen and but that without [[right to vote|voting rights]], Parliament could not represent the colonists; only the colonial assemblies had a right to tax the colonies; that [[trial by jury]] was a right which the recent use of [[Admiralty court|Admiralty Courts]] abused.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 145-152.  The actual resolutions are available at http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/sac65.htm</ref>
  
It is significant that in addition to simply arguing for their rights as Englishmen, they also asserted that they had certain natural rights solely because they were human beings.  Resolution 3 stated, "That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives."  Both Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in separate resolutions would bring forth the issue even more directly when they referred, respectively, to "the Natural rights of Mankind" and "the common rights of mankind".<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 151-152.  The authors concluded, "Thus by the fall of 1765 the colonists had clearly laid down the line where they believed that Parliament should stop, and they had drawn that line not merely as Englishmen but as men."</ref>

[[Christopher Gadsden]] of South Carolina had proposed that since the rights of the colonies did not originate with Parliament that the Congress<U+2019> petition should go only to the King. This radical proposal went too far for most delegates and was rejected. The "Declaration of Rights and Grievances" was duly sent to the king, and petitions were also sent to both Houses of Parliament.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg. 147-148</ref>

==Repeal (December 1765 - March 1766)==

Grenville was replaced as Prime Minister on July 10, 1765 by [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Lord Rockingham]], the first lord of the treasury.  News of the mob violence began to reach England in October. At the same time that resistance in America was building and accelerating, conflicting sentiments were taking hold in Britain. Some wanted to strictly enforce the Stamp Act over colonial resistance, wary of the precedent that would be set by backing down.  

Others, feeling the economic effects of reduced trade with America after the Sugar Act and an inability to collect debts while the colonial economy suffered, began to lobby for a repeal of the Stamp Act.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 111-113.  Miller pg. 149-151</ref> A significant part of colonial protest had included various non-importation agreements among merchants who recognized that a significant portion of British industry and commerce was dependent on the colonial market.  This movement had spread through the colonies with a significant base coming from New York City where 200 merchants had met and agreed to import nothing from England until the Stamp Act was repealed.<ref>Morgan and Morgan pg.49-50, pg. 331</ref>  

When Parliament met in December 1765, it rejected a resolution offered by Grenville, who remained in Parliament, that would have condemned colonial resistance to the enforcement of the Act.  Outside of Parliament Rockingham and his secretary and member of Parliament, [[Edmund Burke]], organized London merchants who in turn started a committee of correspondence itself to support repeal of the Stamp Act by urging merchants throughout the country to contact their local representatives in Parliament concerning repeal.  When Parliament reconvened on January 14, 1766, the Rockingham ministry formally proposed repeal.  Amendments that would have lessened the financial impact on the colonies by allowing colonists to pay the tax in their own script were considered to be too little and too late.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 113-114.  Miller pg. 153.  Miller wrote of the Rockingham ministry, "Of all the Whig factions, the Rockinghams were most benevolent toward the colonies.  While they were as determined <U+2026>as [other factions] to maintain the sovereignty of great Britain , they insisted the Americans must be treated as customers rather than as rebellious rogues who merited a sound whipping."</ref>

[[William Pitt]], in the Parliamentary debate, stated that everything done by the Grenville ministry with respect to the colonies "has been entirely wrong."  He further stated, "It is my opinion that this Kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the colonies." While Pitt still maintained that "the authority of this kingdom over the colonies, to be sovereign and supreme, in every circumstance of government and legislature whatsoever," he made the distinction that taxes were not part of governing, but were "a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons alone."  He rejected the notion of virtual representation, as "the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of man."<ref>Middlekauff pg. 115</ref>

Grenville responded to Pitt:

{{quote|Protection and obedience are reciprocal.  Great Britain protects America; America is bound to yield obedience.  If, not, tell me when the Americans were emancipated?  When they want the protection of this kingdom, they are always ready to ask for it.  That protection has always been afforded them in the most full and ample manner.  The nation has run itself into an immense debt to give them their protection; and now they are called upon to contribute a small share towards the public expence, and expence arising from themselves, they renounce your authority, insult your officers, and break out, I might also say, into open rebellion.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 116</ref>}}

Pitt<U+2019>s response to Grenville included, "I rejoice that America has resisted.  Three millions of people, so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves of the rest."<ref>Middlekauff pg. 116-117</ref>

Between January 17 and 27, Rockingham shifted the attention from constitutional arguments to economic by presenting petitions from all over the country complaining of the economic repercussions felt throughout the country.  On February 7, the House of Commons rejected a resolution, saying it would back the King in enforcing the Act by 274-134.  In an attempt to address both the constitutional and the economic issues, Secretary of State Henry Conway introduced the [[Declaratory Act]] which affirmed the right of Parliament to tax the colonies "in all cases whatsoever" while admitting the inexpediency of attempting to enforce the Stamp Act.  Only Pitt and three or four others voted against it. Other resolutions did pass which condemned the riots and demanded compensation from the colonies for those who suffered losses because of the actions of the mobs.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 117-119</ref>

On February 21, a resolution to repeal the Stamp Act was introduced and passed by a vote of 276-168.  The King agreed to the repeal on March 17, 1766.<ref>Middlekauff pg. 120</ref>

==Later effects==

Some aspects of the resistance to the act provided a sort of rehearsal for the resistance to the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.  In the American Revolution a decade later, the Committees of Correspondence reappeared on a more formal basis. The boycott also became more formalized, as the colonies entered into a non-importation agreement in 1774 known as the [[Continental Association]]. While the Sons of Liberty faded after the repeal, they were never again entirely absent. The ability of the colonies to act in concert would also reappear in the [[Continental Congress]].

The colonists also came to believe that they could nullify an Act of Parliament by generally  peaceful means. The issue of ''[[no taxation without representation]]'' was raised, but not resolved.  The constitutional stakes would soon be raised higher. Still, the determination of Parliament to tax the colonists persisted.
