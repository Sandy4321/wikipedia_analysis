The '''1952 Farnborough Airshow DH.110 crash''' was an [[List of airshow accidents|air show accident]] involving a [[de Havilland Sea Vixen|de Havilland DH.110]] that killed 29 spectators, the pilot [[John Derry]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rivas |first1=Brian |last2=Bullen |first2=Annie |author3=Duke, Neville (forward) |year=1982 |title=John Derry: The Story of Britain's First Supersonic Pilot |publisher=William Kimber |isbn=0-7183-0099-8 }}</ref> and the onboard flight test observer Anthony Richards.<ref name=bbc2>{{Cite web

The cause was a faulty wing leading edge design. The DH.110 was grounded and strict safety procedures were subsequently enacted.

No member of the public has been killed at a British [[air show]] since.<ref name = 'BBC archive'>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2981000/2981786.stm "On This Day - 1952: Dozens die in air show tragedy."] ''BBC News,'' 2008.</ref>{{efn|Although four members of the public were killed while on a helicopter experience at the Biggin Hill Air Show in 1978<ref>[http://www.aaib.gov.uk/sites/aaib/publications/formal_reports/2_1978_g_avsn_and_g_ande.cfm AAIB Report on 1978 accident at Biggin Hill]</ref>}} After modifications to the design the DH.110 entered service with the Royal Navy as the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]].

==Crash==
The planned demonstration of the DH.110 on that day was nearly cancelled when the aircraft at Farnborough, an all-black night fighter prototype, became unserviceable. It had been taken supersonic over the show on the opening day.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%202697.html ''Flight'' 12 September 1952]</ref> Derry and Richards left Farnborough to collect ''WG 236'' and flew it from Hatfield to Farnborough with just enough time to start their slot.

Following a low-level [[supersonic]] [[flypast]] and during a left bank at about 450&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]] (830&nbsp;km/h) toward the air show's 120,000 spectators, the pilot started a climb. The outer starboard wing and, immediately afterward, the outer port wing broke off the aircraft; followed by both engines and the cockpit<U+2014>the latter injuring several spectators.<ref name=bbc>{{Cite web

 | date=6 September 1952 | accessdate = 3 May 2010 |quote=This caused a sudden change in the centre of gravity, causing the plane to rear up with such force that the cockpit section, with Derry and Richards still inside, broke off at 12g while the two engines tore loose from the airframe and the tailplane ripped off. One engine ploughed into spectators on the so-called Observation Hill and the other crashed harmlessly, while the cockpit fell right in front of spectators nearest the runway, injuring several people. The main airframe fluttered down and landed on the other side of the airfield.}}</ref>  One engine broke into two sections and "ploughed into ... Observation Hill", injuring and killing numerous other spectators.<ref name=bbc/>

One eyewitness was Richard Gardner, then five years old. "I'll never forget, it looked like confetti, looked like silver confetti. The remaining airframe floated down right in front of us. It just came down like a leaf. And then the two engines, like two missiles, shot out of the airframe and hurtled in the direction of the airshow. There was a sort of silence, then people, one or two people screamed but mostly it was just a sort of shock. You could hear some people sort of whimpering which was quite shocking."<ref> Jet!

Following the accident the air display programme continued once the debris was cleared from the runway, with [[Neville Duke]] exhibiting the prototype [[Hawker Hunter]] and taking it supersonic over the show later that day.

==Aftermath==
Both [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] and [[Duncan Sandys]], the [[Minister of Supply]], sent messages of condolence, and jets at [[air show]]s were obliged to keep at least {{convert|230|m|ft|abbr=on}} from crowds if flying straight and {{convert|450|m|ft|abbr=on}} when performing manoeuvres and always at an altitude of at least {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bbc2/> 
The coroner's jury recorded the deaths of Derry and Richards as "died accidentally in the normal course of their duty."

Of the spectators killed the jury recorded that "the deaths were accidental" adding that "no blame is attached to Mr. John Derry".<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1952/1952%20-%202755.html ''Flight'' 19 September 1952]</ref>  The accident report of 8 April 1953 stated the manoeuvring had caused an [[airframe]] instability because of a faulty D-nose leading edge arrangement (which had successfully been used in the lighter subsonic [[de Havilland Vampire]]). The redesigned DH.110 resumed flights in June 1953 and was eventually developed into the [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] naval fighter<ref>{{cite web
