'''Delaware Route 279''' ('''DE 279''') is a {{convert|1.05|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] located in northern [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Delaware]].  It runs from the [[Maryland]] state line southwest of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], where it continues as [[Maryland Route 279]] (MD 279), northeast to [[Delaware Route 4|DE 4]] and [[Delaware Route 896|DE 896]] in Newark. DE 279 follows a four-lane [[divided highway]] called Elkton Road and serves as part of the route connecting [[Elkton, Maryland]] with Newark. The roadway is maintained by the [[Delaware Department of Transportation]] (DelDOT). DE 279 was originally the westernmost portion of [[Delaware Route 2|DE 2]], designated in the 1930s. This portion of road was widened into a divided highway in 1972. In 2013, DE 2 was truncated from the Maryland border to east of Newark to simiplify the route designations through Newark, resulting in DE 279 being designated to its current alignment.

==Route description==
[[File:Delaware State Route 279 westbound beginning.jpg|thumb|right|The beginning of westbound DE 279]]
DE 279 begins at the [[Maryland]] border southwest of [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]. The road continues southwest into that state as [[Maryland Route 279|MD 279]], which heads towards [[Elkton, Maryland|Elkton]]. From the state line, the route heads northeast on Elkton Road, a four-lane [[divided highway]]. DE 279 heads through commercial areas of Newark, where it comes to an intersection with Otts Chapel Road (Road 397). The road continues past more commercial development and comes to an intersection with the western terminus of [[Delaware Route 4|DE 4]] and [[Delaware Route 896|DE 896]] (Christiana Parkway). Here, DE 279 ends and Elkton Road continues northeast as part of DE 896 towards downtown Newark. The entire length of the route is located in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]].<ref name="google">{{google maps |url=http://goo.gl/maps/WjzYl|title=overview of Delaware Route 279|accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=usgs>{{Cite map |publisher=United States Geological Survey |publisher-link= United States Geological Survey |title=Newark West Quadrangle: Delaware&ndash;Maryland&ndash;Pennsylvania |year=2011 |scale=1 : 24,000 |series=7.5 Minute Series (Topographic) | OCLC = 794112185 |isbn= }}</ref> The route passes through flat to gently rolling terrain at an elevation of about {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref name=usgs/>

==History==
What is now DE 279 was originally an unimproved county road by 1920.<ref name="DE 1920 map">{{Delaware road map|year=1920}}</ref> By 1924, the road was paved.<ref name="DE 1924 map">{{Delaware road map|year=1924}}</ref> In 1925, suggestions were made for the state to take over maintenance of the highway connecting the Maryland border to Newark.<ref name="1925 report">{{cite journal|title=Annual Report of the State Highway Department|edition=1925|page=21|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=December 31, 1925|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1925/annual_1925.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name="1926 report">{{cite journal|title=Delaware State Highway Department Report|edition=1926|page=35|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=December 31, 1926|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1926/annual_1926_chief.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>  In 1927, the state took over maintenance of the highway between the Maryland border and Newark.<ref name="1927 report">{{cite journal|title=Annual Report of the State Highway Department|edition=1927|page=28|publisher=Delaware State Highway Department|location=Dover, Delaware|date=December 31, 1927|url=http://www.deldot.gov/archaeology/historic_pres/annual_reports/pdf/1927/annual_1927_chief.pdf|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref> When Delaware designated its state highways by 1936, the current alignment of DE 279 was designated as the westernmost part of [[Delaware Route 2|DE 2]], which ran from the Maryland border through Newark east to [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]].<ref name="DE 1936 map">{{Delaware road map|year=1936}}</ref> The portion of DE 2 along Elkton Road between the Maryland border and Newark was widened into a divided highway in 1972.<ref name="MD 1972 map">{{Maryland road map|year=1972}}</ref> In 2013, [[Delaware Department of Transportation|DelDOT]] proposed the renumbering of routes in and around Newark, which involved truncating DE 2 from the Maryland border to the eastern edge of Newark and the removal of [[Delaware Route 2 Business|DE 2 Bus.]] through downtown Newark. As a result of these changes, the portion of Elkton Road between the Maryland border and the Christiana Parkway was to be designated as DE 279. The goal of the project was to "simplify the route designations in Newark, reduce sign clutter, and reduce sign maintenance costs." The changes were completed in summer 2013.<ref name="Proposed Route Designation Changes in Newark">{{cite web|last=Shannon|first=Josh|title=A route to less clutter: DelDOT to consolidate Newark route numbers|url=http://www.newarkpostonline.com/news/article_081d2586-e14b-11e2-94de-001a4bcf887a.html|work=Newark Post|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}</ref>
