'''Pig milk''' is milk from pigs. Pigs are considered difficult to milk. There are 8 to 10 small nipples, each giving little milk. Also, the sow itself is reluctant to be milked.<ref>http://modernfarmer.com/2014/03/milk-pig/</ref> Other issue making pigs less appealing as a source of milk than other, more conventional animals, is the cleanliness and diet of pigs.<ref>http://www.thekitchn.com/why-dont-pigs-make-cheese-73719</ref>
