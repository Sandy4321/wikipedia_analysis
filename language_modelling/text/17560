The '''College of All Saints''' was an [[collegiate church|ecclesiastical college]] in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]] founded in 1395 by [[William Courtenay|Archbishop Courtenay]]. It was part of the establishment of the nearby [[Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone|Archbishop's Palace]], but was closed in 1546. The College church was the neighbouring [[All Saints Church, Maidstone|Church of All Saints]]. A number of the College's buildings survive and all are [[listed building]]s.

==Establishment and dissolution==
The College was founded by [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[William Courtenay]] in 1395.<ref name=Hasted>{{cite book |last=Hasted |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Hasted |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53809 |title=The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent |chapter=The town and parish of Maidstone: Churches, religious houses and charities |volume=vol. 4 |year=1798 |accessdate=19 June 2011 |pages=308&ndash;327}}</ref> Courtenay died in 1396 and the College and church were completed by his successor, [[Thomas Arundel]]. [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] endowed the College with land and income from the Hospital of St Peter and St Paul in Maidstone and from the parishes of [[Linton, Kent|Linton]], [[West Farleigh|Farleigh]], [[Sutton, Kent|Sutton]] and [[Crundale, Kent|Crundale]]. The College was also granted the [[advowson]]s for the parishes.<ref name=Page>{{cite book |editor-last=Page|editor-first=William |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=38246 |title=A History of the County of Kent |chapter=The College of Maidstone |volume=vol. 2 |year=1926 |accessdate=19 June 2011 |pages=232&ndash;33}}</ref> To cover the cost of building the College, Courtenay obtained a [[papal bull|bull]] to levy a charge of fourpence in the pound on all ecclesiastical revenue raised in his [[archbishop]]ric.<ref name=Hasted/>{{#tag:ref|In Courtenay's time there were [[Coins of the pound sterling#Pre-decimal coinage|240 pence in the pound]]. The charge was therefore equal to 1.7% of income.|group="note"}}

When the College was closed in 1546 following the passing of the [[Chantry#Abolition of Chantries Acts, 1545 and 1547|Chantries Act]], its annual income was valued at <U+00A3>208 6[[Shilling (British coin)|s]] 2[[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|d]] (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|212.308|1547|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=-1}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).<ref name=Page/>{{Inflation-fn|UK}} The church and the College were separated. The church became the parish church for the whole of Maidstone and the College's estate was granted to [[George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham|George Brooke, Baron Cobham]] but was forfeited to the Crown in 1603 when his grandson, [[Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham|Henry Brooke, the 11th Baron Cobham]], was charged with [[high treason]] for his part in the [[Main Plot]] against [[James I of England|James I]].<ref name=Hasted/> In the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles&nbsp;I]] the College became the property of Sir Edward Henden and later passed into the family of the [[Earl of Romney|Earls of Romney]].<ref name=Hasted/>

The College buildings were used as a farm into the 19th century, until the expansion of Maidstone led to their demolition as the neighbouring area was developed. Part of the site was developed in the late 19th century for the Cutbush Almshouses, a collection of grade II listed buildings.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1266502 |desc=Cutbush Almshouses |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

==Buildings==
The College, like the Church of All Saints, is constructed of Kentish [[rag-stone]] in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular style]]. The main building, a two-storey structure with [[attic]], was mostly built in the 14th century and served originally as the Master's house. Some later 18th century alterations have been made and later windows added. The building contains a collar beam roof and a 16th century staircase, moulded ceiling and [[aumbry]] cupboard.<ref name=college>{{NHLE |num=1225072 |desc=The College |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> 
[[File:College Road, Maidstone, 1866.jpg|thumb|left|College farm, 1866. The ruined gateway is in the left foreground with the Master's Tower, College Gateway and tower of All Saints Church in the background. The [[oast house]] on the left has been demolished.]]
The College Gateway to the north of the site is a three-storey rectangular tower with stone-ribbed [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] archway through it. The roof is [[hip roof|hipped]], projecting above a [[crenellation|crenellated]] parapet. A small turret is located in the south-west corner. Adjacent to the tower on the west side is a two-storey building that contained the College [[refectory]], kitchen and [[scullery (room)|scullery]] on the ground floor with a dormitory and infirmary on the first floor. On the north-west corner of this building is a small three-storey tower known as the River Tower or [[Muniment]] Tower.<ref name=gateway>{{NHLE |num=1336234 |desc=The College Gateway (All Saints Parish Room) The College Tower |accessdate=26 June 2011}}</ref> The two-storey Master's Tower was the original access to the College from the river. a single storey structure is attached to the south side.<ref name=tower>{{NHLE |num=1086312 |desc=The Master's Tower |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> The ruined gateway stands to the south separated from the other structures by the almshouses. It consists of a pointed arch for carriages in a roughly coursed rag-stone wall flanked by buttress walls on each side.<ref name=ruin>{{NHLE |num=1336235 |desc=The Ruined Gateway |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

The Gateway and refectory are listed Grade I,<ref name=gateway/> the Master's house is listed Grade II* and the Master's Tower and the ruined gatehouse are listed Grade II.<ref name=college/><ref name=tower/><ref name=ruin/> The College site is also a [[Scheduled monument]] with the protection covering the ruined gateway and buried remains of demolished buildings.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1011029 |desc=The College of All Saints |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>
