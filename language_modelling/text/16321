{{Campaignbox Byzantine<U+2013>Seljuk War}}
The '''Byzantine<U+2013>Seljuq Wars''' were a series of decisive battles that shifted the balance of power in [[Asia Minor]] and [[Syria]] from the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]]. Riding from the [[steppe]]s of [[Central Asia]], the Seljuq Turks replicated tactics practiced by the [[Huns]] hundreds of years earlier against a similar Roman opponent but now combining it with new-found Islamic zeal; in many ways, the Seljuq Turks resumed the conquests of the Muslims in the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Arab Wars]] initiated by the [[Rashidun]], [[Umayyad]] and [[Abbassid|Abassid]] Caliphate in the [[Levant]], [[North Africa]] and Asia Minor.

Today, the [[Battle of Manzikert]] is widely seen as the moment when the Byzantines lost the war against the Turks; however the [[Byzantine military]] was of questionable quality before 1071 with regular Turkish incursions overrunning the failing [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|theme system]]. Even after Manzikert, Byzantine rule over Asia Minor did not end immediately, nor were any heavy concessions levied by the Turks on their opponents <U+2013> it took another 20 years before the Turks were in control of the entire Anatolian peninsula and not for long either.

During the course of the war, the Seljuq Turks and their allies attacked the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] of Egypt, capturing Jerusalem and catalyzing the call for the [[First Crusade]]. Crusader assistance to the Byzantine Empire was mixed with treachery and looting, although substantial gains were made in the [[First Crusade]]. Within a hundred years of Manzikert, the Byzantines had (with Crusader assistance) successfully driven back the Turks from the coasts of Asia Minor and extended their influence right down to Palestine and even Egypt. Later, the Byzantines were unable to extract any more assistance, and the [[Fourth Crusade]] even led to the sack of [[Constantinople]]. Before the conflict petered out, the Seljuqs managed to take more territory from the weakened [[Empire of Nicaea]] until the Sultanate itself was taken over by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], leading to the rise of the [[Ghazw|ghazis]] and the conclusive [[Byzantine<U+2013>Ottoman wars]].

The wars' distant origins lay in the formation of the Byzantine Empire from the collapsing Roman Empire in the 4th century. Prior to the formation of the Byzantine realm in the 3rd century AD, the [[Roman Empire]] faced a severe military and political crisis; political assassinations and dangerous campaigning led to 32 Emperors seizing and losing power within 50 years of Roman history.<ref>{{cite web| title =Table of the Emperors| publisher =About.com| year =2007| url =http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chaosemp_table.htm| accessdate =2007-11-03}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}} Matters were made worse with an [[economic]] and [[demographic]] problem.

Unlike the Western Half of the Roman Empire, the Eastern Half experienced fewer barbarian invasions although encounters with the [[Huns]] and [[Persia]]ns kept the Byzantines busy enough from making any serious recovery attempts in the West.

In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Byzantines experienced several co-ordinated [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|Arab invasions]] losing several vital provinces, such as Egypt and the [[Levant]]. A Byzantine resurgence under the Macedonian Dynasty allowed the Byzantines to reconquer parts of Syria and Mesopotamia; in particular were the efforts of [[Basil II]] who from the late 10th century to early 11th century transformed the Empire into the most powerful state in the Medieval World.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Holmes |first=Catherine |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[De Imperatoribus Romanis]] |title=Basil II (A.D. 976<U+2013>1025) |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilii.htm |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date=1 April 2003 |year= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}</ref>

Despite this, the Byzantines were far from safe. With the death of Basil II came a series of Emperors who failed to secure the Empire against external threats. The biggest threat to the Empire since the Arab invasions were the Turks. The Turks were much like the Byzantines former enemies, the [[Huns]]. Combining their excellent riding skills with Islamic zeal, the Turks who converted to Islam in the 7th and later 8th centuries<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Tiscali encyclopedia |title=Seljuk Empire |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0009478.html |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date= |year=2007 |publisher=Research Machines |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote= }}</ref> were to become a formidable enemy to a Christian state in decline.

As the Byzantines were making headway against the Arabs in the 10th century, Persia was being ruled by the [[Ghaznevid]]s, another [[Turkic people]]. The migration of Seljuq Turks into Persia in the 10th century led to the Ghaznevids being overthrown. There they settled and adopted Persian language and customs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Amir-Moezzi |first=M.A. |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Iranica |title=Shahrbanu |url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_shahrbanu_20050131.html |accessdate=2007-11-03 |edition= |date= |year= |publisher= |volume= |location= |id= |doi= |pages= |quote=... here one might bear in mind that non-Persian dynasties such as the Ghaznevids, Saljuqs and Ilkhanids were rapidly to adopt the Persian language and have their origins traced back to the ancient kings of Persia rather than to Turkish heroes or Muslim saints ... |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015160335/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_shahrbanu_20050131.html |archivedate = 15 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
The Seljuqs established a powerful domain and captured Baghdad in 1055 from the [[Abbasid|Abassid Caliphate]]. The Abassid Caliphate henceforth became a mere figurehead in the Islamic World. The Seljuq Turks, spurred on by their previous success, now launched an attack on the Levant and against Fatimid Egypt, which lost Jerusalem in 1071.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~lilinah/Library/KnowYourTurks.html |title=Know Your Turks! |accessdate=2007-11-03 |last=bint 'abd al-Karim al-hakim al-Fassi |first=Anahita |date=20 November 2000 }}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}}

Encounters between the Seljuq Turks and the Byzantines did not occur until after the reign of Basil II. However, the outcome of another war, the [[Byzantine-Georgian wars]] was in some ways influenced by the incursions of the Seljuk Turks into Georgia,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutgeorgia.ge/history/index.html?page=4 |title=Georgia in the De veloped Feudal Period (XI<U+2013>XIII cen.) |accessdate=2010-02-04 |work=About Georgia}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}}<!-- We might have self reference issue here--> so it is unlikely that they were unheard of.

</ref> Further offensives by the Byzantine army drove the Turks back across the [[Euphrates]].

Despite this, the Seljuq Turks continued their incursions into Asia Minor, capturing Manzikert. The Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes led an army in an attempt to score a decisive blow against the Seljuqs and add some military justification to his rule (which had seen the loss of southern Italy to Norman conquests). During the march, [[Alp Arslan]], the leader of the Seljuq Turks withdrew from Manzikert. His tactical withdrawal allowed his army to ambush the Byzantines, reclaiming Manzikert shortly after.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_manzikert.html|title=Battle of Manzikert, 19 August 1071|accessdate=2007-11-03 |work= |author=Rickard, J.}}</ref> The victory itself led to few gains at the time for the Seljuq Turks, but the civil chaos that resulted in the Byzantine Empire allowed the Seljuqs and various other Turkic allies to swarm into Asia Minor.

After Manzikert, the Seljuq Turks concentrated on their eastern territorial gains which were threatened by the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt although Alp Arslan encouraged other allied Turks and vassals to establish [[Beyliks]] in Asia Minor.<ref>[http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/christian/blchron_xian_crusades01.htm Before of the Crusades <U+2013> 350<U+2013>1095 <U+2013> Timeline of the Crusade: Christianity vs. Islam]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}} Many Byzantines at the time did not see the victory as a total disaster and when the Turks began occupying the countryside in Anatolia they began to garrison the Byzantine cities as well, not as foreign conquerors but as mercenaries requested by various Byzantine factions <U+2013> one Byzantine Emperor even gave the city of Nicaea's defense to the invading Turks in 1078.<ref>{{cite web | title =  The Battle of Manzikert: Military Disaster or Political Failure?| last = Markham| first = Paul| url = http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/markham.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-19| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070513082203/http://www.deremilitari.org/resources/articles/markham.htm <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archivedate = 13 May 2007}}</ref>

The result of the civil war meant that pretenders to the Byzantine throne sought Turkic aid by conceding Byzantine territory. The loss of these cities such as Nicaea and another defeat in Anatolia led to a prolongation of the war. The civil conflict finally ended when [[Alexius I Comnenus]], who had been leading Imperial armies to defeat revolts in Asia Minor became a rebel himself and seized the Byzantine throne in 1081. Despite emergency reforms implemented by [[Alexius I]], [[Antioch]] and [[<U+0130>zmir|Smyrna]] were lost by 1084.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9355511 Antioch <U+2013> Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]</ref> However, between 1078 and 1084 the city had been in the hands of [[Philaretos Brachamios]], an Armenian renegade. By 1091, the few remaining Byzantine towns in Asia Minor inherited by Alexius were lost as well. However, all was not to end in defeat for Byzantium; in 1091, a combined Seljuq/Pecheneg invasion and siege of Constantinople was thoroughly defeated whilst the Norman invasions had been held back as well allowing the Empire to focus her energies against the Turks. The Byzantines were thus able to recover the Aegean islands from [[Tzachas]] and destroy his fleet, and even regain the southern littoral of the [[Marmara Sea]] in 1094.

In 1094, Alexius Comnenus sent a message to Pope Urban II asking for weapons, supplies and skilled troops. At the Council of Clermont in 1095, the Pope preached a [[Crusade]] to be undertaken in order to capture Jerusalem and, in the process, assist the Byzantine Empire which could no longer guard Christendom in the East from Islamic aggression.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2a.html|title=Speech at Clermont 1095 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |work= Medieval Sourcebook|author=Urban II}}</ref> Though the Crusades would assist the Byzantine Empire in reconquering many vital Anatolian towns, it also led to the dissolution of the Empire in 1204 during which time the Byzantines struggled to hold on to their territories.

{{See also|Siege of Nicaea|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Siege of Antioch}}

The first Crusaders arrived in 1096 following Alexius' appeal to the West.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madden|2005|p=35}}.</ref> The agreement between the Byzantines and the Crusaders was that any Byzantine cities re-captured from the Turks would be handed over to the Empire.<ref name="M40">{{Harvnb|Madden|2005|p=40}}.</ref>

This was beneficial for the Crusaders as it meant that they did not have to garrison captured towns and lose troop strength whilst maintaining their supply lines. The Byzantines, in return, would supply the Crusaders with food in a hostile territory and Alexius' troops would act as a reserve to reinforce them in any dangerous situations. The Crusaders first set about attacking [[Siege of Nicaea|Nicaea]] on 6 May 1097.<ref name="M40" /> [[Kilij Arslan I]] was unable to assist the Turks there due to the immense size of the Crusader armies; another small defeat on 16 May<ref name="M40" /> convinced Kilij Arslan to withdraw and abandon the city, which surrendered to the Byzantines on 19 June.<ref name="M40" /> After this, a decisive victory at [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Dorylaeum]]<ref>Rickard, J. (3 April 2001), [http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_dorylaeum.html Battle of Dorylaeum], 1 July 1097.</ref> gave the Crusaders an Asia Minor that was open to attack; [[Sozopolis, Pisidia|Sozopolis]], [[Philomelium]], [[Iconium]], [[Antioch in Pisidia]], [[Konya Province|Heraclea]] and [[Kayseri|Caesarea]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Madden|2005|p=41}}.</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{Harvnb|Mango|2002|pp=185<U+2013>187}}.</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{Harvnb|Parker|2005|pp=48<U+2013>49}}.</ref> all fell to the Crusaders and they even reached as far as Cilicia where they liberated the Armenians from Turkic rule, establishing a supply base.

Unfortunately for Alexius Comnenus, the Byzantines were unable to fully capitalize on these conquests with Caesarea returning to the Seljuqs as a part of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] along with several other cities such as Iconium, the future capital of the Seljuq Turks. However, in a campaign in 1097 [[John Doukas (megas doux)|John Doukas]], the ''megas doux'' (Alexios' brother-in-law), led both land and sea forces which re-established firm Byzantine control of the Aegean coastline and many inland districts of western [[Anatolia]], taking the cities of [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Sardis]], [[Ala<U+015F>ehir|Philadelphia]], [[Laodicea on the Lycus|Laodicea]] and [[Choma (fortress)|Choma]] from the demoralised Turks.<ref>Angold, Michael (1984).

[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|right|A 15th century depiction of the siege of Antioch, with soldiers anachronistically shown wearing plate as opposed to mail armour.]]

Following their victories, the Crusaders went on to [[Siege of Antioch|lay siege to Antioch]] a city under Seljuq occupation. The siege marked the end of Crusader assistance to the Byzantines due to the simulations of [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]]. Kerbogah, a vassal of the Seljuq Turks, had a huge army of 75,000 troops sent to relieve Antioch; his unsuccessful siege of Edessa (a city that had recently fallen to the Crusaders) allowed the Crusaders time to capture Antioch on 3 June 1098,<ref name="M42-43">{{Harvnb|Madden|2005|pp=42<U+2013>43}}.</ref> a day before Kerbogah's arrival. Despite this, Kerbogah's troops were able to breach the citadel<ref name="M42-43" />  where vicious and desperate fighting allowed the Crusaders to repulse his offensive. At this point, one of the Crusaders present, Stephen of Blois deserted and reaching Alexius Comnenus warned him that the Crusaders were destroyed and the [[Byzantine Emperor]] was forced to turn back.<ref>{{Cite document |last=Evans |first=Michael |date=9 November 2001 |title=The Siege of Antioch |publisher=Suite 101 |accessdate=2 June 2007 |url= |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None--> }} <!-- www.suite101.com/article.cfm/crusades/84416 --></ref>

As a result of this apparent desertion of Alexius I, the Crusaders refused to hand back Antioch when they managed to defeat Kerbogah's scattered army.<ref>Rickard, J.

A further Crusade in 1101 to follow up the successes of the First ended in total defeat<ref>Knox, Skip E. "[http://crusades.boisestate.edu/1101/11.shtml Second Battle of Ramleh]." The Crusades. Boise State University. 2 June 2007.</ref> and the consolidation of Seljuq power in Asia Minor with Iconium (modern day Konya) being established as the capital of the Sultanate of Rum.

[[File:JohnIIcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|upright|John II Comnenus, Byzantium's greatest military leader since Basil II. John was able to exploit the weakness of the Turks using the still fragile state and army he had inherited from his [[Alexius I Comnenus|father]]]]

=== John II Comnenus ===

The death of Alexius I brought [[John II Comnenus]] to power. By now, the Seljuq Turks had fractured and became loosely allied to each other.<ref>[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=Seljuk_empire The Seljuk Empire <U+2013> All Empires<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}} During this time the Sultanate of Rum was busy fighting off their former allies, the [[Danishmends]]. John Comnenus was able to use this to his advantage as he undertook a series of campaigns aimed at recapturing Anatolia. Under his rule, the front line was pushed far into Anatolia, reaching dangerously close to his enemies' capital at Iconium. Despite this, the Turks in Anatolia continued to fight each other but a fatal hunting accident to the emperor John robbed the Byzantines of the opportunity to inflict a decisive victory.<ref>Stone, Andrew. "[http://www.roman-emperors.org/johncomn.htm An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors]." 26 Nov 2004. University of Western Australia. 2 June 2007</ref>

=== Manuel Comnenus ===

John II died in 1143 while the Byzantine empire was very powerful. The new emperor, [[Manuel Comnenus]], was unable to extend the front line past his father's achievements. The Seljuq Turks were able to subdue their enemies, the Danishmends under Kilij Arslan II.<ref>"[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Seljuks Seljuks]." Classic Encyclopedia. 1911. ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica''. 2 June 2007.</ref> During this time, the Byzantines were also fighting the Danishmends as nominal allies of the Seljuqs. Part of the agreement meant that captured Danishmend territory would go to the Byzantines. When Kilij Arslan refused, Manuel Comnenus, in 1176, led an impressively large army into Seljuq territory with the intent of taking its capital Iconium. However, the Byzantine force was ambushed in a mountain pass with consequent heavy losses to both sides. This battle, the [[Battle of Myriokephalon]], resulted in the Byzantine campaign of conquest being abandoned.<ref>"[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/2398/oocinfo/history/postmyrio.html&date=2009-10-25+11:27:37 Events After Myriokephalon]."

[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Byzantine territory in red, and the Sultanate of Iconium and Four Emirates in 1180 A.D. Due to the nature of the war and terrain, boundaries were constantly violated by raiding parties on both sides.]]
The battle was tactically indecisive with both leaders keen to seek peace. Following this Manuel's army continued to skirmish with the Turks in Anatolia, defeating them in a smaller but indecisive battle in the Meander Valley. Regardless of this small respite, Myriokephalon had far more decisive implications than the casualties would suggest <U+2013> there was no more reconquest of Asia Minor under Manuel Comnenus after 1176 like that which occurred under his father's reign. For the Seljuqs, the acquisition of Danishmend territory gave them a victory though once again the Seljuqs had to contend with neighbouring disputes leading to the peace treaty as requested by both leaders. By the terms of the treaty, Manuel was obliged to remove the armies and fortifications posted at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum.

However, Manuel Comnenus refused and when Kilij Arslan tried to enforce this treaty, John Vatatzes, who was sent by the Emperor to repel the Turkish invasion scored a victory over the Turks at the [[Battle of Hyelion and Leimocheir]] in the Meander valley; a sign that the Byzantine army remained strong and that the defensive program of western [[Asia Minor]] was still successful.<ref name="JB196">{{Cite book |last=Birkenmeier |first=J.

However, the continuous warfare did have a serious effect upon Manuel's vitality; he declined in health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever. Furthermore, like Manzikert, the balance between the two powers began to gradually shift <U+2013> Manuel never again attacked the Turks and, after his death, they began to move further and further west, deeper into Byzantine territory.

== Byzantine Collapse 1180<U+2013>1308 ==
The death of Manuel I Comnenus in 1180 did not end the Komnenoi dynasty, but Manuel's son proved to be incapable of holding together an empire burdened with heavy expenditure thanks to his father's extensive campaigning. In 1183, Alexius II Comnenus was deposed and replaced by Andronikus II Comnenus. His attempts to continue the militarization of the empire led to his torture, blinding, 3 days of public humiliation and finally death in 1185.<ref name="Norwich294">{{Cite book |last=Norwich |first=John Julius |title=A Short History of Byzantium |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |year=1999 |page=298 |isbn=0-679-77269-3 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> Even the Komnenoi proved fallible <U+2013> Sozopolis, Ankara and Heraclea all fell to K<U+0131>l<U+0131><U+00E7> Arslan II, reaping the benefits of Myriokephalon at long last.

Following this turmoil, the Byzantine Empire was ruled by a [[List of Byzantine Emperors#Angelid dynasty (1185<U+2013>1204)|series of corrupt and/or incapable emperors]] between 1185 and 1204, who failed to guard the frontier. The weak Imperial Byzantine rule led to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Antioch freeing themselves from Byzantine vassal status, the latter doing so in 1180<ref>[http://lexicorient.com/e.o/antioch_crusaders.htm Antioch, Norman Principality of<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the former establishing Prince Leo II on the throne in 1187.<ref>[http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/IV2.html IV/2 Cilician Armenian (1071<U+2013>1375 AD)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Meanwhile, the Crusader states in Palestine began to [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall to Saladin]] resulting in the Third Crusade. This ended in a wasted opportunity for the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire to make substantial gains in the Middle East. The Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos|Isacc II]] further demonstrated his incompetent rule by promising Saladin to keep the Third Crusade from crossing Anatolia (he had little military power to back up this agreement) and when he did allow the Third Crusade to pass due to [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]'s threat, he failed to capitalize on the Crusader sacking of Iconium which had the potential to reverse the defeat at Myriokephalon.

For an empire that was surrounded by enemies the downfall of Byzantium became a greater probability and in 1204 the city of Constantinople was sacked by soldiers of the [[Fourth Crusade]] bringing the Empire into another era of chaos. The Seljuqs of Rum under a new Sultan [[Kaykhusraw I|Kaykhusraw]] exploited this event and attacked the port of [[Antalya]] in 1207 capturing it from the weakened splinter [[Empire of Nicaea]].<ref name="Lowe">{{cite web|title=The Seljuqs of Rum|last=Lowe|first=Steven|coauthors=Baker, Martin|url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm|accessdate=2007-07-09|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Seljuqs.htm&date=2007-07-22+04:56:02|archivedate=22 July 2007}}</ref> The tide turned however in 1210 when the Sultan himself was killed in single combat by the Emperor of Nicaea at the [[Battle of Antioch on the Meander]] and from then on the eastern frontier was more or less stabilized.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madden|2005|p=162}}.</ref> In 1243, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion broke Seljuq power in [[Anatolia]].

=== Byzantine army ===
{{Main|Byzantine army}}
As the below table demonstrates, the population of Byzantium did not fall as a result of Seljuq acquisitions; manpower was still as readily available in 1143 as in 1025. In fact, Western Asia Minor and Greece experienced a population growth on an unprecedented scale, thanks in part due to the trade of the Italian city states of Venice and Genoa and also due to the influx of Greek refugees fleeing the Seljuq Turks.<ref>Whilst some stayed, large numbers of Turk farmers settled in Cappadocia, thus undermining the decaying Thema system</ref> Manuel Komnenos' first expedition to Konya saw the entire Greek population of Philomelion evacuated and settled west. However, the efficiency and resources needed to raise large armies had dwindled somewhat, as can be seen by John and Manuel's failure to create a national army.

Throughout the 10th and 11th centuries, the Byzantine Army was utilized in an increasingly aggressive manner, with new conquests made in the East and the West.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldon|2002|p=48}}.</ref>  As a result, the Theme system which was designed as a defensive military solution to wear down invasions of Asia Minor slowly began to break down. Troops were needed that would maintain a full-time presence on the field, something that the Thematic militia armies drawn from peasant farmers could not do. As a result, the use of ''Tagmata'', full-time professional soldiers became increasingly necessary to wage the offensive warfare that had propelled Byzantium to Great Power status in the 11th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldon|2002|p=49}}.</ref> The Tagamata were also drawn from mercenaries, such as Franks, Normans and no doubt Saxons, Rus and Vikings. The use of Tagamata troops did not directly undermine Byzantine military strength <U+2013> Romanus Diogenes campaigns into Seljuq controlled Mesopotamia was composed of Tagmata as well as Theme troops. Nonetheless, the Theme troops began to seriously decline in quality.<ref>{{Harvnb|Haldon|2002|p=51}}.</ref> [[Michael Attaleiates]] commented at the time of the Manzikert Campaign that the troops of the Theme system were poorly supplied, poorly provisioned and unfit for warfare. Consequently, when the Tagmata army was routed at Manzikert, the Theme system could not stop the relentless advance of the Seljuq Turks and their Turkic allies as they swarmed over Asia Minor, over-running the last Byzantine settlements in 1091. The Tagmata army was not the cause of the failure at Manzikert; however, the reliance on the Tagmata troops was one of the causes that led to the disintegration of the Theme System. As the Turks took Asia Minor, any organized resistance (as demonstrated by Alexius I's pre-Imperial career) had to make-do with an army in a poor condition.

Furthermore, the frontline had moved much closer to Constantinople. Throughout the 12th century, Constantinople held the initiative against Konya, especially so under Manuel's early and middle rule, thanks in part due to his aggressive policies and that of his Father, but when the balance of power shifted to the Turks, losses steadily mounted; soon Western Asia Minor became infiltrated by Turkish ghazis.

=== Crusades ===
{{Main|Crusades}}
Historians continue to debate the effect of the Crusaders on Byzantium. The [[First Crusade]] saw Byzantium make substantial gains in territory although this may have been achieved by the Byzantines themselves; there were plenty of civil conflicts in Asia Minor and amongst the Turks for Alexius to exploit. Furthermore, every other Crusade after the First had a detrimental effect on the Empire with Crusader armies unable to resist raiding towns which were supposed to be their allies<ref>{{Cite document |last=Knox |first=Skip |date=19 June 2007 |title=Second Crusade |work=Crusades |publisher=Boise State University |url=http://crusades.boisestate.edu/2nd/05.shtml |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref> but in Byzantine territory there were quarrels over supplies and a few incidents of fighting. Once again, the westerners had created an unfavorable impression of themselves, and once again the Greeks had made themselves seem untrustworthy. At Constantinople, there were further incidents, even to the point that Conrad threatened to return from the crusade and take the city by force. The Second Crusade saw increased unity amongst the Islamic World,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|p=533}}.</ref> with Zhengi able to bring Damascus into the fold and soon after much of Syria became a united front against the Crusades and a threat to Byzantine interests there. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] even threatened an assault on Constantinople in the [[Third Crusade]] and the [[Fourth Crusade]] saw the sack of Constantinople and substantial loss of territory by the Byzantines to the Frankish Crusaders and the Seljuq Turks.

Long term consequences of the Crusade also includes increased Islamic fanaticism and no more clearly is this seen then in the numerous Beyliks set up in Western Anatolia after 1204, particularly the Beylik of the Ottomans, [[Osman I]]'s domain.<ref>Turnbull, Stephen. The Ottoman Empire 1326<U+2013>1699. New York: Osprey, 2003. pg 17</ref> Later, the Crusades of Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444 designed to aid the Byzantines made Constantinople appear as a magnet for Frankish Knights to launch their zealous attacks <U+2014> this did not help the Byzantines in the long run.

On the other hand, the Crusades allowed Byzantium a chance to regain power in the Mediterranean. Additionally, under Manuel Comnenus, the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Byzantine]] and [[Catholic Church]]es experienced far better relations than in the previous few decades and even coming close to healing the [[Schism (religion)|Schism]]. The alliance with the Pope was also crucial. Together, the Byzantines  and Catholics were able to put on hold the incursions of the Normans in southern Italy who were ravaging Byzantine territory in the Balkans, becoming almost as dangerous a threat as the Seljuq Turks.

It must also be said that long before [[Manzikert]], the Turkic incursions into Asia Minor had begun and Norman Knights were attacking Byzantine cities in southern Italy and the [[Balkans]]. The First Crusade in some aspects gave the Byzantines the tools they needed to utilize the Normans and other Franks as [[mercenaries]], some of whom joined the [[Varangian guard]]. Without the Crusades, the Normans and Turks may have continued their advance even after the defeat of the [[Pecheneg]]s and the [[Normans]] in the Balkans.

=== Seljuq Turks ===
[[File:131 Bataille de Malazgirt.jpg|thumb|right|A 15th-century French depiction of Manzikert (Paris, BnF ms. fr. 226, fol. 256r<ref>http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9009520k/f265</ref>), with no accuracy applied to the weapons, tactics or clothing worn by the combatants.<ref>http://www.allempires.com/empires/seljuk/seljuk_warriors_enh.jpg</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=July 2009}} On the right, Alp Arslan steps on Romanus]]
The war's outcome was determined as much by the weakness of the Byzantines as the strengths of the Seljuqs. Nonetheless, the latter, just like the Arabs many years earlier, failed to destroy the Byzantine Empire. The Seljuq Turks, having originated from the steppes, possessed many advantages. At the Battle of Manzikert, the Byzantine heavy cavalry was defeated using simple hit and run tactics,<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant|first= R G.|title=Battle.  A Visual Journey Through 5000 Years of Combat|location= London|publisher= Dorling Kindersley|year= 2005}}</ref> with the faster light cavalry of the Turks outflanking and outmaneuvering the exhausted cavalry.

Asia Minor was not completely overrun by the Turks after Manzikert but the resulting chaos that followed was easily exploited <U+2013> Turkic soldiers had been used as Mamluks by the Arabs before seizing power themselves <U+2013> the same occurred in Asia Minor, with Byzantine factions inviting Turkic mercenaries to garrison towns. As Imperial rule was re-imposed in Byzantium, these factions, which were secured by Turkic soldiers, became part of the Seljuq Turk domains. Some Greeks fled conquered areas, others stayed to become second-class citizens in an Islamic world (though under Islamic rule were protected provided they paid the ''[[jizya]]'' tax).{{cn|date=October 2012}} More importantly, others converted and were assimilated into the settling population of Turks. Orthodox churches were replaced with Mosques and the crippling Imperial taxes levied by the government and the accompanying Church were lowered.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

=== Conclusion ===

Despite being under Roman rule for almost 1000 years, the Seljuqs rapidly consolidated their holdings over Anatolia.<ref>"[http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_sultanate_of_rum.html Turkey Sultanate of Rum]." www.workmall.com. Jan. 1995. The Library of Congress Studies. 29 May 2007</ref> This allowed them to hold on to their lands and made it all the more difficult for the Byzantines during the [[Komnenian restoration]] to re-conquer.<ref>"[http://www.nndb.com/people/054/000095766/ Manuel I Comnenus]." Soylent Communications. 29 May 2007.</ref> The result was that even when the Byzantine empire was not riddled with civil disputes, it could not defeat the Seljuq Turks, who rarely allowed the Byzantines to engage them, hence the slow campaigning of John Komnenus.<ref>"[http://www.nndb.com/people/849/000101546/ John II Comnenus]." Soylent Communications. 29 May 2007.</ref>

Whenever the Seljuqs did show up in great strength, poor strategy on the part of the Byzantines coupled with good strategy on behalf of the Seljuq ruler resulted in two decisive defeats at Manzikert and Myriokephalon.

The old Roman state was in a constant state of war due to the numerous enemies on its borders; Muslims to the South and East, Slavs to the North and Franks to the West. The  Byzantine Empire  had to face [[Italo-Normans|Normans]], [[Pechenegs]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] within a few decades of each other at a time when the army was torn in civil conflict.

=== Consequences ===
[[File:Aftermath of Manzikert.PNG|left|300px|thumb|Aftermath of Manzikert.]]
The war had great consequences. The Middle East was dominated by the power of the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire; by the end of the 13th century, neither of the two were in a position to project power; the Fatimids having been toppled by the Kurdish influenced [[Ayyubids]], whilst the Byzantines severely weakened by the Seljuqs. Power shifted to the Mamelukes by the 14th century and then back to the Turks in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Never again would a Christian Kingdom yield so much military and political power in the Middle East. As the Turks steadily gained ground in Anatolia, the local population converted to Islam, further reducing any chances of a successful reconquest.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|p=465}}.</ref>

The War also gave Western Christendom the opportunity to launch expeditions/pilgrimages to visit/liberate the Holy Land from Muslim Rule. In time, these Crusaders would establish their own fiefs in the Holy Land, ruling with interests coinciding,  but more often in conflict with, the Byzantine Empire, ultimately leading to a weakening of both the Crusader states and the Byzantine Empire.

For the Turks, it was the beginning of a new era of power. Despite further invasions and attacks by Crusaders from the west and Mongols/Turkic tribes from the east, the Turks slowly emerged as a superpower under the [[Ottomans]].<ref>[http://turkeytravelplanner.com/details/History/Seljuks.html Seljuk Turks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The rise of the Ottomans was parallel to the fall of the Sultanate of Rum and the carving up of the Byzantine Empire. The power vacuum left in Anatolia was easily exploited by one of the Sultanate's nobles, Osman I. Matters were made worse for the Byzantine Empire due to the Latin presence in the [[Peloponnese]] and the rising power of the Bulgarians whom continued to press hard against the borders of Byzantium. In time, the Byzantines would be forced to call on the aid of the Ottomans to head to the European mainland and fight the Bulgarians, giving the Ottoman Turks a firm grip on Europe. The close proximity of Osman's Beylik ensured that confrontation between the Byzantines and the Ottomans would be inevitable. The Byzantines were a match for the Ottomans but events west of Constantinople coupled with civil war and incompetent leadership left the Byzantines reeling from [[Byzantine<U+2013>Ottoman wars|one siege after another]] until [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople fell in 1453]].
