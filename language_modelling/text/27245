The '''flag of Newfoundland and Labrador''' was introduced in 1980, and was designed by Newfoundland artist [[Christopher Pratt]]. The [[flag]] design, with the proportions 2:1, was approved by the [[Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]], on [[May 28]], [[1980]]. It was flown for the first time on [[Holidays in Canada#Provincial and territorial|Discovery Day]]; [[June 24]], [[1980]].

The design was chosen due to its broad symbolism. The blue colour represents the sea, the white colour represents snow and ice of winter, the red colour represents the effort and struggle of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, and the gold colour symbolizes the confidence Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have in themselves and for the future.

The blue triangles are meant as a tribute to the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]], and stand for the British heritage of Newfoundland and Labrador. The two red triangles are meant to represent the two areas of the province &mdash; the mainland and the island. The gold arrow, according to Pratt, points towards a "brighter future"; the arrow becomes a sword, honouring the sacrifices of Newfoundlanders in military service when the flag is draped as a vertical banner. The red triangles and the gold arrow form a trident, symbolizing the province's dependence on its fisheries and the resources of the sea.<ref>[http://www.gov.nl.ca/aboutnl/flag.htm About Newfoundland and Labrador - Provincial Flag]</ref>

==Origins of the flag==
In the late 1970s, the [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] of the province, [[Brian Peckford]], appointed a "Newfoundland and Labrador Flag Committee" to choose a flag to replace the [[Union Flag]] that the province had used as its provinical flag since joining [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. 

The most popular contender for the provincial flag was the ''pink-white-green'' tricolour. Also called, the ''Newfoundland Native Flag'', is the second oldest flag in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] after the Union Flag. Although it appears to be similar to the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]], the Newfoundland tricolour predates the Irish tricolour by five years and is the oldest flag in the world to use the color pink.

The Newfoundland Historic Trust, the Newfoundland Historical Society, and the St. John's Folk Arts Council submitted a joint brief to the Flag Committee of the House of Assembly unanimously recommending the adoption of the tricolour as the flag of Newfoundland. The committee refused to take their advice and instead, the committee chose the Christopher Pratt flag, which was derided by opponents as "the Golden Shaft".

==Newfoundland Tricolour==

{{main|Newfoundland Tricolour}}

A popular but unofficial flag is the Tricolour Flag, sometimes known as the "Pink, White and Green". It is popularly reported to have originated in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] around 1843, and was supposedly created by the [[Roman Catholic]] Bishop of Newfoundland, [[Michael Anthony Fleming]]. There is no documented evidence, however, demonstrating any relation to Bishop Fleming. Having the proportions 2:1 and with each stripe occupying equal thirds of the flag length, the flag is reportedly symbolic of a tradition between local [[Protestants]] (represented by the pink) and [[Catholics]] (represented by the green).

The [[Red Ensign|Red]] and [[Blue Ensign]]s with the great seal in the fly were Newfoundland's unofficial flags from 1904 until 1931.  The Red Ensign was to be flown by commercial shipping while the blue was to be flown by governmental ships.<ref name="fraser">Alistair B. Fraser, [http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Provinces/Newfoundland.html ''Flags of Canada''], 1998.</ref>

Neither ensign was ever formally adopted by the national parliament, but the red ensign gained wide enough use, both at sea and on land, to be considered the unofficial national flag.<ref>[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/facts3.html Newfoundland and Labrador Heraldry and Flags].</ref>  The badge in the flag consists of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the God of Commerce and Merchandise, presenting to [[Britannia]] a fisherman who, in a kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of all the sea. Above the device in a scroll are the words ' Terra Nova ', and below the motto ''Haec Tibi Dona Fero'' or "These gifts I bring thee." The seal was redesigned by Adelaine Lane, niece of [[Governor]] Sir [[Cavendish Boyle]].

==Union Flag==

The old flag of Newfoundland was the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]]. It was adopted in 1931 and used until the suspension of responsible government in 1934. It was readopted as the official provincial flag in 1952, and used until 1980. The Newfoundland and Labrador branch of the [[Royal Canadian Legion]] to this day does not recognize the new Newfoundland flag as the flag of Newfoundland. It contends that during both world wars, Newfoundland soldiers fought under the Union Flag of the dominion. The legion displays the Union Flag at all of its official functions.

==Franco-Terreneuvien flag==
[[Image:Franco-Terreneuviens.svg|thumb|right|150px|Flag of Franco-Terreneuviens]]
The flag of the ''F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador'' is based on the [[Flag of France|French tricolour]] and [[Acadia]]n flag, with three unequal panels of blue, white, and red. Two yellow sails are set on the line between the white and red panels. The sail on top is charged with a spruce twig, while the bottom sail is charged with a pitcher flower. These emblems are outlined in black. 

The sails represent early [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]], [[Brittany|Breton]], and [[France|French]] fishermen that came to the area in 1504. At the same time, they are symbols of action and progress. The yellow is taken from the star of the Acadian flag. The spruce twig is the emblem of Labrador and is also found on the Labrador flag. Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial flower is the insect-eating [[pitcher plant]].

==Labrador flag==

{{main|Flag of Labrador}}
The [[Flag of Labrador|Labrador Flag]] was created by the [[Member of the House of Assembly]] for [[Labrador South]], [[Mike Martin (Canadian politician)| Mike Martin]] in 1974. Martin did so as an affront of political mischief aimed at [[Joey Smallwood]] and his indifference to [[Labrador]]. As Martin is from [[Cartwright]], the town now proclaims itself the "Birthplace of the Labrador Flag". The flag was presented to Labrador community councils, and to the Labrador members of the House of Assembly, in April 1974.

==Nunatsiavut flag==

The self-governing [[Inuit]] region of [[Nunatsiavut]] has its own flag: The flag of Nunatsiavut is the flag adopted by the Labrador Inuit Association to represent the Inuit of Labrador and their new Land Claims Settlement Area called Nunatsiavut. The flag features the traditional Inuit [[Inukshuk]] coloured white, blue, and green echoing the flag of Labrador.
