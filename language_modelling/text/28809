'''Alyssa Jean Healy''' (born 24 March 1990 on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]]) is a cricketer who plays for [[New South Wales Breakers|New South Wales]] and the [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australian women's team]]. She made her international debut in February 2010.<ref name=prof>{{cite web

A right-handed [[batsman]] and [[wicket-keeper]], she is the daughter of [[Greg Healy (cricketer)|Greg Healy]], who played one [[first-class cricket|first-class match]], while her uncle [[Ian Healy]] was Australia's [[Test cricket|Test]] wicket-keeper and held the world record for the most Test dismissals. Healy first came to prominence in late 2006 when she became the first girl to play among boys in the private schools' competition in New South Wales. She moved up the state age group ranks and made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 2007&ndash;08 season. She played most of her first two seasons as a specialist batsman due to the presence of [[Leonie Coleman]]&mdash;a wicket-keeper for Australia&mdash;in the state side. Coleman left New South Wales at the start of the 2009&ndash;10 season and Healy took up the glovework on a full-time basis for her state. During the same season, she recorded her highest score of 89 [[not out]] as [[run rate|faster than a run a ball]], and made the most dismissals of any wicket-keeper in the [[Women's National Cricket League]]. 

Following the injury to Australian captain and wicket-keeper [[Jodie Fields]], Healy was given her international debut in the 2010 Rose Bowl series against [[New Zealand national women's cricket team|New Zealand]]. She played in the first five [[One Day Internationals]] (ODIs) and five [[Twenty20]] (T20) internationals, but was dropped for the last three ODIs during the New Zealand leg of the series.

== Early years ==
Healy is the daughter of [[Greg Healy (cricketer)|Greg Healy]], who played one [[first-class cricket|first-class match]] while her uncle, [[Ian Healy]], was Australia's [[Test cricket|Test]] wicket-keeper from the late 1980s until 1999 and was the world record holder for the most Test dismissals.<Ref name=prof/> Despite the family heritage, and watching her uncle represent Australia, she said that she did not become interested in cricket until she moved from [[Queensland]] to [[Sydney]] as a child and was coaxed into taking up the sport by a friend.<Ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/whats-in-a-name-for-healy/story-e6frey50-1111115184225 |title= Alyssa Healy leads NSW to triumph over Queensland |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Phelps, James |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref>

Her selection at the age of 16 in late 2006 as [[wicket-keeper]] for [[Barker College]] [[11 (number)#In sports|First XI]], the first time a girl had been picked to play among boys in the elite private schools' cricket competition in [[New South Wales]], drew press commentary from various sources. This came about after an anonymous person, believed to be a former male student, circulated an email entitled "Save Barker Cricket Now" in the school community attacking the selection as a "disgrace" and calling for gender segregation of the cricket team.<Ref name=nc/> The sportsmaster of Barker College condemned the anonymous writer as "gutless" and maintained that Healy's selection was based on merit.<ref name=nc/> Ian Healy and [[Alex Blackwell]], a cricketer for the Australian women's team and former Barker student, also defended the selection and criticised the email author. The emailer was also criticised, and Alyssa Healy commended, by social commentators in newspapers.<ref name=nc>{{cite web

== Senior domestic debut ==

At the start of the 2007&ndash;08 season, she made her senior debut for the [[New South Wales Breakers]] in the Australian domestic one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the [[batting order (cricket)|top-order]], as [[Leonie Coleman]], a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against [[South Australian Scorpions|South Australia]] and was unsuccessful to being with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five [[innings]]. After one month at senior level, she broke through with a match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After [[Queensland Fire|Queensland]] had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 [[over (cricket)|overs]], with 18 overs remaining. She raised the [[run rate]], scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight [[four (cricket)|fours]], shepherding the [[batting order (cricket)|tail-enders]] and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.<Ref name=o/><ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Women v Queensland Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/130/130213.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

New South Wales reached the final and were awarded the title because they placed first in the qualifying matches after rain washed out the deciding game.<Ref name=o/><ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Women v Queensland Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/130/130223.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> Healy ended the season with 78 runs at 11.14.<Ref name=o/> She also played in two [[Twenty20]] interstate matches. She scored two and made a [[stumping]] in the first match, and neither batted nor kept wicket in the latter. New South Wales prevailed in both.<Ref name=o/>

At the end of the season, she was selected for the Under-23 Australian team to play a series against the senior [[England women's cricket team|England]] and Australian teams. She scored 45, 1 and 41 not out in three matches. In the third match, she combined for a second-wicket [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 52 with [[Elyse Villani]], hitting six boundaries in 62 balls and guiding her team to an eight-wicket win over the Australian team.<ref name=o/><ref>{{cite web|title=Australia Under-21s Women v Australia Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/129/129769.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> Playing as a specialist batsman, she also took three catches.<Ref name=o/> The new 2008&ndash;09 season started the same way, with the Under-23 national team playing against Australia and [[India national women's cricket team|India]]. The first match, against India, was washed out and Healy made a [[Duck  (cricket)|duck]] [zero] and 9 in the other matches. Playing as a batsman, she did not take a catch.<ref name=o/> 

Healy again played as a batsman, with Coleman ensconced behind the stumps. In the first four matches of the new domestic season, she batted only once, scoring nine. In these matches she was placed in the lower-order and did not bowl. She was dropped after these four matches.<Ref name=o>{{cite web| title=Player Oracle AJ Healy |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=187174&opponentmatch=exact&playername=Meckiff&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>

She then played six matches for the Second XI in the space of a week, mostly as a top-order batsman, sometimes opening and as a wicket-keeper. New South Wales won all the fixtures except for one that was abandoned due to inclement weather.<ref name=o/> She scored 120 runs at 40.00, took six catches and made three stumpings, and was recalled to the senior team after one week in the second-string outfit.<Ref name=o/> In her first three matches back, Healy was placed in the middle-order and not required to bat or keep wickets.<Ref name=o/> In the last league match, she scored 59 from 55 balls in a 89-run partnership at faster than a run a ball with [[Lisa Sthalekar]] against [[Victorian Spirit|Victoria]].

Healy also played in two [[Twenty20]] matches for her state during the season, scoring 35 from 27 balls against South Australia and 16 from 21 balls against Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Australia Women v New South Wales Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/180/180653.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Women v Victoria Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/180/180657.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> She was New South Wales' second top-scorer in both matches; the first was won but the second lost.<Ref name=o/>

After the Women's World Cup held in early 2009, Coleman transferred to play for the [[ACT Meteors|Australian Capital Territory]], so Healy became New South Wales' gloveman on a full-time basis for the start of the 2009&ndash;10 season. After making scores of 11, 12 and 29 in her first three innings of the one-day season,<ref name=o/> she struck an unbeaten 89 against Victoria. Coming in upon the fall of [[Leah Poulton]] with the score at 1/9 after three overs, she hit 13 fours in 82 balls, putting on partnerships of 72 with Blackwell and 82 with Sthalekar. New South Wales reached their target of 187 with more than 13 overs to spare and Healy was named the Player of the Match, having earlier taken a [[Caught|catch]] and made a stumping.<ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Women v Victoria Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/256/256144.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> Her season was interrupted by her selection in the Australian Under-21 team to play against the New Zealand Emerging Players. In five matches, she scored 50 runs at 10.00, took five catches and made one stumping as Australia won the series 4&ndash;1.<ref name=o/>

In the final of the one-day competition, she scored 23 from 37 balls batting at No. 3 and took two catches as New South Wales defeated Victoria by 59 runs.<ref>{{cite web|title=New South Wales Women v Victoria Women |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/256/256162.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref> Healy ended her first full season as a wicket-keeper with 208 runs at 29.71, the second-highest average in her team behind Blackwell. In 11 matches, she also took 11 catches and completed 9 stumpings, effecting more dismissals than any other player.<ref>{{cite web|title=Batting and fielding in Women's National Cricket League 2009/10 (ordered by average) |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Womens_National_Cricket_League_2009-10/Batting_by_Average.html |accessdate=2010-03-10 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}</ref>
 
She made 52 runs at 13.00 in seven T20 matches.<Ref name=o/> Her best score was an unbeaten 20 from 13 balls in an eight-wicket win over [[Tasmanian Roar|Tasmania]]. In the final, Victoria batted first and made 5/127, Healy completing a catch and stumping.

Healy was selected in the Australian squad for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand in February 2010 due to an injury to the incumbent wicketkeeper and captain [[Jodie Fields]]. The selection committee released a statement saying "Alyssa has been identified for higher honours for a number of years and now gets the chance to display her wicket-keeping skills and attacking batting on the international stage".<ref>{{cite web

In her first match, she scored 21 from 11 balls in the death overs, hitting four fours as Australia made 241 before bowling out the visitors for 126 to seal a 115-run win. She took one catch, removing [[Amy Satterthwaite]] from the bowling of [[Rene Farrell]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Australia Women v New Zealand Women |accessdate=2010-03-10 |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/256/256124.html|publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> Healy made consecutive ducks in the next two matches, and made four in the final match at [[Junction Oval]]. She had only brief opportunities with the bat in the closing stages of the innings.

She then played in the three T20s held at [[Bellerive Oval]] in [[Hobart]]. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] men teams, and was the first match to be shown live on free-to-air television in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian [[fast bowler]] [[Ellyse Perry]] extracted an outside edge from captain [[Aimee Watkins]] from the first ball of the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it.<Ref name=drop/><Ref name=td/> Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch [[Nicola Browne]] from Sthalekar's [[off spin]]. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 at the end of the 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final ball of the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant [[fielding (cricket)|first slip area]]. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper [[Rachel Priest]] diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.<Ref name=o/><ref name=drop>{{cite web |title=Devine intervention gets New Zealand home |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2010-03-10 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/449359.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref><ref name=td>{{cite web |title=Australia Women v New Zealand Women |accessdate=2010-03-10 |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/428068.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref>
