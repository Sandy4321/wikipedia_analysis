The '''Madagascan sunset moth''' or simply '''sunset moth''', '''''Chrysiridia rhipheus''''', is a day-flying [[moth]] of the [[Uraniidae]] family. It is considered to be one of the most impressive and beautiful [[Lepidoptera]].<ref name =Tait/> Famous worldwide, it is featured in most [[coffee table book]]s on the Lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors.<ref name =Smith/><ref name =Griveaud/> It is very colourful, though the [[iridescence|iridescent]] parts of the [[Insect wing|wings]] do not have pigment; rather the colours originate from [[optical interference]].<ref name =Yoshioka/><ref name=Prum/> Adult moths have a wingspan of <span style="white-space:nowrap;">7<U+2013>9 centimetres</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(3<U+2013>3<U+00BD> in)</span>.

The moth was considered to be a [[butterfly]] by [[Dru Drury]], who described it in 1773 and placed it in the genus ''[[Papilio]]''. [[Jacob H<U+00FC>bner]] placed it in the moth genus ''Chrysiridia'' in 1823. Later redescriptions led to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonyms]] such as ''Chrysiridia madagascariensis'' ([[Ren<U+00E9>-Primev<U+00E8>re Lesson|Lesson]], 1831).<ref name =Kirby/> 

At first the moth was thought to be from China or [[Bengal]],<ref name=Drury/><ref name=Boisduval/> but was later found to be [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]]. It is found throughout the year in most parts of the island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of ''[[Omphalea]] spp.'' The [[caterpillar]]s are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black [[setae]]. [[Silk]] spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold onto smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four [[instar]]s, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The [[pupa]]l stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.<ref name=Catala/>
''Chrysiridia rhipheus'' is the sole [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist]] herbivore of the four species of ''Omphalea'' in Madagascar. ''Omphalea'' is toxic: the toxins are [[sequestering#Biology|sequestered]] by the feeding caterpillar and retained in the pupal and adult stages.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> Thousands of these moths [[Insect migration|migrate]] between the eastern and western ranges of their host plants.<ref name=Catala/><ref name =LeesDavidSmith/>

==Taxonomy==
The Madagascan sunset moth was first described by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of [[Hammersmith]]. Because of its resemblance to [[Swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail butterflies]], Drury described the species as ''[[Papilio]] rhipheus''.<ref name =Paul/>{{ref|etymology|1}} The specimen Drury received had the head of a different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]<ref name =Swainson>{{cite book |last=Swainson |first=William S. |authorlink=William John Swainson |others=Vol III.

Once the inaccuracy in Drury<U+2019>s specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus ''Urania'', until 1823 when the German entomologist [[Jacob H<U+00FC>bner]] placed it in a new genus, ''Chrysiridia''. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, [[William John Swainson|William Swainson]] thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly ''Rhipheus dasycephalus'' and the moth ''Leilus orientalis''.<ref name =Swainson/> Other synonyms include ''U. crameri'' by Maassen in 1879 and ''U. ripheus'' var.

The genus ''Chrysiridia'' is entirely African and the only other species in the genus is the [[East Africa]]n ''[[Chrysiridia croesus|C. croesus]]''. ''Chrysiridia'' is one of three [[Diurnality|diurnal]] [[Uraniinae|uraniine]] genera. The other two genera are ''Urania'', its [[Cladistics#Cladograms|sister taxon]], and ''Alcides'', the most [[basal (phylogeny)|basal]]. In the group, the use of ''[[Endospermum]]'' is an ancestral state (a plesiomorphy). The more basal ''Alcides'' feeds on ''Endospermum'' and ''[[Omphalea]]'', while ''Urania'' and ''Chrysiridia'' feed only on ''[[Omphalea]]''.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/>

==Description==
''Chrysiridia rhipheus'' has a wingspan of {{nowrap|7<U+2013>9 centimetres}} {{nowrap|(3<U+2013>3<U+00BD> in)}}, and sometimes up to {{nowrap|11 centimetres}} {{nowrap|(4 in)}}. Moths from the highlands, {{nowrap|900<U+2013>1080 metres}} {{nowrap|(3000<U+2013>3500 ft)}}, have a median wingspan of 7&nbsp;centimetres (3&nbsp;in); moths from lower altitudes, 600&nbsp;metres (2000&nbsp;ft), have a median wingspan of 9&nbsp;centimetres (3<U+00BD>&nbsp;in).<ref name=Catala/> Like many other [[Uraniinae|uraniine moths]], the sunset moth has an uncanny resemblance to [[Swallowtail butterfly|swallowtail butterflies]], especially in its tails and colourful wings, and can easily be mistaken for a butterfly.<ref name = Klots>{{cite book |last=Klots |first=Alexander Barrett |coauthors=Elsie Broughton Klots |title=Living Insects of the World |origyear=1959 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=odFFGQAACAAJ&dq=swallowtail+Chrysiridia |accessdate=2008-02-19 |date=2007-05-25 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]}}</ref> 

The sunset moth is black with iridescent red, blue and green markings. There is a fringe of white scales on the wing edges, wider on the hindwings.

====Wing microstructure====
Unlike in many other moths, the colour of C. rhipheus's wings does not come from [[Pigment (biology)|pigments]]. The colour originates from [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] scattering and interference of light by the microstructure of the ribbon-like [[scale (zoology)|scales]] covering the moth's wings.<ref name =Yoshioka/><ref name=Prum/> These structural characteristics make this species and its [[neotropical]] relative ''Urania'' common subjects of research in [[Optics|optical science]].<ref name=Prum>{{cite journal |last=Prum |first=Richard O. |coauthors =Quinn, Tim; Torres, Rodolfo H. |date=January 31, 2006 |title=Anatomically diverse butterfly scales all produce structural colours by coherent scattering |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=209 |pages=748<U+2013>765 |publisher=The Company Of Biologists |location=Cambridge |doi=10.1242/jeb.02051 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/209/4/748.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-02-16 |pmid=16449568 |issue=Pt 4}}</ref>

The colours on the Madagascan sunset moth's wings are produced by the conjunction of two optical phenomena:
#An air-[[cuticle]] multilayer in the scales creates optical interference. Each scale contains cuticle layers with randomly located blocks of cuticle that hold them in place and maintain an air gap between them. The layers and air gaps are narrower than the [[wavelength]] of visible light. The structure varies from one layer at the [[proximal]] end of each scale, to about six layers at the [[distal]] end. This multilayer structure strongly reflects certain [[wavelength]]s of light, which are determined by the thicknesses of the layers and the angle at which the light hits the scale.
#The scales are highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This mechanism is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal part of each scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90<U+00B0> angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from [[surface normal|normal incidence]], the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes near the top of the curved part of the scale. 
The colour seen in each part of the wing is the combination of the colours reflected by these two effects. 

Because the cuticle layers are arranged in rows, with a cylindrical curve, the amount of the second type of reflection is dependent on the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many [[insects]] can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths.<ref name =Yoshioka/> This has not yet been studied, however.

==Distribution and habitat==
Drury<U+2019>s specimen was given to him by Captain May of Hammersmith and believed to have come from [[China]].<ref name=Drury/> Cramer believed the specimen came from [[Chandannagar|Chandernagore]] in [[Bengal]], however, giving rise to the French name "page de Chadernagor".<ref name=Boisduval>{{cite book |last=Boisduval |first=Jean Alphonse |authorlink=Jean Baptiste Boisduval |coauthors =Achille Gu<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>e |title=Histoire naturelle des insectes: sp<U+00E9>cies g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral des l<U+00E9>pidopt<U+00E8>res |url=http://books.google.com/?id=4zIqu2erQ9kC&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22Chandernagor%22+%22urania%22+%22rhipheus%22 |accessdate=2008-06-19 |publisher=Roret |language=French |page=12 |year=1857 }}</ref> It is now known that ''Chrysiridia rhipheus'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]]. Thousands of adult moths seasonally [[Insect migration|migrate]] between geographically isolated populations of their host plant ''Omphalea'' spp. They can be found almost everywhere on the island, except in the south-west and the extreme subdesertic south of the [[Androy]] where their host plant is absent. They migrate from the three species in the dry deciduous forest in the west (''O. ankaranensis'', ''O. occidentalis'' and ''O. palmata'') to the eastern rainforest species (''O. oppositifolia''). The western species are largely in [[protected area]]s. The eastern species, on the other hand, is mostly unprotected and dispersed in widely scattered populations threatened by [[deforestation]]. Being the only [[evergreen]] species, ''O. oppositifolia'' is probably crucial for the moth<U+2019>s survival. The Jamaican moth ''[[Urania sloanus]]'', from the same subfamily (Uraniinae), most likely became [[Extinction|extinct]] after the loss of one of its host plant species.<ref name=Catala/><ref name =LeesDavidSmith/>

The moths migrate in response to changes in the host plants. ''Chrysiridia'' larvae defoliate the whole plant, and even eat the flowers and fruit, and thus have a considerable negative impact on the reproduction and survival of seedlings.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> The plants probably [[Plant defense against herbivory|react]] by changing their nutrient and [[secondary compound]] levels, becoming toxic to the larvae and causing high mortality. ''Omphalea'' populations that are not damaged by moths for long periods of time have lower toxicity.<ref name =Smith/> These factors cause mass increases in local population, followed by sudden crashes. The population crashes might result from increased larval mortality, but are more likely caused by the emigration of the adult moths. Through [[semiochemical]]s, the plant may recruit [[hymenoptera]]n [[parasitoid]]s as a protection, hence playing a role in the [[population dynamics]] of the moth.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/>

===Host plants===
[[Image:Omphalea distribution Madagascar.svg|thumb|150px|Distribution of the four species of ''[[Omphalea]]'' in Madagascar.]]
Like ''C. croesus'' and species of the genus ''Urania'', ''C. rhipheus'' is a [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist species]] whose caterpillars feed strictly on species of the pantropical genus ''[[Omphalea]]'' ([[Euphorbiaceae]]).<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> Four species of the genus ''Omphalea'' are endemic to Madagascar:
*''O. ankaranensis'', a [[shrub]] from the limestone [[Karst topography|karst]] of northern Madagascar
*''O. palmata'', a [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry forest]] shrub, closely related to ''O. ankaranensis'', but from western Madagascar
*''O. occidentalis'', also a dry forest species of western Madagascar
*''O. oppositifolia'', a [[tree]] from the east coast [[rainforest]] of Madagascar<ref name= Gillespie>{{cite journal |last=Gillespie |first=Lynn J. |year=1997 |title= ''Omphalea'' (Euphorbiaceae) in Madagascar: A New Species and a New Combination |journal=Novon |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages =127<U+2013>136 |publisher= Missouri Botanical Garden |location=St. Louis |laysummary=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1055-3177(199722)7:2%3C127:O(IMAN%3E2.0.CO;2-9 |laysource=JSTOR |doi= 10.2307/3392184 |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3392184}}</ref>

''Omphalea'', like many other members of the Euphorbiaceae, possesses [[Extrafloral nectaries|leaf nectaries]] that attract [[Polistinae|polistine wasps]], which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also attract [[ant]]s. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore ''Chrysiridia'' caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. The species from the genus contain polyhydroxy [[alkaloid]]s potentially [[sequestering#Biology|sequestered]] or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kite |first=G. C. |coauthors = Fellows, L. E.; Lees, D. C.; Kitchen, D.; Monteith, G.

==Behaviour==
Unlike most moths, the sunset moth is [[diurnal animal|day flying]] and the bright [[Aposematism|aposematic]] colours warn predators of its [[toxic]]ity, a strategy seen in many diurnal moths.
Another habit the moth has in common with many butterflies is the night resting posture<U+2014>the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith>{{cite journal |last=Lees |first=David |coauthors =Smith, Neal |year=1991 |title= Foodplants of the Uraniinae (Uraniidae) and their Systematic, Evolutionary and Ecological Significance |journal=The Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=296<U+2013>347 |publisher= The Lepidopterists' Society |url=http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/pdfs/1990s/1991/1991-45(4)296-Lees.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-10-29 |laysummary=http://research.yale.edu/peabody/jls/htms/1990s/1991-45(4)296-Lees.htm}}</ref> The moth flies over the [[Crown (botany)|crown]] of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100&nbsp;m (300&nbsp;ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.<ref name=Catala/>

===Life cycle===
Continuous generations of the moth are present all year. The highest populations are found from March to August, while the lowest are from October to December.<ref name=Catala/>
The females [[Oviposition|lay their eggs]] late in the afternoon or at nightfall, and locate potential oviposition sites visually.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> Like the eggs of other Uraniidae, the sunset moth<U+2019>s eggs are domed with projecting ribs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Minet |first=J. |year=1986 |title=<U+00C9>bauche d'une classification moderne de l'ordre des L<U+00E9>pidopt<U+00E8>res |journal=Alexanor |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=291<U+2013>313 }}</ref> A single egg weighs about {{convert|1|mg|oz|lk=on}} and usually has 17 ribs, but sometimes 18 or less often 16. The eggs are usually laid on the lower surface of ''Omphalea'' leaves, but occasionally on the upper surface. Eggs are laid in groups of 60 to 110, usually about 80.<ref name=Catala/>

After they hatch, the small caterpillars only eat the tissue ([[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]]) between the [[Veinlets|veins]] of the leaves. They do this to avoid the sticky and toxic [[latex]] produced by the plant's [[laticifer]]s and transported in the veins. After 3<U+2013>4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, [[tendril]]s, [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands at the base of the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of [[Insect mouthparts|mouthpart]] coagulation.<ref name=Catala/><ref name =LeesDavidSmith/> The caterpillars spin [[silk]] from their mouth with an <U+2018><U+221E><U+2019> motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm [[season]] to two and a half to three months in the cold season.<ref name=Catala/> The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black [[setae]].<ref name=CarterButterflies/> It has five pairs of [[proleg]]s on [[Caterpillar#Anatomy|segments]] 3 to 6 and 10, and six [[Arthropod leg|true legs]] attached to the [[thorax]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Common |first=I.

After completing all but its last [[Ecdysis|moult]], the caterpillar spins a [[Pupa#cocoon|cocoon]] out of [[silk]]. The cocoon can be in the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh.<ref name=Catala/><ref name=CarterButterflies/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/fr/index.php?section=portrait_description&intParent=4&idInsecte=7 |title=''Chrysiridia rhipheus'' |accessdate=2006-10-29 |date=2005-05-10 |work=Collection naturalis<U+00E9>e
|publisher=[[Montreal Insectarium|Insectarium de Montr<U+00E9>al]] |language=French}}</ref> In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the [[metamorphosis]] takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The [[Chrysalis|chrysalis]] stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before [[Eclosion#Emergence|eclosion]], the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal [[exuvia]] (the pupal [[exoskeleton]]), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping [[haemolymph]] into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.<ref name=Catala/>

===Nectar sources===
Adult moths prefer white or whitish-yellow flowers as a nectar source, which indicates that visual cues play a large role in their selection. Most flowers visited are [[inflorescence]]s of small flowers or have dense filaments, giving them the appearance of a bottle brush, often because of the conspicuous projecting [[stamen]]s as in many [[Leguminosae]] ([[Mimosoideae]], [[Myrtaceae]] and [[Combretaceae]]). However, not all white flowers elicit a response: the white and showy flowers of ''Omphalea oppositifolia'' are not visited by the adult moths. Nectar sources include the flowers of:
*''[[Terminalia catappa]]'' (Indian almond)
*''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' (tea plant)
*''[[Eriobotrya japonica]]'' (loquat)
*[[Eucalyptus|''Eucalyptus'' spp.]], especially ''E. saligna''
*''[[Cussonia]] vantsilana''
*''[[Mangifera]] indica'' (a mango tree)
All these flowers are white, with the exception of ''Camellia sinensis'' which has a yellow centre, and all either have dense filaments or are formed of tight clusters of small flowers.<ref name =LeesDavidSmith/>
