'''''Aliens''''' is a 1986 [[science fiction film|science fiction]]/[[action film]] starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Michael Biehn]], [[Lance Henriksen]], and  [[Bill Paxton]]. A sequel to the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''Aliens'' is set fifty-seven years after the first film and is regarded by many film critics as a benchmark for the action and science fiction genres.<ref name=action>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20042607_24,00.html|title=The 25 Greatest Action Films Ever!|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|last=Bernardin|first=Marc|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref><ref name=scifi>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/features/special/2007/scifi/?r=10&mid=1000617|title=100 Best-Reviewed Sci-Fi Movies|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> In ''Aliens'', Weaver's character [[Ellen Ripley]] returns to the planet where she first encountered the hostile [[Alien (fictional creature)|Alien]]; this time she is accompanied by a unit of [[United States Colonial Marines|Colonial Marines]].

It won in the categories of [[Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing|Sound Effects Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Visual Effects|Visual Effects]]. Given the combat-oriented nature of the film, Aliens was promoted with the tagline, ''"This Time It's War."'' The film's success led to the sequels ''[[Alien 3]]'' (1992) and ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997).

== Plot ==
<!--Per Wikipedia Guidelines, please do not expand this summary any further!-->  
[[Ellen Ripley]], the only survivor of the space freighter ''[[Nostromo (spaceship)|Nostromo]]'', is rescued and revived after drifting for fifty-seven years in [[Stasis (fiction)|hypersleep]]. Interviewed before a panel of executives from her employer the [[Weyland-Yutani|Weyland-Yutani Corporation]], Ripley's testimony regarding the [[Alien (fictional creature)|Alien]] is met with extreme skepticism, as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the ''Nostromo''. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her "questionable judgment" in destroying the ''Nostromo'' and learns that [[LV-426]], the [[planetoid]] where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a [[terraforming]] colony. Ripley is  visited by Weyland-Yutani employee Carter J. Burke, who informs her that contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426. The company is dispatching Burke and a unit of [[USCM|US Colonial Marines]] to investigate, and offers to restore Ripley's flight status if she will accompany them as a consultant. Psychologically traumatized by her experience onboard the ''Nostromo'', Ripley initially refuses to join, but accepts when she realizes the mission will allow her to face her fears. Arriving in orbit of LV-426 aboard the warship ''[[Sulaco (spaceship)|Sulaco]]'', she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, including Lieutenant Gorman, Sergeant Apone and the [[android]] [[Bishop (Alien)|Bishop]].

The heavily-armed expedition descends to the planetoid's surface via [[dropship]], where they find the colony seemingly abandoned. The only living things found are two Alien "[[facehuggers]]" on display in the colony's medical lab and a severely traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The Marines locate the colonists, who are clustered in the colony's nuclear-powered atmosphere processing station. Traveling to the station, the Marines find a large Alien nest filled with the [[cocoon]]ed corpses of the colonists. When the Marines destroy a [[chestburster]], a swarm of Aliens awaken and kill most of the unit. Ripley rescues Corporal Hicks and Privates Vasquez and Hudson. With Gorman temporarily unconscious, Hicks assumes command and orders the [[dropship]] to recover the survivors, intending to return to the ''Sulaco'' and destroy the colony from orbit. A stowaway Alien kills the [[dropship]] pilots in flight, causing the vessel to crash into the processing station. The surviving humans barricade themselves inside the colony complex.

After learning that Burke has ordered Bishop to preserve Alien specimens for return to the company labs, Ripley becomes suspicious of Burke's intentions. She discovers that he ordered the unprepared colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the ''Nostromo'' crew first encountered the Alien eggs and threatens to expose him. Bishop declares that the damaged processing station has become unstable and will detonate with the force of a [[thermonuclear weapon]]. He volunteers to crawl down a service pipe to the colony transmitter and pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface via remote control. Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the Medical Laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers released from their tanks. Ripley is able to alert the Marines, who rescue her and Newt from the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of attempting to use her and Newt as hosts to smuggle implanted Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine procedures and of planning to kill the rest of the Marines in hypersleep during the return trip. Hicks is ready to execute Burke when the electricity is suddenly cut off. The Aliens enter through the ceiling and attack ''[[en masse]]'', killing Hudson and Burke. The rest of the group escapes into the air ducts, where Gorman and an injured Vasquez, cut off and surrounded, sacrifice themselves by detonating a [[grenade]]. The force of the blast knocks Newt down a shaft, where she is captured by an Alien.

[[Image:Anguish.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|The Alien queen in the atmosphere processor hive.]]
Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop and the second dropship, but Ripley is unwilling to leave Newt behind. She rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen and her egg chamber. Ripley destroys most of the eggs, enraging the queen who escapes by tearing free from her [[ovipositor]]. Closely pursued by the queen, Ripley, Newt, Bishop, and Hicks escape on the dropship moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast. Back on the ''Sulaco'', Ripley and Bishop's relief at their narrow escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, tears Bishop in half. Ripley battles the queen using an [[Powered exoskeleton|exosuit]] cargo-loader. The two of them tumble into a large [[airlock]], which Ripley then opens, expelling the queen into space. Ripley clambers to safety, and she, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for the return back to Earth.

== Production ==
=== Origins and inspiration===
While completing pre-production of ''[[The Terminator]]'' in 1983, director [[James Cameron]] discussed the possibility of working on a sequel to ''[[Alien]]'' (1979) with [[Twentieth Century Fox]] producer David Giler.<ref name=schickel/> A fan of the original, Cameron was interested in crafting a sequel and entered a self-imposed seclusion to brainstorm a concept for ''Alien II''.<ref name=schickel/> After four days, Cameron produced an initial forty-five page treatment, although management changes at Twentieth Century Fox resulted with the film put on hiatus as they felt ''Alien'' did not create a compelling profit to warrant a sequel.<ref name=schickel/> A scheduling conflict with actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] caused filming of ''The Terminator'' to be delayed by nine months as Schwarzenegger was filming ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'', which allowed Cameron to write a script for ''Aliens''. While filming ''The Terminator'', Cameron wrote ninety pages for ''Aliens'' and although the script was not finished, Fox were impressed and told him if ''The Terminator'' was a success he would direct ''Aliens''.<ref name="57 years">''57 Years Later - Continuing the story, Superior Firepower''</ref>

Following the success of ''The Terminator'', Cameron and partner Gale Anne Hurd were given approval to direct and produce the sequel to ''Alien'', scheduled for a 1986 release. Cameron was enticed by the opportunity to create a new world and opted to not remake ''Alien'', but create a worthy combat sequel focusing "more on terror, less on horror".<ref name="Audio com"/> [[Sigourney Weaver]] who played [[Ellen Ripley]] in ''Alien'' had doubts about the project, although after meeting Cameron she was interested in revisiting her character. Fox refused to sign a contract with Weaver over a payment dispute and asked Cameron to write a story excluding Ellen Ripley.<ref name="57 years"/> He refused as Fox had told him she had signed on when he began writing the script. With Cameron's persistence, Fox signed the contract and Weaver obtained a salary of $1 million, thirty times her fee for the first film.<ref name=corliss>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961869,00.html|title=The Years of Living Splendidly|date=1986-07-28|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|last=Corliss|first=Richard|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref>

Cameron drew inspiration for the ''Aliens'' story from the [[Vietnam War]], with regards to situations where a technologically superior force was mired in a hostile foreign environment, "Their training and technology are inappropriate for the specifics, and that can be seen as analogous to the inability of superior American firepower to conquer the unseen enemy in Vietnam: a lot of firepower and very little wisdom, and it didn't work."<ref name=schickel>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961839,00.html|title=Help! They're Back!|date=1986-07-28|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|last=Schickel|first=Richard|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref> The Colonial Marines were hired to protect the business interests of the company, to go with a myth that it was the reason troops were sent to South Vietnam. The attitude of the Marines was influenced by the Vietnam War. They were portrayed as cocky thinking they would win, although when pitched against a less technological advanced enemy that is more determined, the outcome will differ.<ref name="Audio com"/>

===Concept and design===
[[Image:Ah1gm35.jpg|thumb|right|The [[AH-1 Cobra]] used in Vietnam served as inspiration for the design of the dropship]]
Early concept art was created by [[Syd Mead]] who had worked on ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'' and ''[[Tron (film)|Tron]]''. The original design of the spaceship, the ''Sulaco'' was problematic due to its horizontal design which caused difficulties with the aspect ratio, as much of the ship would be out of frame. Cameron showed Syd his own concept art and the final result was a "rocket gun that carries stuff". Concept artists were asked to include subliminal acknowledgments to the Vietnam War, which included designing the [[dropship]] as a combination of a [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[AH-1 Cobra]].<ref name="concept">''Building Better Worlds - From concept to construction, Superior Firepower''</ref>

Some scenes inside the Alien nest were shot inside a decommissioned [[power plant]] in [[Acton, London]]. The crew thought it was a perfect place to film as the walkways were grilled and the number  of corridors. Problems were encountered with rust and [[asbestos]], however, and the crew was required to spend money to clean the asbestos.<ref name="concept"/> The Alien nest set was not dismantled after filming and was unused until 1989 when <!-- will remove repetition of was used later-->it was used as the Axis Chemicals set for ''[[Batman (film)|Batman]]''. When the crew of ''Batman'' entered the set, they found most of it intact.<ref name="Movie Minutiae: Aliens">{{cite web|title=Movie Minutiae: ''Aliens''|author=Kemble, Gary|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|date=[[2005-12-02]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200511/s1513926.htm|accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>

[[Image:Aliens (film) APC.jpg|thumb|left|The APC (armored personal carrier) was designed using an aircraft towing vehicle.]]
[[British Airways]] was re-equipping several of its aircraft towing vehicles, and the crew managed to purchase an old one to use it as the APC (armored personal carrier). It weighed 70&nbsp;tons, and although the crew removed 35&nbsp;tonnes of lead, the power station floor was reinforced to support the weight. The crew found using junk helpful in set design, which included Ripley's toilet, which came from a [[Boeing 747]], using lockers, helicopter engines and vending machines in the opening hypersleep scene. Production designer Peter Lamont was asked to reduce the cost of several scenes which included the not-yet filmed hyper sleep sequence. Gale Hurd opted to cut it although Lamont and Cameron felt it was important. Instead of hydraulic chambers, wires and puppeteers were implemented and a mirror was used to give the illusion there were twelve hyper sleep tubes, although there were four.<ref name="concept"/>

===Casting===
Cameron opted to hire actors who had, or could create, American accents. Over 3,000 residents in the United Kingdom auditioned, although many were rejected. After auditions of UK residents proved unsuccessful, the crew imported actors from America including [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Bill Paxton]], [[Michael Biehn]], who all worked with Cameron on ''The Terminator''. Casting staff found the role of Newt the most difficult. They auditioned children at schools; many had acted in commercials and would smile after their lines, something the producers did not want due to the tone of the film. [[Carrie Henn]], whose father was stationed at a United States military base, was picked out of 500 children for the role of Newt,<ref name="Audio com"/> having no acting experience.<ref name="casting">''Preparing for Battle - Casting and characterization, Superior Firepower''</ref>

Actors who played Marines were asked to read Heinlein's ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' and then to undergo military training which included running, weights, how to salute, march, deployment, and manoeuvre for two weeks. [[Al Matthews]] who plays Sergeant Apone had experience in the military and believed he was cast because of this experience. Cameron wanted the Marines to train together to bond so it would show on-screen. Sigourney Weaver, [[William Hope]] (Lt. William Gorman), and [[Paul Reiser]] (Carter Burke), were absent due to other obligations, although Cameron found it better suited as they are outsiders in the film. The actors were asked to personalize their armor by adding pictures and writing messages to make each unique. Michael Biehn was brought into ''Aliens'' one week after filming had commenced and was unable to participate in the training.<ref name="casting"/>

===Filming===
[[Image:Gale Ann Hurd and James Cameron.jpg|160px|thumb|right|The producing team behind ''Aliens'', James Cameron and Gale Ann Hurd.]]
''Aliens'' was filmed on a budget of $18 million at [[Pinewood Studios]], with production lasting ten months.<ref name=schickel/> Production was affected by a number of personnel and cast disruptions. Shooting was said to be problematic due to cultural clashes between Cameron and the British crew, with the crew having what actor [[Bill Paxton]] called a "really indentured" way of working. Cameron, who is known to be a hard driving director and at the time was bound to a low budget with a release date set that he could not delay, found it difficult to adjust to working practices such as the regular "tea breaks" and "lucky dips" that brought production to a temporary halt. The crew were admirers of [[Ridley Scott]], and many believed Cameron to be too young and inexperienced to be directing such a film as ''Aliens'', despite Cameron's attempts to show them his previous film, ''The Terminator'', which had not yet been released in the UK.<ref name="war">''This Time It's War - Pinewood Studios, 1985, Superior Firepower''</ref>

At one point, the crew members mocked Cameron's then wife, producer Gale Anne Hurd, by asking her who the producer was and insisted she was only getting producer's credit because she was Cameron's wife. A walkout occurred when Cameron clashed with an uncooperative cameraman who refused to light a scene the way Cameron wanted. Specifically, the cameraman believed in creative input onset lighting and had lit the alien nest set brightly, while Cameron insisted on his original vision of a dark, foreboding alien nest, relying on the lights on the Marines armor. After the cameraman was fired, Hurd managed to coax the crew members into coming back to work.<ref name="war"/>

=== Weapons and props ===
[[Image:PulseRifle.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|The pulse rifle was created using a Thompson SMG and the fore end of a shotgun]]
The weapons used by the Marines are based on real, fully functional weapons. British armorers used guns they found to be the most reliable when firing blanks and those which looked futuristic. The [[M41A pulse rifle]] was created from a [[Thompson submachine gun|Thompson SMG]] with an attached fore end of a [[Spas 12|Franchi SPAS-12]] shotgun and a Remington 12 Gauge Model 870P receiver with barrel. The [[M56 Smart Gun]]s carried by Vasquez and Drake are based on the German [[MG-42]] machine gun and are maneuvered with a [[steadicam]] harness, which was created using old motorcycle parts. The crew found flamethrowers the most difficult weapon to create and use, as it was the most dangerous and heaviest.<ref name="actionweps">The Risk Always Lives - Weapons and action, ''Superior Firepower''</ref>

=== Music ===
Music composer [[James Horner]] felt he was not given enough time to create a [[musical score]]. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to be locked so he could write the score in six weeks, which he thought was a sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor [[Ray Lovejoy]] was barely keeping up with the workload, due to time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was so pre-occupied with sound effects, in which Cameron spent two days with the person who created the sound for the pulse rifles, that he was given an outdated recording studio. Recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], the establishment was 30&nbsp;years old and was barely able to patch in [[synthesizer]]s and use electronic equipment required by Horner for this type of film.<ref name="JH">The Final Countdown <U+2013> Music, editing and sound, ''Superior Firepower''</ref>

Six weeks from theatrical release, no [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] had taken place, and the score had not been written as Horner was unable to view the completed film. The final [[cue]] where Ripley battles the Alien queen was written overnight. Cameron completely reworked the scene leaving Horner to re-write the music. As Gale Hurd did not have much music production experience, she and Cameron denied Horner's request to push the film back four weeks so he could finish the musical score. He felt that if he was given more time he could get it 100% right, rather than his opinion of what was 80%. The score was recorded in roughly four days.<ref name="JH"/> Despite his troubles, Horner did manage to receive an Academy Award nomination (his first) for Best Original Score. 

Horner stated tensions between himself and Cameron were so high during post-production that he assumed they would never work together again. Horner believed the film schedules that Cameron wanted to make were too short and stressful. The two parted ways until 1997 when Cameron, so impressed with Horner's score for ''[[Braveheart]]'', asked him to compose the score for ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.<ref name="JH"/>

===Visual effects===
Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak were hired to supervise the visual effects having previously worked with Cameron on several [[Roger Corman]] movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426 using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide.<ref name="Visual effects"/> Filming the miniatures was difficult due to the weather; the wind would blow over the props, although it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures.<ref name="Visual effects"/>

The Alien suits were made more flexible to expand on their movements, such as crawling and jumping, to make them more of a character. Dancers and stunt men were in these suits which were made more durable than in ''Alien'' to allow these movements. The Alien's design was changed as the crew thought the original domehead would crack due to excessive mobility, whereas in ''Alien'' the Alien was limited in its movements.<ref name="Visual effects"/>

Scenes involving the Alien queen were the most difficult to film according to production staff. A life-size [[mock-up]] was created in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the real Alien queen. Standing at fourteen feet, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and sixteen were required to move it. All sequences involving the queen were filmed in-camera with no digital rod removal.<ref name="Visual effects">''The Power of Real Tech - Visual effects, Superior Firepower''</ref>

== Special edition ==
''Aliens: Special Edition'' was released in 1992 on [[laserdisc]] and [[VHS]] that restored 17&nbsp;minutes of deleted footage. These additions include a segment showing the colony on LV-426 when the colonists first encounter the ''[[Derelict (Alien)|Derelict]]'' Alien spacecraft which is infested with Alien eggs, a sentry gun scene in the operations building, Ripley's discovery of her daughter's fate while she was in hypersleep, and several dialogue scenes between Ripley and the Marines.<ref name="Audio com"/> These scenes were deleted from the theatrical edition as 20th Century Fox representatives thought the film was showing "too much nothing" and spent an unnecessary amount of time building suspense. It was therefore cut so it would have the maximum amount of screenings in cinemas.<ref name="Audio com">Aliens: Special Edition audio commentary</ref>

The special edition was released on ''[[The Alien Legacy]]'' in 1999 on DVD. The special edition and theatrical editions were released in the 2003 ''[[Alien Quadrilogy]]'' DVD box set, and a 2-disc Special Collector's Edition DVD was released on [[January 6]], [[2004]].<ref name="Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)">{{cite web|title=''Aliens'' (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)|publisher=Amazon.com|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXAE/ref=pd_cp_d_0?pf_rd_p=316286001&pf_rd_s=center-41&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B00000ILDE&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0SH4J243Z3NWZ008JHPH
