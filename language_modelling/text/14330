== Background ==
The Speak & Spell was created by a small team of engineers led by Paul Breedlove, himself an engineer, with [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) during the late 1970s. Development began in 1976 with an initial budget of $25,000, as an outgrowth of [[Texas Instruments|TI]]'s research into [[speech synthesis]].<ref>''[http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/timeline/eps/1970/docs/78-speak-spell_introduced.htm Speak & Spell introduced <U+2013> first commercial use of DSP technology]''. [[Texas Instruments]]. Retrieved 17 December 2008.</ref> The completed proof version of the first console utilized TI's trademarked Solid State Speech technology to store full words in a [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] format similar to the manner in which calculators of the time stored numbers. Additionally purchased cartridges (called expansion modules) could be inserted behind the battery receptacle to provide new solid state libraries and new games.<ref name=game/> This represented the first time an [[educational toy]] utilized speech that was not recorded on tape or phonograph record (as with [[Mattel]]'s [[See 'n Say]] line or the earlier [[Chatty Cathy]] dolls).<ref name=OrigPR/>

== The Speak & Spell console ==
=== The original Speak & Spell ===
The original Speak & Spell was the first of a three-part talking [[educational toy]] series that also included [[Speak & Read]] and [[Speak & Math]]. This series was a subset of TI's Learning Center product group and the Speak & Spell was released simultaneously with the [[Spelling B (toy)|Spelling B]] (a non-speech product designed to help children learn to spell), and the [[First Watch (toy)|First Watch]] (designed to teach children to read digital and analog timepieces).<ref name=OrigPR/> The Speak & Spell was sold, with regional variations, in the [[United States]],<ref name=OrigPR/> [[Canada]], [[Australia]], in [[Europe]],<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_78UK.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (English Voice Type 1)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 14 July 2005.</ref> and [[Japan]].<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_78JP.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (Japan)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 1 September 2005</ref>

The toy was originally advertised as a tool for helping young children to learn to spell and pronounce over 200 commonly misspelled words.<ref name=OrigPR/> It shipped as a bundle with only the basic cartridge called ''Basic Unit'' (containing the minigames, ''Mystery Word'', ''Secret Code'', and ''Letter''.)<ref name=abledata>''[http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=113582&orgid=110707&discontinuetoggle=1 Texas Instruments]''. Abledata. Retrieved 17 December 2008.</ref>

=== Later Speak & Spell models ===
Between its release and 1983, the Speak & Spell was redesigned twice under the name Speak & Spell. It was completely recreated in 1982 as the Speak & Spell Compact (a version lacking a visual display), and in 1989 the Super Speak & Spell was released to replace the original [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD) with a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). Between 1989 and 1992 the Super Speak & Spell would see three redesigns as well. The 1992 Super Speak & Spell would mark the last release of the series.

Regional variations with different speech libraries and different games<ref name=game/> were released in at least 9 countries with seven language variations. Because the linguistic aspect of the games<ref name=game/> played on the Speak & Spell are of central importance to Speak & Spell titles, separate cartridge libraries were developed for [[English language|English]] (including [[American English|American]] and [[British English|British]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] markets.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Album_Speech.htm Texas Instruments Speech Products]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 13 January 2001.</ref> Beyond the natural disinclination of consumers to purchase games<ref name=game/> in foreign languages, however, [[regional lockout]] does not prevent the use of expansion module cartridges in consoles for which they were not designed. Since the layout of foreign editions is nearly identical (the only major differences being graphics, color, and placement of power/headset jacks), and the cartridges lacked a lockout, cartridges often bore instructions in multiple languages despite their designation for consumer groups that might not understand the language.<ref name=adpic1>Woerner, Joerg.''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_LaDictee_Lib.htm#Les%20Mots%20De%20Base Additional Pictures <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 23 December 2007.</ref>

In 1980, the original Speak & Spell was redesigned to give it a [[membrane keyboard]] in place of raised buttons.<ref name=gregory>Gregory, Chris and Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_80.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (Type 2)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 25 January 2002.</ref> This version was nearly identical to the first release and with [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] cartridge recognition common to all Speak & Spells except the first version of the Super Speak & Spell, the entire library of cartridges from the original release were available to the 1980 release. Outside of the United States, the 1980 release was marketed in the United Kingdom under the same name,<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_80UK.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (English Voice Type 2)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 13 July 2005.</ref> in German as the Buddy<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/Buddy.htm Texas Instruments Buddy]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> (employing an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in place of the Speak & Spell's [[apostrophe]]), and in French as La Dict<U+00E9>e Magique<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LaDictee.htm Texas Instruments La Dict<U+00E9>e Magique]'' Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> (lit. The Magical Dictation).

In 1982, the Speak & Spell Compact was released at about half the size of the Speak & Spell and lacking the [[vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] video component.<ref>Bohlig, Dirk and Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_Compact.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell Compact]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> The Speak & Spell Compact was a [[dedicated console]] and only one other version, the Speak & Write<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknWrite.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Write]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> was released for [[English language|English]] markets. Speak & Spell Compact sales were very poor in the United States, causing TI to send much of its excess stock abroad. UK Marketing Manager Martin Finn had the product retitled for the UK, and all existing units were recolored blue and repackaged.

In 1983, the Speak & Spell was again redesigned. The change was even more minute, however, representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics. This version was marketed first in Italian as Grillo Parlante<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/GrilloParlante.htm Texas Instruments Grillo Parlante]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> (lit. [[the Talking Cricket]] as the character of the book for children [[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]), and then later in the United States<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_86.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (Type 3)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> and the United Kingdom<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknSpell_86UK.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Spell (English Voice Type 3)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 3 December 2007.</ref> as the Speak & Spell, and in France as the Dict<U+00E9>e Magique<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LaDictee_1986.htm Texas Instruments La Dict<U+00E9>e Magique (Type 2)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 28 October 2008.</ref> again.

The Super Speak & Spell was released in 1989 with a number of major changes. The display screen was changed to an LCD screen instead of the former VFD screen. The keyboard layout was also altered to match the standard [[QWERTY]] keyboard rather than the [[Alphabet|ABC]] keyboard.<ref name=SSnS>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SuperSpeaknSpell.htm Texas Instruments Super Speak & Spell]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> The general structure of the console was also altered so that the handle which had come at the top of the screen in prior Speak & Spells was now found on the bottom of the toy and [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] features were added to the shape. Furthermore, game<ref name=game/> cartridges for the Super Speak & Spell were changed so that they were incompatible with prior Speak & Spells and the cartridge slot was similarly altered to prevent backward compatibility.<ref name=adpic2>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_SuperSpeaknSpell_Lib.htm#Expansion1 Additional Pictures <nowiki>[2]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 23 December 2007.</ref>

The following year the Super Speak & Spell was again majorly redesigned to return to a considerable degree to its prior Speak & Spell form. This version re-adopted the handle-on-top look of the previous models and resumed use of the original cartridges.<ref name=adpic3>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_LaSuperDictee_Lib.htm#Anglais%201 Additional Pictures <nowiki>[3]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 23 December 2007.</ref> The use of the LCD screen and the QWERTY keyboard were retained, however the keyboard gained an additional 5 letters (6 in some regions) to correspond with letters requiring [[diacritic]]s. It was marketed first in Spanish as El Loro Parlanch<U+00ED>n<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/ElLoroParlanchin.htm El Loro Parlanch<U+00ED>n]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 6 May 2007.</ref> (''The Chatty Parrot''), and then later in the United States<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SuperSpeaknSpell91.htm Texas Instruments Super Speak & Spell (91)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> as the Super Speak & Spell, in French as La Super Dict<U+00E9>e Magique,<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LaSuperDictee.htm Texas Instruments La Super Dict<U+00E9>e Magique]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 16 March 2004</ref> and in Italian as Grillo Parlante Pi<U+00F9><ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/GrilloParlantePiu.htm Texas Instruments Grillo Parlante Pi<U+00F9>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 6 May 2007.</ref> (lit. Speaking Cricket Plus).

In 1992, a third redesign of the Super Speak & Spell was made for the Spanish market only. The new version was nearly identical to the prior El Loro Parlanch<U+00ED>n save for the name which became El Loro {{sic|hide=y|Profesor}}<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/ElLoroProf.htm Texas Instruments El Loro Profesor]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 25 September 2002.</ref> (''Professor Parrot'').

== Electronics ==
The Speak & Spell used the first single-chip voice synthesizer, the TMC0280, later called the TI [[TMS5100]], which utilized a 10th-order [[linear predictive coding]] (LPC) model by using pipelined electronic [[Digital signal processing|DSP]] logic.<ref>History Channel, ''Modern Marvels: "70s Tech"'', 2007, aired 6:00<U+2013>7:00pm MST</ref>  A variant of this chip with a very similar voice would eventually be utilized in certain [[Chrysler]] vehicles in the 1980s as the [[Electronic Voice Alert]].

Speech synthesis data ([[phoneme|phoneme data]]) for the spoken words were stored on a pair of 128 Kbit metal gate PMOS ROMs. 128 Kbit was, at the time the largest capacity ROM in the late 1970s. Additional memory module cartridges could be interchangeably plugged into a slot in the battery compartment and selected via a button on the keyboard.  The technique used to create the words was to have a professional speaker speak the words.  The utterances were captured and processed using a mini-computer.  Finally the data were hand edited to fix any voicing errors while reducing the data rate to an optimal level.  The stored data were for the specific words and phrases used in the Speak & Spell.  The data rate was about 1,000 bits per second.

The video-display employed in the Speak & Spell was a [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (VFD). The later Super Speak & Spell model, had a much slimmer case and an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen rather than a VFD screen.

The unit could use either 4 "C" batteries or 6 volt [[Direct current|DC]] power adapter with positive tip polarity.

== Cartridges ==
Cartridges (also known as expansion modules) are freely exchangeable [[ROM cartridge|ROM libraries]] that provide additional content without providing additional functionality. These cartridges are plugged into a slot near the battery compartment in order to introduce new software libraries. Word and game lists are of differing lengths depending upon the cartridge and the word lists in models marketed for different languages reflect the language marketed for. Separate word lists also exist for regional variants such as the American and British English versions.
The word list used in each of the regional models reflects the recommendations of educators in each country. The English, French, German and Italian versions were all created by a team of non-specialists, in TI's plant near Antibes, France, under the watchful eye of Larry Brantingham who had patented the underlying technology.

Examples of educational games<ref name=game/> that could be played using Speak & Spell cartridges include:
*''Say It'' - The classic word-spelling game wherein the player must spell ten words after hearing them "spoken" by the unit. The ''E.T. Fantasy Module'' [[tie-in]] (due to the toy's notable appearance in the movie ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'') asked players to spell such words as "[[geranium]]", "universe", and "creature".
*''Mystery Word'' - An electronic version of [[Hangman (game)|hangman]]
*''Secret Code'' - A code-generating program in which the player enters a word on the Speak & Spell and the console returns the word in code.
*''Letter'' - Another algorithm that allows the player to change a word he has entered by shifting its letters several spaces down the alphabet.
*''Drop It'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which the player will see how new words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''Memory'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which letter recognition and visual memory skills are tested.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''Mystery'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which letter patterns in words and visual memory are developed.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''Mix Up'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which word patterns and the relationships between letter sounds and spelling are tested.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''Same As'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which [[homophones]] are tested.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''A.C.E.'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which abbreviations, contractions, and word endings are tested.<ref name=SSnS/>
*''Race'' - A Super Speak & Spell game in which fast recall, accurate spelling, and touch-typing skills are tested with time limits.<ref name=SSnS/>

The "Secret Code" mini-game would encrypt or decrypt "words" (really, any string of up to 8 letters) by matching up two sets of the alphabet, slightly askew. In the game P and Q match up and run in opposite directions:

: <code>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</code>
: <code>F E D C B A Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G</code>

== Home computer adaptions ==
Several commercial retailers offered hardware and software which allowed home computers to inferface with the Speak & Spell's hardware and access its capabilities.<ref>Digherra, Larry. ''[http://members.tripod.com/werdav/speakell.html Talk Can Be Cheap]''. [[Popular Electronics#Computers & Electronics|Computers & Electronics]]. February 1983.</ref>

Percom Data Company offered a PC Card called "Speak-2-Me-2" which installed into the battery compartment of the Speak & Spell, and connected via cable to a [[TRS-80]].

East Coast Micro Products offered hardware to interface [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]-based computers such as the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Apple IIe]] with the Speak & Spell. A program called "S.peek.uP" was marketed which could control this hardware.

The February 1983 issue of [[Popular Electronics#Computers & Electronics|Computers & Electronics]] contained instructions for interfacing a Speak & Spell with a [[Sinclair ZX80|Sinclair ZX-80]] a [[Sinclair ZX81|Sinclair ZX-81]], or a [[Timex Sinclair 1000|Timex 1000]].

Texas Instruments itself later adapted the Speak & Spell's technology into a speech synthesizer accessory for its popular [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]] computer.<ref>''[http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/history/history.html A Brief History of the TI-99]''. [[Texas Instruments]]. Retrieved 18 December 2008.</ref>

=== Emulation ===
A number of emulations (really simulations, as they don't run the original code) of the Speak & Spell have shown up online in recent years with varying degrees of functionality. Often programmed for [[Adobe Flash|Flash]],<ref>Hill, Alice. ''[http://www.realtechnews.com/posts/6139 Speak & Spell Online Emulator]''. RealTechNews. Retrieved 18 December 2008.</ref> these emulations often are the result of [[Nostalgia|nostalgic sentiment]] for the 1980s. No true emulator of the Speak & Spell, running the original code, yet exists.

Examples of emulators generally available online include:
*SASS - A fully functional non-Flash [[executable]] emulator created by Mike Green in 1999<ref>Green, Mike.

== Legacy ==
=== In commercial music ===
[[Image:Hexstatic Listen&Learn albumcover.jpg|thumb|right|A modified Speak & Spell graces the cover of the [[Hexstatic]] album, ''[[Listen & Learn]]''.]]
The Speak & Spell has been employed in recent years in commercial music as an instrument either in its original form or as a modified [[Circuit bending|"bent" circuit]] instrument (see below). Artists like French electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]], have used the musical samples from the Speak & Spell's opening sequence in their songs<ref>[[Jean Michel Jarre|Jarre, Jean Michel]]. "Touch to Remember." ''[[T<U+00E9>o & T<U+00E9>a]]''. 26 March 2007.</ref> Artists in various other (typically electronic) genres have employed the non-musical vocal portions of the Speak & Spell to create vocal parts in their songs. Thus, Speak-&-Spell-generated speech synthesis has featured in [[Alternative music]] (with artists such as [[Beck]],<ref>Beck. [[The Information]]. 03-10-2006.</ref> [[Coldplay]]<ref>Coldplay.

=== Circuit bending ===
{{Main|Circuit bending}}
Some [[musician]]s have also used modified "[[Circuit bending|circuit bent]]" Speak & Spell units in their compositions. By opening the Speak & Spell's case, cross-wiring [[terminal (electronics)|terminals]], and installing electronic components such as [[switch]]es and [[potentiometers]], amateur hobbyists purposely disrupt normal functioning of the Speak & Spell's [[Keyboard matrix (music)|membrane keyboard matrix circuit]] in order to create new sounds. These modifications act to overwhelm the unit's [[Keyboard technology#Keyboard switch matrix|keyboard switch matrix]] to produce an effect known in the field of electronics as [[Rollover (key)#Key jamming and ghosting|key jamming or ghosting]]. This effect can be triggered in the Speak & Spell without making modifications if more than 3 keys in the same row are depressed simultaneously however, within the circuit bending culture, emphasis is given to the fact that these units are being used as instruments and thus externally manipulable components are often accentuated. Great attention may be given to enhancing the visual aesthetics of the units by adding decorations and repainting "bent" Speak & Spells, and these units have been traded and sold online and within the circuit bender community.

Examples of artists who have used circuit bent Speak & Spells in their compositions include [[Beck]],<ref>[[Beck]]. ''[[The Information]]''. 3 October 2006.</ref> [[CocoRosie]],<ref>[[CocoRosie]]. "Animals." ''[[The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn]]''. 10 April 2007.</ref> [[Eisbrecher]],<ref>[[Eisbrecher]].

=== Notable appearances in other media ===
'''Museums and displays'''<br/>
The Speak & Spell features in various electronics museums such as the [[Computer History Museum]]<ref name=handheld/> and the [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian National Museum of American History]]<ref name=cartridges/> due to its seminal influence in the field of modern [[speech synthesis]]. The Speak & Spell is also featured in the [[Game On (exhibition)|Game On exhibition]] as an example of a [[handheld video game]].<ref>''[http://www.slq.qld.gov.au/whats-on/exhibit/cur/game-on Playable Games]''. [[Game On (exhibition)|Game On]]. 17 November 2008 <U+2013> 15 February 2009.</ref>

'''Film'''<br/>
[[Image:ET Communicator Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A 1978-model Speak & Spell features prominently as the "phone home" in 1982's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (note the raised buttons).]]
The Speak & Spell has shown up numerous times in various [[television show]]s, films, and game shows. Perhaps most notably, a Speak & Spell has a prominent role as a key component of the alien creature's homebuilt interstellar communicator in the [[Steven Spielberg]] motion picture ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.

Speak & Spells also make appearances in movies such as Disney's ''[[Toy Story]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' (where the game device is a character named "Mr. Spell"), ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' (where the possessed doll, [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] plays with one while imprisoned in a crib), in ''[[Poltergeist III]]'' (used by the character Carol Anne Freeling) and ''[[Fortress (1993 film)|Fortress]]'' (where the director Paul threatens the intelligent supercomputer Zed-10 who made a mistake that it would be lucky if it ends up as the Speak & Spell). The Speak & Spell has also shown up several times on internet Flash cartoons such as ''[[Homestar Runner]]'' (where a robot is constructed from a box of [[Grape-Nuts]] and a Speak & Spell).

'''Music videos'''<br/>
The Speak & Spell appears prominently in [[Owl City]]'s music video "[[Fireflies (song)|Fireflies]]", where it spells the lyrics when the correspondent lyrics are said.

'''Television'''<br/>
The Speak & Spell also appears in [[The Penguins of Madagascar]] television series on [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] under the ownership of the [[penguins]]. They use it as a voice synthesizer, although it didn't have really the ability to say words.

'''Other'''<br/>
[[Dane Cook]] had a Speak & Spell joke, stating he had an evil one as a child (ABCDEFG I will kill your family). There is a Speak & Spell character in the [[The Annoying Orange|Annoying Orange]] called Spell & Speak. In the April 5, 2012 episode of The Big Bang Theory, the lead character, Dr. Sheldon Cooper, explains how he had used "Speak and Spell" to dress up like Prof. Hawking for a Halloween night.

== Variants ==
=== Speak & Read line ===
{{Main|Speak & Read}}
The [[Speak & Read]] was published in 1980 with a shape identical to the Speak & Spell but with different game features and a different color scheme.<ref name=OrigSnRPR>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknRead.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Read (Type 1)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> Where the American Speak & Spell had been colored red with yellow and orange accents, the American Speak & Read was yellow with blue and green accents. Game<ref name=SnR>Ghazala, Reed. ''[http://www.makezine.com/pub/a/extras/32.html?page=last&x-maxdepth=0 Circuit-Bending: Build an Incantor]''. [[Make (magazine)|Make]]. 24 October 2005.</ref> cartridges for the Speak & Read were identical in shape to those of the main Speak & Spell line, and they could be physically inserted into units from the wrong line, however they did not function except in members of their own line.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_SpeaknRead_Lib.htm#Sea%20Sights Additional Pictures <nowiki>[4]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 23 December 2007.</ref> The Speak & Read was designed to focus on reading comprehension in children of ages 4<U+2013>8 with a library of over 250 basic words.<ref name=OrigSnRPR/>

The Speak & Read was very minutely redesigned in 1986, under the same name, with the new version representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknRead_86.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Read (Type 2)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> In 1988 the Super Speak & Read was released as a major redesign to feature a suitcase-like flip-open appearance.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SuperSpeaknRead.htm Texas Instruments Super Speak & Read]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> Cartridges were redesigned to be thinner and of a different shape,<ref name=SSnR>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_SuperSpeaknRead_Lib.htm#Reading%20Fun%201%20Expansion%20Pack Additional Pictures <nowiki>[5]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 23 December 2007.</ref> bearing some resemblance to the cartridges of TI's [[Touch & Discover]] line.<ref name=TnD>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_TouchnDiscoverSE.htm#headphone Additional Pictures <nowiki>[6]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 27 June 2005.</ref> Additionally, the keyboard was removed completely and a matrix of membrane buttons took its place similarly to the position sensitive "keyboard" of the Touch & Discover consoles.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/TouchnDiscover.htm Texas Instruments Touch & Discover]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> Each cartridge came with a work-booklet that would be laid out in an open position in the center of the Super Speak & Read and as questions were asked of the player he would press the appropriate portion of the work-booklet to depress the membrane button beneath. This was the last member of the Speak & Read line under this name, however the [[Ready... Set... Read!]] (sharing a highly similar design layout<ref name=RSR>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/ReadySetRead.htm Texas Instruments Ready..Set...Read!]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 15 December 2001.</ref>) and later [[Magic Reading Desk]] (featuring a modified Ready... Set... Read! layout<ref name=MRD>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/MagicReadingDesk.htm Texas Instruments Magic Reading Desk]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref>) are considered the Speak & Read's [[spiritual successor]]s. Both Ready... Set... Read! and Magic Reading Desk cartridges are identical in design to the Super Speak & Read's cartridges.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/JPEG_LaLectureMagique_Lib.htm#Module%20d%27Extension%20No1 Additional Pictures <nowiki>[7]</nowiki>]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 28 December 2007.</ref>

=== Speak & Math line ===
{{Main|Speak & Math}}
The [[Speak & Math]] (Sold as "Speak and Maths" in some countries) was published in 1980 with a shape identical to both the Speak & Spell and the [[Speak & Read]] but with a completely different keyboard layout, different game<ref name=SnM>''[http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/texas/ref434.htm Speak & Math Educational Product]''. [[National Museum of American History|Smithsonian NMAH]]. 15 June 1980.</ref><ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknMath.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Math (Type 1)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> features, and a different color scheme. Where the American Speak & Spell had been colored red with yellow and orange accents, the American Speak & Math was gray with blue and orange highlights. The Speak & Math was designed to focus on mathematics in children of ages 6<U+2013>12 with a library of over 100,000 random and preprogrammed problems.<ref name=SnM/> It was regarded as the [[spiritual successor]] to TI's earlier [[DataMan]] series,<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Edu/DataMan.htm Texas Instruments DataMan]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> with the difference mainly relating to the addition of speech synthesizing software and the visual display. The Speak & Math was only released to American and British markets.

In 1982, a compact version of the Speak & Math was developed contemporaneously with the Speak & Spell Compact. This version was only released in French as Les Maths Magique<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LesMathsMagiques.htm Texas Instruments Les Maths Magiques]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 12 July 2005.</ref> (lit. The Magical Math). A redesigned version was developed in 1985 for British markets under the name of Maths marvel.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/MathsMarvel.htm Texas Instruments Maths marvel]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> This was later released in Italian as Dotto Conta-Parla,<ref>Worener, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/DottoContaParla.htm Texas Instruments Dotto Conta-Parla]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 15 March 2004.</ref> in French as le Calcul magique<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LaCalcul.htm Texas Instruments le Calcul magique]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> (lit. Magical Calculator), and in German as Mathe-Fix.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/MatheFix.htm Texas Instruments Mathe-Fix]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref>

The Speak & Math was very minutely redesigned in 1986, under the same name, with the new version representing nothing more substantial than a redesign of the faceplate graphics.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SpeaknMath_86.htm Texas Instruments Speak & Math (Type 2)]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 25 December 2001.</ref> In 1990 the Super Speak & Math was released as a major redesign similar to the first version of the Super Speak & Spell.<ref>Woerner, Joerg. ''[http://www.datamath.org/Speech/SuperSpeaknMath.htm Texas Instruments Super Speak & Math]''. Datamath Calculator Museum. 5 December 2001.</ref> As with the Super Speak & Spell, the display screen of the Super Speak & Math was changed to an LCD screen instead of the former VFD screen. The keyboard was also expanded and given more functions. The general structure of the console was also altered similarly to the Super Speak & Spell such that the handle which had come at the top of the screen in prior Speak & Math units was now found on the bottom of the toy and [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] features were added to the shape.
