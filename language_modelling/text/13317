'''Mount St. Helens''' is an active [[stratovolcano]] located in [[Skamania County, Washington]], in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the [[United States]]. It is {{Convert|96|mi|km}} south of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and {{Convert|50|mi|km}} northeast of [[Portland, Oregon]]. Mount St. Helens takes its English name from the [[United Kingdom|British]] diplomat [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens|Lord St Helens]], a friend of explorer [[George Vancouver]] who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century.<ref name="gnis"/> The volcano is located in the [[Cascade Range]] and is part of the [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade Volcanic Arc]], a segment of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] that includes over 160 active [[volcano]]es. This volcano is well known for its [[volcanic ash|ash]] explosions and [[pyroclastic flow]]s.

Mount St. Helens is most notorious for [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|its catastrophic eruption]] on May 18, 1980, at 8:32 am PDT<ref name="USDA">{{cite web|publisher=[[USDA Forest Service]] |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20061123065550/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/|archivedate=2006-11-28|title=Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument}}</ref> which was the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States. Fifty-seven people were killed; 250 homes, 47 bridges, {{Convert|15|mi|km}} of railways, and {{Convert|185|mi|km}} of highway were destroyed. A massive [[debris avalanche]] triggered by an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale, caused an eruption, reducing the elevation of the mountain's summit from {{Convert|9677|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|8365|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and replacing it with a {{Convert|1|mi|km}} wide horseshoe-shaped crater.<ref name="USDATeacherCorner">{{cite web|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20090529034823/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-eruption-summary.shtml|archivedate=2009-05-29|title=May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens}}</ref> The debris avalanche was up to {{Convert|0.7|mi3|km3|1}} in volume. The [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]] was created to preserve the volcano and allow for its aftermath to be scientifically studied.

As with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St. Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of [[lava]] rock interlayered with ash, [[pumice]], and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of [[basalt]] and [[andesite]] through which several [[Lava dome|domes]] of [[dacite]] lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.

==Geographic setting and description==
===General===
[[File:St Helens and nearby area from space.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Landscape with a large open volcano|A view of St. Helens and the nearby area from space]]
Mount St. Helens is {{Convert|45|mi|km}} west of [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]], in the western part of the Cascade Range. These "sister and brother" volcanic mountains are approximately {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} from [[Mount Rainier]], the highest of Cascade volcanoes. [[Mount Hood]], the nearest major volcanic peak in [[Oregon]], is {{Convert|60|mi|km|-1}} southeast of Mount St. Helens.

Mount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago.<ref>Mullineaux, The Eruptive History of Mount St. Helens, USGS Professional Paper 1250, page 3</ref> The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the [[Holocene]] epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).<ref name="USGS-Description">[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/description_msh.html USGS Description of Mount St. Helens], USGS.gov . Retrieved 15 November 2006.</ref>

Prior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens was the fifth-highest peak in Washington. It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre-1980 summit cone, earning it the nickname "Fuji-san of America" ("[[Mount Fuji]] of America").<ref name="FireMountains201">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 201</ref> The peak rose more than {{Convert|5000|ft|m|-2}} above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges. The mountain is {{Convert|6|mi|km}} across at its base, which is at an altitude of {{Convert|4400|ft|m|-2}} on the northeastern side and {{Convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} elsewhere. At the pre-eruption [[tree line]], the width of the cone was {{Convert|4|mi|km}}.

[[File:Mount St. Helens Aerial 2009.jpg|thumb|alt=Snow covered mountain|Aerial view]]
[[Stream]]s that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: the [[Toutle River]] on the north and northwest, the Kalama River on the west, and the [[Lewis River (Washington)|Lewis River]] on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is {{Convert|140|in|mm|-2}}, and the snow pack on the mountain's upper slopes can reach {{Convert|16|ft|m|1}}.<ref name="Tilling1990"/> The Lewis River is impounded by three [[dam]]s for [[hydroelectric power]] generation. The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment, the Swift Reservoir, which is directly south of the volcano's peak.

Although Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through [[Cowlitz County, Washington|Cowlitz County]] to the west. [[Washington State Route 504|State Route 504]], locally known as the [[Spirit Lake Memorial Highway]], connects with [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] at Exit 49, {{Convert|34|mi|km}} to the west of the mountain. That north<U+2013>south highway skirts the low-lying cities of [[Castle Rock, Washington|Castle Rock]], [[Longview, Washington|Longview]] and [[Kelso, Washington|Kelso]] along the [[Cowlitz River]], and passes through the [[Vancouver, Washington]]<U+2013>[[Portland, Oregon]] [[metropolitan area]] less than {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is [[Cougar, Washington]], in the Lewis River valley {{Convert|11|mi|km}} south-southwest of the peak. [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]] surrounds Mount St. Helens.

===Crater Glacier and other new rock glaciers===
[[File:Summit rim of Mount St. Helens.ogv|thumb|220px|Summit rim of Mount St. Helens]]
{{Main|Crater Glacier}}
During the winter of 1980<U+2013>1981, a new [[glacier]] appeared. Now officially named [[Crater Glacier]], it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly ({{Convert|14|ft|m}} per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about {{Convert|0.36|sqmi|km2|2}}, and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of {{Convert|300|ft|m|-2}} and a maximum of {{Convert|650|ft|m|-2}}, nearly as deep as the much older and larger [[Carbon Glacier]] of Mount Rainier. The ice is all post<U+2013>1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the pre<U+2013>1980 glaciers combined.<ref name="Brugman81">{{cite web | last = Brugman | first = Melinda M. | coauthors = [[Austin Post]] | title = USGS Circular 850-D: Effects of Volcanism on the Glaciers of Mount St. Helens | url= http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir850D | year = 1981 | accessdate = 2007-03-07 }}</ref><ref name="Wiggins02" >{{cite journal | last = Wiggins | first = Tracy B. | coauthors = Hansen, Jon D.; Clark, Douglas H. | title = Growth and flow of a new glacier in Mt.

With the recent volcanic activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of [[icefall]]s heavily criss-crossed with [[crevasse]]s and [[serac]]s caused by movement of the crater floor.<ref name="VR">{{cite web|title=Volcano Review|archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20080626134702/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/volcano-review/documents/Volcano_Review_2008_Final_lowrez-201.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-26|format=PDF|publisher=[[US Forest Service]]}}</ref> The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe.

==Geologic history==
===Ancestral stages of eruptive activity===
[[File:Cascade Range related plate tectonics-en.svg|thumb|300px|alt=Map of the west coast of United States with dark lines in the ocean and location of Cascade Volcanoes.|[[Plate tectonics]] of the [[Cascade Range]]]]

The early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the "Ape Canyon Stage" (around 40<U+2013>35,000 years ago), the "Cougar Stage" (ca. 20<U+2013>18,000 years ago), and the "Swift Creek Stage" (roughly 13<U+2013>8,000 years ago).<ref name="USDAHistory">{{cite web|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20081011012508/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/volcanic-history-summary.shtml|archivedate=2008-10-11|title=Mount St. Helens - Summary of Volcanic History}}</ref> The modern period, since about 2500 BCE, is called the "Spirit Lake Stage". Collectively, the pre<U+2013>Spirit Lake stages are known as the "ancestral stages". The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of [[dacite]] and [[andesite]], while modern lava is very diverse (ranging from [[olivine]] [[basalt]] to andesite and dacite).<ref name="FireMountains214">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 214</ref>

St. Helens started its growth in the [[Pleistocene]] 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash.<ref name="FireMountains214"/> 36,000 years ago a large [[lahar|mudflow]] cascaded down the volcano;<ref name="FireMountains214"/> mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by [[glacier]]s 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current [[ice age]].<ref name="FireMountains214"/>

The second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 years ago and lasted for 2,000 years.<ref name="FireMountains214"/> [[Pyroclastic flow]]s of hot pumice and ash along with [[Lava dome|dome]] growth occurred during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with [[tephra]]. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.

===Smith Creek and Pine Creek eruptive periods===
A dormancy of about 4,000 years was broken around 2500 BCE with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period, when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish-brown pumice covered thousands of square miles. An eruption in 1900 BCE was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the [[Holocene]] epoch, judged by the volume of one of the tephra layers from that period. This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BCE and left {{Convert|18|in|cm}} deep deposits of material {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} distant in what is now [[Mt. Rainier National Park]]. Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as [[Banff National Park]] in [[Alberta]], and as far southeast as eastern [[Oregon]].<ref name="FireMountains215">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 215</ref> All told there may have been up to {{Convert|2.5|mi3|km3}} of material ejected in this cycle.<ref name="FireMountains215"/> Some 400 years of dormancy followed.

St. Helens came alive again around 1200 BCE <U+2014> the Pine Creek eruptive period.<ref name="FireMountains215"/> This lasted until about 800 BCE and was characterized by smaller-volume eruptions. Numerous dense, nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens' flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys. A large mudflow partly filled {{Convert|40|mi|km}} of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE.

===Castle Creek and Sugar Bowl eruptive periods===
The next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BCE, and is characterized by a change in composition of St. Helens' lava, with the addition of [[olivine]] and [[basalt]].<ref name="FireMountains216">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 216</ref> The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks ([[tephra]]) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BCE that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys.<ref name="FireMountains216"/> Others, such as Cave Basalt (known for its system of [[lava tube]]s), flowed up to {{Convert|9|mi|km}} from their vents.<ref name="FireMountains216"/> During the first century, mudflows moved {{Convert|30|mi|km|-1}} down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the [[Columbia River]]. Another 400 years of [[dormancy]] ensued.

The Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions.<ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/> During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.<ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/>

===Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods===
[[File:1890 Clohessy and Strengele engraving of Mount St Helens.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a rolling landscape with a conical mountain in background.|The symmetrical appearance of St. Helens prior to the 1980 eruption earned it the nickname "[[Mount Fuji]] of America". The once familiar shape was formed out of the Kalama and Goat Rocks eruptive periods.]]

Roughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480, when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt, beginning the Kalama period. The eruption in 1480 was several times larger than the May 18, 1980, eruption.<ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory">[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Publications/PP1563/eruptive_history.html Mount St. Helens Eruptive History], USGS.gov . Retrieved 15 November 2006.</ref> In 1482, another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred.<ref name="USGS-EruptiveHistory"/> Ash and pumice piled {{Convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the volcano to a thickness of {{Convert|3|ft|m|1}}; {{Convert|50|mi|km|-1}} away, the ash was {{Convert|2|in|cm|0}} deep. Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens' west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system.

This 150-year period next saw the eruption of less [[silica]]-rich lava in the form of [[andesitic]] ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers.<ref name="FireMountains216"/> Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank.<ref name="FireMountains216"/> Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit.<ref name="FireMountains217">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 217</ref> Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with [[Scree|talus]]. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647.<ref name="FireMountains217"/> 150 years of quiet returned to the volcano.

The 57-year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome, and is the first time that both oral and written records exist.<ref name="FireMountains217"/> Like the Kalama period, the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of [[dacite]] [[tephra]], followed by an andesite lava flow, and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome. The 1800 eruption probably rivalled the 1980 eruption in size, although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone. The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], northern [[Idaho]], and western [[Montana]]. There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857, including a fairly large one in 1842. The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank.<ref name="FireMountains217"/> Goat Rocks dome was the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption, and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18, 1980 that destroyed the entire north face and top {{Convert|1300|ft|m}} of the mountain.

On March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] 4.2 [[earthquake]];<ref name="USDA" /> and, on March 27, steam venting started.<ref name="USDAMay18">{{cite web|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20071113092736/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0322.shtml|archivedate=2007-11-13|title=Summary of Events Leading Up to the May 18, 1980, eruption of Mount St. Helens: March 22<U+2013>28}}</ref> By the end of April, the north side of the mountain had started to bulge.<ref name="USDAMay18_2">{{cite web|publisher=USDA Forest Service |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20071113092741/http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/education/teachers-corner/library/pre-eruption-0426.shtml|archivedate=2007-11-13|title=Summary of Events Leading Up to the May 18, 1980 Eruption of Mount St. Helens: April 26<U+2013>May 2}}</ref> 
On May 18, with little warning, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.1, triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain. It was the largest known [[debris avalanche]] in recorded history. The [[magma]] inside of St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale [[pyroclastic flow]] that flattened vegetation and buildings over {{Convert|230|sqmi|km2|-1}}. More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide were released into the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/activity/methods/gas/msh1980-88.php|title=Emission of sulfur dioxide gas from Mount St. Helens, 1980-1988|publisher=United States Geological Survey|date=2008-09-25|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref> On the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]] scale, the eruption was rated a five (a [[Plinian eruption]]).

The collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create [[lahar]]s (volcanic mudflows). The lahars flowed many miles down the [[Toutle River|Toutle]] and [[Cowlitz River]]s, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of {{Convert|3900000|yd3|m3|-5}} of material was transported {{Convert|17|mi|km}} south into the [[Columbia River]] by the mudflows.<ref>Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 209</ref>

For more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching 12 to 16 miles (20 to 27&nbsp;km) above sea level.<ref>Kiver and Harris, ''Geology of U.S. Parklands'', 6th edition, page 149</ref> The plume moved eastward at an average speed of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1}} with ash reaching [[Idaho]] by noon. Ashes from the eruption were found collecting on top of cars and roofs next morning, as far as the city of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada.

====2004 to 2008 activity====
{{Main|2004<U+2013>2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens}}

Magma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome's south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as the "whaleback," which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.<ref>see [http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Imgs/Jpg/MSH/MSH05/MSH05_dome_from_sugarbowl_tip_spine_collapse_July2005_med.jpg USGS before and after images]</ref>

[[File:Whaleback 2-22-05.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Large fairly smooth rock structure inside a crater|Appearance of the "Whaleback" in February 2005]]

Mount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a {{Convert|36000|ft|m|adj=on}} plume of steam and ash emerged<U+2014>visible from [[Seattle]].<ref>[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Eruption04/Monitoring/plume_in_the_evening_8march05.html Mount St. Helens, Washington, "Plume in the Evening"], March 8, 2005, USGS.gov . Retrieved 15 November 2006.</ref> This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building. The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2.5 earthquake.

Another feature to emerge from the dome was called the "fin" or "slab." Approximately half the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as {{convert|6|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} per day.<ref name=kgw>{{cite news|title=New slab growing in Mount St. Helens dome|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,194342,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-06|newspaper=Fox News}}</ref><ref>See [http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap060509.html close-up of the slab.]</ref> In mid-June 2006, the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls, although it was still being extruded. The height of the dome was {{Convert|7550|ft|m}}, still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.

On October 22, 2006, at 3:13 p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume {{Convert|2000|ft|m|-2}} over the western rim of the crater; the [[ash plume]] then rapidly dissipated.

On December 19, 2006, a large white plume of condensing steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption. However, the [[Cascades Volcano Observatory]] of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume.<ref>[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/ Cascades Volcano Observatory, vulcan.wr.usgs.gov (accessed January 4, 2007)]</ref> The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.

On January 16, 2008, steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome. Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004. Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks, but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2008-01-17-3582451403_x.htm|title=Small Quake Reported at Mount St. Helens|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=2010-12-06}}</ref> By the end of January, the eruption paused; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome.  On July 10, 2008, it was determined that the eruption had ended after more than six months of no volcanic activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/MSH/Eruption04/framework.html |title=CVO Menu - Mount St. Helens Eruption 2004 |publisher=Vulcan.wr.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref>

==Human history==
===Importance to Native Americans===
[[File:St Helens before 1980 eruption horizon fixed.jpg|thumb|alt=Mt St Helens before the 1980 eruption (taken from Spirit Lake)|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] legends were inspired by the volcano's beauty.]]

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of these is the [[Bridge of the Gods (geologic event)|Bridge of the Gods]] legend told by the Klickitats. In their tale, the chief of all the gods<!--, [[Tyhee Saghalie]],--> and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the [[Columbia River]] from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.<ref name="CountyRoads">Archie Satterfield, ''Country Roads of Washington'' (Backinprint.com: 2003) ISBN 0-595-26863-3, page 82</ref>

They came upon an area that is now called [[The Dalles]] and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land, so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow &mdash; one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. The chief of the gods then built <!--[[Tanmahawis]],--> the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.<ref name="CountyRoads"/>

When the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the [[Plunge waterfalls|cascades]] of the [[Columbia River Gorge]].<ref>[http://www.theoutlaws.com/indians4.htm The Bridge of the Gods], theoutlaws.com . Retrieved November 26, 2006.</ref>

For punishment, the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means "smoking or fire mountain" in their language (the [[Sahaptin people|Sahaptin]] called the mountain Loowit).<ref name=crvn>{{cite web|title=Volcanoes and History: Cascade Range Volcano Names|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/volcano_names.html|author=USGS|accessdate=2006-10-20}}</ref>

===Exploration by Europeans===
[[Royal Navy]] Commander [[George Vancouver]] and the officers of [[HMS Discovery (1789)|HMS ''Discovery'']] made the Europeans' first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on May 19, 1792, while surveying the northern [[Pacific Ocean]] coast. Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat [[Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens]] on October 20, 1792,<ref name="crvn"/> as it came into view when the ''Discovery'' passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.

Years later, explorers, traders, and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area. Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800, marking the beginning of the 57-year-long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period (see [[#Geologic history|geology section]]).<ref name = "FireMountains217"/> Alarmed by the "dry snow," the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation.<ref name="FireMountains217"/>

In late 1805 and early 1806, members of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one.<ref>Pringle, ''Roadside Geology of Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument and Vicinity''</ref> They did however report the presence of [[quicksand]] and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]] near Portland, suggesting an eruption by [[Mount Hood]] sometime in the previous decades.

In 1829 [[Hall J. Kelley]] led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former [[President of the United States]]. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Meany |first= Edmond S. |authorlink= Edmond S.

===European settlement and use of the area===
[[File:Fur trapper in Mount St Helen area.jpg|thumb|alt=Man by wooden building that has six fur pelts on it.|19th century photo of a [[fur trapper]] working in the Mount St. Helens area]]

The first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by [[Meredith Gairdner]], while working for the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at [[Fort Vancouver]].<ref name="FireMountains219">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 219</ref> He sent an account to the ''Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal'', which published his letter in January 1836. [[James Dwight Dana]] of [[Yale University]], while sailing with the [[United States Exploring Expedition]], saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described "cellular basaltic lavas" at the mountain's base.<ref name="USGS-LewisClark">[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/LewisClark/Info/summary_mount_st_helens.html The Volcanoes of Lewis and Clark], USGS.gov .

[[File:Mount St Helens erupting at night by Paul Kane.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Painting of a conical volcano erupting at night from the side.|Painting by [[Paul Kane]] ''Mount St. Helens erupting at night'' after his 1847 visit to the area]]
In late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called "Great Eruption". This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years.<ref>Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, pages 220<U+2013>221</ref> The eruptions of this period were likely [[phreatic eruption|phreatic]] (steam explosions). [[Josiah L. Parrish|Josiah Parrish]] in [[Champoeg, Oregon]] witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22, 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached [[The Dalles, Oregon]], 48 miles (80&nbsp;km) southeast of the volcano.<ref name="USGS-Description"/>

In October 1843, future [[California]] governor [[Peter Hardeman Burnett|Peter H. Burnett]] recounted a story of an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napolean McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident.<ref>Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 224</ref> British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, and two years later Canadian painter [[Paul Kane]] created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.<ref>Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 225, 227</ref>

On April 17, 1857, the ''Republican'', a [[Steilacoom, Washington]], newspaper, reported that "Mount St. Helens, or some other mount to the southward, is seen ... to be in a state of eruption".<ref name="FireMountains228">Harris, ''Fire Mountains of the West'', 1st edition, page 228</ref> The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption. This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854.<ref name="FireMountains228"/>

Before the 1980 eruption, [[Spirit Lake (Washington)|Spirit Lake]] offered year-round recreational activities. In the summer there was [[boating]], [[human swimming|swimming]], and [[camping]], while in the winter there was [[skiing]].

===Human impact from the 1980 eruption===

83-year-old [[Harry Randall Truman|Harry R. Truman]], who had lived near the mountain for 54 years, became famous when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption, despite repeated pleas by local authorities. His body was never found after the eruption. 

Another victim of the 1980 eruption was 30-year-old [[vulcanologist]] [[David A. Johnston]], who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge. Moments before his position was hit by the hot ash cloud, Johnston radioed his famous last words: "Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!"<ref>Scott LaFee.

Retrieved October 26, 2006.</ref> Johnston's body was never found.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] surveyed the damage and said, "Someone said this area looked like a moonscape.

Their [[compass]]es, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] helicopter pilots. Their film, ''The Eruption of Mount St. Helens'', later became a popular documentary.

===Protection and later history===
[[File:Mt st helens Johnston ridge 25 years later.jpg|thumb|alt=Grass, dead fallen trees and scrubs|View of the hillside at the Johnston Ridge Observatory, 25 years after the eruption.]]
In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] and the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] established the [[Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument]], a {{Convert|110000|acre|ha|-3}} area around the mountain and within the [[Gifford Pinchot National Forest]].<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/04mshnvm/general/index.shtml Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument: General Visitor Information], USDA Forest Service . Retrieved 12 November 2006.</ref>

Following the 1980 eruption, the area was left to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when [[2004<U+2013>2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens|renewed activity]] caused the closure of the area around the mountain (see ''Geological history'' section above for more details).

Most notable was the closure of the Monitor Ridge trail, which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/recreation/current-conditions/special.shtml Climbing Mount St. Helens], USDA Forest Service .

The mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000-4900 feet. The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping, biking, pets, fires, and off-trail excursions are all prohibited.<ref>{{cite summitpost |id=742347 |name=Loowit Trail |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5160314.pdf |title=Mount St. Helens Volcanic National Monument: Restricted Area |publisher=U.S. Forrest Service |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref>
