'''Sigebert of East Anglia''' (also known as '''Saint Sigebert''') was [[List of monarchs of East Anglia|King of East Anglia]] from c 629 to c634. He was the first [[English people|English]] king to receive a Christian baptism and education before coming into his regnal power, and the first to abdicate in order to enter the monastic life. He played a most important part in the establishment of Christianity in his kingdom. 

==Family, Exile, Conversion and Education==
The most reliable source for him is [[The Venerable Bede]]'s [[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History of the English People]] (produced 731). [[Bede]] states that he was the son of [[Raedwald of East Anglia|Raedwald]] (r.c 599-624), but [[William of Malmesbury]] describes him as the step-son. The latter is indicated because the name Sigebert is unlike any in the East Anglian Wuffinga dynasty, but closely resembles the name fashions of the East Saxon royal house. If that identification is correct, Raedwald's wife had previously been the wife of an East Saxon prince or ruler. Raedwald's own principal heir was Raegenhere (a youth of warrior age in 616, when he was slain in battle) and his second heir was [[Eorpwald of East Anglia|Eorpwald]], slain by the heathen [[Ricberht of East Anglia|Ricberht]] in c 627. (There is no ancient record that Ricbert was a son of Raedwald's, nor that he was a king.) 

Eorpwald, despite his father Raedwald's personal conversion and baptism before 616, and the existence of a Christan altar in Raedwald's temple, was not himself a convert at the time of his accession in c 624. Since it is known that Raedwald's Queen (also Sigeberht's own mother) did not become Christian, Sigeberht received limited encouragement in the Faith. He was exiled in Gaul for a long time during the lifetime of Eorpwald, 'while fleeing from the enmity of Raedwald' (says Bede, iii.18). This supports the stepson theory, if Raedwald was protecting Eorpwald's succession against a possible claim by a son not of the Wuffing line. While in [[Gaul]] Sigeberht was converted and baptized, and became a very Christian and a very learned man. He was strongly impressed by the religious institutions and schools for the study of reading and writing which he found in Gaul.

==Sigeberht's Accession==
After the interregnum prompted by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigebert was recalled from Gaul to become ruler of the East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a military commander was later remembered. During his reign part of the Kingdom was governed by his kinsman [[Egric of East Anglia|Ecgric]], the relationship described by the Latin term ''cognatus''. This may mean that Ecgric was a son of Raedwald. However some authorities consider Ecgric to be the same person as AEthilric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the ''Anglian Collection'') as a son of [[Eni of East Anglia|Eni]], Raedwald's brother. Whoever Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt both in eastern and western parts of the kingdom.

Sigebert's Christian conversion may have been a decisive factor in his achieving royal power, since at that time [[Edwin of Northumbria]] (616-632/3) was the senior English king, and only he and [[Eadbald of Kent]] were Christian rulers. Eadbald certainly had contacts with the Frankish rulers. After [[Dagobert I|Dagobert]] succeeded [[Clotaire II|Clothar II]] in Francia in 628, Sigeberht's emergence helped to strengthen the English conversion upon which Edwin's power rested. Sigeberht is likely to have encouraged the conversion of Ecgric, if he was not already Christian. Edwin's encouragement took shape in the marriage of his grand-niece Hereswith, sister of Saint [[Hilda of Whitby|Hilda]], to Aethilric, Raedwald's nephew. Hereswith and Hild were under Edwin's protection and were baptised with him in 626. This marriage held the presumption that Aethilric was, or would become, Christian, and probably also that he should at some time become King of East Anglia.

==Foundation of the East Anglian bishopric - Saint Felix ==
Bede relates that the East Anglian apostle Saint [[Felix of Burgundy|Felix]] came to England from [[Burgundy]] as a missionary bishop, and was sent by Archbishop [[Saint Honorius|Honorius]] of Canterbury to assist Sigeberht. [[William of Malmesbury]] has the later story that Felix accompanied Sigeberht to East Anglia. In either case, this dates Sigeberht's accession to c[[629]]-[[630]], because Felix was Bishop for 17 years, his successor Thomas for 5, and his successor Berhtgisl Boniface for 17 - and Berhtgisl died in around [[669]]. Sigebert established the bishop's seat of his kingdom for Felix at [[Dommoc]], claimed variously for [[Dunwich]] or [[Walton]], [[Felixstowe]] (both coastal sites in Suffolk). If at Walton (as Rochester claimed during the thirteenth century), the site of Dommoc may have been within the precinct of a Roman fort which formerly stood there. 

== Foundation of the East Anglian School ==
Sigeberht also established a school in his kingdom for boys to be taught reading and writing in Latin, on the model that he had witnessed in Gaul. Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in [[Kent]]. [[Paulinus of York]] was from [[633]] to [[644]] bishop of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]] on the [[Medway]], then the nearest bishopric in Kent to East Anglia. Paulinus had (according to the [[Whitby]] Life of [[Gregory the Great]]) been connected with the court of Raedwald during the exile of Edwin.

==The Irish Mission to East Anglia - Saint Fursey ==
The allegiance of Felix to Canterbury determined the Roman basis of the East Anglian Church, though his training in Burgundy may have been coloured by the teaching of the Irish missionary Saint [[Columbanus]] in [[Luxeuil]]. In around [[633]], perhaps shortly before Saint [[Aidan of Lindisfarne|Aidan]] was sent to [[Lindisfarne]] from [[Iona]], the Irish royal hermit and missionary [[Saint Fursey]] came from the [[Athlone]] area with his priests and brethren to East Anglia. Sigeberht granted him a monastery site in an old [[Roman fort]] called Cnobheresburg, usually identified as [[Burgh Castle]] near [[Yarmouth]]. Felix and Fursey both effected many conversions and established churches in Sigebert's kingdom. Bede records that Archbishop Honorius and Bishop Felix much admired the work of Saint Aidan of Lindisfarne. Therefore it is likely that they also appreciated of Saint Fursey, whose community also lived according to the ascetic principles of [[Irish Christianity]]. 

==Sigeberht's monastery and his religious abdication ==
Not long afterwards Sigebert, who had built a monastery for his own use, abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired there to conduct a religious life. Bede does not say where, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called [[Bury St Edmunds]]. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval Abbey Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom it was originally named. The site occupied a strong position on the upper reaches of the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great [[Fen]] through important early settlements at [[Icklingham]], [[Culford]], [[West Stow]] and others. This was a line of access towards [[Ely]], where a foundation of Saint [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]] may already have existed, and towards [[Soham]] ([[Cambridgeshire]]), where Saint Felix is thought to have founded a monastery. 

The much later formation of West Suffolk and East Suffolk (distinct counties until 1974) reflected the topographical distinction between the eastern watershed draining towards the sea, with its power centre at Rendlesham and trade capital at [[Ipswich]], and the western rivers draining to the Fen, of which Bury became the county town.

==A Mercian attack: Sigeberht's martyrdom in battle==
In 636 East Anglia was attacked by the armies of [[Mercia]], and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller (though not negligible) force. The East Angles appealed to Sigebert to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence and the memory of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigebert refused, saying that he had renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. Sigebert, Ecgric, and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way King Sigebert of the East Angles won the palm of martyrdom. Bede (HE iii,18) indicates that the leader of the Mercian assault was [[Penda of Mercia|Penda]], and Sigebert is among the names of the kings who, according to an ancient proverb, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654. 

Penda never accepted Christian teaching, and made war against the powers associated with it, seeing himself as the rightful representative of Anglian custom, rule and identity. However, the Christianity which Sigebert had done so much to establish in East Anglia was strongly maintained and developed in the reign of his successor, King Anna. As a royal martyr Sigbert's feast day was observed variously on 16 January or 27 September.
