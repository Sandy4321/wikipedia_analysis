The following is an '''episode list''' for the American TV show '''''[[Carniv<U+00E0>le]]''''', created by [[Daniel Knauf]]. The series premiered on [[September 14]], [[2003]], on [[HBO]] and finished its two-season run of 24 episodes on [[March 27]], [[2005]]. Until late in the second season, each episode is split into two distinct but slowly converging story lines taking place in the [[United States]] [[Dustbowl]] of the mid-1930s. [[Nick Stahl]] starred as [[Ben Hawkins]], a young [[Okie]] farmer with strange powers who joins a [[traveling carnival]]; [[Clancy Brown]] played his adversary [[Brother Justin Crowe]], a [[California]] preacher who uses his similarly strange abilities to rise to power. ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' was originally intended to run as a trilogy of paired seasons, with each pair being called a "book" and the series as a whole spanning the years from 1934 till 1945, but the show was cancelled after two seasons due to low ratings. These two seasons complete the first book covering the years 1934 and 1935. The second book (seasons three and four) would have taken place around the years 1939 and 1940, and the third book (seasons five and six) would have played in 1944 and 1945, leading up to the end of [[World War II]] and the explosion at the [[Trinity test]] site.<ref name=jimmy>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimmy.fr/series/carnival/interview.html |title=Interview de Daniel Knauf |publisher=jimmy.fr |language=[[French language|French]] |date=April 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref><ref name=carnycon2006>[[Daniel Knauf]] at Carny Con 2006.

The character of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each season with a monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and [[good and evil|good-versus-evil]] mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' is a demanding show with a lot of subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information.<ref name=wga>{{cite web |last=Callaghan |first=Dylan |url=http://www.wga.org/subpage.aspx?id=553 |title=In the Ring with Good and Evil |publisher=wga.org |date=2005 |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref><ref name=ign_movies>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/577/577934p1.html |title=Carnivale: Second Season Premiere |publisher=movies.ign.com |date=[[January 7]], [[2005]] |accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref><ref name=dreadcentral>{{cite web | last=Kasch | first=Andrew | title = Carniv<U+00E0>le: The Complete Second Season (DVD) | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/index.php?name=Reviews&req=showcontent&id=1066 | date=[[September 8]], [[2006]] | publisher=dreadcentral.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s.<ref name=variety_review1>{{cite web | last=Gallo | first=Phil | title=Recently Reviewed &ndash; Carniv<U+00E0>le | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921817.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |date=[[September 11]], [[2003]] | publisher=variety.com | accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref><ref name=ew.com>{{cite web | last=Chocano |first=Carina | title=TV Review &ndash; Carnivale (2003) | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,482486,00.html |date=[[September 12]], [[2003]] | publisher=ew.com | accessdate=2007-09-08}}</ref><ref name=variety_review2>{{cite web | last=Lowry | first=Brian | title=Recently Reviewed &ndash; Carniv<U+00E0>le | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117925844.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |date=[[January 6]], [[2005]] | publisher=variety.com |accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including 15 [[Emmy]] nominations with 5 wins.<ref name=emmy>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/2007pt/history.php |title=Primetime Awards |publisher=emmys.org |accessdate=2007-08-27}} Nominations available as PDF for [http://www.emmys.tv/downloads/images/2004emmys/2004emmynoms.pdf 2004] and [http://www.emmys.tv/downloads/images/2005emmys/2005noms.pdf 2005]. emmys.tv.

 |ShortSummary=After showing Ben an [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Trinity|explosion of massive destruction in a desert]], Management reveals himself as Lucius Belyakov, the Russian soldier from Ben's dreams. He tells Ben to find Henry Scudder to learn the name of his enemy, the preacher from his dreams. Samson is to further act as their intermediary, and it is his first task to get rid of Lodz's body. Jonesy and Sofie are the only ones to survive the trailer fire; Samson presents Appolonia's burned body to the police, claiming that fugitive Ben was killed in the fire. Meanwhile, Scudder's trinket prompts Ben to revisit the Templar Lodge in Loving, where he learns that Scudder was once involved with [[chaplain]] Devin Kerrigan. After meeting in 1923, Kerrigan seemingly lost his mind and painted a tattooed man into a Templar mural; he is now institutionalized in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]].{{<U+2022>}} Brother Justin visits Norman, who after suffering a stroke is unable to speak.

Following another vision at the foot of the tree, Justin declares, "this will be my New [[Canaan]].{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} Here, I will build a temple." Wilfred Talbot Smith meets up with Brother Justin in Dolan's radio studio, predicting Justin will become the Prophet and the Usher as soon as he kills a man named Henry Scudder.

As Justin and Iris mount the Ferris wheel for a long ride, Ben begins to perform a mass-healing act as Benjamin St. John. After crumbling in pain and ripping his shirt open for everyone to see, Justin stops the Ferris wheel and enters Ben's tent. He pulls out the sickle that already killed Scudder, lacerates several devotees and Norman standing in his way, and pursues Ben into a cornfield. Justin cuts Ben on the arm and abdomen, and Ben's blade breaks apart. With Justin towering over him ready to carry out his last task, Ben remembers Management's words, grabs his broken blade and plunges it deep into Justin's tattooed chest where the branches meet. Meanwhile, Jonesy has tracked Stroud to Sofie's place, overpowers him and releases her, but Sofie shoots Jonesy down. The next morning, the carnies find Brother Justin with Emma's blade in his chest and bring Ben, still breathing, back to their camp. Stumpy and Rita Sue, whose outstanding debts are now covered by Iris's honorarium, reassure Libby that Jonesy will soon return. In the meantime, Sofie approaches Justin and places her hands on his chest. As Iris sees the corn die around them, the carnival leaves New Canaan with Ben's unconscious body bouncing in Management's bed...<ref name = "New Canaan">{{cite episode | title = New Canaan | series = Carniv<U+00E0>le | serieslink = Carniv<U+00E0>le | credits = [[Scott Winant]] | writers = [[Tracy Torm<U+00E9>]] (story), [[Daniel Knauf]] (teleplay) | network = HBO | airdate = 2005-03-27 | season = 2 | number = 12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hbo.com/carnivale/episode/season2/episode24.shtml |title=Episode 24 &ndash; "New Canaan" |publisher=hbo.com |year=2005 |accessdate=2007-10-29}}</ref> (''see also [[Characters of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Season 2 finale and character fates|Characters of Carniv<U+00E0>le: Season 2 finale and character fates]]'').

[[Image:Map USA Carnivale Route.PNG|thumb|250px|Carnival stops.]]
'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} Mintern is a fictional town in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] in [[San Benito County, California]].<ref>
* '''Tommy Dolan:''' "Val [Templeton] is an important man here in Mintern. Indeed, he is fast becoming one of the most important men in the entire [[San Joaquin Valley]]." ("The River").
* '''Tommy Dolan:''' "Your car was seen leaving the area ten minutes before the fire." '''Brother Justin:''' "A [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] was seen." '''Dolan:''' "A black Model A [[Sedan]] was seen." '''Justin:''' "There must be thousands." '''Dolan:''' "Right, but only 29 registered in [[San Benito County, California|San Benito County]] and four in Mintern property." ("Los Moscos").</ref> When Brother Justin loses his faith in God in the middle of Season 1, he leaves his Mintern home and heads for the San Joaquin Valley wilderness near [[Kingsburg, California|Kingsburg]].<ref>
* '''Tommy Dolan:''' "Tonight, I'd like to tell you another story I found on the road in the Great [[San Joaquin Valley]]. [...] It's the story of a man named Brother Justin and a town called Mintern." ("Pick a Number").
* '''Tommy Dolan:''' "We [Justin and I] were passing a bottle around a campfire just outside [[Kingsburg, California|Kingsburg]]." ("The River").</ref> After visiting Norman in the hospital early in Season 2, Brother Justin and Iris head home and pass a [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#The Tattooed Man and the tree|tree]]; Justin names this location "New [[Canaan]]", the future site of his temple. New Canaan is located south of [[Salinas, California|Salinas]] in San Benito County, California.<ref>
* '''Ned Munson:''' "Without them Okies, Devine has a fix on the whole district." '''Brother Justin:''' "Once the voters of [[San Benito County, California|San Benito County]] understand the choice presented to them, there will be no question for whom they will cast their ballot." ("Outside New Canaan").
* '''Samson:''' "We're going to New Canaan. [...] Big Christian camp in California. Couple hours from here. [...] South of [[Salinas, California|Salinas]]." ("Outside New Canaan").</ref> The last Season 2 episode is named "New Canaan, CA" on DVDs.

'''b.''' {{Note_label|B|b|none}} Babylon is a fictional town in [[Texas]].<ref>'''Postmark''' on Scudder's letter to Rebecca Donovan: "''Babylon &ndash; Jul 24 1921 P.M. &ndash; TEX''" ("Alamogordo, NM").</ref> It became a [[ghost town]] after a cave-in in 1921 killed all miners but Scudder.

'''c.''' {{Note_label|C|c|none}} Los Moscos is a real area in [[Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]], near the southwest US [[New Mexico]] border,<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=de&geocode=&q=Los+Moscos&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=36.231745,96.328125&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1 Los Moscos]. maps.google.com. Retrieved on [[2007-10-09]].</ref> but its significance as the name of the first season 2 episode is never clarified. It is however established that Ben and the carnival spend most of their time in Loving, New Mexico during this and the previous episodes.<ref>'''Streetsign:''' "''Welcome to Loving, N.M. Pop. 2,315''" ("Hot and Bothered").</ref> ''Carniv<U+00E0>le'' suggests that Loving does not refer to [[Loving, New Mexico]] in the southeast of the state, near Texas, since the (fictional) town is said to be less than a mile from the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border in the Western part of New Mexico,<ref>
* '''Jonesy:''' "We're less than a mile from the [Mexican] border." ("Hot and Bothered").
* '''Streetsign''' on Ben's route from Loving to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]: "''[[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] 95; Alamogordo 165.''" ("Los Moscos").</ref> thematically and geographically likely close to Los Moscos.

'''d.''' {{Note_label|D|d|none}} [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]] was the headquarter of the [[Trinity site]], where humankind's first nuclear test took place in 1945. [[Mythology of Carniv<U+00E0>le#Trinity|Ben's vision of the atomic bomb]] takes place in a desert nearby, ten years before the nuclear explosion would actually occur.

'''e.''' {{Note_label|E|e|none}} [[Lincoln Highway]] is the first road across America, conceived in 1912. During the episode, the carnival rests in [[Wyoming]] close to the [[Nebraska]] border,<ref>
* '''Streetsign''' near the carnival's location: "''Wonderful Wyoming &ndash; Entering Wyoming &ndash; Drive carefully &ndash; Enjoy your trip vacation.''" ("Lincoln Highway").
* '''Samson:''' "But we're over state line now. So the [[Nebraska|Nebrasky]] cops can't get to us. Or whoever else has a mind to." ("Lincoln Highway").
* '''Samson:''' "There. Cheyenne." '''Ben:''' "That's right down the highway." '''Samson:''' "If you skin for it, I'll wager you'd make it in two, three hours, tops." ("Lincoln Highway").
* '''Streetsign''' on Ben's route to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]]: "''Lincoln Highway &ndash; Cheyenne 53 mi. [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] 91 mi. [[Rock Springs, Wyoming|Rock Springs]] 250 mi.''" ("Lincoln Highway").
* '''Streetsign''' where Ben heals Jonesy: "''Cheyenne &ndash; Clean & Friendly Motor Court &ndash; 17 miles''" ("Lincoln Highway").</ref> but the episode is misleadingly called "Lincoln Highway, UT" on DVDs.
