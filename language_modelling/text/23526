'''Alfred County Railway''' is an abandoned [[narrow gauge]] [[railway]] in [[South Africa]], which runs from the southern transport hub of [[Port Shepstone]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], via Izotsha and Paddock for {{convert|122|km|mi}} to [[Harding, KwaZulu-Natal]].

==Background==
South Africa, rich in natural resources and high soil richness, provides an ideal location in which to grow agricultural produce. The problem of this and the steep mountainous terrain, is how to ship the produce from the high velt to the coastal ports?

When well maintained and reliable-access roads did not exist narrow gauge railways were hence extensively used by South African farmers to extract produce from their large farms to central sorting and packing points on their own land. It hence became easy for entrepreneurial business people to create linking railways to transport the produce to the coastal ports, there by reducing costs and increasing competitiveness. Their choice of gauge was determined by that which dominated the local, and varied between the early {{RailGauge|1ft11.5in}} to the later [[Cape gauge]] of {{RailGauge|1067}}.

==Original operations==
Designed as part of the [[Natal Province|Natal Government Railways]] project to bring the [[sugar cane]] and [[banana]]s produced in the agricultural Harding district to Port Shepstone, the NGR commissioned [[Stoke-on-Trent]] based [[Kerr Stuart]] to build seven [[South African Class NG4|Class NG4]] 4-6-2 tank locomotives, based on the 1907 [[South African Class NG3|Class NG3]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandstone-estates.com/heritage/rail/news/rn243_running_ahead/rn243_running_ahead.htm|title= South African Railways Class NG4 4-6-2T|publisher=[[Sandstone Estates]]|date=2006-09-12|accessdate=2009-07-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The route had some curves of 45 metres, but with gradients of up to 3 in 100/3%, the NG4's and their replacements were often double-headed to haul the diverse freight traffic of [[wood]], [[sugar cane]] and [[banana]]'s to Port Shepstone. The line's management dismissed the opportunity to purchase more powerful articulated-[[Garratt]] locomotives, as due to their longer wheelbase access to the sugar cane fields would become more difficult.

From the mid-1970s, steam was replaced by [[South African Class 91-000|Class 91-000]] diesel-electric locomotives on the [[South African Railways|SAR]]'s longer routes, which were both more powerful and being shorter in chassis length more able to access the growers farms. SAR hence decided to transfer the [[South African Class NG G13|NG G13]]s and NG G16 [[Garratt]]s to [[Natal Province|Natal]] to the Alfred County Railway.

Under invested and hence unreliable, the ACR was closed to operations by SAR in 1986.

==Port Shepstone and Alfred County Railway==
As South Africa's farmer re-entered the global markets, the quality of produce became essential. As handling is a key issue in the retail quality of bananas in particular, the farmers were positive about a revival of the ACR, which would reduce the amount of handling from tree to port.

To raise funds and reduce government expenditure, the [[Government of South Africa]] announced it would gradually put into private hands its huge state-owned corporations, including the state electricity corporation, [[Eskom]], and [[Transnet|SA Transport Services]] which owned SAR. The ACR was hence chosen as the pilot railway privatisation project.

In reality, SAR/Transnet still owned the line, infrastructure and the stock as a nationally strategic asset; while the new '''Port Shepstone and Alfred County Railway''' (PSACR) was granted an operational and maintenance lease for a period of 199 years. The company inherited 25 steam locomotives - of which only one, an NG G16, was operational - plus rolling stock. The company announced a business plan expected to win back lucrative business from farmers and timber growers. In March 1988, the PSACR raised funds by offering 1.8 million shares for sale at one [[South African rand|rand]] each.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDC1130F93BA15750C0A96E948260|title=South Africa Rail Offering|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-10 | date=1988-03-28}}</ref>

===SAR NG G16A===
As part of their development to keep the railway competitive, ACR developed two of their existing [[South African Class NG G16|Class NG G16]]. The engineers incorporated developments outlined by [[Livio Dante Porta|L.D. Porta]], including GPCS, Lempor exhaust, an improved spark arrestor, lightweight multi-ring articulated piston valves, improved valve events and improved mechanical lubrication. Two locomotives were treated, No.141 in 1989 and the second No.155 in 1990. In comparative testing 141 gave a fuel saving of 25% compared to a standard SAR Class NG G16 Garratt, easily maintained in regular service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/tusp/girdlestone.html|title=girdlestone|publisher=trainweb.org|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>

===Demise to road transport===
The venture lost money heavily initially, but after making profits from year three decided to try to return to an all-steam powered railway. The Banana Express had always been steam powered, while the advantages of power and a short wheelbase meant that PSACR had taken advantage of leasing SAR 91 Class diesels to provide it commercial freight services.<ref name="Pipex"/>

The revived PSACR became [[Spoornet]]<U+2019>s second largest customer at Port Shepstone. This was driven by the operations of Kulu Lime and the Natal Portland Cement, plus pulpwood, [[poplar tree|poplar]] logs (for [[match]]wood), [[creosote]]d [[telegraph pole]]s, and manufactured wooden items from Harding. North bound inland traffic was general cargo to serve the farmers, such as [[maize]], [[fertilizer]], [[salt]], [[cement]], farm implements and water tanks and small parcels. The company also revived the tourist driven [[passenger train]], the Banana Express.<ref name="rraza">{{cite web|url=http://www.rra.co.za/media.cgi?id=6597&action=det|title=Alfred County Railway two years on (1990)|publisher=Railroad Association of South Africa|date=July 1990|accessdate=2009-07-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1991 Spoornet acquired one-million shares in PSACR, equivalent to a 28% shareholding, which gave users greater confidence in the PSACR service. The <U+201C>Narrow Arrow<U+201D> piggyback train was introduced for supply to the Port Shepstone pulp mill, where an entire train of 26 narrow gauge wagons was ramped onto a Spoornet train consisting of 13 wagons, having flexible connecting bridges. This eliminated the transshipping of timber at Port Shepstone and reduced transfer time from 14 hours to two. A further endeavour was the <U+201C>Timbertainer,<U+201D> an intermodal system where pulpwood could be loaded into an open container in the plantation and taken through to the mill. Plans were in place for a similar initiative in sugar cane shipment.<ref name="rraza"/>

However, by the mid-1990s the effects of transport deregulation began to show, with larger often overloaded trucks becoming ever more competitive. Although Spoornet made representations to the government, transport regulations were further relaxed to allow a higher gross vehicle mass (GVM) of
{{convert|56000|kg|LT}}, a higher axle load from {{convert|8.2|and|9.0|LT|kg}}, together with a 5% overload tolerance: the highest heavy vehicle mass with unlimited access to the roads of any country in the world.

Resultantly, Spoornet began to lose general freight traffic, and PSACR's reliance on trans-shipment increased transport times and costs.<ref name="rraza"/> The railway began a gradual decline, eventually failing in 2001 when it lost the key Port Shepstone "Narrow Arrow" wood pulping contract, due to national unreliability problems resulting from labour relation issues at Spoornet.<ref name="rraza"/>

Suspending freight operations, the line continued to operate the Banana Express, but accumulated huge debts to Spoornet. In light of lease debts, Transnet decided to legally force the venture into [[bankruptcy]] in 2004.<ref>[http://ds.dial.pipex.com/steam/africa.htm Steam in Africa 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://worldrailfans.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4492&sid=89f419208b79f0cabe1470de407b7322</ref><ref>http://www.themercury.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3435966</ref>

==Banana Express==
After termination of the PSACR lease, [http://www.futurenet.co.za/pcngr Patons County Narrow Gauge Railway (PCNGR)] was granted a temporary permit to continue running the Banana Express, from Port Shepstone to Paddock. The company had three locomotives available to it (NGG16's No.151 and 127; plus an ex-sugar estate 0-4-0T, SAR NG UVE2.<ref name="Pipex">http://ds.dial.pipex.com/steam/africa.htm</ref>

With a 6 hour journey totally devoted to tourism and enabling access to locally based attractions and businesses,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandstone-estates.com/heritage/publications/shp1.htm|title=Banana Express tour|publisher=[[Sandstone Estates]]|accessdate=2009-07-10}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> it again became very popular with tourists because of both the scenery and the access to local businesses.

Before reaching Shelley Beach the railway traversed several river bridges along the [[Hibiscus Coast]]. The train then veered inland and chugged up through banana plantations and cane fields towards Izotsha (stopping for 1.5hrs), passed through lush sub-tropical indigenous forests and rondavel-dotted hillsides, before stopping over in Paddock for lunch (1.25hours), and then the direct return journey.

Although PCNGR had proposals to reopened the line to Harding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futurenet.co.za/pcngr/bannexprop.htm|title=Banana Express|publisher=futurenet.co.za|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref> in December 2005 Transnet shut the Banana Express, after they decreed a lease did not exist between SAR and PCNGR.<ref>http://www.ngdiscussion.net/cgi-bin/NGDFcook.pl?noframes;read=86030</ref>

On June 18, 2008 a huge storm hit the coast, which resulted in large amounts of [[flash flood]]ing. This damaged many of the railways bridges along the Hibiscus Coast beyond economic repair, and washed most of the Izotsha rail bridge away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosouthcoast.co.za/adventure/38-adventure/115-banana-express|title=Banana Express |publisher=SouthCoast.co.za|accessdate=2009-07-10}}</ref>

This extensive damage means that both the Banana Express and ACR are unlikely to return in the near future, if at all.
