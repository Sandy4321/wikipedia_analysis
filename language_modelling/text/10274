The '''National Festival of Polish Song in Opole''' ({{lang-pl|Krajowy Festiwal Piosenki Polskiej w Opolu}}, KFPP) is an annual music festival in [[Opole]], [[Poland]]. Together with the [[Sopot Festival]] it is one of the two most important music festivals in Poland. The Opole Festival is meant as a summary of the past year's achievements by Polish song writers and performers. It is also the most important cultural event in [[Opole]], with a tradition going back 50 years. It usually takes place in late June, since 2011 lasting for two days (Friday and Saturday). During the KFPP both the hits of the past season and new debut songs are performed; there is also a tournament of performing debuts.

Established in 1963, its traditional patrons include [[Polskie Radio]] and [[Telewizja Polska]], as well as the Society of Friends of Opole. The only year the Festival did not take place was 1982, due to [[martial law in Poland]]. Since the 1980s it has included a [[rock music|rock]] section and since 2001 a [[hip-hop]] section. The awards granted at the festival are:
* ''Karolinka'' - the ''[[Anna Jantar]] Award'', for the winner of the ''Debiuty'' (''Debuts'') show,
* ''Grand Prix'' - the ''Karol Musio<U+0142> Award'', for the best premiered song, awarded by the jury,
* ''Kryszta<U+0142>owy Kamerton'' (''Crystal [[Tuning Fork]]''), for the best author/composer,
* ''Superjedynka'' (''Super One'') - since 2000, awarded in several categories (singer, song, band, pop album, rock album, hip-hop album, alternative album, videoclip, music event of the year).

The festival takes place at the ''Millennium Amphitheatre'' (''Amfiteatr Tysi<U+0105>clecia''), which was opened in June 1963, in time for the first festival. The amphitheatre was built on the initiative of Opole's mayor, Karol Musio<U+0142>, and designed by the architect Florian Jesionowski. It has become one of the symbols of the city of Opole, and it is located in the spot where an early Slavic settlement once stood. Well-preserved remnants of wooden houses and traces of pavements were discovered by archaeologists, who suggested opening a museum of ancient Opole on the spot. In the spring of 2011, the amphitheatre was remodelled, and its capacity was reduced from 4,800 to 3,653.
