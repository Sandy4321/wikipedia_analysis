'''''Edinorog''''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|<U+0415><U+0434><U+0438><U+043D><U+043E><U+0440><U+043E><U+0433>}}) was a {{sclass|Uragan|monitor|0}} [[Monitor (warship)|monitor]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in the mid-1860s. The design was based on the American {{sclass-|Passaic|monitor|2}}, but was modified to suit Russian engines, guns and construction techniques. Spending her entire career with the [[Baltic Fleet]], the ship was only active when the [[Gulf of Finland]] was not frozen, but very little is known about her service. She was struck from the [[Navy List]] in 1900, converted into a storage [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] for [[naval mine|mines]] in 1912 and renamed ''Blokshiv No. 4''. The ship survived [[World War II]] and was stricken in 1957, although her ultimate fate is unknown.

==Description==
''Edinorog'' was {{convert|201|ft|m|1}} [[length overall|long overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|46|ft|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.16|-|10.84|ft|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|1500|-|1600|LT|t}}, and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865. They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877.<ref name=m3>McLaughlin, p. 103</ref>

The ship was fitted with a two-cylinder, horizontal [[Marine_steam_engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engine]]<ref name=m3/> built by the [[Charles Baird (engineer)|Baird Works]] of [[Saint Petersburg]]. It drove a single propeller<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 106<U+2013>07</ref> using steam that was provided by two rectangular [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.<ref>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 175</ref> Specific information on the output of the ship's engine has not survived, but it ranged between {{convert|340|-|500|ihp|0|lk=in}} for all the ships of this [[ship class|class]]. During ''Edinorog''{{'}}s [[sea trial]]s on 19 June 1865, she reached a maximum speed of {{convert|5.75|kn|lk=in}}, the slowest ship in the class. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|190|LT|t}} of coal, which gave her a theoretical endurance of {{convert|1440|nmi|lk=in|abbr=on}} at {{convert|6|kn}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 107</ref>

''Edinorog'' was designed to be armed with a pair of {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[smoothbore]] [[Muzzleloader|muzzle-loading guns]] purchased from [[Krupp]] of Germany and [[Rifling|rifled]] in Russia, but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine-inch smoothbores. These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license-built {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} smoothbore muzzle-loading [[Rodman gun]]s in 1867<U+2013>68. The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine-inch rifled guns.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 104<U+2013>05</ref>

All of the wrought-iron armor that was used in the ''Uragan''-class monitors was in {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} plates, just as in the ''Passaic''-class ships. The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates, of which the three innermost plates extended {{convert|42|in|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. This armor was backed by a wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of {{convert|36|in|0}}. The [[gun turret]] was protected by eleven layers of armor and the [[pilothouse]] above it had eight layers of armor. Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the [[funnel (ship)|funnel]] up to a height of {{convert|7|ft|m|1}} above the deck. Unlike their predecessors, the ''Uragan''s were built without deck armor to save weight, but ''Edinorog'' was modified for the addition of {{convert|0.5|in|1|adj=on}} armor plates after completion, but it is unknown if they were ever fitted. They were, however, manufactured and then placed in storage.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 105<U+2013>06</ref>

==Career==
Construction of the ship began on 13 June 1863 by S. G. Kudriavtsev at the state-owned [[Admiralty Shipyard|Galeryni Island Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. ''Edinorog'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 1 December 1863 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2 June 1864. She entered service on 27 July 1865 and cost a total of 1,141,800 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], almost double her contract cost of 600,000 rubles. The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she, and all of her [[sister ship]]s except {{ship|Russian monitor|Latnik||2}}, made a port visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden in July<U+2013>August 1865 while under the command of [[General Admiral]] [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich]].<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 100, 104, 109</ref>

Sometime after ''Edinorog'' was completed, an armored ring, {{convert|5|in|0}} thick and {{convert|15|in|0}} tall, was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it. Later, an armored, outward-curving [[wikt:bulwark|bulwark]] was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there. Three [[sponson]]s were later added, probably during the 1870s, to the upper portion of the turret. Each sponson, one above the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] and one on each side of the turret, mounted a light gun, probably a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on}} [[Engstrem gun]], for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a [[Deck (ship)#Hurricane deck|hurricane deck]] was built between the funnel and the turret, also probably during the 1870s.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 108</ref>

Little is known about the ship's career other than that she was [[Ship decommissioning|laid up]] each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze. ''Edinorog'' was reclassified as a [[coastal defense ship|coast defense]] [[ironclad]] on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of [[Kronstadt]] for disposal on 6 July 1900, although she was not stricken until 17 August. The ship was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1912 and renamed ''Blokshiv No. 4'' on 10 July of that year. She was abandoned by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in Helsingfors (Helsinki) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but she was later returned by the Finns. The ship was redesignated as ''Blokshiv No. 2'' on 1 January 1932 and survived World War II to be renamed ''BSh-2'' on 16 May 1949. She was stricken on 27 June 1957 and turned over to the [[Kronstadt]] [[Yacht Club]]. Her ultimate fate is unknown.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 109<U+2013>10</ref>
