'''''Braid''''' is a [[Platform game|platform]]/[[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] [[video game]] developed by independent software developer [[Jonathan Blow]] for the [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service and for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] systems. The game was officially announced for Xbox Live Arcade during Microsoft's [[Tokyo Game Show]] 2007 press conference and was released on August 6, 2008. It will be released for Microsoft Windows through [[Stardock]]'s [[Impulse (content delivery)|Impulse]] and [[Valve Software|Valve]]'s [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] service on March 31, 2009.{{update after|2009|03|31reason=Game should be released by now}} [[Hothead Games]] will assist in porting the game to the Macintosh platform.

''Braid'' tells the story of Tim, the [[protagonist]], attempting to rescue his princess, and has many allusions and interpretations. While the game features traditional aspects of platform games, it incorporates a number of time manipulation features, requiring the player to use these abilities to collect keys to complete each level and puzzle pieces to fully complete the story. Developed over a course of three years on his own money, Blow designed the game to reflect on much of the current trends he favored and disliked in current game design efforts. Artwork for the game was drawn by David Hellman, with the graphics iterated several times to achieved Blow's desired vision for the game.

A preliminary version of ''Braid'' without the final artwork won the "Innovation in Game Design" award at the [[Independent Games Festival]] in 2006, while the final version received additional accolades. Its release on Xbox Live was very positive and merited some of the highest review scores for any downloadable title on the service at the time it was released, despite its high price point and short length.

==Gameplay==
''Braid'' is played by solving physical puzzles in a standard [[platform game]] environment similar to that of ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' with jumping and enemies, and the player may also need to collect keys to unlock doors or operate levels to trigger platforms. One of the fundamental game elements is the player's unlimited ability to reverse time and "rewind" one's actions, even after dying. The game is divided into seven worlds, and an "overworld" in the form of the main character's house. The worlds are entered through doors in the house. Each world has its own time-based game mechanic:<ref name="ncn-preview">{{cite web|url=http://www.northcountrynotes.org/jason-rohrer/arthouseGames/seedBlogs.php?action=display_post&post_id=jcr13_1170707395_0&show_author=1&show_date=1|title=Exclusive Preview: Braid|first = Jason | last = Rohrer | publisher = Arthouse Games | date=2007-02-07 | accessdate=2008-08-11}}</ref><ref name="eurogamer review"/>
[[File:Braid-dk.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot from ''Braid'', showing a homage to ''[[Donkey Kong]]'']]

*''Time and Forgiveness'' plays as an ordinary platform game, except that the player may rewind time to undo their actions. The section includes several challenges that would be unplayable or unfair in an ordinary platform game, but become trivial when the rewind mechanic is available. As such, it has been interpreted as an oblique ironic comment about traditional platform game design.<ref name="ncn-preview"/>
*''Time and Mystery'' contains objects which appear that are unaffected by rewinding. Rewinding can thus be used to change the synchronization between objects that can and cannot be rewound, which is the basis of many puzzles in this section.
*''Time and Place'' has time linked to the player character's location on the level. As the player moves toward the right, time flows forward; when moving toward the left, time flows in reverse, standing still will pause time. This sets up a large number of complex correspondences that must be managed.
*''Time and Decision'' involves a "shadow" of the player character appearing after the player rewinds time and performing the actions that the real player character rewound. Puzzles in this section revolve around using this mechanic to carry out multiple actions at once.
*''Hesitance'' provides the player with a magic ring which, when dropped, warps the flow of time around itself; the closer moving objects (including Tim) are to it, the slower time passes for them. The regular rewind control remains available.
*The final world is untitled, but the number one appears in the main room of the world in place of the title. In this world time flows in reverse. Rewinding time returns the flow of time to its normal state.

Several worlds feature objects or enemies that are outlined in green; these objects do not follow the same mechanics as the rest of the world and remain in a persistent state as seen by the player. For example, a door marked in green will remain unlocked even if the player rewinds time to before he had unlocked it.<ref name="gamespot review"/>

Each stage contains puzzle pieces that must be collected to create [[jigsaw puzzles]] that tell the story, as well as to unlock the last stage.<Ref name="eurogamer review"/><ref name="gamespot review"/> On completing the main game, a [[speedrun]] mode becomes available.<ref name="ign review"/> There are also eight stars hidden throughout the world of ''Braid'' that correspond to the stars in the constellation of [[Andromeda_(constellation)|Andromeda]] just outside the main character's house.

The game pays homage to other video games; one level features a ''[[Donkey Kong]]''-inspired puzzle, while the ending of one world tells the player that "the princess is in another castle", similar to the end of each level of ''Super Mario Bros.''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamedaily.com/games/braid/xbox-360/game-reviews/review/7542/2092/ | title = Braid weaves a fantastic tale for Xbox Live Arcade subscribers. | first = Robert | last = Workman | date = 2008-08-06 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 | publisher = Game Daily}}</ref><ref name="eurogamer review"/>

==Plot==
''Braid'' features Tim, a man searching for a princess who "has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster".<ref name="oxm story"/> His relationship with this princess is vague at best, and the only clear part of this relationship is that Tim has made some sort of mistake which he hopes to reconcile or, if possible, erase. As one progresses through the six worlds in ''Braid'', storyline text at the beginning of each world provides further insight into Tim's quest for his princess. The themes evoked include forgiveness, desire, and frustration.<ref name="oxm story"/>

In the final level, in which the player moves Tim in "forward" time while the rest of the world moves backwards in time, the events depict the princess escaping from a knight, and then Tim and the princess working together to surpass obstacles and meet at her home.  However, when played in reverse, the events show the princess running from Tim, setting traps that he is able to evade, until she is rescued by the knight.<ref name="oxm story"/>

Following completion of the game, the player will find additional texts that expand upon the story. The ending of the game is ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations.<ref name="oxm story">{{cite web| title = Braid's Ending Explained| publisher = ''Official Xbox Magazine (UK)''| date = 2008-08-12| url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/article.php?id=5666}}</ref>  One common theory, based on the inclusion of the famous quote stated by [[Kenneth Bainbridge]]<U+2014>"Now we are all sons of bitches"<U+2014>after [[Trinity (nuclear test)|the detonation of the first atomic bomb]], suggests that the princess represents the atomic bomb,<ref name="oxm story"/> though Blow has stated that there is more than just this interpretation of the story.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.podtoid.com/podtoid-66-braidtoid/ | title = Podtoid 66: Braidtoid | date = 2008-08-21 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 | publisher = Destructoid}}</ref> Blow has also said that he "would not be capable" of explaining the whole story of the game, and stated that the central idea is "something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.joystiq.com/2008/09/25/joystiq-interview-blow-unravels-braid-in-post-mortem/ | title = Joystiq interview: Blow unravels Braid in postmortem | publisher = [[Joystiq]] | first = Justin | last = McElroy | date = 2008-09-25 | accessdate = 2009-02-18}}</ref>

==Development==
[[File:Jonathan Blow.jpg|right|thumb|Jonathan Blow, the creative mind behind ''Braid'']]
[[Jonathan Blow]] came up with the concept of ''Braid'' in December 2004, inspired while on a trip to [[Thailand]], and started development work on it in April of the following year.<ref name="mtv interview">{{cite web | url =  http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/08/08/a-higher-standard-game-designer-jonathan-blow-challenges-super-marios-gold-coins-unethical-mmo-design-and-everything-else-you-may-hold-dear-about-video-games/ | title = <U+201C>A Higher Standard<U+201D> <U+2014> Game Designer Jonathan Blow Challenges Super Mario<U+2019>s Gold Coins, <U+201C>Unethical<U+201D> MMO Design And Everything Else You May Hold Dear About Video Games | publisher = [[MTV]] | first = Stephen | last = Torilo | date = 2007-08-08 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref> By December 2005, a version of the game with the same worlds and puzzles as the final version but without the final artwork was completed; this version won the [[Independent Games Festival]] game design award at the 2006 [[Game Developer's Conference]].<ref name="mtv interview"/> While working on the art direction, Blow improved on the puzzles in the game to make sure they could play better.<ref name="mtv interview"/> During the game's three years of development, Blow put over {{USD|180,000}} of his own money into its development.<ref name="wsj cost">{{cite web| title = Video Games: Braid - Advisor| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB121814539048522033.html |first= Jamin | last =  Brophy-Warren | accessdate = 2009-02-19| date=2008-08-08 | publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}</ref>

Originally, Blow had envisioned the game to be broken into several different worlds as in the final game, each exploring facets of space, time, and causality, but with each world having very different high-level mechanics. One mechanic that Blow could not develop further was a world with no "arrow of time", requiring the player to get from one end of a level to another in a way which would allow them to retrace their steps back, making things such as a drop from a height higher than what the player could jump would be impossible.<ref name="mtv interview"/> While this idea was not used, Blow discovered the rewind feature could be developed further for other aspects.<ref name="mtv interview"/> Blow then began adding puzzles that made philosophical points on game design in general, and resulted in dropping some worlds that were not as interesting as the remaining levels in the game.<ref name="mtv interview"/> Blow noted he wanted to include consequences of rewinding time, features not found in games that have such an aspect such as ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', ''[[Blinx: the Time Sweeper]]'', and ''[[Timeshift]]''.<ref name="mtv interview"/>  Blow also specifically avoided using a first- or third-person view for the game like these other title had done as, despite the fact that the time effects are better experienced from those perspectives, some of the puzzles in ''Braid'' would have been impossible or more difficult in any other perspective.<ref name="mtv interview"/> 

One of Jonathan Blow's design factors into ''Braid'' was to achieve gameplay innovation naturally through the artistic expression of the game. Blow used [[Rod Humble]]'s ''The Marriage'' as an example, in which Humble set out to make a game that related his feelings of being in a marriage, instead of developing game concepts first and adding the story later.  As such, Blow noted that while there were no new gameplay mechanics, "it doesn't play like any game you've ever played".<ref name="blow innovation"/><ref name="gamasutra interview"/> Another concept that Blow used for ''Braid''{{'}}s development was related to the game's presentation to the player. Blow recognized that many games present a complex interface to the player that get in the way of understanding the game, but at times are needed in order to explain the rules and concept of the game in order to draw in players. Blow referenced [[Jeff Minter]]'s ''[[Space Giraffe]]'', pointing out that the game never communicated the purpose of playing the game upfront to the player, citing that as one of the reasons for the game's poor reception.<ref name="blow innovation">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameculture.com/node/690 | title = Jonathan Blow on Innovation, Making a Living as an Indie Game Designer, How Game Design is Changing and His Future Projects | date = 2008-08-14 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 | publisher = GameCulture }}</ref> ''Braid'' was developed to promote this communication early on in each world, explaining the fundamental rule of each world at the start as to then allow the player to interact with that rule throughout the world.<ref name="blow innovation"/>

Blow recognized that the puzzles in ''Braid'' had a range of difficulties, with some puzzles being more difficult for certain players than others, and did not have any set [[learning curve|difficulty curve]].<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> To allow players to continue to experience the rest of the game without having to solve a difficult puzzle, Blow designed most of the game's levels to let the player bypass the puzzles. Only certain [[boss fight|boss]] characters require the player to defeat the boss before continuing on. In this manner, Blow believed players may solve later puzzles and recognize from those solutions how to solve the previously passed puzzles.<ref name="gamasutra interview"/> Blow felt that "unearned rewards are false and meaningless", and thus included the gameplay mechanic of earning a collectible only after solving a puzzle, and only one collectible would be earned per puzzle.<ref name="mtv interview"/>

The game's story is influenced by such works as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[Invisible Cities]]'', [[Alan Lightman]]'s ''[[Einstein's Dreams]]'', [[Robert Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'', and [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref name="mtv interview"/><ref name="gamasutra interview">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3786/jonathan_blow_the_path_to_braid.php?page=3 | title = 
Jonathan Blow: The Path to Braid | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2008-09-12 | first = Simon | last = Parkin | accessdate = 2009-02-19}}</ref> Specifically, while Blow took the model of ''Invisible Cities'', he did not like the homage to it taken by ''Einstein's Dreams'', and thus avoided taking the story in that direction.<ref name="mtv interview"/>  Blow's goal was to have ''Braid'' "be mind-expanding" and to have "people to get experiences from it that they have not gotten from anything else".<ref name="mtv interview"/>

The art for the game took more than a year to complete.<ref name="mtv interview"/> Background artwork for the game was created by David Hellman, artist of the critically-acclaimed webcomic ''[[A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible]]''.  To create the art, Blow gave Hellman rough images of the level's layout, and told him to draw over it.<ref name="art of braid">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3753/the_art_of_braid_creating_a_.php?page=1 | first = David | last = Hellman | date = 2008-08-05 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | title = The Art Of Braid: Creating A Visual Identity For An Unusual Game }}</ref> Hellman and Blow iterated through several styles before achieving the final versions. Through these iterations, the two worked to identify elements of the art that could be seen as aesthetic and confuse the player, while still retaining aesthetic elements that would be generalized by the player as non-functional parts of the level.<ref name="art of braid"/>  Once the game's overall artwork was created, Blow and Hellman worked to break out functional pieces that could be used in ''Braid''{{'}}s level editor, further refining the art to reflect the tone of each world, and making sure that the art did not distract from the gameplay. For example, "Time and Forgiveness", the first world the player encounters, is drawn to create a feel of exploration and forgiveness,<ref name="art of braid"/> while artwork for "Time and Decision" uses a mix of "luxurious domestic objects (nice furniture and fabrics) with rugged outdoor objects (swampy water, rotting piers and nautical rope)" to create an intentionally "incongruous" look to match the gameplay aspects of alternate realities.<ref name="david hellman net"/> Several variations on the game's backgrounds were done until they arrived at the concept of blurring the background elements to make them appear out of focus, allowing the foreground elements to remain sharply in focus and clear to the player.<ref name="art of braid"/> [[Particle effect]]s were applied to both background and foreground elements to add apparent motion to them, such as the waving of grass blades or the motion of clouds.<ref name="art of braid"/> The character visuals were originally created by Edmund McMillen, but were later redrawn by Hellman "to better match the now-predominant style of the backgrounds".<ref name="david hellman net"> {{cite web | first = David | last = Hellman | title = Braid| url = http://www.davidhellman.net/braid.htm| accessdate = 2008-06-30}}</ref>

''Braid'' features licensed music from [[Magnatune]] artists [[Cheryl Ann Fulton]], Shira Kammen and Jami Sieber.<ref name="soundtrack">{{cite web | url=http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/2008/08/braid-video-gam.html | title=Braid video game launches to acclaim with Magnatune music | accessdate=2008-08-10 | date=2008-08-06 |publisher=[[Magnatune]]}}</ref>

''Braid'' was originally developed as a PC title with possible console versions.<ref name="mtv interview"/> The Xbox Live version was announced at the 2007 [[Tokyo Game Show]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=15468 | title = Microsoft Unveils Ninja Gaiden II, Rez HD In Japan | first = David | last = Jenkins | date = 2007-09-12 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>  However, Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game; however, at the same time, the certification team allows Blow to retain certain aspects, such as immediately placing the player in control of the game, in order to retain his vision for the game.<ref name="xbox live issues">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19748 | title = Blow: 'Unnecessary' XBLA Hurdles Hurt Game Quality | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date =2008-08-08 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 | first = Simon | last = Parkin | coauthor= Alexander, Leigh}}</ref>  Regardless, Blow stated he would likely not release a game again on the service under the same business model.<ref name="xbox live issues"/>  The PC version was original slated for a late 2008 release but, due to other factors, had slipped to at least October 2008. Blow decided to prevent ''Braid'' being overwhelmed by a number of large titles that were scheduled for release in late 2008 and pushed the release to early 2009.<ref name="pc delay">{{cite web | url = http://braid-game.com/news/?p=392 | title = Braid PC Release | date = 2008-12-22 | accessdate= 2009-02-21 | first = Jonathan | last = Blow | publisher = Braid-game.com}}</ref> Prior to the game's release for Microsoft Windows, Blow had priced the game at {{USD|20}}, using pricing models for other games such as ''[[World of Goo]]'' and ''[[Crayon Physics Deluxe]]''.  However, this was priced $5 more than the Xbox Live version, leading many to criticize his pricing choice.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/89542-Braid-Creator-Responds-To-PC-Pricing-Questions | title = Braid Creator Responds To PC Pricing Questions | publisher = [[The Escapist]] | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = 2009-02-18 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 }}</ref> Due to this response, Blow reduced the price to meet the Xbox Live cost, stating that he would "rather have people talking about the game itself" than complaining about its cost.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/57301 | title = Internet Whining Leads to Lower Braid PC Price | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date = 2009-02-18 | accessdate = 2009-02-18 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}</ref> Blow said that a [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game "might happen in the future", but a [[WiiWare]] version would not be possible under Nintendo's current size restrictions.<ref name="eurogamerrev">{{cite web| title = Braid for PS3 is a possibility | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=211849 |accessdate = 2008-08-13|date=2008-08-11|publisher=[[Eurogamer]] | first = Tom | last = Bramwell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=195047|title=A PS3 version "might happen in the future", says creator|last=Jackson|first=Mike |date=2008-08-12 |publisher=Computer and Video Games|language=English|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2008/08/12/braid-on-ps3-a-possibility-wii-not-so-much|title=Braid on PS3 a possibility, Wii not so much|last=Webster|first=Andrew |date=2008-08-12 | publisher = [[Ars Technica]] | language=English|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> [[Hothead Games]] will port ''Braid'' to the [[Macintosh]] platform.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/5159466/hothead-brings-braid-to-mac-the-maw-to-windows|title= Hothead Brings Braid To Mac, The Maw To Windows | publusher = [[Kotaku]] | first = Mike | last =  Fahey | date = 2009-02-24| accessdate = 2009-02-24 }}</ref>

Blow has expressed that he has no current plans to either release more levels or make a sequel. However he specified that "If another developer out there really likes the time mechanics and wants to make a game that uses them, and perhaps some new ones, with their own new level designs, then hey, awesome".<ref name="sequel">{{cite web | url=http://braid-game.com/news/?p=301#comment-2465 | title=Creator has no plans for sequel | accessdate=2008-08-11 | date=2008-08-11 |first=Jonathan | last = Blow | publisher = Braid-Game.com }}</ref>

Despite being one of six finalists for the 2007 [[Slamdance Film Festival#Slamdance Guerilla Games Competition|Slamdance Guerrila Games Competition]], Blow withdrew ''Braid'' in protest of the controversial ''[[Super Columbine Massacre RPG!]]'' being dropped from the competition.<ref name="game withdrawals">{{cite web |url=http://gamepolitics.com/2007/01/07/developer-pulls-out-of-festival-competition-in-protest-over-super-columbine-decision/ |title=Developer Pulls Out of Festival Competition in Protest over Super Columbine Decision |last=McCauley |first=Dennis | date=[[2007-01-07]] |publisher=[[GamePolitics.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12323 | title = Developers Leave Slamdance Following Columbine Controversy | date = 2007-01-08 | accessdate =2009-02-19 | first = Brandon | last = Boyer | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}</ref> Several other developers followed suit and later withdrew their games, including [[thatgamecompany]]'s ''[[flOw]]'' and [[The Behemoth]]'s ''[[Castle Crashers]]''.<ref name="game withdrawals"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/op-ed/851-Welcome-to-The-Escapist-First-Annual-Slammy-Awards | title = Welcome to The Escapist First Annual Slammy Awards... | publisher = [[The Escapist]] | first = Howard | last = Wen | date= 2007-01-30 | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}</ref>

''Braid'' was highly praised for the unique puzzles it presented.  Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] noted the creative variation on time manipulation used in the game and the need to understand the non-linearity of his actions made him feel as if "years of gaming blinkers have been ripped away."<ref name="eurogamer review"/> Furthermore, the connection between the puzzles and the overall presence of the game was favorably received; Tom McShea of [[Gamespot]] stated that ''Braid'' was "the rare game that will make you rack your brain trying to solve puzzles one minute while challenging you to come to terms with its mature tale the next".<ref name="gamespot review"/> ''Braid''{{'}}s artwork and presentation were giving high regards.  Nick Suttner of [[1UP.com]] commented that ''Braid''{{'}}s artwork "juxtapose old-school design sensibilities with impressionist backdrops and lovingly hand-painted environments",<ref name="1up review"/> while [[GameSpot]]'s McShea stated that the game's visuals were "eye-catching but never distracting".<ref name="gamespot review"/> Jean Snow of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' stated that ''Braid''{{'}}s "beautiful symphonic melodies contribute to what is already an impressive and unique vision", and that "the soothing tunes are probably the reason you never really lose it when facing particularly tough puzzles".<ref name="wired review">{{cite web | url = http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/08/review-braid-in.html | title = Review: Braid Innovates and Satisfies | first = Jean | last = Snow | publisher = ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' | date = 2008-08-13 | accessdate =2009-02-20}}</ref>

The game was primarily criticized for its short length. Hilary Goldstein in her [[IGN]] review stated that the game offers "no reason to come back" once you've completed all the puzzles.<ref name="ign review"/> However, others compared ''Braid''{{'}}s short experience to similar criticisms with ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'' in that its length "can be disregarded in the face of its unique approach to storytelling and expansive ideas".<ref name="1up review"/> The game's high price was also seen as a negative for the game, though reviews did state that "Braid is worth every penny".<ref name="gamespot review"/>

In addition to winning the Independent Games Festival award in 2006 during its design, ''Braid'' was selected by [[GameSpot]] for their 2008 awards in "Best Original Downloadable Console Game",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/best-of/special-achievement/index.html?page=9|title=GameSpot's Best Games of 2008: Best Original Downloadable Console Game|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref> "Best Platformer",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/best-of/genre-awards/index.html?page=5|title=GameSpot's Best Games of 2008: Best Platformer|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref> and "Best Licensed Music",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/best-of/special-achievement/index.html?page=14|title=GameSpot's Best Games of 2008: Best Licensed Music|publisher=GameSpot|accessdate=2008-12-25}}</ref> and by [[Official Xbox Magazine]] for their 2008 awards of "XBox Live Arcade Game of the Year", "Best Soundtrack", and "Best Ending" and one of their "Indisputably Incredible Runners-ups to Game of the Year".<ref>{{cite news | title = The 2008 Official Xbox Magazine Game of the Year Awards | publisher =  ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' #93 | date = February 2009}}</ref> ''Braid'' was awarded the "Casual Game of the Year" at the 12th Annual [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences]] Awards.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22406 | title = LittleBigPlanet Dominates At AIAS Awards | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2009-02-20 | accessdate = 2009-02-20 |first = David | last = Jenkins }}</ref>
