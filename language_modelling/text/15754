{{About|a First Nation located in southwestern Ontario|the First Nation located in northwestern Ontario|Ojibway Nation of Saugeen First Nation}}
'''Saugeen First Nation''' is an [[Ojibwa]]y [[First Nation]] located along the [[Saugeen River]] and [[Bruce Peninsula]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Organized in the mid 1970s, Saugeen First Nation is the primary political Successor Inherent to the [[Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory]].

==History==
{{main|Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory}}
===Origins===
The original people of Saugeen are Ojibway. They became known as Chippewa by people who could not pronounce the word Ojibway. Chippewas of Saugeen is the legal name of the community.

Like other Aboriginal people in Canada, in the early 1970s the Chippewas of Saugeen began referring to their community as a "First Nation".

Archaeological evidence proves all of the modern [[Bruce Peninsula]] (or the "Saugeen Peninsula" as referred to by the Ojibway) was home to the Chippewas of Saugeen. From time immemorial, hunting and fishing were plentiful in this area. Archaeologists are able to find artifacts from Early [[Woodland Period]] (1000 BCE to 1000 CE), calling the culture that left artifacts in the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory as the [[Saugeen Complex]]. Other than pottery, the projectile points called [[Saugeen Point]] are typical characteristics of the Saugeen culture. Consequently, associated with both the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory and the Saugeen Culture peoples were winter camps around [[Owen Sound, Ontario|Owen Sound]], [[Cape Croker, Ontario|Cape Croker]] and the [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]] area, as well as summer camps in [[Walkerton, Ontario|Walkerton]], [[Wiarton, Ontario|Wiarton]], [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]], [[Tobermory, Ontario|Tobermory]] and [[Red Bay, Ontario|Red Bay]]. Traditional territory also included all of the [[Saugeen River, Ontario|Saugeen River]] watershed. Thus, places such as Tobermory, [[Meaford, Ontario|Meaford]], Goderich, Cape Croker, Owen Sound and [[Orangeville, Ontario|Orangeville]] are located in the traditional Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The permanent settlement at the outlet of the [[Saugeen River, Ontario|Saugeen River]] which lent its name to the region and its people was called ''Zaageeng'', meaning "mouth of river."

The Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway are a member of the [[Council of Three Fires]] of the Ojibway, [[Odawa]] and [[Pottawatomi]] Nations. The Confederacy came to help in the [[Battle of Skull Mound]] and in the [[Battle of Blue Mountain]].  

The [[Wyandot|Wyandotte/Wendat]] Nation also made the area their home as did the Petun or Tobacco people.  

Four of Seven major [[Ojibwa#Clans|clans]] or ''doodem'' are found among the Chippewas of Saugeen.

One of the earliest documents recognizing Nation to Nation relations between [[the Crown]] and Indigenous peoples, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] stated "Indian land" could only be sold to the Crown.

People from many nations moved into Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory after the [[War of 1812]]. They came from [[Ohio]] and from the [[US State|State]] of [[New York]]. As a result of the [[Indian Removal Act|American Indian Removal Policies]] of the 1830s more people came from [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]]. Some were on their way to the [[Manitoulin Island]] project. Some moved from [[Severn, Ontario|Coldwater]] on the Narrows. Others came from the [[Toronto]] and [[Niagara Peninsula|Niagara]] regions after newcomers affected their territory. Due to these influxes of people from other areas, the history of the Chippewas of Saugeen is often confused others who settled in Ojibway Territory after the American Revolution; often confused together are the history of those who settled in [[Cape Croker, Ontario|Cape Croker]] in 1854 with the history of the Chippewas of Saugeen.

===Canada's Biggest Land Grab===

Within 50 years of the Royal Proclamation the [[Upper Canada]] and its partners wanted the surrounding Indian lands, including the Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The Army, Indian Affairs and Missionaries were aided by some Aboriginal people from other parts of Canada in the, <U+201C>surrender<U+201D> of the Saugeen territory.

Sir Francis Bond Head, represented the Government of Upper Canada, T.G. Anderson signed on behalf of Indian Affairs, J. Stinson signed for Wesley Missions, and F.L. Ingall represented the 15th Regiment of the Army. Three other non-native men witnessed the signing. And four <U+201C>Indian<U+201D> men who were not Chiefs or Head Men of Saugeen signed by their ''doodem'' and agreed to: <U+201C>surrender Sauking Territory<U+201D> and to <U+201C>repair to (Manitoulin) island or to the territory north of Owen Sound.<U+201D>  They were: Mettiewabe, Kaquta Bunevairear, Kowgiswasis and Mettawansh.

The original people of Saugeen never surrendered or signed away their land or water. 

In 1834 some people attempted to surrender Saugeen<U+2019>s Fishing Islands by leasing them to the Huron Fishing Company. But [[Jacob Metigwob]] was from Manitoulin Island, [[John Ansance]] was from Christian Island and the Matweyosh families came from the [[Caldwell Band]] of the [[Chippewas of Point Pelee]].

Around that time, the provincial government wanted all [[Anishnabek]] people to agree to surrender their traditional territory and move to Manitoulin Island. And, many people from the [[Coldwater, Ontario|Coldwater]] and Point Pelee area sought shelter in Saugeen territory after other events and other people moved into their homeland.

According to some people the Chief of the Saugeen Ojibway at the time of Saugeen Tract Agreement was Wahbahdick.

Chief Wahbahdick<U+2019>s name or doodem is not on Saugeen Tract Agreement.

According to our stories the last traditional Chief was John Kedugegwan/Kewaquom. A memorial in the cemetery at Chippewa Hill records John Kedugegwan as the last hereditary Chief of Saugeen.

===Surrenders and new settlements===

[[Peter Jones (missionary)|Peter Jones]] b. January 1, 1802-d.1856, was a [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] from the [[Credit River, Ontario|Credit River]]. He was also a [[Methodist]] Missionary. To the Ojibway he became known as: Kahkewaquonaby or Sacred Waving Feathers and refers to the feathers taken from the eagle.  

The Kewaquom name is from an original family of the Saugeen Territory. It is associated with the sound Thunder Going Home. They are of the Eagle clan. Peter Jones said, that by "taking this name I was dedicated to the Thunder God." Thunder birds are represented by eagles. Eagle feathers are used in all sacred Ojibwe ceremonies.

Peter Jones was the son of a Welsh Surveyor, [[Augustus Jones]] and Tuhbenahneequay, the daughter of Head [[Chief Wahbansay]]. His niece [[Nahnebahwequa]] or Catherine and her husband William Sutton traveled with him to Saugeen Territory and also lived at the Ojibway camp at Owen Sound. They went to [[England]] to solicit funds for their missionary work. Catherine Sutton is also reported to have met with [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] to ask for compensation for her property. He married an Englishwoman, Eliza Field and had five children.

Peter Jones baptized [[Chief Kegedonce]]. Kegedonce was the Chief of the Naguhweseebee-[[Ausable River (Ontario)|Ausable River]] which is by Port Franks, which is now known as the Pinery-Ipperwash area. Kegedonce took the Christian name Peter and became known as Peter Kegedonce Jones. He also told Peter Jones he would accept Christianity if [[Chief Wawanosh]] from Sarnia did. In the directory of First Nations Individuals in South Western Ontario 1750-1850, by Greg Curnoe,, Kegedonce is recorded as telling Rev. Peter Jones that he," wanted to settle at Saugeen" and accept presents at the mouth of the Red River-Goderich. 

Chief Kegedonce Jones was found murdered near Goderich in 1831. His wife and family moved to the Owen Sound village, "to escape Kegedonce's enemies" (Mullin 1997) His son Peter Kegedonce Jones would later become a Chief.

In compliance with their agreement, Indian Affairs built 8 houses. Thomas Anderson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs noted on November 6, 1845 that <U+201C>Four families from outside Saugeen Territory, two Michigan Pottawatomi and two from elsewhere in Canada occupied those houses.<U+201D>

[[Chief Wahbudick]] lived at the Owen Sound village of the Saugeen people when others sought shelter in our territory.

In the [[Imperial Proclamation of 1847]], which was signed at [[Montreal]] on June 29, 1847, the <U+201C>Trusty<U+201D> and, <U+201C>Well Beloved Cousin James, Earl of Elgin and Kincardine, <U+201C>witnessed the declaration of the <U+201C>Royal Will and Pleasure<U+201D> that <U+201C>no surrender shall be approved or acted upon, unless resolved on or approved at a meeting of Sachems, Chiefs or Principal Men.<U+201D>

On October 13, 1854, the church and the government gathered some men to place their name on their proposed surrender and division of more of the Saugeen territory.

===From traditional to an elected style of government===

Kezigkoenene (''Giizhigowinini'') or [[David Sawyer]] was the cousin of Peter Jones-Kahkewaquonaby and was from the Credit River. He was the son of Nawahjegezhewabe: [[Chief Joseph Sawyer]] b.1786, Genesee County, New York. Records in the Canadian Archives note that David Sawyer came to live with some of the people at the Owen Sound village which eventually became known as Nawash. It is recorded that the Nawash," on March 9, 1855, passed a resolution that David Sawyer replace Kegedonce as their chief and interpreter." David Sawyer attended the mission school taught by Peter Jones' brother: [[Thayendanega]] or John Jones. David Sawyer signed the treaty of 1854 to surrender most of Saugeen Territory. 

Records in [[Library and Archives Canada]] also state that,"when Sawyer was absent from the Owen Sound area in 1856, the Indian Department" secured the surrender" when, "a few Indians were invited to Toronto to sign a Treaty" where they surrendered the Owen Sound village, "including Sawyer's farm" and Catherine Sutton's new home.

[[Treaty No. 82]] was signed at [[Toronto]], February 9, 1857. It sold, <U+201C>the land upon which we now reside, commonly known as the [[Nawash]] or Owen Sound Reserve.<U+201D>

[[Treaty No. 93]], surrendered the area known as [[Colpoy<U+2019>s Bay]] of [[Saugeen]] Territory.

The 1851 census lists John Johnston as American Potawatomi. He signed the treaty of 1854.

In the Directory of First Nations Individuals in South-Western Ontario 1750-1850, Greg Curnoe records James Newash as an [[Odawa]]. He is reported to have moved to [[Saugeen]] after the war of 1812 and the Battle at Moraviantown. It is said that [[Nawash]] fought with [[Tecumseh]]. He settled with his community on the fighting islands of [[Detroit River]] around 1815 and moved to the [[Great Miami River|Miami River]] in 1819. James Newash also signed the [[Robinson Treaty#Lake Huron (2)|Treaty of 1854]] .

[[Charles Keeshig]] is recorded as being a very well educated Pottawatomi from the [[United States]] who worked as an interpreter in Saugeen Territory. He was the brother in law of Peter Jones Kegedonce. Peter Jones Kegedonce was the son of Kegedonce Chief of the Ausable River people by Kettle and Stony Point.

The Department of Indian Affairs replaced David Sawyer with Charles Keeshick as an agent for the people who became known as the Nawash of Owen Sound. Library and Archives Canada, notes that "during Keeshick's term of office the band ceded to the government in 1854, almost all of the Bruce Peninsula." He signed the Treaty of 1854.

The [[Robinson Treaty#Lake Huron (2)|Treaty of 1854]] was one of the biggest land grabs in history. It involved the surrender of 1.5 million acres (6070&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of the traditional territory of the Saugeen Ojibway. It is recorded as No.72 : Surrender of the Saugeen Peninsula.

The ''doodem'' of Chief Wahbudick appears on that treaty even though Thomas Anderson, as Superintendent of Indian Affairs removed him from official office as the Chief of the Saugeen Ojibway.

The time of surrenders and treaties was very difficult for the Saugeen Ojibway. Most could not read or write English and that was the language used to sign and record land surrenders and treaties.

It was also the time that people from other places allowed the Department of Indian Affairs into Saugeen Ojibway Territory to set up an elected form of government.

==Water Project==

Due to inadequate potable water supply to the First Nation, the Saugeen First Nation received a significant water and sewer improvement assistance of $14 million in the 2006-2007 fiscal year to provide the First Nation with clean treated drinking water. The new system consists of a connection to the [[Saugeen Shores, Ontario|town of Saugeen Shores]] municipal water supply system, construction of a pump house and above grade reservoir, a water distribution system, back-up electrical generating system, elevated storage reservoir  (water tower), and the decommissioning of six pump houses and associated small-diameter water mains.<ref>[http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ai/mr/nr/j-a2008/2-2986-bk-eng.asp INAC: "Backgrounder - FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN FIRST NATION WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS IN ONTARIO"]</ref> The drinking water is still treated in the Southampton's new [[Zenon Environmental]] Water Treatment Plant.

Also many residents are going back to the [[Midewiwin|Traditional ways]] or co-practising Traditional and Christian religions.

==Contemporary issues==
* Like Chief Wahbudick, many people of Saugeen still do not believe in surrendering their rights or the birthrights of their children.
* The original people of Saugeen still defend their territory.
* It is also important to remember where Kegedonce was found as [[Dudley George]] and other warriors defended traditional burial grounds by [[Ipperwash]]-[[Ausable River (Ontario)|Ausable River]].
* The [[Duluth Declaration]] of 1995 affirm Saugeen First Nation's jurisdiction over the waters around the Saugeen/Bruce Peninsula. Though a 1993 Canadian Federal Court decision declaring that the Ojibways' right to fish commercially takes precedence over any other activity, the [[Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources]] have attempted to impose an Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licence on the Saugeen First Nation, a direct assault on Tribal Sovereignty, which the Saugeen First Nation have never abrogated authority or relinquished it to any other entity.
* Since 1830 the people were influenced and their lives affected by newcomers to the Saugeen Territory. These influences include:
** Two-thirds of the current population of the Saugeen First Nation are not members of Saugeen. Many non-Native and Native people from other bands spouses of Saugeen-member enjoy housing through low interest loans, if the Band Member and Non Band Member divorce then the Band member will retain all property rights as Non band members cannot own property on reserve although they may lease the land. Leasing of land is usually only done on South Sauble Beach for cottages.
** Racial and Cultural make-up of the Saugeen population now consists of Black/Ojibway, Chinese/Ojibway, Scottish/Ojibway, Ukrainian/Ojibway, Jewish/Ojibway, Ojibway/Odawa, Ojibway/Oneida, Ojibway/French and Ojibway/Pottawatomi, to name only a few.

==Media==

The ''Saugeen News'', published by the band council, is a monthly newsletter sent out to all band members containing band member birthdays, events at the beach and information from community organizations such as the local Recreation Centre and the Mino Bimaadsawin Health Centre.

Saugeen First Nation has no commercial media of its own, although radio and television stations from [[Owen Sound, Ontario|Owen Sound]], [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]], [[Port Elgin, Ontario|Port Elgin]] and [[Kincardine, Ontario|Kincardine]] can be heard in the area. 

In print, the daily ''[[Owen Sound Sun Times]]'' and the weekly ''[[Shoreline Beacon]]'' from Port Elgin also serve the community.

Distant television signals from [[Michigan]] (particularly [[Detroit]], [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]]) can sometimes also be received in the area.
