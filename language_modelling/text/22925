'''Le Manoir du diable''' ([[French language|French]]: ''The House of the Devil'') is a two minute long [[Cinema of France|French]] [[film]] directed by [[Georges M<U+00E9>li<U+00E8>s]]. The film contained many traditional [[pantomime]] elements and was intentionally meant to amuse people, rather than frighten them. 
The film is often called other things by mistake, some of these include: 

* ''The Haunted Castle''
* ''The Devil's Manor''
* ''The Manor of the Devil''

It was released on [[Christmas Eve]], [[1896 in film|1896]], at the Theatre Robert Houdin, 8 boulevard des Italiens, [[Paris]]. It was from this two minute short that many assume the [[horror film]] was born.

== Plot Summary ==
{{spoiler}}
The film starts off with a large [[bat]] flying into a [[Medieval architecture|medieval]] [[castle]]. Once in, the bat circles slowly while flapping its monstrous wings before suddenly changing into [[Mephistopheles]]. After preparing a [[cauldron]], the demon produces [[Skeleton (undead)|skeletons]], [[Ghost#Ghosts in fiction|ghosts]], and [[witchcraft|witches]] from its bubbling contents before one of the summoned underworld cavaliers holds up a [[crucifix]] and [[Satan]] vanishes in a blast of smoke.
