'''Shoaib Akhtar''' ([[Urdu]]: <U+0634><U+0639><U+06CC><U+0628> <U+0627><U+062E><U+062A><U+0631>) (born [[13 August]] [[1975]] in [[Rawalpindi]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]) is a [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistani]] [[cricket]] player, widely recognized as one of the fastest bowlers in the world, earning him the name ''Rawalpindi Express''. He made a world record by clocking 100mph twice. His ability to bowl fast yorkers, well disguised slow balls, swinging deliveries, and sharp bouncers made him lethal even on dead pitches. In late 2006 he was embroiled in controversy when he failed a drugs test, the ramifications of which are still ongoing.  .<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/pakistan/6107256.stm</ref> 

==Early Years==
Shoaib Akhtar was born at Morgah, a small town near Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan. His father was a worker in Attock Oil Refinery, Morgah.Shoaib started his studies at Elliot High School, Morgah and then took admission in the Coolio College, Rawalpindi. There he was given the chance to show off his talent and consequently come into the limelight.

==Performances==
Akhtar's run of impressive performances started in 1999 in a pre-world cup series against India when he shot to prominence. It was followed by outstanding bowling displays in [[Sharjah]] and later in [[1999 Cricket World Cup]]. In 2002-03 he played leading roles in Pakistan's wins over South Africa and New Zealand in home and away series. Later in 2005 he fared a spirited bowling attack against Australia. The 2003 World Cup was a huge disappointment especially given the hype, after which he was dropped from the team. He came back in the team with a bang in the 2004 series against New Zealand, but struggled in a lost series against [[Indian cricket team|India]] in [[2004 in cricket|2004]]. The series ended with a controversy when he left the field citing an injury leading to suspicions by the captain, [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]], about his commitment. Resultantly his relationship with [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and the coach [[Bob Woolmer]] deteriorated. A medical panel set up by PCB to investigate the nature of his injury, however, dispelled all suspicions.<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/140776.html | title = Bone scan puts Akhtar in the clear | accessdate = 2006-04-10 }}</ref> 

In [[2005 in cricket|2005]], Akhtar regained his reputation as a potent bowler for his side. Playing in a three-[[Test cricket|Test]] home series against [[England cricket team]], he made a series of impressive bowling efforts on lifeless [[cricket pitch|pitches]]. His effective use of slower ball proved to be unplayable by English batsmen. He emerged as the highest wicket taker of the series with seventeen wickets. His performance was also acknowledged by the English captain [[Michael Vaughan]], who remarked "I thought he (Shoaib) was a big difference between the two teams".<ref>{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/228332.html | title = Vaughan - Batsmen to blame | accessdate = 2006-04-10 }}</ref>He is also known as the bowler who broke the 100 mph barrier in cricket bowling history.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW_Bhhh11DI 100.2 mph]

==Controversies and Injuries==
Akhtar's career has been plagued with injuries, controversies, and accusations of bad attitude. After shooting to stardom at a young age due to his devastating pace, he became more interested in speed and glamor rather than cementing his career. Although he eventually crossed the 100mph barrier, his attitude took its toll on his reputation as well as his fitness. After a poor showing in the 2003 World Cup, he got involved in a verbal spat with then captain [[Waqar Younis]]. Later he was axed along with other players, including Younis. In a triangular series in 2003 in Sri Lanka, he was caught tampering with the ball, making him the second player ever to be banned on ball tampering charges. The same year he was banned for one Test and two ODIs for abusing [[Paul Adams (cricketer)|Paul Adams]] in a match against South Africa. In the 2004 home series with India, he struggled with wrist and back injuries, which raised questions about their authenticity. During the final Test he cited injury and chose not to bowl halfway through but was met with raised eyebrows when he later turned up to bat, apparently enjoying himself. Although his injuries were not proved to be fake, his reputation suffered, especially after Haq's outburst in a post match press conference. His relationship with the captain and the coach deteriorated further partially due to his manipulative nature and partially due to politics.

He was sent back from the 2005 Australia tour with a hamstring injury amid rumors of indiscipline, lack of commitment, and attitudinal complaints. He was subsequently fined by the PCB for avoiding a late night curfew.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200502/s1305514.htm</ref> At this point, once loved Akhtar was reviled alike by teammates, opponents and cricket fans. The rest of his career was riddled with ankle and knee injuries which forced him to undergo a surgery in February 2006, until finally he was banned for two years for using performance enhancing drugs.

In November 2006, the liaison officer assigned to the Pakistani team in India, Anil Kaul, alleged that Akhtar had slapped coach Bob Woolmer following a fight over the music to be played in the team bus on the eve of ICC Champions Trophy. Both Akhtar and Woolmer have, however, strongly denied the allegations.<ref>http://cricket.indiatimes.com/articleshow/374409.cms</ref>
 
====Drug Scandal==== 
On [[October 16]], [[2006]], Akhtar was suspended by the [[Pakistan Cricket Board|PCB]], along with [[Mohammad Asif (Pakistani cricketer)|Mohammed Asif]] after the pair were tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance [[nandrolone]].<ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/iccct2006/content/current/story/263238.html</ref> They were consequently pulled from the [[ICC Champions Trophy 2006]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20589658-23212,00.html |title=Shoaib returns positive test |date=[[2006-10-16]] |author=Staff writers and wires |work=[[Fox Sports (Australia)|FOX SPORTS Australia]]}}</ref> Former PCB chairman later stated that he had always suspected Akhtar of substance abuse due to his consistent "reservations" to drug tests.<ref>http://cricket.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2191504.cms</ref> Pakistan captain [[Inzamam ul Haq]] had also previously complained about Shoaib's drug abuse but was not acted upon by the PCB.<ref>http://paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?158859</ref> Pakistan news reports state that federal capital police had arrested Shoaib Akhtar along with drugs some three years ago.<ref>http://paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?158859</ref>

Akhtar immediately declared his innocence and he declined knowingly taking any performance enhancing drugs. In a statement issued to the press, he claimed that he could never cheat team-mates or opponents.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/6054724.stm</ref> During a hearing with the PCB Anti-Doping Committee (ADC), he along with Asif maintained taking non-steroidal dietary supplements.<ref>http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/current/story/266665.html</ref> He, however, failed to convince the committee of his innocence. In its report submitted to PCB, ADC recommended a two year ban.<ref>http://www.pcboard.com.pk/Pakistan/Articles/5/5298.html</ref> 

On [[November 1]], [[2006]], PCB handed down a two-year suspension to Akhtar and a one-year suspension to Mohammad Asif, banning them from professional cricket during the period.<ref>http://uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/current/story/266573.html</ref> Akhtar had subsequently been added to Pakistan Olympic Association list of doping offenders.<ref>http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3847919a10133,00.html</ref>  However, on [[December 5]], [[2006]], he was cleared on appeal.<ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/content/current/story/271241.html</ref>

====Acquittal====

On [[December 5]] [[2006]] Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were acquitted by the tribunal appointed to review their appeals against the drugs ban imposed on them by an earlier committee. The three-man committee, headed by Justice Fakhruddin Ebrahim, voted two to one in favour of the acquittal. Haseeb Ahsan, former Test cricketer, and Ebrahim were in favour of the acquittal while the third member, Danish Zaheer, dissented. <U+201C>Exceptional circumstances<U+201D> were cited including discrepancies between the instantaneous offence charges of doping that were laid and the quick delivery of a very harsh verdict. The complete drug testing procedure was concluded to have been technically flawed as it did not follow standard procedures. Other established facts by the committee included that the duo were not aware of the banned drug to be present in their supplements because PCB itself had not informed them of the dangers of contaminated supplements.<ref>http://content-pak.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/current/story/271241.html</ref><ref>http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/271347.html</ref>

Both Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif where thankful to the PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf for giving them a fair trial and their team mates, captain, and coach for the moral support. They will not however be playing the 2006 Nov-Dec West Indies vs. Pakistan series held in Pakistan because the PCB has recommended that they play domestic games first to recover form and fitness.[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/271347.html]

However, the WADA, World Anti-Doping Agency is set to challenge Pakistan's decision to lift bans on fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif and that it would take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]].[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/other_international/pakistan/6183997.stm] The ICC, cricket's world governing body, has supported the WADA appeal adding that it was committed to a dope free game.[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/18/sports/AS_SPT_CRK_Pakistan_Doping.php]

On [[March 1]] [[2007]], Akhtar and Asif were ruled out of the Pakistani squad for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] by team officials, minutes before the squad was to depart for the [[West Indies]]. The team management along with the PCB said their injuries were too severe to risk taking them to the Carribean. Since neither of the two had been declared fit they had not undergone official doping tests. However, Pakistani officials told cricket sources off the record that the team management had feared that they would fail the doping tests as it was likely traces of [[Nandrolone]] were still present in their system.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wc2007/content/current/story/281976.html Shoaib and Asif out of the World Cup]:</ref>
