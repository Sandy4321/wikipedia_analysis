</ref> and village in on the [[Kuskokwim River]] in [[Alaska]], United States. The population was 401 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]{{GR|2|dateform=mdy}} and 346 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name="2010 Census"/> Despite its small population, the village is an important transportation and economic hub for the area.

== History ==
The Old Town McGrath site, across the river from present-day McGrath, was a meeting and trading place for [[Big River, Alaska|Big River]], [[Nikolai, Alaska|Nikolai]], [[Telida, Alaska|Telida]], and [[Lake Minchumina, Alaska|Lake Minchumina]] villagers.

In 1904, Abraham Appel established a trading post in Old Town. In 1906, gold was discovered in the Innoko District, and in 1907, and at {{not a typo|Ganes Creek}}. Since McGrath was the northernmost point on the Kuskokwim River accessible by large riverboats, it became a regional supply center. A town was established at the site of Old McGrath in 1907, and was named for Peter McGrath, a local United States Marshal. The [[Iditarod Trail]] also contributed to McGrath's role as a supply center. From 1911 to 1920, hundreds of people walked and mushed over the trail on their way to the Ophir gold districts. Mining sharply declined after 1925.

After a major flood in 1933, some residents moved across the river. Changes in the course of the river eventually left the old site on a slough, making it useless as a river stop. In 1940, an airstrip was cleared, the United States Federal Aviation Administration built a communications complex, and a school was opened. McGrath became an important refueling stop for [[Lend-Lease]] equipment during World War II.
