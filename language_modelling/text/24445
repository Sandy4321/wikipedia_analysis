'''''Hylarana megalonesa''''' is a [[species]] of [[true frog]] in the genus ''[[Hylarana]]''. It is [[endemic]] to western and northern [[Borneo]] ([[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]), but its range likely extends into adjacent [[Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. It was split off from ''[[Hylarana chalconota]]'' in 2009 by [[Robert F. Inger|Robert Inger]] and colleagues,<ref name=frost>{{cite web |url=http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/Amphibia/Anura/Ranidae/Hylarana/Hylarana-megalonesa |title=''Hylarana megalonesa'' (Inger, Stuart, and Iskandar, 2009) |author=Frost, Darrel R. |year=2014 |work=Amphibian Species of the World: an Online Reference.

==Description==
''Hylarana megalonesa'' are moderately large-sized frogs: adult males measure {{convert|33|-|48|mm|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|45|-|66|mm|abbr=on}} in snout<U+2013>vent length. Body is moderately slender and legs are long. [[Dorsum (anatomy)|Dorsum]] is weakly granular.<ref name=IngerEtAl/> Colouration is mostly green. The snout is long and pointed. Finger and toe tips have adhesive disks. It is very similar to ''[[Hylarana raniceps]]'' in colouration and general body shape but is clearly bigger in size.<ref name=Borneo/>

==Habitat==
''Hylarana megalonesa'' breeds in ponds, intermittent streams, and quiet side pools of streams. Because of its relatively recent recognition as a separate species, relatively little is known about it.<ref name=Borneo>{{cite web |url=http://frogsofborneo.org/ |title=''Hylarana megalonesa'' Large White-Lipped Frog |author=Haas, A., Hertwig, S.T., Das, I. |year=2014 |work=Frogs of Borneo |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>
