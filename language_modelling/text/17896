'''Veracruz''', officially known as '''Heroica Veracruz''', is a major port city and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Veracruz]].

When [[Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s]] arrived in Mexico in 1519, he founded a city here, which he named Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, referring to the area<U+2019>s gold and dedicated to the "True Cross", because he landed on the Christian holy day of [[Good Friday]], the day of the [[Crucifixion]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Veracruz'' (originally ''Vera Cruz''), derives from the [[Latin]] ''Vera Crux'' ([[True Cross]]). Having established the settlement of ''Villa Rica'' (Rich Village) on Good Friday 1519, Cort<U+00E9>s [[dedicate]]d the place to the True Cross as an [[Sacrifice|offering]].

The Spanish captain [[Juan de Grijalva]], along with [[Bernal D<U+00ED>az del Castillo]], first arrived in 1518 at the island later known as [[San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a]]<ref name="histchan"/>  The Spanish gave it that name because they landed on the Christian feast of [[John the Baptist]], and in honor of the captain.<ref name="sinopsis">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilo.int/public/spanish/dialogue/sector/papers/port-vc/mex2.htm |title= Estudio sobre reestructuraci<U+00F3>n portuaria - Impacto Social Sinopsis Histurica del Puerto de Veracruz |first=Jaime R |last=Sanchez Diez |publisher= Puerto de Veracruz Organizaci<U+00F3>n Internacional |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Study about the port<U+2019>s restructuring- Social Impact Historic Sinopsis of the Port of Veracruz |date=18 October 2000 |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref> ''de Ul<U+00FA>a'' is derived from the local name for the Aztecs, ''coluha'' or ''acolhua.''

Because the first expedition detected the presence of gold in the region, a second expedition under the command of Hern<U+00E1>n Cort<U+00E9>s arrived in 1519.<ref name="histchan">{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/states.do?action=detail&state=Veracruz&contentType=State_Generic&contentId=56434&parentId=MEXICO |title= The History of Veracruz |publisher= The History Channel |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref> Cort<U+00E9>s and his men landed at the shore opposite the island where Grijalva had moored, which has the pre-Hispanic name of Chalchihuecan.<ref name="encmuc"/> Cort<U+00E9>s, [[Francisco de Montejo]] and [[Alonso Hern<U+00E1>ndez Portocarrero]] founded the settlement, naming it Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. The name ''Villa Rica'' (rich village) referred to the gold that was found here and ''Vera cruz'' (True Cross) was added because the Cort<U+00E9>s expedition landed on [[Good Friday]], a Christian holy day.<ref name="encmuc"/> When Cort<U+00E9>s and his soldiers elected a <U+201C>Justicia Mayor<U+201D> and a <U+201C>Capit<U+00E1>n General,<U+201D> they created the first city council on the American continent.<ref name="sinopsis"/> The city was the first on mainland America to receive a European coat of arms, which was authorized by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Carlos V]] in [[Valladolid]], Spain on 4 July 1523.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The original settlement was moved to what is now known as Antigua, at the mouth of the Huitzilpan or Antigua River shortly thereafter.<ref name="encmuc"/> This separated the city from the port, as ships could not enter the shallow river. Ships continued to dock at San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a, with small boats being used to ferry goods on and off the ships. When large-scale smuggling of goods took place to avoid customs officials,<ref name="sinopsis"/> the Spanish Crown ordered the settlement returned to its original site to cut down on that traffic.<ref name="encmuc"/> Docks and an observation tower were constructed on the island to ensure that goods went through customs officials.<ref name="sinopsis"/>

As in other parts of Mexico, the [[indigenous peoples]] suffered from epidemics of European infectious diseases and maltreatment, which decimated the population after contact. The Spanish began to import African slaves via the port of Veracruz to work on [[sugarcane]] plantations. In the 16th century, this state had more slaves than any other in Mexico.<ref name="histchan"/>

By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish had constructed roads to link Veracruz with other cities such as [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Veracruz|C<U+00F3>rdoba]], [[Orizaba, Veracruz|Orizaba]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Xalapa]] and [[Perote, Veracruz|Perote]]. Their gold and silver were the principal exports.<ref name="histchan"/><ref name="sinopsis"/> This caused the city problems with pirates, prompting the construction of Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a on the island where Grijalva landed in the mid 16th century.<ref name="encmuc"/> Major public buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 17th century: the municipal palace, the monastery of Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de la Merced, and the Hospital de Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Loreto. In 1618, a fire nearly reduced much of the city to ashes. In 1640, the Barlovento Armada was stationed here for further protection against pirates.<ref name="encmuc"/> Through the rest of the colonial period, this was the most important port in [[New Spain]], with a large wealthy merchant class that was more prosperous than that of Mexico City.<ref name="ayuntamiento"/> The pirates Van Hoorn, [[Laurens de Graaf]] and [[Michel de Grammont]] attacked Vera Cruz in 1683.

The 19th century was marked by armed conflicts. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Spain placed troops here to maintain Mexico City<U+2019>s sea link with Spain. In 1816, [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] commanded royalist troops countering the insurgency. In 1820, insurgents took the city, despite Santa Anna<U+2019>s attempts to stop them. The last viceroy of New Spain, [[Juan O'Donoj<U+00FA>]], arrived here in 1821, where he signed the [[Treaty of C<U+00F3>rdoba]] with [[Agust<U+00ED>n de Iturbide]] at Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a. In 1823, Spanish troops remaining at Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a fired on the newly independent Mexican city of Veracruz. The city<U+2019>s defense against the attack earned it its first title of <U+201C>Heroic City.<U+201D> During the [[Pastry War]] in 1837, the city mounted a defense against a French attack, and earned its second title of "Heroic City."<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1847, during the [[Mexican<U+2013>American War]], United States forces invaded the city. It was defended by generals Juan Morales and Jos<U+00E9> Juan de Landero, but they were forced to surrender a few days later. The government of Mexico recognized Veracruz with a third title of <U+201C>Heroic City.<U+201D><ref name="encmuc"/>

Ten years later, civil war between liberals and conservatives forced [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez]]<U+2019>s government to flee the capital of Mexico City. Ju<U+00E1>rez went to Veracruz and governed from there in 1857.<ref name="histchan"/>  In the 1861 Spain sent its troops to occupy the port in an effort to secure payment of debts, which Ju<U+00E1>rez had suspended. French military forces accompanied them [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximiliano I]] and occupied the city when the emperor and his wife [[Carlota of Belgium]] arrived in 1864.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The conflicts and damaged trade relations with Europe took its toll on the port of Veracruz. By 1902, the port facilities had deteriorated and it was considered one of the most dangerous on the American coast. President [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]] contracted with foreign enterprises to modernize the port<U+2019>s infrastructure.<ref name="sinopsis"/>

In 1914, during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910-1920), the US [[United States occupation of Veracruz|attacked and occupied]] the port in an effort to try to preserve trade. The city gained its fourth title of "Heroic City".<ref name="encmuc"/>

After the Revolution, most port workers became unionized. Through most of the 20th century, federal and state legal and political initiatives intended to better workers<U+2019> lives had effects on the operations of the port. Eventually, unions came to have great power over the operations and tariffs charged. By the latter part of the 20th century, competing unions made the operations of the port difficult. Some blocked access to the port from federal roads and financial corruption was a problem.

In the 1970s, a federal commission was established to design a new administrative system for the ports of Mexico. The legislature passed laws authorizing the federal government to take control over important ports such as Veracruz. The federal government modernized the port, adopting automation of loading and unloading. This resulted in a reduction of 80% of the port's jobs and labor resistance through strikes. The dockworkers' unions unified, negotiating for members to have a stake in a new company to manage the port's functions, named the Empresa de Servicios Portuarios de Veracruz, S.A. de C.V. The old Compa<U+00F1>ia Terminal de Veracruz was dissolved in 1988 and the new organization was fully in place by 1991.<ref name="sinopsis"/>

In September 2010, [[Hurricane Karl (2010)|Hurricane Karl]], a small, strong Category 3 hurricane, caused widespread flooding and damage affecting approximately half a million people. Sixteen were confirmed dead with another eleven missing. Sixty-five municipalities in the state were declared disaster areas. Preliminary damage estimates total up to $3.9 billion USD and $50 billion MXN.<ref name="karl1">{{cite news |title=Sigue la devastaci<U+00F3>n por el hurac<U+00E1>n Karl |author=Alberto N<U+00E1>jar |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/america_latina/2010/09/100920_mexico_devastacion_karl_veracruz_fp.shtml |newspaper=BBC Mundo |date=20 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Devastation from Hurricane Karl continues }}</ref>

Much of the most recent commercial development has been in newer areas in the south of the city and in the neighboring municipality of Boca del R<U+00ED>o, linked by a ten-kilometer road along the shore that caters to tourists and business travelers. The hotels in Veracruz are more rustic and traditional; the modern ones are in Boca del R<U+00ED>o, especially near Playa Mocambo.<ref name="vcity">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/veracruz/veracruz-city/ |title= Veracruz City |publisher=Fodor<U+2019>s |accessdate=30 October 2009 }}</ref>

==Notable sites==
[[File:Veracruz, Veracruz - Summer 2009.jpg|upright|thumb|The plaza in the center of the city of Veracruz]]
Veracruz is not as popular a tourist destination as many other resort areas.<ref name="alisau"/> However the city has been promoting itself as a tourist location with new attractions such as the Veracruz Aquarium and the City Museum and the renovation of old ones such as Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a and the Naval Academy.<ref name="bestday"/>

The cultural center of the city is its main plaza, officially named Plaza de las Armas but commonly called the Zocalo. In this tree-filled square, in which have camped a number of foreign invading armies, is occupied from morning to night with people playing dominos, selling food, cigars, etc. playing music, dancing and other activities. It is more crowded in the evening where just about every night the [[danz<U+00F3>n]] is danced. This dance was brought over to Mexico from Cuba by refugees in the 1870s. It was originally restricted to the lower classes but eventually gained accepted by all levels of society. This is sponsored by several dance schools dedicated to keeping the tradition alive. Around the plaza there are numerous shops and restaurants as well as the municipal palace and the cathedral.<ref name="alisau"/><ref name="portalCH">{{Cite web |url= http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153,4202334&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title= Centro Hist<U+00F3>rico de la Ciudad y Puerto de Veracruz  |language=Spanish |trans_title=Historic Center of the City and the Port of Veracruz|accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>
[[File:Ver-Pal Mpal.jpg|thumb|left|Municipal Palace of Veracruz]]

The Municipal Palace was built for the city council in 1608, though the building was extensively remodeled in the 18th century. Its architectural style is a sober [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] with a tower at one of the corners. It is said that this tower was used to keep watch on the ships entering and leaving the port. It has a large courtyards surrounded by wide arches and is the oldest city government building in Mexico.<ref name="portalCH"/>

The city's [[Cathedral of Veracruz|cathedral]], named Virgen de la Asunci<U+00F3>n, is also located on the Zocalo. This cathedral was begun in the 17th century and finished in 1731. It was modified in the 19th century but did not become a cathedral until 1963. The building has five [[nave]]s, with an octagonal [[cupola]] covered in [[Talavera (pottery)|Puebla tiles]]. The tower was begun in the early 20th century and has its own small cupola. The main fa<U+00E7>ade is [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]] with two levels and a crest. The lower level contains an arched entrance flanked by two [[Doric order|Doric columns]] and the upper level contains the choral window, above which is a medallion.

The ''malec<U+00F3>n'' (boardwalk) stretches for kilometers along the Gulf of Mexico leading away from the city center into the suburbs.

[[File:San Juan de Ulua-Puerto de Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|Fort [[San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a]]]]
Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a is located on an island, now connected to land, of the same name. The island is part of the La Gallega coral reef and has about 2,500 meters of beach. The full reef covers about 100 hectares and varies in depth between sixty and ninety centimeters, forming a natural break.<ref name="sinopsis"/> In the pre-Hispanic era, this island was a sanctuary dedicated to the god Tezcatlipoca.<ref name="portalCH"/> The site where the Spanish first landed is now the container ship terminal of the port.<ref name="sinopsis"/> However, most of the island is occupied by the fort. This fort was where the Spanish first landed to conquer Mexico and was also their last stand during and just after the Mexican War of Independence.<ref name="portalCH"/>  For the time in-between, the location also serves as a reminder of the days of piracy and the [[Mexican Inquisition|Inquisition]].<ref name="alisau"/> The fort was begun here in 1582 to protect the city from pirates.<ref name="portalCH"/> The danger of attack by foreign powers prompted the Spanish to enlarge the fort in 1635. It was finished in 1707.<ref name="alisau"/>

After the War of Independence ended in 1821, the Spanish kept control of the island and fort, and occasionally would bombard Mexican forces on land. This area was finally handed over to Mexico in 1825. The fort next saw action in 1838 during the Pastry War with the French. In 1847, it would witness the invasion of U.S. forces during the Mexican<U+2013>American War.<ref name="portalCH"/>

[[File:Baluarte Santiago2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Baluarte de Santiago]] (Santiago bastion)]]
In the 19th century, the fort was converted into a military prison.<ref name="portalCH"/> The fort<U+2019>s narrow stone passageways lead to a series of dungeons with walls 24-feet thick in some places. Those cells which were darker and hotter were reserved for those charged with more serious crimes. A few of the most dreaded dungeons were nicknamed "Heaven", "Purgatory" and "Hell". Some of prison<U+2019>s more famous prisoners include Fray [[Servando Teresa de Mier]] and Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez, both political prisoners. But the most famous is Jes<U+00FA>s Arriaga, better known as "[[Chucho el Roto]]".<ref name="alisau"/> Most people visit San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a due to the legend of this bandit.<ref name="todd">{{Cite web |url= http://www.johntoddjr.com/122%20Chucho/chucho01.htm |title= Chucho el Roto: The Legend of a Mexican Bandit The Folk Hero of San Juan de Ulua |first=John |last=Todd Jr. |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

Jes<U+00FA>s Arriaga, better known as "Chucho el Roto", was held at Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a where he died. It is not known whether he died of natural causes, as a result of a fight with other prisoners or by other means. Chucho was a [[Robin Hood]] figure who lived during the 19th century.<ref name="uvmx"/> He stole from the rich and gave to the poor, inspiring songs and poetry such as the verses penned by Rafeal de Zayas Enriquez. Chucho was arrested in [[Quer<U+00E9>taro, Quer<U+00E9>taro|Quer<U+00E9>taro]] after a jewelry store heist. He was sent to the Belen Prison in Mexico City, then to Veracruz. He was also renowned as a seducer of women, especially those who were rich and lonely.

Along with Fort San Juan de Ul<U+00FA>a, the city used to be walled in for protection against pirates and invasions. All that is left of these walls is the "Baluarte", a small fortress. The 1635 structure has thick, sturdy walls with cannons outwards to the sea.

The City Museum (Museo de la Ciudad) is located at the intersections of Zaragoza and Esteban Morales streets in the historic center. It is housed in a two-story building which is of [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassic]] design built between the mid and latter 19th century. The main fa<U+00E7>ade on Zaragoza Street has an enormous main door with posts, framed by [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[pilaster]]s, which reach to the upper floor, and toped by a [[pediment]] and a [[cornice]]. The building was originally constructed to be an asylum, but in 1861, the [[French Intervention in Mexico|French invaded Veracruz]] and the building was commandeered for other purposes until 1870. The asylum then operated here for almost 100 years, until the construction of new facilities in the south of the city, and work was undertaken to restore and modify the building for a museum. The City Museum was inaugurated in 1970 and contains exhibits relating to the history of the city of Veracruz.<ref name="museociudad">{{Cite web |url= http://www.amiweb.com.mx/mc/ |title=Descripci<U+00F3>n e Historia del Edificio del Museo de la Ciudad "Coronel Manuel Gutierrez Zamora |language=Spanish |trans_title=Description and History of the building of the City Museum "Coronel Manuel Gutierrez Zamora" |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:Isla de Sacrificios-Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|Isla de Sacrificios]]
Veracruz is primarily a commercial port, but there are some beaches and other sea attractions. The most contentious attraction is the island called [[Isla de Sacrificios]], which lies just off the coast of the city and measures 450 meters long and 198 meters wide. The island is part of a system of twenty three coral reefs called the Veracruz Reef System which is a national park.<ref name="jornada">{{Cite news |title= La isla in disputa |first=Gabriela |last=Cortanos Delgado |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/10/31/eco-d.html |newspaper= La Jornada Ecol<U+00F3>gica |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |date=31 October 2005 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |language=Spanish |trans_title= The island in dispute }}</ref>  It is possible to kayak to the Isla de Sacrificios to observe seagulls, pelicans and the fish that inhabit the coral reef.<ref name="portal">{{Cite web |url= http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=153,4198113&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title= Portal de Ciudadano Veracruz |language=Spanish |trans_title=Veracruz Citizen Portal|accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref> In 1983, a study and initial cleanup project was undertaken at the island, which collected fifty tons of trash. Shortly thereafter, the island was closed to the public and since then, there has been a struggle between authorities, tour operators and fisherman as to the fate of the island. There are those who would like to build hotels, restaurants and other facilities for ecotourism. However, access to the island has been restricted to research, teaching and the occasional sporting event.<ref name="jornada"/>

Other small islands and shoals off the coast include: [[Isla de Enmedio]], [[Isla Verde, Mexico|Isla Verde]], [[Anegada de Adentro]], [[Santiaguillo]] and [[Anegada de Afuera]], the last two next to Anton Lizardo beach. All of them are enclosed into the Sistema Arrecifal Veracruzano national park and make fine sites for SCUBA diving. There are several operators offering scuba equipment and tours both in Veracruz and in Boca del Rio as well. The best season for scuba diving is May to August.

[[File:Catedral de Veracruz.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Veracruz]]]]
For 400 years, the island has suffered ecologically from the pillaging of its coral reefs and archeological pieces and pollution.{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} Current pollution problems are mostly due to untreated wastewater that flows into the ocean from the city and from the polluted Jamapa River. Its coastline has been modified and more than 200 hectares of reefs in its littoral zone have been pillaged. Coral and other marine species have been taken for commercial and craft purposes, as well as by fishermen. Some of these reefs are already dead due to pollution. Since the island was closed, there has been some recuperation of marine life here.<ref name="jornada"/>

Ruins here have not been extensively studied but cover more than 700 years of history. In the pre-Hispanic era, the island was considered sacred and sanctuary on which to perform religious rites. [[Human sacrifice]] was frequently performed and the remains buried here. There was a small altar here but it has not been found. The Spanish built a hospital here, but all that is left of this is part of one wall. Later, a storage faculty to store gunpowder was built, as well as an obelisk during the French Intervention, but these have crumbled as well. Only a small lighthouse currently exists. About 800 archeological pieces have been partially excavated on the island but cannot be exhibited because the humidity and weather would damage them.<ref name="jornada"/>

[[File:Playa Villa del Mar-Puerto de Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|Villa del Mar]]
Reopening the island is difficult because the ecosystem here is delicate, and any construction could damage archeological sites and valuable pieces. Any plans to reopen the island to visitors will require the participation of the Veracruz Reef System Park, to which it belongs, as well as Secretariat of the Navy, [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog<U+00ED>a e Historia|INAH]], the Veracruz Aquarium and other government agencies negotiating with the local associations of hotels, tour operators and fishermen. So far, government agencies have blocked efforts to develop anything on the island. An ecotourism project consisting of guided tours is considered the most viable, such as that proposed by the [[Universidad Veracruzana|Veracruzana University]] and the Aquarium, but there is concern on the part of INAH and the Secretariat of the Navy.<ref name="jornada"/>

On the mainland, there are a number of beaches. Playa Mart<U+00ED> is located between the city of Veracruz and Boca del R<U+00ED>o, five km from the historic center. This beach is equipped with goals and nets for soccer and volleyball. The Playa de Hornos is located next to the Veracruz Aquarium. It is safe to swim here and there are tables, chairs and umbrellas to rent, as well as food stands. During the high seasons there are lifeguards and banana boats to rent. There are also boats that take tourist to the Isla de Sacrificio and Canuncito. Villa del Mar is just south of Playa de Hornos and is more popular.<ref name="portal"/>

==Culture==
[[File:Typische Stra<U+00DF>enszene in Veracruz Mexiko fcm.JPG|thumb|left|Street scene from the Zocalo]]
Because of its importance as Mexico's principal Caribbean and Atlantic sea port, Veracruz has always been a locus for the mixture of different cultures, particularly native Mexican, Spanish and African. During the colonial period, African slaves were brought to work in the fields and shipyards. Since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, other groups of immigrants, such as Italians and Cubans, have made their homes in the city.<ref name="alisau"/><ref name="bestday"/><ref name="Hursh"/>

Sugar and rum production which in colonial times demanded slave labor and an immigrant workforce after independence has brought forth this mixture of cultures.<ref name="snapper"/><ref name="Hughson">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1320-veracruz-for-gringos |title= Veracruz For Gringos  |first=Dean and Yoly |last=Hughson Graber |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref> Moreover, as the home of the Naval Academy of Mexico, one can see not only Mexican sailors but also foreign travelers wandering the town.<ref name="Hughson"/> The city has a reputation for being boisterous, with people in the squares listening to music late into the night - only then to wake up early the next morning to drink coffee at sidewalk cafes.<ref name="vcity"/>

[[File:AreasVerdesDelRegistroCivil VeraruzVeracruzMexico.jpeg|thumb|A small plaza outside the civil registry]]
Veracruz recipes use corn, beans and squash, much like the rest of Mexico, but Veracruzians' diets are also typically supplemented by indigenous tropical foods such as [[chili pepper]]s, tomatoes, [[avocado]]s, [[pineapple]]s, [[papaya]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[peanut]]s and [[sapote]] fruit, all of which have been present since pre-Columbian times. The Spanish introduced herbs such as [[parsley]], [[thyme]], [[marjoram]], [[bay laurel]] and [[cilantro]] as well as [[saffron]], wheat, rice, almonds, olives/olive oil, garlic and [[capers]].<ref name="Hursh"/> These are far more prevalent in Veracruz cooking than in other parts of the country.<ref name="snapper"/>

A signature dish of the area ''[[Huachinango a la Veracruzana]]'' ([[red snapper (fish)|red snapper]] Veracruz-style) uses local fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, chili peppers) and Spanish ingredients (olive oil, garlic and capers). Other popular dishes include {{lang|es|''arroz a la tumbada''}}, a rice dish baked with a variety of seafood and {{lang|es|''caldo de mariscos''}}, a seafood soup reputed to cure [[hangover]]s.<ref name="Hursh"/>

[[File:GrandCafeParroquiaVeracruz.JPG|thumb|left|"El Gran Caf<U+00E9> de la Parroquia" is the most famous coffeehouse in Veracruz. Its signature drink, the "lechero", consists of espresso coffee mixed with steamed milk.]]
Coffeehouses are a center of social life in the city, and the Gran Caf<U+00E9> del Portal and the Caf<U+00E9> de la Parroquia are the two best known establishments. To request a refill, customers clink the sides of their glasses (not cups) with their spoons. This clinking can be heard from the early morning to late at night. The story behind this custom is that a trolley driver used to ring his bell when he was a block away from the Gran Caf<U+00E9> del Portal to let the waiters know he was coming. When the driver died, his casket was borne on the trolley and when it passed the establishment, the customers and waiters clinked glasses in his honor.<ref name="alisau"/>

The song "[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]" made famous by [[Ritchie Valens]] has it roots in the Veracruz [[son (music)|"son"]] style of music, which originated in southern Veracruz state, with African and Caribbean influence, and is popular throughout Mexico, Latin America and the United States. Traditional Veracruzian music is called "[[Son Jarocho]]". Although there are many types of son music found in Mexico, the Son Jarocho is typically associated with the city of Veracruz. Other types of son include "Son Comercial". This style is faster and flashier than the traditional Son Jarocho and can be heard in [[Ballet Folklorico de Mexico|Mexican folkdance exhibitions]], when Veracruz women with long white dresses and fans dance with partners also dressed in white. The Son Comercial developed in the 1940s from the Son Jarocho, and is so pervasive that today many incorrectly consider it the original. The Casa de Cultura has a workshops for traditional music and son singers can be heard just about anytime on the main plaza (Zocalo)<ref name="carraher">{{Cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1598-la-bamba-explained-or-the-music-of-veracruz  |title= La Bamba Explained - Or, The Music Of Veracruz  |first=Janice |last=Carraher |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>
[[File:Carro alegorico veracruz.JPG|thumb|Float from the Veracruz Carnaval]]

The Veracruz Carnaval has been celebrated every year since 1866, during the empire of Maximilian I. At that time, a request was made to sponsor "Festival of Masks" which would consist of dances at the principal social gathering sites of the city such as the main theater. While the events were officially held at these locations, others took advantage of the celebration on the streets, near these sites. Eventually, the event became based in the historic center of the city and focused on the Carnaval Parade of Veracruz. Today, the event begins with the "Burning of Bad Humor" and ends wIth the "Burial of Juan Carnaval".<ref name="vcarnaval">{{Cite web |url= http://www.carnavaldeveracruz.com.mx/ |title= Carnaval de Veracruz Tradici<U+00F3>n  |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref> Carnaval here is the largest in the country.<ref name="bestday"/>  Filmmaking is also done in the municipality.

==Industry==
[[Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant]] (LVNPP) in nearby Alto Lucero, Veracruz, produces about 4.5% of Mexico's electrical energy.

==Transportation==
[[General Heriberto Jara International Airport]] serves the city with daily service to Mexico City as well as international service to Houston and Dallas. The commercial passenger airlines to currently serve VER airport are [[Aeromexico]], [[Interjet]], [[United Airlines]], [[American Airlines]], [[Aeromar]] [[Vivaaerobus]] and Mayair.

Veracruz is linked to Mexico City by a four-lane toll highway which also passes through Cordoba and Puebla. Half-way between Veracruz and Cordoba it is connected to the La Tinaja-Cosoleacaque toll highway which goes as far as Villahermosa, Tabasco. There is another toll highway to the state capital [[Xalapa]].

==Education==
The [[Universidad Veracruzana]] was established in 1944. It was created by joining a number of professional and higher education establishments together. It is now the main center of higher education in the state of Veracruz, with five campuses and twenty-two satellite locations in the state. The student population is approximately 70,000, offering degrees in sixty different fields.<ref name="introducc">{{Cite web |url= http://www.uv.mx/universidad/info/introduccion.html|title= Introducci<U+00F3>n Universidad Veracruzana |language=Spanish |trans_title=Introduction Veracruzana University |accessdate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

==The port==
[[File:Torre de Pemex.jpg|thumb|Local offices of Pemex]]
Veracruz is Mexico's oldest and largest port and the port most connected with its history.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="alisau"/><ref name="Rueda"/> During the colonial period, it was the most important port in New Spain, with a large wealthy merchant class that was more prosperous than Mexico City.<ref name="ayuntamiento"/> From the port of Veracruz were exported turkeys, corn, beans, avocados, and cotton to Spain. From Spain came [[fava bean]]s, wheat, rice, cattle, pigs, fabric, wine and other goods. In the mid 16th century, so much gold and silver was found in Veracruz that it became the bulk of the exports to Spain. This attracted pirates, mostly from Britain and Holland, such as [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins]].<ref name="ayuntamiento"/> As the Spanish did initially, Veracruz was the point of invasion for other countries such as France and the United States.<ref name="encmuc"/>

[[File:Detalle del Puerto-Veracruz-Mexico.jpeg|thumb|left|View of the shipping docks]]
In the latter half of the 19th century, Veracruz's importance waned as trade to Europe diminished. The port was refurbished at the beginning of the 20th century, but petroleum production was the primary income for the state rather than the port.<ref name="sinopsis"/> This began to change in the latter half of the 20th century, and the port has surged back to the state's economic forefront,<ref name="bestday"/>

In 1991, the [[Government of Mexico|federal government]] took over the port of Veracruz to correct the handling of merchandise through here. Later that same year, the first private shipping companies began operations. In 1993, the Law of Ports was passed regularizing the operations of ports in the country. Under this law was created the Administraci<U+00F3>n Portuaria de Veracruz (Port Authority of Veracruz).<ref name="puerto">{{Cite web |url=http://www.puertodeveracruz.com.mx/portal/page?_pageid=40,1033008&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title= El Puerto Hoy |publisher= Administraci<U+00F3>n Portuaria Integral de Veracruz SA de CV  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 October 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[File:Faro Venustiano Carranza y Torre de Pemex.jpg|thumb|The port complex of Veracruz]]
In the 2000s, the port continues to handle all kinds of cargo, moving 16.1 million tons{{Verify source|date=June 2010}} of products in 2004. This figure is expected to rise once modernization efforts have finished, especially a truck bypass that leads directly from the highway to the port.<ref name="Rueda"/> Veracruz is the gateway for Mexico's automobile industry, which is concentrated in the center of the country, in the states around Mexico City. This port has several advantages. It is the first to be equipped specifically for shipping automobiles. Located on the south-central coast, Veracruz is closer to car manufacturers and has better access to both import and export markets in the U.S., Europe, Central and South America than other Mexican ports. In 2004, the port handled 70% of the automobiles exported. With traffic expected rise the port authorities unveiled a program to enlarge the port's infrastructure and expand operations by 2010.<ref name="Rueda"/>

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the city of Veracruz is the governing authority for 128 other named localities during the 2010 census, forming a municipality with a territory of {{convert|241|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="encmuc"/> The population of the municipality is 552,156 inhabitants, of whom 428,323 or approximately 77.6% live in municipality's portion of the city proper.<ref name="2010 census tables: INEGI"/> The municipality is bordered by the municipalities of [[La Antigua, Veracruz|La Antigua]], Boca del R<U+00ED>o, [[Manlio Fabio Altamirano, Veracruz|Manlio Fabio Altamirano]], Medell<U+00ED>n, and Paso de Ovejas, with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the northeast, and has an average altitude of ten meters above seal level. The area is flat with little in the way of elevations and is crossed by the Medio, Grande and Tonay<U+00E1>n Rivers. There are also beaches here such as the Sacrificios and Verde. Its climate is tropical with an average temperature of {{convert|25.3|<U+00B0>C|1}}. Vegetation is mostly of the rainforest type, with many trees losing leaves during the winter dry season. Fauna mostly consists of birds, small mammals and insects.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Much of the land in the municipality outside of the city is used for agriculture and livestock. Principal crops include corn, beans, watermelon, oranges, [[sorghum]], [[mango]], pineapple and sugar cane. Livestock raised includes cattle, pigs, sheep, fowl and horses. There is also some forestry. The municipality contains deposits of marble, lime, cement, sand and clay. In and around the city there are a number of industrial sites producing paints and solvents, food products, plastics, petrochemicals and metals.<ref name="encmuc"/>
