The Stroop effect refers to the fact that naming the color of the first group of words is easier and quicker than the second.
</div>
In [[psychology]], the '''Stroop effect''' is a demonstration of interference in the [[reaction time]] of a task. When a word such as blue, green, red, etc. is printed in a [[color]] differing from the color expressed by the word's [[semantic]] meaning (e.g. the word "red" printed in blue ink), a delay occurs in the processing of the word's color, leading to slower test reaction times and an increase in mistakes. The effect is named after [[John Ridley Stroop]] who first published the effect in English in 1935.<ref name="stroop">

The effect was first published in 1929, but only in German<ref name="Jaensch"/><ref name="pmid5328883"/><ref name="pmid2034749"/> However it is named after [[John Ridley Stroop]] who published the effect in English in 1935 in an article titled ''Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions'' which includes three different experiments.<ref name="stroop"/> 

In the experiments he administered several variations of the same test for which three different kind of stimulus were created. In the first one names of colors appeared in black ink. In the second names of colors appeared in a different ink than the color named. Finally in the third one there were squares of a given color.<ref name="stroop"/>

In the first experiment the participants had to read the written color names of the words in color and black ink. In the second experiment subjects were required to say the color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the dot squares. Additionally Stroop in the third experiment tested his participants at different stages of practice with each task, to account for the effects of association.<ref name="stroop"/>

Stroop identified a large increase on the time taken by participants to complete the color reading in the second task compared to the naming of the color of the squares in experiment 2 while this delay did not appear in the first experiment. Such interference was explained by the automation of reading, where the mind automatically determines the [[semantic]] meaning of the word, and then must override this first impression with the identification of the color of the word, a process which is not automatized.<ref name="stroop"/> 

As opposed to the  Stroop test most commonly used in psychological evaluation J.R Stroop never compared the time used for reading black words and the time needed for naming colors that conflicted with the written word.

==Research use==

If a number or letter is presented to such an individual in a color other than what they would perceive, there is a delay in determining what color the character actually is.<ref>Ramachandran, V.S. and Edward M.

==Clinical use==
Since its development, the Stroop task, a measure of the effect of interference on performance of a color identification task, has utilized the Stroop effect to investigate aspects of such varied psychological disorders as [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]], [[Schizophrenia]], and [[anorexia nervosa|Anorexia]].  [[EEG]] and [[fMRI]] studies of the Stroop effect have revealed selective activation of the anterior [[cingulate cortex]] during a stroop task, a prefrontal structure (see [[frontal lobe]]) in the brain which is hypothesized to be responsible for conflict monitoring.  

[[Edith Kaplan]]'s group (developer of the Delis-Kaplan [[neuropsychological test]] battery) developed the task further by separating the task into four different stages: naming color fields, congruent color words, incongruent color words, and combined.  The additional strain on the [[executive function]] of the [[brain]] allows for a more precise diagnosis.{{Fact|date=October 2008}}

==In popular culture==
The ''[[Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!]]'' software program, produced by [[Ry<U+016B>ta Kawashima]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] portable [[video game]] system, contains an automated Stroop Test administrator module, translated into game form.

A ''[[NOVA (TV series)|Nova]]'' episode used the Stroop Effect to illustrate the subtle changes of the mental flexibility of Mt. Everest climbers in relation to altitude.<ref>{{cite web
