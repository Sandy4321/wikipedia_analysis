==Personal life==

Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on February 11, 1873, Krieger received his early education from the [[Lutheran]] schools in that city. He showed artistic talents at an early age, and at 13 enrolled in the [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute School of Art and Design]]. Krieger continued his studies at the Charcoal Club School of Fine Arts. He married Agnes Checkley Keighler in 1904; she died in 1939. They had one daughter.<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/>

==Career==
[[File:Russula virescens illustration 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Krieger's illustration of ''[[Russula virescens]]'', from [[Thomas Taylor (botanist)|Thomas Taylor's]] 1898 work ''Student's Hand-book of Mushrooms of America Edible and Poisonous'']]
At the age of 18, Krieger started employment as an artist assistant in the Division of Microscopy at the Department of Agriculture, and spent time painting mushrooms found around the [[District of Columbia]] area. When the [[Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Julius Sterling Morton]], closed the department in 1895, Krieger spent a year in [[Munich]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts]]. After returning to America in 1896, he became an instructor of drawing and painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art and Design. Although he developed a reputation as a portrait painter, Krieger did not particularly enjoy this employment, finding it dull.<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/> In 1902, he started working as a [[Technical Illustration|scientific illustrator]] for mycologist [[William Gibson Farlow]] at [[Harvard University]], a position that lasted for the next decade. During this time, earnestly immersed himself in his work, painting several hundreds of images of mushrooms. He also started indexing the world's mycological literature, a project that continued for the next 30 years.<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/>

In 1912, Krieger accepted a position at the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], at the Plant Introduction Garden in [[Chico, California]]. Here, under the supervision of [[David Griffiths (botanist)|David Griffiths]], he produced a series of images on species of the [[cactus]] family. He returned to illustrating mushrooms in 1918 when he returned to Baltimore to work for the noted gynecologist [[Howard A. Kelly]]. Over the following 10 years he published several scientific articles that appeared in ''[[Mycologia]]'' and other journals, including the May 1920 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'', which featured 16 of his colored plates.<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/> He also assisted Kelly in indexing his mycological library, which, with about 12,000 items and valued at $100,000, was considered one of the most extensive privately owned mycological libraries in the country.<ref name="Kanouse 1943"/> Kelly donated his library and fungus collections to the [[University of Michigan]], where, according to Kelly's wishes, it was named the "L.C.C. Krieger Mycological Library".<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/>

Krieger was an artists with the Tropical Plant Research Foundation in Cuba from 1928<U+2013>29, where he illustrated [[sugarcane]] diseases. He was then a mycologist with the [[New York State Museum]], during which time he prepared the book ''A Popular Guide to the Higher Fungi (Mushrooms) of New York State'', which was eventually published in 1935.<ref name="Stevenson 1941"/>
