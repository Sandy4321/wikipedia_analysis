{{JohnMcCainSegments|right}}'''John Sidney McCain III ''' (born [[August 29]] [[1936]]) is a [[United States Senator]] from [[Arizona]], and a candidate in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].  He served in the U.S. military from 1954 until 1981.

Both [[John S. McCain, Jr.|McCain's father]] and [[John S. McCain, Sr.|grandfather]] were [[Admiral (United States)|admirals]] in the [[United States Navy]]. McCain attended the [[United States Naval Academy]], graduating in 1958. He then flew [[attack aircraft]] from [[aircraft carrier|carriers]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] in 1967, he narrowly escaped death in the [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|''Forrestal'' fire]]. On his twenty-third bombing mission over [[North Vietnam]] later in 1967, he was shot down and badly injured. He subsequently endured five and a half years as a  [[prisoner of war]], including periods of [[torture]], before being released in 1973 as the war ended.<BR>

===Early life===
For the first ten years of his life, "Johnny" McCain (as he was often known)<ref name="timberg-bio-ch1"/> was frequently uprooted as his family (including older sister Sandy and younger brother Joe)<ref name="timberg-bio-ch1"/> followed his father to [[New London, Connecticut]], [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] and various other stations in the [[Pacific Ocean]]; McCain attended whatever naval base school was available, often to the detriment of his education<ref name="alexander-19">{{cite book |title = Man of the People: The Life of John McCain |first = Paul |last = Alexander |authorlink=Paul Alexander |id = ISBN 0-471-22829-X |year = 2002 |publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]]|pages=p. 19}}</ref> as schools were sometimes substandard and curriculum material from one to another either repeated or skipped.<ref name="ff-100">''Faith of My Fathers'', p. 100.</ref>  After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, his father was absent for long stretches.<ref name="timberg-bio-ch1"/>  As a child, John was known for a quick temper and an aggressive drive to compete and prevail.<ref name="alexander-19"/>  He would later write that during his brief stays in these schools, "When I was disciplined by my teachers, which happened regularly, it was often for fighting."<ref name="ff-100"/>  His formal education was supplemented by the efforts of his mother, who took advantage of the family's many long-distance travels to expose him to as many historical and cultural sites as possible;<ref name="ff-103">''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 101<U+2013>103.</ref> he would later write, "She taught me to find so much pleasure in life that misfortune could not rob me of the joy of living."<ref name="ff-103"/>

After [[World War II]] was over, his father stayed in the Navy, sometimes working political liaison posts;<ref name="timberg-bio-ch1"/> the family settled in [[Northern Virginia]], and McCain attended the educationally stronger [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School|St. Stephen's School]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] from 1946 to 1949,<ref>Alexander (2002), p. 20.</ref> where he began to develop an unruly, defiant streak.<ref name="alextimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.alextimes.com/article.asp?article=7851&paper=1&cat=141 | title=Episcopal fetes a favorite son | author= Arundel, John | work=[[Alexandria Times]] | date=2007-12-06 | accessdate=2007-12-07}}</ref> Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations;<ref>Alexander (2002), p. 21.</ref> altogether he attended about twenty different schools during his youth.<ref name="ap-wmd"/>  He would later write, "The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career. ...

McCain graduated from the Naval Academy in 1958; he was fifth from the bottom in [[class rank]],<ref name="dmr-mccain"/> 894th out of 899.<ref name="timberg-ns-ch1"/>  Despite his difficulties, McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy <U+2014> those involving courage, resilience, honor, and sacrifice for one's country<ref name="ff-151">''Faith of My Fathers'', pp. 151<U+2013>152.</ref> <U+2014> and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears.<ref name="ff-151"/>  Indeed, his grandfather and father had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively.<ref>Timberg, ''An American Odyssey'', pp. 18, 28.</ref>  More importantly, McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that in order "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime it would be necessary for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest,"<ref name="ff-151"/> a lesson that he would need to carry him through a desperate and uncertain time a decade later.<ref name="ff-151"/>
