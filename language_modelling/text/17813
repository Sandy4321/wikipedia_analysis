'''Rachel Louise Carson''' (May 27, 1907 <U+2013> April 14, 1964) was an American [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and [[nature writer]] whose writings are credited with advancing the global [[environmental movement]].

Carson started her career as a biologist in the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s.  Her widely praised 1951 bestseller ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' won her financial security and recognition as a gifted writer.  Her next book, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', and the republished version of her first book, ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'', were also bestsellers.  Together, her sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life, from the shores to the surface to the deep sea.

In the late 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation and the environmental problems caused by synthetic [[pesticide]]s.  The result was ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented portion of the American public.  ''Silent Spring'' spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy<U+2014>leading to a nationwide ban on [[DDT]] and other pesticides<U+2014>and the [[grassroots]] environmental movement the book inspired led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].  Carson was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by [[Jimmy Carter]].

==Life and work==

[[File:RachelCarsonHomestead.jpg|thumb|left|Carson's childhood home now is preserved as the [[Rachel Carson Homestead]]]]

===Early life and education===
Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a small family farm near [[Springdale, Pennsylvania]], just up the [[Allegheny River]] from [[Pittsburgh]]. An avid reader, she also spent a lot of time exploring around her family's {{convert|65|acre|ha|sing=on}} farm. She began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight, and had her first story published at age eleven. She especially enjoyed the ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' (which carried her first published stories), the works of [[Beatrix Potter]], and the novels of [[Gene Stratton Porter]], and in her teen years, [[Herman Melville]], [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].  The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature.  Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby [[Parnassus, Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=7<U+2013>24}}</ref>

At the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as [[Chatham University]]), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement. Though admitted to graduate standing at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1929. After a summer course at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]], she continued her studies in [[zoology]] and [[genetics]] at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=27<U+2013>62}}</ref>

After her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in [[Raymond Pearl]]'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and ''[[Drosophila]]'', to earn money for tuition. After false starts with [[pit vipers]] and [[squirrel]]s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the [[pronephros]] in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, leaving Carson to care for her aging mother and making the financial situation even more critical. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the [[U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled "Romance Under the Waters". The series of fifty-two seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau<U+2014>a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=63<U+2013>79}}</ref>

Carson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the [[American civil service|civil service]] exam, she outscored all other applicants and in 1936 became only the second woman to be hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time, professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=79<U+2013>82}}</ref>

===Early career and publications===

At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=82<U+2013>5}}</ref>

In July 1937, the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' accepted a revised version of an essay, "The World of Waters", that she had originally written for her first fisheries bureau brochure; her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as "Undersea", was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house [[Simon & Schuster]], impressed by "Undersea", contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into book form. Several years of writing resulted in ''[[Under the Sea Wind]]'' (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued<U+2014>her features appeared in ''Sun Magazine'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', and ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=85<U+2013>113}}</ref>

Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the [[Fish and Wildlife Service]]) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the [[Manhattan Project]]. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of [[DDT]], a revolutionary new pesticide (lauded as the "insect bomb" after the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]) that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and ecological effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=114<U+2013>120}}</ref>

Carson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, supervising a small writing staff by 1945 and becoming chief editor of publications in 1949.  Though her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, [[Marie Rodell]]; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=121<U+2013>160}}</ref> 

[[Oxford University Press]] expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete the manuscript of what would become ''[[The Sea Around Us]]'' by early 1950.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=163<U+2013>4}}. An apocryphal story holds that the book was rejected by over twenty publishers before Oxford University Press. In fact, it may have only been sent to one other publisher before being accepted, though Rodell and Carson worked extensively to place chapters and excerpts in periodicals.</ref> Chapters appeared in ''[[Science Digest]]'' and the ''[[Yale Review]]''<U+2014>the latter chapter, "The Birth of an Island", winning the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize<U+2014>and nine chapters were serialized in ''[[The New Yorker]]''. ''The Sea Around Us'' remained on the ''[[New York Times]]''<U+2019> bestseller list for 86 weeks, was abridged by ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', won the 1952 [[National Book Award]] and the [[Burroughs Medal]], and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film to be based on ''The Sea Around Us''. The book's success led to the republication of ''Under the Sea Wind'', which also became a best-seller. With success came financial security, and Carson was able to give up her job in 1952 to concentrate on writing full time.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=164<U+2013>241}}</ref>

Carson was inundated with speaking engagements, [[fan mail]] and other correspondence regarding ''The Sea Around Us'', along with work on the documentary script that she had secured the right to review.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=206<U+2013>234}}</ref>  She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director and producer [[Irwin Allen]]; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as "a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue."<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=215<U+2013>6, 238<U+2013>9}}.  Quotation from a letter to Carson's film agent Shirley Collier, November 9, 1952.  Quoted in Lear, 239.</ref> She discovered, however, that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. Allen proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to produce a very successful documentary. It won the 1953 [[Oscar for Best Documentary]], but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=239<U+2013>240}}</ref>

===Relationship with Dorothy Freeman===

Carson moved with her mother to [[Southport Island, Maine]], in 1953, and in July of that year met [[Dorothy Freeman]] (1898<U+2013>1978)<U+2014>the beginning of an extremely close relationship that would last the rest of Carson's life. The nature of the relationship between Carson and Freeman has been the subject of much interest and speculation. It is probably best described as a [[romantic friendship]]. Carson met Freeman, a summer resident of the island along with her husband, after Freeman had written to Carson to welcome her. Freeman had read ''The Sea Around Us'', a gift from her son, and was excited to have the prominent author as a neighbor. Carson's biographer, Linda Lear, writes that "Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman."<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=248}}</ref>  She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would continue to share every summer for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=243<U+2013>288}}</ref>

Though Lear does not explicitly describe the relationship as romantic, others (such as the encyclopedia ''[[glbtq.com|glbtq]]''<ref name="letters_with_Freeman">Caryn E. Neumann, "[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/carson_r.html Carson, Rachel (1907<U+2013>1964)]", ''glbtq: an encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, & queer culture''. Retrieved February 22, 2007.</ref>) have noted that Carson and Freeman knew that their letters could be interpreted as [[lesbian]], even though "the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands."<ref>{{cite journal |author=Montefiore, Janet |title='The fact that possesses my imagination': Rachel Carson, Science and Writing |journal=Women: A Cultural Review |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=48 |year=2001}}</ref>  Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=255<U+2013>6}}</ref> Shortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as ''Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952<U+2013>1964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship'', edited by Freeman's granddaughter. According to one reviewer, the pair "fit Carolyn Heilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere'".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Tjossem, Sarah F. |title=Review of ''Always Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952<U+2013>1964'' |journal=Isis |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=687<U+2013>8 |year=1995 |doi=10.1086/357392}} quoting from: {{cite book |author=Heilbrun, Carolyn |title=Writing a Woman's Life |publisher=Ballantine |year=1988 |isbn=034536256X |page=108 }}</ref>

===''The Edge of the Sea'' and transition to conservation work===

In early 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=223<U+2013>244}}</ref> In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, ''[[The Edge of the Sea]]'', which focuses on life in [[coastal]] ecosystems (particularly along the [[Eastern Seaboard]]). It appeared in ''The New Yorker'' in two condensed installments shortly before the October 26 book release. By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well-established; ''The Edge of the Sea'' received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for ''The Sea Around Us''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=261<U+2013>276}}</ref>  

Through 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects<U+2014>including the script for an ''[[Omnibus (US TV series)|Omnibus]]'' episode, "Something About the Sky"<U+2014>and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address [[evolution]], but the publication of [[Julian Huxley]]'s ''Evolution in Action''<U+2014>and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic<U+2014>led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively entitled ''Remembrance of the Earth'' and became involved with [[The Nature Conservancy]] and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the "Lost Woods".<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=276<U+2013>300}}</ref>

Early in 1957, family tragedy struck a third time when one of the nieces she had cared for in the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on that responsibility, adopting the boy, alongside continuing to care for her aging mother; this took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]], to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=300<U+2013>9}}</ref>

By fall 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the [[USDA]] planned to eradicate [[Red imported fire ant|fire ants]], and other spraying programs involving [[chlorinated hydrocarbons]] and [[organophosphates]] were on the rise.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=305<U+2013>313}}</ref> For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.

===''Silent Spring''===

====Research and writing====

Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the [[military funding of science]] since [[World War II]].  It was the USDA's 1957 fire ant eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons.  The fire ant program involved aerial spraying of [[DDT]] and other pesticides (mixed with [[fuel oil]]), including the spraying of private land.  Landowners in Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12535&Itemid=47 |title=Obituary of Marjorie Spock |publisher=Ellsworthmaine.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2009-03-16}}</ref>

The Washington, D.C. chapter of the [[Audubon Society]] also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=312<U+2013>7}}</ref> Carson began the four-year project of what would become ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT.  She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist [[E. B. White]], and a number of journalists and scientists.  By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with ''[[Newsweek]]'' science journalist Edwin Diamond.  However, when ''The New Yorker'' commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project.  (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of ''Silent Spring''.)<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=317<U+2013>327}}</ref>

As her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides.  She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information.  From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as [[biological pest control]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=327<U+2013>336}}</ref>

By 1959, the [[USDA]]'s [[Agricultural Research Service]] responded to the criticism of Carson and others with a public service film, ''Fire Ants on Trial''; Carson characterized it as "flagrant [[propaganda]]" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially [[dieldrin]] and [[heptachlor]]) posed to humans and wildlife.  That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that attributed the recent decline in bird populations<U+2014>in her words, the "silencing of birds"<U+2014>to pesticide overuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=342<U+2013>6}}</ref>  That was also the year of the "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. [[cranberry|cranberries]] were found to contain high levels of the herbicide [[aminotriazole]] (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted.  Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying.  She also wondered about the possible "financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs".<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=358<U+2013>361}}</ref>

Research at the [[United States National Library of Medicine|Library of Medicine]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]] brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals.  Of particular significance was the work of [[National Cancer Institute]] researcher and founding director of the environmental cancer section [[Wilhelm Hueper]], who classified many pesticides as carcinogens.  Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide [[carcinogenesis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=355<U+2013>8}}</ref>

By 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly.  In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted.  However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of ''Silent Spring''.  As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a [[mastectomy]].  Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact [[malignant]] and the cancer had [[metastasized]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=360<U+2013>8}}</ref>  Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of ''The Sea Around Us'', and by a collaborative photo essay with [[Erich Hartmann (photographer)|Erich Hartmann]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=372<U+2013>3}}.  The photo essay, "The Sea", was published in ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', May/June 1961; Carson provided the captions for Hartmann's photographs.</ref>  Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on [[biological controls]] and investigations of a handful of new pesticides.  However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=376<U+2013>7}}</ref>

It was difficult finding a title for the book; "Silent Spring" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds.  By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: ''Silent Spring'' would be a metaphorical title for the entire book<U+2014>suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world<U+2014>rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377<U+2013>8, 386<U+2013>7, 389}}</ref>  With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at [[Houghton Mifflin]] arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover.  The final writing was the first chapter, "A Fable for Tomorrow", which was intended to provide a gentler introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic.  By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=390<U+2013>7}}</ref>

====Argument====

As biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson "quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the [[paradigm]] of [[scientific progress]] that defined [[postwar]] American culture."  The overriding theme of ''Silent Spring'' is the powerful<U+2014>and often negative<U+2014>effect humans have on the natural world.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166<U+2013>7}}</ref>

Carson's main argument is that [[pesticide]]s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed "[[biocide]]s", she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests.  DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well<U+2014>many of which are subject to [[bioaccumulation]].  Carson also accuses the [[chemical industry]] of intentionally spreading [[disinformation]] and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically.  Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=166<U+2013>172}}</ref>  About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:
{{quote|In laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how to classify them, but felt there was some "justification for considering them low grade hepatic cell carcinomas." Dr. Hueper [author of ''Occupational Tumors and Allied Diseases''] now gives DDT the definite rating of a "chemical carcinogen."<ref>Carson, ''Silent Spring'', 225</ref>}}

Carson predicts increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop [[resistance to pesticides]] while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated [[invasive species]]. The book closes with a call for a [[biotic material|biotic]] approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=169, 173}}</ref>

====Promotion and reception====

Carson and the others involved with publication of ''Silent Spring'' expected fierce criticism.  They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for [[libel]].  Carson was also undergoing [[radiation therapy]] to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics.  In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=397<U+2013>400}}</ref>

Most of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support.  Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May, 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of ''Silent Spring'' to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming ''New Yorker'' serialization.  Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]], a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=375, 377, 400<U+2013>7}}.  Douglas's dissenting opinion on the rejection of the case, ''Robert Cushman Murphy et al., v. Butler et al., from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, is from March 28, 1960.</ref>

Though ''Silent Spring'' had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in ''The New Yorker'', which began in the June 16, 1962 issue.  This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace.  Around that time Carson also learned that ''Silent Spring'' had been selected as the [[Book-of-the-Month]] for October; as she put it, this would "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like<U+2014>much less ''The New Yorker''."<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=407<U+2013>8}}.  Quotation (p. 408) from a June 13, 1962 letter from Carson to Dorothy Freeman.</ref>  Other publicity included a positive editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and excerpts of the serialized version in ''Audubon Magazine'', with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded.  The story of the birth defect-causing drug [[thalidomide]] broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=409<U+2013>413}}</ref>

[[File:Silent Spring Book-of-the-Month-Club edition.JPG|thumb|The [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] edition of ''[[Silent Spring]]'', including an endorsement by [[William O. Douglas]], had a first print run of 150,000 copies, two-and-a-half times the combined size of the two conventional printings of the initial release <ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=416, 419}}</ref>]]

In the weeks leading up to the September 27 publication there was strong opposition to ''Silent Spring''.  [[DuPont]] (a main manufacturer of DDT and [[2,4-D]]) and [[Velsicol Chemical Company]] (exclusive manufacturer of [[chlordane]] and [[heptachlor]]) were among the first to respond.  DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion.  Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as ''The New Yorker'' and ''Audubon Magazine'' unless the planned ''Silent Spring'' features were canceled.  Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously.  Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use.  However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process ''Silent Spring'' had undergone.  The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=412<U+2013>420}}</ref>

[[American Cyanamid]] biochemist [[Robert White-Stevens]] and former Cyanamid chemist [[Thomas Jukes]] were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=433<U+2013>4}}</ref>  According to White-Stevens, "If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth."<ref name="frontline_Cyanamid">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nature/disrupt/sspring.html Fooling with nature: special reports: Silent Spring revisited:]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref>  Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character.  White-Stevens labeled her "a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature",<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=434}}</ref> while former Secretary of Agriculture [[Ezra Taft Benson]]<U+2014>in a letter to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]<U+2014>reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was "probably a Communist".<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=429<U+2013>430}}.  Benson's supposed comments were widely repeated at the time, but have not been directly confirmed.</ref>

Many critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides.  Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem.<ref>{{harvnb|Murphy|2005|9}}</ref> In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in ''Silent Spring'' not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.<ref>Carson, ''Silent Spring'', 275</ref>

The academic community<U+2014>including prominent defenders such as [[H. J. Muller]], [[Loren Eisley]], [[Clarence Cottam]], and [[Frank Egler]]<U+2014>by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well.  The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as ''Silent Spring'' book sales.  Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the ''[[CBS Reports]]'' TV special "The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson" that aired April 3, 1963.  The program included segments of Carson reading from ''Silent Spring'' and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, "in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended."<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=437<U+2013>449}}; quotation from 449.</ref>  Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=449<U+2013>450}}</ref>  Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.<ref name="time100">[http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson03.html The Time 100: Scientists and Thinkers], accessed September 23, 2007</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|p=461}}</ref>
 
In one of her last public appearances, Carson had testified before President Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee.  The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims.<ref name="nwhp_bio">[http://web.archive.org/web/20051208074458/http://www.nwhp.org/tlp/biographies/carson/carson-bio.html 2003 National Women's History Month Honorees: Rachel Carlson]. Retrieved September 23, 2007.</ref>  Following the report's release, she also testified before a Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations.  Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them.  Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission.  She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and speeches at several dinners held in her honor.  In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the [[Audubon Medal]] (from the [[National Audubon Society]]), the [[Cullum Medal]] (from the [[American Geographical Society]]), and induction into the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=451<U+2013>461, 469<U+2013>473}}</ref>

=== Death ===
Weakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964.  Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe [[anemia]] from her radiation treatments and in March discovered that the cancer had reached her liver.  She died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on April 14, 1964.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=476<U+2013>480}}</ref>

She was interred at Parklawn Memorial Park and Menorah Gardens in [[Rockville, Maryland]].

==Legacy==
===Collected papers and posthumous publications===

Carson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to [[Yale University]], to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]].  Her longtime agent and literary executor [[Marie Rodell]] spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved of would be submitted to the archive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lear|1997|pp=467<U+2013>8, 477, 482<U+2013>3}}  See also the Beinecke [http://hdl.handle.net/10079/fa/beinecke.carson finding aid for the Rachel Carson Papers].</ref>

In 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: ''A Sense of Wonder''.  The essay, which was combined with photographs by [[Charles Pratt II|Charles Pratt]] and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the "lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world", which "are available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea and sky and their amazing life."<ref name="Murphy 25">Murphy, 25; quotations from ''A Sense of Wonder'', 95.  The essay was originally published in 1956 in ''Woman's Home Companion''.</ref>

In addition to the letters in ''Always Rachel'', in 1998 a volume of Carson's previously unpublished work was published as ''Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson'', edited by Linda Lear.  All of Carson's books remain in print.<ref name="Murphy 25"/>

===Grassroots environmentalism and the EPA===

Carson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement.  ''Silent Spring'', in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s.  According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, "''Silent Spring'' altered the balance of power in the world.  No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically."<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|p=3}}</ref>  Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the [[deep ecology]] movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s.  It was also influential on the rise of [[ecofeminism]] and on many feminist scientists.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=8<U+2013>9}}</ref>

Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world).  Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT.  The organization brought lawsuits against the government to "establish a citizen's right to a clean environment", and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's.  By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=46<U+2013>7}}</ref>

The creation, in 1970, of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light.  Until then, the same agency (the [[USDA]]) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a [[conflict of interest]], since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy.  Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as "the extended shadow of ''Silent Spring''".  Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcement of the 1972 [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]], was directly related to Carson's work.<ref>{{harvnb|Hynes|1989|pp=47<U+2013>8, 148<U+2013>163}}</ref>

===Criticisms of environmentalism and DDT restrictions===

Carson and the environmental movement were<U+2014>and continue to be<U+2014>criticized by some [[conservatives]] and [[libertarians]] as well as chemical industry trade groups and scientists, who argue that restrictions placed on pesticides, specifically DDT, have caused tens of millions of needless deaths and hampered agriculture, and more generally that environmental regulation unnecessarily restricts [[economic freedom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|p=217}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Baum|first=Rudy M.|date=June 4, 2007|title=Rachel Carson|journal=Chemical and Engineering News|publisher=American Chemical Society|volume=85|issue=23|page=5|url=http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/cen/85/i23/html/8523editor.html}}</ref><ref name="Conservative criticism of Carson">Examples of recent criticism include:<br />(a) Rich Karlgaard, "[http://blogs.forbes.com/digitalrules/2007/05/but_her_heart_w.html But Her Heart Was Good]", Forbes.com, May 18, 2007.

Carson's vocal expressions of concern about the [[DDT#Effects on human health|human health effects]] and [[DDT#Environmental impact|environmental impact]] of DDT has come under the most intense fire. Political scientist Charles Rubin was one of the most vociferous critics in the 1980s and 1990s, though he accused her merely of selective use of source and fanaticism (rather than the more severe criticism Carson received upon ''Silent Spring'''s release). In the 2000s, critics have claimed that Carson is responsible for millions of [[malaria]] deaths, because of the DDT bans her work prompted. Biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle claims these estimates unrealistic, even assuming that Carson can be "blamed" for worldwide DDT policies,<ref>{{harvnb|Lytle|2007|pp=220<U+2013>8}}</ref> and [[John Quiggin]] and Tim Lambert have written that "the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted."<ref name="quig">{{cite journal |author=John Quiggin, Tim Lambert |title=Rehabilitating Carson |journal=Prospect |issue=146 |pages= |date=24 May 2008 |url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10175}}</ref>  Carson never actually called for an outright ban on DDT.<ref>She instead argued in ''Silent Spring'' that:

<blockquote>No responsible person contends that insect-borne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story<U+2014>the defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our very means of fighting. (p. 266)</blockquote>

She noted that "Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes" (p. 267) and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: "Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity'<U+2026>Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible." (p. 275)</ref>

Some experts have argued that restrictions placed on the agricultural use of DDT have increased its effectiveness as a tool for battling malaria. According to pro-DDT advocate [[Amir Attaran]] the result of the 2004 [[Stockholm Convention]] banning DDT's use in agriculture ''"is arguably better than the status quo ... For the first time, there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector control only, meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes will be slower than before."''<ref>[http://www.malaria.org/DDTpage.html Malaria Foundation International]. Retrieved March 15, 2006.</ref> But though Carson's legacy has been closely tied to DDT, [[Roger Bate]] of the DDT advocacy organization [[Africa Fighting Malaria]] warns that "A lot of people have used Carson to push their own agendas. We just have to be a little careful when you're talking about someone who died in 1964."<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html Rachel Carson and DDT], ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]'', September 21, 2007.
