'''James Blake Miller''' (born July 10, 1984 in [[Pike County, Kentucky]]) is a [[United States Marine Corps]] veteran of the [[Iraq War]], who fought in the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] and was dubbed the "[[Marlboro Man]]" in addition to the "Marlboro Marine", after an iconic, close-up photograph of his scarred, dirt-smeared, battle-weary face, with a cigarette in his mouth during the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] was published on the front page of more than 150 newspapers in the [[United States]] in 2004.<ref name=LAT111107>Luis Sinco, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/photography/la-na-marlboro11nov11,0,2214837.story Two lives blurred together by a photo], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 11, 2007.</ref>

Because of his struggles with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], Miller is now separated from his wife and family and currently lives alone. He is unable to discuss certain things that happened in [[Fallujah]], and has joined the [[Highwaymen Motorcycle Club|Highwaymen]], a motorcycle club under constant scrutiny by law enforcement.<ref name=LAT111207>Luis Sinco, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/photography/la-na-marlboro12nov12,0,3838305,full.story Rescue operation aims to save a wounded warrior], ''Los Angeles Times'', November 12, 2007.</ref>

==Early years==
Miller grew up in [[Jonancy, Kentucky]]. As a boy, he embraced religion, even going so far as to become an [[ordained minister]]. Not interested in working in the [[coal mine|coal mines]], Miller joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] with the intention to eventually work in [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]].<ref name=LAT111107/> Before shipping off, Miller took his [[high school]] sweetheart, Jessica Holbrooks, to the mountains outside [[Pikeville, Kentucky]] and asked her to marry him after his return; she agreed.<ref name=LAT111207/>

==Iraq War==
===Second Battle of Fallujah===
Miller became part of [[Charlie Company]] of the [[1st Battalion 8th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[8th Marine Regiment (United States)|8th Marine Regiment]], a unit which took part in the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]] in November 2004. Entering the city on November 8, 2004, they encountered heavy fire almost immediately, and were pinned down all night at a [[traffic circle]]. In the morning, the unit took fire again and elements took cover in a house. After securing the house, Miller, the platoon's radioman, called in [[tank]] fire on a nearby house.  In the moments after the tank blasts shook the home in which they were located, [[embedded journalist|embedded]] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' photographer [[Luis Sinco]] took a photo of Miller propped against a wall, smoking a cigarette; Miller's face was smeared with camouflage paint, blood trickled from his right ear and bridge of his nose, and he was momentarily deafened by the cannon blasts, [[Thousand-yard stare|staring]] at the sunrise. In explaining the photograph, Sinco stated that ''"His expression caught my eye. To me, it said: terrified, exhausted, and glad just to be alive. I recognized that look because that's how I felt too."'' Miller was 20 at the time.<ref name=LAT111107/>

===Marlboro Marine===
Sinco's photograph of Miller appeared on the front page of over 150 newspapers. [[CBS Evening News]] anchor [[Dan Rather]] singled out the photo for its excellence, and turned the then-unidentified Marine into a celebrity. Sinco was told to find the Marine for a follow-up story and tracked down Miller four days later in an auditorium near Fallujah's civic center. Miller was embarrassed about the photo's notoriety, but shared information with Sinco. The two would remain friends thereafter.<ref name=LAT111107/>

After his identity was made public, people sent him [[care package]]s, including lots of cigarettes; President [[George W. Bush]] sent [[cigar]]s, candy and memorabilia from the [[White House]].  The forward command center soon featured a large blowup of the photo.  The Commanding General of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], [[Richard F. Natonski]], made a special trip to see Miller, to Miller's surprise. The general shook Miller's hand and let him know that, because Americans had "connected" with his photo, and nobody wanted to see him wounded or dead, he was offered a trip home. Miller turned down the offer because he did not want to leave his comrades behind.<ref name=LAT111107/>

The photograph was nominated by [[Slate]] in 2011 for a list of "New Classics", products of the culture since 2000 that will withstand the test of time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/new_classics/2011/10/the_new_classics_the_most_enduring_books_shows_movies_and_ideas_since_2000_.single.html|author=[[Heather Murphy]]|title=The New Classics|publisher=[[Slate]]|date=2011-11-06|accessdate=2011-11-07}}</ref>

==After the Iraq War==
===Marriage===
After his tour, Miller returned to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]] in [[North Carolina]]. He was married in June 2005 to Holbrooks in a civil ceremony; the couple had a lavish reception at a country club in [[Prestonsburg, Kentucky]], paid for by donations from admirers of Miller throughout the [[United States]].

===Problems with posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miller began to suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]; he had nightmares, and while cleaning his [[shotgun]], he blacked out only to regain consciousness when his wife called his name, finding himself pointing the shotgun at her. He reported problems to his superiors, who promised to help. Problems came to a head while he was deployed to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in September 2005, to help assist with recovery in [[New Orleans]] in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. With a second large storm, [[Hurricane Rita]], moving in to the area, the Marines were ordered to remain out at sea for safety reasons. On board a [[United States Navy]] ship, he physically attacked a sailor who whistled in a way that reminded Miller of a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. After attacking the sailor, he awoke to find himself in the ship's [[brig]].<ref name=LAT111107/>

===Medical discharge from the military===
On November 10, 2005, Miller was [[military discharge|medically discharged]] with a "personality disorder", exactly one year after his iconic picture made worldwide news.<ref name=LAT111107/>

===Return to civilian life===
The Millers returned to [[Kentucky]]. He and Jessica took time off while living on a monthly disability benefit of about $2,500. Miller bought a [[motorcycle]] for long rides. Although Miller had hoped to go into law enforcement, his [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and medical discharge made it impossible as no one could trust him with a weapon. Hearing that he had encountered problems, donors from across the [[United States]] and local businesses banded together to fund a traditional wedding ceremony for the Millers. Blake and Jessica renewed their vows on June 3, 2006, in a ceremony at a hilltop clubhouse. In lieu of a honeymoon, the couple went to [[Washington, D.C.]] at the invitation of the National Mental Health Association, which wanted to honor Miller for going public about his [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and have him visit congressmen to share his experience. 

Luis Sinco, the photographer who had made Miller famous, had been following the Millers for some time to do a follow-up story; at this point Sinco decided to push the line of professional journalism and take Miller to get help.<ref name=LAT111107/> Sinco took Miller to Errera Community Care Center, a veterans' treatment program, in [[West Haven, Connecticut]]. Miller checked into the program, and his Veterans Benefits paid for the treatment. Miller initially opened up to therapy sessions, but did not do as well in group therapy; he began talking with his wife, and dropped out just two months into a program that was supposed to last six months to a year.<ref name=LAT111207/>

Miller joined a motorcycle club called the [[Highwaymen_Motorcycle_Club|Highwaymen]], which was under scrutiny by law enforcement but appealed to Miller because their uniforms and codes of conduct reminded him of the Marines.<ref name=LAT111207/>

==Family==
Miller's father, Jimmy Miller, lives in [[Kentucky]]; he is estranged from his mother. Miller has two younger brothers, Todd and Mike.<ref name=LAT111207/> Miller's grandfather had served in the [[Korean War]], suffered from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and died at the age of 35.<ref name=LAT111107/><ref>[http://www.mediastorm.org/0020.htm Mediastorm website]</ref>
