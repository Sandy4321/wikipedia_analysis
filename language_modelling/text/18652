'''Esther Drummond''' is a fictional character in the science fiction series ''[[Torchwood]]'', portrayed by American actress [[Alexa Havins]]. Havins is one of several American actors to join ''Torchwood'' in its fourth series, ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'', which was co-produced by ''Torchwood''{{'}}s original British network [[BBC1]] and the American premium television network [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]. The character appears in every episode of the fourth series in addition to a prequel novel, ''The Men Who Sold the World''.

Within the series narrative, Esther is a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) watch analyst who becomes aware of the defunct British [[Torchwood Institute]] on "Miracle Day", when it is discovered that no one can die. Alongside her CIA colleague [[Rex Matheson]] she joins forces with the last two remaining Torchwood agents to investigate the phenomenon. Esther's standing as a desk-bound computer and technology expert puts her in contrast with the tougher and more action-orientated characters in the series. By the ''Miracle Day'' finale, Esther has become a more competent field agent, but is murdered by the group's enemies in an attempt to stop them progressing with their mission.

Havins was influenced in her decision to accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer [[Russell T Davies]] as a means of introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of ''Torchwood''. Havins stated the character to have an [[unrequited love]] for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.

===Literature===
Esther features as a supporting character in the novel ''The Men Who Sold The World'', which is featured as a prequel to ''Torchwood: Miracle Day''. In the novel, Esther aids Rex in his mission to track down a CIA contigent who have gone rogue with dangerous alien weaponry. Reviewing the novel, ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' columnist Alasdair Stuart commented that author [[Guy Adams]] provided "interesting, and brave, context to Rex<U+2019>s relationship with Esther." According to Stuart, ''The Men Who Sold The World'' demonstrated that "Rex knows he manipulates her and doesn<U+2019>t particularly care. She<U+2019>s an asset, just one he can use better and faster than most".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2011/08/18/blog-torchwood-book-review/|title=Torchwood book review|publisher=''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]''|last=Alasdair|first=Stuart|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=18 August 2011}}</ref>

Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the "techie" of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons.

Esther has a romantic interest in [[Rex Matheson]] ([[Mekhi Phifer]]), who she idealises and looks up to.

During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies.

He concluded by saying that "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" is something ''Torchwood'' has always excelled at.<ref name=Jeffrey/> Neela Debnath of ''[[The Independent]]'' commented that her death was sad because the "character went through so much" and that "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/09/15/review-of-torchwood-%E2%80%98the-blood-line%E2%80%99/|title=Review of Torchwood <U+2018>The Blood Line<U+2019>|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|last=Debnath|first=Neela|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=3 March 2012}}</ref> Conversely, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the "one big, emotional moment of the finale" it came across to him as "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something to go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/09/torchwood-recap-all-over-with-lots-of-shouting.html|title='Torchwood' recap: All over, with lots of shouting|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=10 September 2011|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref> Blair Marnell of [[CraveOnline]] also notes in his review of the series finale that "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" and felt that it would have been better had the characters departed in symmetry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/tv/reviews/174088-torchwood-miracle-day-110-the-blood-line|title=Torchwood: Miracle Day 1.10 'The Blood Line'|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|last=Marnell|first=Blair|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref>
