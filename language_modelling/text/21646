'''Kilkeel''' ({{Irish derived place name|Cill Chaoil|narrow church/church of the narrow}})<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/67037.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland]</ref><ref>[http://www.placenamesni.org/resultsdetail.phtml?entry=15234 Placenames NI]</ref> is a small town, [[townland]] and [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] in [[County Down]], Northern Ireland. It is the main fishing port on the Down coast, and its harbour houses one of the largest fishing fleets in Ireland. It had a population of 6,338 people according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]]. The town contains the ruins of a 14th-century church and fort, winding streets and terraced shops.

==Geography==
Kilkeel sits on a [[plain]] south of the [[Mourne Mountains]]. It stretches along the southern coast of County Down, from [[Carlingford Lough]] in the west to [[Annalong]] in the east. The town is at the foot of a river that flows southwards from the Mournes. Four miles southwest of Kilkeel is [[Cranfield Point]], a small peninsula that marks the southernmost point of the county. The settlement is named after the [[townland]] of Kilkeel, in which it began. Over time, the urban area has grown into the neighbouring townlands.

==History==
[[Image:kilkeel narrow church.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Picture of "Narrow Church"]]

Kilkeel takes its name from the old church overlooking the town, it being the [[anglicised]] version of the Gaelic 'Cill Chaoil' meaning "Narrow Church" or "The Church of/in the Narrow Place." The name may be drawn from the church location on a narrow site above the town. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} The church was constructed in 1388 and dedicated to "St Colman Del Mourne." It was thought to be the principal Church in a group which included Kilmegan and Kilcoo despite the fact that Kilkeel was very sparsely populated in the [[Middle Ages]]. There are references to Kilkeel as a Christian settlement as far back as the 11th century. Kilkeel is the capital of the ancient [[Kingdom of Mourne]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The cemetery attached to the church was used for burials until 1916. The last burials at the cemetery were victims of a collision between two [[Steamboat|steamers]] the Retriever and the [[SS Connemara]] in [[Carlingford Lough]].

On 30 May 1918 a fleet of Kilkeel fishing boats was sunk by the [[U-boat]] [[UB-64]] under the command of [[Otto von Schrader]]. The boats sunk, 12 miles off the coast of County Down, included the ''Jane Gordon'', ''Cyprus'', ''Never Can Tell'', ''St Mary'', ''Sparkling Wave'', ''Lloyds'', ''Marianne Macrum'' and the motor vessel ''Honey Bee''. Only two boats, ''Moss Rose'' and ''Mary Joseph'', were not sunk and the crews returned to port on those boats.<ref>{{cite book|author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan|author2=Breen, Colin|year=2007|title=Maritime Ireland.
