'''New Jersey Route 180''' was a former alignment of [[New Jersey Route 72]] along Bay Avenue in [[Manahawkin, New Jersey|Manahawkin]]. Route 180 ran from [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|U.S. Route 9]] in Manahawkin eastward to an intersection with Route 72 intersection east of Manahawkin. The highway was assigned in 1968, when the [[New Jersey State Highway Department]] built a bypass of Route 72. The route's original alignment was then redesignated as Route 180. 

On April 16, 1980, the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] traded with [[Ocean County, New Jersey]] control of NJ 180 for control of [[New Jersey Route 35]] south of [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey|Seaside Heights]]. The DOT originally proposed Route 180 be turned into '''Ocean County Route 680''', maintained by Ocean County, but the county redesignated the highway as '''Ocean County Route 50'''.

== Route description ==
Route 180 began at an intersection with U.S. Route 9 in Manahawkin. The route headed eastward along Bay Avenue, paralleling the original highway to the north. Route 180 intersected with County Route 20 (Jennings Road) to the south, serving as the northern terminus. A short distance later, Route 180 intersected with County Route 6 (Mill Creek Road), and several local roads. After the local roads, the highway provided the southern terminus of County Route 14 (Hillard Boulevard).<ref name="sld"/>

The highway continued eastward along a stream, intersecting with local roads. Route 180 continued a short distance, ending at an interchange with Route 72 in Stafford Township.<ref name="sld"/> 

== History ==
Route 180 was originally an alignment of New Jersey Route 72. However, Route 72 had a former designation of its own, New Jersey State Highway Route S-40, a prefixed spur highway of State Highway Route 40 (now [[New Jersey Route 70]]). Originally, the county maintained the alignment of Route 72 west of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] to Long Beach Boulevard. The rest of Route 72 was constructed from 1930 to 1936, and after 1941, the stretch of Route 72 that would later become Route 180, was constructed.<ref name="s40">{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/4.html#s40|title=S40|last=Alpert|first=Steve|coauthors=Moraeski, Dan|date=2009|work=Moraeski, Dan|publisher=Alps' Roads|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>

State Highway Route S-40, which was assigned in the [[1927 renumbering (New Jersey)|1927 renumbering of state highways]], remained intact after 1941 until January 1, 1953. The highway was redesignated as Route 72 on that day, and State Highway Route S-40 was decommissioned along with State Highway Route 40. The highway remained intact for several years, until 1968, when the New Jersey State Highway Department bypassed the original alignment of Route 72. That year, Route 72's original alignment was redesignated as Route 180.<ref name="sr72">{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/6.html#72|title=72|last=Alpert|first=Steve|coauthors=Moraeski, Dan|date=2009|work=Moraeski, Dan|publisher=Alps' Roads|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>

Route 180 remained intact for several years along the alignment of Bay Avenue. On April 16, 1980, the New Jersey Department of Transportation traded maintainence and control of Route 180 to Ocean County for the alignment of New Jersey Route 35 south of Seaside Heights. The Department of Transportation proposed County Route 680, a county highway partly using the "x80" designation. Instead, Ocean County renumbered the highway as County Route 50.<ref name="sr180">{{cite web|url=http://www.alpsroads.net/roads/nj/log/10.html#180|title=180|last=Alpert|first=Steve|coauthors=Moraeski, Dan|date=2009|work=Moraeski, Dan|publisher=Alps' Roads|accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>
