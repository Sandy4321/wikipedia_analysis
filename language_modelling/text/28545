"'''Momentum Deferred'''" is the fourth [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe  (season 2)|second season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. Screenwriters [[Zack Stentz]] and [[Ashley Edward Miller]] wrote the episode, and co-executive producer [[Joe Chappelle]] directed it. The episode followed the theft of [[cryogenic]]ally-frozen heads by [[shapeshifter]]s from the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] in their search for a specific head, while the Fringe team attempts to prevent this. Meanwhile, [[Olivia Dunham|Olivia]] struggles to remember her conversation with [[List of Fringe characters#William Bell|William Bell]] (guest actor [[Leonard Nimoy]]) that took place in the [[There's More Than One of Everything|season one finale]]. "Momentum Deferred" marked the first appearances of guest actors [[Theresa Russell]], [[Sebastian Roch<U+00E9>]], and [[Ryan McDonald]].

It first aired on October 8, 2009 in the United States, and was watched by more than 6.02 viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising the new revelations about the shapeshifters, the parallel universe, as well as the much-anticipated conversation between Olivia and William Bell.

==Plot==
A shipment of heads stored in cryogenic storage is hijacked, though one of the hijackers is killed by a guard, and bleeds a mix of blood and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], identifying him as a shapeshifter from the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]. The Fringe division discovers an undamaged device they believe is used by the shapeshifters to take another's identity. [[Olivia Dunham]] ([[Anna Torv]]) gives the device to [[List of Fringe characters#Nina Sharp|Nina Sharp]] ([[Blair Brown]]) at Massive Dynamic; with the intact device, they can use it to examine the device of the first shapeshifter that tried to kill Olivia in the episode "[[A New Day in the Old Town]]". They are unaware that this shapeshifter has taken the form of Olivia's partner, [[List of Fringe characters#Charlie Francis|Charlie]] ([[Kirk Acevedo]]), ordered to find out what she learned from [[List of Fringe characters#William Bell|William Bell]] ([[Leonard Nimoy]]) when she was temporarily taken to the parallel universe.

[[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter]] ([[John Noble]]) remembers that one of his former patients [[List of Fringe characters#Rebecca Kibner|Rebecca Kibner]] ([[Theresa Russell]]), while under a heavy dose of mind-altering drugs, had witnessed events in the parallel universe including the presence of the shapeshifters. To try to learn more, they approach Rebecca and ask for her help, who is happy to participate. After outfitting her with electrodes and injecting her with more drugs, Walter starts the process by clanging a bell; to everyone's surprise, this causes Olivia to pass out.

The bell has caused Olivia to recall her conversation with Bell in the parallel universe. There, Bell warned Olivia of a "great storm" that was coming, and that she must stop a man who is trying to open a gateway between the two universes, providing Olivia with an icon symbol and a hand-written name to remember. Walter and Peter help revive Olivia who immediately demands to see Nina. As Olivia leaves, Walter returns with Rebecca to her home.

Nina, initially doubtful that Olivia met Bell, recognizes the "great storm" phrase, and attempts to help Olivia in any way possible.  As Olivia recounts the name of another cryogenics facility from Bell's note, she receives a text message from Charlie warning her that Nina is the shapeshifter. She leaves and regroups with Charlie, but in a side alley, is alerted by her phone that Massive Dynamic's analysis of the first device was completed, and reveals Charlie as the shapeshifter. Too late, Olivia realizes she has told Charlie the location of the cryogenics facility, and Charlie relays this to another agent. After a brief fight for her life, Olivia shoots and kills the shapeshifter. [[List of Fringe characters#Phillip Broyles|Broyles]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) helps to comfort Olivia that she had to kill the man she thought was Charlie. At the episode's conclusion, the head with Bell's symbol is reattached to the body of a shapeshifter.

One writer explained Kibner and Walter's past relationship had not been a long term affair, but instead more of a "little fling".<ref name=commentary/> The episode also marked the first appearance of Canadian actor [[Ryan McDonald]] as recurring character [[List of Fringe characters#Brandon Fayette|Brandon Fayette]], a Massive Dynamic scientist.<ref name=avclub/> According to the episode's writers, the character is based on a man who works at the production company [[Bad Robot]].<ref name=commentary/>

The episode was shot in [[Vancouver]] during the summer, where temperatures were over 100 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]. Executive producer [[Jeff Pinkner]] commented that despite the heat, guest actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," while co-star [[Joshua Jackson]] joked that "[Nimoy's] wife said he practices [[biofeedback]], so he knows how to control his body temperature".<ref name=latimes1>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/08/tca-press-tour-nimoy-a-cool-customer-on-fringe.html |title=TCA Press Tour: Nimoy a cool customer on 'Fringe' |publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |first=Greg |last=Braxton |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref> Director Joe Chappelle called the episode "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving a lot of issues and a lot of questions.

Not knowing when his next billed episode would be, Nimoy said in an interview before "Momentum Deferred" aired that he's "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future.

Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and [[Reverberation|reverbed]] them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some "reversed" ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as "a little ominous" but not "too cliche".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://designingsound.org/2010/07/bruce-tanis-special-cutting-weird-things-on-fringe/ |title=Bruce Tanis Special: Cutting Weird Things on <U+201C>Fringe<U+201D>  |publisher=''Designing Sound'' |first=Miguel|last=Isaza|date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>

===Reviews===
Josh Wigler from [[MTV]].com loved the revelations from the conversation with William Bell, along with the appearance of shapeshifters. He thought the episode was ''Fringe'' "at its absolute finest," as the "mystery-of-the-week and the overarching plot worked in complete harmony with one another, proving that "Fringe" is entirely capable of delivering on both a serialized and episodic basis".<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/10/08/fringe-episode-204-momentum-deferred/ |title='Fringe' Episode 2.04: 'Momentum Deferred' |publisher=[[MTV]].com |first=Josh|last=Wigler |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Ken Tucker praised guest actor Leonard Nimoy's "terrific, coolly-controlled performance," and wrote that he continued "to admire the way Fringe can mind-meld its scientific fiction with workplace-family drama and light comedy, juggling an increasing number of characters and subplots, while still maintaining a strong narrative through-line".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/10/09/fringe-leonard-nimoy-william-bell/ |title='Fringe': Olivia eats worms, Leonard Nimoy rings a Bell |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |first=Ken|last=Tucker |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'s}} Noel Murray graded the episode a B+, explaining that the episode was much better than the previous week and also praising the introduction of two new characters and the long awaited meeting between Olivia and William Bell. Murray concluded his review somewhat negatively, "If the whole episode had maintained the "yes we're aware this is kinda nutsy" tone of that one great line, I'd have bumped it up one more notch to the A-level. I'm holding back only because "Momentum Deferred" was such an info-dump, and played a fraction too soberly".<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/momentum-deferred,33885/ |title="Momentum Deferred" |publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]'''' |first=Noel|last=Murray|date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> Writing for Mania.com, Stephen Lackey thought the alternate universe plotline was risky because it had the potential to cause ''Fringe'' to "mak[e] a complex plot convoluted by taking off in flights of fancy with the writing and forgetting what has been written before," but he does not believe that point has been reached yet. He also thought the meeting between Olivia and Bell "wasn't as epic as it has been teased," but enjoyed the "fascinating" cliffhanger at the end, ultimately calling it a "good" episode.<ref name=mania>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/fringe-momentum-deferred-review_article_118127.html |title=Fringe: Momentum Deferred Review |first=Stephen|last=Lackey |publisher=Mania.com |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2011-03-13}}</ref> Website blogger [[io9]] listed "Momentum Deferred" as one of the "crucial" episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/5652372/want-to-get-into-fringe-these-are-the-episodes-you-need-to-watch |title=Want to get into "Fringe"?
