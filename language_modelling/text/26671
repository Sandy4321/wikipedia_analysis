'''Tin''' is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Sn''' ([[Latin (language)|L.]] '''''Stannum''''') and [[atomic number]] 50. This silvery, malleable [[poor metal]] that is not easily [[oxidation|oxidized]] in air and resists [[corrosion]], is found in many [[alloy]]s and is used to coat other metals to prevent corrosion. Tin is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], where it occurs as an [[oxide]].

== Notable characteristics ==
Tin is a malleable, ductile, highly [[crystal]]line, silvery-white [[metal]] whose crystal structure causes a strange crackling sound known as the "tin cry" when a bar of tin is bent (caused by crystals breaking). This metal resists corrosion from [[distilled]], sea and soft [[tap water]], but can be attacked by strong [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]s, and by [[acid salt]]s. Tin acts as a [[catalyst]] when [[oxygen]] is in solution and helps accelerate chemical attack.

Tin forms the dioxide SnO<sub>2</sub> when it is heated in the presence of [[air]]. SnO<sub>2</sub>, in turn, is feebly acidic and forms stannate (SnO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup>) salts with [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] oxides. Tin can be highly polished and is used as a protective coat for other metals in order to prevent corrosion or other chemical action. This metal combines directly with [[chlorine]] and oxygen and displaces [[hydrogen]] from dilute acids. Tin is malleable at ordinary temperatures but is brittle when it is heated.

== Allotropes ==
Solid tin has two [[allotrope]]s at normal pressure.  At low temperatures it exists as ''gray'' or alpha tin, which has a cubic [[crystal structure]] similar to [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].  When warmed above 13.2 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] it changes into ''white'' or beta tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure.  It slowly changes back to the gray form when cooled, which is called the ''[[tin pest]]'' or ''tin disease''.  However, this transformation is affected by impurities such as [[aluminium]] and [[zinc]] and can be prevented from occurring through the addition of [[antimony]] or [[bismuth]].

== Applications ==
Tin bonds readily to [[iron]], and has been used for coating [[lead]] or zinc and [[steel]] to prevent [[corrosion]]. Tin-plated [[steel]] containers are widely used for [[food preservation]], and this forms a large part of the market for metallic tin. Speakers of British English call them "tins"; Americans call them "[[canning|cans]]". One thus-derived use of the slang term "[[tinnie]]" or "tinny" means "can of beer". The [[tin whistle]] is so called because it was first mass-produced in tin-plated steel.

Other uses:
*Some important tin [[alloys]] are: [[bronze]], [[bell metal]], [[Babbitt metal]], [[die casting]] alloy, [[pewter]], [[phosphor bronze]], soft [[solder]], and [[White metal]].
*The most important salt formed is [[Tin(II) chloride|stannous chloride]], which has found use as a reducing agent and as a [[mordant]] in the [[calico printing]] process. Electrically conductive coatings are produced when tin salts are sprayed onto [[glass]]. These coatings have been used in panel lighting and in the production of frost-free [[windshield]]s.
*Window glass is most often made via floating molten [[glass]] on top of molten tin (creating [[float glass]]) in order to make a flat surface (this is called the "[[Pilkington process]]").
*Tin is one of the two basic elements used since the Rennaisance in the manufacture of organ pipes (the other being lead).  The amount of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, tin being the most tonally resonant of all metals.
*Tin is also used in [[solder]]s for joining [[plumbing|pipe]]s or [[electric circuit]]s, in [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] alloys, in glass-making, and in a wide range of tin chemical applications.  Although of higher melting point than a [[lead]]-tin alloy, the use of pure tin or tin alloyed with other metals in these applications is rapidly supplanting the use of the previously common lead&ndash;containing alloys in order to eliminate the problems of toxicity caused by lead.
*Tin foil was once a common wrapping material for foods and drugs; replaced in 1910 by the use of [[aluminium]] foil, which is now commonly referred to as ''tin foil''. Hence one use of the slang term "[[tinnie]]" or "tinny" for a small retail package of a drug such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] or for a can of beer.

Tin becomes a [[superconductor]] below 3.72 [[Kelvin|K]]. In fact, tin was one of the first superconductors to be studied; the [[Meissner effect]], one of the characteristic features of superconductors, was first discovered in superconducting tin crystals. The [[niobium]]-tin compound [[Niobium-tin|Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn]] is commercially used as wires for [[superconducting magnet]]s, due to the material's high [[critical temperature#In Superconductivity|critical temperature]] (18 K) and critical magnetic field (25 [[Tesla (unit)|T]]). A superconducting magnet weighing only a couple of [[kilogram]]s is capable of producing magnetic fields comparable to a conventional [[electromagnet]] weighing tons.

== History ==
Tin ([[Anglo-Saxon language |Anglo-Saxon]], ''tin'', [[Latin]] ''stannum'') is one of the earliest metals known and was used as a component of [[bronze]] from antiquity. Because of its hardening effect on [[copper]], tin was used in bronze implements as early as [[3,500 BC]]. Tin mining is believed to have started in [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]] ( esp [[Dartmoor tin-mining|Dartmoor]]) in Classical times, and a thriving tin trade developed with the civilizations of the [[Mediterranean]]{{citation needed}}. However the pure metal was not used until about [[600 BC]]. The last Cornish Tin Mine, at [[South Crofty]] near [[Camborne]] closed in 1998 bringing 4000 years of mining in Cornwall to an end.

The word "tin" has cognates in many Germanic and Celtic languages. The American Heritage Dictionary speculates that the word was borrowed from a pre-Indo-European language.

In modern times, the word "tin" is often (improperly) used as a generic phrase for any silvery metal that comes in thin sheets. Most everyday objects that are commonly called tin, such as [[aluminium foil]], [[beverage can]]s, and [[tin can]]s, are actually made of [[steel]] or [[aluminium]], although tin cans do contain a small coating of tin to inhibit rust. Likewise, so-called "tin [[toy]]s" are usually made of steel, and may or may not have a small coating of tin to inhibit rust.

== Occurrence ==
About 35 countries [[Mining|mine]] tin throughout the world.  Nearly every continent has an important tin-mining country.  Tin is produced by reducing the [[ore]] with [[coal]] in a [[reverberatory furnace]].  This metal is a relatively scarce element with an abundance in the [[Earth]]'s [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of about 2 [[part per million|ppm]], compared with 94 ppm for zinc, 63 ppm for copper, and 12 ppm for lead.  Most of the world's tin is produced from [[placer_mining|placer]] deposits; at least one-half comes from [[Southeast Asia]].  The only [[mineral]] of commercial importance as a source of tin is [[cassiterite]] (Sn[[oxygen|O]]<sub>2</sub>), although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex [[sulfide]]s such as [[stannite]], [[cylindrite]], [[franckeite]], [[canfieldite]], and [[teallite]]. Secondary, or scrap, tin is also an important source of the metal.

[[Tasmania]] hosts some important deposits of historical importance, most importantly [[Mount Bischoff]] and [[Renison Bell]].

== Biologic effects of organic tin compounds==
The small amount of tin that is found in canned foods is not harmful to humans. Certain organic tin compounds, [[organotin]], such as triorganotins (see [[tributyltin oxide]]) are toxic and are used as industrial [[fungicide]]s and [[bactericide]]s.
