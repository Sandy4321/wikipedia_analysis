'''Alice Augusta Ball''' (July 24, 1892 <U+2013> December 31, 1916) was an [[African American]] [[chemist]] who developed an injectable oil extract that was the most effective treatment of [[leprosy]] until the 1940s.<ref name="Black Past" />  She was also the first woman and first African American to graduate from the [[University of Hawaii]] with a master's degree.<ref name="Women Chemists" />

==Early life and education==
Alice Augusta Ball was born on July 24, 1892 in [[Seattle, Washington]] to James Presley and Laura Louise (Howard) Ball.<ref name=Jackson>{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Miles|title=African Americans in Hawai'i|journal=Social Process in Hawai'i|year=2004|volume=43|pages=168<U+2013>174|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B2jkQENX8rMZcmpQZ3RQMUs5YUU/edit|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>  Her family was considered middle class to upper-middle class as Ball's father was a newspaper editor, photographer, and a lawyer.<ref name=Jackson /> Her grandfather, [[James Presley Ball|James Ball]] Sr., was also a famous photographer and one of the first African Americans in the United States to learn to [[daguerreotype]].<ref name="Chem Matters">{{cite journal|last=Wermager|first=Paul|author2=Carl Heltzel|title=Alice A.

After returning to Seattle, Ball attended Seattle High School and received top grades in the sciences. She graduated from Seattle High School in 1910 and entered the [[University of Washington]] to study chemistry.<ref name="Women Chemists">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Jeannette|title=African American Women Chemists|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-974288-2|pages=19<U+2013>24|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=uomdpaHWaC0C&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=alice+augusta+ball&source=bl&ots=Q38HrPe7EG&sig=0YCXw8rl6k6MmnfHQajNrs3KQiU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bpiXUYqoB4ODqgGgoIGgDA&ved=0CHsQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&q=alice%20ball&f=false}}</ref><ref name=GBook>{{cite book|last=Guttman|first=D.

She also, with her pharmacy instructor, published a 10-page article in the prestigious [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] titled "Benzoylations in Ether Solution."<ref name="Chem Matters" />  Following her graduation, Ball was offered scholarships to attend the [[University of California Berkeley]] and the University of Hawaii.<ref name="Hawaii Times">{{cite news|last=Mendheim |first=Beverly|title=Lost and Found: Alice Augusta Ball, an Extraordinary Woman of Hawai'i Nei|url=http://www.northwesthawaiitimes.com/hnsept07.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013|newspaper=Northwest Hawaii Times|date=September 2007}}</ref> Ball decided to move back to Hawaii to pursue a master's degree in chemistry. In 1915, she became the first woman and first African American to graduate with a master's degree from the University of Hawaii.<ref name="Black Past">{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Miles|title=Ball, Alice Augusta|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/ball-alice-augusta-1892-1916|publisher=Black Past|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

==Research==
In her [[postgraduate]] research career at the University of Hawaii, Ball investigated the chemical makeup and [[active principle]] of ''[[Piper methysticum]]'' (kava) for her master's thesis.<ref name=Thesis>{{cite web|last=University of Hawaii at Manoa|title=Ball, Alice Augusta|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/1837|publisher=Scholar Space|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref> While working on her thesis, Ball was asked by Dr. Harry T. Hollmann, an assistant surgeon at [[Kalihi]] Hospital in Hawaii, to help him develop a method to isolate the active chemical compounds in [[chaulmoogra]] oil.<ref name="Hawaii Times" />  Chaulmoogra oil had previously been used in the treatment of Hansen's disease (leprosy) with mixed results.  Most patients with Hansen's disease were hesitant to take the oil over the long term because it tasted bitter and tended to cause an upset stomach.<ref name=Jackson />  Ball developed a process to isolate the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] [[esters]] of the [[fatty acid]]s in the chaulmoogra oil so that they could be injected, but died before she could publish her results.<ref name=Jackson />  Another chemist at the University of Hawaii, Arthur L. Dean, continued her work and began producing large quantities of the injectable chaulmoogra extract.<ref name="Chem Matters" /> In 1918, a Hawaii physician reported in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' that a total of 78 patients were released from Kalihi Hospital by the board of health examiners after treatment with injections.<ref name="Chem Matters" /><ref name=Thesis /> The isolated ethyl ester remained the preferred treatment for Hansen's disease until [[sulfone]] drugs were developed in the 1940s.<ref name="Chem Matters" />

==Death and legacy==
Alice Augusta Ball died on December 31, 1916, at the age of 24. She had become ill during her research and returned to Seattle for treatment a few months before her death.<ref name="Black Past" /> A 1917 newspaper article from the ''[[Pacific Commercial Advertiser]]'' suggested that the cause may have been [[chlorine]] poisoning that occurred while teaching.<ref name="Hawaii Times" /> However, the cause of her death is unknown as her original death certificate was altered, giving the cause of death as [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=Jackson />

Although her research career was short, Ball introduced a new treatment of Hansen's disease which continued to be used until the 1940s.<ref name="Chem Matters" />  The University of Hawaii did not recognize her work for nearly ninety years. In 2000, the university finally honored Ball by dedicating a plaque to her on the school's lone chaulmoogra tree behind Bachman Hall.<ref name="Hawaii Times" />  On the same day, the former [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], [[Mazie Hirono]], declared February 29 "Alice Ball Day" which is now celebrated every four years.<ref name="Women Chemists" /><ref name=Daily>{{cite news|last=Cederlind|first=Erika|title=A tribute to Alice Bell: a Scientist whose Work with Leprosy was Overshadowed by a White Successor|url=http://dailyuw.com/archive/2008/02/29/imported/tribute-alice-bell-scientist-whose-work-leprosy-was-overshadowed-white-s|accessdate=19 May 2013|newspaper=The Daily of the University of Washington|date=29 February 2008}}</ref> More recently, Ball was honored by the [[University of Hawaii]] Board of Regents with a Medal of Distinction in 2007.<ref name="Women Chemists" />
