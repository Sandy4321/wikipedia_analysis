The '''architecture of metropolitan [[Detroit, Michigan]]''' continues to attract the attention of architects and preservationists alike. With one of the world's most recognizable skylines, Detroit's waterfront panorama shows a variety of architectural styles.  The past meets the present as the city's historic [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers blend with the [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] neogothic [[spire]]s of the [[Comerica Tower]].  Together with the [[Renaissance Center]]'s gleaming towers, they form the city's marque. 
 
Detroit has an active community of professionals who are committed to the city's architectural legacy and future development.<ref>[http://www.cityscapedetroit.org/ Cityscape Detroit]</ref>  Detroit's architecture is recognized as being among the nation's finest with the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] listing many of [[Detroit]]'s skyscrapers and buildings as some of America's most endangered landmarks.<ref>[http://wsupress.wayne.edu/turtle/sharoffac/sharoffb.html Publisher review of ''American City: Detroit Architecture'']</ref> Detroit has one of the nation's largest surviving collections of late nineteenth and early twentieth century buildings. <ref>[[Robert Sharoff]] (2005).

[[Metro Detroit]] suburbs are among the most affluent in the nation with upscale malls, contemporary estates, and [[gilded age]] mansions.

Detroit was once called the ''Paris of the West'' for its architecture.  Founded in [[1701]], Detroit is the second oldest [[parish]] in the United States. Consequently, [[Metro Detroit]]'s many churches are among its architectural gems.  St. Anne's Church ([[1887]]) in Detroit is one of the most significant.   A partial list includes the Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament ([[1915]]), the Victorian Gothic style Fort Street Presbyterian Church ([[1855]]), Old St. Mary's Church ([[1885]]) in Greektown, the Cathedral Church of St. Paul ([[1911]]) by [[Ralph Adams Cram]], and Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian ([[1958]]) in Bloomfield Hills by [[Wirt C. Rowland]].  The Victorian Gothic style St. John's Episcopal Church ([[1861]]) sits across from the nation's first [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theater]] on Woodward Avenue.  Sculptor [[Corrado Parducci]]'s work adorns many of Detroit's churches including the ornate facade of St. Aloysius Church.  Among his Detroit projects, [[Gordon W. Lloyd]] designed the Christ P.E. Church ([[1863]]) at 960 E. Jefferson Avenue.  The Detroit Historical Society at the Detroit Historical Museum provides information on tours of the city's many historic churches. 

Following the fire of [[1805]], Fr. [[Gabriel Richard]] had said, ''"Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus,"'' meaning "We hope for better things; it will arise from the ashes" which became the city's offical motto.   For [[Detroit]],  Judge [[Augustus B. Woodward]] devised a plan similar to [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]'s design for [[Washington, DC]].  [[Detroit]]'s momumental avenues and traffic circles fan out  in a [[baroque]] styled radial fashion from [[Grand Circus Park]] in the heart of the [[Detroit Theatre District|city's theater district]].<ref>Vivian M. Baulch. [http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=205&category=locations  Woodward Avenue, Detroit's Grand old "Main Street"] Rearview Mirror, ''The Detroit News''</ref>  [[Compuware World Headquarters]] overlooks the reconstructed traffic cicle surrounding [[Campus Martius Park]] with the historic [[Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]] of the [[American Civil War]].  Once nearby, the old [[Detroit City Hall]] ([[1861]]) was demolished in 1961. 

Architects John and Arthur Scott designed the [[Wayne County Building]] ([[1897]]) in downtown Detroit which was the most extravagant building in Michigan at the turn of the century.  Apparently, expense was not a factor in construction of its lavish design.  Topped with bronze [[Quadriga|quadrigas]] by [[J. Massey Rhind]] and an [[Anthony Wayne]] [[pediment]] by [[Edward Wagner]], it may be America's finest example of Roman [[Baroque architecture]] with a blend of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]].

[[Image:Guardianinterior.jpg||right|thumb|200px|[[Guardian Building]]'s lavish interior]]
[[Albert Kahn]], often called the ''"architect of Detroit,"'' originally worked for John Scott. Kahn designed what is now [[Cadillac Place]] for [[General Motors]] which was the largest office building in the world when it opened in [[1923]].   In [[1927]], the seven [[Fisher Body|Fisher brothers]] who owned the automotive company [[Fisher Body]] essentially gave architect [[Albert Kahn]] a blank check to design and build the ''"most beautiful building in the world."'' <ref>Kay Houston and Linda Culpepper (2007).[http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=32&category=locations The beautiful building in the world] Rearview Mirror, ''The Detroit News''</ref> This became Detroit's famous [[Fisher Building]] which, with its detailed work and opulent lobby constructed with 40 different kinds of marble, has been called the city's ''"largest art object."'' <ref>Rebecca Mazzei (11-30-2005).[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=8550 Still Standing] ''Metro Times''
</ref>  The [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] are among the many [[National Historic Landmarks]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. 

Detroit's skyscrapers show less influence by the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school]] of architecture and are more eastern in character. Detroit's architectural legacy is rich in [[Art Deco]] style. Examples include [[Wirt C. Rowland]]'s [[Guardian Building]],  [[Albert Kahn]]'s [[Fisher Building]], and the [[David Stott Building]].  [[Comerica Tower]], with is neogothic [[spire]]s, is a fine example of [[Post-modern architecture|post modern architecture]] by leading architects [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]].

The Detroit area is home to light houses, yacht clubs, and many unique monuments. Examples include the [[Grosse Pointe Yacht Club]] and the Chauncey Hurlbut Memorial Gate at Waterworks Park<ref>[http://detroit1701.org/Hurlbut.htm Chauncey Hurlbut Memorial Gate] Detroit 1701.org</ref>.  Achitects such as [[Cass Gilbert]] who designed the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Washington, DC]] also designed the [[Detroit Public Library]] and [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]]'s exquisite James Scott Fountain.<ref>[http://detroit1701.org/JamesScott.htm James Scott Fountain] Detroit 1701.org</ref> [[Frederick Olmstead]], landscape architect of New York City's Central Park, designed Detroit's 982 acre [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] park.  [[Paul Cret]], architect of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington D.C. designed the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] building while [[Marshall Fredericks]]' sculptures, which include the [[Spirit of Detroit]], may be seen throughout the metopolitan area. Sculptor [[Corrado Parducci]]'s work can be found on many notable [[Metro Detroit]] buildings such as the [[Meadowbrook Hall]] mansion, the [[Guardian Building]], the [[Buhl Building]], the [[Penobscot Building]], the [[Fisher Building]] and the [[David Stott Building]].

The mansions of metropolitan Detroit are among the nation's grandest estates. [[Meadow Brook Hall]], the 110 room 88,000 ft<U+00B2> mansion of Matilda Dodge Wilson at 480 South Adams Rd. in the suburb of [[Rochester Hills, MI|Rochester Hills]], is the 4th largest in the United States.  The suburbs of [[Bloomfield Hills, MI|Bloomfield Hills]] and [[Grosse Pointe, MI|Grosse Pointe]] are replete with mansions.  [[Albert Kahn]] designed  [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]] House in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]] and the [[Edsel Ford|Edsel]] & Eleanor Ford House at 1100 Lakeshore Dr. in [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan|Grosse Pointe]].  Rose Terrace, the mansion of Anna Dodge,  once stood at 2 Lakeshore Dr. in [[Grosse Pointe, MI|Grosse Pointe]]. Designed by [[Horace Trumbauer]] as a [[Louis XV]] styled [[ch<U+00E2>teau]],  Rose Terrace was an enlarged version of the firm's Miramar in [[Newport, RI]].  A developer, the highest bidder for Rose Terrace, demolished it in 1976 to create an upscale neighborhood. This gave a renewed sense of urgency to preservationists. <ref> Patricia Zacharias. [http://info.detnews.com/history/story/index.cfm?id=97&category=locations Mrs. Dodge and the Regal Rose Terrace] Rearview Mirror, ''The Detroit News''</ref>    The Dodge Collection from Rose Terrace may be viewed at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].  The [[Russell A. Alger]] House, at 32 Lakeshore Dr., serves as the [[Grosse Pointe]] War Memorial.<ref>[http://www.warmemorial.org/ Grosse Pointe War Memorial, the Russell A. Alger Mansion] </ref> Noted architect [[Gordon W. Lloyd]] designed the Whitney House constructed of jasper stone. The Whitney House is now a fine restaurant at 4421 Woodward Avenue.  

Detroit's heritage includes many other famous architects. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] participated in the initial design for [[Henry Ford]]'s Fair Lane Estate in Dearborn.<ref>America's Castles: The Auto Baron Estates, ''A & E  Television Network'' (2000).
</ref>  Frank Lloyd Wright also designed the Turkel house at 2760 West Seven Mile Rd.<ref>Michael Jackman (06-26-2006).[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9372 Wright or wrong: Detroit's Turkel house drips with history]. ''Metro Times''</ref>, the Affleck House at 1925 N. Woodward Ave., and the Wall House in Plymouth. [[Minoru Yamasaki]] patterned his award winning design for the New York City's former [[World Trade Center]] towers after his design for Detroit's [[One Woodward Avenue]]. [[Eliel Saarinen]] was the architect for the [[Cranbrook Educational Community]] in the [[Metro Detroit]] suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]]. Eliel's son, the famed modernist [[Eero Saarinen]], designed a complex of buildings in the suburb of Warren, Michigan for General Motors known as the GM Technical Center. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] designed the buildings for Detroit's [[Lafayette Park]] neighborhood ([[1958]]-[[1965]]), including three high-rise apartment buildings and over 200 townhouses. A successful 78 acre urban renewal project, this development is the largest concentration of buildings designed by Mies van der Rohe in the world.

==Modern highlights==

===A city within a city===
An indicator of economic strength, the competitive office market in [[Metro Detroit]] is one of the nation's largest, with 147,082,003 ft<U+00B2> of space.<ref>[http://www.colliersmn.com/prod/ccgrd.nsf/publish/737C2B750A56E62D8525720C004ACE46/$File/Q3+06+Detroit+Office.pdf Collier's International Market Report - Detroit, Third Quarter, 2006]</ref> Two notable examples of [[Metro Detroit]]'s office architecture are the  5.5 million ft<U+00B2> [[Renaissance Center]] and the 2.2 million ft<U+00B2>  [[Southfield Town Center]].  Each complex is an interconnected group of skyscrapers termed a "city within a city" or a "pseudo-city". 

The construction of the [[Renaissance Center]] in downtown [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] marked a new era for the city's architecture. [[Detroit]]'s panoramic skyline would become architecturally renowned. And later, in the 2000's, the city's  waterfront would undergo a massive redevelopment. In the 1970s,  Detroit Renaissance, chaired by [[Henry Ford II]], commissioned  highly regarded architect [[John Portman]] to design an enormous skyscraper complex called the [[Renaissance Center]] in hopes of stemming the tide of [[white flight]] to the suburbs precipitated by court-ordered busing.  [[John Portman]] had hoped to halt the exodus. Portman expanded on his earlier design for the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] for the [[Renaissance Center]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]] beginning a new popular architectural era for the skyscraper hotel. (See Portman's [[Bonaventure Hotel]] in [[Los Angelos, California]]).  

Stemming the exodus from the city proved difficult for architectural planners with a growing suburban office market.  The [[Southfield Town Center]] became easy to recognize with its alluring marque of golden glass skyscapers.  Among professionals, it was seen as the place to be.  The 'city of gold' had attracted tenants in competition with the [[Renaissance Center]] as [[Metro Detroit]]'s office market continued its suburban sprawl.   

Years early, in [[1924]], Detroit's [[Book-Cadillac Hotel]] had opened as the world's tallest. (A re-developed Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel is set to open in [[2008]]).  In [[1977]], completion of the [[Renaissance Center]] restored the city's mantle. The [[Renaissance Center]]'s central tower opened with the world's tallest hotel skysraper, a flag ship 1298 room [[Westin]] hotel and conference center with the largest rooftop restaurant.   [[John Portman]]'s design was asthetically beautiful and secure.  However, [[Westin]]  moved its flagship [[Detroit]] hotel to the [[Southfield Town Center]] across from [[Lawrence Technological University]].  The central tower of the [[Renaissance Center]] became occupied by [[Marriott International]]'s largest hotel. 

In [[1996]], the [[Renaissance Center]]'s design would change when [[General Motors]] purchased the entire complex for its new headquarters.  The $500-million makeover of the complex included a $100-million renovation of the hotel.  A new front door Winter Garden provided waterfront access with spectacular views and expanded retail space. Construction of a lighted glass walkway (known as the "green ring") provided for ease of navigation circling the interior [[mezzanine]].  Concrete berms facing Jefferson Avenue were removed and replaced by a pedestrian friendly glass entry way facing Jefferson Avenue.   Since [[1986]], the central tower of the Renaissance Center has remained the tallest hotel skyscaper in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

The city, together with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, undertook another $500 million project along the Detroit International Riverfront to construct a three-mile riverfront promenade park along the east river from [[Hart Plaza]] and the [[Renaissance Center]] to the [[Belle Isle (Michigan)|Belle Isle]] bridge. Detroit Wayne County Port Authority added a state of the art cruise ship dock near the Renaissance Center on [[Hart Plaza]] in [[2005]]. A two-mile extension along the west river will take the riverfront promenade park from [[Hart Plaza]] to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of five miles of parkway from bridge to bridge. The city's waterfront has gained international notoriety. The state of Michigan constructed the first urban state park, the [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor.  Downtown Detroit has new stadiums and newly configured roads and freeways.

===Metro area===
[[Image:Somersetcollection-3.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Somerset Collection]] in the [[Metro Detroit]] suburb of Troy]]

A third leg in the [[Metro Detroit]] area is [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], headquarters to the [[Ford Motor Company]].  Dearborn's 14 story [[Hyatt Regency Dearborn| Hyatt Regency]] ([[1976]]) luxury hotel with its curved design by [[Charles Luckman]] is among the region's finest; it is one of the largest in the Hyatt chain with 772 rooms.  The suburb of  [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]] has many offices such as the [[Top of Troy]] along with the upscale [[Somerset Collection]] mall. [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] is the location of [[DaimlerChrysler]]'s American headquarters.  Detroit's historic skyscapers such as the [[Penobscot Building]] have state of the art technology in the heart of the city's wireless internet zone. Some of the newer multi-million dollar estates in the metro area include those of the Turtle Lake development in [[Bloomfield Hills, MI|Bloomfield Hills]].<ref>[http://www.turtlelakeliving.com/ Turtle Lake in Bloomfield Hills]</ref>

===Future development===

In downtown Detroit, there are $1.3 billion in new construction projects.<ref>[http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html The world is coming, see the change] Ciy of Detroit Partnership</ref>
Speculative development for Detroit includes a new downtown headquarters for [[Quicken Loans]] in order to consolidate its suburban offices. Planning for a major residential and retail development  adjacent to the [[Renaissance Center]] is in the works.  Many residential lofts and high rises are under construction in the [[Metro Detroit]] area. The Inn at Ferry Street is an example of a successful historic downtown resoration project. Other historic restoration projects in Detroit include housing in the Midtown area, the [[Fort Shelby Hotel]], and the [[Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel]].  The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) is studying the feasibility of a light rail or other rapid transit link from Arbor to Detroit.<ref>[http://www.annarbordetroitrapidtransitstudy.com/ Ann Arbor to Detroit Transit Study] ''SEMCOG''</ref> <ref>[http://www.semcog.org/TranPlan/AAtoDetroit.htm Ann Arbor to Detroit Rapid Transit Study Plan] ''SEMCOG''</ref>
