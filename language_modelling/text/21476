'''John Hummer''' (born May 4, 1948) is a [[venture capitalist]] and retired professional [[basketball]] player who was an original member of the [[Buffalo Braves]] after starring for the [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball]] team.  He also led his high school to the 1966 [[Virginia High School League|Virginia State]] 1A championship and helped Princeton earn a 1967-68 co-Ivy League Championship as well as a 1968-69 outright Ivy League Championship.  Over the course of his basketball career, he was coached by four [[National Basketball Hall of Fame]] members.

In college, Hummer was a three-time All-[[Ivy League]] selection (first-team: [[1968<U+2013>69 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team|1969]] & 1970, second team: 1968).<ref name=HBWLB/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&ATCLID=3749635|title=Men's Basketball Record Book <U+2022> Ivy League & National Awards |accessdate=2010-03-26|date=2009-06-12|author=Princeton Athletic Communications|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>  He played for two Ivy League champion teams and served as team [[captain (sports)|captain]] as a senior.<ref name=ATR/>  He was a part of the first of [[head coach]] [[Pete Carril]]'s thirteen Ivy League champions (1968), eleven [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] teams (1969) and three undefeated conference champions (1969). Although Hummer set no statistical records, his name continues to be ranked high in the Princeton record book by many statistical measures.

He played six seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) for the Braves, [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]].  He was the 15th overall selection in the [[1970 NBA Draft]] and the first [[NBA Draft|draft]] choice in the history of the Braves franchise.  As a Braves draft choice, he was a somewhat controversial pick in a draft year with two [[All-American]] local products available. During his NBA career, he played for Hall of Famers [[Dolph Schayes]], [[Bill Russell]] and [[Jack Ramsay]].

After his professional basketball career ended, he went to [[Stanford University]] to get an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] in 1980. In 1989, [[Ann Winblad]] and he founded Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, a venture capital firm focusing on [[software]] companies.

==Amateur career==
Hummer attended [[Washington-Lee High School]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].

During his career, he shared the spotlight with Petrie and did not set any statistical records at a school and conference where [[Bill Bradley]] continues to dominate the record books. Over the course of his career, Hummer was the 9th Tiger to accumulate 1000 career [[point (basketball)|point]]s (1031 in 67 games) and he continued to rank seventh in school history with a 15.4 points/game average through the 2009<U+2013>10 season.

==Professional basketball career==
Following his senior season, Hummer was one of three first-round Ivy League selections in the 1970 NBA Draft (Petrie <U+2013> 8th, McMillian 13th and Hummer 15th).<ref name=6970IMB/> Hummer was also drafted by [[The Floridians]] in the 1970 [[American Basketball Association]] draft.<ref>{{cite  web|url=http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=HUMMEJO01|title=John Hummer|accessdate=2010-03-26|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseBasketball.com}}</ref>  The 1970 draft included two promising [[All-American]] local-[[Buffalo <U+2013> Niagara Falls metropolitan area|Buffalo area]] talents: [[St. Bonaventure University]]'s Buffalo-born [[Bob Lanier (basketball)|Bob Lanier]] and [[Niagara University]]'s [[Calvin Murphy]].

After the Braves selected [[Ernie DiGregorio]] in the [[1973 NBA Draft]] to complement [[1972 NBA Draft]] selection [[Bob McAdoo]], it was clear the team was going to change to fast-paced offense to leverage DiGregorio's skills.  Hummer was more of a defensive player.  Prior to the [[1973<U+2013>74 NBA season]], Hummer was packaged with a [[1974 NBA Draft]] 2nd round pick and a [[1975 NBA Draft]] 2nd round pick in a trade that sent him to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in exchange for [[Gar Heard]] and [[Kevin Kunnert]].<ref name=JHBRdc/>  The deal was part of the resume that earned Donavan the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2009/news/05/03/executive/index.html|title=Denver's Mark Warkentien named NBA Executive of the Year|accessdate=2010-03-27|date=2009-05-03|publisher=[[NBA.com]]}}</ref> That season the 54<U+2013>28 [[Dick Motta]]-coached [[1973<U+2013>74 Chicago Bulls season|1973<U+2013>74 Bulls]] team that he was traded to initially would make the playoffs, but the 36<U+2013>46 [[Bill Russell]]-coached [[1973<U+2013>74 Seattle SuperSonics season|1973<U+2013>74 SuperSonics]] that he would finish the season with would not.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/1974.html|title=1973<U+2013>74 Seattle Supersonics Roster and Statistics|accessdate=2010-03-26|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CHI/1974.html|title=1973<U+2013>74 Chicago Bulls Roster and Statistics|accessdate=2010-03-26|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=Basketball-Reference.com}}</ref>

Never a strong free throw shooter, Hummer failed to make 50% of his free throws during his last three seasons in the NBA.  In the 1974-75 season, he shot an unusually low 0.275 from the free throw line.<ref name=nba1975/>

==Education and finance career==
