The '''Kentucky Derby''' is a [[graded stakes race|Grade I stakes race]] for three-year-old [[Thoroughbred|thoroughbred horse]]s, staged annually in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on the first Saturday in May, capping the two-week-long [[Kentucky Derby Festival]]. The race is over one and a quarter [[mile]]s (2 [[Kilometre|km]]) at [[Churchill Downs]]. [[Colt (horseracing)|Colts]] and [[gelding]]s carry 126 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (50.4 [[kilogram|kg]]) and [[Filly|fillies]] 121 pounds (48.4 kg).<ref>[http://www.drf.com/sample/pdf/sample_chart.pdf "Tenth Race Churchill May 1, 2004"]. May 1, 2004. Daily Racing Forum. Accessed on May 9, 2006.</ref> The race is known in the [[United States]] as "The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports" for its approximate duration, and is also called "The Run for the Roses" for the blanket of roses draped over the winner. It is the first leg of the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] in the US and typically draws around 155,000 fans. Norman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002.

==History==
[[Image:Kentucky quarter, reverse side, 2001.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A Kentucky Derby throughbred horse depicted on the Kentucky [[50 State Quarters|state quarter]]]]
[[Kentucky]] has been a major center of [[horse breeding]] and [[horse racing|racing]] since the late 1700s due to the [[Ordovician]] fields of the [[Bluegrass region]], which contains higher than average amounts of calcium and thus produced superior race horses. In 1872, Col. [[M. Lewis Clark|Meriwether Lewis Clark, Jr.]], grandson of [[William Clark]] of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark expedition]], traveled to [[England]], visiting the [[Epsom Derby]], a famous race that had been running annually since 1780. From there, Clark went on to [[Paris]], [[France]], where in 1863, a group of racing enthusiasts had formed the [[French Jockey Club]] and had organized the Grand Prix de Paris, which eventually became the famous [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].

Returning home to Kentucky, Clark organized the Louisville Jockey Club for the purpose of raising money to build quality racing facilities just outside of the city. The track would soon become known as [[Churchill Downs]], named for Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.'s relatives, John and Henry Churchill, who had provided the land for the racetrack. Officially, the racetrack was incorporated as Churchill Downs in 1937.

The Kentucky Derby was first run at 1.5 miles (2.4 km), the same distance as the Epsom Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris. In 1896, the distance was changed to its current 1.25 miles (2 km). On [[May 17]], [[1875]], in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people, a field of 15 three-year-old horses contested the first Derby. Under [[African American|African-American]] jockey [[Oliver Lewis]], a colt named [[Aristides (racehorse)|Aristides]], who was trained by future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]], [[Ansel Williamson]], won the inaugural Derby. Later that year, Lewis rode Aristides to a second-place finish in the [[Belmont Stakes]].

Although the first race meet proved a success, the track ran into financial difficulties and in 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with new capitalization and improved facilities. Despite this, the business floundered until 1902 when [[Matt Winn|Col. Matt Winn]] of Louisville put together a syndicate of businessmen to acquire the facility. Under Winn, Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby became the preeminent [[thoroughbred horse race]] in [[United States|America]].

Between 1875 and 1902, [[African American|African-American]] jockeys won 15 of the 28 runnings of the Kentucky Derby. On [[May 11]], [[1892]], African-American jockey [[Lonnie Clayton|Alonzo "Lonnie" Clayton]], age 15, became the youngest rider to win the Derby. The 1904 race was won by [[Elwood]], the first Derby starter and winner to be owned by a woman, Laska Durnell. In 1915, [[Regret (horse)|Regret]] became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby, and in 1917, the English bred colt "Omar Khayyam" became the first foreign-bred horse to win the race.

As part of gaining income, horse owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete a few weeks later in the [[Preakness Stakes]] at the [[Pimlico Race Course]], in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], followed by the [[Belmont Stakes]] in [[Elmont, New York]]. The three races offered the largest purse and in 1919 [[Sir Barton]] became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] didn't come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when [[Gallant Fox]] became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a "superhorse" that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the Derby. Two years after the term was coined, the race, which had been run in mid-May since inception, was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races.

In [[1950]], legendary baseball owner and promoter Joe Engel, who managed the [[Chattanooga Lookouts]] at [[Engel Stadium]], entered his horse, Hallieboy, who was known only as a laughing-stock underdog, that finished 10th of 14 horses in the race.

On [[May 3]], [[1952]], the first national television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place. In 1954, the purse exceeded [[United States dollar|$]]100,000 for the first time. In 1968, [[Dancer's Image]] became the first (and to this day the only) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of [[phenylbutazone]], an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug, were found in the horse's [[urinalysis]]; ironically, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on [[phenylbutazone]].    

The fastest time ever run in the Derby (at its present distance) is 1 minute 59 2/5 seconds, by [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] in 1973.

The 2004 Derby marked the first time that jockeys, as a result of a court order, were allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing.

In 2005, the [[purse distribution]] for the Derby was changed, so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse; previously only the first four finishers did so.

On [[February 1]], [[2006]], the Louisville-based fast-food company [[Yum! Brands, Inc.]] announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race "The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum! Brands" <ref>Hall, Greg. 2006. [http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060201/BUSINESS/60201011 "Louisville's Yum! Brands to sponsor Kentucky Derby."] The Louisville Courier-Journal.</ref>.

The 2006 edition of the race was won by [[Barbaro]], with jockey [[Edgar Prado]] aboard. The winning time was two minutes, 1.39 seconds. He won by 6.5 lengths over second place finisher [[Bluegrass Cat]]. [[Steppenwolfer]] finished third; [[Jazil]] and [[Brother Derek]] finished in a [[Tie (draw)|dead heat]] for fourth place.<ref>Scranton, Lyndal (2006).

==Traditions==
[[Image:MintJulep.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The [[Mint Julep]] is the traditional beverage of the Kentucky Derby.]]
In addition to the race itself, a number of traditions have played a large role in the Derby atmosphere. The [[Mint Julep]], an iced drink consisting of [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]], [[mint]] and a [[sugar]] syrup is the traditional beverage of the race. The historic drink is best served in an ice-frosted silver julep cup but most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from a souvenir glass printed with all previous Derby winners. Over 80,000 mint juleps are typically served on Derby Day and the preceding day's event, The [[Kentucky Oaks]] stakes race, which is considered by many to be "the Derby for Fillies." Also, [[burgoo]], a thick stew of beef, chicken, pork and vegetables, is a popular dish at the Derby. 

Legal [[gambling]] on the race is done through [[parimutuel betting]] at the track. The infield, a spectator area inside the track, offers low general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race. Instead, revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon. Sobriety is not a common state in the infield on Derby Day and on some occasions even being fully clothed has been optional. By contrast, "Millionaire's Row" refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich, the famous and the well-connected. Elegant women appear in fine outfits lavishly accessorized with large, elaborate hats. As the horses are paraded before the grandstands, [[Stephen Foster]]'s "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" is played by the [[University of Louisville]] [[marching band]] while the crowd stands and sings along. Native Kentuckians often surrender to tears as this traditional theme plays.

The Derby is frequently referred to as "''The Run for the Roses''," because a lush blanket of 554 red [[rose]]s is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. The tradition is as a result of [[New York]] socialite E. Berry Wall presenting roses to ladies at a post-Derby party in 1883 that was attended by Churchill Downs president, Col. M. Lewis Clark. This gesture is believed to have eventually led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race's official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner. The [[List of Governors of Kentucky|Governor of Kentucky]] (currently [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ernie Fletcher]]) awards the garland and the trophy. Pop vocalist [[Dan Fogelberg]] composed a song by that title for the 1980 running of the race.
