===1994-===
Dr Karl Kennedy previously ran the local medical practice in [[Erinsborough]]. Though a former [[general practitioner|GP]], Karl has been involved with various aspects of different medical situations, including mental health problems and births. He is married to Susan and they have broken up and reunited a number of times. Karl's first act of infidelity happened when he kissed [[Sarah Beaumont]] (his receptionist at the time).<ref name="Kennedy, Karl">{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?Alan:_Karl_Kennedy_to_stay_faithful&in_article_id=432235&in_page_id=7|title=Alan: Karl Kennedy to stay faithful|date=04.12.08|publisher=Metro|accessdate=10.11.09|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> After some time, Susan found out about this incident through their son, Billy. Her response was to slap Karl and throw him out. She eventually forgave him, but they separated after Susan developed [[retrograde amnesia]] and forgot everything that happened after 1972, including her marriage to Karl and the birth of their children. They eventually reconciled, but separated again and divorced after nearly 30 years of marriage. Karl then fell for [[Isabelle Hoyland]] ([[Natalie Bassingthwaighte]]). She fell pregnant by Gus Cleary (Ben Barrack) and led Karl to believe he was the father of her baby, but she suffered a [[miscarriage]]. The relationship between Karl and Izzy later ended.

Karl nearly died after having a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on a lonely road. Convinced any phone call he made would be his last, he called his ex-wife Susan, making him realise that he had made a mistake divorcing Susan although another reconciliation seemed unlikely at the time. Karl went on to make a full recovery.

After Susan's second husband [[Alex Kinski]] ([[Andrew Clarke (actor)|Andrew Clarke]]) died, Karl and Susan then attempted their relationship again but were forced to play it cool after [[Rachel Kinski|Rachel]] ([[Caitlin Stasey]]) and [[Zeke Kinski]] ([[Matthew Werkmeister]]), felt that she was betraying their late father. Karl became a mentor for Zeke, helping him with school work and football. Eventually Susan and Karl won Rachel and Zeke around and Karl moved back into the Kinski household, reuniting Susan and Karl in their marital home. While in England to see their son Malcolm, Karl proposed to Susan, who accepted, on the [[London Eye]]. Both were extremely surprised to discover that a heavily-pregnant Izzy was also in England and in a relationship with married footballer [[List of Neighbours characters (2007)#Pete Gartside|Pete Gartside]]. When Karl threw a surprise wedding a few days before they left for Ramsay Street, Izzy decided she was going to tell Karl that he was the father of her child. Both Pete and Izzy sneaked on board the boat Karl and Susan were getting married on, and she fell into labour after they were officially married. Karl helped deliver [[List of Neighbours characters (2007)#Holly Hoyland|Holly Hoyland]] at the ceremony, but he did not know she was his own child. Susan overheard Izzy and Pete talking in the ambulance that Karl was the father, but she kept this from him until they arrived back in Ramsay Street. Karl then returned to London to see his new daughter. When he returned from visiting Holly in London, Karl started working for Davo Mather, until he found out that the company Vivex was supplying dodgy drugs. He and his double-crossing PA went into the warehouse and tried to find the evidence. When he was ready to leave, she hid the swipe card and they were caught. She faked an injury so he could escape, returning to his office. When he got there, CEO Christian had the police remove his things, but his PA dobbed in Christian and Karl was set free.

When Susan was diagnosed with [[Multiple sclerosis|MS]],<ref name="Woodburne, Jackie">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/interviews/a138943/jackie-woodburne-susan-kennedy-neighbours.html|title=Neighbours Interview - Jackie Woodburne|last=Balls|first=David|date=09.01.09|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2009-11-10|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Karl had to get another job in order to cover the finances at home. He applied to work at the hospital again and became a hospital registrar. He became doctor to [[Rebecca Robinson (Neighbours)|Rebecca Napier]]'s ex [[Richard Aaronow]] who was dying of kidney failure. Karl wanted to tell his kids about it but he couldn't because of patient confidentiality. Paul Robinson eventually found out and told Rebecca. Karl became close to [[Nicola West]] ([[Imogen Bailey]]) while she was working as a nurse at the Hospital. His relationship with Nicola opened old wounds for a jealous Susan, but Karl was actually trying to cover up Nicola's unethical behaviour - she took a blood sample from criminal Pete Ferguson without permission. When interviewed during an investigation into the matter, Nicola blamed Karl, but Karl was ultimately found innocent.

When [[Harold Bishop]] and [[Lou Carpenter]] went for a routine checkup it was discovered that Harold had prostate cancer and needed urgent surgery.<ref name="Bishop, Harold">{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/78162-harold-bishop-discovers-cancer/|title=Harold Bishop discovers cancer|date=21.02.09|publisher=STV|accessdate=2009-11-11|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Word quickly spread and Karl ordered Harold to have the surgery. Harold then fled Erinsborough and Karl and the rest of the street begin to panic. Fortunately though Harold saw sense and returned to have his treatment. After returning from the brink of death, Harold left Ramsay Street to go travelling again <ref name="Smith, Ian">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8028314.stm|title=Harold bows out of Ramsay Street|date=01.05.09|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-11-10|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>

After Zeke went missing in a rafting accident and was presumed dead, Karl couldn't handle it and desperately believed that Zeke was alive. When he realised how much his family needed him, he finally accepted that Zeke was dead and wasn't coming back. Karl and Susan then received a call from Zeke who was living with a man named Phil Andrews. Zeke had suffered amnesia in the rafting accident, but the phone call triggered a memory he couldn't explain. Susan and Karl went to rescue their son where he decided to return to Ramsay Street.  Since then, Karl has worked with Zeke, re-building his trust and making him recognise that he does belong in Ramsay Street. When exchange student [[Sunny Lee]] arrived, she and Zeke began a relationship, much to Karl's disapproval. After a while it became apparent to Karl and everyone else that Zeke was not well and he was found to be suffering from [[anxiety disorder]]. Karl took Zeke back to the scene of the rafting accident to help him with his anxiety.

Karl spent his time writing his "Ask Dr Karl" newspaper column and co-presenting Lost Boy's radio show on PirateNet with Zeke. He co-presented the radio show with Zeke in an attempt to help Zeke with his anxiety disorder, however Zeke started to resent Karl's help.<ref name="Allen, Lily">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/spoilers/a185953/5772-lily-allen-drops-into-the-piratenet-studios.html|title=Lily Allen drops in to the PirateNet studios|last=Green|first=Kris|date=10.11.09|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=2009-11-11|location=United Kingdom}}</ref> Karl was sacked by PirateNet for breaching their station charter, however, knowing how much the radio show means to Karl, Zeke started an on-air campaign to bring him back.<ref name="Kennedy, Karl, PirateNet">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/neighbours/coming-next/karls-hired-then-fired-by-piratenet/6387|title=Karl is hired then fired by PirateNet|date=11.11.09|publisher=What's on TV|accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> After [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] took over Pirate Net, he allowed Karl to come back for his regular radio show. 

When Karl suffers a health scare he is taken to the hospital, where he meets a seemingly arrogant, [[List of Neighbours characters (2010)#Doug Harris|Doctor Doug Harris]]. After having to wait a long time to be seen and for test results, Karl decides to expose the hospital board in a newspaper article. He then asks Doctor Harris for his job back and Doctor Harris agrees. Karl clashes with Doctor Harris on a few occasions and is shocked to find Libby is dating him. During a [[Million Paws Walk]], organised by [[Rebecca Robinson (Neighbours)|Rebecca Robinson]], Karl decides to walk Dahl, the [[Galah]], to compete against Rebecca and Cat. Dahl goes missing and Karl blames Cat, he shouts at Rebecca and she leaves upset. Karl then launches a search for Dahl. Karl and Susan both support Libby when she discovers that Steph is carrying [[Daniel Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Daniel Fitzgerald]]'s baby. Karl helps Susan out with a report on Lou's new used car lot and he spots a Galah near by. Karl decides that he will help Lou bond with the bird, but he discovers that it is Dahl. Lou refuses to give up the bird as he wants to use her in his new advertisements. They begin a competition with each other to see who can attract the bird. Dahl flies in to Toadie's house and Toadie brings her back to Karl. [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]) asks Karl to be his best man at his wedding to [[Donna Freedman]] ([[Margot Robbie]]). Karl forgets his wedding anniversary and tries to get Zeke and Ringo to help him out. He eventually writes Susan a song and performs it to her in Harold's Store. Karl is devastated when Ringo is accidentally killed by [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) and he leads a tribute to him at the Blokes Club shed. Karl is not happy when Libby decides to lie in her statement. When he discovers that Lyn is running a blood drive in Ringo's memory, he reacts angrily. He tells Lyn that he thinks Steph should go to jail for killing Ringo. He and Susan fight and Karl later agrees to make an victim impact statement for [[Samantha Fitzgerald]] ([[Simone Buchanan]]).

But the important thing is it works, and watching the writers break them up and put them back together several times has made for great telly.
