{{for|the former personal attorney of Anna Nicole Smith|Howard K. Stern}} 

'''Howard Allan Stern''' (born [[January 12]], [[1954]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[radio programming|radio]] and [[Television|TV]] personality, [[media proprietor|media mogul]], [[humorist]], [[actor]], and [[author]]. Stern hosts ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' four days a week (Monday-Thursday) on [[Howard 100]], a [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] station.

The self-proclaimed "King of All Media" (a humorous reference to [[Michael Jackson]]'s appellation "The King of Pop") has been dubbed a [[shock jock]] for his highly [[controversy|controversial]] use of [[scatology|scatological]], [[sexual]] and [[racial]] humor. Stern has said that the show was never about shocking people, but primarily intended to offer his honest opinions on a gamut of issues (ranging from world affairs to problems among his own staff). Though controversial, he is one of the highest-paid radio personalities in the [[United States]] and the most fined personality in radio broadcast history.

He is best known for his national radio show, which for many years was [[radio syndication|syndicated]] on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio stations]] (and a few [[AM broadcasting|AM]] stations) throughout the [[United States]] until his last [[terrestrial radio]] broadcast on [[December 16]], [[2005]]. He began broadcasting on the subscription-based [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] [[satellite radio]] service on [[January 9]], [[2006]].

In addition to radio, Stern moved into [[publishing]], television, [[feature film]]s, and music.  He has written two books, ''[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]'', which he adapted into a [[Private Parts (1997 film)|film]], and ''Miss America''.  Stern's television endeavors include a variety show on [[New York City]]'s [[WWOR-TV]], a nightly [[E!]] show documenting his radio broadcasts, a similar [[CBS]] program that competed with [[Saturday Night Live]] for a time, "Howard On-Demand" for [[digital cable]] subscribers in various markets, and ''[[Son of the Beach]]'', a [[parody]] of [[Baywatch]] for [[FX Networks|FX]] which Stern [[executive producer|executive produced]].

In [[2006]], Howard Stern was elected into [[Time Magazine]]'s "Time 100: The People who shape our world"<ref>{{cite news

==Personal life==
Howard Stern was born into a [[American Jews|Jewish American]] family living in the [[Long Island]] town of [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 63|chapter= Black and Blue Like Me|chapterurl= |quote= I grew up the only white man in a black neighborhood in Roosevelt, Long Island, a pawn in my mother's little social experiment in integration.}}</ref>.

Although both his parents are Jewish, Stern has long claimed on his show to be a "half-Jew"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} (the other half being [[Italy|Italian]]). This claim is apparently a running gag, as Stern sometimes mutters [[Yiddish]] phrases on the air which he claims to be [[Italian language|Italian]] phrases. Stern's Hebrew name is Tzvi; his paternal grandparents, Froim and Anna (Gallar) Stern and maternal grandparents, Sol and Esther (Reich) Schiffman,<ref>http://www.wargs.com/other/stern.html</ref> were [[Austro-Hungarian]] Jews who immigrated to America at about the same time.

Stern often said that his parents verbally "[[abuse]]d"{{Fact|date=June 2007}} him as a child, which was corroborated during a 1990 broadcast when he played old family recordings, many of which have become oft-played [[soundbites]], including remarks such as "I told you not to be stupid, you [[moron]]"<ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 43|chapter= It Was the Worst of Times, It Was the Worst of Times|chapterurl= |quote= I TOLD YOU NOT TO BE STUPID, YOU MORON!}}</ref> and "Shut up! Sit down!" being screamed at a 7-year-old Howard<ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 43|chapter= It Was the Worst of Times, It Was the Worst of Times|chapterurl= |quote= At seven years of age, you'd think he'd cut me some slack. But no, it was "SHUT UP! SITE DOWN!"}}</ref>. These old recordings were later used in a parody commercial for the "The Ben Stern Day-Care Center", which specialized in producing overachieving, self-hating [[megalomania]]cs <ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 43|chapter= It Was the Worst of Times, It Was the Worst of Times|chapterurl= |quote= If you want to turn your child into an overachieving, self-hating megalomaniac who spends his days hiding from his family and his nights masturbating, then the Ben Stern Day-Care Center will work for you....}}</ref>. Stern said his mother ran her house with "the intensity of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]"<ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 36|chapter= It Was the Worst of Times, It Was the Worst of Times|chapterurl= |quote= I'm an obsessive-compulsive, anal-retentive, miserable neurotic because I was raised by a woman who ran her household with the intensity of Hitler.}}</ref> and that his father's "favorite sport was yelling."<ref>{{cite book |last= Stern|first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Stern |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]] |origdate=1993-10-15 |edition= 1st edition|publisher= [[Simon & Schuster]]|location= |isbn=978-0671880163 |oclc= 28968496|doi= |id= |pages= 41|chapter= It Was the Worst of Times, It Was the Worst of Times|chapterurl= |quote= My father's favorite sport was yelling.}}</ref> However, he has also said that such exaggerated claims were part of his [[shtick]] and that his parents were actually warm, loving and supportive{{Fact|date=June 2007}}.

Stern attended [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School|Roosevelt Junior High School]], where he was supposedly one of the few [[white people|white]] students in a predominantly [[African American]] school.  During a 1992 special, Howard Stern's former [[Physical education|gym teacher]] ('Mr. Chestnut') mentioned that the school's student body was 60% black, indicating Stern's claims to be an exaggeration. When Stern's family moved in 1969, he transferred to [[South Side High School (Rockville Centre, New York)|South Side High School]], where he graduated in [[1972]].<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/features/custom/ithappened/longisland/ny-iholi0217story,0,1149101.htmlstory?coll=ny-rightrail-bottompromo It Happened In Long Island] Newsday</ref> In 1976, he received a [[bachelor's degree]] in communications from [[Boston University]], carrying a 3.8 [[GPA]] and also working (before being fired) as a volunteer at the campus radio station [[WTBU]]. Stern now funds a [[scholarship]]<ref>[http://www.bu.edu/bulletins/com/item19.html Office of Financial Aid] Boston University</ref> at Boston University.

On [[June 4]], [[1978]], Stern married college sweetheart Alison Berns at Temple Ohabei Shalom in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. They have three daughters: Emily Beth (b. 1983), Deborah Jennifer (b. 1986) and Ashley Jade (b. 1993).<ref>[http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&c=FlexContent&cid=1134268004584 Howard Stern Biography] on Sirius.com</ref> A hallmark of Stern's humor was his claiming to be tempted by the [[strippers]], [[porn stars]] and [[lesbian]]s appearing on his show, but always insisted that he had to be faithful to his wife.  In [[October 1999]], Stern announced that he and wife Alison decided to separate. They amicably [[divorce]]d in 2001, ending in a settlement. 

Stern began a period of single living in Manhattan, and dated dozens of women including [[Angie Everhart]] and [[Robin Givens]]. Despite reportedly spending time with [[Carmen Electra]] "five times" (as revealed on the [[July 29]], [[2002]] broadcast), the two have denied there was anything more intimate than an outdoor shower in bathing suits. 

Since early [[2000]], Stern has dated model [[Beth Ostrosky]], who is 18 years his junior. Ostrosky frequently appears in the men's magazine [[FHM]], and co-hosts ''[[Casino Cinema]]'' on [[Spike TV]]. The pair live together with their [[English Bulldog]] named Bianca Romijn-Stamos-O'Connell.  On [[February 14]], 2007, Stern announced that he and Ostrosky became engaged the day before.<ref name=engage /><ref>http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20011860,00.html</ref>

On his May 24, 2007, radio show, Stern and [[Artie Lange]] became embroiled in a long discussion touching on subjects such as their friendship and Lange's personal problems. Stern revealed that everyone had "shit in their life" and because of his own problems in the past, he had contemplated suicide, going so far as to have placed a gun in his mouth twice in his life.

He lives on New York City's [[Upper West Side]] and has a weekend house on Long Island.

==Terrestrial radio career ==
After graduating from Boston University, he worked as a [[disc jockey]] and [[program director]] for [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], playing [[rock music]]. He discovered a talent for [[Lenny Bruce]]-type comedy, and developed a wide-ranging confrontational style. In [[1978]], Stern landed his first morning show job in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] at [[WCCC-FM]] and WCCC-AM, whose [[progressive rock]] format promoted Howard's development as a "free form" personality. Radio station owner, Sy Dresner, thought Stern's use of phone calls (as radio personality [[Don Imus]] was doing then) was a natural ratings appeal.  It was at the Hartford radio station that Howard met his future show writer and producer, [[Fred Norris]], who was working as an overnight [[disc jockey|deejay]] at the time.

Stern moved to FM radio station [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]] "W4" in [[Detroit, Michigan]], further developing his show until the station adopted a [[country music]] format, and then went to [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC-FM]] "DC101," in [[Washington, D.C.]] for a year, making it the #1 station in town. In [[1982]], he returned to New York City to work at [[NBC]]'s flagship AM radio station, [[WNBC Radio]]. Also working at NBC at that time was [[David Letterman]], who became a fan of Stern's radio show. Stern's guest appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on [[June 19]], [[1984]], launched Stern into the national spotlight and gave his radio show unprecedented exposure. Stern would appear on Letterman's show many times thereafter.

Stern and his crew were fired from NBC in [[1985]], ostensibly in response to a particularly outrageous sketch <U+2014> "[[Bestiality]] Dial-A-Date" <U+2014> although relations between station management and Stern had been strained from the beginning (as well documented in his book [[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]). He quickly returned to FM radio by joining local rival station [[WFNY-FM|WXRK]], premiering [[November 18]], [[1985]], moving permanently to the [[morning drive]] time slot in [[February 1986]]. By year's end, his show was simulcast on [[WYSP]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Before long it was also heard in Washington, D.C., and was then [[radio syndication|syndicated]] nationwide by [[Infinity Broadcasting]]. The program made great sport out of feuding with other cities' top-rated [[DJ|deejay]]s, and soon Stern's broadcast was number one in several major markets, including Philadelphia and [[Los Angeles]]. His [[Arbitron]] numbers were strongest in the country's number one radio market, New York City, where his morning ratings more than tripled his station's average numbers the rest of the day.

==Satellite radio career==
{{main|The Howard Stern Show}}
On [[October 6]], [[2004]], Stern announced on his show that he had signed a five year contract with Sirius, a satellite radio service.  Sirius provided a budget of $500 million to pay Howard, his staff and general production costs.<ref>[http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRa.13ej.htm Sirius Satellite Radio Inc <U+00B7> 8-K <U+00B7> For 10/1/04]</ref> His personal salary has not been revealed. Other media sources have claimed that Stern netted a $225 million one-time stock bonus for meeting subscriber quotas, which he did meet in [[January 2006]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/05/news/newsmakers/stern/index.htm | title=Howard Stern & Co. score $200M payout | work=CNNMoney.com | date=[[2006-01-05]] | accessdate=2006-07-26}}</ref> 

Stern stated that he was growing increasingly unhappy doing his show on terrestrial radio. The combined stresses of heavy censorship and editing by management as well as lengthy commercial breaks weighed into his decision to start anew on Sirius. Stern admitted to feeling "dead inside creatively" in December, 2005 while still on terrestrial radio.<ref name="decwapo">{{cite news

}}</ref>.

The Sirius deal, which took effect on [[January 1]], [[2006]], enabled Stern to broadcast his show without the [[censorship|content restrictions]] imposed by the [[FCC]]. Moreover, the deal also enabled Stern to program an additional Sirius channel.

On [[February 28]], [[2006]], [[CBS Radio]] announced it had filed a [[lawsuit]] against Stern, Stern's agent [[Don Buchwald]], and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], saying Stern used CBS's [[radio waves|airwaves]] to unfairly promote the satellite service and enrich himself. The lawsuit also claims that Stern "repeatedly and willfully" breached his contract with CBS, "misappropriated millions of dollars worth of <U+2026> airtime" for his own benefit, and "fraudulently concealed" his performance-related interests in Sirius stock. The suit, filed in New York state court, sought [[compensatory damages|compensatory]] and [[punitive damages]]. Not to be outdone, Stern earlier in the day (prior to CBS's announcement) held a [[press conference]] at which he mentioned that CBS added to the media attention, booking him for appearances on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and its [[news magazine]] show ''[[60 Minutes]]''. "I made them millions of dollars. If I was hurting them, why did they keep me on the air for 14 months?" Stern said. "How can you have it both ways?"<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2006/03/01/stern-lawsuit-cbs.html CBS Radio files lawsuit against Stern, Sirius] CBC March 1, 2006</ref> 

[[Leslie Moonves]] appeared on one of Stern's final shows to compliment him on his move to Sirius and thank him for the record [[advertising]] revenue the [[radio network|network]] sold. Moonves told Stern that he bought Sirius stock.  Stern said the network had the option to "push the button" on his program, taking him off the air, if they did not agree with what he was presenting to the public. 

On [[May 11]], [[2006]], CBS said it was near settling the lawsuit with Stern. "We have an agreement, but there are details that have to be worked out," said CBS lawyer Irvin Nathan.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyid=2006-05-11T231122Z_01_N11342746_RTRUKOC_0_US-MEDIA-CBS-STERN.xml&src=rss&rpc=22 Stern nears settlement with CBS] Reutuers</ref> Some details of the agreement were officially announced [[May 26]].<ref>http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=222720</ref>

As a result of the CBS lawsuit settlement, Stern announced on [[June 7]], [[2006]] that Sirius gained exclusive rights to his entire back catalog of radio shows from his days at CBS (about 23,000 hours). The shows cost Sirius approximately $2 million, which equates to approximately $87 per hour of tape. Sirius has the rights to the tapes until the end of Stern's current contract with Sirius, and then all ownership rights will return to Stern.<ref>{{cite news | title=Stern Gets Old Tapes, CBS Gets $2M | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/25/entertainment/main1654391.shtml?source=RSS&attr=Business_1654391 | publisher=CBS News | date=May 25, 2006| accessdate=July 26, 2006}}</ref>

==Career in other media==
In [[1993]], Stern released his [[autobiography]], ''[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]''. The book was a [[bestseller]] and became the fastest selling book in [[Simon & Schuster]]'s history.<ref>{{cite news 
 | title = STERN'S 'PRIVATE PARTS' TOPS LIMBAUGH'S MARK

In [[1994]], Stern embarked on a political campaign for [[Governor of New York]], formally announcing his candidacy under the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket.<ref>{{cite news 
  | title = The Stern gang. (Howard Stern becomes Libertarian Party candidate for New York State governor)
  | publisher = The New Yorker
  | date =  May 9, 1994
  | pages=39}}</ref> Although he legally qualified for the office and campaigned for a time after his nomination, many considered his gubernatorial run a [[publicity stunt]]. His platform included restoring the [[death penalty]], limiting road construction work to nighttime hours, and abolishing tolls. After he accomplished his platform's goals he planned on resigning the post. However, he subsequently withdrew his candidacy because he did not wish to comply with the financial disclosure requirements for candidates. 

In [[1996]], Stern released his second book, ''Miss America'', which focused more on his radio career. Like his first book, it was also a [[bestseller]].
[[Image:Howardstern book1.jpg|left|100px|thumb|border|''Private Parts'' [[paperback]] cover]]

In [[1997]], he starred in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]'', a biographical film chronicling his rise to success. The film is based on his 1993 autobiography ''Private Parts''. The film premiered at the top of the [[box office]] in its opening weekend with a gross of $14.6 million. It grossed slightly more than $41 million in total.<ref>http://www.boxofficereport.com/byfilm/1997/privateparts.shtml</ref>

The movie received mostly positive reviews from critics, including [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]], who were frequent guests of Stern's radio show. Some critics claimed the film glossed over his use of sexual and racial humor.<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1075777-private_parts/</ref>

For his performance, Stern won the [[Blockbuster Entertainment Award]] for Favorite Male Newcomer. The awards are given based on [[write-in]] votes from fans, and Stern won by a wide margin. Stern was nominated for a [[Satellite Awards|Golden Satellite Award]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy). He was also nominated for a [[Razzie Award]] for Worst New Star.

In [[2002]], Stern's production company '''Howard Stern Productions''' acquired the rights to the 1982 movie ''[[Porky's]]'' and the 1979 movie ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]''. Stern was also a producer of the TV series ''[[Son of the Beach]]'', which ran for three seasons.

He informed listeners early in 2004 that the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network was in talks with him to produce an interview special.

==Other career notes==
Stern has had his share of stalkers and death threats. On [[January 15]], [[1998]], Lance Carvin was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for [[stalking]] and threatening to kill Stern and his family.  <ref>{{cite news 
  | title = STERN SENTENCE FOR STALKER.

  |quote=Michael Lance Carvin, 44, sent four letters to Stern last spring from Las Vegas, one of which said, "I will absolutely, without a doubt, kill you and this is 100 percent guaranteed." The sentence was nearly twice as much as federal sentencing guidelines called for.
