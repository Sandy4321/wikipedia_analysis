'''Thomas William Humes''' (April 22, 1815 &ndash; January 16, 1892) was an American clergyman and educator, active in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], during the latter half of the 19th century.  Elected rector of [[St. John's Cathedral (Knoxville, Tennessee)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in 1846, Humes led the church until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when he was forced to resign due to his [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] sentiments.  He was named president of East Tennessee University in 1865, and during his tenure, he led the school's expansion and transition into the [[University of Tennessee]].  Humes later served as the first librarian of the [[Lawson McGhee Public Library|Lawson McGhee Library]], and published a book about East Tennessee's Unionists entitled, ''The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee''.<ref name=rothrock>East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), ''The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 244, 293-295, 309, 315, 431-432.</ref> 

==Biography==
===Early life===
Humes was born in Knoxville in 1815, the son of Thomas Humes (1767&ndash;1816) and Margaret Russell Cowan Humes (1777&ndash;1854), both of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] descent.<ref name=rothrock />  Humes's father, a native of [[Armagh]], [[Ireland]],<ref name=rothrock /> began building the [[Bijou Theatre (Knoxville)|Lamar House Hotel]] in 1816, but died later that same year.  Humes's mother oversaw the hotel's completion, however, and under her direction, it grew to become Knoxville's premier hotel.<ref>Dean Novelli, "On a Corner of Gay Street: A History of the Lamar House<U+2014>Bijou Theater, Knoxville, Tennessee, 1817<U+2013>1985." East Tennessee Historical Society ''Publications'', Vol. 56 (1984), pp. 3-45.</ref>  The younger Humes was a half-brother of James Cowan (1801&ndash;1871), a cofounder of the wholesaling firm, [[Fidelity Building (Knoxville)|Cowan, McClung and Company]], and a stepbrother of historian [[J. G. M. Ramsey]] (1797&ndash;1884). 

Humes graduated from East Tennessee College (the forerunner of the University of Tennessee) in 1831, and obtained his Master's degree from the school two years later.<ref name=rothrock />  He then entered the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] with the intention of becoming a [[Presbyterian]] minister, but left after deciding he could not take the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].<ref name=rothrock />  After returning to Knoxville, Humes briefly worked for his half-brother's business before embarking on a career in journalism.  During the late 1830s and early 1840s, he worked variously as editor of the ''Knoxville Times'', the ''Knoxville Register'', and a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] paper, ''The Watch Tower''.<ref name=rothrock />

===St. John's Episcopal Church===
In the mid-1840s, Humes began studying under the authority of Tennessee's Episcopal Bishop [[James Otey]] (1800&ndash;1863).  He initially served as Sunday [[lay reader]] for Knoxville's St. John's Episcopal Church congregation, and after being ordained a deacon in March 1845, he served as assistant to the church's rector.  In July 1845, Humes was ordained a priest by Bishop Otey, and in September 1846, the congregation elected him rector.<ref name=rothrock />

Although he was a slave owner, Humes helped several slaves in Knoxville purchase their freedom during the late 1840s and 1850s.<ref name=mckenzie>Robert McKenzie, ''Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), pp. 141-143.</ref><ref name=rothrock />  He also opened a school for Knoxville's free blacks and freed slaves.<ref name=rothrock />  During the secession crisis of 1860 and 1861, Humes remained fervently loyal to the Union, even though many of his relatives and most of his congregation supported secession.  After he refused to acknowledge Confederate president [[Jefferson Davis]]'s National Day of Prayer in mid-1861, he was finally forced to resign.<ref name=mckenzie />

===Civil War===

After Tennessee seceded in June 1861, Humes wanted to move to the North, but a broken leg prevented him from doing so.<ref name=mckenzie />  Humes dubbed the Confederate occupation of Knoxville a "reign of terror,"<ref name=mckenzie /> but remained in the city throughout the war, protected in part by his blood and marriage ties to many of the city's Confederate leaders.   In June 1863, Humes prayed with dying Confederate Preston McClung, who had been mortally wounded in an attempted raid on the city by General [[William P. Sanders]].<ref name=mckenzie />  

When General [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s Union forces occupied Knoxville in September 1863, the general asked Humes to resume his position as rector of St. John's Episcopal Church, which Humes accepted.  Confederate diarist Ellen Renshaw House, a member of the St. John's congregation, boycotted Humes's opening sermon, calling Humes "the grandest old rascal that ever was."<ref name=mckenzie />  In November 1863, Humes performed a funerary sermon for General Sanders, who had been mortally wounded by advancing Confederate forces in West Knoxville.<ref>Digby Gordon Seymour, ''Divided Loyalties: Fort Sanders and the Civil War in East Tennessee'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 1963), pp. 148-149.</ref>

===University of Tennessee===
Humes was named president of East Tennessee University in 1865, and almost immediately managed to secure an $18,500 federal grant to help restore the school's deteriorated campus, which had been occupied by both Union and Confederate armies during the war.<ref name=rothrock /><ref name=tehc>Milton Klein, [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=U016 University of Tennessee].  ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'', 2002.  Retrieved: 2 November 2010.</ref>  In 1869, Tennessee's state government designated the school the recipient of the state's [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] funds.  This amounted to $400,000, which generated for the school $24,000 in annual interest.<ref name=tehc />  As required by the Morrill Act, the school established colleges of agriculture, engineering, and military science.  

East Tennessee University changed its name to the University of Tennessee in 1879 in hopes of obtaining more state funding.<ref name=tehc />  Humes resigned as president in 1883, and was succeeded by Charles Dabney.

===Later life===
In 1886, Humes was named the first librarian of the Lawson McGhee Library, which had been established the previous year.<ref name=rothrock />  Two years later, he published ''The Loyal Mountaineers of Tennessee'', which documented the actions of East Tennessee's Unionists during the Civil War, and analyzed the reasons behind the region's strong pro-Union sentiments.  Humes died in 1892, and was buried in Knoxville's [[Old Gray Cemetery]].     

Throughout his later years, Humes used his influence to raise money for educational and economic development in East Tennessee.  In 1864, he was elected chairman of the East Tennessee Relief Association, which raised money to help East Tennessee Unionists impoverished by the Civil War.<ref name=rothrock />  During the late 1860s, he helped Knoxville obtain Peabody funding, which the city used to establish a public school system.  In 1873, Humes cofounded the St. John's Orphanage, which operated in Knoxville into the 20th century.<ref name=rothrock />
