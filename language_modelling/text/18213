'''Church of St Michael and All Angels''' is a parish church located on Riverside in [[Felton, Northumberland|Felton]], [[Northumberland]], England. Built circa 1200, its many alterations and additions have caused it to be almost encased within another church. Some unusual features are that the [[nave]] and an aisle appear roofless, as well as a window with geometrical [[tracery]] that features an [[rose window|eight petalled flower]] patterned central circle cut from a single stone.   Dedicated to [[Saint Michael]], it is a [[Grade I listed buildings in Northumberland|Grade I listed building]].

==Geography==

In 1759, Thomas Heron of [[East Thirston]] provided a sum of money to build a [[balcony|gallery]], probably followed by the erection of the north aisle with sash windows.<ref name="Committee1904">{{cite book|author=Northumberland County History Committee|title=A history of Northumberland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3mogAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA271|accessdate=25 October 2011|edition=Public domain|year=1904|publisher=A.

==Architecture==
The earliest work is in the [[chancel]] and [[nave]], the latter having originally been without aisles. Together, they formed a low narrow building, measuring from east to west about {{convert|104|ft}}, and about {{convert|20|ft}} in width. The semi-round respond at the east end of the north nave arcade is similar to the [[Door jamb|jamb]]s of the chancel arch, and possibly indicates the presence of a small transept or chapel.<ref name="Committee1904" /> There was a bell [[turret]] at the west end of the nave, and a porch on the south side. The 14th century builders nearly doubled the size of the fabric. They took down the north and south walls of the nave, and erected two [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s in their place; that on the north consisting of five arches, and that on the south of three; because the porch was not demolished, but allowed to stand, which piece of conservatism entailed a different proportion of the space. They rebuilt the bell turret on the older [[buttress]]es, and they built a new porch. The chancel arch is of two chamfered orders, with a chamfered hood-moulding towards the nave, and is carried on semi-round responds having moulded bases on square and chamfered plinths, and capitals, with square hollow chamfered abaci.<ref name="Committee1904" /> It is strengthened with a buttress at the south-east angle. Between the 14th century and the renovation of circa 1845 there were other changes.  Around 1845, the easternmost half of the north aisle was taken down and widened three-fold to its former dimensions. A small [[vestry]] was added in the late 1860s when a gallery at the west end was removed; the church was newly seated, and new windows were inserted.<ref name="Wilson1870" /> Some of the roof areas are quite low so that the appear to be roofless; examples include over the nave and an aisle.<ref name="PevsnerGrundy1992" />

;Doors
The details of the south doorway are similar to those of the chancel arch, but they have been much interfered with, only the outer order of the arch and the capitals being ancient. On the south side of the chancel, the low arched priests' door was built up, and a square cottage door of higher height inserted westwards of it. Probably a priest's door once existed where the modern chancel door now is, as there is no evidence of a window at this point.<ref name="Committee1904" />

;Windows
The three windows on the south side of the chancel are lancets with widely splayed jambs on the interior, contracted bv shoulders at the springing of the arch, which give to the latter a trefoil form. In the eastern wall of the south aisle, there is a beautiful example of the work of the period. A five-light window features geometrical [[tracery]] with a [[rose window|eight petalled flower]] patterned central circle, remarkably cut from a single stone.<ref name="PevsnerGrundy1992">{{cite book|last1=Pevsner|first1=Nikolaus|last2=Grundy|first2=John|last3=McCombie|first3=Grace|coauthors=Peter Ryder, Humphrey Welfare|title=Northumberland|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kClO7NOfvsIC&pg=PA279|accessdate=25 October 2011|date=11 March 1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09638-5|pages=279<U+2013>}}</ref> This window was probably inserted in 1331, at the instance of Roger Mauduit who was granted a licence to endow a chantry in the church.<ref name="Committee1904" /> The small [[Early English Period]] east light, or triplet, was removed during a renovation to make room for a gaping round-headed sash window of small square panes.<ref name="Wilson1870" />

;Porch
A porch to the south door seems to have been the first addition to the church, the outline of which can be easilv traced, and it reached to the present aisle wall.The 14th century builders, who added aisles to the structure did not take down the 13th century porch they found on the south side, but enclosed it in their addition. From it they built out a second porch, which now gives access to the first.<ref name="Wilson1870" /> The roof line of the original porch may be seen over the early door on the inside of the present south door, and is supported by a chamfered arch rib. The outer door to the first porch, now the inner one of the existing porch, is of two chamfered orders that continue to the ground, with a hood-moulding springing from carved terminals. Several courses remain of the diagonal buttresses which originally flanked this door.<ref name="Committee1904" />

==Fittings==
The church has two old bells.<ref name="Chronicle1890" /> One is a pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], having the inscription "Ave . M | Ria . Gracia . Plena" and another was probably made in 1764. The side benches are of stone. The bowl and shaft of the font are octagonal; it has been rechiselled and appears to be of the 14th century. In the north wall is a portion of the effigy of a priest holding a chalice; it rests within an arched recess springing from moulded capitals and may also date from the 14th century.<ref name="Committee1904" />

==Vicarage==
A few yards from the entrance gates is the [[Rectory|vicarage]], a long, low, building erected in 1758. The vicarage's formal garden lies alongside the road to the church.<ref name="northumberland.gov.uk" /> The vicarage house is situated on the east of the churchyard, with an extensive prospect to the north. It was either built or re-built by Robert Henderson, vicar of Felton from 1683 to 1726.  Above the south door, there is an inscription date 1683.<ref name="Chronicle1890">{{cite book|author=Newcastle Weekly Chronicle|title=Monthly chronicle of north-country lore and legend|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=m9EGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA551|accessdate=25 October 2011|edition=Public domain|volume=IV, No. 35|date=January 1890|publisher=W.
