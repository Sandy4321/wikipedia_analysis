'''''Sucker Punch''''' is the [[soundtrack]] for the [[Sucker Punch (film)|film of the same name]]. It was released on March 22, 2011 by [[WaterTower Music]]. The album consists of covered songs, mainly by the film's stars. [[Emily Browning]] sings three songs, and [[Carla Gugino]] and [[Oscar Isaac]] performs a cover of "[[Love Is the Drug]]" as a duet. Recording artists [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], [[Skunk Anansie]], [[Emil<U+00ED>ana Torrini]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Carla Azar]], [[Alison Mosshart]] and [[Yoav (musician)|Yoav]] also have songs on the soundtrack.

All of the covers on the album were produced by [[Marius de Vries]] and [[Tyler Bates]], who utilized orchestral and rock sounds. Director [[Zack Snyder]] wanted the songs to add depth, dimension and meaning to the fantasy aspects of the film. The recording sessions began in September 2009. Part of Browning's audition for her role in the film included recording herself while singing. Snyder liked her voice and offered her to sing [[The Smiths]]' song "[[The Boy with the Thorn in His Side (song)|Asleep]]". The crew and Smiths' frontman [[Morrissey]] were happy with the result, and Browning recorded two more songs for the soundtrack, including the [[Eurythmics]]' "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]" which is played during the film's opening sequence.

The album received generally positive reviews. Critics considered it one of the best soundtracks of the year, although the rap by Armageddon in the [[Mashup (music) |mash-up]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[I Want It All]]" and "[[We Will Rock You]]" was cited as the album's bad point. Browning was praised for her performance throughout the album, mainly on "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)". ''Sucker Punch'' reached number twenty-two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and the top of the [[Top Soundtracks]] chart. Internationally, the album reached the top fifty in Australia, New Zealand, Austria and Germany.

I really wanted every aspect of ''Sucker Punch'' to feel unexpected <U+2014> the look, the feel and the sound of what Babydoll and the others go through.

Like with the soundtrack for ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'', director [[Zack Snyder]] decided to go with covers instead of original songs, saying "If you go with the original song, you just get the moment. But if you go with covers you also get all of the baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment."<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/sucker-punch-brings-back-the-event-soundtrack-20110325|title='Sucker Punch' Brings Back the Event Soundtrack |date=2011-03-25|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Wenner Media]]|accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref> The soundtrack was produced by composer [[Tyler Bates]] and musical producer [[Marius de Vries]]. While Bates' job was initally only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" -<ref name=dark>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1568/the-crew-of-sucker-punch|title=Interview: The Crew of "Sucker Punch"|first=Chris|last=Eggertsen|date=2011-03-25|publisher=[[Dark Horizons]]|accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref> the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of "[[Army of Me]]".<ref name=soundtrax>{{cite web|url=http://www.buysoundtrax.com/larsons_soundtrax_4_24_11.html|title=A Super Interview with Tyler Bates|first=Randall|last=Larson|date=2011-04-24|publisher=[[Dark Horizons]]|accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>

Snyder wanted the songs to add depth, dimension and "meaning to the sequences they exist within", as the film includes "multiple levels of reality".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/sucker-punch-ost-due-out-march-22nd/8718587|title="Sucker Punch" OST Due Out March 22nd|date=2011-02-25|last=Sciarretto|first=Amy|accessdate=2011-05-02|publisher=[[Artistdirect]]. Rogue Digital}}</ref> de Vries noted the director tried to use songs instead of an original score "so that the lyrics could help navigate the way through the complex scenes and illuminate Babydoll<U+2019>s state of mind."<ref name=notes/>  Bates said "the songs serve as the link to the conscious world of Babydoll" while the score "was designed to simply underscore the sense of reality in the various alternate realities/action".<ref name=soundtrax/> On the song selection, Snyder said that the tracks were chosen to "resonate" and give the viewer "sort of a nostalgic feeling",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/dailynoise/from-comic-con-zack-snyder-on-sucker-punch-1004106155.story#/column/dailynoise/from-comic-con-zack-snyder-on-sucker-punch-1004106155.story|title=From Comic Con: Zack Snyder on 'Sucker Punch' |date=26 July 2010|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Come|first=Tye|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> and de Vries added that the compositions had to fit the film's "themes of escape and hope, and redemption through the imagination."<ref name=notes/> 

The original script of the film included parts where the characters sang, but it did not make the final cut, and de Vries said, "It was never going to be an opera, or even going to be a musical. It was very unlikely even to have any 'break into song' moments within it, but the fact that we designed it so that it could I think gives it that sort of strange, music-driven resonance."<ref name="RollingStone"/> References to both [[Roxy Music]]'s "[[Love is the Drug]]" and [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]" were seen in the original script,<ref name=notes/> with the former being used in a musical sequence performed by actors [[Carla Gugino]] and [[Oscar Isaac]] "in the style of a [[Bob Fosse]]/''[[Moulin Rouge!|Moulin Rouge]]'' kind of vibe",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Exclusive_Interview_With_Sucker_Punch_Star_Carla_Gugino/7776238|date=2011-03-23|title=Exclusive Interview With Carla Gugino|first=Thomas|last=Leupp|publisher=Hollywood.com|accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref> and the latter being picked by Snyder for his belief that it was "perfect for our World War I [action sequence]". Bates considers [[Emil<U+00ED>ana Torrini]]'s cover of "White Rabbit" to be the soundtrack's standout.<ref name="RollingStone"/> Nine songs are featured in the soundtrack, with Bates saying others were considered and discarded for among other reasons, veto from the original artists and "lyrics too on the nose".<ref name=soundtrax/>

Musically, the songs on ''Sucker Punch'' are highlighted with [[orchestration]]s and a [[rock music|rock]] edge.<ref name="RollingStone"/> De Vries said that during the songs' production "there was substantial ammount of reinvention, in several different directions", helped by Snyder giving the composers free reins. Bates added that there was an attempt to "expand the scope of the songs in a way they were never heard before", with "crazy electronic" and "alternative guitar work" - "it's a bit over the top, but so is everything on screen."<ref name=behind/> The versions of the songs tried to match the action on-screen:<ref name=behind>{{cite video|title=Sucker Punch: Behind the Soundtrack|location=Sucker Punch Blu-Ray|publisher=Warner Home Entertainment}}</ref> Bates detailed that "White Rabbit" "starts out very ethereal, getting [Baby Doll] into the mindset of the dance, and once the girls have their assignment, once they delve in with machineguns and other weapons, the song starts to bloom into this epic, rich, full orchestral choral fanfare."<ref name=notes/> This correspondence lead to the tracks getting longer and alternating between the songs themselves and "a score that is reminiscent of songs sometimes", which Bates described as "playing in the consciousness of the characters [i.e. in the same way most people sometimes keep a song <U+2018>playing<U+2019> in their heads for an extended period of time]."<ref name=dark/> For instance, "White Rabbit" features a choir of 150 voices playing the vocal melody of the first verse of the song, and tracks such as "Search & Destroy" have "moments where Zach really wanted to blow it up into [a] huge orchestra".<ref name=soundtrax/>

Heather Phares of [[Allmusic]] noted that "The setting for [the film] may be a <U+2018>50s mental institution, but the film<U+2019>s soundtrack feels like it<U+2019>s straight out of the <U+2018>90s." The writer also noted that "Nearly every track here [...] pits female vocals against massive, mechanical instrumentation, underscoring the plight from which the film<U+2019>s characters must rescue themselves."<ref name="allmusic"/> The fourth track, a mash-up of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[I Want It All]]" and "[[We Will Rock You]]", includes rap verses by Armageddon, formerly a member of [[Terror Squad (group)|Terror Squad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/first_listen_sucker_punch_will_rock_1mXIZdvJ96P60XHXtVpAiO|title=First Listen: 'Sucker Punch' will 'Rock You'|date=3 March 2011|first=Jarett|last=Wieselman|work=[[The New York Post]]|accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> Phares called the mash-up "an unwelcome reminder of the [[rap-rock]] that overtook the second half of the <U+2018>90s."<ref name="allmusic"/> Torrini's take on "White Rabbit" includes a [[Middle Eastern]]-style outro with guitars and an orchestral pomp.<ref name="artistdirect"/> According to Rick Florino of [[Artistdirect]], the "Sucker Punch Remix" of [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]]'s "[[Army of Me]]" is based upon a [[trip hop]] production and "repeatedly pummels via the psychedelic vocal delivery and careening, crushing guitars".<ref name="artistdirect"/> de Vries considered emblematic of the film's theme of female empowerment having female covers - "White Rabbit", "Search & Destroy", and "Tomorrow Never Knows" - were originally performed by male singersduring the action scenes for the concept of "the female voice telling the story through song (...) where the iconic original performance is a very strong male performance<U+201D>. The artists who would perform the covers were chosen for having "female voices with enough authority and panache and just cultural presence to come out from under the shadow of those performances, and to make this about songs which both comment on the tone of the scene and also help navigate us across the sort of boundaries of these individual worlds which are part of Emily<U+2019>s imagination."<ref name=dark/>

The album received generally positive reviews from critics. Rick Florino of [[Artistdirect]] was very positive on the album, writing that the film "hearkens back to the good old days, and the film's soundtrack is not only one of the best soundtracks this year, it's also bound to be remembered as a classic." The writer praised Browning's take on "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)", writing that it "adds a lush darkness and vibrant vulnerability to the song reminiscent of [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]]'s [[Beth Gibbons]] but with a flair all her own." Florino awarded the album four and a half stars out of five, and concluded his review, writing, "This is the kind of soundtrack that needs to be listened to from front to back, and if it's any indication, the film is destined to be one of the most mind-blowing and magnificent screen event this year, perhaps even the decade."<ref name="artistdirect">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,8718796,00.html|title="Sucker Punch" Soundtrack Review|publisher=Artistdirect.

The reviewer, however, pointed out that the "only true stumble is a mash-up of Queen's <U+201C>I Want It All<U+201D> and <U+201C>We Will Rock You<U+201D> interspersed with a rap by Armageddon".

[[Rovi Corporation]]|ast=Phares|first=Heather|accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref> Writing for ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', Danny Graydon also considered the Queen mash-up to be a weak point, describing it as "by-the-numbers" and finding it to "let down an otherwise strong collection". Graydon highlighted Browning's songs as "seductive takes", and praised both Gugino and Isaac for "an exuberant version of Roxy Music<U+2019>s 'Love Is The Drug'" and considering Bj<U+00F6>rk's collaboration "magnificently reversions 'Army Of Me' with Skunk Anansie".<ref name=empire/> Jon M. Gilbertson of ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' was not very fond of the album, writing that "Maybe these covers make more sense in filmic context, but on their own they exude an air of pointlessness. They are, like Snyder's movies, stylish but curiously hollow."<ref name="JS">{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/118399109.html|title=CD Reviews: The Strokes; 'Sucker Punch' Soundtrack|last=Gilbertson|first=Jon M.|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Journal Communications]]|accessdate=2011-05-03|date=2011-03-22}}</ref>
