'''Aristotle''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|<U+1F08><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03C2>}} ''Aristot<U+00E9>l<U+0113>s'') ([[384 BC]] <U+2013> [[March 7]], [[322 BC]]) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] philosopher, a student of [[Plato]] and teacher of [[Alexander the Great]]. He wrote on diverse subjects, including [[physics]], [[metaphysics]], [[Poetics (Aristotle)|poetry]] (including theater), [[biology]] and [[zoology]], [[logic]], [[rhetoric]], [[politics]], [[government]], and [[ethics]]. Along with [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], Aristotle was one of the most influential of the [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosophers]]. They transformed [[Presocratic]] [[Greek philosophy]] into the foundations of [[Western philosophy]] as we know it. Some consider Plato and Aristotle to have founded two of the most important schools of [[Ancient philosophy]]; others consider [[Aristotelianism]] as a development and concretization of Plato's insights.                                  
 
Aristotle defines philosophy as "the knowledge of being."

==Life==
Aristotle was born in [[Stagira]] in [[Thrace]]. His parents were Phaestis and Nicomachus, who became physician to [[Amyntas III of Macedon|King Amyntas of Macedon]].  Aristotle was educated as a member of the [[aristocracy]].  At about the age of eighteen, he went to [[Athens]] to continue his education at [[Academy|Plato's Academy]].  Aristotle remained at the Academy for nearly twenty years, not leaving until after Plato's death in [[347 BC]].  He then traveled with [[Xenocrates]] to the court of [[Hermias of Atarneus]] in Asia Minor.  While in Asia, Aristotle traveled with [[Theophrastus]] to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island.  Aristotle married Hermias' daughter (or niece) [[Pythias]].  She bore him a daughter, whom they named after his wife, Pythias.  Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]] to become tutor to Alexander the Great.

After spending several years tutoring the young Alexander, Aristotle returned to Athens.  By [[335 BC]], he established his own school there, the [[Lyceum]].  Aristotle directed courses at the Lyceum for the next twelve years.  While in Athens, his wife Pythias died.  Aristotle soon became involved with [[Herpyllis]] of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, [[Nicomachus]].

It is during this time in Athens that Aristotle is thought to have composed many of his works.  Although Aristotle wrote dialogues, only fragments of these have survived. The works that have survived are in [[treatise]] form and, for the most part, were not meant for widespread publication. These are generally thought to be lecture notes or texts used by his students. Among the most important are ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]] (or [[Ontology]])'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[De Anima]] (On the Soul)'' and ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. These works, although connected in many fundamental ways, differ significantly in both style and substance. 

Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In science, Aristotle studied [[anatomy]], [[astronomy]], [[economics]], [[embryology]], [[geography]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], [[physics]], and [[zoology]]. In philosophy, Aristotle wrote on [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[government]], [[metaphysics]], [[politics]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]] and [[theology]]. He also dealt with [[education]], foreign customs, [[literature]] and [[poetry]]. His combined works practically constitute an [[encyclopedia]] of Greek knowledge.  It has been remarked that Aristotle was likely the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.<ref>{{cite book

Upon Alexander's death in [[323 BC]], anti-Macedonian feelings in Athens once again flared.  [[Eurymedon the hierophant]] denounced Aristotle, claiming he did not hold the gods in honor.  Aristotle fled the city to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, explaining, "I will not allow the Athenians to [[Trial of Socrates|sin twice against philosophy]]."<ref>{{cite book

==Methodology==
{{details|Aristotle's theory of universals}}
Aristotle defines his philosophy in terms of [[essence]], saying that philosophy is "the science of the universal essence of that which is [[actual]]". Plato had defined it as the "science of the [[idea]]", meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]]. Both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]; Aristotle, however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, and called it the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[exemplar]]. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas. In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' principles (Jori, 2003).

In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" was a branch of philosophy that studied the phenomena of the natural world, and included matters that today fall under the domain of [[physics]], [[biology]], and other [[natural science]]s. In modern times the scope of ''philosophy'' has come to be more narrowly defined as limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role, and as excluding  the empirical study of the natural world by means of the [[scientific method]]. In contrast, in Aristotle's time and use, [[philosophy]] was taken to encompass all facets of intellectual inquiry.

In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with [[reasoning]], which he also called "science". Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "[[scientific method]]". For Aristotle, "all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical". By practical science he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; while by theoretical science he means physics, [[mathematics]], and metaphysics.

If logic, or, as Aristotle calls it, [[Analytic]], is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy are: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including [[Metaphysics]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], (3) Practical Philosophy; and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

==Aristotle's epistemology==
===Logic===
{{main|Aristotelian logic}}
{{details|Non-Aristotelian logic}}

Aristotle's conception of logic was the dominant form of logic up until the advances in [[mathematical logic]] in the 19th century.  Kant states in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' that Aristotle's theory of logic had arrived at a complete account of the core of deductive inference.

==== History ====
Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'" (Boche<U+0144>ski, 1951). However, Plato reports that [[syntax]] was thought of before him, by [[Prodikos of Keos]], who was concerned by the right use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers used concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' as a rule when discussing, but never understood its logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic. Although he had the idea of constructing a system for [[deduction]], he was never able to construct one. Instead, he relied on his [[dialectic]], which was a confusion between different sciences and methods (Boche<U+0144>ski, 1951). Plato thought that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, so he focused on having good premises so that the [[conclusion]] would follow. Later on, Plato realized that a method for obtaining the conclusion would be beneficial. Plato never obtained such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''Sophist'', where he introduced his division method (Rose, 1968).

====Analytics and the ''Organon''====
{{main|Organon}}
What we today call ''Aristotoihyn logic'', Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean ''dialectics''. Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century AD:
#''Categories''
#''On Interpretation''
#''Prior Analytics''
#''Posterior Analytics''
#''Topics''
#''On Sophistical Refutations''

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and Sophistical Refutations). There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics.'' (Boche<U+0144>ski, 1951).

====Modal logic====
Aristotle is also the creator of syllogisms with modalities (modal logic). The word modal refers to the word 'modes', explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of truth. Aristotle introduced the qualification of 'necessary' and 'possible' premises. He constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was difficult to interpret. (Rose, 1968).

===Science===
[[Image:Francesco Hayez 001.jpg|thumb|right|Aristotle, by Francesco Hayez]]

In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is now most renowned. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle<U+2019>s Metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to Mathematics. He did, however, perform original research in the natural sciences, including: botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, geometry and several other sciences. 

Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, not quantitative. Beginning in the sixteenth century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was found to be hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to lacking concepts like mass, velocity, force, and temperature. He had a notion of what speed and temperature was, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to not having basic experimental apparatus, like a clock or thermometer.

His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, but there are some curious errors. For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein, Galileo showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that the heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect.

In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched [[reason]]. Today's [[scientific method]] assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.

Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots, the largest being his inability to see the application of mathematics to physics. Aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own, whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own. In this philosophy, he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them. He also posited a flawed cosmology that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was  widely accepted up until the 1500s. From the 3rd century to the 1500s, the dominant view held that the Earth was the centre of the universe ([[geocentrism]]). This view has since been rejected.

Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting the immense advances that he made in the many fields of science. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded (in the West) for two millennia. Also, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge. This made the study of physics, and all other sciences, respectable. This observation, though, goes beyond physics and is really the subject matter of metaphysics.

==Aristotle's metaphysics==

Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of [[immaterial]] being", or of "being in the highest degree of abstraction".  He calls metaphysics "first philosophy", and also "the theologic science".
  
===Causality===
The [[Material Cause]] is that from which a thing comes into existence as from its parts, constituents, substratum or materials. This reduces the explanation of causes to the parts (factors, elements, constituents, ingredients) forming the whole (system, structure, compound, complex, composite, or combination) (the part-whole causation).  An example of a material cause might be the marble in a carved statue.

The [[Formal Cause]] tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis, or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (macrostructure) is the cause of its parts (the whole-part causation).   An example of a formal cause might be the sketches or plans of the carved statue.

[[Image:aristotle.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Aristotle]]
The [[Efficient Cause]] is that from which the change or the ending of the change first starts. It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of "cause" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs.  An example of an efficient cause might be the artist who carved the statue.

The [[Final Cause]] is that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve, or it is that from which and that to which the change is. This also covers modern ideas of mental causation involving such psychological causes as volition, need, motivation, or motives, rational, irrational, ethical, all that gives purpose to behavior.  The final cause of the artist might be the statue itself. ([[teleology]])

Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. [Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or action or influence of cause and effect.] Also, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects, its presence and absence may result in different outcomes.

Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.

All further investigations of causality will consist of imposing the favorite hierarchies on the order causes, such as final > efficient> material > formal ([[Thomas Aquinas]]), or of restricting all causality to the material and efficient causes or to the efficient causality (deterministic or chance) or just to regular sequences and correlations of natural phenomena (the natural sciences describing how things happen instead of explaining the whys and wherefores).

===Chance and spontaneity===
Spontaneity and chance are causes of effects. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things. It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

However, chance can only apply to human beings, it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, chance must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance" (''Physics'', 2.6).

===Substance, potentiality and actuality===
Aristotle examines the concept of [[substance]] (''ousia'') in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book VII and he concludes that a particular '''substance''' is a combination of both '''matter''' and '''form'''. As he proceeds to the book VIII, he concludes that the matter of the substance is the [[substratum]] or the stuff of which is composed e.g. the matter of the house are the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house. While the form of the substance, is the ''actual'' house, namely <U+2018>covering for bodies and chattels<U+2019> or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]). The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form (Metaphysics VIII, 1043a 10-30).

With regard to the change (''kinesis'') and its causes now, as he defines in his [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and [[On Generation and Corruption]] 319b-320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from 
1. growth and diminution, which is change in quantity 
2. locomotion, which is change in space and 
3. alteration, which is change in quality. 
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|potentiality]] (''dynamis'') and [[Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)|actuality]] (''entelecheia'') in association with the matter and the form.

Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if it is not prevented from something else. For example, a seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), as well as can be either innate or come by practice or learning. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate - being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise - acting). 

Referring now to actuality, this is the fulfillment of the '''end''' of the potentiality. Because the '''end''' (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that actuality is when the seed of the plant becomes a plant. 
 
<U+201C> For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.<U+201D> (Aristotle, Metaphysics IX 1050a 5-10).

In conclusion, the '''matter''' of the house is its '''potentiality''' and the '''form''' is its '''actuality'''. The [[Formal Cause]] (''aitia'') then of that change from potential to actual house, is the [[reason]] (''logos'') of the house builder and the [[Final Cause]] is the end, namely the house itself. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. 

With this [[definition]] of the [[particular]] substance ('''matter and form''') Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings; ''e.g.'', what is that makes the man one? Since, according to [[Plato]] there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing. (Aristotle, Metaphysics VIII 1045a-b).

===The five elements===
{{main|Five Elements}}
*[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry.
*[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry.
*[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet.
*[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet.
*[[Aether (classical element)|Ether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies (stars and planets).

Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place; the earth at the centre of the universe, then water, then air, then fire. When they are out of their natural place they have natural motion, requiring no external cause, which is towards that place; so bodies sink in water, air bubbles up, rain falls, flame rises in air. The heavenly element has perpetual circular motion.

Aristotle has been criticized on several grounds.
* His analysis of procreation is frequently criticized on the grounds that it presupposes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive, lumpen female element; it is on these grounds that some feminist critics refer to Aristotle as a misogynist.<ref>{{cite book

==Legacy==

Aristotle's system of thought remains the most marvellous and influential one ever put together by any single mind. It may be doubted if any other thinker has contributed so much to the enlightenment of the world.<ref>{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |coauthors= |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |pages= 92}}</ref> He single-handedly founded the sciences of [[Logic]], [[Biology]] and [[Psychology]]. He also anticipated the coming of the [[Industrial revolution]], a full two thousand years in advance by writing in his ''Politics'' (i, 4): "If every instrument could accomplish its own work, obeying or anticipating the will of others,... if the shuttle would weave, or the plectrum touch the lyre, without a hand to guide them, then chief workmen would not need assistants, nor masters slaves".<ref>{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |coauthors= |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |pages= 82}}</ref>

Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by [[Scholastic]] thinkers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]]. See [[''Summa Theologiae'']], Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended  [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], describes his student as being happy by having
{{quote|At his bedded hed<br>
Twenty books clothed in blake or red,<br>

The Italian poet, [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],

The German philosopher, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] has been said to take nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle.<ref>{{cite book |last= Durant |first=Will |authorlink=Will Durant |coauthors= |title=[[The Story of Philosophy]] |year=1926 (2006) |publisher=Simon & Schuster, Inc. |location=[[United States]] |isbn=9780671739164 |pages= 86 fn}} </ref> More recently, Aristotelian ethical and political principles have been revised and reasserted by such philosophers as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Ayn Rand]].

Aristotle's works were lost and rediscovered several times, and it is believed that about one fifth of his original works have survived.

One story of the original manuscripts of his treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''.<ref>"Sulla."</ref>  The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor [[Theophrastus]], who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]].  Neleus supposedly took from [[Athens]] to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the first century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens.  According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text.  When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Appellicon to [[Rome]], where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrranion of Amisus]] and then by philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]].

[[Carnes Lord]] attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C."<ref>Lord, Introduction, 11.</ref>  Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however.  First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.  Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined the cellar in Scepsis.  Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his.  And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelean corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess.  Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelean interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.

After the Roman period, Aristotle's works were by and large lost to the West for a second time.  They were, however, preserved in the East by various [[Muslim]] scholars and philosophers, many of whom wrote extensive commentaries on his works.  Aristotle lay at the foundation of the ''falsafa'' movement in [[Islamic philosophy]], stimulating the thought of [[Al-Farabi]], [[Ibn Sina]], [[Ibn Rushd]] and others.

As the influence of the ''falsafa'' grew in the West, in part due to [[Gerard of Cremona]]'s translations and the spread of [[Averroism]], the demand for Aristotle's works grew.  [[William of Moerbeke]] translated a number of them into Latin.  When [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his [[theology]], working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in [[Europe]].

== Bibliography ==

''Note: [[Bekker numbers]] are often used to uniquely identify passages of Aristotle. They are identified below where available.''

=== Major works ===
The extant works of Aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the ''[[Corpus Aristotelicum]]''. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.<ref>''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.</ref> Not all of these works are considered genuine, but differ with respect to their connection to Aristotle, his associates and his views. Some, such as the ''Athenaion Politeia'' or the fragments of other ''politeia'' are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school" and compiled under his direction or supervision. Other works, such as ''On Colours'' may have been products of Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Straton]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. A final category, omitted here, includes medieval [[palmistries]], [[astrological]] and [[magical]] texts whose connection to Aristotle is purely fanciful and self-promotional. Those that are seriously disputed are marked with an asterisk.
