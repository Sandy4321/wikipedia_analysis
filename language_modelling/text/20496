'''Corona''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] musical project that rose to popularity on the [[popular music]] scene in 1993.

==The Rhythm of The Night==
The project's debut [[single (music)|single]] was "The Rhythm Of The Night". It was released in [[Italy]] in December 1993 on the [[Dance World Attack|DWA]] [[record label]], and became an instant [[hit record|hit]].  It stayed at [[chart-topper|#1]] on the Italian music [[record chart|chart]] for thirteen consecutive weeks.  However, the [[song]] was not released elsewhere until the following year.  Like other [[1990s]] [[Eurodance]]/[[Hi-NRG]] songs that eventually became [[United States|American]] hits as well, such as "[[Get Ready For This]]", "Twilight Zone" and "Tribal Dance" by [[2 Unlimited]] and "Strike It Up", "I Don't Know Anybody Else" and "Everybody Everybody" by [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], "The Rhythm of The Night" did not catch on in the United States until well after its success had peaked in [[Europe]]. By spring 1995, however, the song was all over American [[radio]] and [[nightclub|clubs]], eventually reaching #11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Corona followed up its hit with the 1995 singles "Baby Baby" and "Try Me Out", which saw similar success. The single "I Don't Wanna Be A Star" was a moderate hit. A fifth single, "Do You Want Me", became a regional hit in [[discotheque]]s in the Eastern U.S. The album, ''The Rhythm Of The Night'' sold modestly peaking at #2 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart and #154 on the [[Billboard 200]]. These songs got into the charts in many countries. The vocal at "The Rhythm Of The Night" track is performed by Jenny Bersola. As for the rest of the tracks of the album - the lead(!) vocals are done by Sandy Chambers.

==1998 to 2004==
Corona's second album, ''Walking On Music'' was released in 1998 on independent label of Francesco Bontempi. The album did not produce any major hits in [[Europe]] or [[North America]]. However, the album did yield two minor [[Stateside]] dancehall hits with "Walking On Music" and "The Power Of Love". In 2000, Olga Souza released the third Corona album, this time on the Abril Music label in [[Brazil]]. Francesco Bontempi co-wrote some of the songs on the album, but he did not participate in the album's [[record producer|production]]. The album was called ''And Me U'' and Corona's name was changed to Corona X.

==2005 to present==
Towards the end of 2005, Corona re-emerged onto the European music scene with "Back In Time", peaking at #36 in the Italian sales chart.

In late 2006, Olga De Souza returned with a new single under the Corona moniker entitled "I'll Be Your Lady", which she sang and had co-written herself. 

In 2007, Swedish dance group Sunblock did a [[cover version]] of "Baby Baby" featuring the original singer, [[Sandy Chambers|Sandy]]. Recognition came late for Sandy Chambers whose name is credited on the 2007 Sunblock version of "Baby Baby" whereas she goes completely unmentioned on Corona's album ''Rhythm of the Night'' which includes the same song.
