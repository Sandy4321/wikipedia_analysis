'''Hurricane Nora''' was a [[tropical cyclone]] during the [[1997 Pacific hurricane season]].

==Storm history==
{{storm path|Nora 1997 track.png}}
Nora formed early on [[September 16]], [[1997]], 290 miles (460 km) southwest of [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]], from the same [[tropical wave]] that created 1997's fifth named [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season|Atlantic storm]], [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Erika|Hurricane Erika]]. As the conditions were just right for development of [[tropical cyclone]]s (low [[wind shear]] and very warm water), a tropical disturbance quickly achieved deep convection and became well-organized on the [[September 16]], and was designated Tropical Depression Sixteen-E. At 6 pm [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] the same day, it had gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Nora.

Winds from a [[high pressure area|mid-level high]] centered over northern Mexico forced the storm to move west-northwest for the first few days. However, Nora nearly stalled and became stationary from [[September 18]] to the 20th. There was no longer a visible eye, and convection had decreased significantly. This was later presumed to have happened because of a drop in sea-surface temperatures by up to 2[[degree Celsius|&deg;C]] on average, and Nora's winds weakened to 65 [[mph]].

[[Image:0997Nora211330.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hurricane Nora on the afternoon ([[UTC]]) of [[September 21]], near peak intensity.]]
However, this did not last for long, and later that day on [[September 20]] Nora was moving nearly parallel to the southwestern Mexican coast. A period of rapid intensification began with the eye reappearing, at first at a very small diameter of 15 miles (30 km). Cloud tops cooled and at midday UTC on the 21st, Nora reached its peak intensity of 950 mbar and 130 mph as a [[Category 4 hurricane]].

Nora then took the track of [[Hurricane Linda]] just days before, when Linda had been the most powerful [[:Category:Pacific hurricanes|eastern Pacific]] storm on record. As sea-surface temperatures had cooled in the wake of Linda, Nora started to weaken and its eye diameter grew. The [[eyewall]] of Nora broke, and winds decreased to 80 [[mph]] by [[September 23]].

However, Nora then crossed an area of water with abnormally high sea-surface temperatures abutting the west coast of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. It restrengthened slightly before making first landfall near [[Punta Euguenia]] and then did not weaken as it moved back over water before making a second landfall, still at hurricane strength, about 60 miles south-southeast of [[San Fernando, Baja California]].

At landfall, Nora was accelerating, urged on by a [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to its northwest, causing it to cross the peninsula at speeds of up to 30 mph. Late on [[September 25]] (UTC), it entered the [[continental United States]] near the [[United States|American]] border at the [[California]]-[[Arizona]] state line, still as a tropical storm.

Rapid weakening followed and Nora had weakened to a tropical depression three hours later, at midnight on [[September 26]]. The low-level center was moving toward the north-northeast as it degenerated early on the 26th. A remnant circulation aloft persisted, however, and is likely to have been responsible for a period of near hurricane-force winds observed at the [[National Weather Service|NWS]] [[Cedar City, Utah]] [[Doppler radar]], located in the mountains of southwestern Utah at an elevation of about 10,600 feet.

The residual area of cloudiness and showers gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward, through portions of [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]] and [[Wyoming]].

===Storm numbers===
Sustained winds of nearly 45 mph were observed at [[Yuma, Arizona]] during Nora's passage. Such observations of tropical storm force winds are a rarity in the United States for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones. The peak gust observed at Yuma was 54 mph. A gust to 52 mph also occurred at [[Ajo, Arizona]].

The NWS Doppler radar at Yuma showed a 45 mile wide band of hurricane force winds aloft to the east of Nora's center near the [[Arizona]]-[[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] border near noon on [[September 25]]. These winds were observed at about 4-5,000 ft, possibly extending to higher altitudes, and likely were related to the patch of near-hurricane force winds observed over the high terrain of southwestern Utah 12-18 hours later.

The Yuma radar indicated a small area with near 10 inches of rain along the northern Gulf of California coast of Baja California. In the United States, the 11.97 inches recorded at the 5700 ft level in the [[Harquahala Mountains]] in Arizona was the largest total. More than three inches occurred in some spots in Arizona, California, [[Nevada]], and Utah. Some of the amounts were comparable to the local yearly average rainfall.

== Impact ==
=== Casualties ===
Two deaths were reported from [[Mexico]] in association with Nora. One person was electrocuted by a downed power line in [[Mexicali]]. The other fatality occurred to a diver caught in strong underwater currents created by Nora off the coast of the [[San Quintin Valley]]. In the [[United States]], there were no deaths directly related to Nora. The [[California Highway Patrol]] attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern [[California]] to weather.

=== Damages ===

Although Nora remained well offshore from southwestern mainland Mexico, the [[Associated Press]] reported that waves to 16 feet hit that coastline, destroying dozens of homes. It also destroyed some beaches of [[Acapulco]].

About 350 to 400 people were made homeless by floodwaters in the town of [[Arroyo de Santa Catarina]] in northern [[Baja California]]. Heavy damage and flooding was reported in [[San Felipe]], on the northwestern shore of the [[Gulf of California]]. On the northeastern shore, at [[Puerto Pe<U+00F1>asco]], Nora's winds blew down trees, billboards, electric wires, taco stands, and ripped sheet-metal from homes. Waves of 10 feet were reported there.

Damage totals in the United States are not fully known but media summaries of Nora included a loss to agriculture preliminarily estimated at several hundred million dollars. About a $30 to 40 million loss to [[lemon]] trees was estimated.

Flooding was reported in [[Somerton, Arizona|Somerton]], [[San Diego]], [[El Centro]], [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Indio]], while people lost power in Yuma, [[Los Angeles]] and southwestern Utah.
