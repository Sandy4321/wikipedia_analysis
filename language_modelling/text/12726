Cronin was released by the Tigers on June 8, 1902, and he signed with the [[New York Yankees|Baltimore Orioles]] that same day. However, the Orioles struggled with debt.

With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder, owning 201 of the team's 400 shares.<ref name=mcallistersabr>{{cite web|first=Jimmy |last=Keenan |url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/fae12278 |title=Sport McAllister |publisher=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |date= |accessdate=April 7, 2012}}</ref> On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold his interest in the Orioles to [[Andrew Freedman]], principal owner of the Giants of the NL, and [[John T. Brush]], principal owner of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], also of the NL. That day, Freedman released Cronin, Kelley, [[Dan McGann]], [[Cy Seymour]], [[Roger Bresnahan]], and [[Joe McGinnity]] from their contracts with Orioles. Freedman signed Cronin, McGann, Bresnahan, and McGinnity and to the Giants, joining McGraw, who had signed with the Giants ten days earlier.
