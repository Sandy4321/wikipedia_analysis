'''Iris Clert''' was the owner of the [[Galerie Iris Clert]] from 1955 to 1971.  During its tenure, her gallery became an avant-garde hotspot in the international art scene, particularly to [[Yves Klein]], [[Jean Tinguely]], and [[Arman]].

Originally of [[Greece|Greek]] nationality, Clert became an overnight [[socialite]] with the success of her gallery.

Clert was active in the [[French Resistance]] during the [[Second World War]].

In 1961, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], who would become one of the forerunners of the [[Pop Art]] movement, was invited to participate in an exhibition at the Galerie, in which the artists were to create and display a portrait of Iris Clert.   Rauschenberg proceeded to send a [[telegram]] to the Galerie, containing the words "This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so/ Robert Rauschenberg".  This was a significant move for Rauschenberg and the artistic community, signifying a step away from the [[Neo-Dada]]ist work of [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Jasper Johns]] - which tended to focus on the role of the ''observer'' in applying meaning to a work of art - and toward a more active role of the ''creator'' in defining art's meaning.
