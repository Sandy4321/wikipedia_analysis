'''Nikephoros Melissenos''' ({{lang-el|<U+039D><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03B7><U+03C6><U+03CC><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+039C><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}), [[Latinisation (literature)|latinized]] as '''Nicephorus Melissenus''', was a [[Byzantine]] general and aristocrat. Of distinguished lineage, he served as a governor and general in the [[Balkans]] and [[Asia Minor]] in the 1060s. In the turbulent period after the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (1071), several generals tried to seize the throne for themselves. Melissenos remained loyal to [[Michael VII Doukas]] and was exiled by his successor [[Nikephoros III Botaneiates]]. In 1080<U+2013>1081, with Turkish aid, he seized control of what remained of Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] and proclaimed himself emperor. After the revolt of his brother-in-law [[Alexios I Komnenos]] however, which succeeded in taking [[Constantinople]], he submitted to him, accepting the rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the governance of [[Thessalonica]]. He remained loyal to Alexios thereafter, participating in most Byzantine campaigns of the period 1081<U+2013>1095 at the emperor's side. He died on 17 November 1104.

== Early life and career ==
Nikephoros Melissenos was probably born ca. 1045 at [[Dorylaeum]], where his family had extensive estates. Through both his father and his mother, he was of aristocratic descent: his father belonged to the [[Bourtzes]] line, while his mother to the illustrious [[Melissenos]] family, which dated back to the 8th century and had produced several distinguished generals.<ref name="ODB">Kazhdan (1991), p. 1335</ref><ref name="EHW1">Nikolia (2003), [http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=12566&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_1 Chapter 1]</ref> Already sometime before 1067, Nikephoros married Eudokia Komnene, the second daughter of the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[John Komnenos (Domestic of the Schools)|John Komnenos]] and [[Anna Dalassene]] and sister of the future emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081<U+2013>1118). They had at least one known son, who was named John Komnenos.<ref name="ODB"/><ref name="EHW1"/><ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 240, 244</ref>

Melissenos held the rank of ''[[magistros]]'' and the post of ''[[dux|doux]]'' of Triaditza (modern [[Sofia]]) for some time during the 1060s. In 1070, he joined the field army commanded by his eldest brother-in-law, the ''[[protostrator]]'' [[Manuel Komnenos (protostrator)|Manuel Komnenos]], in a campaign against the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The campaign ended in defeat near Sebasteia (modern [[Sivas]]), and Melissenos along with Manuel Komnenos were captured by a Turkish chieftain whom the Byzantines called Chrysoskoulos. Manuel however quickly persuaded the Turk to enter into Byzantine service, and their captivity ended.<ref name="EHW2">Nikolia (2003), [http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=12566&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_2 Chapter 2]</ref>

Melissenos remained loyal to [[Michael VII Doukas]] (r. 1071<U+2013>1078) during the rebellion of the ''[[strategos]]'' of the [[Anatolic Theme]], [[Nikephoros Botaneiates]] (Nikephoros III), which began in October 1077. Michael VII rewarded him by appointing him to Botaneiates' post, but after Botaneiates' victory and entry into [[Constantinople]] in April 1078, Melissenos was exiled to the island of [[Kos]].<ref name="EHW2"/><ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 240<U+2013>241</ref>

== Rebellion ==
In autumn 1080, Melissenos left Kos and returned to Asia Minor. There he succeeded in gaining the support of the local population, and in recruiting many Turkish tribesmen as mercenaries to his army. One by one the cities of western Asia Minor opened up their gates to him, and Turkish garrisons were installed in them. Botaneiates tried to send Alexios Komnenos, who had recently suppressed the revolts of [[Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder|Nikephoros Bryennios]] and [[Nikephoros Basilakes]], against him, but he refused. In February 1081, Melissenos' troops took [[Iznik|Nicaea]], where he was acclaimed as emperor, and defeated a loyalist army under the eunuch John.<ref name="Skoulatos241">Skoulatos (1980), p. 241</ref><ref name="EHW3">Nikolia (2003), [http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=12566&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_3 Chapter 3]</ref><ref>Angold (1997), p. 119</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 610</ref>

In March 1081, Melissenos was encamped with his army at [[<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar|Damalis]], on the Asian shore across the [[Bosporus]] from Constantinople. There he received news of the revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates and the proclamation of Alexios Komnenos as emperor. He sent letters to the Komnenoi, suggesting a division of authority over the imperial territory, with the Balkans remaining under Komnenian control and himself keeping Asia Minor, although he also emphasized that the empire should remain united.<ref name="Skoulatos241"/> In reply, the Komnenoi offered to recognize him as ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' <U+2013> the second highest dignity after the imperial title itself <U+2013> and to give him the governance of [[Thessalonica]] <U+2013> the Empire's second-most important city <U+2013> if he would submit to them. Melissenos initially refused to accept this offer, but as the Komnenoi were on the verge of taking Constantinople and might refuse to treat with him later, he eventually agreed.<ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 241<U+2013>242</ref>

At the same time, the emperor Nikephoros Botaneiates tried to forestall the capital's fall to the Komnenoi by sending for Melissenos and asking him to enter the city and assume the imperial authority. His envoys however were obstructed by [[George Palaiologos]] and never reached Melissenos.<ref name="Skoulatos242">Skoulatos (1980), p. 242</ref> Constantinople fell to the Komnenian forces, and on 8 April 1081, Melissenos too entered the imperial capital. True to his word, Alexios I raised him to ''Caesar'' and gave him authority over Thessalonica as well as allotting the city's revenues to his income. At the same time however, Alexios raised his brother [[Isaac Komnenos (brother of Alexios I)|Isaac Komnenos]] to the newly created dignity of ''[[sebastokrator]]'', which he placed above that of ''Caesar'', bypassing Melissenos.<ref name="Skoulatos242"/><ref>Angold (1997), pp. 128, 149</ref><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 613</ref>

Melissenos' revolt was over, but it left a profound legacy: although he submitted to Alexios, the Asian towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers remained in their hands. By becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies, the Turks thus completed their relatively peaceful take-over of western and northwestern Asia Minor.<ref>Angold (1997), pp. 119<U+2013>120</ref>

== Service under Alexios Komnenos ==
Melissenos continued to serve Alexios I faithfully throughout the rest of his life.<ref name="Skoulatos242"/><ref>Treadgold (1997), p. 614</ref> In autumn 1081, he marched alongside Alexios in his campaign against the [[Normans]] of [[Robert Guiscard]]. In the [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|Battle of Dyrrhachium]], which ended in a crushing Byzantine defeat, he commanded the Byzantine army's right wing.<ref name="Skoulatos242"/><ref name="EHW4">Nikolia (2003), [http://asiaminor.ehw.gr/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaid=12566&boithimata_State=&kefalaia_State=#chapter_4 Chapter 4]</ref><ref>Angold (1997), p. 150</ref> 

In the 1083 campaign in [[Thessaly]] against the Normans, who, under Guiscard's son [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] were besieging [[Larissa]], Melissenos was used by Alexios as the centerpiece to a ruse. The emperor gave him the imperial insignia and a detachment of the army, which Bohemond proceeded to attack in the belief that this was the main Byzantine force, since the emperor was present with it. While the Normans pursued Melissenos' men, Alexios with the main army took and looted the Norman camp, forcing Bohemond to lift the siege and withdraw.<ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 242<U+2013>243</ref>

Melissenos fought alongside Alexios in the battle of Dristra (late August 1087) against the [[Pechenegs]], commanding the Byzantine left wing. The battle ended in a heavy Byzantine defeat, and Melissenos was taken captive along with many other Byzantines, to be ransomed by the emperor after some time.<ref name="EHW4"/><ref>Skoulatos (1980), p. 243</ref> In spring 1091, Melissenos was sent to [[Aenus (Thrace)|Ainos]] to recruit soldiers from among the [[Bulgarians]] and [[Vlachs]]. Occupied with this task, he did not join the imperial army in time for the crushing Byzantine victory over the Pechenegs at [[Battle of Levounion|Levounion]] on 29 April, arriving the next day.<ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 243<U+2013>244</ref> 

Later in the same year he participated in the family council of [[Philippopolis]] which examined the accusations of conspiracy raised against [[John Komnenos (governor of Dyrrhachium)|John Komnenos]], the ''doux'' of [[Dyrrhachium]] by the [[Archbishop of Ochrid]] [[Theophylact of Ohrid|Theophylact]]. The council degenerated into a heated family quarrel, where John's father, the ''sebastokrator'' Isaac, accused Melissenos and [[Adrian Komnenos]] of slandering his son, but in the end Alexios dismissed the charges.<ref>Skoulatos (1980), pp. 136, 244</ref> 

In the 1095 campaign against the [[Cumans]], Melissenos, along with [[George Palaiologos]] and [[John Taronites]] were left in charge of defending the region of Berrhoe (modern [[Stara Zagora]]) against Cuman attacks. This is the last mention of Melissenos in [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''[[Alexiad]]''. He died on 17 November 1104.<ref name="EHW4"/><ref>Skoulatos (1980), p. 244</ref>
