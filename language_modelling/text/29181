'''Brett Andrew Hull''' (born August 9, 1964) is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] former [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player and general manager, and currently an executive vice president of the [[St. Louis Blues]].  He played for the [[Calgary Flames]], [[St. Louis Blues]], Dallas Stars, [[Detroit Red Wings]] and [[Phoenix Coyotes]] between 1986 and 2005. His career total of 741 [[goal (ice hockey)|goals]] is the third highest in NHL history, and he is one of five players to score [[50 goals in 50 games]]. He was a member of two [[Stanley Cup]] winning teams. His championship winning goal for Dallas in [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] of game six of the [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals]] is one of the most controversial in league history and remains the focus of debate over whether it was scored within the rules of the time.

Known as one of the game's greatest [[List of ice hockey terminology#S|snipers]], Hull was an elite scorer at all levels of the game. He played college hockey for the [[Minnesota<U+2013>Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey|University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs]], where he scored 52 goals in 1985<U+2013>86. He scored 50 the following year with the [[Moncton Golden Flames]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) and had five consecutive NHL seasons of at least 50 goals. His 86 goals in [[1990<U+2013>91 NHL season|1990<U+2013>91]] is the third highest single-season total in NHL history. Hull won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and [[Ted Lindsay Award|Lester B. Pearson Award]] that year as the league's most valuable player. He was named a [[NHL All-Star Team|first team all-star]] on three occasions and played in eight [[NHL All-Star Game]]s.

A dual citizen, Hull was eligible to play for either Canada or the United States internationally and chose to join the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|American National Team]]. He was a member of team that won the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]] and was a two-time [[Olympic Games|Olympian]], winning a silver medal at the [[ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]]. Hull was inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in 2009, joining his father [[Bobby Hull|Bobby]] to become the first father-and-son pair of players in the Hall. They are the only pair to each score [[List of NHL players with 1000 points|1,000 career points]] in the NHL. Hull's nickname, "the Golden Brett" is a reference to his father's nickname of "the Golden Jet". His jersey number 16 was [[List of NHL retired numbers|retired]] by the St. Louis Blues.

==Early life==
Hull was born August 9, 1964, in [[Belleville, Ontario]]. His father, [[Bobby Hull|Bobby]], was a long-time professional hockey player in both the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA).  His mother, Joanne, was an American professional [[figure skating|figure skater]] and taught him how to skate. He has three brothers: Bobby Jr., Blake and [[Bart Hull|Bart]], and a younger sister: Michelle.<ref name="LOH1on1">{{cite web |last=Shea |first=Kevin |url=http://www.hhof.com/htmlSpotlight/spot_oneononep200901.shtml |title=One on one with Brett Hull |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref> Bart played professional football in the [[Canadian Football League]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Kay |first=Linda |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-21/sports/9103020323_1_ottawa-rough-riders-bobby-hull-canadian-football-league |title=Bart Hull Takes His Shot At Football |work=Chicago Tribune |date=1991-08-21 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref> His uncle [[Dennis Hull|Dennis]] was also a long-time NHL player.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiner |first=Evan |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=504636 |title=Brett Hull's longest three hours |publisher=National Hockey League |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>

As his father was playing for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]], Hull's early life was spent in Illinois, and he first played organized hockey in the Chicago area at the age of four.<ref name="ParentsDivorce" /> He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972<U+2013>96)|Winnipeg Jets]] in 1972. Brett moved to [[Vancouver]] with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979.<ref name="ParentsDivorce">{{cite news |last=Farber |first=Michael |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OAciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u6QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1010,4003699 |title=What really happened to Joanne and Bobby Hull |work=Montreal Gazette |date=1980-12-18 |accessdate=2012-08-10 |page=1}}</ref> Hull was not close to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.<ref name="FathersSon" />

==Playing career==
===Junior and college===
Admitting that he was viewed as a "pudgy, fun-loving, music-crazed bum" in his youth, Hull stated in his autobiography that he was not surprised when he failed to attract the attention of a [[junior hockey|junior]] team.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> He was first eligible for the [[NHL Entry Draft]] in 1982, but as he was still playing in a juvenile league, was passed over without interest. He joined the [[Penticton Knights]] of the tier-II [[British Columbia Hockey League|British Columbia Junior Hockey League]] (BCJHL) in the 1982<U+2013>83 season where he scored 48 goals in 50 games. He was again passed over at the 1983 Entry Draft as teams remained unconvinced of his commitment to the game and his conditioning.<ref name="MyFirstGoal">{{cite book |last=Brophy |first=Mike |title=My First Goal: 50 players and the goal that marked the beginning of their NHL careers |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |year=2011 |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-7710-1682-0 |pages=237<U+2013>241}}</ref> NHL teams finally took notice of Hull following his 1983<U+2013>84 season in which he scored 105 goals in 56 games and broke the BCJHL scoring record with 188 points.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> The [[Calgary Flames]] selected him in the sixth round of the [[1984 NHL Entry Draft]], 117th overall.<ref name="8788FlamesMG" />

Hull accepted a scholarship to play for the [[Minnesota<U+2013>Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey|University of Minnesota-Duluth]] (UMD), and in 1984<U+2013>85, scored 32 goals as a freshman.

===Calgary Flames===
Choosing to turn professional following his sophomore season, Hull signed a contract with the Flames and joined the team during the [[1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs]]. He made his NHL debut on May 20, 1986, in game three of the [[1986 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Montreal Canadiens]].  His best scoring opportunity came when he hit the post in his first [[Glossary of ice hockey terms#S|shift]] of the game. He appeared in two games of the Flames' five-game series loss to Montreal.<ref name="MyFirstGoal" />

The Flames assigned Hull to their [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) affiliate, the [[Moncton Golden Flames]], for the majority of the [[1986<U+2013>87 AHL season|1986<U+2013>87 season]]. He scored 50 goals, tying an AHL rookie record,<ref name="8788FlamesMG" /> and his 93 points was third best in the league.  He won the [[Dudley "Red" Garrett Memorial Award]] as the league's rookie of the year and was named to the first all-star team.<ref name="LOH1on1" /> He earned a brief recall to Calgary during the season. He made his regular season debut on November 13, 1986, against the [[Hartford Whalers]] and scored his first NHL goal against [[Steve Weeks]] on a [[Breakaway (ice hockey)|breakaway]]. It was the game-winning goal in a 4<U+2013>3 victory.<ref name="MyFirstGoal" /> Hull appeared in five regular season games for the Flames and played in four playoff games where he scored two goals and added an assist.<ref name="LOHStats">{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/LegendsOfHockey/jsp/LegendsMember.jsp?mem=p200901&type=Player&page=statsawards&list= |title=Brett Hull statistics |publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame |accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>

Hull earned a spot on the Flames for the [[1987<U+2013>88 NHL season]], though the team continued to work with him on his conditioning.<ref name="LOH1on1" />  He appeared in 52 games for the Flames, scoring 26 goals and 50 points.<ref name="LOHStats" /> He did not finish the season in Calgary however. On March 7, 1988, Hull was traded, along with [[Steve Bozek]], to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for defenseman [[Rob Ramage]] and goaltender [[Rick Wamsley]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3874160.html |title=Blues get Hull; Moog to Bruins |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1988-03-08 |accessdate=2012-07-28}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref>

===St. Louis Blues===
{{Quote box| quote ="The year he scored 86, it was just magical. It was one of those years, wherever we went Brett would score two goals or a hat trick. It was just fantastic.

Hull led the Blues with 41 goals in [[1988<U+2013>89 NHL season|1988<U+2013>89]], but his poor skating and inattention to his defensive responsibilities concerned the club.  Head coach [[Brian Sutter]] convinced Hull to improve his conditioning over the summer. He arrived to begin the [[1989<U+2013>90 NHL season|1989<U+2013>90 season]] in dramatically better shape and showed a marked improvement in his skating.<ref name="SIapoppin" /> Center [[Adam Oates]], acquired over the summer, joined Hull on the top line.

He led the league in goal scoring all three seasons and was named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|first all-star team]] each year. He collected numerous league awards, winning the [[Lady Byng Memorial Trophy]] in 1990 as the league's most sportsmanlike player, then in 1991, won the [[Hart Memorial Trophy]] and [[Ted Lindsay Award|Lester B.

The Sabres immediately protested the goal, as NHL rules of the time stated that a player could not score a goal if any part of his body was within the goal crease. Replays showed that Hull's skate was within the crease when he scored; however, the NHL ruled that he had possession of the puck prior to entering the crease, making the goal legal.

As a dual Canadian and American citizen, Hull was eligible to play for either country internationally.

==Playing style==
Upon his arrival in the NHL, Hull was considered a "one-dimensional player".<ref name="FathersSon">{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1297599.html |title=Brett Hull: Father's son in name, skill only |work=Washington Post |date=1988-12-27 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> He was a natural goal scorer with a reputation for being uninterested in [[backchecking]] and playing defense.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers">{{cite book |last=Podnieks |first=Andrew |title=Players: The ultimate A<U+2013>Z guide of everyone who has ever played in the NHL |publisher=Doubleday Canada |year=2003 |location=Toronto |pages=382<U+2013>383 |isbn=0-385-25999-9}}</ref> He was nicknamed "The Incredible Hull" in college for his scoring exploits and was referred to in the NHL as the "The Golden Brett", a play on his father's nickname of "The Golden Jet".<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />  Brett was often compared to Bobby in his early years, though the two shared few similarities on the ice.<ref name="FathersSon" />  Both were known for their shooting ability, particularly the power of their [[slapshot]], which [[Terry Crisp]] <U+2013> who played against Bobby and coached Brett <U+2013> described as "explosive".<ref>{{cite news |last=Rosa |first=Francis |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8038126.html |title=A new Flame has an old name.

His reputation for defensive indifference persisted through much of his career.  In his 72-goal season of 1988<U+2013>89, Hull's [[plus-minus]] (net difference of even strength and shorthanded goals scored for and against while he was on the ice) was <U+2212>1.  He was a <U+2212>27 four years later despite scoring 54 goals.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" /> Hull also carried a reputation as a player who could not win as his Blues' teams rarely achieved success in the playoffs.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rutherford |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-137677523.html |title=Hull leaves lasting mark on hockey |work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |date=2005-10-18 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> He shed that reputation after leading his teams to championships at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. To win that 1999 championship, Hull also had to fit in with the Dallas Stars' defense-oriented system.  He finished that season with a career best plus-minus of +19.<ref name="PodnieksPlayers" />

Known as an outspoken player, Hull earned a reputation on and off the ice for speaking bluntly and without regard for whom it might offend.<ref name="SIShooting" />  He chastised his own fans in 1992 <U+2013> later backtracking <U+2013> when they booed Adam Oates following Oates' trade request, calling them "losers" and stating he wanted to rip one particular fan's head off.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dellapina |first=John |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-22618460.html |title=Oates' threat sets off quaking in St. Louis |work=The Record (Bergen County, NJ) |date=1992-01-20 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}{{subscription required|via=Highbeam}}</ref> Hull was a consistent critic of the NHL's defensive, "clutch and grab" era of the late 1990s, raising the ire of commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] in 1998 when he said "I wouldn't pay to watch.

The pair made one of the most prominent trades in the [[2007<U+2013>08 NHL season]], acquiring [[Brad Richards]] from the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] as part of a five-player trade.  The team went on to reach the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] Final of the [[2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], the Stars' deepest playoff run in eight years. Team owner [[Tom Hicks]] rewarded the pair with three-year contracts and named them permanent co-general managers.
