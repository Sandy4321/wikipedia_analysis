'''Edward V''' (2 November 1470 &ndash; 29 July 1483?) was [[King of England]] from [[9 April]] 1483 until his deposition two months later. His reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who succeeded him as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]]. Along with his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], Edward was one of the [[Princes in the Tower]], who disappeared after being sent (ostensibly for their own safety) to the [[Tower of London]]. Richard III has been widely blamed for their deaths, but what actually happened remains a mystery.

Along with [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], [[Empress Matilda]] and [[Lady Jane Grey]], Edward V is one of only four post-1066 English monarchs never to have been [[coronation|crowned]]. If, as seems probable, he died before his fifteenth birthday, he is the shortest lived monarch in English history (his great-nephew [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] died in his sixteenth year).

==Early life==
Edward was born in [[sanctuary]] within [[Westminster Abbey]] during a period when his mother, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], was taking refuge from [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] who had temporarily removed his father, King [[Edward IV of England]], from power in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Edward V was created [[Prince of Wales]] in June, 1471, following Edward IV's restoration to the throne, and appeared with his parents on State occasions.

King Edward IV concluded an alliance in 1480 with the Duke of [[Brittany]], [[Francis II of Brittany|Francis II]], and both decided to betroth their heirs, Edward (10 years old) and [[Anne, Duchess of Brittany|Anne]] (4 years old), to each other, promising to marry them at their majority. The devolution of Brittany would have been given to the second child to be born, the first becoming prince of Wales. Those plans disappeared together with Edward V.

==Reign==
Edward IV, having established a [[Council of Wales and the Marches]], sent his son to [[Ludlow Castle]] to be its nominal president.  It was at [[Ludlow]] that the prince was staying when news came of his father's sudden death. Edward inherited the throne on [[9 April]] [[1483]], at the age of twelve, but it took until [[11 April]] for news of his accession to be made public in London.  His father's brother [[Richard III of England|Richard]], Duke of Gloucester, was entrusted with the role of Protector to his young nephews, Edward V and [[Richard, Duke of York (Prince in the Tower)|Richard, Duke of York]].  He intercepted Edward's entourage on its return journey from [[Wales]] and escorted the prince to [[London]].  Less than three months later, Richard took the throne himself.  On [[25 June]]  Parliament [[Titulus Regius|declared his nephews illegitimate]] after clergyman [[Ralph Shaa]] presented evidence that Edward had contracted to marry [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]] before he married [[Elizabeth Woodville]]; this would have made his marriage to Elizabeth invalid.  Richard's other brothers, Edmund and [[George, Duke of Clarence]], had both died before Edward, leaving Richard next in line for the throne.

==Imprisonment==
After the two boys went into the [[Tower of London]], they were never seen in public again.  What happened to them is one of the great mysteries of history, and many books have been written on the [[Princes in the Tower|subject]].  It is generally believed that they were killed, and the three principal suspects are their uncle, [[Richard III of England|King Richard]]; [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]; and [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], who defeated Richard and took the throne as Henry VII.

==Legacy==
[[Image:DelarocheKingEdward.jpg|thumb|King Edward V and the Duke of York in the Tower of London by [[Paul Delaroche]]. The theme of innocent children awaiting an uncertain fate was a popular one amongst 19th-century painters.]]

After the princes' disappearance, there was much uncertainty as to their fate.  If they were killed, the secret was well kept; conversely, there was no evidence of their survival or of their having been shipped out of the country.  When a [[pretender]], [[Perkin Warbeck]], turned up claiming to be Prince Richard, in 1495, William Stanley (younger brother of King Henry's stepfather, [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby]]), who, despite his [[Yorkist]] sympathies, had turned against Richard III at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] and helped [[King Henry VII]] win it, said that, if the young man was really the prince, he would not fight against him, thus demonstrating that some Yorkists had not given up hope of the princes' survival.  

In 1674, some workmen remodelling the [[Tower of London]] dug up a box containing two small human skeletons.  They threw them on a rubbish heap, but some days or weeks later someone decided they might be the bones of the two princes, so they gathered them up and put some of them in an urn that [[Charles II of England]] ordered interred in [[Westminster Abbey]].  In 1933 the bones were taken out and examined and then replaced in the urn in the vault under the Abbey.  The experts who examined them could not agree on what age the children would have been when they died or even whether they were boys or girls.  (One skeleton was larger than the other, and many of the bones were missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one.)
