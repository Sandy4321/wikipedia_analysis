'''"Deuce"''' is a song written by [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] [[bass guitar|bassist]]/vocalist [[Gene Simmons]] that first appeared on KISS' eponymous [[1974]] [[KISS (album)|debut album]].  Live versions appear on ''[[Alive! (album)|Alive!]]'' (performed by the original KISS lineup of Simmons, [[guitar]]ists [[Paul Stanley]] and [[Ace Frehley]] and [[drums|drummer]] [[Peter Criss]]), ''[[Alive III]]'' (which featured the lineup of Simmons, Stanley, guitarist [[Bruce Kulick]] and drummer [[Eric Singer]]), ''[[Kiss Symphony: Alive IV|Alive IV]]'' (which featured the lineup of Simmons, Stanley, Criss' and [[Tommy Thayer]]), and ''[[Kiss Alive! 1975-2000|Alive! The Millennium Concert]]'' (With the Original Lineup) 

Remastered or reworked versions have appeared on later KISS compilation albums such as ''[[Double Platinum (album)|Double Platinum]]'' and ''[[Smashes, Thrashes & Hits]]''.

"Deuce", in addition to being one of the band's most popular and most-[[cover song|covered]] songs, is a traditional concert opener.

According to Gene Simmons, he simply copped the bassline of [[The Rolling Stones|The Rolling Stones']] ''"[[Bitch (song)|Bitch]]"'' and played it more or less backwards.  He says he wrote the entire song nearly linearly; the riff came first, then the bridge, then finally the chorus.

"Deuce" also has special significance for Ace Frehley, who calls it his favorite KISS song.

"When I auditioned for KISS", recalls Frehley, "they said, 'We're going to play you a song for you to listen to, and then try playing along &mdash; it's in the [[key (music)|key]] of '[[A]]'.  They played ["Deuce"] as a three-piece.  I thought, 'That's easy enough,' so I got up and wailed for four minutes playing lead work over it."

Paul Stanley admits the lightly [[Phaser (effect)|phased]] intro was copped from a song called "Go All the Way" by [[The Raspberries]].

The lyrics for "Deuce" are rather ambiguous, Gene Simmons admitted, "Lyrically, I had no idea what I was talking about. Sometimes stuff means a lot, sometimes it means nothing."

It has been widely construed by fans as a song about a man having two sexual encounters with a woman on the same night.

One of the more well-known cover versions appeared on the official KISS-authorized tribute album, ''[[KISS My Ass]]''. It was performed by [[Lenny Kravitz]] with [[Stevie Wonder]] guesting on [[harmonica]].  Ace Frehley has played "Deuce" live during his solo career and a live version of it appears on his [[1997]] album, ''[[12 Picks]]''.
