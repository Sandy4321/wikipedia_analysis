==Early life==
Born in [[Tokyo]], Yamamoto attended [[Keio University]] where he helped form a film appreciation society.<ref name="Kantoku">{{cite book|author=Yamane Sadao|title=Nihon eiga jinmei jiten: Kantoku hen|year=1997|publisher=Kinema Junp<U+014D>|location=Tokyo|language=Japanese|pages=867<U+2013>870|chapter=Yamamoto Kajir<U+014D>}}</ref> He first appeared in film in 1921 as an actor opposite [[Yoshiko Okada]], but that only earned the wrath of his family, who disowned him.<ref name="Kantoku" /> 

==Career==
He worked as an actor on the stage, joined [[Nikkatsu]] as an assistant director, and finally made his directorial debut in 1924 at [[T<U+014D>a Kinema]].<ref name="Kantoku" /> After working at Nikkatsu again, he was lured to [[Toho|Photo Chemical Laboratories]] (P. C. L.) in 1934, where he first made a name filming the comedies of [[Kenichi Enomoto]].<ref name="kotobank">{{cite web|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%B1%B1%E6%9C%AC%E5%98%89%E6%AC%A1%E9%83%8E|title=Yamamoto Kajir<U+014D>|work=Nihon jinmei daijiten + Plus|publisher=K<U+014D>dansha|language=Japanese|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref> When P. C. L. became the [[Toho]] company, Yamamoto helmed realist dramas such as ''[[Tsuzurikata ky<U+014D>shitsu]]'' and ''[[Horse (film)|Uma]]'' (starring [[Hideko Takamine]]), and war films such as ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]''.<ref name="kotobank" />

After [[World War II]], he continued directing films, but increasingly worked in television and radio.<ref name="kotobank" />

==Legacy==
He is now mostly known as the mentor of [[Akira Kurosawa]], who served as his assistant director on 17 films.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Stephen|title=The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0-691-01046-5|page=33}}</ref>

He is also responsible for the career of [[Toshiro Mifune]].  In 1947, one of Mifune's friends who worked for the Photography Department of Toho Productions suggested Mifune try out for the Photography Department. He was accepted for a position as an assistant cameraman.  At this time, a large number of Toho actors, after a prolonged strike, had left to form their own company, Shin Toho. Toho then organized a "new faces" contest to find new talent. Mifune's friends submitted an application and photo, without his knowledge. He was accepted, along with 48 others (out of roughly 4000 applicants), and allowed to take a screen test for Kajiro Yamamoto. Instructed to mime anger, he drew from his wartime experiences. Yamamoto took a liking to Mifune, recommending him to director [[Senkichi Taniguchi]].{{cn|date=May 2013}}
