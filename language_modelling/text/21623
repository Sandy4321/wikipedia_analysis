The '''United Nations Children's Fund''' (or '''UNICEF'''; {{pronEng|yu<U+02D0>.n<U+0254><U+02D0>.s<U+025B>f}}, {{respell|yoo|nu|sef}}) was created by the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] on December 11, 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries that had been devastated by [[World War II]]. In 1953, UNICEF became a permanent part of the [[United Nations System]] and its name was shortened from the original '''United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund''' but it has continued to be known by the popular [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]] based on this old name. Headquartered in [[New York City]], UNICEF provides long-term [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and developmental assistance to [[child]]ren and [[mother]]s in [[Developing country|developing countries]]. 

UNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors and UNICEF's total income for 2006 was $2,781,000,000. Governments contribute two thirds of the organization's resources; private groups and some 6 million individuals contribute the rest through the National Committees. UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. UNICEF was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1965 and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] of Concord in 2006.

==Priorities==
{{copypaste}}

UNICEF is currently focused on five main priorities: Child Survival and Development, [[Basic education|Basic Education]] and [[Gender equality|Gender Equality]] (including [[Female education|girls' education]]), Child protection from violence, exploitation, and abuse, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] and children, and Policy advocacy and partnerships for children<U+2019>s rights. Related areas of UNICEF action include early childhood development, adolescence development and participation, life skills based education and child rights all over the world. 

UNICEF works to improve the status of their priorities through 14 methods{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} ranging from direct and legal interventions to education and beyond to research and census data collection.

===Education===
[[Education]] is a proven intervention for improving the lives of all people, including children. Educating young women yields spectacular benefits for the current and future generations, and specifically affects a range of UNICEF priorities including [[child survival]], children in family, [[immunization]], and child protection.
:''UNICEF<U+2019>s aim is to get more girls and boys into school, ensure that they stay in school and that they are equipped with the basic tools  they need to succeed in later life. As part of its on-going efforts to ensure every girl and boy their right to an education, UNICEF<U+2019>s acceleration strategy is speeding progress in girls<U+2019> and boys' enrollment in 25 selected countries during the 2002<U+2013>2005 period.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_21851.html UNICEF teams up with partners for girls<U+2019> education]</ref>

===Immunization plus===
Immunization is a direct intervention method which has made great improvements in the health of children worldwide over the past 20 years. But every year, more than 2 million children die from diseases that could have been prevented by inexpensive [[vaccine]]s.

The plus in the programme is the additional immunizations made possible during interventions. Ranging from client education to [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplements]] to [[insecticide]]-treated [[mosquito net]]ting, these life-saving services make immunization programmes a powerful tool for child health.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/immunization/index.html Immunization plus]</ref>

===Child protection and well-being===
UNICEF uses the term <U+2018>child protection<U+2019> to refer to preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and [[Child abuse|abuse against children]] and teens (both real and fictional children and teens)<ref>[http://kotaku.com/366737/unicef-campaigns-to-stop-virtual-child-porn]</ref> up to 18 yrs <U+2013> including commercial [[Commercial sexual exploitation of children|sexual exploitation]], [[Trafficking of children|trafficking]], [[child labor]] and harmful traditional practices, such as [[female genital cutting]]/mutilation and [[child marriage]]. UNICEF<U+2019>s child protection programmes also target children who are uniquely vulnerable to these abuses, such as when living without parental care, in conflict with the law and in armed conflict. Violations of the child<U+2019>s right to protection take place in every country and are massive, under-recognized and under-reported barriers to child survival and development, in addition to being human rights violations. Children subjected to violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect are at risk of death, poor physical and mental health, HIV/AIDS infection, educational problems, displacement, [[homelessness]], [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and poor [[parenting]] skills later in life.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/protection Child protection from violence, exploitation and abuse]</ref>

Among many other programmes, UNICEF supports the international [[Child Rights Information Network]]. In 2007, UNICEF published ''An Overview of child well-being in rich countries'', which showed the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the USA at the bottom of a league of 21 economically advanced nations when it comes to overall [[Child Development Index|child well-being]].<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/media/files/ChildPovertyReport.pdf An Overview of child well-being in rich countries]</ref>

UNICEF is also running several programs dedicated to controlling both online and off-line [[child pornography]].<ref> [http://www.unicef.org/aids/index.html HIV/AIDS and children]</ref> Unicef is also trying to criminalize virtual pornography (including adults posing as children, fictional works including underaged characters such as Romeo and Juliet).

===HIV/AIDS===
15 million children are now [[orphan]]ed due to AIDS. It is estimated that by the year 2010 in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] alone, more than 18 million children will have lost at least one parent to AIDS. Half of all new infections are people under the age of 26, with girls hit harder and younger than boys.

===Early childhood===
:''Every child must be ensured the best start in life <U+2013> their future, and indeed the future of their communities, nations and the whole world depends on it.''<ref> [http://www.unicef.org/earlychildhood/index.html Early Childhood]</ref> 

UNICEF applies a [[Holism|holistic]], evidence-based approach to early childhood, including the following principles:
*Preventive and curative health care including immunization, adequate nutrition, and safe water and basic sanitation must be provided as a ''[[sine qua non]]''.

==Structure of the organization and staff==
The heart of UNICEF's work is in the field, with staff in over 190 countries and territories. More than 120 country offices carry out UNICEF's mission through a unique program of cooperation developed with host governments. Seven regional offices guide their work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. 

Overall management and administration of the organization takes place at its headquarters in New York. UNICEF's Supply Division is based in [[Copenhagen]] and serves as the primary point of distribution for such essential items as lifesaving vaccines, [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral medicines]] for children and mothers with HIV, nutritional supplements, [[emergency shelter]]s, educational supplies, and more. Guiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is a 36-member Executive Board which establishes policies, approves programs and oversees administrative and financial plans. The Executive Board is made up of government representatives who are elected by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], usually for three-year terms.

Following the reaching of term limits by [[Executive director|Executive Director]] of UNICEF [[Carol Bellamy]], former [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Ann Veneman]] became executive director of the organization in May 2005 with an agenda to increase the organization's focus on the [[Millennium Development Goals]].

===UNICEF National Committees===

There are National Committees in 36 [[industrialised]] countries worldwide, each established as an independent local [[non-governmental organization]].  The National Committees serve as the public face and dedicated voice of UNICEF, raising funds from the private sector, promoting children<U+2019>s rights, and securing worldwide visibility for children threatened by poverty, disasters, armed conflict, abuse and exploitation.

UNICEF is funded exclusively by voluntary contributions, and the National Committees collectively raise around one-third of UNICEF's annual income. This comes through contributions from corporations, civil society organizations and more than 6 million individual donors worldwide. They also rally many different partners <U+2013> including the media, national and local government officials, NGOs, specialists such as doctors and lawyers, corporations, schools, young people and the general public <U+2013> on issues related to [[children<U+2019>s rights]].

(see [[List of UNICEF National Committees]])

==Promotion and fundraising==
In the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and some other countries, UNICEF is known for its "Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF" program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they [[trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]]  on [[Halloween]] night, sometimes instead of candy. UNICEF is present in 190 countries and territories around the world. UNICEF designated 1979 as the "Year of the Child", and many celebrities including [[David Gordon]], [[David Essex]], [[Alun Davies (guitarist)|Alun Davies]] and [[Cat Stevens]] gave a performance at a [[benefit concert]] celebrating the '''''Year of the Child Concert''''' in December 1979. Many people in [[Developed country|developed countries]] first hear about UNICEF's work through the activities of 37 National Committees for UNICEF. These [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGO) are primarily responsible for [[fundraising]], selling UNICEF greeting cards and products, creating private and public partnerships, advocating for children<U+2019>s rights, and providing other invaluable support. The [[U.S. Fund for UNICEF]] is the oldest of the National Committees, founded in 1947.<ref> [http://www.unicefusa.org/site/c.duLRI8O0H/b.25933/k.8DDD/US_Fund_for_UNICEF__US_Fund_for_UNICEF.htm US Fund for UNICEF]</ref>  New Zealand appointed, in 2005, 18-year-old [[Hayley Westenra]], a talented, world famous opera / pop singer as their Ambassador to UNICEF, in an effort to enlist the youth of the world in supporting UNICEF.  Westenra has made several trips to visit underprivileged children in third world countries on behalf of UNICEF, in an effort to publicize their plight, and has engaged in fund-raising activities in support of the UNICEF mission, as well.

===Sponsorship===
Recently, UNICEF has begun partnerships with world-class athletes and teams to promote the organization's work and to raise funds.

[[Image:Deco 21dec2006.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deco]] wearing the shirt with the Unicef logo.]]
On 7 September 2006, an agreement between UNICEF and the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[association football]] club [[FC Barcelona]] was reached whereby the club would donate 0.7% of its total yearly revenue to the organization for five years. As part of the agreement, FC Barcelona will wear the UNICEF [[logo]] on the front of their [[shirt]]s, which will be the first time a [[football club]] sponsored an organization rather than the other way around. It is also the first time in FC Barcelona's history that they have had another organization's name across the front of their [[shirt]]s.

In January 2007, UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada's national [[tent pegging]] team. The team was officially re-flagged as "UNICEF Team Canada", its riders wear UNICEF's logo in competition, and team members promote and raise funds for UNICEF's campaign against childhood HIV-AIDS.<ref>[http://www.maharaj.org/tentpegging.shtml UNICEF Team Canada]</ref>  When the team became the 2008 tent pegging world champions, UNICEF's flag was raised alongside the Canadian flag at the games, the first time in the history of international Grand Prix equestrian competition that a non-state flag has flown over the medal podium.<ref>[''Newstrack India'' "International Tent Pegging"], January 14, 2008</ref>

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] club [[Hammarby IF]] followed the Spanish and Canadian lead on 14 April 2007<ref>[http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/se/aktuellt/artiklar/<U+00E2>rticleid=30364 UNICEF, Hammarby strikes partnership (In Swedish)]</ref>, also raising funds for UNICEF and displaying the UNICEF name on their sportswear.  The Danish soccer club [[Br<U+00F8>ndby IF]] will do likewise from the summer of 2008.

Race driver [[Jacques Villeneuve]] has occasionally placed the UNICEF logo on the #27 [[Bill Davis Racing]] [[pickup truck]] in the [[NASCAR]] [[Craftsman Truck Series]].

The [[ING Renault F1 Team]] in [[Formula 1]] are also sponsored by UNICEF.

UNICEF recently announced a landmark partnership with Scotland's [[Rangers F.C.]] UNICEF will partner the Rangers Charity Foundation and have pledged to raise <U+00A3>300,000 by 2011.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail.asp?news_id=1205]</ref>

===Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box===
{{main | Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF}}
Since 1950 when a group of children in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], donated $17 they received on Halloween to help post-World War II victims, the '''Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box''' has become a tradition in [[North America]] during the haunting season. These small orange boxes are handed to children at schools and at various locations (such as [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] Gold Crown Stores) prior to 31 October. To date, the box has collected approximately $91 million dollars ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]) in Canada and over $132 million ([[United States dollar|USD]]) in the USA.

===Art in All of Us===
UNICEF sponsors the '''Art in All of Us'''<ref>[http://www.artinallofus.org Art in All of Us]</ref> initiative founded and organised by [[Anthony Asael]] ([[Belgium]]) and Stephanie Rabemiafara ([[Madagascar]]). The mission of Art in All of Us is to promote creative cultural exchange throughout the UN listed countries, using universal language of Art. The AiA World Art Book Program of Art in All of Us will present in one book each and every of the 192 UN-listed countries through a single portrait of a resident, a drawing and a poem done by a local child.

==Public criticism==
Many groups, governments, and individuals have criticized UNICEF over the years for what they view as failing to meet the needs of their particular group or interest. Recent examples include criticism of its perceived failure to hold the Government of [[Sudan]] adequately accountable for the practice of [[Slavery in Sudan|slavery in southern Sudan]]{{fact|date=April 2009}}, its policy against the marketing of [[breast milk]] substitutes in developing world hospitals{{fact|date=April 2009}}, and its adherence to the 1990 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which has been ratified by every member state in the United Nations except for the United States (which is a signatory to the convention) and [[Somalia]]{{fact|date=April 2009}}.

Unlike NGOs, UNICEF is an inter-governmental organization and thus is accountable to governments. This gives it unique reach and access in every country in the world, but may also sometimes hamper its ability to speak out publicly on rights violations, or to openly criticise the policies and actions of governments. 

UNICEF has also been criticised for having political bias by [[NGO Monitor]], an [[Israel]]i NGO with the stated aim of monitoring other non-governmental organizations operating in the [[Middle East]]. NGO Monitor asserts that while UNICEF aims to fund only non-political organisations, it also funded "[[Palestinian Youth Association for Leadership and Rights Activation]]" (PYALARA), a student-run Palestinian NGO. NGO Monitor alleges that PYALARA has a covert political agenda justifying [[Suicide attack|suicide bombings]] and demonising Israel.<ref>[http://www.ngo-monitor.org/editions/v1n05/v1n05-1.htm NGO Monitor Analysis (Vol. 1 No. 5) 11 March 2003]</ref>

The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] has also been critical of UNICEF, with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] at times withdrawing its donations, because of reports by the [[American Life League]] and others that UNICEF has used some of those funds to finance [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilizations]] and [[abortion]]s.{{fact|date=April 2009}} 

A further example is the emotive issue of [[International adoption|intercountry adoption]]s from [[Guatemala]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/crossing_continents/879859.stm Guatemala's baby business]</ref> The country has ratified the [[Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption]] of 29 May 1993 with effect from 1 January 2008. UNICEF has been criticised by some interested parties for failing to support adoptions that are underway before the deadline<ref>[http://www.jcics.org/Guatemala5000.htm The Guatemala 5000 Initiative]</ref> but, once again, this fails to recognise UNICEF's status and obligations as an international organisation, rather than an NGO.

==The UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre==
UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], was established in 1988 to strengthen the research capability of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and to support its advocacy for children worldwide. 

The Centre, formally known as the International Child Development Centre, has as its prime objectives to improve international understanding of the issues relating to children's rights, to promote economic policies that advance the cause of children, and to help facilitate the full implementation of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in industrialized and developing countries.

The programme for 2006-2008 was approved by UNICEF Executive Board in September 2005. It reaffirms the Centre's academic freedom and the focus of IRC's research on knowledge gaps, emerging questions and sensitive issues which are relevant to the realization of children's rights, in developing and industrialized countries. It capitalizes on IRC's role as an interface between UNICEF field experience, international experts, research networks and policy makers and is designed to strengthen the Centre's institutional collaboration with regional academic and policy institutions, pursuing the following four goals: 
*Generation and communication of strategic and influential knowledge on issues affecting children and the realization of their rights; 
*Knowledge exchange and brokering; 
*Support to UNICEF's advocacy, policy and programme development in support of the Millennium Agenda 
*Securing and strengthening the Centre's institutional and financial basis.

Three interrelated strategies will guide the achievement of these goals: 
*Evidence-based analysis drawing on quantitative and qualitative information, the application of appropriate methodologies, and the development of recommendations to assess and inform advocacy and policy action. 
*Enhanced partnerships with research and policy institutions and development actors, globally and at regional level, in developing and industrialized countries. 
*Communication and leveraging of research findings and recommendations to support policy development and advocacy initiatives through strategic dissemination of studies and contribution to relevant events and fora.<ref>[http://www.unicef-irc.org/ Innocenti Research Centre]</ref>
