When the New York City [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] created the Gramercy Park Historic District in 1966, they quoted from John B. Pine's 1921 book, ''The Story of Gramercy Park'':

<blockquote>The laying out of Gramercy Park represents one of the earliest attempts in this country at 'City Planning'. ... As a park given to the prospective owners of the land surrounding it and held in trust for those who made their homes around it, Gramercy Park is unique in this City, and perhaps in this country, and represents the only neighborhood, with possibly one exception, which has remained comparatively unchanged for eighty years -- the Park is one of the City's Landmarks.<ref name=lpc /></blockquote>

Calling it "a Victorian gentleman who has refused to die", Charlotte Devree in the ''[[New York Times]]'' said that "There is nothing else quite like Gramercy Park in the country."<ref>Devree, Charlotte.

==Boundaries==
Gramercy Park itself is located between East 20th Street, called Gramercy Park South at the park, and East 21st Street (Gramercy Park North) and between Gramercy Park West and Gramercy Park East, two mid-block streets which are between [[Park Avenue South]] and [[Third Avenue]].  [[Irving Place]] terminates at the southern end of Gramercy Park, and [[Lexington Avenue (Manhattan)|Lexington Avenue]], a major north-south thoroughfare on the East Side of Manhattan, commences at the northern.

The neighborhood's boundaries are roughly [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the south, [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] to the east, [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]] to the north, and [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue South]] to the west.<ref name=Thinking/> To the west of Gramercy Park is the [[Flatiron District, Manhattan|Flatiron District]] and [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], to the south [[Greenwich Village]] and the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], to the east are [[Stuyvesant Town]] and [[Peter Cooper Village]], and to the north are [[Rose Hill, Manhattan|Rose Hill]] on the northwest and [[Kips Bay, Manhattan|Kips Bay]] on the northeast.<ref>Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city.  (There are a number of [[Community Boards of Manhattan|Community Boards]], whose boundaries are officially set, but these are fairly large and generally contain a number of neighborhoods, and the [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neighbor/neigh.shtml neighborhood map] issued by the Department of City Planning only shows the largest ones.)  Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people.</ref>

The boundaries of the Historic District, set in 1966<ref name=lpc /> and extended in 1988,<ref name=lpcext /> are irregular, lying within the neighborhood, and can be seen in the map in the infobox on the right.  A proposed extension to the district would include more than 40 additional buildings on Gramercy Park East and North, Lexington Avenue, Park Avenue South, East 22nd and East 19th Streets, and Irving Place.<ref name=propext />

==Etymology==
"Gramercy" is an Anglicization of "Crommessie", which is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Krom Moerasje'', meaning "little crooked swamp",<ref name=encnyc>Jackson, Kenneth T. (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of New York City''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991.</ref> or ''Krom Mesja'', meaning "little crooked knife",<ref name=streetbook>Moscow, Henry. ''The Street Book''. New York: The Hagstrom Company, 1979, ''s.v.'' "Gramercy Park": "Crommessie, the Dutch for 'crooked little knife', which described the shape of a brook and hill on the site. Judith Stuyvesant, widow of Governor [[Peter Stuyvesant]] referred to "Cromessie" in a deed she signed in 1674."</ref> describing the shape of the swamp, brook and hill on the site.

==History==
The area which is now Gramercy Park was once in the middle of a [[swamp]]. In 1831 [[Samuel Bulkley Ruggles|Samuel B. Ruggles]], a developer and advocate of open space, proposed the idea for the park due to the northward growth of Manhattan. He bought the property, which was then a farm called "Gramercy Farm", from [[James Duane]], a descendant of [[Peter Stuyvesant]].<ref>Kugel, Seth. [http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_docid=1130CA9E904183A8&p_docnum=4&p_queryname=NaN&p_product=NewsBank&p_theme=aggregated4&p_nbid=T70N59BRMTE4NTg0NzQ0OS4yODY4NjU6MTo3OnJhLTE4ODg "The Ultimate Neighborhood Park"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 23, 2006.  Accessed July 30, 2007.</ref>  To develop the property, Ruggles spent $180,000 to landscape it, draining the swamp and causing about a million horsecart loads of earth to be moved.<ref name=gotham /><ref name=encnyc /> He then laid out "Gramercy Square", deeding possession of the square to the owners of the 60 parcels of land he had plotted to surround it, and sought tax-exempt status for the park, which the Board of Alderman granted in 1832.  It was the second private square created in the city, after [[Hudson Square]], also known as St. John's Park, which was laid out by the parish of [[Trinity Church]].<ref name=lpc />  Numbering of the lots began at #1 on the northwest corner, on Gramercy Park West, and continued counter-clockwise: south down Gramercy Park West, then west to east along Gramercy Park South (East 20th Street), north up Gramercy Park East, and finally east to west along Gramercy Park North (East 21st Street).<ref name=lpc />

Gramercy Park was enclosed by a fence in 1833, but construction on the surrounding lots did not begin until the 1840s.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06EFD71739E133A25750C0A9619C946095D6CF "Gramercy Park"], ''[[New York Times]]'', (July 3, 1921), editorial on the 90th anniversary of the dedication of Gramercy Park.</ref><ref name=gotham /> The first planting in the park was made in 1844.<ref name=lpc /> Ruggles also brought about the creation by the state legislature of Lexington Avenue and Irving Place,<ref>Ruggles named Irving Place after [[Washington Irving]], but Irving never lived there, although he frequently visited a nephew who lived nearby.</ref> two new north-south roads laid out between Third and Fourth Avenues and feeding into his development at the top and bottom of the park.<ref name=gotham />

[[File:Players Club.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Exterior of the [[Players' Club]], founded in 1888 by [[Edwin Booth]], at #16 Gramercy Park]]

In 1863, in an unprecedented gesture, Gramercy Park was opened to [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldiers involved in putting down the violent [[Draft Riots]] which broke out in New York, after [[conscription]] was introduced for the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=encnyc />  Some of the soldiers encampled in nearby [[Stuyvesant Square]].<ref name=gotham />

At #34 and #36 Gramercy Park (East) are two of New York's first apartment buildings, designed in 1883 and 1905.<ref name=access /> Elsewhere in the neighborhood, nineteenth century [[brownstone]]s and [[carriage house]]s abound, though the 1920s brought the onset of tenant [[apartment]]s and skyscrapers to the area.

In the center of the park is a statue of one of the area's most famous residents, [[Edwin Booth]], which was dedicated on November 13, 1918.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C07E3DC1239E13ABC4C52DFB7678383609EDE "Booth Statue Unveiled"] ''[[New York Times]]" (November 14, 1918)</ref><ref name=boothstat>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9D04E4DA113BEE3ABC4F52DFB7678383609EDE "Booth Statue in Gramercy Park"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (November 17, 1918)</ref><ref>[http://www.theatrehistory.com/american/booth002.html "New York Honors Edwin Booth"] ''Theatre Magazine'' (v.29 n.1, 1919)</ref> Booth was one of the great Shakespearean actors of 19th Century America, as well as the brother of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The mansion at #16 Gramercy Park (South) was purchased by Booth and renovated by [[Stanford White]] at his request to be the home of the [[Players' Club]], which Booth founded.  He turned over the deed to the building on New Year's Eve 1888.<ref name=boothstat /><ref name=access>Wurman, Richard Saul. ''Access: New York City''.

Tilden had steel doors and an escape tunnel to East 19th Street to protect himself from the sometimes violent politics of the day.<ref name=access />

In 1890 and 1912, attempts were made to run a [[cable car]] through the park to connect Irving Place to Lexington Avenue.<ref name=lpc />

In the late 19th century, numerous charitable institutions influential in setting social policy were located on 23rd Street, and some, such as the [[Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies]], still remain in the area. [[Calvary Church]] on Gramercy Park North has a food pantry that opens its doors once a week for one hour, and the Brotherhood Synagogue on Gramercy Park South served as an [[Underground Railroad]] station before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the building was a [[Quaker]] meeting house, established in 1859.<ref name=access />

On September 20, 1966, a part of the Gramercy Park neighborhood was designated an historic district,<ref name=lpc>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/GRAMERCY_PARK_HISTORIC_DISTRICT.pdf "Gramercy Park Historic District"] at the NYC [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] "Unlike any other district in New York, Gramercy Park, which was planned as a fashionable residential neighborhood, has always remained a fashionable residential neighborhood."</ref> the boundaries of which were extended on July 12, 1988.<ref name=lpcext>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/maps/gramercy_park.pdf "Gramercy Park Historic Distric and Extension"] map at nyc.gov</ref>  The district was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name="nris"/>  A proposed extension of the district would include nearby buildings such as the [[Manhattan Trade School for Girls]], now the [[School of the Future (New York City)|School of the Future]], and the Children's Court and Family Court buildings, now part of [[Baruch College]], all on East 22nd Street.<ref name=propext>[http://www.preserve2.org/gramercy/proposes/ext/ension.htm "Proposed Gramercy Park Historic District Extension"] on the Gramercy Neighborhood Associates website</ref>

In 1983, ''Fantasy Fountain'', a 4.5 ton bronze sculpture by [[Greg Wyatt]] was installed in the park.

One of the most significant [[steam explosion]]s in New York City occurred near Gramercy Park in 1989, killing two [[Consolidated Edison]] workers and one bystander, and causing damage of several million dollars to area buildings.<ref>Pitt, David E.

==Ownership of the park==
Gramercy Park is held in common as one of the city's two privately owned parks &ndash; [[Sunnyside Gardens]] in [[Queens]] is the other &ndash; by the owners of the surrounding structures, as it has been since December 31, 1831.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/NEIGHBORHOODS/sunnyside/sunnyside.html "Sunnyside"] on Forgotten NY</ref><ref>Vitullo-Martin, Julia.

In addition, members of the [[Players Club]] and the [[National Arts Club]] as well as  guests of the [[Gramercy Park Hotel]]<ref>[http://www.gramercyparkhotel.com/features.html Gramercy Park Hotel Features List Retrieved on July 3rd, 2007]</ref> have key access, as does Calvary Church.

The park was at one time opened to the public on Gramercy Day &ndash; which changed yearly, but was often the first Saturday in May. In [[2007]], the Trustees of Gramercy Park announced that it would no longer open the park on that day, though caroling in the park on Christmas Eve is expected to continue, but no longer connected to Calvary Church.<ref>[http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2007/05/gramercy_park_n_1.php "Gramercy Park no longer open first Saturday in May"] on NewYorkOlogy (May 2, 2007).</ref>

==The neighborhood==
Whether the neigborhood is called "Gramercy Park" or "Gramercy", it is generally considered to be a quiet and safe area.<ref name=Thinking /> While real estate in Manhattan is rarely stable, the apartments in the neighborhood around Gramercy Park have experienced little turmoil.  East 19th Street between Third Avenue and Irving is labeled "Block Beautiful" for its wide array of architecture and pristine aesthetic. [[Townhouse]]s with generous backyards and smaller apartments alike coincide in a collage of architecture in Gramercy Park. The largest private house in the neighborhood, a 42-room mansion on Gramercy Park South, sold for $7 million in 1993.

The quiet streets perpendicular to Irving Place have maintained their status as fashionable residential blocks reminiscent of London's [[West End of London|West End]]. In 1912, a multiple dwelling planned specifically for bachelors appeared at 52 Irving Place. This handsome [[Colonial Revival]] style structure with suites of rooms that lacked kitchen facilities was one of a small group of New York apartment houses planned for single men in the early years of the 20th century.

=== Gramercy Park Hotel ===
{{Main|Gramercy Park Hotel}}

The [[Gramercy Park Hotel]] was originally designed by Robert T. Lions and built by brothers Bing and Bing in 1925.  In 2006, the hotel underwent a massive makeover by hotelier [[Ian Schrager]] in association with the artist [[Julian Schnabel]]. The hotel has views of Gramercy Park, and guests receive keys to access the park during their stay. [[Humphrey Bogart]] married [[Helen Menken]] at the hotel in 1926.<ref>Bernard, Sarah.
