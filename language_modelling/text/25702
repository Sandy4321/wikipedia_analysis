'''Dauer Sportwagen GmbH''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[automobile|automotive]] company founded by former racing driver [[Jochen Dauer]] in [[Nuremberg]]. Initially founded as '''Jochen Dauer Racing''' in 1987, the [[auto racing|racing team]] had several years of participation in the German [[Supercup]] and European [[Interserie]] championships, as well as occasional runs in the [[World Sportscar Championship|World Sports-Prototype Championship]] and [[IMSA GT Championship|Camel GT Championships]] with the [[Porsche 962]]. Following the demise of [[sports prototype]] racing in the early 1990s, '''Dauer Racing GmbH''' was created to begin limited production of road cars, including a road-legal version of the 962, known as the [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]], which later went on to win the [[1994 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Once changing to Dauer Sportwagen, the company sold a continuation of the [[Bugatti EB110]].  

== History ==
=== Early racing ===
For several years, Jochen Dauer had run for a number of teams, mainly in the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft]] and its successor championship, the [[Supercup]].  Following the 1986 season, Jochen Dauer purchased a [[Porsche 962]]C, formerly belonging to the John Fitzpatrick team,<ref name="Chassis">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/chassis/chassis_porsche_962.html | title = Porsche 962 chassis numbers | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 27 May 2006 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref> as well as a [[Zakspeed]] C1/8.  Dauer was able to secure sponsorship from the [[Sirius Systems Technology|Victor Computer]] company, and confirmed a full-season campaign in the Supercup for the 962C,<ref name="Supercup 1987">{{citeweb | url = http://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/supercup/supercup1987.html | title = Supercup 1987 | publisher = World Sports Prototype Racing | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref> while the Zakspeed car would run in the [[Interserie]].<ref name="Interserie  1987">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/interserie1987.html | title = Interserie 1987 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>  Jochen Dauer was the sole driver of the machines in both championships.  Towards the end of 1987, Dauer also chose to enter the [[World Sportscar Championship|World Sports-Prototype Championship]], with [[Johnny Dumfries]] and [[Harald Grohs]] co-driving in the [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance events]].<ref name="WSPC 1987">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1987.html | title = FIA World Sports-Prototype Championship 1987 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>

Dauer Racing continued to run their old Zakspeed as well as another newly purchased Porsche in Supercup and Interserie into 1988, and earned their first victory in the Interserie event at [[Autodrom Most]], followed by a one-two victory at [[Zeltweg Airfield]] with [[Franz Konrad]] in the second entry.<ref name="Interserie 1988">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/interserie1988.html | title = FIA-Coupe d'Europe Interserie 1988 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>  Jochen Dauer won the Interserie drivers championship for the year.<ref name="Interserie">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/tableinterserie.html | title = Interserie - final positions and tables | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate= 2008-03-25}}</ref>

In 1989, Dauer Racing chose to concentrate fully on the World Championship and Supercup, only occasionally attending Interserie events. Franz Konrad remained as the co-driver initially, but was later replaced by [[Will Hoy]]. [[tic tac (candy)|Tic Tacs]] replaced Victor Computer as the team's primary sponsor. Dauer Racing struggled in the World Championship, finishing only one race in which they competed in.<ref name="WSPC 1989">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1989.html | title = FIA World Sports-Prototype Championship 1989 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref> In Supercup however, the team finished second in the championship behind the dominant [[Joest Racing]] squad,<ref name="Supercup 1989">{{citeweb | url = http://wspr-racing.com/wspr/results/supercup/tablesupercup.html | title = Supercup - final positions and tables | publisher = World Sports Prototype Racing | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref> although no victories were earned during the year, nor in the Interserie.

By 1990, the Supercup championship had been canceled.  Seeking new areas with which to race the team's 962s, Dauer entered a team in the [[IMSA GT Championship|Camel GT Championship]] in North America, while the European squad was merged with [[Konrad Motorsport]] for a joint entry in the World Championship.  Both squads struggled to complete races eventually withdrew from their respective championships before the year was completed.<ref name="WSPC 1990">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1990.html | title = FIA World Sports-Prototype Championship 1990 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref><ref name="IMSA 1990">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1990.html | title = International Motor Sport Association 1990 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2008-03-25}}</ref>  Strapped for cash, Dauer Racing made a last-ditch effort at the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991, entering two 962s.  One car was driven by [[Mario Andretti|Mario]], [[Michael Andretti|Michael]], and [[Jeff Andretti]] to a fifth place finish overall, while the other featured [[Al Unser|Al]], [[Al Unser, Jr.|Al Jr.]], [[Bobby Unser|Bobby]], and [[Robby Unser]], although it failed to finish.<ref name="IMSA 1991">{{citeweb | url = http://wsrp.ic.cz/imsa1991.html | title = International Motor Sport Association 1991 | publisher = World Sports Racing Prototypes | date = 2 October 2005 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>  After this, Dauer Racing withdrew from motorsport.

=== Converting 962s ===
{{main|Dauer 962 Le Mans}}
Shortly after Dauer Racing was closed, Jochen Dauer began work on converting a Porsche 962 so that it could be used by the public on the street.  Dauer Sportwagen was created from the remnants of Dauer Racing, and conversion of Porsche 962 chassis #169 began.  By the [[Frankfurt Auto Show]] of 1993, the first [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]] was completed and put on display.  [[Porsche]] assisted in providing numerous customer parts that had been developed for the 962, as well as assistance in developing new parts necessary to make the 962 legal for the streets.<ref name="962 Le Mans">{{citeweb | url = http://www.qv500.com/dauer962p1.php | title = Dauer 962 LM Part 1: 962 LM | publisher = QV500 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>  Once the first car was completed, Porsche approached Dauer about converting the next two chassis to race cars once again, in an attempt to re-enter the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] under the new production-based [[grand tourer]] regulations, rather than the 962's previous [[Group C]] class.  Running the Dauer 962s under a different class allowed it to use a larger fuel tank and a larger [[air restrictor]].<ref name="962 Sport">{{citeweb | url = http://www.qv500.com/dauer962p2.php | title = Dauer 962 LM Part 2: 962 LM Sport | publisher = QV500 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>

Successfully completed by June 1994, the next two chassis were entered by the factory Porsche team, running in a production-based classification thanks to new regulations.  Drivers [[Yannick Dalmas]], [[Hurley Haywood]], and [[Mauro Baldi]] won the race overall, while the second car finished in third place.<ref name="Le Mans">{{citeweb | url = http://www.formula2.net/1994.htm | title = 62th Grand Prix d'Endurance les 24 Heures du Mans 1994 | publisher = Le Mans Register | date = 20 November 2000 | accessdate = 2008-03-27}}</ref>  The following year the regulations were changed once again, and Dauer's 962s were not to race again.<ref name="962 Sport" />

Emphasis returned to production of the 962 Le Mans road cars.  Although only a couple were ordered each year, the cars continued to be sold for several more years.<ref name="962 Le Mans" />

=== Purchase of the remains of Bugatti ===
[[Image:BugattiEB110.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Dauer EB110 SS, featuring an unpainted [[carbon fiber]] body]]
{{main|Bugatti EB110}}
In 1995, [[Romano Artioli]]'s [[Bugatti|Bugatti Automobili SpA]] went bankrupt and the company was eventually liquidated.  During an auction held in 1997, Dauer Sportwagen bought most of the remains of the company, including spare parts and five unfinished [[Bugatti EB110|EB110]] chassis.  Dauer began immediate development and refinement of the EB110's design in hopes of continuing production.<ref name="Bugatti">{{citeweb | url = http://www.qv500.com/dauereb110.php | title = Dauer EB110 Part 1: EB110 SS | publisher = QV500 | accessdate = 2008-03-25}}</ref>

By 2001, Dauer had completed their alterations to the EB110s and offered the five chassis they had finished for sale.  The cars, based on the SS version of the EB110, re-added the [[four-wheel drive]] system that had been on the standard EB110 but not included on the original SS models.  The increased weight of the four-wheel drive was offset by new [[carbon fiber]] bodywork which was 200&nbsp;kg lighter than the standard bodywork.  The engines were remapped and power was increased to upwards of {{convert|705|bhp|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bugatti" />

== Current sales ==
Dauer Sportwagen continues to convert Porsche 962s for customers who can provide a used chassis. The company also sells parts for the Bugatti EB110, as well as the remaining EB110s the company converted.
