'''''Eraserhead''''' is a 1977 [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[body horror]] film written and directed by American filmmaker [[David Lynch]]. Shot in black-and-white, ''Eraserhead'' is Lynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film was produced through the [[American Film Institute]] (AFI) during the director's time studying there. The film stars [[Jack Nance]], [[Charlotte Stewart]], [[Jeanne Bates]], [[Judith Anna Roberts]], [[Laurel Near]], and [[Jack Fisk]]. It tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), a man left to care for his deformed child in a desolate industrial landscape. Throughout, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring both his child and the Lady in the Radiator (Near).

''Eraserhead'' spent several years in [[principal photography]] due to the difficulty of obtaining the necessary funds to complete the film, with donations from Fisk and his wife [[Sissy Spacek]] keeping production afloat. The film was shot on several locations owned by the AFI in [[California]], including [[Greystone Mansion]] and a set of disused stables in which Lynch lived. Lynch and sound designer [[Alan Splet]] spent a year working on the film's audio, following the fabrication of soundproofing for their own studio. ''Eraserhead''{{'s}} soundtrack features organ music by [[Fats Waller]], and includes the song "[[In Heaven]]", penned for the film by [[Peter Ivers]].

Initially opening to small audiences and little interest, ''Eraserhead'' gained popularity over several long runs as a [[midnight movie]]. Since its release, the film has earned positive reviews, with its surrealist imagery and sexual undercurrents being seen as its key thematic elements, and its sound design as its technical highlight. Thematic analysis of the film as also highlighted these issues, and has elaborated on Spencer's fatalism and inactivity as a character. In 2004, the film was preserved in the [[National Film Registry]], maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]]; it was also one of the subjects of the 2005 documentary ''[[Midnight Movies: From the Margin to the Mainstream]]''.

==Plot==

The Man in the Planet ([[Jack Fisk]]) is seen moving levers in his home in space; while the head of Henry Spencer ([[Jack Nance]]) is seen floating in the sky. A [[spermatozoon]]-like creature emerges from Spencer's mouth, floating into the void. 

In an industrial cityscape, Spencer walks home with his groceries. He is stopped outside his apartment by the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall ([[Judith Anna Roberts]]), who informs him that his girlfriend, Mary X ([[Charlotte Stewart]]), has invited him to dinner with her family. Spencer leaves his groceries in his apartment, which is filled with piles of dirt and dead vegetation. That night, Spencer visits X's home, conversing awkwardly with her mother ([[Jeanne Bates]]). At the dinner table, he is asked to carve a chicken which X's father (Allen Joseph) has "made"; the bird moves and writhes on the plate and gushes blood when cut. After dinner, Spencer is cornered by X's mother, who tries to kiss him. She tells him that X has had his child, and that the two must marry. X, however, is not sure what she has given birth to could even be called a child.

The couple move into Spencer's one-room apartment, and begin caring for the child<U+2014>a swaddled bundle with an inhuman, snakelike face, resembling the creature seen earlier. The infant refuses all food, and cries incessantly and intolerably. The sound drives X hysterical, and she leaves Spencer and the child. He attempts to care for it, finding that it struggles to breathe and develops painful sores. 

Spencer begins experiencing visions, once again seeing the Man in the Planet, as well at the Lady in the Radiator ([[Laurel Near]]), who sings to him as she stomps upon miniature replicas of Spencer's child. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has another vision, seeing his own head fall off, revealing a stump underneath which resembles the child's face. Spencer's head falls from the sky, landing on a street where it breaks open. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers. Spencer is then seen, as normal again, in a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. 

Spencer tries to seek out the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall again, but she has moved on, taking other men home. Crushed, Spencer returns to his room, where the child is once again crying. He takes a pair of scissors and for the first time removes the child's swaddling. Underneath it is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages were all that held its internal organs together, and they spill apart once the rags are cut open. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer stabs its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child's body. The power in the room overloads, causing the lights to flicker; as they flick on and off the child can be seen growing to huge proportions. As the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet seen at the beginning. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and [[white noise]] build to a crescendo before the screen turns black and silent.

Writer and director [[David Lynch]] had previously studied for a career as an artist, and had created several short films based on a desire to animate his paintings.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=192<U+2013>6}} However, by 1970, he had switched his focus to film-making, and at the age of 24 he accepted a scholarship at the [[American Film Institute]] Centre for Advanced Film Studies. Lynch disliked the course, and considered dropping out; only changing his mind when he was offered the chance to produce a script of his own devising. Lynch was given permission to use the school's full campus to provide film sets; he converted the disused stables into a series of sets and began to live there.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=27}} In addition, [[Greystone Mansion]], also owned by the AFI, was used for a large number of scenes.<ref name="dark lens">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/14/magazine/a-dark-lens-on-america.html?pagewanted=8&src=pm |title=A Dark Lens on America |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date= January 14, 1990 |first=Richard B. |last=Woodward |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref>

Lynch had initially begun work on a script titled ''Gardenback'', based on a painting he had completed of a hunched figure with vegetation growing from its back. ''Gardenback'' was a surrealist script about adultery, which featured an ever-growing insect representing one man's lust for his neighbor. ''Gardenback'' would have resulted in a roughly 45-minute-long film, which the AFI felt was too long for such a figurative, nonlinear script.{{sfn|Olson|2008|pp=56<U+2013>59}} In its place, Lynch presented ''Eraserhead'', which he had developed based on a daydream of a man's head being taken by a small boy to a pencil factory. Several board members at the AFI were still opposed to producing such a surrealist work, but were persuaded when dean [[Frank Daniel]] threatened to resign if it was vetoed.{{sfn|Olson|2008|pp=59<U+2013>60}} Lynch's script for ''Eraserhead'' was influenced by his reading as a film student; [[Franz Kafka]]'s 1915 novella ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' and [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s 1836 short story "[[The Nose (Gogol)|The Nose]]" were strong influences on the screenplay.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=54}}

The script is also thought to have been inspired by Lynch's fear of fatherhood;<ref name="dark lens"/> his daughter [[Jennifer Lynch|Jennifer]] had been born with "severely clubbed feet", requiring extensive corrective surgery as a child.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=87}} Jennifer has claimed that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=87}} The tone of the film was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in [[Philadelphia]]. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of "violence, hate and filth".{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=51}} The area in which the family lived was rife with crime, and inspired the bleak urban sprawl of ''Eraserhead''. Describing this period of his life, Lynch has said "'I saw so many things in Philadelphia I couldn't believe [...] I saw a grown woman grab her breasts and speak like a baby, complaining her nipples hurt. This kind of thing will set you back".<ref name="dark lens"/> Film critic Greg Olson, in his book ''David Lynch: Beautiful Dark'', posits that this time contrasted starkly with the director's childhood in the [[Pacific Northwest]] to give the director a "bipolar, Heaven-and-Hell vision of America" which has subsequently shaped his films.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=51}}

Initial casting for the film began in 1971, with Jack Nance being quickly selected for the lead role. However, the staff at the AFI had underestimated the scale of Lynch's project<U+2014>they had initially greenlit ''Eraserhead'' after viewing a twenty-one page screenplay, assuming that the film industry's usual ratio of one minute of film per scripted page would mean the film would end up being approximately twenty minutes long. This misunderstanding, coupled with Lynch's own meticulous direction, would cause the film to remain in production for a number of years.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=27}} In an extreme example of this labored schedule, one scene in the film begins with Nance's character opening a door<U+2014>a full year would pass before he could be filmed entering the room. Nance, however, was dedicated to producing the film, and retained the unorthodox hairstyle his character sported for the entirety of its gestation.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=27<U+2013>28}}

===Filming===

Buoyed with regular donations from Lynch's childhood friend Jack Fisk and his wife [[Sissy Spacek]], production continued for a number of years.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=28}} Additional funds were provided by Nance's wife [[Catherine E. Coulson]], who was working as a waitress and donating her wages and tips;{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=67}} and Lynch himself, who was working a paper route throughout the length of the film's principal photography.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=60}} However, during one of the many lulls in filming, Lynch was able to produce the short film ''[[The Short Films of David Lynch|The Amputee]]'', taking advantage of the AFI's wish to test new film stock before committing to bulk purchases.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=28<U+2013>29}} The short piece starred Coulson, who would continue working with Lynch as a technician on ''Eraserhead''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=28<U+2013>29}} ''Eraserhead''{{'s}} production crew was very small, composed of Lynch; [[sound design]]er [[Alan Splet]]; [[cinematography|cinematographer]] Herb Cardwell, who left during production and was replaced with [[Frederick Elmes]]; production manager and prop technician Doreen Small; and Coulson, who worked in a variety of roles.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=55}}

[[File:Eraserhead baby.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A screenshot of the film, showing the bizarre animal-like infant|It has been speculated that a rabbit may have been used to create Spencer's baby.]]

The physical effects used to create the deformed child have been kept secret. Lynch frequently blindfolded the projectionist who worked on the film's [[dailies]] to avoid revealing how the prop was created or operated, and has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|pp=242<U+2013>243}} The prop<U+2014>which Nance had nicknamed "Spike"<U+2014>featured several working parts, with its neck, eyes and mouth capable of being operated independently.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=35<U+2013>36}} Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that "it was born nearby" or "maybe it was found".{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=54}} It has been speculated that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb's fetus.<ref name="guardian baby">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/06/davidlynch |title=Film: David Lynch's film has scarred many an innocent viewer, including a teenage John Patterson |first=John |last=Patterson |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=September 6, 2008 |accessdate=August 24, 2012}}</ref> The child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as [[Joseph Merrick|John Merrick]]'s make-up in 1980's ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' and the [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]] of 1984's ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]''.<ref name="nyt rev"/>

During production, Lynch began experimenting with a technique of recording dialogue which had been spoken phonetically backwards, and reversing the resulting audio. Although the technique was ultimately not used in the film, Lynch would later return to it for "[[Episode 2 (Twin Peaks)|Episode 2]]", the third episode of his 1990 television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|pp=165<U+2013>167}} Jennifer Lynch has recalled growing up around the sets used for the film, adding that "''Eraserhead'' was my childhood".<ref name="jennifer">{{cite web |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/jennifer-lynch-on-david-lynch |title=Jennifer Lynch on David Lynch |publisher=[[Total Film]] |first1=Jennifer |last1=Lynch |authorlink1=Jennifer Lynch |first2=Sam |last2=Ashurst |date=March 3, 2009 |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Lynch began his interest in [[Transcendental Meditation]] during the film's production,<ref name="dark lens"/> adopting a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]] and giving up smoking and alcohol entirely.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=72}}

===Post-production===

Lynch worked with sound designer Alan Splet to create the film's sound. The pair designed and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The film's soundtrack is densely layered, with as many fifteen different sounds being played at once using multiple reels.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=234}} Sounds were created in a variety of ways<U+2014>for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub and recorded the sound of air being blow through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds would then be further augmented by altering their pitch, reverb and frequency.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|pp=234<U+2013>235}}

After a poorly-received [[test screening]], in which Lynch believes he had mixed the soundtrack at too high a volume, the director cut twenty minutes of footage from the film, bringing its length down to 89 minutes.{{sfn|Hoberman|Rosenbaum|1991|p=235}} Among the cut footage is a scene featuring Coulson as the infant's midwife, another of a man torturing two women<U+2014>one again played by Coulson<U+2014>with a car battery, and one of Spencer toying with a dead cat.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=34}}

==Themes==

''Eraserhead''{{'s}} sound design has been seen as one of its defining elements. Although the film features several hallmark visuals<U+2014>the deformed infant and the sprawling industrial setting<U+2014>these are matched by their accompanying sounds, with the "incessant mewling" and "evocative aural landscape" paired with these respectively.<ref name="scenic route">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/david-lynch-shows-how-audio-can-be-creepier-than-a,73926/ |title=David Lynch shows how audio can be creepier than any image in Eraserhead |publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]'' |first=Mike |last=D'Angelo |date=May 14, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> The film features several constantly-present industrial sounds, providing low-level background noise in every scene. The effect of this is to provide a "threatening" and "unnerving" atmosphere, which has since been imitated in works such as [[David Fincher]]'s 1995 thriller ''[[Seven (film)|Seven]]'' and the [[Coen brothers]]' 1991 comedy ''[[Barton Fink]]''.<ref name="scenic route"/> The constant low-level noise has been seen as perhaps being a product of Henry Spencer's imagination, with the soundtrack being "ruthlessly negligent of the difference between dream and reality".{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2012|p=182}} The film also begins a trend within Lynch's work of relating [[diegesis|diegetic]] music to dreams, with the Lady in the Radiator singing "In Heaven" during Spencer's extended dream sequence. This is also seen in "Episode 2" of ''Twin Peaks'', with diegetic music carrying over from a character's dream to his waking thoughts; and in 1986's ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'', with the focus given to [[Roy Orbison]]'s "[[In Dreams (song)|In Dreams]]".{{sfn|Wierzbicki|2012|p=182}}

The film has also been noted for its strong sexual themes. Opening with an image of conception, the film then portrays Henry Spencer as a character both terrified of, and fascinated by sex. The recurring images of sperm-like creatures, including the child, are a constant presence during the film's sex scenes; while the apparent "[[girl next door]]" appeal of the Lady in the Radiator is thrown aside during her musical number as she begins to violently smash Spencer's sperm creatures and aggressively meets his gaze.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=32}} David J. Skal, in his book ''The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror'', has described the film as "depict[ing] human reproduction as a desolate freak show, an occupation fit only for the damned". Skal also posits a different characterization of the Lady in the Radiator, describing her as "desperately eager for an unseen audience's approval".{{sfn|Skal|2001|p=298}} In his book ''David Lynch Decoded'', Mark Allyn Stewart proposes that the Lady in the Radiator is in fact Spencer's [[subconscious]], a manifestation of his own urge to kill his child, who embraces him after the deed as if to say he has done the right thing.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=7}}

As a character, Spencer has been seen as an [[everyman]] figure, his blank expression and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=62}} Spencer displays a [[pacifism|pacifistic]] and [[fatalism|fatalistic]] inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him without taking control for himself. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax, his apparent act of infanticide driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen as a precursor to Lynch's 1983<U+2013>1992 comic strip ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=33}}

Lynch would end up collaborating with most of the cast and crew of ''Eraserhead'' again on his later films. Frederick Elmes served as cinematographer on ''Blue Velvet'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=53}} 1988's ''The Cowboy and the Frenchman'', and 1990's ''[[Wild at Heart (film)|Wild at Heart]]'';{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=62<U+2013>63}} while Alan Splet provided sound design for ''The Elephant Man'', ''Dune'' and ''Blue Velvet''.<ref name="splet rovi">{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/alan-splet-p112354 |title=Alan Splet <U+2013> Move and Film Biography and Filmography |work=[[Allmovie]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Jack Fisk later directed episodes of Lynch's 1992 television series ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the Air]]'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=87}} and worked as a production designer on 2001's ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' and 1999's ''[[The Straight Story]]''.<ref name="fisk rovi">{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/name/jack-p89912 |title=Jack Fisk <U+2013> Move and Film Biography and Filmography |work=[[Allmovie]] |publisher=[[AllRovi]] |accessdate=August 22, 2012}}</ref> Coulson and Nance both appeared in ''Twin Peaks'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=69}} with Nance making further appearances in ''Dune'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=46}} ''Blue Velvet'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=53}} ''Wild at Heart'',{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=63}} and 1997's ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=95}}

Following the release of ''Eraserhead'', Lynch next attempted to find funding for his next project, ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'', a film "about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair".{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=91}} Lynch met film producer met [[Stuart Cornfeld]] during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed ''Eraserhead'' and was interested in producing ''Ronnie Rocket''; Cornfeld was working for [[Mel Brooks]] and [[List of Brooksfilms productions|Brooksfilms]] at the time, and when the two realized that ''Ronnie Rocket'' was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in, but on hearing the name of the first, the director decided his next project would be ''The Elephant Man''.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=92}}

''Eraserhead'' served as an influence on [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''; Kubrick reportedly screened the film for the cast and crew to "put them in the mood" he wanted to achieve for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/david-lynch/eraserhead-the-short-films-of-david-lynch-review|title=Eraserhead, The Short Films Of David Lynch|last=Roberts|first=Chris|work=uncut.co.uk|accessdate=August 26, 2012}}</ref> ''Eraserhead'' is also credited with influencing the 1990 Japanese cyberpunk film ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]'', the experimental 1990 horror film ''[[Begotten]]'' and [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s 1998 directorial debut ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]''.{{sfn|Harper|2007|p=140}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/movies/whats-the-big-deal-eraserhead-1977|title=What's the big deal?: Eraserhead (1977)|last=Snider|first=Eric D.|work=film.com|accessdate=August 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>Vaughan, Robin.
