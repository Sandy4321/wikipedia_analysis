'''Commerce Square''' is a high-rise office building complex in [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[USA]]. Commerce Square consists of One and Two Commerce Square, two identical 41-[[Storey|story]], {{convert|565|ft|m}} office towers that surround a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} paved courtyard. Architecturally, the granite towers feature [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] on the north and south sides of the building and are topped with a pair of stone diamonds with cutout squares in the center. The towers were built as part an office building boom Philadelphia was experiencing on [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|West Market Street]] in the late 1980s. Designed by IM Pei & Partners, now called [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], the towers were developed in a joint venture between Maguire Thomas Partners and [[IBM]]. IBM also leased more than half of One Commerce Square to be the company's [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]] headquarters. Construction of the first phase, which included One Commerce Square, the plaza and retail space, began in 1985 and was finished in 1987. The second phase of the project, Two Commerce Square, did not begin until a lead tenant was secured for the building in 1990. [[Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail) agreed to be Two Commerce Square's lead tenant and make the skyscraper its corporate headquarters after a two year search for office space in and around the city. Two Commerce Square officially ended the skyscraper construction boom of the 1980s when it was completed in 1992. No other office skyscraper was built in Philadelphia until the [[Cira Centre]] in 2005.

In the 1990s Commerce Square's lead tenants shrunk their presence dramatically in the towers. IBM moved some of its operations outside Philadelphia in the early 1990s and Conrail was bought by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]] later in the decade. Almost all of Conrail's operations were moved out of Philadelphia by the 2000s. The complex was praised mainly for its design of two towers surrounding a plaza. Renowned Philadelphia [[urban planner]] [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund N. Bacon]] praised Commerce Square and its plaza by saying it "will prove to be one of the finest commercial projects to be built in this century." ''[[The New York Times]]'' architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] described Commerce Square as "discreet" and the standing diamond shapes on top as "strange."

==History==
Commerce Square was part of an office building boom in the late 1980s that saw numerous skyscraper construction in the [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|West Market Street]] neighborhood of [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="nyt1">{{cite journal | quotes=no | first=David J. | last=Wallace | date=December 22, 1991 | title=Philadelphia; Biggest Lease Of '91 Signed | journal=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/22/realestate/northeast-notebook-philadelphia-biggest-lease-of-91-signed.html | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref> The $US300 million development of Commerce Square was led by Robert F. Maguire 3rd, co-managing partner of Maguire Thomas Partners of [[Los Angeles]]. With a design by IM Pei & Partners, now called [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], Maguire was able to bring in [[IBM]] as a joint partner in the development. IBM also served as the lead tenant for One Commerce Square, making about half the building its headquarters for the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic region]]. Commerce Square would be split between two buildings, with One Commerce Square being built first, and the second tower, Two Commerce Square, being built later once a lead tenant was secured. Plans for Commerce Square were officially announced on November 16, 1984 at a press conference at the [[The Bellevue-Stratford Hotel|Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]]. The first phase of the project included One Commerce Square, retail and restaurant space, a [[plaza]], and an underground parking garage. Construction began with the first phase of the project on June 10, 1985.<ref name="inky1">{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=March 31, 1985 | title=The Leader in the Great Office Race | pages=J01 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=November 17, 1984 | title=IBM and Developer Unveil Plan for Market St. Complex | pages=D08 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=June 9, 1985 | title=IBM to Start on Phila.'s Twin Towers | pages=K01 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> One Commerce Square was [[Topping out|topped off]] with a ceremony on June 6, 1986.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=June 6, 1986 | title=Philadelphia's Newest Tower as Owners Woo Tenants, Skyscraper is Topped Off | pages=D11 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> The skyscraper officially opened on October 23, 1987.<ref name="inky3">{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=October 23, 1987 | title=Party to Hail Opening of Commerce Square | pages=C09 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref>

In 1987 the [[Consolidated Rail Corporation]] (Conrail) began indicating it wanted to consolidate its offices spread out across Philadelphia into one office building. In May 1988, Conrail started seeking proposals from developers for a building to house its [[corporate headquarters]].<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=May 26, 1988 | title=Conrail Seeking New Home Phila., Suburbs Are Considered | pages=C01 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> On March 30, 1990, after being sought after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Conrail announced that it would be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=March 31, 1990 | title=Center City Site Selected by Conrail | pages=B05 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> With a lead tenant, construction of the identical tower was able to start in July 1990.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=July 22, 1990 | title=Raising Twins in Center City Phila.

After the office building boom of the 1980s, the 1990s saw an office glut resulting in numerous vacancies and lower leasing rates. In 1993 IBM was struggling and it was shrinking its workforce and consolidating its operations, moving some of its employees out of the city. IBM started with occupying nearly half of One Commerce Square, but by 1993 it was using only one-fifth of the building.<ref name="inky2">{{cite journal | quotes=no | first=David I. | last=Turner | date=July 23, 1993 | title=Office Vacancies at All-Time High in Philadelphia's Center City | journal=Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=May 19, 1993 | title=IBM Workforce Here to Shrink by 15 Pct. the Computer Firm is Reorganizing Customer Service.

After the split, Thomas Properties renegotiated [[mortgage]] financing of the Commerce Square towers. Thomas Properties Group successfully renegotiated the debt for Two Commerce Square with [[Bank of America]], but was unable to renegotiate the debt with One Commerce Square's prime mortgage holder, [[Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation|Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation]]. To move past the deadlock, Philadelphia Plaza Associates filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection]]. Thomas Properties Group is the parent company of Philadelphia Plaza Associates which owns Commerce Square.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Walsh | first=Thomas J. | coauthors=Peg Brickley | date=July 25, 1997 | title=Chapter 11 for One Commerce | journal=[[Philadelphia Business Journal]] |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/1997/07/28/story1.html | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

Philadelphia Plaza Associates emerged out of bankruptcy reorganization early in 1998, but the company still had to worry about filling the space that was going to be vacated by Conrail. In October 1996 Conrail was bought by [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation]]. The merger was completed in May 1998 and the former Conrail offices and employees began to be moved out of the building. In the merger deal, CSX Transportation absorbed Conrail's 15 year lease. CSX was responsible for paying the lease, but the {{convert|728000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of space was subleased, offsetting the cost. Between 1999 and 2000, as Conrail offices were phased out of the Two Commerce Square, Thomas Properties filled the newly vacated space with new tenants.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Walsh | first=Thomas J. | date=May 8, 1998 | title=Commerce Square area development planned | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/1998/05/11/story8.html | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref name="pbj1">{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Kostelni | first=Natalie | date=September 8, 2006 | title=Unforeseen circumstances tell the tale of Conrail's lease | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2006/09/11/story4.html?from_rss=1 | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

==Architecture==

The pale gray granite skyscrapers feature [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] on the north and south sides of the building, with the bottom floors containing {{convert|33000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} and the upper floors {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}.<ref name="peicobb" /> The floors feature a large amount of floor space, a design influenced by IBM needs in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=May 8, 1994 | title=The Legacy of a Broken Agreement | pages=N01 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> The two towers are topped with a pair of standing stone diamonds with cutout squares in the center.<ref name="nyt2">{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Goldberger | first=Paul | date=June 24, 1990 | title=Architecture View; Philadelphia Carves Out a New Skyline | journal=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/24/arts/architecture-view-philadelphia-carves-out-a-new-skyline.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

The two towers are separated by a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} paved courtyard.<ref name="peicobb" /> Tables and chairs are placed around a large pink granite circular fountain in the center of the plaza.<ref name="inky3" /><ref>{{cite book |last=McClelland |first=Jim |title=Fountains of Philadelphia |date=2005 |publisher=Stackpole Books |isbn=9780811731911 |pages=Pages 33 }}</ref> The plaza was designed by [[Laurie Olin]] of Hanna/Olin Ltd.<ref name="peicobb" /><ref name="Bacon">{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Bacon | first=Edmund N. | date=July 25, 1997 | title=A new light on Independence Mall | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/1997/07/28/editorial4.html | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref> Impressed by Commerce Square's open space, the Philadelphia's city planning commission included influences from Commerce Square in new building code governing open-space.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Lawrence | first=John F. | date=October 9, 1989 | title=Nice Profits From Better City Life | journal=Fortune |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/10/09/72557/index.htm | accessdate=2009-06-11 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5o0JUVEkJ |archivedate=2010-03-05}}</ref>

Commerce Center was praised for its design of two towers surrounding a plaza. ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' said "Its most positive aspect is that it avoids the developers' cliches of atriums and shopping malls and makes a real urban place. It expresses great confidence in Philadelphia, and even more important, in the whole idea of living in cities."<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | date=December 2, 1984 | title=An Imaginative Design Makes a Statement About Public Space | pages=B01 | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> Renowned Philadelphia [[urban planner]] [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund N.

Goldberger felt the diamonds with the cutouts on the top of the towers were strange, saying "They look like diamond-shaped ears, or perhaps handles."<ref name="nyt2" />

==Tenants==
One Commerce Square's main tenant is IBM which moved into the skyscraper when it opened in 1987. IBM started with occupying nearly half of One Commerce Square, but in the decades since, consolidation shrunk the company's presence in the building.<ref name="inky2" /> Other tenants in One Commerce Square include Stevens & Young LLP, [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]], Fiserv Securities Inc., Thorp Reed & Armstrong LLP and Delaware Investments which also leases office space in Two Commerce Square.<ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Roberts | first=Joshua | coauthors=Sharon Oliver | date=December 22, 2000 | title=Center City Office Buildings | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal }}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title=Thorp Reed & Armstrong's Two Philadelphia Offices Move to Common Location | date=June 4, 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Stone | first=Adam | date=October 10, 2008 | title=Best Office Lease/Urban | journal=Philadelphia Business Journal |url=http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2008/10/13/focus5.html?page=2 | accessdate=2009-06-11}}</ref>

When Two Commerce Square opened in 1992 the Consolidated Rail Corporation made {{convert|728000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of the tower its corporate headquarters. Since being bought by Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation, Conrail and CSX now share around {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} in the tower. Today Two Commerce Square has become a center of [[accounting]] and [[Management consulting|consulting]] firms. The largest is accounting and consulting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] which occupies {{convert|215000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. Occupying the tower since it opened in 1992, professional services firm [[Ernst & Young|Ernst & Young LLP]] leases {{convert|115000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} of the tower. Other related firms include Delaware Investments which leases {{convert|125000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} and [[Grant Thornton LLP]]. Other tenants also fill the tower, these include Leaf Financial Corporation, which leases the 14th and 15th floors, Reliance Standard Life Insurance Co. which leases {{convert|130000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} and engineering firm McCormick Taylor which leases {{convert|60000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}.<ref name="pbj1" /><ref>{{cite journal | quotes=no | last=Holcomb | first=Henry J. | date=November 14, 2003 | title=Ernst & Young Renews Lease at Philadelphia Office Tower | journal=The Philadelphia Inquirer }}</ref> In 2010 [[Wolters Kluwer]] moved into {{convert|75000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}} on the third and fourth floors.
