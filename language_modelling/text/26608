'''Neapolitan''' (autonym: ''nnapulitano''; {{lang-it|napoletano}}) is the language of southern continental Italy, including the city of [[Naples]]. It is named not after the city, but after the [[Kingdom of Naples]], which once covered most of this area and of which Naples was the capital. On October 14, 2008 a law by the Region of [[Campania]] stated that the Neapolitan language was to be protected.<ref name=denaro>[http://www.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=548026 "Tutela del dialetto, primo via libera al Ddl campano"] ("Bill to protect dialect green lighted") from ''Il Denaro'', economic journal of South Italy, 15 October 2008 Re Franceschiello. L'ultimo sovrano delle Due Sicilie</ref> It has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] as a language and a heritage. Neapolitan has had a significant influence on the intonation of [[Rioplatense Spanish]], of the [[Buenos Aires]] region of [[Argentina]].<ref>Colantoni, Laura, and Jorge Gurlekian.

==Distribution==

The Neapolitan dialects are distributed throughout most of continental [[southern Italy]], historically united during the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], specifically southern [[Lazio]] ([[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Lazio|Sora]] districts), southern [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]] (Naples), northern and central [[Apulia]], and northernmost [[Calabria]]. The dialects are part of a varied [[dialect continuum]], so the varieties in southern Lazio, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Lucania and Calabria can typically be recognizable as regional groups of dialects. In eastern Abruzzo and Lazio the dialects give way to [[Central Italian]] dialects such as [[Romanesco]]. In central Calabria and southern Puglia, the dialects give way to the [[Sicilian language]]. Largely due to massive southern Italian migration in the 20th century, there are also numbers of speakers in [[Italian diaspora]] communities in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]]. However, in the [[United States]] traditional Neapolitan has had considerable contact with English, and is significantly different from contemporary Neapolitan spoken in [[Naples]]. English words are often used in place of Neapolitan words, especially among second-generation speakers.

The following dialects constitute Neapolitan; numbers refer to the map:<ref>''[http://www.italica.rai.it/principali/lingua/bruni/mappe/flash/regionalok.htm Carta dei Dialetti d'Italia]'' (Mapping of dialects of Italy) by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, 1977 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref>

The southernmost regions of Italy<U+2014>most of Calabria and southern Apulia, as well as Sicily<U+2014>are home to [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] rather than Neapolitan.

==Classification==
Neapolitan is generally considered [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]]. There are notable differences among the various dialects, but they are all generally mutually intelligible. The language as a whole has often fallen victim to its status of "language without prestige"<ref>without source</ref> even if it was commonly used in the court during the kingdom of [[Bourbons]],<ref>''"Io sono Napolitano; nato tra voi, non ho respirato altr'aria, non ho veduti altri paesi, non conosco altro suolo, che il suolo natio. Tutte le mie affezioni sono dentro il Regno: i vostri costumi sono i miei costumi, la vostra lingua la mia lingua, le vostre ambizioni mie ambizioni."'' Transl.: "I'm Neapolitan; born among you, I've not breathed another air, I've not seen others countries, I don't know any  other ground that the native ground. All my affects are in the Kingdom: your costumes are my costumes, your language is my language, your ambitions my ambitions." Words of King [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Francesco II delle Due Sicilie]]. Campolieti, Giuseppe ''Re Franceschiello. L'ultimo sovrano delle Due Sicilie'', Mondatori, Italy, 2005 (in [[Italian language|Italian]])</ref> as well as boasting a rich literary tradition ([[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], etc.).

The [[Italian language]] and Neapolitan are of variable mutual comprehensibility, depending on factors both affective and linguistic. There are notable grammatical differences such as nouns in the neuter form and unique plural formation, and historical phonological developments that often obscure the cognacy of lexical items. Its evolution has been similar to that of Italian and other Romance languages from their roots in [[Latin#Pronunciation|Spoken Latin]]. It has also developed with a pre-Latin [[Oscan]] influence, which controversially purported to be noticeable in the pronunciation of the ''d'' sound as an ''r'' sound ([[rhotacism]]), but only when "d" is at the beginning of a word, or between two vowels (e.g.- "doje" or "duje" (two, respectively feminine and masculine form), pronounced, and often spelled, as "roje"/"ruje", ''ved<U+00E9>'' (to see), pronounced as "ver<U+00E9>", and often spelled so, same for ''cad<U+00E9>/car<U+00E9>'' (to fall), and ''Madonna/Maronna''). Some think {{Who|date=July 2010}} that the rhotacism is a more recent phenomenon, though.  Another purported [[Oscan]] influence (claimed by some {{By whom|date=July 2010}} to be more likely than the previous one) is historical assimilation of the consonant cluster /nd/ as /nn/, pronounced [n<U+02D0>] (this generally is reflected in spelling more consistently) (e.g.- "munno" ('world', compare to Italian "mondo"), "quanno" ('when', compare to Italian "quando"), etc.), along with the development of /mb/ as /mm/ (e.g.- ''tammuro'' (drum), cfr. Italian ''tamburo''), also consistently reflected in spelling. Other effects of the Oscan [[substratum]] are postulated too, although substratum claims are highly controversial.  In addition, the language was also affected by the [[Greek language]]. There have never been any successful attempts to standardize the language (e.g.- consulting three different dictionaries{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, one finds three different spellings for the word for tree, ''arbero'', ''arvero'' and ''<U+00E0>varo'').

Neapolitan has enjoyed a rich literary, musical and theatrical history (notably [[Giambattista Basile]], [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Salvatore di Giacomo]] and [[Tot<U+00F2>]]). Thanks to this heritage and the musical work of [[Renato Carosone]] in the 1950s, Neapolitan is still in use in popular music, even gaining national popularity in the songs of [[Pino Daniele]] and the [[Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare]].

The language has no official status within Italy and is not taught in schools. The [[Universit<U+00E0> Federico II]] in Naples offers (from 2003) courses in Campanian Dialectology at the faculty of Sociology, whose actual aim is not teaching students to speak the language, but studying its history, usage, literature and social role. There are also ongoing legislative attempts at the national level to have it recognized as an official [[minority language]] of Italy. It is however a recognized [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 639 [[Joint Advisory Committee]] language with the language code of ''nap''.

For comparison, [[The Lord's Prayer]] is here reproduced in the Neapolitan spoken in Naples and in a northern Calabrian dialect, in contrast with a variety of southern Calabrian (part of [[Sicilian language]]), [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Latin]].

==Alphabet and pronunciation==
The Neapolitan alphabet, like the [[Italian alphabet]], is almost the same as the English alphabet except that it consists of only 22 letters.  It does not contain ''k,'' ''w,'' ''x,'' or ''y'' even though these letters might be found in some foreign words.  The pronunciation guidelines that follow are based on pronunciation of American English and these values may or may not be applicable to British English.

All Romance languages are closely related. Although Neapolitan shares a high degree of its vocabulary with Italian, the official language of Italy, differences in pronunciation often make the connection unrecognizable to those without knowledge of Neapolitan. The most striking phonological difference is the Neapolitan weakening of unstressed vowels into [[schwa]] (''schwa'' is pronounced like the ''a'' in ''about'' or the ''u'' in ''upon''). However it is also possible (and quite common for some Neapolitans) to speak standard Italian with a "Neapolitan accent"; that is, by pronouncing un-stressed vowels as schwa but by otherwise using only entirely standard words and grammatical forms. This is not Neapolitan proper, but a mere difference in Italian pronunciation.

Therefore, while pronunciation presents the strongest barrier to comprehension, the grammar of Neapolitan is what sets it apart from Italian. In Neapolitan, for example, the gender and number of a word is expressed by a change in the accented vowel, whereas in Italian it is expressed by a change in the final vowel (e.g. ''l'''uo'''ngo'', ''l'''o'''nga''; Italian ''lung'''o''''', ''lung'''a'''''; masc. "long", fem. "long"). These and other morpho-syntactic differences distinguish the Neapolitan language from the Italian language and the Neapolitan accent.

===Vowels===
While there are only five graphic vowels in Neapolitan, phonetically, there are eight.  The vowels ''e'' and ''o'' can be either "[[Close vowel|closed]]" or "[[Open vowel|open]]" and the pronunciation is different for the two.  The grave accent (<U+00E0>, <U+00E8>, <U+00F2>) is used to denote open vowels, and the acute accent (<U+00E9>, <U+00ED>, <U+00F3>, <U+00FA>) is used to denote closed vowels.  However, accent marks are not used in the actual spelling of words except when they occur on the final syllable of a word, such as ''Tot<U+00F2>, arriv<U+00E0>,'' or ''pecch<U+00E9>'' and when they appear here in other positions it is only to demonstrate where the stress, or accent, falls in some words.

==Grammar==

===Definite articles===
The Neapolitan [[definite article]]s (corresponding to the English word "the") are ''La'' (feminine singular), ''Lo'' (masculine singular) and ''Li'' (plural for both), but in reality these forms will probably only be found in older literature (along with ''Lu'' and even ''El''), of which there is much to be found.  Modern Neapolitan uses, almost entirely, shortened forms of these articles which are:

Before a word beginning with a consonant:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| '''Masculine'''
| ''<U+2019>o''
| ''<U+2019>e''
|-
| '''Feminine'''
| ''<U+2019>a''
| ''<U+2019>e''
|-
| '''Neuter'''
| ''<U+2019>o''
| <U+2013>
|}

These definite articles are always pronounced distinctly.

Before a word beginning with a vowel:

''l<U+2019>'' or ''ll<U+2019>'' for both masculine and feminine; for both singular and plural.

Although both forms can be found, the ''ll<U+2019>'' form is by far the most common.

It is well to note that in Neapolitan the [[Grammatical gender|gender]] of a noun is not easily determined by the article, so other means must be used.  In the case of ''<U+2019>o'' which can be either masculine singular or neuter singular (there is no neuter plural in Neapolitan), when it is neuter the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, the name of a language in Neapolitan is always neuter, so if we see ''<U+2019>o nnapulitano'' we know it refers to the Neapolitan language, whereas ''<U+2019>o napulitano'' would refer to a Neapolitan man.

Likewise, since ''<U+2019>e'' can be either masculine plural or feminine plural, when it is feminine plural, the initial consonant of the noun is doubled.  As an example, let's consider ''<U+2019>a lista'' which in Neapolitan is feminine singular for "list."  In the plural it becomes ''<U+2019>e lliste''.

There can also be problems with nouns whose singular form ends in ''e''.  Since plural nouns usually end in ''e'' whether masculine or feminine, the masculine plural is often formed by orthographically changing the spelling.  As an example, let's consider the word ''guaglione'' (which means "boy", or "girl" in the feminine form):

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| '''Masculine'''
| ''<U+2019>o guaglione''
| ''<U+2019>e guagliune''
|-
| '''Feminine'''
| ''<U+2019>a guagliona''
| ''<U+2019>e gguaglione''
|}

More will be said about these orthographically changing nouns in the section on Neapolitan nouns.

A couple of notes about consonant doubling:

*Doubling is a function of the article (and certain other words), and these same words may be seen in other contexts without the consonant doubled.  More will be said about this in the section on consonant doubling.
*Doubling only occurs when the consonant is followed by a vowel.  If it is followed by another consonant, such as in the word ''spagnuolo (Spanish)'', no doubling occurs.

===Indefinite articles===
The Neapolitan indefinite articles, corresponding to the English "a" or "an", are presented in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
!
! Masculine
! Feminine
|-
| '''Before words beginning with a consonant'''
| ''nu''
| ''na''
|-
| '''Before words beginning with a vowel'''
| ''n<U+2019>''
| ''n<U+2019>''
|}

===Verbal conjugation===
In Neapolitan there are four finite modes: indicative, subjunctive, conditional and imperative, and three non-finite modes: infinitive, gerund and participle. Each mode has an active and a passive form. The only auxiliary verbs used in the active form is "Av<U+00E8>" (''en.'' "to have", ''it.'' "avere"). For example we have: ' '' Aggio'' stato a Nnapule ajere', as in the English 'I ''have'' been in Naples yesterday', but in the Italian ' ''Sono'' stato a Napoli ieri' (the verb ''to be'' is used).

===Doubled initial consonants===
In Neapolitan, many times the initial consonant of a word is doubled.  This is apparent both in written as well as spoken Neapolitan.
* All feminine plural nouns, when preceded by the feminine plural definite article, ''<U+2019>e,'' or by any feminine plural adjective, will have the initial consonant doubled.
* All neuter singular nouns, when preceded by the neuter singular definite article, ''<U+2019>o,'' or by a neuter singular adjective, will have the initial consonant doubled.
* In addition, other words also trigger this doubling.  Below is a list of words which trigger the doubling of the initial consonant of the word which follows.
Bear in mind, however, that when there is a pause after the "trigger" word, then the doubling does not occur (e.g. ''Tu s<U+00EE> gguaglione, [You are a boy]'' where ''s<U+00EE>'' is a "trigger" word causing doubling of the initial consonant in ''guaglione'' but in the phrase ''<U+2019>A do s<U+00EE>, guagli<U+00F2>? [Where are you from, boy?'' no doubling occurs).  It is also well to note that no doubling occurs when the initial consonant is followed by another consonant (e.g. ''<U+2019>o ttaliano [the Italian language], but <U+2019>o spagnuolo [the Spanish language], where ''<U+2019>o is the neuter definite article).

===Words which trigger doubling===
