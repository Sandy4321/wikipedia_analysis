'''Craig A. Kraft''' (born Craig Allan Kraft; born on 7 December 1949) is an [[United States|American]] [[Sculpture|sculptor]]. Over the course of his career, Kraft has gained national recognition for his [[neon]] light works, establishing him as one of the leading neon [[Sculpture|sculptors]] of today. In his earlier works, such as ''Seated/Unseated Woman'' and ''Light Figure Fragment,'' Kraft rendered [[sculpture]]s incorporating details in neon. Since [[2000]] the main focus of Kraft<U+2019>s art has been privately commissioned pieces, such as ''Connective Ascension'', and monumental [[public art]] works, such as ''Lightweb'' in Downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring, MD]], that are [[Abstract Art|abstract]] pieces made from rolled [[aluminum]] and neon tubing.

Kraft<U+2019>s [[sculpture]]s have been featured in over 120 [[Art exhibitions|exhibits]] throughout the [[United States]], including thirteen [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibitions]], and in various international art exhibitions. He has twice been featured as an [[artist]] at the International Sculpture Conference and has been a member of the faculty of the [http://residentassociates.org/ticketing/landing/studio-arts.aspx Smithsonian Institution Studio Arts Program] since [[1992]]. His work has been published in over 25 books, magazine articles, and newspaper articles.<ref>http://www.neonshop.com/neonweb/spiders/ckraft.html</ref> His work can be found in the [[Collection (museum)#Types|permanent collection]] of the [[Museum of Neon Art|Museum of Neon Art (MONA)]].

Craig Kraft is known for working from his [[Fire Station|firehouse]] [[studio]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. The firehouse, formerly [[Engine House No. 7 (Washington, D.C.)|Engine House No. 7]], is a historic property in Washington that boasts having been home to the first all-black fire company in the District.

==Artistic career==
===Early life and education/training===
Craig Kraft was born on December 7, 1949 in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames, IA]]. During college and graduate school, Kraft<U+2019>s interests laid primarily in the sciences. As a student at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Kraft received his B.S. in [[zoology]] in [[1971]], followed by an M.A. in [[Environmental Education|Environmental Education and Science]] in [[1974]]. It was not until two years after he finished his master's degree that Kraft began developing his skills as a [[visual art]]ist. In [[1976]] Kraft moved to [[New Orleans|New Orleans, LA]], and started to model, cast, and paint the [[Figurative art|figure]] in [[clay]]. Neon was not included as a medium in his works until [[1983]] when Kraft began attending classes at the newly opened American School of Neon in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, MN]], which taught working with neon not as a commercial tool but as a means of artistic expression. In [[1989]] he studied at the [[Atlantic Center for the Arts]] in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida|New Smyrna Beach, FL]], with [http://www.stephenantonakos.com/ Stephen Antonakos], whom Kraft still considers one of his major influences.<ref name="Kraft, Craig 2009">Kraft, Craig. Interview by Jacqueline Temkin. October 22, 2009.</ref>

===Philosophy===
Craig Kraft<U+2019>s [[philosophy]] towards making art lies in his belief that a piece of art must work synergistically with its site; [[art]] and [[architecture]] must function together in harmony. He believes that an [[artist]] must consider the site the same way in which he views the art, for every place he puts an object affects how others view it just as much as the appearance of the object itself. As such, art must grow organically from the site, incorporating the different elements of the architecture aesthetically as well as culturally.<ref>Ross Putman. <U+201C>Craig Kraft: Neon Artist.<U+201D> Available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_rP-HlVDaA.</ref> In his own words, Kraft is <U+201C>inspired by the site in public art and by close examination of form, color, and light in general. Works are made from scratch<U+2014>little preconceived notions about the final outcomes. [I work with] one decision leading to another, always looking ahead as to how all the media (the aluminum, the neon, and the surroundings) work together as a whole.<U+201D><ref name="Kraft, Craig 2009"/>

===Teaching===
After spending a nearly a decade learning to use neon in the service of [[art]], Kraft began to spend some of his time [[Teacher|teaching]] others the craft of neon. While many artists resist sharing their specific (and often secret) techniques to others, Kraft has always enjoyed teaching eager students the skills and perspectives that he has gained over the years.<ref name="Kraft, Craig 2009"/> Since 1992 Kraft has been a member of the faculty of the [http://residentassociates.org/ticketing/landing/studio-arts.aspx Smithsonian Institution Studio Arts Program] and has offered private neon [[workshop]]s at his studio.<ref>Mondello, Bob. "Kraftwork." ''Washington City Paper''.</ref>

===Artistic style===
Craig Kraft<U+2019>s work is best described as [[Abstract Art|abstract]] in style with references to the [[Figurative art|figure]] and to [[nature]] in general. While some believe that his greatest influences are <U+201C>the illuminated works of [http://www.corkmarcheschi.com/ Cork Marcheschi], [http://www.stephenantonakos.com/ Stephen Antonakos], [[Dan Flavin]], and [[Keith Sonnier]],<U+201D><ref name="ReferenceA"><U+201C>Commissions: Craig Kraft.<U+201D> ''Sculpture: A Publication of the International Sculpture Center'', 23(8), 25.</ref> Kraft believes that the real impetus for his work is the unique desire and structural challenge to fully integrate architecture with art.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

==Works==
===Early works===
In the beginning of his career, Kraft worked with modeling the [[Figurative art|figure]] in [[clay]], using traditional methods and traditional subjects. But, by the early [[1980s]] he began to find his work becoming monotonous, and looked towards the newly opened American School of Neon in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, MN]] for inspiration. The [[philosophy]] of the school was to treat neon as a [[Sculpture|sculptural]] medium rather than merely a medium for [[Neon sign|commercial signage]]. Kraft was able to manipulate the neon in order to integrate it with his fragmented, sequenced [[Figurative art|figurative]] work. The colored lights added a certain volume, experience, and mood to the work that Kraft found previously lacking.

Many of these early works feature sections of [[Orthopedic cast|plaster casts]] of models attached to [[canvas]], backlit with neon. Kraft enjoyed <U+201C>the personal aspect of [[Orthopedic cast#Body casts|body casting]], and the shared beauty of the certain aspect of the human form and condition.<U+201D><ref name="Kraft, Craig 2009"/> The neon tubing is often concealed in his [[sculpture]]s, either by hiding the tube within the cast or by painting the tube black and scratching out sections of paint to direct the flow of light onto the [[Figurative art|figures]], giving the [[sculpture]] the appearance of a mysterious colored glow. Of Kraft<U+2019>s early work, <U+201C>a common theme<U+2026>a theme that immediately holds a peruser<U+2019>s eyes hostage<U+2014>is the seemingly partial emergence of a [[Figurative art|human figure]] from the canvas, made all the more captivating by the strategically placed neon backlighting that appears to serve as the portal for the [[Relief|bas-relief]] segment of the work.<U+201D><ref>Murray, Barbara. <U+201C>Art Beyond the Smithsonian: Unique Galleries and Museums Thrive in D.C.<U+201D> Art Business News, July, 2005.</ref>

Kraft is currently <U+201C>one of only a handful of light artists in the world who bends his own glass and is respected for his ability to precisely manipulate the [[Figurative art|figure]] and light to capture his own artistic vision.<U+201D><ref>http://www.midcityartists.com/artistdetails.asp?artist=craigkraft</ref>

===Public art===

When asked why he began to work in large-scale [[public art]] by [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]] local news reporter [[Holly Morris (Television Reporter)|Holly Morris]], Kraft responded that he wanted to be able to [[draw]] on buildings with neon, and that when drawing in space with light one needs to be able to work much larger.<ref name="Kraft, Craig 2008">Kraft, Craig. Interview by Holly Hunter. WTTG Fox 5 News. May, 2008.</ref> Many of his [[public art]] pieces appear to do just this. ''Lightweb'', arguably Kraft's most famous work, installed on an external [[elevator]] in downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring, MD]], features green, red, and blue colored tubes that extend from its architectural base into the air to create a 35' by 10' by 10' light drawing in the night sky. ''Lightweb'' was commissioned by the local [[Montgomery County, Maryland#Law and government|Montgomery County Government]] in 2003.<ref>http://www.silverspringdowntown.com/go/lightweb</ref>

Kraft's combination of rolled aluminum tubing and neon functions well for an outdoor setting, for he is able to use the aluminum to protect the neon's wiring from the elements, whether these pieces are attached to buildings or are freestanding.<ref name="Kraft, Craig 2008"/> Some critics have questioned whether neon, a material traditionally associated with [[night]]time viewing, functions well for [[public art]] viewed during the [[daytime]]. However other art critics believe that Kraft<U+2019>s most recent neon works, which incorporate aluminum tubes painted in a vibrant [[powder coating]], appear just as bold during the [[daytime]] as during the [[night]].
