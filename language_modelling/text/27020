== St. Jude Malankara Catholic Church==

In 1982, during the first visit of His Grace, the Most Rev. Archbishop [[Benedict Mar Gregorios]] to [[Philadelphia]], a [[prayer group]] consisting of 12 families was established.

== History ==

The Nineteen sixty<U+2019>s provided a time of great opportunity and prosperity for Indians. The changes in the immigration laws of the United States of America, paved the way for many Indians to migrate to this great nation of freedom and opportunity. Thus, during the early seventies, many Malankara Catholics began to migrate to the USA and settle in different parts of the country. Many of them choose Philadelphia-<U+201D>The City of Brotherly Love<U+201D> <U+2013> as their future home town.
The early Malankara Immigrants prospered in the land of their choice, but they greatly yearned for the Malankara Liturgical Service, which was the center and the sustenance of their spiritual life in India.
Their long cherished dream of the Malankara Community came true when His Grace the Most Rev. Benedic Mar Gregorios OIC, the Archbishop of Trivandrum and the head of the Malankara Catholic Hierarchy visited United Stare of America and Canada in the month of August, 1982 and established prayer groups in major cities of this country. Since then, in Philadelphia, regular prayer meetings were held at the residence of members and Holy Masses were celebrated as and when Malankara priests were available.
The presence of Rev. Ignatius Thangalathil OIC, a Malankara missionary priest who was on special assignment in New York, was the driving force in the formation of a Malankara Community in early 1983.
The subsequent visits of the Archbishop in 1993 and 1994 helped the community to say strong and united. Then Inauguration of the Malankara Catholic Mission of North America in New York in 1984, gave new hope and aspiration of all Malankarites in the United States in general and Philadelphia in particular.
In March 1985, Archbishop Mar Gregorios, in consultation with His Eminence John Cardinal Krol, Archbishop of Philadelphia, appointed Rev. Fr. John Kalloor to minister the spiritual needs of the Malankarites in Philadelphia and Washington. Under the guidance of Fr. Kalloor, the Malankara Catholic Community in Philadelphia blossomed and took over the shape of a full fledged parish, with regularly scheduled Malankara Liturgy celebrated at Incarnation of Our Lord Church. While organizing the community, Fr. Kalloor initiated the Malankara Catholic Youth Movement (MCYM), which became the corner stone of building of the parish.
Rev. Fr. Varghese Edithil, the successor of Fr. Kalloor, took charge of the community on March 30, 1987. He served as an associate pastor of the Incarnation and spiritual director of the Malankara faithful. Under his leadership, Malankara Children<U+2019>s League was inaugurated for the benefit and convenience of our youngsters, and religious instruction classes were initiated to provid a strong moral background, rooted in strong Malankara faith.
The timely paternal visit of Mar Gregorios, was the lifeline of the community. At the urging of Mar Gregorios, His Eminence Anthony Cardinal J. Bevilacqua, Archbishop of Philadelphia, officially established the Malankara Catholic Mission of Philadelphia on May 2, 1988.
Fr. Alexander Panamkunil was the successor of Fr. Varghese and took charge as the Associate pastor of Incarnation and spiritual director of Malankara Catholics in October 1991. Fr. Alexander tirelessly worked for the spiritual growth and unity of the community.
The community was blessed by the gracious visit of His Excellency The Most Reverend Geevarghese Mar Timotheos, Bishop of Thiruvalla. His visits promoted a sense of family ties with the mother church in India.
The visit of His Grace Most Revered Cyril Mar Baselious OIC, was an auspicious and joyful occasion.
In April 1995, Rev. John Kalloor succeeded Fr. Alexander as the parochial vicar of Incarnation church and spiritual director of the Malankara Catholic Mission. Today, under his dynamic leadership, the community feels a new sense of togetherness and unity.
Two family conferences of the Malankaraites of the Eastern regions, (New York, New Jersey, Washington and Philadelphia) were conducted at Philadelphia (1993, 1995), to promote unity and solidarity among Malankarites, and to discuss and evaluate issues pertaining to our life in this country and to find practical solutions to our individual needs. The second Family conference was lead and directed by His Excellency Mar Thimotheos.
Today the Malankara Catholic Mission of Philadelphia Consists of 75 families with 300 members.
Holy Qurbana is celebrated on all Sundays of every month, and Prayer Meetings are conducted on every first Sunday of the month at the residence of the members. Malankara  Mass in English is celebrated on every 1st and 3rd Sunday for the benefit of the youngsters.
An active MCYM is functioning in the mission, assisting the Vicar in the spiritual and temporal needs of the mission.
In order to form a Catholic conscience and practice, Sunday School classes are held after every Sunday Mass.
A strong YMCL (Young Malankara Catholic League) <U+2013> consisting of 38 youngsters between the ages of 7-20, is the back bone of the church activities. This was later discontinued and was merged with Sunday School.
The next generation of Alter Servers have been well trained to carry on the fine traditions according to the Malankara Liturgy. Each altar boy takes turn in serving at the altar with great joy and reverence.
Every Sunday afternoon, boys, girls, and all members who are young at heart, gather at the Incarnation Gym, to play basketball, volleyball, and other activities of their choice.
As fare as Philadelphia Malankara Parish is concerned, church is not only a place of worship, but is the center of all religious, social and cultural activities. The community is formed in and around the Incarnation of Our Lord Church, and Chor-Bishop Fr. John Kalloor is the nucleus of the activities.
The Malankara Catholic Mission of Philadelphia is ever grateful to His Grace the Most Reverend Benedict Mar Gregorios, <U+2013> the late Archbishop, His Eminence Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua, Most Reverend Geevarghese Mar Thimotheos, <U+2013> the pastor of Incarnation of Our Lord Church, Rev. Tom Betts <U+2013> Coordinator of Migrant in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and the Malankara priests and lay leaders for their care and support in the growth of the mission.
