'''Uranium-235''' is an [[isotope]] of [[uranium]] that differs from the element's other common isotope, [[uranium-238]], by its ability to cause a rapidly expanding [[nuclear fission|fission]] [[chain reaction]], i.e., it is [[fissile]]. In fact, U-235 is the only fissile isotope found in any economic quantity in nature. It was discovered in [[1935]] by [[Arthur Jeffrey Dempster]].

If at least one [[neutron]] from U-235 fission strikes another nucleus and causes it to fission, then the chain reaction will continue. If the reaction will sustain itself, it is said to be [[critical]], and the mass of U-235 required to produce the critical condition is said to be a [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]]. A critical chain reaction can be achieved at low concentrations of U-235 if the neutrons from fission are [[neutron moderator|moderated]] to lower their speed, since the probability for fission with [[Thermal neutron|slow neutrons]] is greater. A fission chain reaction produces intermediate [[Fission product|mass fragments]] which are highly [[radioactive]] and produce further energy by their [[radioactive decay]]. Some of them produce neutrons, called [[delayed neutron]]s, which contribute to the fission chain reaction. In [[nuclear reactor]]s, the reaction is slowed down by the addition of [[control rods]] which are made of [[chemical element|element]]s such as [[boron]], [[cadmium]], and [[hafnium]] which can absorb a large number of neutrons. In [[nuclear bomb]]s, the reaction is uncontrolled and the large amount of [[energy]] released creates a [[nuclear explosion]].

The fission of one atom of U-235 generates 200 [[Electronvolt|MeV]] = 3.2 &times; 10<sup>-11</sup> J, i.e. 18 TJ/[[mole (unit)|mol]] = 77 TJ/kg.  However, approximately 5% of this energy is carried away by virtually undetectable neutrinos. [http://www.tpub.com/content/doe/h1019v1/css/h1019v1_85.htm]

Only around 0.72% of all [[natural uranium]] is uranium-235, the rest being mostly [[uranium-238]]. This concentration is insufficient for a self sustaining reaction in a [[light water reactor]]; [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]], which just means separating out the uranium-238, must take place to get a usable concentration of uranium-235. [[Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor]]s, other [[heavy water reactor]]s, and some graphite moderated reactors are known for using unenriched uranium. Uranium which has been processed to boost its uranium-235 proportion is known as [[enriched uranium]], different applications require unique levels of enrichment.

The fissile uranium in [[nuclear weapon]]s usually contains 85% or more of <sup>235</sup>U known as '''weapon(s)-grade''', though for a crude, inefficient weapon 20% is sufficient (called '''weapon(s)-usable'''); even less is sufficient, but then the [[Critical mass (nuclear)|critical mass]] required rapidly increases. However, judicious use of implosion and [[neutron reflector]]s can enable construction of a weapon from a quantity of uranium below the usual critical mass for its level of enrichment, though this would likely only be possible in a country which already had extensive experience in developing nuclear weapons. The [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb was fueled by enriched uranium. Most modern nuclear arsenals use [[plutonium]] as the fissile component, however U-235 devices remain a [[nuclear proliferation]] concern due to the [[nuclear weapons design|simplicity of the design]].

Uranium-235 has a [[half-life]] of 700 million years.
