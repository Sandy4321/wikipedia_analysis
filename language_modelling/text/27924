Tinsley's profile at the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] describes him this way: "Tinsley was a magnificent athletic specimen, standing 6-0, and weighing 196-pounds, size he used equally well as a defensive stalwart who was a blocking master."<ref name=CFHOF>{{cite web|title=Gaynell Tinsley|publisher=College Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.collegefootball.org/famersearch.php?id=30044}}</ref>  As a sophomore in 1934, Tinsley had a 65-yard pass reception (thrown by halfback Abe Mickal) against [[Southern Methodist University]], which stood as a record for several years as "the longest pass in Southern football history."<ref name=CFHOF/>  Tinsley's coach at LSU, [[Bernie Moore]], once said, "Tinsley could have made All-American at any position.  He was so tough, he made blockers quit.  He's the greatest lineman I ever saw."<ref name=Obit/>

Tinsley concluded his college career by playing in an annual game between the college all-stars and an NFL team.  Tinsley scored the only points of the game on a 47-yard touchdown pass from [[Sammy Baugh]], as the college players defeated the [[Green Bay Packers]], 6-0.<ref name=Obit/>  

In 1993, LSU selected its all-time team as part of the celebration of the centennial of LSU football.  Tinsley was "the only unanimous choice" for LSU's "Early Years Team of the Century."<ref name=Obit/>  Upon his death in 2002, LSU Sports described his contributions to the school's football teams of the mid-1930s as follows:<blockquote>"Tinsley is widely considered to be among the finest athletes to ever play at LSU.  The star end led the Tigers to their first two SEC titles and played in two Sugar Bowls. He earned All-SEC and All-American honors in 1935-36 for his ability to dominate a game on both sides of the ball. In 1936, he was also second in balloting for national MVP honors. ...  At 6-3, 215 pounds, Tinsley was considered to the prototype end of his era because of his mobility."<ref name=Obit/></blockquote>

==Professional football player==
Tinsley was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals as the 12th overall pick in the [[1937 NFL Draft]].  He played of the Cardinals for three years in 1937, 1938 and 1940.  As a rookie in 1937, Tinsley set an NFL record with 675 receiving yards,<ref name=Obit/> and had the longest reception in the NFL at 97 yards.<ref name=PFR/>  He also ranked among the NFL's 1937 leaders in several categories, including 36 receptions (2nd in the NFL), 675 receiving yards (1st in the NFL), 677 total yards from scrimmage (2nd in the NFL), five receiving touchdowns (2nd in the NFL), 18.8 yards per reception (1st in the NFL) and 61.4 receiving yards per game (1st in the NFL).<ref name=PFR>{{cite web|title=Gaynell Tinsley|publisher=pro-football-reference.com|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/T/TinsGa20.htm}}</ref>   At the end of the 1937 season, Tinsley was selected as a first-team all-NFL player by the United Press, the NFL, the New York Daily News, and Collyers Eye Magazine.<ref name=PFR/>

In 1938, Tinsley continued as one of the league's top receivers, and he was selected as a first-team NFL 1938 All-Pro player.  His 41 receptions in 1938 tied the all-time NFL single-season record, and he once again had the longest pass reception in the 1938 NFL season at 98 yards.<ref name=PFR/> He also ranked among the 1938 league leaders with 516 receiving yards (2nd in the NFL) and 46.9 yards per game (4th in the NFL).  He was selected again selected as a first-team all-NFL player, this time receiving the honor from the Pro Football Writers, the NFL and Collyers Eye Magazine.<ref name=PFR/> 

When Tinsley retired, he ranked fourth in NFL history in pass receptions, despite having played only three seasons of professional football.<ref name=Obit/>

==Coaching career== 
After service in the [[U.S. Navy]], Tinsley worked as a high school football coach in [[Haynesville, Louisiana]].<ref name=Obit/>  He then served as an assistant football coach at LSU through the 1947 season.  In 1948, LSU's long-time football coach, Bernie Moore, retired, and Tinsley was hired to replace his former mentor.  In 1949, Tinseley's team finished the regular season 8-2 and played in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma.<ref name=Obit/>  Tinsley's LSU teams never met with the same success they had achieved in 1949.  In seven years as head coach at LSU, Tinsley's teams compiled a record of 35-34-6.<ref name=Fired>{{cite news|title=LSU Shakes Up Athletic Department: Head Grid Coach Tinsley Fired|publisher=Council Bluffs Nonpareil|date=1955-02-06}}</ref>  Displeased with the team's performance, the LSU board of supervisors in February 1955 fired Tinsley, though they agreed to pay his salary of $12,500 per year for the two remaining years on his contract.<ref name=Fired/>  After the vote to remove him, Tinsley said, "I have not made any future plans as yet, but I do know that I will continue to help LSU whenever and wherever I can."<ref name=Fired/>
