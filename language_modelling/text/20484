The '''2009 Auburn Tigers football team''' will represent [[Auburn University]] in the 2009-2010 [[college football]] season. The Tigers do not currently have a head coach, following the announcement on December 3, 2008, that 10-year head coach [[Tommy Tuberville]] would not be returning for an eleventh season.

Auburn will play a eight-game home schedule at [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]], while traveling to [[Neyland Stadium]] to face the  [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]] for the first time since [[2004 Auburn Tigers football team|2004]]. Division opponents [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]], and [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] round out Auburn's tough road schedule.

==Coaching Change==

On December 3, 2008, Auburn University announced that 10-year head coach [[Tommy Tuberville]] would not return for an eleventh season.  The coaching search is currently ongoing, but sources indicate that Auburn is ready to announce [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State's]] second-year head coach and former Auburn defensive coordinator [[Gene Chizik]] as the Tigers' next head coach.<ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3767115</ref>

==Schedule==
Auburn's schedule consists of eight Southeastern Conference opponents (four home, four away) and four non-conference opponents. Auburn has never lost to their non-conference opponents and will be opening the season against [[Louisiana Tech]]. It will be the twelfth matchup between the schools and the first meeting since 2004. The Tigers will also be hosting [[Mid-American Conference]] opponent [[Ball State Cardinals|Ball State]] for the third time. And [[Football Championship Subdivision]] foe [[Furman University|Furman]] will be coming to the Plains for the first time since 1956. Auburn will begin conference play in the second week, hosting [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State]]. The following week, the Tigers will host the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|Mountaineers of West Virginia]], the second game in a home-and-home series between the two teams. The Tigers have previously faced all twelve regular season opponents, with Auburn holding the all-time series lead against all but [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and LSU.
