As [[editing#Executive editor|editor-in-chief]] of the bilingual Turkish-Armenian newspaper ''[[Agos]]'' (<U+0531><U+056F><U+0585><U+057D>), Dink was a prominent member of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] minority in [[Turkey]]. He was best known for his open and critical approach, in public statements and writings, to the issues of Armenian identity and the official Turkish version of the [[Armenian Genocide|1915-17 massacres of Armenians]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] which he referred to as [[genocide]].<ref name="HRW070120">{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/01/20/turkey15135.htm |title=Turkey: Outspoken Turkish-Armenian Journalist Murdered|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=2007-01-20|access-date=2007-01-24}}</ref><ref name="AIUK070119">{{cite press release|url=http://amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=17235 |title=Turkey: Murder of journalist deplored|date=2007-01-19|access-date=2007-01-24 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]}}</ref> Regarding these statements Dink was prosecuted three times for [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|insulting Turkishness]]<ref name="CPJ06SP">{{cite web | title = Bad blood in Turkey | author = By Robert Mahoney | authorlink =  | publisher = Committee to Protect Journalists | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | date = 2006-06-15 | url = http://www.cpj.org/Briefings/2006/DA_spring_06/DA_spring_06.pdf}}</ref><ref name="HRW070120"/><ref name="IPI070122">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&docid=CMS1169459655335 |title=IPI Deplores Callous Murder of Journalist in Istanbul|publisher=[[International Press Institute]] | date=2007-01-22|access-date=2007-01-24}}</ref> and received numerous death threats from Turkish nationalists who accused him of [[treason|treachery]].<ref name="CPJ070119quote">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/turkey19jan07na.html | title= Turkish-Armenian editor murdered in Istanbul | author = [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] | date=2007-01-19| accessdate=2007-01-24 | quote =Dink had received numerous death threats from nationalist Turks who viewed his iconoclastic journalism, particularly on the mass killings of Armenians in the early 20th century, as an act of treachery.}}</ref>

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Malatya]] on [[15 September]] [[1954]] to Serkis Dink (known as Ha<U+015F>im Kalfa), a tailor from [[G<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>n]], and G<U+00FC>lvart Dink, from [[Kangal]]. He had two brothers. His early childhood was spent in the care of his grandfather, whose picture Hrant kept close to his heart. His parents split because of his father's gambling problem, and this led Dink and his brothers to move to [[Istanbul]] at the age of seven, where he would spend the rest of his life. In Istanbul, he was accepted to the ''Gedikpa<U+015F>a Armenian Orphanage'' of the [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical]] Community. The orphanage was run by Rev. Hrant G<U+00FC>zelyan, who used to travel to East and South-East Turkey to find children of Armenian origin and bring them to the orphanage and raise them as Armenians.<ref name="Bolsohays9340">{{cite web|url= http://www.bolsohays.com/haberac.asp?referans=9340 |title= Terzi Ha<U+015F>im<U+2019>in o<U+011F>lu F<U+0131>rat | publisher= ''Bolsohays'' <U+2014> newsletter for Istanbul Armenians |language=Turkish}}</ref> In the orphanage Dink met his future wife, Rakel Ya<U+011F>basan from [[Silopi]]<U+2014>one of the children from South-East Turkey's [[Cizre]] region brought to Istanbul by Rev.

While he continued his high school education in [[<U+00DC>sk<U+00FC>dar Surp Ha<U+00E7> Armenian High School]], he was thrown out of school in his senior year because of suspected leftist activities, and he was compelled to complete his secondary education in the [[<U+015E>i<U+015F>li]] public high school.<ref name="DinkLife" /> In 1972, Dink changed his legal name to ''F<U+0131>rat Dink'' to disassociate his [[Maoist]] political activities from the Armenian community.<ref>{{cite news | last=Uskan | first=Arda | title=Apo'ya neden 'K<U+00FC>rt d<U+00F6>l<U+00FC>' de<U+011F>il de 'Ermeni d<U+00F6>l<U+00FC>' deniyor?

He then studied for a second Bachelor's Degree at the Philosophy Department at the same university, which he did not complete.

Hrant was an active member, and a former chairman in the [[Armenian Evangelical Church]] of Gedikpa<U+015F>a, Istanbul.<ref name='The Armenian Weekly 2007-01-27'>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Armenian Evangelical Community Mourns Dink | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.hairenik.com/armenianweekly/cty01270706.htm | work =The Armenian Weekly Newspaper | pages = | accessdate = 2007-02-04 | language = }}</ref>

== Tuzla Armenian Youth Camp ==
Together with his wife, Rachel (Rakel), Hrant Dink started to manage the ''Tuzla Armenian Youth Camp''.<ref name= "DinkAssassinated">{{cite news

The General Management of Foundations started court action to abolish Gedikpa<U+015F>a Armenian Protestant Church's ownership of the site of camp, demanding that the land be returned to its previous owner. Following a four-year legal process the court ruled that the land should be returned to its previous owner. The decision was in line with the 1974 decision of The Court of Appeals which declared that all real estate acquired by minorities after 1936 should be either returned back to their previous owners or in case of their bereavment, should be handed over to the National Real-estate Foundation. Ever since then Dink struggled to have the camp restored to the orphan children.  
   
Dink has written a book about the story of the camp but he did not succeed in his attempts. He summarized his experience of the camp: 

"I was eight when I first went to Tuzla. I have worked hard for 20 years for that camp. I met my wife Rakel there. We grew up together. We got married there. Our children were born there. But one day they handed us a court declaration. We were defeated after a five-year struggle. What could we do, we had the state against us?"<ref>{{cite news

During this period, Hrant Dink was taken into custody three times because of his political views.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Between 1980 and 1990, Dink operated a bookstore along with his brothers and stayed away from political activism.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

== Editor of ''Agos'' ==
Following the transfer of the ''Tuzla Armenian Youth Camp'' administration after 21 years of operation to direct Ministry of Education control, he decided to become the voice of his community by founding and assuming the role of editor-in-chief of ''[[Agos]]'' weekly in [[Istanbul]], a newspaper published in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. He tried to make it the democratic, opposition voice of Turkey, a voice used to inform the public of the injustices committed against the Armenian community.  One of the major aims of the newspaper was to contribute to a dialogue between the Turkish and Armenian communities, as well as between Turkey and Armenia. Additionally, he wrote for the national dailies ''[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]]'' and ''[[BirG<U+00FC>n]]''.

At its inception, ''Agos'' had only 1,800 subscriptions. With his balanced editorials, the subscription increased to 6,000 in a very short time and included many Turkish subscribers. It became a medium of communication for reaching the Armenian community and for the Armenian community to make its voice heard.<ref name="DinkLife"/>

According to Hrant Dink, ''Agos'' helped the development of the Armenian community such that it helped triple the participation in the last Patriarchal elections, trained many journalists, became the community's face to Turkish society and cultivated many friends.  He voiced his intention for an "Institute of Armenian Studies" in Istanbul.<ref name="policy3" /> 

===Editorial policy===
Dink hoped his questioning would pave the way for peace between the two peoples:

{{quote|"If I write about the [Armenian] genocide it angers the Turkish generals. I want to write and ask how we can change this historical conflict into peace. They don<U+2019>t know how to solve the [[Armenian question|Armenian problem]]."<ref name="CPJ06SP">{{cite web | title = Bad blood in Turkey | author = By Robert Mahoney | authorlink =  | publisher = Committee to Protect Journalists | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | date = 2006-06-15 | url = http://www.cpj.org/Briefings/2006/DA_spring_06/DA_spring_06.pdf}}</ref>}}

He defended his constant challenge of established notions:

{{quote |"I challenge the accepted version of history because I do not write about things in black and white. People here are used to black and white; that<U+2019>s why they are astonished that there are other shades, too."<ref name="CPJ06SP" />}}

===Armenian issues===
Dink was one of Turkey's most prominent Armenian voices and, despite threats on his life, he refused to remain silent. He always said his aim was to improve the difficult relationship between Turks and Armenians.<ref name="bbcfury">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6281193.stm |title=Fury In Turkey At Editor's Murder|accessdate=2007-01-19 |date=2007-01-19|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Active in various democratic platforms and civil society organizations, Hrant Dink emphasized the need for democratization in Turkey and focused on the issues of free speech, minority rights, civic rights and issues pertaining to the Armenian community in Turkey. He was a very important peace activist. In his public speeches, which were often intensely emotional, he never refrained from using the word genocide when talking about the Armenian Genocide, a term fiercely rejected by Turkey.<ref name="TurkishPress">{{cite news

[[Image:Hrant Dink in Screamers.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Hrant Dink featured in the [[genocide]] documentary film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]'' in 2006]]
Dink featured prominently in the 2006 [[genocide]] documentary film ''[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]'' in which he explains:
{{quote|There are Turks who don't admit that their ancestors committed genocide. If you look at it though, they seem to be nice people<U+2026>  So why don't they admit it?  Because they think that genocide is a bad thing which they would never want to commit, and because they can't believe their ancestors would do such a thing either.<ref name="policy2" > {{cite video

Hrant Dink believed that [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora Armenians]] should be able to live free of the weight of historical memory (the "residues of the past"), considering first and foremost the needs of the living majority (he said "eyes of the other side")<ref name="policy3">{{cite web|

{{quote|Turkish-Armenian relations should be taken out of a 1915 meters-deep well.<ref name="policy3" />}}

By pointing out issues of rhetorical discourse that hampered [[Armenian-Turkish relations|Armenian-Turkish]] dialogue, he believed these obstacles could be overcome to the benefit of [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish Armenians]]. Dink's unique perspective has been described as a "four way mirror", simultaneously empathetic to people of the Armenian diaspora, citizens of the [[Republic of Armenia]], [[Armenians in Turkey|Turkish Armenians]], and [[Turkish people|citizens of Turkey]].<ref name="policy3" /><br />

He was opposed to the French law that makes denial of Armenian Genocide a crime. He was planning to go to France to commit this 'crime', when  the law came into effect.<ref name="Milliyet">{{cite news

===Policy view===

Hrant Dink promoted a policy of wider integration of Turkish-Armenians into the wider Turkish society. Critical of state injustices, he often underlined the fact that a stronger Turkey would be achieved through the elimination of discrimination. Even after his conviction for speaking of the Armenian genocide, Dink continued to value his community, city, and country, noting often that his analysis and criticism was in the interest of strengthening the country. He concentrated on the mismanagement of community institutions, tried to promote obtaining rights through legal means, and was always open to compromise, once noting, "After all, Turkey is very reluctant to concede rights to its majority as well."<ref name="policy3" />

==Prosecution for "insulting Turkishness"==

Dink was prosecuted three times under [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code]] for the "crime" of <U+201C>insulting Turkishness.<U+201D><ref name="CPJ06SP">{{cite web | title = Bad blood in Turkey | author = By Robert Mahoney | authorlink =  | publisher = Committee to Protect Journalists | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-01-17 | date = 2006-06-15 | url = http://www.cpj.org/Briefings/2006/DA_spring_06/DA_spring_06.pdf}}</ref><ref name="HRW070120"/><ref name="IPI070122">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&docid=CMS1169459655335 |title=IPI Deplores Callous Murder of Journalist in Istanbul|publisher=[[International Press Institute]] | date=2007-01-22|access-date=2007-01-24}}</ref> He was acquitted the first time, convicted and received a postponed 6 months jail sentence the second time, which he had appealed at the European Court of Human Rights and at the time of his death, the prosecutor's office was getting ready to press charges for a third alleged offense. 

The first charge under the previous version of Article 301, then called Article 159, stemmed from a speech he delivered at a panel hosted by human rights NGO Mazlum-Der in <U+015E>anl<U+0131>urfa on 14 February 2002.<ref name="haber7">{{cite news

The second charge under 301 was pressed for Dink's article called "Getting to know Armenia" ([[13 February]] [[2004]]), in which he suggested to [[Armenian diaspora|diaspora Armenians]] that it was time to rid themselves of their rage against Turks, a condition he considered himself free of, keeping himself emotionally healthy while at the same time knowing something of discrimination. His statement, "replace the poisoned blood associated with the Turk, with fresh blood associated with Armenia"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-turkey/dink_3246.jsp|first=<U+00DC>st<U+00FC>n|last=Bilgen Reinart|authorlink=<U+00DC>st<U+00FC>n Bilgen Reinart|title=Hrant Dink: forging an Armenian identity in Turkey |publisher=[[openDemocracy]]|date=2006-02-07|accessdate=2007-01-19}}</ref> resulted in a six-month suspended sentence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.vatanim.com.tr/root.vatan?exec=yazardetay&tarih=&Newsid=61569&Categoryid=4&wid=94|first=<U+00DC>st<U+00FC>n|title=Why do they call Apo (Abdullah <U+00D6>calan) "Armenian spawn" rather than "Kurdish spawn"?|publisher=[[Vatan]]|date=2006-02-07|accessdate=2005-02-10}}</ref>

Dink defended himself vigorously against the charges and stated: {{quote|"This trial is based on a total misunderstanding," Dink told [[Reporters Without Borders]]. "I never meant to insult Turkish citizens. The term in question was taken out of context and is only symbolic.

In a February 2006 interview with the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], Dink spoke about his 2005 conviction of "insulting Turkishness" in a criminal court:
{{quote|"This is a political decision because I wrote about the [[Armenian genocide]] and they detest that, so they found a way to accuse me of insulting Turks."<ref name="CPJ06Feb">{{cite web | url = http://www.cpj.org/regions_07/mideast_07/dink2.pdf | title = Bad Blood in Turkey: Nationalist lawyers take aim as an Armenian-Turkish editor treads on sensitive topics. | accessdate = 2007-01-24

In the same CPJ interview, explained that while he had always been in the sights of Turkish nationalists, the past year had seen an increase in their efforts:

His appeal on the ruling that found him guilty was rejected by a Turkish court on May 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4963586.stm BBC, Turkey turns down editor's appeal]</ref> Having exhausted internal appeal mechanisms, Dink appealed to the European Court of Human Rights for an overturn of the ruling on January 15th. The appeal is on grounds that Article 301 is against freedom of expression and Dink has been discriminated against because of his Armenian ethnicity.

In his last column in ''Agos'' of January 10, 2007, Dink complained of the Turkish state propaganda against him which led many Turks to consider him an enemy of Turkey:
{{quote|"It is obvious that those wishing to alienate me and make me weak and defenceless reached their goal.

== Assassination ==
Despite his complaints, Dink never formally asked for protection from the authorities stating that he didn't want to lead a life being protected all the time. This was also confirmed by his lawyer, Erdal Do<U+011F>an.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6280687.stm BBC, Turkish-Armenian writer shunned silence]</ref><ref name="hurriyet5808478">{{cite news |title= T<U+00FC>rkiye<U+2019>yi vurdular |url= http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/5808478.asp |work= [[H<U+00FC>rriyet]] |date= 2007-01-20 |accessdate= 2007-01-25}}</ref> A week before the assassination, Dink wrote that he felt "nervous and afraid" because of the intensity of hate mail and threats he had been receiving. In his column in ''Agos'' he had written: "I see myself as frightened, the way a dove might be, but I know that the people in this country would never harm a dove."<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1580657,00.html| title="An Assassination Shocks Istanbul" |accessdate=2007-01-19 |publisher= [[TIME]]}}</ref>

Dink was assassinated around 12:00 GMT on [[19 January]] [[2007]] as he was returning to the offices of ''Agos'' after having run some errands at a nearby bank.<ref name="hurriyet5808478"/> According to a Turkish news TV channel, the killer introduced himself as a student of [[Ankara University]], and wanted to meet with Mr. Dink, but his request was rejected.

===Capture of the suspected shooter===
One day after the assassination, the police announced that the shooter had been identified in video footage collected through both Istanbul MOBESE electronic surveillance network (4000+ cameras throughout the city) and local security cameras. They later released photos to the public while urging every citizen to aid with the investigation.<!--url is of another article! <ref>{{cite news | |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/397591.asp |title=<U+0130><U+015F>te aranan zanl<U+0131> |publisher=NTVMSNBC |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2007-01-20}}</ref>--> On the same evening, Istanbul Governor [[Muammer G<U+00FC>ler]] addressed the press to state that special investigation committees were pursuing nearly two dozen leads and the police were analyzing ten thousand phone calls made from the vicinity of the crime scene. 

News agencies reported on Saturday, 18:22 GMT that the shooter had been identified as "[[Og<U+00FC>n Samast]]", a teenager born in 1990 and registered as residing in [[Trabzon]],<ref name="BBCarrest">{{cite news|title=Hrant Dink murder suspect caught|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6283477.stm |work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2007-01-20 }}</ref> the same city where barely one year ago the catholic priest [[Andrea Santoro]] was shot dead by a 16-year-old native of the city, in front of the church of Santa Maria of Trabzon, which is a nationalist gathering center <ref name="LeSoir"> [http://www.lesoir.be/actualite/monde/2007/01/20/article_un_journaliste_turc_abattu.shtml  L'ado avoue avoir tu<U+00E9> Hrant Dink sans regrets], ''[[Le Soir]]'', January 21, 2007 - URL accessed on January 22, 2007 {{fr icon}} </ref>.

Turkish Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an]] also confirmed that the alleged assassin Og<U+00FC>n Samast had been captured in Samsun, with the assassination weapon on him.

===Funeral===
Dink's funeral service was held on [[January 23]] [[2007]] in the [[Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church]] in the [[Kumkap<U+0131>]] neighborhood of Istanbul. The ceremony planned for Dink's funeral upon his assassination turned to a demonstration where a hundred thousand marched.<ref name="Funeral" >{{cite news |url=http://hurarsiv.hurriyet.com.tr/goster/haber.aspx?id=5829273 |title= Turkey embraces the memory of Hrant Dink; hundreds of thousands march |access-date=2007-01-30 |date=2007-01-24|work=[[H<U+00FC>rriyet]]}}</ref>

During a ceremony in front of the ''[[Agos]]'' office in [[Osmanbey]], Rakel Dink, Hrant Dink's widow, read a letter she had written, addressed to her murdered husband.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewanatolian.com/tna-21732.html |author= Rakel Dink |title= Letter to the Lover |access-date= 2007-01-24 |date= 2007-01-24|publisher= The New Anatolian}}</ref> Afterwards the crowd walked for eight kilometres to [[Yenikap<U+0131>]] via [[Taksim Square|Taksim]] and [[Aksaray]], while from Taksim Square onwards the coffin was taken directly to [[Kumkap<U+0131>]] for a church service. During the march, many in the crowd carried placards reading "We are all Armenian" and "We are all Hrant Dink" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and also placards stating "[[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|301]] is the murderer". As the crowd passed in front of the party offices of [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] and [[Great Union Party|BBP]], catcalls were heard.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} All leave for police in Istanbul had been cancelled, and the funeral and march proceeded without incidents.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The service was attended by members of the Turkish government, representatives from the Armenian diaspora as well as religious leaders. Although Turkey has no official diplomatic relations with Armenia, upon the invitation Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Abdullah G<U+00FC>l]], the Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister [[Arman Kirakosian]] was present at the funeral.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/2007/01/23/son/sonsiy03.asp |title=G<U+00FC>l'<U+00FC>n emriyle Ermenilere VIP kabul |access-date=2007-01-23 |date=2007-01-23|publisher=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=100902 |title= Mourners reconcile at Dink funeral |access-date= 2007-01-30 |date= 2007-01-24 |work= [[Today's Zaman (newspaper)|Today's Zaman]]}}</ref> Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an|Erdo<U+011F>an]] was not present at the funeral, because he had to attend the scheduled inauguration of the Mount Bolu Tunnel.<ref>[http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=159978 Turkish Press]</ref>

After the church services, the hearse made a final tour for the thousands of marchers still gathered at Yenikap<U+0131>, before proceeding to Bal<U+0131>kl<U+0131> Armenian Cemetery in Istanbul's [[Zeytinburnu]] neighborhood, where Dink's body was laid to rest. At the cemetry Rev. Krikor Agabaloglu (Pastor of the Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedikpa<U+015F>a) and Rev. Rene Levonian (Armenian Evangelical World Council's representative) delivered short speeches in Turkish and in Armenian.

*  On [[February 1]], [[2007]], the private Turkish television channel ''TGRT'', which was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]], broadcast video footage of the man accused of shooting Hrant Dink posing proudly behind a Turkish flag, flanked by police officers of both military and security police, allegedly filmed in the police bureau of Samsun where he was taken after his arrest. In the background was a poster bearing the words of [[Kemal Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]: "The nation's land is sacred. It cannot be left to fate." The video caused shock and consternation as commentators warned it was another sign of the growing power of Turkish ultra-nationalism, as the nation gears up for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year. Ismet Berkan, editor of the liberal newspaper [[Radikal]], said that the release of the video was like killing Mr Dink a second time. It proved, he claimed, "that the murderer and his associates are not alone, that their supporters ... have penetrated all segments of the state." A police spokesperson said an investigation into the video footage and its leaking was under way.<ref>{{cite news

* [[ARTICLE 19]]: <U+201C>The Turkish authorities must also take a very hard look at their own role: their failure to repeal Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code, the continuing use of this and other provisions to prosecute writers, journalists and others that dare speak out on taboo topics, and the authorities<U+2019> public criticism of these voices: all of these contribute to creating an environment that legitimises attacks on freedom of expression, including attacks of a most violent and deadly nature,<U+201D> said Dr. Agn<U+00E8>s Callamard, ARTICLE 19<U+2019>s Executive Director.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.article19.org/pdfs/press/turkey-murder-of-hrant-dink.pdf | title=Turkey: Killing of Turkish-Armenian Journalist Hrant Dink | date=2007-01-19 | access-date=2007-01-24 |publisher=[[ARTICLE 19]] | format=PDF}}</ref>

====Journalism Organizations====
* [[Reporters Without Borders]]: "This murder will distress and disturb all those who defend the freedom of thought and expression in Turkey and elsewhere," the press freedom organization said. "The Turkish government must weigh the extreme gravity of this crime and ensure that a thorough investigation identifies those responsible as quickly as possible."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=20490 |title= Deep shock over Turkish-Armenian editor<U+2019>s murder today in Istanbul|publisher=Reporters Without Borders|date=2007-01-19|access-date=2007-01-19}}</ref>
* [[International Federation of Journalists]]: <U+201C>This man has been the target of abuse and threats ever since he dared to express an opinion that challenges an established orthodoxy,<U+201D> said Aidan White, IFJ General Secretary. <U+201C>It is scandalous that he appears to have become the victim of a culture of intolerance that remains deeply rooted in parts of society.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/default.asp?Index=4573&Language=EN |title=IFJ Condemns <U+201C>Intolerant Culture<U+201D> After Turkish-Armenian Editor is Shot Dead in Turkey|publisher=[[International Federation of Journalists]]|date=2007-01-19|access-date=2007-01-24}}</ref>
* [[International Press Institute]]: "This is a terrible event for Turkish press freedom. It sends the inevitable signal to all Turkish media that, if you discuss the Armenian massacre in the same terms as Dink, you face not only constant harassment from the authorities, but the possibility of assassination. [...] I think the time has now come for the government to realise that such laws have no place in a modern society. I would also hope that, following Dink<U+2019>s murder, there is an open discussion about these issues leading to an agreement by all sides to consign such laws to Turkish history," said IPI Director Johann P. Fritz.<ref name="IPI070122">{{cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&docid=CMS1169459655335 |title=IPI Deplores Callous Murder of Journalist in Istanbul|publisher=[[International Press Institute]] | date=2007-01-22|access-date=2007-01-24}}</ref>
* [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]: "Through his journalism Hrant Dink sought to shed light on Turkey<U+2019>s troubled past and create a better future for Turks and Armenians. This earned him many enemies, but he vowed to continue writing despite receiving many threats," said CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon. "An assassin has now silenced one of Turkey<U+2019>s most courageous voices. We are profoundly shocked and saddened by this crime, and send our deepest condolences to Hrant Dink<U+2019>s family, colleagues, and friends."<ref name="CPJ070119">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpj.org/news/2007/mideast/turkey19jan07na.html |title= Turkish-Armenian editor murdered in Istanbul| author = [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]| date=2007-01-19| accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>
* [[PEN American Center]]: "We are horrified," said Larry Siems, Director of Freedom to Write and International Programs at PEN American Center. "Hrant Dink was one of the heroes of the nonviolent movement for freedom of expression in Turkey<U+2014>a movement in which writers, editors, and publishers have practiced civil disobedience by defying laws that censored or suppressed important truths in that country. Theirs is one of the most significant human rights movements of our time. Hrant Dink<U+2019>s countrymen can help cement some of the gains he helped win for them by sending a strong, unified message that those responsible must be brought to justice for his murder."<ref name="PEN070119"/>
* [[International PEN]]: "The murder [...] of Armenian-Turkish writer and editor Hrant Dink, the courageous and principled advocate for dialogue and understanding between the Armenian minority and the Turks, is an appalling act. Hrant Dink<U+2019>s fellow writers worldwide express their profound shock at this terrible loss. Dink, whose campaign against the law making it a crime to insult the Turkish State, particularly as it relates to the killings of Armenians in the early years of the last century, has paid the highest price with his own life."  Jiri Grusa, International President of International PEN, the world association of writers, called the murder <U+201C>a symptom of old hatreds that threaten the relationship of all Turkish people to the democratic values shared in Europe and the world.<U+201D><ref>{{cite press release |title=PEN Statement on the Murder of Hrant Dink in Turkey |publisher=[[International PEN]] |date=2007-01-19 |url=http://www.internationalpen.org.uk/index.php?pid=33&aid=533&query= |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>
