'''Pennsylvania Traffic Route 858''' (designated by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation]] as '''SR 0858''') is a {{convert|16.58|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] located in [[Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Susquehanna]] County in [[Pennsylvania]].  The southern terminus is at [[Pennsylvania Route 706|PA 706]] in [[Rush Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania|Rush Twp]].  The northern terminus is the [[New York]] state line in [[Little Meadows, Pennsylvania|Little Meadows]]. The route from there continues as Tioga County Highway 601. The route was assigned in 1928, completed a year later, and has remained the same since, with an exception of its southern terminus changing designations from [[Pennsylvania Route 67]].

== Route description ==
State Route 858 begins at an intersection with [[Pennsylvania Route 706|State Route 706]] in the Rush Township community of Rushville. The highway begins its long trek in Susquehanna County by progressing northward in a patch of forests. Route 858, which runs west of a creek, is sparsely populated and homes are rare. State Route 858 winds its way in and out of forests, heading on a northeast direction. Soon after, there is an intersection with Keefs Hill Road, a locally-maintained highway. After Keefs Hill Road, State Route 858 heads back into a dense patch of trees. In the forest, is an intersection with C. Warner Road, and soon after comes one for Shadduck Road.<ref name="yahoo"/> 

Although the dense forest ends, trees continue to surround the highway. The route turns a short drift off its alignment at an intersection with Miller Road. The route turns from the northward direction it was heading to a northwestern direction and intersects eventually with Guilton Road. The dense forestry returns, and Route 858 begins winding its way along. Residential homes have all but disappeared from the route, with trees showing the way into Middletown Center. State Route 858 passes a pond to the east, intersecting with the former alignment of [[Pennsylvania Route 859|State Route 859]], now a locally-maintained highway known as Vet Davis Road and Camp Corby Road.<ref name="yahoo"/> 

After leaving Middletown Center, State Route 858 continues northward and sometimes northeastward. After Middletown Center, Route 858 is surrounded by nothing but trees. There is a break in the trees when State Route 858 intersects with an unnamed road, which serves as a connector to Township Road 768. The state traffic route continues to the northwest, intersecting with Township Road 687. As State Route 858 continues, it enters Apolacon Township, where the dense forestry begins to break, and homes begin to show the way. After a short pond is passed, the highway enters Little Meadows. At Maple Avenue, Route 858 runs on its final stretch, passing homes all the way to the New York state line. There, State Route 858 ends and becomes Tioga County Highway 601 (Pennsylvania Avenue).<ref name="yahoo"/>
