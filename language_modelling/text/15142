'''''To Kill a Mockingbird''''' is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel by [[Harper Lee]] published in [[1960 in literature|1960]]. It was instantly successful upon its release and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10&nbsp;years old. 

The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, [[Atticus Finch]], has served as a moral hero for many readers, and a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "[i]n the twentieth century, ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<ref name="crespino">{{cite journal|last=Crespino|first=Joseph|title=The Strange Career of Atticus Finch|journal=Southern Cultures|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|volume=6|issue=no. 2|month=Summer|year=2000|pages=p. 9&ndash;29}}</ref>

As a [[Southern Gothic]] novel and a ''[[bildungsroman]]'', the primary themes of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence, but scholars have also noted that Lee addresses the issues of class tensions, courage and compassion, and gender roles in the American [[Deep South]]. The book is widely taught in schools in English-speaking countries with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' has been the target of various campaigns to have it removed from public classrooms. Often the book is challenged for its use of racial [[epithet]]s, and writers have noticed that although white readers react favorably to the novel, black readers tend to respond less positively.

Lee's novel was initially reviewed by at least 30&nbsp;newspapers and magazines, which varied widely in their assessment of it. More recently, it has been ranked by librarians before the [[Bible]] as a book "every adult should read before they die".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1721526,00.html|last=Pauli|first=Michelle|title=Harper Lee tops librarians' must-read list|publisher=Guardian Unlimited|accessdate=2008-02-13|date=2006-03-02}}</ref>  The book was adapted into [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|an Oscar-winning film]] in 1962 by director [[Robert Mulligan]], with a screenplay by [[Horton Foote]]. Since 1990 a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown of [[Monroeville, Alabama]], transforming the town into a tourist destination. To date, it is Lee's only published novel, and although she continues to respond to the book's impact, she has refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.

== Biographical background and publication ==

Born in 1926, [[Harper Lee]] grew up in the Southern town of [[Monroeville, Alabama]], where she became close friends with the soon-to-be famous writer [[Truman Capote]].  She attended [[Huntingdon College]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] (1944<U+2013>45), and then pursued a law degree at the [[University of Alabama]] (1945<U+2013>49).  While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: ''Huntress'' at Huntingdon and the humor magazine ''Rammer Jammer'' at the University of Alabama. At both schools, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on these campuses at the time.<ref>Shields, p. 79&ndash;99.</ref> In 1950, she moved to [[New York City]], where she worked as a reservation clerk for [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a [[literary agent]] recommended by Capote.  An editor at [[J. B. Lippincott & Co.|J. B. Lippincott]] advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.  Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/famous/academy/h_lee.html|title=Nelle Harper Lee|work=Alabama Academy of Honor|publisher=Alabama Department of Archives and History|year=2001|accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref>

Lee spent two and a half years writing ''To Kill a Mockingbird''. A description of the book's creation by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] relates an episode wherein Lee became so frustrated that she tossed the manuscript out the window into the snow. Her agent made her retrieve it from the street.<ref name="nea"/> The book was published on [[July 11]], [[1960]]. It was initially titled ''Atticus'', but Lee retitled the novel to reflect a story that went beyond a character portrait.<ref>Shields, p. 129.</ref> The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies at the most.<ref>Shields, p. 14.</ref>  In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'&nbsp;<U+2026>&nbsp;I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected."<ref name="lapl"/>  Instead of a "quick and merciful death", the book was republished in part by ''[[Reader's Digest Condensed Books]]'', which gave it a wide readership immediately.<ref>Shields, p.&nbsp;242.</ref>  Since its publication, it has never been out of print.

==Plot summary==
{{see also|List of characters in To Kill a Mockingbird}}

The story takes place during three years of the [[Great Depression]] in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama. The narrator, six-year-old Scout Finch, lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt for the summer. The three children are terrified by, and fascinated with, their neighbor, the [[recluse|reclusive]] "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo and for many years, few have seen him. The children feed each other's imaginations with rampant rumors about his grotesque appearance and his reasons for remaining hidden, and they dream of ways to get him to come out of his house. Following two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times, the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, never appears in person. 

Atticus is assigned to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Scout is subjected to other children taunting Atticus, calling him a "nigger-lover", and she is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. For his part, Atticus faces a group of men intent on [[lynching]] Tom, but this danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus' and Tom's points of view.

Because Atticus does not want them to be present at Tom Robinson's trial, Scout, Jem, and Dill watch in secret from the [[racial segregation|colored balcony]]. Atticus establishes that the accusers <U+2013> Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town [[Alcoholism|drunk]] <U+2013> are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella was making sexual advances towards Tom and that her father caught her in the act. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, he is [[convicted]]. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken, as is Atticus', when a hopeless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison. 

Bob Ewell is humiliated by the trial and vows revenge. He spits in Atticus' face on the street, tries to break into the judge's house, and menaces Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout as they walk home from a [[Halloween]] pageant at their school. Jem's arm is broken in the struggle, but, amid the confusion, someone comes to their rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout eventually recognizes him as the reclusive Boo Radley.

Maycomb's sheriff arrives and discovers that Bob Ewell has been killed. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of holding Jem or Boo responsible. Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective and regrets that they never repaid him for the gifts he had given them.

==Autobiographical elements==

Lee has said that ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' is not an [[autobiography]], but rather an example of how an author "should write about what he knows and write truthfully".<ref>"Harper Lee," in ''American Decades''. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout.  Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder.  After they were convicted, hanged, and mutilated,<ref>Shields, p. 120&ndash;121.</ref> he never tried another criminal case.   Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper; although more conservative than Atticus with regard to race, he gradually became more liberal in his later years.<ref>Shields, p. 122&ndash;125.</ref> Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, and Lee was 25 when her mother died, her mother was prone to a [[neurosis|nervous condition]] that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.<ref>Shields, p. 40&ndash;41.</ref> Lee also had a brother named Edwin, who <U+2013> like the fictional Jem <U+2013> was four years older than his sister. As in the novel, a black housekeeper came once a day to care for the Lee house and family. 

The character of Dill was modeled on Lee's childhood friend, [[Truman Capote]], known then as Truman Persons.<ref>Krebs, Albin. "Truman Capote Is Dead at 59; Novelist of Style and Clarity", ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[August 26]], [[1984]], p.&nbsp;1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5229/is_2003/ai_n19145400|title=Truman Capote|work=UXL Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2003 |accessdate=2007-11-13}}</ref> Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City.<ref name="fleming">{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Anne Taylor|title=The Private World of Truman Capote|work=The New York Times Magazine|date=[[1976-07-09]]|page=SM6|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>  Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote were atypical children: both loved to read, and whereas Lee was a scrappy [[tomboy]] who was quick to fight, Capote was the object of ridicule for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] typewriter Lee's father gave them. They became very good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them "apart people".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Go Right Ahead and Ask Me Anything (And So She Did): An Interview with Truman Capote | journal = [[McCall's]] | month = November | year = 1967| pages = p. 76}}</ref>  In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murder that was the basis of Capote's [[nonfiction novel]], ''[[In Cold Blood]]''.   

Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24&nbsp;years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten by everyone he knew and died in 1952.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hile|first=Kevin S.|chapter=Harper Lee|title=Authors and Artists for Young Adults|volume=13|month=August|year=1994|isbn=9780810385665}}</ref> 

The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, though many have speculated that his inspiration came from several models. When Lee was 10&nbsp;years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper, and Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1937.<ref name="bigg">{{cite news|last=Bigg|first=Matthew|title=Novel Still Stirs Pride, Debate; 'Mockingbird' Draws Tourists to Town Coming to Grips With Its Past|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=[[2007-09-23]]|page=A3}}</ref> Scholars have guessed that the inspiration for Tom Robinson's plight was the infamous case of the [[Scottsboro Boys]],<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. 7&ndash;11.</ref> in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on very poor evidence. However, Lee stated in 2005 that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served "the same purpose" to display Southern [[prejudice]]s.<ref>Shields, p. 118.</ref> [[Emmett Till]], a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in [[Mississippi]] in 1955, and whose death is credited as the catalyst for the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], is also considered a model for Tom Robinson.<ref name="chura">{{cite journal|last=Chura|first=Patrick|title=Prolepsis and Anachronism: Emmet Till and the Historicity of To Kill a Mockingbird|journal=Southern Literary Journal|year=2000|month=Spring|volume=32|issue=2|pages=p. 1}}</ref>

==Style==

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=right|quote=<div style="text-align:left;">''"Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition."'' 
|source=R. A. Dave in ''Harper Lee's Tragic Vision'', 1974
}}

Critics and reviewers note one of Lee's strongest elements of style is her talent for storytelling, which in one review was called "tactile brilliance".<ref name="timerev"/> Later, another scholar wrote, "Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition."<ref name="dave"/> Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood. This narrative method allows Lee to tell a "delightfully deceptive" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations, complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition.<ref>Ward, L. "To Kill a Mockingbird (book review)." ''Commonwealth'': [[December 9]], [[1960]].</ref> However, at times the blending is effective enough to cause reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding.<ref name="adams"/> Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic [[Granville Hicks]] expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.<ref name="LeMay">{{cite news|last=LeMay|first=Harding|title=Children Play; Adults Betray|work=[[New York Herald Tribune]]|date=[[1960-07-10]]}}</ref><ref name="Hicks">{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Granville|title=Three at the Outset|journal=Saturday Review|volume=XLIII|issue=30|date=[[1960-07-23]]}}</ref>

Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: "Laughter&nbsp;... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly&nbsp;... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at."<ref name="humor">{{cite book|last=Tavernier-Courbin|first=Jacqueline|chapter=Humor and Humanity in To Kill a  Mockingbird|title=On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections|editor= Alice Petry (ed.)|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2007|isbn=9781572335783}}</ref> Scout's role as a girl who beats up boys, hates wearing dresses, and swears for the fun of it provides humor, but Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses [[parody]], [[satire]], and [[irony]] to address complex issues, especially by using a child's perspective.  After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times.<ref>Lee, p. 46.</ref> Lee employs satire in describing Scout's first day in school, a frustrating experience; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further.<ref>Lee, p. 19.</ref> Scout tries to converse with Atticus' client, Mr. Cunningham, about what she understands as his "entailment", after he arrives to lynch Tom Robinson.<ref>p. 174.</ref> However, Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking&mdash;of education, the justice system, and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.<ref name="humor"/>

Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Boerman-Cornell|first=William|title=The Five Humors|journal=English Journal|volume=88|issue=4|year=1999}}</ref> When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a [[Sunday school]] classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]]. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, where they get a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's.<ref>Lee, p. 133.</ref> Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. Scout is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.<ref>Lee, p. 297.</ref> 

===Genres===
Scholars have characterized ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' as both a [[Southern Gothic]] novel and a ''[[bildungsroman]]''. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] in the novel.<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. 40&ndash;41.</ref><ref name="blackall"/> Lee used the term "Gothic" to describe the [[Gothic architecture|architecture]] of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. 39&ndash;45.</ref> Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts. One scholar notes that Lee challenges every authority in Maycomb: the school and its teachers, the criminal justice system, and the religious establishments. Yet Scout still reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism.<ref name="fine">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Laura|chapter=Structuring the Narrator's Rebellion in To Kill a Mockingbird|title=On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections||editor=Alice Petry (ed.)|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2007|isbn=9781572335783}}</ref> However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, [[incest]], rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town [[Literary realism|realistically]] rather than melodramatically. She portrayed the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues.<ref name="blackall"/>

The children, Scout and Jem, face hard realities and learn from them in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', leading critics to categorize the novel as a ''bildungsroman'', which typically describes the coming-of-age of the main character.  Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. As Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon&nbsp;... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like".<ref>Lee, p. 246.</ref> This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood.  As one scholar writes, "''To Kill a Mockingbird'' can be read as a feminist bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be."<ref name="ware"/>

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=right|quote=<div style="text-align:left;">''In the 33&nbsp;years since its publication,'' (To Kill a Mockingbird) ''has never been the focus of a dissertation, and it has been the subject of only six literary studies, several of them no more than a couple of pages long.'' 
|source=Claudia Johnson in ''To Kill a Mockingbird: Threatening Boundaries'', 1994
}}
Despite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Claudia Durst Johnson, author of several books and articles about ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', wrote in 1994: "In the 33&nbsp;years since its publication, it has never been the focus of a dissertation, and it has been the subject of only six literary studies, several of them no more than a couple of pages long."<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. 20.</ref> Another writer agreed in 2003 when he wrote that the book is "an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined".<ref name="riseatticus"/> 

Harper Lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused: "Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners."<ref name="twits">{{cite news|title=Harper Lee Twits School Board In Virginia for Ban on Her Novel|work=The New York Times|date=[[1966-01-16]]|page=82}}</ref>

===Southern life and racial injustice===

When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them.<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. 20&ndash;24</ref>  The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood. Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors. One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic [[Regionalism (literature)|regionalism]].<ref name="erisman">{{cite journal|last=Erisman|first=Fred|title=The Romantic Regionalism of Harper Lee|journal=The Alabama Review|volume=XXVI|issue=2|month=April|year=1973}}</ref> This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern [[caste system]] to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. For example, Aunt Alexandra explains Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages through [[genealogy]] (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks),<ref name="bruell">{{cite journal|last=Bruell|first=Edwin|title=Keen Scalpel on Racial Ills|journal=English Journal|volume=51|issue=9|month=December|year=1964}}</ref> whereas the narrator describes the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb in detail. This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Atticus' definition of "fine folks" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have. [[Southern United States|The South]] itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to affect the plot more than the characters.<ref name="erisman"/> 

The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed "the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro".<ref name="LeMay"/> In the years following its release, many reviewers considered ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' a novel primarily concerned with [[race relations]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=R|title=To Kill a Mockingbird|journal=Library Journal|date=[[1960-05-15]]}}</ref> Claudia Durst Johnson considers it "reasonable to believe" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: [[Rosa Parks]]' refusal to sit at the back of the bus, which sparked the 1955 [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], and the 1956 riots at the [[University of Alabama]] after [[Autherine Lucy]] and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled).<ref name="secret">{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Claudia|title=The Secret Courts of Men's Hearts|journal=Studies in American Fiction|month=Autumn|year=1991|volume=19|issue=2}}</ref> In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: "''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition."<ref name="hovet"/> The novel's impact on race relations in the United States was noted as a factor in its success, that it "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement".<ref>{{cite book|last=Flora|first=Joseph|chapter=Harper Lee|title=Southern Writers: A New Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2006}}</ref>  Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them.<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p. xi-xiv</ref><ref name="bloom">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Modern Critical Interpretations: 'To Kill a Mockingbird'|publisher=Chelsea House Publishers|location=Philadelphia|year=1999}}</ref><ref>Shields, p. 219&ndash;220, 223, 233&ndash;235</ref>

Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the "mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood".<ref name="chura"/> Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers, who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, when more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways.<ref name="chura"/> Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as "stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=Roslyn|title=The Black Man and the Macabre in American Literature|journal=Black American Literature Forum|publisher=Indiana State University|year=1976}}</ref> Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times. 

The theme of racial injustice appears [[symbolism|symbolically]] in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a [[Rabies|rabid]] dog, even though it is not his job to do so.<ref>Lee, p. 107&ndash;113.</ref> Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog,<ref name="jones">{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Carolyn|title=Atticus Finch and the Mad Dog|journal=Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South|month=Summer|year=1996|volume=34|issue=4}}</ref> must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike [[imagery]] from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes.

Although the novel has had a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, it has received a more ambiguous reception by black readers.

===Class===
In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was "to be&nbsp;... the Jane Austen of South Alabama."<ref name="blackall">{{cite book|last=Blackall|first=Jean|chapter=Valorizing the Commonplace: Harper Lee's Response to Jane Austen|title=On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections|editor=Alice Petry (ed.)|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|year=2007|isbn=9781572335783}}</ref> Both [[Jane Austen|Austen]] and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. For example, Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day; Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so.<ref>Lee, p. 27.</ref> Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia.<ref>Lee, p. 155.</ref> One writer notes that Scout, "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.<ref name="shackleford"/>  Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: "affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status".<ref name="blackall"/> 

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=right|quote=<div style="text-align:left;">''Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation.''

}}

Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash'&nbsp;... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation."<ref name="hovet">{{cite journal|last=Hovet|first=Theodore and Grace-Ann|title='Fine Fancy Gentlemen' and 'Yappy Folk': Contending Voices in To Kill a Mockingbird|journal=Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South|month=Fall|year=2001|volume=40}}</ref> Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of [[nostalgia]]. Along with Scout and Jem, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative [[antebellum]] Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community. The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.<ref name="hovet"/>

===Courage and compassion===
The novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of [[courage]].<ref>"Nelle Harper Lee." ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Gale, 2007.</ref><ref name="jolley">{{cite journal|last=Jolley|first=Susan|title=Integrating Poetry and "To Kill a Mockingbird"|journal=English Journal|year=2002}}</ref> For example, Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him. Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage. In a statement that [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]]s Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a [[morphine]] addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is "when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what".<ref>Lee, p. 128.</ref> 

Charles Shields, who wrote the only biography of Harper Lee to date, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal."<ref>Shields, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Atticus' lesson to Scout that "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view <U+2013> until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it" exemplifies his compassion.<ref>Lee, p. 33.</ref><ref name="jolley"/> She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. One writer remarks, "[w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings."<ref name="jolley"/>

===Gender roles===
Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider.<ref name="ware">{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Michele|chapter='Just a Lady': Gender and Power in Harper Lee<U+2019>s ''To Kill a Mockingbird''|title=Women in literature: reading through the lens of gender|editor=Jerilyn Fisher and Ellen S. Silber (eds.)|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=9780313313462}}</ref> Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her own desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.<ref name="shackleford">{{cite journal|last=Shackleford|first=Dean|title=The Female Voice in To Kill a Mockingbird: Narrative Strategies in Film and Novel|journal=Mississippi Quarterly: The Journal of Southern Cultures|month=Winter|year=1996&ndash;1997|volume=50|issue=1|pages=p. 101&ndash;13}}</ref> For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and [[camisole]], and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child."<ref name="shackleford"/>

Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley died before Boo was confined to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers.<ref name="finegender">{{cite journal|last=Fine|first=Laura|title=Gender Conflicts and Their 'Dark' Projections in Coming of Age White Female Southern Novels|journal=Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South|year=1998|month=Summer|volume=36|issue=4|pages=p. 121&ndash;29}}</ref> Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter,<ref name="baecker"/> and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart from other men as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: "It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight."<ref name="finegender"/>

===Laws, written and unwritten===

''To Kill a Mockingbird'' is noted for its extensive [[allusion]]s to legal issues, particularly in those scenes outside of the courtroom, and has drawn the attention of legal scholars.  Claudia Durst Johnson notes that "a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals."<ref>Johnson, ''Boundaries'' p.25&ndash;27.</ref> The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist [[Charles Lamb]] reads: "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once." Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms:  Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for marrying a black woman and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him.<ref name="secret"/> Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's "fanatical" attempts to place her in them made her feel "a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]".<ref>Lee, p. 146.</ref> Johnson states, "[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds."<ref name="secret"/>

===Death of innocence===
[[Image:Mimus polyglottus1 cropped.png|thumb|Lee used the mockingbird to symbolize innocence in the novel.]]
Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. For example, the family's last name is Finch.<ref>Finch was also Lee's mother's maiden name.</ref> The titular [[Northern Mockingbird|mockingbird]] is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot.  Atticus warns them that, although they can "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird".<ref>Lee, p. 103.</ref> Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie Atkinson, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us."<ref>Lee, p. 103.</ref> Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, "'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless<U+2014>like Tom Robinson."<ref name="bruell"/> Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.<ref name="schuster">{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=Edgar|title=Discovering Theme and Structure in the Novel|journal=English Journal|volume=52|issue=7|year=1963}}</ref><ref name="dave"/><ref>Johnson, ''Casebook'' p. 207.</ref> 

Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel.  However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird' <U+2013> that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished."<ref>Metress, Christopher. "Lee, Harper." ''Contemporary Southern Writers''. St. James Press, 1999.</ref> The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout  relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson<ref name="chura"/> states about a character who was misunderstood, "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things&nbsp;... Atticus, he was real nice," to which he responds, "Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them."<ref>Lee, p.&nbsp;322<U+2013>323.</ref>

The novel exposes the loss of innocence (and innocents) so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims it is inevitable that all the characters have faced or will face defeat, giving it elements of a classical [[tragedy]].<ref name="dave">{{cite book|last=Dave|first=R.A.|chapter=Harper Lee's Tragic Vision|title=Indian Studies in American Fiction|publisher=MacMillan Company of India, Ltd|year=1974|isbn=978-0333900345}}</ref> In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting [[irony]].  For example, irony is employed by Lee as Scout witnesses the Missionary Society meeting, whose members mock Scout, gossip, and "reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races" while giving the "appearance of gentility, piety, and morality".<ref name="shackleford"/> Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for  his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.<ref>Lee, p.&nbsp;241.</ref>

=== Atticus Finch and the legal profession ===
{{main|Atticus Finch}}

One of the most significant impacts ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' has had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, "Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person."<ref>Petry, p. xxiii.</ref> [[Morris Dees]] of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the [[Timothy McVeigh]] trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence.<ref>Petry, p. xxiv.</ref> One law professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]] stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was ''To Kill a Mockingbird'', and an article in the ''Michigan Law Review'' claims, "No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," before questioning whether, "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lubet|first=Steven|title=Reconstructing Atticus Finch|journal=Michigan Law Review|volume=97|issue=no. 6|month=May|year=1999|pages=p. 1339&ndash;62}}</ref>

In 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalized [[racism]] and [[sexism]] and should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero.<ref>Petry, p. xxv<U+2013>xxvii.</ref> Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Metress|first=Christopher|title=The Rise and Fall of Atticus Finch|journal=The Chattahoochee Review|volume=24|issue=1|month=September|year=2003}}</ref> However, in 1997, the Alabama Bar Association erected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the "first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history".<ref>{{cite news|title='Mockingbird' Hero Honored in Monroeville|work=The Birmingham News|location=Alabama|date=[[1997-05-03]]|page=7A}}</ref>

===Controversy===
====Challenges and bans====
''To Kill a Mockingbird'' has been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across America. The [[American Library Association]] reported that ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was #41 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1990<U+2013>2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/oif/bannedbooksweek/bbwlinks/100mostfrequently.htm|title=100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990<U+2013>2000|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=bbwlinks&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=136590|title=Banned and/or Challenged Books|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> 

One of the first incidents of the book being challenged was in [[Hanover, Virginia]] in 1966: a parent protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.<ref>Johnson, ''Casebook'' p. 208&ndash;213.</ref> Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 to ''The Richmond News Leader'' suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of "the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice".<ref name="twits"/> 

The controversy that has surrounded the book has not been limited to the United States. In the late 1990s, school districts in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia, Canada]] attempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula, stating:

<blockquote>
The terminology in this novel subjects students to humiliating experiences that rob them of their self-respect and the respect of their peers. The word 'Nigger' is used 48 times [in] the novel...We believe that the English Language Arts curriculum in Nova Scotia must enable all students to feel comfortable with ideas, feelings and experiences presented without fear of humiliation ... ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' is clearly a book that no longer meets these goals and therefore must no longer be used for classroom instruction."<ref name="saney">{{cite journal|last=Saney|first=Isaac|title=The Case Against To Kill a Mockingbird|journal=Race & Class|volume=45|issue=no. 1|month=July&ndash;September|year=2003|pages=p. 99&ndash;110}}</ref>
</blockquote>

The response to these attempts to remove the book from standard teaching was passionate across Canada and the United States, and many of the initial complainants were labeled as overly sensitive and "benign censors."<ref name="saney"/> Isaac Saney, who supports attempts to ban the book, concludes that the media response to the removal effort was a form of institutionalized racism: "The media's editorialising against all 'censorship' and 'banning' includes vigorous hostility to the censorship and banning of racism. Its advocacy of freedom of speech includes freedom of speech for racists and fascists."<ref name="saney"/>

====Canard of Capote authorship====

Lee's childhood friend, the author [[Truman Capote]], wrote on the dust jacket of the first edition, "[s]omeone rare has written this very fine first novel: a writer with the liveliest sense of life, and the warmest, most authentic sense of humor. A touching book; and so funny, so likeable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pprize.com/BookDetail.php?bk=43|title=First Edition Points to identify To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee|work=Pulitzer Prize First Edition Guide|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref>  This comment has been construed to suggest that Capote wrote the book or edited it heavily.<ref name="nea">{{cite web| url=http://www.neabigread.org/books/mockingbird/mockingbird04.php| title=National Endowment of the Arts. "The Big Read: To Kill a Mockingbird (About the Author)." | publisher=National Endowment of the Arts | accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> The only supporting evidence for this rumor is the 2003 report of a [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] newspaper, which quoted Capote's biological father, Archulus Persons, as claiming that Capote had written "almost all" of the book.<ref>{{cite news|last=Windham|first=Ben|title=An Encounter with Harper Lee|work=The Tuscaloosa News|date=[[2003-08-24]]}}</ref> The rumors were put to rest in 2006 when a Capote letter was donated to Monroeville's literary heritage museum. Writing to a neighbor in Monroeville in 1959, Capote mentioned that Lee was writing a book that was to be published soon. Extensive notes between Lee and her editor at Lippincott also refute the rumor of Capote's authorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ledger.southofboston.com/articles/2006/02/27/news/news01.txt|title=To kill a rumor: Capote letter helps solve <U+2018>Mockingbird<U+2019> mystery|last=Scheible|first=Sue|date=[[2006-02-27]]|work=[[The Patriot Ledger]]|accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> Lee's older sister Alice has responded to the rumor, saying: "That's the biggest lie ever told."<ref name="bigg"/>

=== Honors ===
During the years immediately following the novel's publication, Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book.  In 1961, when ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the [[1961 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]], stunning Harper Lee.<ref>Shields, p.199<U+2013>200.</ref> It also won the Brotherhood Award of the [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]] in the same year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bain|first=Robert|year=1980|chapter=Harper Lee|title=Southern Writers: A Biographical Dictionary|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|pages=p. 276&ndash;277|isbn=080710390X}}</ref> Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining of monotonous questioning. She has declined ever since to talk with reporters about the book. She has also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity.

The book was made into the well-received film [[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|with the same title]], starring [[Gregory Peck]] in [[1962 in film|1962]]. The film's producer, [[Alan J. Pakula]], remembered [[Paramount Studios]] executives questioning him about a potential script: "They said, 'What story do you plan to tell for the film?' I said, 'Have you read the book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'"<ref name="nichols">{{cite news|last=Nichols|first=Peter|title=Time Can't Kill 'Mockingbird' [Review]|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[1998-02-27]]|page=E.1}}</ref> The movie won three [[Oscars]]: [[Best Actor]] for Gregory Peck, [[Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White]], and [[Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium]] for Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars including [[Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for [[Mary Badham]], the actress who played Scout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1206823317863|title=To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=2008-03-29}}.</ref>

Harper Lee was pleased with the movie, saying: "In that film the man and the part met .... I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art."<ref name="joneshistory">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Carolyn|chapter=Harper Lee|title=The History of Southern Women's Literature|editor=Carolyn Perry (ed.)|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|year=2002|isbn=9780807127537}}</ref> Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release, and Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocketwatch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for best actor.<ref name="peckint">{{cite news|last=Bobbin|first=Jay|title=Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch in Harper Lee's ''To Kill a Mockingbird''|work=[[The Birmingham News]]|location=Alabama|date=[[1997-12-21]]|page=1.F}}</ref> Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in [[London Heathrow Airport]].

In May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] for an event in her honor. It was hosted by Peck's widow Veronique, who said of Lee: "She's like a national treasure. She's someone who has made a difference<U+2026>with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays.

===Play===
The book has also been adapted as a play by [[Christopher Sergel]]. It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself "The Literary Capital of Alabama". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monroecountyal.com/heritage.html|title=Literary History of Monroeville|publisher=Monroeville Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated. Author [[Albert Murray (writer)|Albert Murray]] said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance), "It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of [[Mardi Gras]]. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education<U+2014>what Monroeville aspires to be."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Roy|title=Long Lives the Mockingbird|work=New York Times Book Review|location=New York|date=[[1998-08-09]]|page=31}}</ref>  

According to a ''[[National Geographic]]'' article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself has refused to attend any performances, because "she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0601/feature8/?fs=www3.nationalgeographic.com&fs=plasma.nationalgeographic.com|title=To Catch a Mockingbird|last=Newman|first=Cathy|month=January|year=2006|publisher=NationalGeographic.com|accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref> To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes named "Calpurnia's Cookbook" not be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/features/The-one-and-only.2770816.jp|last=Robinson|first=David|title=The One and Only|publisher=Scotsman.com.|accessdate=2008-03-29}}</ref> Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists have come to Monroeville, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself.  Local residents call them "Mockingbird groupies", and although Lee is not reclusive, she refuses publicity and interviews with an emphatic "Hell no".<ref>{{cite news|last=Pressley|first=Sue|title=Quiet Author, Home Town Attract 'Groupies,' Press; To Live With 'Mockingbird'|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=[[1999-06-10]]|page=A.3}}</ref>
