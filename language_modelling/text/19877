[[File:Hubert Pierlot and Robert Sturges.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hubert Pierlot]] ''(left)'', Prime Minister of the Government in Exile, April 1944.]]
The '''Belgian Government in London''' ({{lang-fr|links=no|Gouvernement belge <U+00E0> Londres}}, {{lang-nl|links=no|Belgische regering in Londen}}), also known as the '''Pierlot IV Government''', was the [[government in exile]] of [[Belgium]] between October 1940 and September 1944. After the invasion of Belgium by [[Nazi Germany]] in May 1940, the Belgian government, under Prime Minister [[Hubert Pierlot]], fled first to [[Bordeaux]] in [[French Third Republic|France]] and then to [[London]], where it established itself as the only legitimate representation of Belgium to the [[Allies (World War II)|Allies]]. Despite no longer having official authority in its own country, the government administered the [[Belgian Congo]] and held negotiations with other Allied powers about post-war reconstruction. It also exercised influence within the [[Free Belgian Forces|Belgian army-in-exile]] and attempted to maintain links with the [[Belgian Resistance|resistance in the occupied country]]. The government was [[tripartite]], involving ministers from the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic]], [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal]] and [[Belgian Labour Party|Labour Parties]].

==Background==
{{main|Battle of Belgium}}
Politically, Belgian politics had been dominated in the interwar period by the [[Catholic Party (Belgium)|Catholic Party]], usually in coalition with the [[Belgian Labour Party]] (POB-BWP) or the [[Liberal Party (Belgium)|Liberal Party]]. The 1930s also saw the rise in popularity of Fascist parties within Belgium; most notably [[Rexism|Rex]] which peaked at the [[Belgian general election, 1936|1936 election]] with 11% of the vote.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonney|first=Richard|title=Confronting the Nazi war on Christianity: the Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936<U+2013>1939|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3-03911-904-2|pages=175<U+2013>6|coauthors=}}</ref> From the early 1930s, Belgian foreign and domestic policy had been dominated by the policy of neutrality; leaving international treaties and alliances and attempting to maintain good diplomatic relations with both [[British Empire|Britain]], France and Germany.{{cn|date = July 2013}}

Nevertheless, Belgium was invaded without warning by German forces on 10 May 1940. After [[Battle of Belgium|18 days of fighting]], the Belgian military surrendered on 28 May and the country was placed under the control of a German military government. Between 600,000<ref name=LS1>{{cite news|last=Bailly|first=Michel|title=Forces et faiblesses de l'arm<U+00E9>e belge en 1940 <U+00E0> la veille de la guerre|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/forces-et-faiblesses-de-l-armee-belge-en-1940-a-la-veil_t-19900202-Z02C79.html|accessdate=17 January 2013|newspaper=[[Le Soir]]|date=2 February 1990}}</ref> and 650,000<ref name=vdmeiren1>{{cite web|title=The Campaign of the Belgian army in May 1940|url=http://home.scarlet.be/vdmeiren/The%20Campaign%20of%20the%20Belgian%20army%20in%20May%201940.html|publisher=home.scarlet.be/vdmeiren|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population)<ref name=woh1>{{cite web|title=Holland: The army and the interbellum|url=http://www.waroverholland.nl/index.php?page=holland-the-army-and-the-interbellum|publisher=Waroverholland.nl|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> had been mobilized to fight. Most were made prisoners of war and detained in [[Stalag|camps]] in Germany.{{cn|date = July 2013}}

Unlike the [[Netherlands]] or [[Luxembourg]], whose monarchies went into exile alongside the government, King [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] surrendered to the Germans alongside his army <U+2013> contrary to the advice of his government. In the days before his surrender, he allegedly attempted to form a new government under the pro-Nazi socialist [[Henri De Man]] though this was never realized.<ref name=Yapou1/> He remained a prisoner of the Germans, under house arrest, for the rest of the war.<ref name=Yapou1>{{cite book|last=Yapou|first=Eliezer|title=Governments in Exile, 1939<U+2013>1945|year=2006|location=Jerusalem|url=http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html|chapter=Belgium: Disintegration and Resurrection}}</ref>

==Establishment in London==
[[File:Eaton Square, London SW1W - geograph.org.uk - 1109683.jpg|thumb|The north side of [[Eaton Square]] in London where the government was established in 1940 and remained until September 1944.]]
While the government under Pierlot was still in Bordeaux, the Belgian Minister of Health, [[Marcel-Henri Jaspar]], arrived in London on 21 June. Jaspar believed that the Pierlot government intended to surrender to the Germans, and was determined to prevent it. Jaspar held talks with [[Charles De Gaulle]], and on 23 June gave a speech on [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio, in which he stated that he was personally forming an alternative government to continue the fight.<ref name=Yapou1/> His stance was condemned by the Pierlot government in Bordeaux, and he was received coldly by the Belgian ambassador in London, [[Emile de Cartier de Marchienne]].<ref name=Yapou1/> Jaspar, joined by the Socialist ''[[burgomaster]]'' of [[Antwerp]] [[Camille Huysmans]], along with other so-called "London Rebels" formed their own government on 5 July 1940.<ref name=Yapou1/> The British, however, were reluctant to recognize the Jaspar-Huysmans Government.<ref name=Yapou1/>

The challenge to the Pierlot government's authority spurred it into action.<ref name=Yapou1/> [[Albert de Vleeschauwer]], Pierlot's Minister of the Colonies, arrived in London on the same day as the Jaspar-Huysmans government was formed.<ref name=Yapou1/> As the only Belgian minister with legal power outside Belgium itself, De Vleeschauwer, together with [[Camille Gutt]] who arrived soon after, was able to form a temporary "Government of Two" with British approval in London, while they waited for [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] and Pierlot, who had been detained in [[Francoist Spain]] ''en route'' from France, to join them.<ref name=Yapou1/> Pierlot and Spaak reached London on 22 October 1940, marking the start of the period of the "Government of Four", providing the "official" government with great legitimacy.<ref name=Yapou1/>

The British were distrustful of many of the Belgian ministers, as well as the size and legitimacy of the government itself. However, with the arrival of the Prime Minister, it was reluctantly accepted:

{{cquote|The present Belgian government is a rump, but it is, as I understand it, a rump of unquestioned lineage, so to speak.|author=[[Alexander Cadogan]], [[Permanent Secretary|Permanent Under-Secretary]] at the British [[Foreign Office#The Foreign Office|Foreign Office]], December 1940<ref>FO 371/24277<U+2013>C13459, Cadogan minute, December 18, 1940</ref>|}}

The bulk of the Belgian government was installed in [[Eaton Square]] in the [[Belgravia]] area of London, which before the war had been the location of the Belgian Embassy. Other government departments were installed in nearby Hobart Place, [[Belgrave Square]] and [[Knightsbridge]].<ref name=Laporte1>{{cite news|last=Laporte|first=Christian|title=Quatre ans <U+00E0> Londres: Eaton Square, Petite Belgique|url=http://archives.lesoir.be/quatre-ans-a-londres-eaton-square-petite-belgique_t-19940901-Z08GC1.html|accessdate=7 July 2013|newspaper=[[Le Soir]]|date=1 September 1994}}</ref> The offices of the Belgian government were situated close to other governments-in-exile, including [[Luxembourgish government-in-exile|Luxembourg]], in [[Wilton Crescent]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome|url=http://londres.mae.lu/en/Welcome|publisher=Embassy of Luxembourg in London|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> and [[Dutch government-in-exile|the Netherlands]] in [[Picadilly]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Plaque: Netherlands Government in exile|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/netherlands-government-in-exile|publisher=London Remembers|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

By December 1940, the British recognized the "government of four" as the legal representation of Belgium, with the same status as the other governments in exile:
{{cquote|[[Churchill war ministry|His Majesty's Government]] do regard the four Belgian ministers composing the Belgian Government in London as the legitimate and constitutional Government of Belgium and competent to exercise ''full authority'' in the name of the Sovereign State of Belgium.<ref name=Talmon130/>}}

==Composition==
Initially numbering just four ministers, the government was soon joined by numerous others. The government in exile comprised both politicians and civil servants in a number of government departments. Most were focused in the Ministries of the Colonies, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Defence, but with skeleton staff in a number of others.<ref name=Conway55-6/> By May 1941, there were nearly 750 people working in the government in London in all capacities.<ref name=Conway55-6>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940<U+2013>45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1571815031|pages=55<U+2013>6|edition=1st|coauthors=Gotovitch, Jos<U+00E9> (eds.)}}</ref>

==Role==
The Government in Exile was expected to fulfill the functions of a national government, but also represent Belgian interest to the Allied powers, leading [[Paul-Henri Spaak]] to comment that "all that remains of legal and free Belgium, all that is entitled to speak in her name, is in London".<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Belgium Fights On: Civilisation will Perish if Nazis Win|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/25851926|accessdate=7 May 2013|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart){{!}}The Mercury]]|date=13 March 1941}}</ref>

===Belgian refugees===
One of the most pressing concerns facing the government in exile in 1940 was the situation of Belgian refugees in the United Kingdom. By 1940, at least 15,000 Belgian civilians had arrived in the United Kingdom, many of them without their possessions.<ref name=Conway61/> The refugees had originally been dealt with by the British government, however in September 1940, the government established a Central Service of Refugees to provide material assistance and employment for Belgians in Britain.<ref name=Conway57-8>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940<U+2013>45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1571815031|pages=57<U+2013>8|edition=1st|coauthors=Gotovitch, Jos<U+00E9> (eds.)}}</ref>

The British public was exceptionally hostile to Belgian refugees in 1940, because of the belief that Belgium had betrayed the Allies in 1940.<ref name=church1>{{cite web|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Feeding the Crocodile: Was Leopold Guilty?|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour/issues-109-to-144/no-138/898-feeding-the-crocodile-was-leopold-guilty|publisher=Churchill Centre|accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> A British [[Mass Observation]] report noted a "growing feeling against Belgian refugees" in the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite book|last=Crang, Jeremy A.|first=Addison, Paul|title=Listening to Britain: Home Intelligence Reports on Britain's Finest Hour, May<U+2013>September 1940|year=2011|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=0099548747|pages=71; 56}}</ref> closely linked to Leopold's decision to surrender.<ref>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940<U+2013>45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1571815031|page=54|edition=1st|coauthors=Gotovitch, Jos<U+00E9> (eds.)}}</ref>

The government was also involved in the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to Belgian refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of the [[Anglo-Belgian Club|Belgian Institute]] in London to entertain the Belgian refugee community in London.<ref name=Conway55-6/> By 1943, there were also four Belgian schools in Britain with 330 pupils between them, in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], [[Braemar]], [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]] and [[Buxton]].<ref name=Conway60>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940<U+2013>45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1571815031|page=60|edition=1st|coauthors=Gotovitch, Jos<U+00E9> (eds.)}}</ref>

===Free Belgian forces===

{{main|Free Belgian Forces}}
In a broadcast on French Radio, shortly after the Belgian surrender, Pierlot called for the creation of an army-in-exile to continue the fight:

{{cquote|With the same youthful courage that responded to the government's call, reunited with the elements of the Belgian military in France and Great Britain, a new army will be levied and organized. It will go into the line alongside those of our allies&nbsp;... all the forces we have will be put at the service of the cause which has become ours&nbsp;... It is important to assure immediately and in a tangible way, the solidarity which continues to unite the powers which have given us their support&nbsp;... |author=Pierlot's speech on French Radio, 28 May 1940<ref>{{cite book|last=Gerard, Emmanuel; Van Nieuwenhuyse, Karel (eds.)|first=|title=Scripta Politica: Politieke Geschiedenis van Belgi<U+00EB> in Documenten, 1918<U+2013>2008|year=2010|publisher=Acco|location=Leuven|isbn=978-90-334-8039-3|edition=2nd|pages=164<U+2013>5}}</ref>|}}

With some Belgian troops rescued from [[Dunkirk]] during [[Operation Dynamo]], as well as Belgian <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9>s already living in England, the government-in-exile approved the creation of an "Belgian Military Camp for Regrouping" (CMBR) in [[Tenby]], Wales.<ref name=BP1/> By July 1940, the camp numbered 462 Belgians, rising to nearly 700 by August 1940.<ref name=BP1>{{cite web|title=La Brigade Piron: Cr<U+00E9>ation en Grande-Bretagne|url=http://www.brigade-piron.be/creation_fr.html|publisher=Brigade-piron.be|accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> These soldiers were organized into the 1st Fusilier Battalion in August, and the government appointed Lieutenant-Generals [[Raoul Daufresne de la Chevalerie]] as commander, and [[Victor van Strydonck de Burkel]] as inspector-general of the new force.<ref name=Thomas15-6>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Nigel|title=Foreign Volunteers of the Allied Forces, 1939<U+2013>45|year=1991|publisher=Osprey|location=London|isbn=978-1-85532-136-6|pages=15<U+2013>6}}</ref> The government was later able to successfully lobby for the creation of a Belgian Section within the [[Royal Navy]], as well as the creation of two all-Belgian squadrons within the [[Royal Air Force]].

For the first years of the war, a degree of tension existed between the government and the army, which divided its allegiance between government and king. The Free Belgian forces, particular the infantry who had been training since 1940, held the government responsible for not being allowed to fight. In November 1942, 12 Belgian soldiers mutinied, complaining about their inactivity.<ref name=Conway92/> By 1943, the army's royalist stance had been moderated, allowing the government to re-gain the support of the military.<ref name=Conway94>{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Martin|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain 1940<U+2013>45|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1571815031|page=94|edition=1st|coauthors=Gotovitch, Jos<U+00E9> (eds.)}}</ref>

===Treaties and negotiations===
[[File:Original United Nations.jpg|175px|thumb|right|Poster depicting the flags of the "United Nations", including Belgium, that signed the [[Declaration by United Nations|Declaration of 1942]].]]
In September 1941, the Belgian government signed the [[Atlantic Charter]] in London alongside other governments in exile, presenting the common goals which the Allies sought to achieve after the war.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inter-Allied Council Statement on the Principles of the Atlantic Charter: September 24, 1941 [Text]|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/interall.asp|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> A year later, the government signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] in January 1942, with 26 other nations, which would set a precedent for the foundation of the [[United Nations|United Nations Organisation]] in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|title=Declaration by the United Nations, January 1, 1942 [Text]|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/decade03.asp|publisher=[[Yale University]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

From 1944, the Allies became increasingly concerned with laying the framework of post-war Europe. These were formalized through numerous treaties and agreements from 1944. In July 1944, Camille Gutt attended the [[Bretton Woods Conference]] in the United States on behalf of the Belgian government, establishing the [[Bretton Woods System]] of currency controls. During the negotiations, Gutt served as an important intermediary between the delegates of the major Allied powers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Crombois|first=Jean F.|title=Camille Gutt and Postwar International Finance|year=2011|publisher=Pickering & Chatto|location=London|isbn=9781848930582|page=107}}</ref> Through the agreements, the Belgian Franc's exchange rate would be tied to the [[United States Dollar|American Dollar]] after the war, while he conference also established the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) of which Gutt would serve as the first director.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bretton Woods Institutions|url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/doc/infosheets/fiche_information_EN_19.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[National Bank of Belgium]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

In September 1944, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourgish governments in exile began formulating an agreement over the creation of a [[Benelux|Benelux Customs Union]].<ref name=Walsh1>{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Jeremy|title=Benelux Economic Union <U+2013> A New Role for the 21st Century|url=http://martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/sites/martindale.cc.lehigh.edu/files/BeneluxEconomy.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=[[Lehigh University]]}}</ref> The agreement was signed in the [[London Customs Convention]] on 5 September 1944, just days before the Belgian government returned to [[Brussels]] after the liberation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty Establishing the Benelux Economic Union (1958)|url=http://www.cris.unu.edu/riks/web/treaties/Benelux.pdf|publisher=[[United Nations University]]|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref> The Benelux Customs Union was a major extension of [[Belgium<U+2013>Luxembourg Economic Union|a pre-war union]] between Belgium and Luxembourg, and would later form the basis of the ''Benelux Economic Union'' from 1958.<ref name=Walsh1/>

==Authority==
Unlike many other governments in exile, which were forced to rely exclusively on financial support from the Allies, the Belgian government in exile could fund itself independently. In large part, this was due to the Belgian national gold reserves, which had been moved to Britain, and provided an important asset.<ref name=Buyst>{{cite news|last=Erik|first=Buyst|title=Camille Gutt and Postwar International Finance|url=http://eh.net/book_reviews/camille-gutt-and-postwar-international-finance|accessdate=13 July 2013|newspaper=EH.Net|date=November 2011}}</ref> The Belgian government was also in control of the [[Belgian Congo]], which exported large amounts of raw materials (including [[Natural rubber|rubber]], [[gold]] and [[uranium]]) which the Allies relied on for the war effort.<ref name=Buyst/>

==Stances==
===Relations with Leopold III===
{{see also|Leopold III of Belgium}}
Despite being a constitutional monarch, the King of the Belgians had occupied an important political role within Belgium before the war. The decision of Leopold III to surrender to the Germans <U+2013> without consulting his own ministers <U+2013> outraged the Belgian cabinet.<ref name=Yapou1/> The King's apparent opposition to it undermined its credibility and legitimacy. For the first years of the war, the King was viewed as an alternative source of "government" by many, including figures in the Free Belgian military, which served to further undermine the official government in London. Later in the war, the government changed its position to be less belligerent towards the king.<ref name=Yapou1/> Belgian propaganda of the time instead emphasized the King's position as "martyr" and prisoner-of-war and presented him as sharing the same sufferings as the occupied country.<ref name=Yapou1/>

According to the [[Constitution of Belgium|Constitution of 1831]], the Belgian government was allowed to override the wishes of the King if he had been declared incompetent to reign.<ref name=Talmon150-1/> On 28 May 1940, the Pierlot government in France had declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and unfit to reign, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government.<ref name=Talmon150-1>{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law, with particular reference to Governments in Exile|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199248391|pages=150<U+2013>1|edition=Reprint.}}</ref> Although the King was technically the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.<ref name=Talmon130>{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law, with particular reference to Governments in Exile|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199248391|page=130|edition=Reprint.}}</ref>

===Relations with the Resistance===
[[File:Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945. CL3987.jpg|thumb|Supplies for the Resistance dropped by British aircraft in the countryside north of [[Brussels]].]]
{{see also|Belgian Resistance}}
The Belgian government of Jaspar-Huysmans called for the creation of organized resistance in occupied Belgium from London, even before the [[Battle of France#Surrender and armistice|French surrender]]:

{{cquote|We trust fully in the power of Britain to deliver us from German bondage&nbsp;... We claim the right to share in the burden and honour of this fight in the measure of our modest, but not altogether negligible, resources. We are not defeatists&nbsp;...|author=Huysmans in radio broadcast, 23 June 1940<ref name=Yapou1>{{cite book|last=Yapou|first=Elizer|title=Governments in Exile, 1939<U+2013>1945|year=1998|location=Jerusalem|url=http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html|chapter=4: Belgium: Disintegration and Resurection}}</ref>}}

The government succeeded in obtaining control over British French-language radio broadcasts, {{lang|fr|''Radio Belgique''}}, to occupied Belgium. The radio station was essential for keeping the resistance and public alike informed, and was placed under the control of [[Paul M. G. L<U+00E9>vy|Paul L<U+00E9>vy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Grosbois|first=Thierry|title=Pierlot, 1930<U+2013>1950|year=1998|location=Brussels|publisher=Racine|isbn=2873864850|pages=184<U+2013>7}}</ref> Amongst those working in the radio was [[Victor de Laveleye]], a former Belgian Minister who served as an announcer, who is credited for inventing the "[[V sign#The V for Victory campaign and the victory-freedom sign|V for Victory]]" campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=V-Campaign|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050312223729/http://home.luna.nl/~arjan-muil/radio/history/ww-2/v-campaign.html|publisher=Virtual Radio Museum|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the apparent isolation of the government-in-exile from the day-to-day situation in Belgium meant that it was viewed with suspicion by many resistance groups, particularly those whose politics different from the established government. The government, for its part, was afraid that resistance groups would turn into ungovernable political militias after liberation, challenging the government's position and threatening political stability.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Bob (ed.)|title=Resistance in Western Europe|year=2000|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85973-274-7|page=54|edition=1st}}</ref> Nevertheless, the resistance was frequently reliant on finance and drops of equipment and supplies which both the government-in-exile and the British [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) were able to provide.<ref name=DeVidts89-90>{{cite journal|last=De Vidts|first=Kim|title=Belgium: A Small but Significant Resistance Force during World War II|journal=MA Thesis|url=http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/History/GraduateDegree/MADMSTheses/files/2004KimdeVidts.pdf|format=PDF|year=2004|pages=89<U+2013>90|location=Hawaii Pacific University}}</ref> During the course of the war, the government-in-exile delivered between 124<U+2013>245 million [[Belgian Franc|francs]], dropped by parachute or transferred via bank accounts in [[Portugal in World War II|neutral Portugal]], to the {{lang|fr|''[[Arm<U+00E9>e secr<U+00E8>te (Belgium)|Arm<U+00E9>e Secr<U+00E8>te]]''}} group alone, with smaller sums also distributed to other organisations.<ref name=DeVidts89-90/>

In the early years of the war, contact with the government exile was difficult to establish. The {{lang|fr|''[[L<U+00E9>gion Belge (resistance)|L<U+00E9>gion Belge]]''}} dispatched a member to try to establish contact in May 1941, it took a full year to reach London.<ref name=DeVidts89-90/> Radio contact was briefly established in late 1941, however, the contact was extremely intermittent between 1942 and 1943, with a permanent radio connection to the {{lang|fr|''Arm<U+00E9>e Secr<U+00E8>te''}} (codenamed "Stanley") only established in 1944.<ref name=DeVidts89-90/>

In May 1944, the government-in-exile attempted to rebuild its relationship with the resistance by establishing a "Coordination Committee" of representatives of the major groups, including the ''L<U+00E9>gion Belge'', ''[[Belgian National Movement|Mouvement National Belge]]'', ''[[Groupe G]]'' and the ''[[Front de l'Ind<U+00E9>pendance]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Bob (ed.)|title=Resistance in Western Europe|year=2000|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=1-85973-274-7|page=53|edition=1st}}</ref> However, the committee was rendered redundant by the liberation in September.

On 26 September, Pierlot formed a new government of [[National unity government|national unity]] (Pierlot V) in Brussels. The new government included many of the ministers (including all of the "four") from London, but for the first time also including the [[Communist Party of Belgium|Communists]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Le gouvernement Pierlot V (1944)|url=http://www.histoire-des-belges.be/listes/les-gouvernements-de-la-belgique-unitaire/gouvernement-pierlot-v-1944|publisher=Histoire-des-belges.be|accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> In December 1944, a new triparate government was formed, with Pierlot still as Prime Minister. In 1945, having been Prime Minister since 1939, Pierlot was finally replaced by [[Achille Van Acker]].

The government in exile was one of the last governments in which the traditional parties which had dominated Belgium since its creation were still present. In 1945, the POB-BWP changed its name to the [[Belgian Socialist Party]] (PSB-BSP) and the Catholic Party became the [[Christian Social Party (Belgium, defunct)|Christian Social Party]] (PSC-CVP).
