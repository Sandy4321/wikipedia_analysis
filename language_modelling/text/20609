The drug '''aprotinin''' (Trasylol, [[Bayer]]), is the bovine version of the small protein '''basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor''', or '''BPTI''', which inhibits [[trypsin]] and related proteolytic [[enzyme]]s. Under the trade name '''Trasylol''', aprotinin was used as a [[medication]] administered by [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] to reduce [[bleeding]] during complex [[surgery]], such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of [[fibrinolysis]], the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for [[blood transfusion]]s during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death;<ref>{{cite press release |title=Bayer Temporarily Suspends Global Trasylol Marketing |publisher=Trasylol.com |date=2007-11-05 |url=http://www.trasylol.com/Trasylol_11_05_07.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol was entirely and permanently withdrawn in May 2008, except for very restricted research use.

The high stability of the molecule is due to the 3 [[disulfide bond]]s linking the 6 [[cysteine]] members of the chain (Cys5-Cys55, Cys14-Cys38 and Cys30-Cys51).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kassell B, Laskowski M |title=The basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas.

BPTI is synthesized as a longer, precursor sequence, which folds up and then is cleaved into the mature sequence given above.

BPTI is the classic member of the protein family of [[Kunitz-type protease inhibitor|Kunitz-type]] [[serine protease inhibitor]]s.  Its physiological functions include the protective inhibition of the major digestive enzyme trypsin when small amounts are produced by cleavage of the trypsinogen precursor during storage in the pancreas.

==Mechanism of drug action==
Aprotinin inhibits several [[serine protease]]s, specifically [[trypsin]], [[chymotrypsin]] and [[plasmin]] at a concentration of about 125,000 IU/ml, and [[kallikrein]] at 300,000 IU/ml.<ref name=Mahdy/> Its action on [[kallikrein]] leads to the inhibition of the formation of [[factor XII]]a. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis.<ref name=Mannucci/>

==Drug efficacy==
In cardiac surgery with a high risk of significant blood loss, aprotinin significantly reduced bleeding, mortality and hospital stay.<ref name=Mahdy/> Beneficial effects were also reported in high-risk orthopedic surgery.<ref name=Mahdy/> In [[liver transplantation]], initial reports of benefit were overshadowed by concerns about toxicity.<ref name=Xia>{{cite journal |author=Xia VW, Steadman RH |title=Antifibrinolytics in orthotopic liver transplantation: current status and controversies |journal=Liver Transpl. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=10<U+2013>8 |year=2005 |pmid=15690531 |doi=10.1002/lt.20275}}</ref>

==Drug safety==
There have been concerns about the safety of aprotinin.<ref name=Mahdy/> [[Anaphylaxis]] (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but [[serology]] (measuring antibodies against aprotinin in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult.<ref name=Mahdy/>

[[Thrombosis]], presumably from overactive inhibition of the fibrinolytic system, may occur at a higher rate, but until 2006 there was limited evidence for this association.<ref name=Mahdy/><ref name=Sedrakyan/> Similarly, while biochemical measures of renal function were known to occasionally deteriorate, there was no evidence that this greatly influenced outcomes.<ref name=Mahdy/> A study performed in cardiac surgery patients reported in 2006 showed that there was indeed a risk of [[acute renal failure]], [[myocardial infarction]] and [[heart failure]], as well as [[stroke]] and [[encephalopathy]].<ref name=Mangano>{{cite journal |author=Mangano DT, Tudor IC, Dietzel C |title=The risk associated with aprotinin in cardiac surgery |journal=N.

In September 2006, Bayer A.G. was faulted by the FDA for not revealing during testimony the existence of a commissioned retrospective study of 67,000 patients, 30,000 of whom received aprotinin and the rest other anti-fibrinolytics. The study concluded aprotinin carried greater risks. The FDA was alerted to the study by one of the researchers involved. Although the FDA issued a statement of concern they did not change their recommendation that the drug may benefit certain subpopulations of patients.<ref>{{cite news |author=Gardiner Harris|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/health/30fda.html |title=F.D.A.

On October 25, 2007, the FDA issued a statement regarding the "Blood conservation using antifibrinolytics" (BART) randomized trial in a cardiac surgery population. The preliminary findings suggest that, compared to other antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) aprotinin may increase the risk of death.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/early_comm/aprotinin.htm | title = Early Communication about an Ongoing Safety Review Aprotinin Injection (marketed as Trasylol) | accessdate = 2007-10-28 | author = U.S. Food and Drug Administration |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071030053834/http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/early_comm/aprotinin.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-30}}</ref>  On October 29, 2006 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that aprotinin may have serious kidney and cardiovascular toxicity.

One study found an increased risk in need for dialysis and revascularisation.<ref name=Schneewiss/>

No cases of [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] transmission by aprotinin have been reported, although the drug was withdrawn in Italy due to fears of this.<ref name=Mahdy/>

==In vitro use==
Small amounts of aprotinin can be added to tubes of drawn blood to enable laboratory measurement of certain rapidly degraded proteins such as [[glucagon]].

In cell biology aprotinin is used as an [[enzyme inhibitor]] to prevent protein [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] during [[lysis]] or [[Homogenization (biology)|homogenization]] of cells and tissues.

Aprotinin can be labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate.

Initially named "kallikrein inactivator", aprotinin was first isolated from cow [[parotid gland]]s in 1930.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1515/bchm2.1930.192.1-3.1|year=1930|author=Kraut H, Frey EK, Bauer E|title=<U+00DC>ber die Inaktivierung des kallikreins | language=German|journal=Hoppe-Seyler's Z Physiol Chem|volume=192|pages=1&ndash;21}}</ref> and independently as a trypsin inhibitor from bovine pancreas in 1936.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kunitz M, Northrup J|year=1936|title=Isolation from beef pancreas of crystalline trypsinogen, trypsin, trypsin inhibitor, and an inhibitor trypsin compound|journal=J Gen Physiol|volume=19|pages=991&ndash;1007|url=http://www.jgp.org/cgi/reprint/19/6/991|doi=10.1085/jgp.19.6.991}}</ref> It was purified from bovine lung in 1964.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kraut H, Bhargava N |title=Versuche zur Isolierung des Kallikrein-Inaktivators aus Rinderlunge and seine Identifizierung mit dem Inaktivator aus Rinderparotis |language=German |journal=Hoppe-Seyler's Z.

BPTI is one of the most thoroughly studied proteins in terms of [[structural biology]], experimental and computational dynamics, mutagenesis, and [[protein folding|folding pathway]]. It was one of the earliest protein crystal structures solved, in 1970 in the laboratory of [[Robert Huber]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Huber, R., et al.|title=The Basic Trypsin Inhibitor of Bovine Pancreas.

Structure Analysis and Conformation of the Polypeptide Chain |year=1970 |journal= Naturwissenschaften |volume=57| pages=389<U+2013>92|pmid=5447861|issue=8 }}</ref> and was the first protein to have its [[protein structure|structure]] determined by [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], in the laboratory of [[Kurt Wuthrich]] at the ETH in Zurich in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wagner, G. and Wuthrich, K.|title=Sequential resonance assignments in protein 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra: basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor|year=1982|journal= Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=155|pages=347<U+2013>366 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(82)90009-2 |pmid=6176717 |issue=3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Havel, T.F. and Wuthrich, K. |title= An evaluation of the combined use of nuclear magnetic resonance and distance geometry for the determination of protein conformations in solution |year=1985 |journal= Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=182 |pages= 281<U+2013>294 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(85)90346-8 |pmid=2582141 |issue=2 }}</ref> 

Because it is a small, stable protein whose structure had been determined at high resolution by 1975,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Deisenhofer, J. and Steigemann, W. |title= Crystallographic Refinement of the Structure of Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor at 1.5 Angstroms Resolution |year=1975 |journal=Acta Crystallographica B |volume=31 |pages=238 |doi=10.1107/S0567740875002415 }}</ref> it was the first macromolecule of scientific interest to be simulated using [[molecular dynamics]] computation, in 1977 by [[J. Andrew McCammon]] and Bruce Gelin, in the [[Martin Karplus|Karplus]] group at Harvard.<ref>{{cite journal |author=McCammon JA, Gelin BR, Karplus M |title=Dynamics of folded proteins |journal=Nature |volume=267 |issue=5612 |pages=585<U+2013>90 |year=1977 |pmid=301613 |doi=10.1038/267585a0}}</ref> That study confirmed the then-surprising fact found in the NMR work<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wuthrich, K. and Wagner, G. | title=NMR investigations of the dynamics of the aromatic amino acid residues in the basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor |year=1975 |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=50 |pages=265<U+2013>268 |doi=10.1016/0014-5793(75)80504-7 |pmid=234403 |issue=2 }}</ref> that even well-packed aromatic sidechains in the interior of a stable protein can flip over rather rapidly (microsecond to millisecond time scale). Rate constants were determined by NMR for the hydrogen exchange of individual peptide NH groups along the chain, ranging from too fast to measure on the most exposed surface to many months for the most buried hydrogen-bonded groups in the center of the <U+03B2> sheet, and those values also correlate fairly well with degree of motion seen in the dyamics simulations.

BPTI was important in the development of knowledge about the process of [[protein folding]], the self-assembly of a polypeptide chain into a specific arrangement in 3D.  The problem of achieving the correct pairings among the 6 Cys sidechains was shown to be especially difficult for the two buried, close-together SS near the BPTI chain termini, requiring a non-native intermediate for folding the mature sequence ''in vitro'' (it was later discovered that the precursor sequence folds more easily ''in vivo''). BPTI was the cover image on a protein folding compendium volume by [[Thomas Creighton]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas E. Creighton |title= Protein Folding |year= 1992 |publisher= W. H.
