==Plot==
The governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert "Happy" Hopper ([[Guy Kibbee]]), has to pick a replacement for recently deceased [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] Sam Foley. His corrupt [[political boss]], Jim Taylor ([[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]]), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith ([[James Stewart]]), the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge <U+2013> and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments <U+2013> he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his [[na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9>]] will make him easy to manipulate.

Junior Senator Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine ([[Claude Rains]]), who was Smith's late father's friend. Smith develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan ([[Astrid Allwyn]]). At Senator Paine's home, Smith has a conversation with Susan, fidgeting and bumbling, entranced by the young socialite. Smith's na<U+00EF>ve and honest nature allows the unforgiving Washington press to take advantage of him, quickly tarnishing Smith's reputation with ridiculous front page pictures and headlines branding him a [[yokel|bumpkin]].

To keep Smith busy, Paine suggests he propose a bill. With the help of his secretary, Clarissa Saunders ([[Jean Arthur]]), who was the aide to Smith's predecessor and had been around Washington and politics for years, Smith comes up with a bill to authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a dam-building [[graft (politics)|graft]] scheme included in an appropriations bill framed by the Taylor "[[machine (politics)|political machine]]" and supported by Senator Paine.

Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence. Through Paine, the machine in his state accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by producing fraudulent evidence that Smith already owns the land in question. Smith is too shocked by Paine's betrayal to defend himself, and runs away.

Saunders, who looked down on Smith at first, but has come to believe in him, talks him into launching a [[filibuster]] to postpone the appropriations bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. In his last chance to prove his innocence, he talks non-stop for about 24 hours, reaffirming the American ideals of freedom and disclosing the true motives of the dam scheme. Yet none of the Senators are convinced.

The constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Owing to the influence of Taylor's machine, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state, on Taylor's orders, refuse to report what Smith has to say and even distort the facts against the senator. An effort by the Boy Rangers to spread the news in support of Smith results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's minions.

Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state, purportedly from average people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate ([[Harry Carey (actor born 1878)|Harry Carey]]). Smith vows to press on until people believe him, but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with guilt, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to commit suicide, but is stopped by other senators. When he is stopped, he bursts back into the Senate chamber, loudly confessing to the whole scheme; that he should be expelled from the Senate, and affirms Smith's innocence.

==Production==
[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer.JPG|thumb|[[James Stewart]]]]
[[Columbia Pictures]] originally purchased [[Lewis R. Foster]]'s unpublished story, variously called ''The Gentleman from Montana'' and ''The Gentleman from Wyoming'', as a vehicle for [[Ralph Bellamy]], but once [[Frank Capra]] came on board as director&nbsp;<U+2013> after [[Rouben Mamoulian]] had expressed interest&nbsp;<U+2013> the film was to be a sequel to his ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'', called ''Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington'', with [[Gary Cooper]] reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds.{{#tag:ref| Lewis Foster later testified during a lawsuit that he had written the story specifically with Gary Cooper in mind.<ref name=tcmnote/> |group=N}} Because Cooper was unavailable, Capra then "saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur",<ref>Sennett 1989, p. 173.</ref> and Stewart was borrowed from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]].<ref name=tcmnote /> Capra said of Stewart: "I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith... He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him."<ref name=tcmart>Tatara, Paul. [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3771&category=Articles "''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''."] ''TCM article''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref>

Although a youth group is featured in the story, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] refused to allow their name to be used in the film and instead the fanciful "Boy Rangers" was used.<ref name=tcmnote/>

In January 1938, both [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] had submitted Foster's story to the censors at the [[Hays Office]], probably indicating that both studios had interest in the project before Columbia purchased it. [[Joseph Breen]], the head of that office, warned the studios: "[W]e would urge most earnestly that you take serious counsel before embarking on the production of any motion picture based on this story. It looks to us like one that might well be loaded with dynamite, both for the motion picture industry, and for the country at large." Breen specifically objected to "the generally unflattering portrayal of our system of Government, which might well lead to such a picture being considered, both here, and more particularly abroad, as a covert attack on the Democratic form of government". and warned that the film should make clear that "the Senate is made up of a group of fine, upstanding citizens, who labor long and tirelessly for the best interests of the nation..."

Later, after the screenplay had been written and submitted, Breen reversed course, saying of the film that "It is a grand yarn that will do a great deal of good for all those who see it and, in my judgment, it is particularly fortunate that this kind of story is to be made at this time. Out of all Senator Jeff's difficulties there has been evolved the importance of a democracy and there is splendidly emphasized the rich and glorious heritage which is ours and which comes when you have a government 'of the people, by the people, and for the people'<ref name=tcmnote />".

The film was in production from April 3, 1939 to July 7 of that year.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3771 "Overview."] ''TCM''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref> Some location shooting took place in [[Washington, DC]], at [[Union Station (Washington)|Union Station]] and at the [[United States Capitol]], as well as other locations for background use.<ref>Rosales 2003, pp. 102, 117, 124.</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031679/locations "Filming locations."] ''IMDB''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref>

In the studio, to ensure authenticity, an elaborate set was created, consisting of Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms, hotel suites as well as specific Washington, DC monuments, all based on a trip Capra and his crew made to the capital. Even the [[National Press Club (USA)|Press Club of Washington]] was reproduced in minute detail,<ref name=tcmnote /><ref>Sennett 1989, p. 175.</ref> but the major effort went into a faithful reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. James D. Preston, a former superintendent of the Senate gallery, acted as technical director for the Senate set, as well as advising on political protocol. The production also utilized the "New York street set" on the [[Warner Bros.]] lot, using 1,000 extras when that scene was shot.<ref name=tcmnote />

The ending of the film was apparently changed at some point, as the original program describes Stewart and Arthur returning to Mr. Smith's hometown, where they are met by a big parade, with the implication that they are married and starting a family.<ref name=tcmnote /> In addition, the Taylor political machine was shown being crushed, Smith, riding a motorcycle, visits Senator Paine and forgives him, and a visit to Smith's mother. Some of this footage can be seen in the film's trailer.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3771&category=Trivia "Trivia."] ''TCM''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref>

==Impact==
When it was first released, the film premiered in [[Constitution Hall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on October 17, 1939, sponsored by the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]], an event to which 4,000 guests were invited, including 45 senators.<ref name=tcmart /> ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' was attacked by the Washington press, and politicians in the [[U.S. Congress]], as [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] and pro-[[communism|Communist]] for its portrayal of corruption in the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]].<ref>Capra 1971, pp. 254<U+2013>266.</ref> While Capra claims in his autobiography that some senators walked out of the premiere, contemporary press accounts are unclear about whether this occurred or not, or whether senators yelled back at the screen during the film.<ref>McBride 1992, pp. 419<U+2013>420.</ref>

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2 crop.JPG|thumb|left|Senator Jefferson Smith addresses inattentive Senators]]
It ''is'' known that [[Alben W. Barkley]], a Democrat and the Senate Majority Leader, called the film <U+201C>silly and stupid<U+201D>, and said it <U+201C>makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks<U+201D>.<ref name="Capra p. 287"/> He also remarked that the film was <U+201C>a grotesque distortion<U+201D> of the Senate, <U+201C>as grotesque as anything ever seen! Imagine the Vice President of the United States winking at a pretty girl in the gallery in order to encourage a filibuster!<U+201D> Barkley thought the film <U+201C>...showed the Senate as the biggest aggregation of nincompoops on record!<U+201D><ref name="Capra p. 287">Capra 1971, p. 287.</ref>

[[P. S. Harrison|Pete Harrison]], a respected journalist and publisher of the motion picture trade journal, ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'', suggested that the Senate pass a bill allowing theater owners to refuse to show films that <U+201C>were not in the best interest of our country<U+201D>. That did not happen, but one of the ways that some senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the [[Matthew M. Neely|Neely]] Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which put forward the film<U+2019>s patriotism and support of democracy and publicized the film<U+2019>s many positive reviews.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 289.</ref>

Other objections were voiced as well. [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], the American Ambassador to Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head [[Harry Cohn]] to say that he feared the film would damage <U+201C>America<U+2019>s prestige in Europe<U+201D>, and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release. Capra and Cohn responded, citing the film<U+2019>s review, which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he never followed up, although he privately still had doubts about the film.<ref>Capra 1971, p. 292.</ref>

The film was banned in [[Hitler's Germany]], [[Mussolini's Italy]], [[Franco's Spain]] and [[Stalin's USSR]].<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb title|0031679}}</ref><!-- {{unreliable source? --><!-- I don't see how IMDB is a reliable source for the history of the film, and I find it hard to believe that any of these countries would single out this specific film for banning. --> According to Capra, the film was also [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in certain European countries to alter the message of the film so it conformed with official ideology.<ref name=imdb>{{IMDb title|0031679}}</ref>

When a ban on American films was imposed in [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupied France]] in 1942, some theaters chose to show ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' as the last movie before the ban went into effect. One theater owner in [[Paris]] reportedly screened the film nonstop for 30 days after the ban was announced.<ref name= "Smith article">[http://www.reelclassics.com/Movies/MrSmith/mrsmith-article.htm <U+201C>''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' (1939).<U+201D>]  ''ReelClassics.com''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref>

The critical response to the film was more measured than the reaction by politicians, domestic and foreign. The critic for the ''[[New York Times]]'', for instance, [[Frank S. Nugent]], wrote that "[Capra] is operating, of course, under the protection of that unwritten clause in the Bill of Rights entitling every voting citizen to at least one free swing at the Senate. Mr. Capra<U+2019>s swing is from the floor and in the best of humor; if it fails to rock the august body to its heels&nbsp;<U+2014> from laughter as much as from injured dignity&nbsp;<U+2014> it won<U+2019>t be his fault but the Senate<U+2019>s, and we should really begin to worry about the upper house."<ref>Capra 1971, p. 286.</ref>

''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' has been called one of the quintessential [[whistleblower]] films in American history. Dr. James Murtagh and Dr. [[Jeffrey Wigand]] cited this film as a seminal event in U.S. history at the first <U+201C>[[Whistleblower Week in Washington]]<U+201D> (May 13<U+2013>19, 2007).<ref>Miles, Adam and Tom Devine.

Retrieved: January 10, 2010.</ref>

The film has often been listed as among Capra<U+2019>s best, but it has been noted that it <U+201C>marked a turning point in Capra<U+2019>s vision of the world, from nervous optimism to a darker, more pessimistic tone. Beginning with ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932), such Capra films as ''[[Lady for a Day]]'' (1933), ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936), and ''[[You Can't Take It With You (film)|You Can<U+2019>t Take It With You]]'' (1938) had trumpeted their belief in the decency of the common man. In ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'', however, the decent common man is surrounded by a venal, petty and thuggish group of crooks. Everyone in the film <U+2014> except for Jefferson Smith and his tiny cadre of believers <U+2014> is either in the pay of the political machine run by Edward Arnold<U+2019>s James Taylor or complicit in Taylor<U+2019>s corruption through their silence, and they all sit by as innocent people, including children, are brutalized and intimidated, rights are violated, and the government is brought to a halt<U+201D>.<ref>Eder, Bruce. [http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:33698 <U+201C>''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''<U+201D>]{{dead link|date=August 2012}} ''Allmovie review''. Retrieved: June 26, 2009.</ref>

Nevertheless, Smith<U+2019>s filibuster and the tacit encouragement of the Senate President are both emblematic of the director's belief in the difference that one individual can make. This theme would be expanded further in Capra's ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and other films.

==Remakes==
In 1949, Columbia planned, but never actually produced, a sequel to ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'', called ''Mr. Smith Starts a Riot''. They also considered doing a gender-reversed remake in 1952, with [[Jane Wyman]] playing the lead role.<ref name=tcmnote />

A television series of the same name, ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (TV series)|Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the 1962<U+2013>1963 season, starring [[Fess Parker]], [[Sandra Warner]] and [[Red Foley]]. Producer [[Frank Capra, Jr.]] remade the film as part of [[Tom Laughlin (actor)|Tom Laughlin]]'s [[Billy Jack]] series, ''[[Billy Jack Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), but it was not a success. The film was also loosely remade as ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' (1992), starring [[Eddie Murphy]]. The film's influence can be seen on many other films that deal with the [[United States Congress]], including ''[[Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde]]'' and ''[[Evan Almighty]]''. The short-lived NBC political drama ''[[Mister Sterling]]'' (2003) was described as "a ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' for the 21st century", with the show centering on an idealistic young senator from California, coming to grips with Washington and appointed by a scheming, underhanded governor.<ref name=tcmnote />

The VHS release of ''[[Ernest Rides Again]]'' featured the opening Saturday Night Live-based short "Mr. Bill Goes to Washington", a spoof of ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''.

The March 10, 1940 broadcast of [[Jack Benny]]'s NBC radio show featured a parody entitled "Mr. Benny Goes to Washington."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://otr.net/?p=jbny|title=IIS Windows Server|publisher=}}</ref>

''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[Beyond Blunderdome]]'' includes a parodistic, fake remake of ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'', authored by a fictional [[Mel Gibson]] with [[Homer Simpson]]'s help. The fictional remake follows the same plot of the original (save for being set in the 21st century) until the final iconic "[[filibuster]] scene", replaced with a stock action scene in which a nearly exhausted Mr. Smith suddenly stands up and viciously slaughters every single senator, impaling Senator Payne with an American flag, destroying the Senate and beheading the President of the United States, mockingly quoting [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s ''[[Happy Birthday, Mr. President]]''.

''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[Mr. Lisa goes to Washington]]'' is inspired by, and contains several references to ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''. The episode deals with [[Lisa Simpson]]'s disillusionment with Washington government, following her winning a trip to Washington as a prize in an essay contest.
