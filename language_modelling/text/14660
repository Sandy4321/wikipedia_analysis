'''Hatt-i humayun''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: ''' <U+062E><U+0637> <U+0647><U+0645><U+0627><U+064A><U+0648><U+0646>''', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' or ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n''), also known as '''hatt-i sharif''' (Turkish: ''hatt-<U+0131> <U+015F>er<U+00EE>f''), is the [[diplomatics]] term for a document or handwritten note of an official nature composed by an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]]. The terms come from ''hatt'' ([[Arabic]]: handwriting, command),  ''h<U+00FC>mayun'' (imperial) and ''<U+015F>erif'' (lofty, noble). These notes were commonly written by the [[Sultan]] personally, although they could also be transcribed by a palace scribe. They were written usually in response to, and directly on, a document submitted to the sultan by the [[grand vizier]] or another officer of the [[Sublime Porte|Ottoman government]]. Thus, they could be approvals or [[Denial of request|denials]] of a letter of [[petition]], acknowledgments of a report, grants of permission for a request, an annotation to a [[decree]], or other government documents. ''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s could be composed from scratch, rather than as a response to an existing document. After the [[Tanzimat]] reform (1856), aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire, ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s of the routine kind were supplanted by the practice of ''ir<U+00E2>de-i seniyye'', in which the Sultan's spoken response was recorded on the document by his [[scribe]].

There are nearly 100,000 ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s in the Ottoman archives in [[Istanbul]]. One of them is commonly known as the [[Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun of 1856]], or just "Hatt-i Humayun", although the title ''The Reform Decree of 1856'', ''Tanzimat Ferman<U+0131>'' in Turkish, is more accurate. This decree, which started the [[Tanzimat]] reform, is so called because it carries a handwritten order by the sultan to the grand vizier to execute his command.

The term ''"hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun"'' can sometimes also be used in a literal sense, meaning a document handwritten by an [[Ottoman Sultan]].

==Types of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''==
The ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' would usually be written to the [[grand vizier]] (''Sadrazam''), or in his absence, to his replacement (the [[Kaymakam|ka'immak<U+00E2>m]]), or to another senior official such as the grand admiral ([[Kapudan-i Derya]]) or the governor-general ([[Beylerbey]]) of [[Rumeli]].

Routine decrees (''[[ferman]]'') or titles of privilege (''berat'') were written by a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal ([[tughra]]). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/> The note would emphasize a particular part of his [[edict]], urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called ''Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayunla M<U+00FC>ve<U+015F><U+015F>eh Ferman'' (ferman decorated with a ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'') or ''Unvan<U+0131>na Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun'' (''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' to the title).<ref name="koc"/> The note might use a clich<U+00E9>d phrase like "to be done as required" (''m<U+00FB>cebince amel oluna'') or "my command is to carried out as required and no one is to interfere with its execution" (''emrim m<U+00FB>cebince amel oluna, kimseye m<U+00FC>dahale etmeyeler''). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, in order to encourage or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as "if you want to keep your head, carry out this order as required" (''Ba<U+015F><U+0131>n gerek ise m<U+00FB>cebiyle amel oluna'').<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/>

"Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun on the white" (''beyaz <U+00FC>zerine hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>yun'') were documents originating with the sultan (''[[ex officio]]'') rather than a notation on an existing document. They were so called because the edict was written on a blank (i.e. white) page. They could be documents such as a command, an [[edict]], an appointment letter or a letter to a foreign ruler.

There also exist ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s expressing the sultan's opinions or even his feelings on certain matters. For example, after the successful defense of [[Mosul]] against the forces of [[Nadir Shah]], in 1743, Sultan [[Mahmud I]] sent a ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' to the governor Haj Husayn Pasha, which praised in verse the heroic exploits of the governor and the warriors of Mosul.<ref>{{cite book | title= Uralic And Altaic Series, Volumes 1-150 | author=Denis Sinor | page = 177| publisher= Psychology Press | year = 1996 | url=  http://books.google.com/books?id=UWYdLuA34OQC&pg=PA177 | isbn= 978-0-7007-0380-7}}</ref>

Do even more in the future. Let me see you."]]
In normal bureaucratic procedure, a document would be submitted by the [[grand vizier]], or his deputy the [[kaymakam]] (''K<U+00E2>'immak<U+00E2>m Pa<U+015F>a''), who would summarize a situation for the Sultan, and request the Sultan's will on the matter. Such documents were called ''telhis'' (summary) until the 19th century and  ''takrir'' (suggestion) later on.<ref name="koksal"/> The Sultan's handwritten response (his command or decision) were called ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n on telhis'' or ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n on takrir''. Other types of documents submitted to the Sultan were petitions (''arzuh<U+00E2>l''), sworn transcriptions of oral petitions (''mahzar''), reports from a higher to a lower office (''<U+015F>ukka''), religious reports by [[Qadi]]s to higher offices (''il<U+00E2>m'') and record books (''tahrirat''). These would be called ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n on arz'', ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n on mahzar'', etc. depending on the type of the document.<ref name="koksal">{{cite web | author= Osman K<U+00F6>ksal |title= Osmanl<U+0131> Hukukunda Bir Ceza Olarak S<U+00FC>rg<U+00FC>n ve <U+0130>ki Osmanl<U+0131> Sultan<U+0131>n<U+0131>n S<U+00FC>rg<U+00FC>nle <U+0130>lgili Hatt<U+0131>-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayunlar<U+0131>| url= http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/19/26/199.pdf | accessdate= 1 December 2010 | language= Turkish }}</ref> The Sultan responded not only to documents submitted to him by his viziers but also to petitions (''arzuh<U+00E2>l'') submitted to him by his subjects following the Friday prayer.<ref name="sizinti"/> Thus, ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on documents were analogous to [[Papal rescripts]] and [[rescript]]s used in other imperial regimes.

When the sultan contacted the public for Friday prayer or other occasions, people would hand in petitions addressed to him. These were later discussed and decided upon by the council of viziers. They would prepare a summary of all petitions and the action decided upon for each one. The sultan would write on the same sheet "I have been informed" (''manzurum olmu<U+015F>tur'') multiple times, followed by the item number to which he is referring. When palace bureaucracy was reorganized after the [[Tanzimat|Tanzimat reforms]], the Sultan's decision came to be written directly by the Chief Scribe at the bottom of the summary document, and this one writing applied to all decisions.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/>

== Practices ==
When a petition or memo requiring the Sultan's decision was to be submitted to him, the grand vizier usually prepared an [[executive summary]] (''telhis'') as an attachment. In some cases, rather than prepare a separate summary document, the grand vizier or his deputy would write his summary and views diagonally, on the top or bottom margins of documents coming from lower functionaries (see an example in the first figure above). Such annotations on a written document were called ''derkenar''.<ref name="koksal"/> Sometimes the grand vizier would append a separate cover page on top of a proposal coming from a lower-level functionary like the Treasurer (''[[Defterdar]]'') or the Minister of Defence (''[[Serasker]]''), introducing it as, for example, "this is the proposal of the ''Defterdar''". In such cases, the Sultan would write his ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' on the cover page. In other cases, the grand vizier would summarize the matter directly in the margin of the document submitted by the lower functionary and the Sultan would write on the same page as well. Sometimes the Sultan would write his decision on a fresh piece of paper attached to the submitted document.<ref name="koksal"/>

In most cases ''hatt-<U+0131> humayun''s were written by the Sultan himself although there exist some that were penned by the chief scribe or another functionary. Important ''hatt-<U+0131> humayun''s on the white were sometimes drafted by the head of diplomatic correspondence (''Reis-<U+00FC>l Kuttab'') or the Secretary of Navy (''Kapudan Pa<U+015F>a''). In some cases, there were notations as to who prepared the draft of the document that was then re-written by the Sultan.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/>

''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s usually were not dated, although some, concerning withdrawal of money from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s and ''irade''s had dates. [[Abdulhamid I]] was especially inclined to date his ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s. His grand vizier [[Koca Yusuf Pasha]], later suggested this practice of dating ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s to Abdulhamid's successor [[Selim III]] so that he could follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/> [[Abdulhamid II]] used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/>

The language of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on documents generally was a form of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] understandable (orally) even today and has changed little over the centuries.<ref name="koc"/><ref name="ozkaya">{{cite web | title= III.

Some Sultans would write longer comments, starting with "It has become my knowledge" (''Mal<U+00FB>mum oldu''), and continue with an introduction on the topic, then give their opinion such as "this report's/petition's/record's/''etc.'' appearance and meaning has become my imperial knowledge"(''"...&nbsp;i<U+015F>bu takr<U+00EE>rin/telh<U+00EE>sin/<U+015F>ukkan<U+0131>n/kaimenin manz<U+00FB>r ve me'azi ma'l<U+00FB>m-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>may<U+00FB>num olmu<U+015F>dur"''). Some common phrases in hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayuns are "according to this report..." (''i<U+015F>bu telhisin m<U+00FB>cebince''), "the matter is clear" (''c<U+00FC>mlesi malumdur''), "I permit" (''izin verdim''), "I give, according to the provided facts" (''vech-i me<U+015F>ruh <U+00FC>zere verdim'').<ref name="sizinti"/>

''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s to the position often had clich<U+00E9>d expressions such as "To be done as required" (''M<U+00FB>cebince amel oluna'') or "To be done as required, not to be contravened" (''M<U+00FB>cebince amel ve hil<U+00E2>f<U+0131>ndan hazer oluna'').<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/>

''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on the white were more elaborate and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as "My Vizier", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as "[[Kaymakam|Ka'immak<U+00E2>m]] Pa<U+015F>a". Those written to other officials would often start with an expression like "You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha" (''"Sen ki Rumili vez<U+00EE>rim Mehmed Pa<U+015F>a's<U+0131>n"''). The head of religious affairs ([[Sheikh ul-Islam|<U+015E>eyh<U+00FC>lislam]]) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, there would be a flowery salutation such as "after I have honored you with my glorious greeting you should know that..." (''seni sel<U+00E2>m-<U+0131> <U+015F><U+00E2>hanemle te<U+015F>rif eyledi<U+011F>imden sonra malumun ola ki...''). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/> A note without an address was meant for the grand vizier or his deputy.<ref name="koksal"/>

My imperial decree has been that, if not contrary to current law, the word of Konstantiniye is not to be printed."<ref name="sizinti"/>]]
The earliest known ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' is the one sent by Sultan [[Murad I]] to [[Gazi Evrenos|Evrenos Bey]] in 1386,<ref name="sizinti"/> commending the commander for his conquests and giving him advice on how to administer people.<ref>{{cite web|title= Murad-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>davendig<U+00E2>r'dan Gazi Evrenos Bey'e mektup...

While ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s were very rare prior to this, they proliferated afterward, especially during the reigns of Sultans such as [[Abd<U+00FC>lhamid I]], [[Selim III]] and [[Mahmud II]], who wanted to increase their control and be informed of everything.<ref name="sizinti"/>

The content of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s tends to reflect the power struggle that existed between the Sultan and his council of viziers (the [[Divan]]). The process of using the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' to authorize the actions of the grand vizier came into existence in the reign of Murad III. This led to a loss of authority and independence in the grand vizier while other palace people such as the Master of the [[Harem]] ([[Imperial Harem#Role of the eunuchs|''Harem A<U+011F>as<U+0131>'']]) or [[Imperial Harem#Role of the concubines|concubines]] (''cariye'') who had greater access to the Sultan gained in influence. By giving detailed instructions or advice, the Sultans reduced the role of the grand viziers to be just a supervisor to the execution of his commands.<ref name="koc"/> This situation appears to have created some backlash, as during most of the 17th century there were attempts to return to grand viziers' prestige and the power of "supreme proxy" (''vekil-i mutlak'') and over time ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s returned to their former simplicity. However, in the eighteenth century, Selim III became concerned by the over-centralization of the bureaucracy and its general inefficacy. He created consulting bodies (''meclis-i me<U+015F>veret'') to share some of the authority with him and the grand vizier. He would give detailed answers on ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s to questions asked of him and would make inquiries as to whether his decisions were followed. The ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' became Selim III's tool to ensure rapid and precise execution of his decisions.<ref name="koc"/>

During the reign of Mahmud II, in the early 1830s, the practice of writing on the memoranda of the grand vizier was replaced by the Chief Scribe of the Imperial Office (''M<U+00E2>beyn-i H<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>yun Ba<U+015F>katibi'') recording the Sultan's decision.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi"/> After the [[Tanzimat]], the government bureaucracy was streamlined. For most routine communications, the imperial scribe (''Serk<U+00E2>tib-i <U+015F>ehriy<U+00E2>r<U+00EE>'') began to record the spoken will (''ir<U+00E2>de'') of the Sultan and thus the ''ir<U+00E2>de'' (also called ''ir<U+00E2>de-i seniyye'', i.e., "supreme will", or ''ir<U+00E2>de-i <U+015F><U+00E2>h<U+00E2>ne'', i.e., "glorious will") replaced the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''. The use of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on the white between the Sultan and the grand vizier continued on for matters of great importance such as high level appointments or promotions. Infrequently, the grand vizier and the Sultan wrote to each other directly as well.<ref name="islam_ansiklopedisi">{{cite web | author=  |title= Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>yun | work=<U+0130>slam Ansiklopedisi | publisher= T<U+00FC>rkiye Diyanet Vakf<U+0131> |year =1988  | language= Turkish }}</ref>

The large number of documents that required the Sultan's decision through either a ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' or an ''irade-i senniye'' is considered to be an indication of how centralized the Ottoman government was.<ref name="sizinti"/> [[Abd<U+00FC>lhamid I]] has written himself in one of his ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s "I have no time that my pen leaves my hand, with God's resolve it does not.<ref name="sizinti">{{cite journal | author= H<U+00FC>seyin <U+00D6>zdemir  | title= Hatt-<U+0131> Humay<U+0131>n  | journal=S<U+0131>z<U+0131>nt<U+0131> | year= 2009 | volume=31 | issue=365 | page= 230 |url=http://www.sizinti.com.tr/konular/ayrinti/hatt-i-humayin.html |  accessdate = 29 November 2010 | quote= Benim bir vaktim yokdur ki kalem elimden d<U+00FC><U+015F>mez.

''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s sent to the grand vizier were handled and recorded at the <U+00C2>medi Kalemi, the secretariat of the grand vizier. The <U+00C2>medi Kalemi organized and recorded all correspondence between the grand vizier and the Sultan, as well as any correspondence with foreign rulers and with Ottoman ambassadors. Other ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s, not addressed to the grand vizier, were stored in other document stores (called ''fon'' in the terminology of current Turkish archivists).<ref name="koc"/>

=== Cut-out ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s ===
During the creation of the State Archives in the nineteenth century, documents were organized according to their importance. ''Hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on the white were considered the most important, along with those on international relations, border transactions and internal regulations. Documents of secondary importance were routinely placed in trunks and stored in cellars in need of repair. Presumably as a sign of respect toward the Sultan,<ref name="sizinti"/> ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on documents (petitions, reports, ''etc.'') were cut out and stored together with the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s on the white, while the rest of the documents were stored elsewhere.<ref name="hazineievrak">{{cite web | author= Seyfullah Aslan|  title= Hazine-i Evrak<U+0131>n Kurulmas<U+0131> | url= http://muverrih.net/2009/03/13/hazine-i-evrakin-kurulmasi/ | accessdate= 1 December 2010| language= Turkish }}</ref> These cut-out ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s were not cross-referenced with the documents to which they referred and were only annotated by the palace office using general terms and an approximate date. Because Sultans were not in the habit of dating their ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s until the late period of the empire, in most cases the documents associated with them are not known. Conversely, the decisions on many a memorandum, petition, or request submitted to the Sultan are unknown. The separation of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s from their documents is considered a great loss of information for researchers.<ref>{{cite journal| author=<U+0130>shak Keskin |title=Osmanl<U+0131> Ar<U+015F>ivcili<U+011F>inin Teorik Dayanaklar<U+0131> Hakk<U+0131>nda | journal= T<U+00FC>rk K<U+00FC>t<U+00FC>phanecili<U+011F>i | year= 2007 | volume= 21 | pages = 271<U+2013>303| url=http://tk.kutuphaneci.org.tr/index.php/tk/article/viewFile/2015/4008| language= Turkish }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Fatih Rukanc<U+0131>|title=Osmanl<U+0131> Devleti<U+2019>nde Ar<U+015F>ivcilik <U+00C7>al<U+0131><U+015F>malar<U+0131> | journal= T<U+00FC>rk K<U+00FC>t<U+00FC>phanecili<U+011F>i | year= 2008 | volume= 22 | pages = 414<U+2013>434| url= http://tk.kutuphaneci.org.tr/index.php/tk/article/viewFile/2051/4078 | language= Turkish }}</ref> The [[Ottoman Archives]] in Istanbul has a special section of "cut-out ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s".<ref name="sizinti"/>

Because the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s were originally not organized systematically, historians in the nineteenth and early twentieth century created several catalogs of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s based on different organizing principles. These historic catalogs are still in use by historians at the BOA:<ref>{{cite web | work= 19.Y<U+00FC>zy<U+0131>l T<U+00FC>rkiye Y<U+00F6>netim Tarihi | title=19.

'''''Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>m<U+00E2>y<U+00FB>n Tasnifi''''' is the catalog of the ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s belonging to the <U+00C2>medi Kalemi. It consists of 31 volumes listing 62,312 documents, with their short summaries. This catalog lists documents from 1730 to 1839 but covers primarily those from the reigns of Selim III and Mahmud II within this period.

'''''Ali Emiri Tasnifi''''' is a chronological catalog of 181,239 documents organized according to the periods of sovereignty of Sultans, from the foundation of the Ottoman state to the Abd<U+00FC>lmecid period. Along with ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s, this catalog includes documents on foreign relations.

'''''<U+0130>bn<U+00FC>lemin Tasnifi''''' is a catalog created by a committee led by historian <U+0130>bn<U+00FC>lemin Mahmud Kemal. It covers the period of 1290-1873. Along with 329 ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s, it lists documents of various other types relating to palace correspondence, private correspondence, appointments, land grants ([[timar]] and [[zeamet]]), and charitable endowments ([[vak<U+0131>f]]).

'''''Muallim Cevdet Tasnifi''''' catalogs 216,572 documents in 34 volumes, organized by topics that include local governments, provincial administration, vak<U+0131>f and internal security.

Although there exist thousands of ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''s, [[Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun of 1856|the Imperial Reform Edict]] (or ''Isl<U+00E2>hat Ferm<U+00E2>n<U+0131>'') of 1856 is well enough known that most history texts refer to it simply as "Hatt-i H<U+00FC>mayun". This decree from Sultan [[Abd<U+00FC>lmecid I]] promised equality in education, government appointments, and administration of justice to all, regardless of creed. In ''D<U+00FC>stur'', the Ottoman [[code of law]]s, the text of this [[ferman]] is introduced as "a copy of the supreme ferman written to the grand vizier, perfected by decoration above with a ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''."<ref>{{cite journal|author=| title= Islahata dair taraf-<U+0131> Vek<U+00E2>let-i mutlakaya hitaben balas<U+0131> hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun ile m<U+00FC>ve<U+015F><U+015F>eh <U+015F>erefsad<U+0131>r olan ferman-<U+0131> <U+00E2>linin suretidir | journal= D<U+00FC>stur (Istanbul: Matbaa-i <U+00C2>mire)| volume= 1 | year=1856 | language= Turkish}} See footnote 4 in: {{cite web|  title= Ottoman Financial Integration with Europe: Foreign Loans, the Ottoman Bank and the Ottoman Public Debt | author= Edhem Eldem | url= http://www.econ.uoa.gr/UA/files/964411180..pdf | accessdate= 5 December 2010| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060503174847/http://www.econ.uoa.gr/UA/files/964411180..pdf | archivedate=2006-05-31}}</ref> So, technically this edict was a ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun'' to the rank.

The Reform Decree of 1856 is sometimes referred to by another name,  "The Rescript of Reform".<ref>{{cite web| author= Bo<U+011F>azi<U+00E7>i University, Atat<U+00FC>rk Institute of Modern Turkish History | title= Rescript of Reform <U+2013> Islahat Ferman<U+0131> (18 February 1856) | url= http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/reform.htm | accessdate= 05 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Shaw, Stanford J. and G<U+00F6>khan <U+00C7>etinsaya. | chapter= Ottoman Empire |title=In The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World.

The ''Hatt-<U+0131> H<U+00FC>mayun'' of 1856 was an extension of another important edict of reform, the [[Hatt-i Sharif|Hatt-i Sharif of G<U+00FC>lhane]] of 1839, and part of the [[Tanzimat]] reforms. That document is also generally referred to as "The Hatt-i Sharif", although there are many other hatt-i sharifs, a term that is synonymous with ''hatt-<U+0131> h<U+00FC>mayun''.

== The Sultan's script ==
