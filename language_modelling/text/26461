'''German submarine ''U-594''''' was a [[German Type VIIC submarine|Type VIIC]] [[U-boat]] built for [[Nazi Germany]]'s ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' for service during [[World War II]].
She was laid down on 17 December 1940 by [[Blohm & Voss]], [[Hamburg]] as 'werk' 570, launched on 3 September 1941 and commissioned on 30 October 1941 under ''Kptlt'' Dietrich Hoffmann.

==Service History==
The boat's career began with training at [[8th U-boat Flotilla]] on 30 October 1941, followed by active service on 1 December 1942 as part of the [[1st U-boat Flotilla|1st Flotilla]] for the remainder of her service.

In 6 patrols she sank 2 merchant ships, for a total of {{GRT|14,390|first=yes}}.

===Wolf Packs===
U-594 took part in 6 wolf packs, namely
* [[Wolf pack Bl<U+00FC>cher|Bl<U+00FC>cher]] (14 Aug 1942 <U+2013> 28 Aug 1942)
* Stier (29 Aug 1943 <U+2013> 2 Sep 1942)
* [[Wolf pack Vorw<U+00E4>rts|Vorw<U+00E4>rts]] (2 Sep 1942 <U+2013> 17 Sep 1942)
* Jaguar (10 Jan 1943 <U+2013> 31 Jan 1943)
* [[Wolfpack Pfeil|Pfeil]] (1 Feb 1943 <U+2013> 9 Feb 1943)
* L<U+00F6>wenherz (1 Apr 1943 <U+2013> 10 Apr 1943)

===[[Convoy ON 127]]===
The convoy, westbound from the UK to New York, assembled in the North Channel during 5 September 1942. The convoy comprised 32 ships, many of them oil tankers in ballast. The ocean escort, [[Mid-Ocean_Escort_Force#Escort_Group_C-4|C4]], was largely Canadian.

Soon after sunset the convoy set off in eight columns of four. 600 miles out into the Atlantic Wolf Pack [[Wolf pack Vorw<U+00E4>rts|Vorw<U+00E4>rts]] waited in ambush. Of the 13 U-boats, very few of their commanders had combat experience or success to their name; Friedrich Mumm in ''U-594'' was a complete novice.

Initial contact came on the evening of 9 September 1942, and by this time ''Vorw<U+00E4>rts'' had been reinforced with additional boats from ''Stier''. The weather was fine with good visibility but the convoy escorts had been forewarned by the Admiralty about the presence of the enemy.

On 12 September, both {{GS|U-407||2}} and ''U-594'' launched torpedoes unsuccessfully that night. ''U-594'' eventually sank the straggling 6,131 GRT American-owned Panamanian-flagged steamer ''Stone Street'' with a single torpedo which struck the engine room on the port side.

When ''U-594'' surfaced she accidentally capsized the ''Stone Street''<U+2019>s lifeboat, but the men were taken aboard, questioned and provided with supplies of whiskey and food, then released; except for the master who was retained as a POW.

===Fate===
''U-594'' was sunk on 4 June 1943 in the [[North Atlantic]] in position {{coord|35|55|N|09|25|W}}, by depth charges from a RAF [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] bomber. All hands were lost.
