'''Seafood''' is any form of [[sea life]] regarded as [[food]] by humans. Seafood prominently includes [[Fish (food)|fish]] and [[shellfish]]. 
Shellfish include various species of [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. Historically, [[sea mammal]]s such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent these days. Edible sea plants, such as some [[seaweed]]s and [[microalgae]], are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the [[:Category:Sea vegetables|category of sea vegetables]]). In [[North America]], although not generally in the [[United Kingdom]], the term "seafood" is extended to [[fresh water]] organisms eaten by humans, so all edible [[aquatic life]] may be referred to as seafood. For the sake of completeness, this article includes all edible aquatic life.

The harvesting of [[Wild fisheries|wild seafood]] is known as [[fishing]] and the cultivation and farming of seafood is known as [[aquaculture]], [[mariculture]], or in the case of fish, [[fish farming]]. Seafood is often distinguished from [[meat]], although it is still animal and is excluded in a strict vegetarian diet. Seafood is an important source of [[protein]] in many [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]] around the world, especially in coastal areas. 

Most of the seafood harvest is consumed by humans, but a significant proportion is used as  [[fish food]] to farm other fish or rear farm animal. Some seafoods ([[kelp]]) are used as food for other plants ([[fertilizer]]). In these ways, seafoods are indirectly used to produce further food for human consumption. Products, such as [[fish oil]] and [[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina tablets]] are also extracted from seafoods. Some seafood is feed to aquarium fish, or used to feed domestic pets, such as cats, and a small proportion is used in medicine, or is used industrially for non-food purposes (leather).

{{main|History of seafood}}

The harvesting, processing, and consuming of seafoods are ancient practices that date back to at least the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]] period about 40,000 years ago.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/11/1108_bonetool_2.html African Bone Tools Dispute Key Idea About Human Evolution] National Geographic News article.</ref> Isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of [[Tianyuan man]], a 40,000 year old modern human from eastern Asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish.<ref>Yaowu Hu Y, Hong Shang H, Haowen Tong H, Olaf Nehlich O, Wu Liu W, Zhao C, Yu J, Wang C, Trinkaus E and Richards M (2009) [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10971.short "Stable isotope dietary analysis of the Tianyuan 1 early modern human"] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', '''106''' (27) 10971-10974.</ref><ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news166120605.html First direct evidence of substantial fish consumption by early modern humans in China] ''[[PhysOrg.com]]'', 6 July 2009.</ref> [[Archaeological|Archaeology]] features such as [[midden|shell middens]],<ref>[http://www.york.ac.uk/depts/arch/middens/index.htm Coastal Shell Middens and Agricultural Origins in Atlantic Europe].</ref> discarded fish bones and [[cave painting]]s show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. During this period, most people lived a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at [[Lepenski Vir]], they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.

The ancient [[river]] [[Nile]] was full of fish; fresh and dried fish were a staple food for much of the population.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://www.icsf.net/jsp/publication/samudra/pdf/english/issue_28/art01.pdf Fisheries history: Gift of the Nile]}}</ref> The [[Egyptians]] had implements and methods for fishing and these are illustrated in [[tomb]] scenes, drawings, and [[papyrus]] documents. Some representations hint at fishing being pursued as a pastime.

Fishing scenes are rarely represented in [[ancient Greek]] culture, a reflection of the low social status of fishing. However, [[Oppian|Oppian of Corycus]], a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the ''Halieulica'' or ''Halieutika'', composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood ([[squid]], [[octopus]], and [[shellfish]]) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. [[Sardine]]s and [[Anchovy|anchovies]] were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on [[Lake Copais]], provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was ''skaren'' (probably [[parrotfish]]) whereas [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] was three times as expensive.<ref>Dalby, p.67.</ref> Common salt water fish were [[yellowfin tuna]], [[red mullet]], [[Batoidea|ray]], [[swordfish]] or [[sturgeon]], a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its [[eel]]s, celebrated by the hero of ''[[The Acharnians]]''. Other fresh water fish were [[esox|pike-fish]], [[carp]] and the less appreciated [[catfish]].

Pictorial evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fishing comes from [[mosaic]]s.<ref>[http://museum.agropolis.fr/english/pages/expos/aliments/poissons/images/mosaique.htm Image of fishing illustrated in a Roman mosaic].</ref> At a certain time the [[goatfish]] was considered the epitome of luxury, above all because its scales exhibit a bright red color when it dies out of water. For this reason these fish were occasionally allowed to die slowly at the table. There even was a recipe where this would take place ''in garo'', in the [[Garum|sauce]]. At the beginning of the Imperial era, however, this custom suddenly came to an end, which is why ''mullus'' in the feast of [[Trimalchio]] (see ''the [[Satyricon]]'') could be shown as a characteristic of the ''[[parvenu]]'', who bores his guests with an unfashionable display of dying fish.

In [[medieval]] times, seafood was less prestigious than other animal meats, and often seen as merely an alternative to meat on fast days. Still, seafood was the mainstay of many coastal populations. [[Kipper]]s made from herring caught in the [[North Sea]] could be found in markets as far away as [[Constantinople]].<ref>Adamson (2002), p. 11.</ref> While large quantities of fish were eaten fresh, a large proportion was salted, dried, and, to a lesser extent, smoked. [[Stockfish]], cod that was split down the middle, fixed to a pole and dried, was very common, though preparation could be time-consuming, and meant beating the dried fish with a mallet before soaking it in water. A wide range of [[Mollusca|mollusk]]s including [[oyster]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[scallop]]s were eaten by coastal and river-dwelling populations, and freshwater [[crayfish]] were seen as a desirable alternative to meat during fish days. Compared to meat, fish was much more expensive for inland populations, especially in Central Europe, and therefore not an option for most.<ref>Adamson (2004), pp. 45<U+2013>39.</ref>

Modern knowledge of the reproductive cycles of aquatic species has led to the development of [[Fish hatchery|hatcheries]] and improved techniques of [[fish farming]] and [[aquaculture]]. Better understanding of the [[shellfish poisoning|hazards]] of eating raw and undercooked fish and shellfish has led to improved preservation methods and processing.

A [[Valve (mollusc)|valve]] is the name used for the protective shell of a bivalve, so bivalve literally means ''two shells''. Important seafood bivalves include [[oyster]]s, [[scallop]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s. Most of these are [[filter feeder]]s which bury themselves in sediment on the [[seabed]] where they are safe from [[predation]]. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some, such as scallops, can [[nekton|swim]]. Bivalves have long been a part of the diet of coastal communities. Oysters were [[oyster farming|cultured]] in ponds by the Romans and [[mariculture]] has more recently become an important source of bivalves for food.

They have excellent vision and high intelligence. Cephalopods propel themselves with a water jet and lay down "smoke screens" with [[Cephalopod ink|ink]]. Examples are [[octopus]], [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]]. They are eaten in many cultures. Depending on the species, the arms and sometimes other body parts are prepared in various ways. Octopus must be boiled properly to rid it of slime, smell, and residual ink. Squid are poular in Japan. In Mediterranean countries and in Britain squid are often referred to as [[calamari]].<ref name="MW">{{cite web|url=http://m-w.com/dictionary/calamari|title=Definition of calamari|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster's]] Online Dictionary}}</ref> Cuttlefish is less eaten than squid, though it is popular in Italy and [[Dried shredded squid|dried, shredded cuttlefish]] is a snack food in East Asia.

| valign= top | [[Jellyfish]] are soft and gelatinous, with a body shaped like an umbrella or bell which pulsates for locomotion. They have long, trailing tentacles with stings for capturing prey. They are found free-swimming in the [[water column]] in all oceans, and are occasionally found in freshwater. Jellyfish must be dried within hours to prevent spoiling. In Japan they are regarded as a delicacy. Traditional processing methods are carried out by a Jellyfish Master. This involve a 20 to 40 day multi-phase procedure which starts with removing the gonads and [[mucous membrane]]s. The umbrella and oral arms are then treated with a mixture of [[table salt]] and [[alum]], and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a crisp and crunchy texture. Only [[scyphozoan]] jellyfish belonging to the order [[Rhizostomeae]] are harvested for food; about 12 of the approximately 85 species. Most of the harvest takes place in southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1011879821323 | last1 = Omori | first1 = M. | last2 = Nakano | first2 = E. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 2001 | title = Jellyfish fisheries in southeast Asia | url = | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 451 | issue = | pages = 19<U+2013>26 }}</ref>

Fish is a highly [[Decomposition|perishable]] product. The ''fishy'' smell of dead fish is due to the breakdown of [[amino acid]]s into [[Polyamine|biogenic amines]] and [[ammonia]].<ref>N. Narain and Nunes, M.L. Marine Animal and Plant Products. ''In:'' Handbook of Meat, Poultry and Seafood Quality, L.M.L. Nollet and T. Boylston, eds. Blackwell Publishing 2007, p 247.</ref>

Live [[food fish]] are often transported in tanks at high expense for an [[live food fish trade|international market]] that prefers its seafood killed immediately before it is cooked. This process originally was started by Lindeye. Delivery of live fish without water is also being explored.<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2005039280&IA=WO2005039280&DISPLAY=DESC WIPO]</ref> While some seafood [[restaurant]]s keep live fish in [[aquarium|aquaria]] for display purposes or for cultural beliefs, the majority of live fish are kept for dining customers. The live food fish trade in [[Hong Kong]], for example, is estimated to have driven imports of live food fish to more than 15,000 [[tonne]]s in 2000. Worldwide sales that year were estimated at US$400&nbsp;million, according to the World Resources Institute.<ref>[http://marine.wri.org/pubs_content_text.cfm?ContentID=645 The World Resources Institute, The live reef fish trade]</ref>

If the [[cool chain]] has not been adhered to correctly, food products generally decay and become harmful before the [[Shelf life|validity date]] printed on the package. As the potential harm for a consumer when eating rotten fish is much larger than for example with dairy products, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has introduced regulation in the USA requiring the use of a [[time temperature indicator]] on certain fresh chilled seafood products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2003/ucm147270.htm |title=La Rosa Logistics Inc 14-Jan-03 |publisher=Fda.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-02}}</ref>

Fresh fish is a highly perishable food product, so it must be eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are [[Fillet (cut)|filleted]] and displayed for sale on a bed of [[crushed ice]] or [[refrigeration|refrigerated]]. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated [[Refrigerator car|train]] and [[Refrigerator truck|truck]] [[transportation]] has made fresh fish more widely available inland.

Long term [[Food preservation|preservation]] of fish is accomplished in a variety of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are [[Stockfish|drying]] and [[salting (food)|salting]].  [[Desiccation]] (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as [[cod]]. Partial drying and salting is popular for the preservation of fish like [[herring]] and [[mackerel]]. Fish such as [[salmon]], [[tuna]], and [[herring]] are cooked and [[canning|canned]]. Most fish are filleted prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g. [[sardine]]s) are only [[decapitation|decapitated]] and gutted prior to canning.

==Consumption==
Seafood is consumed all over the world; it provides the world's prime source of high-quality [[protein]]: 14<U+2013>16% of the animal protein consumed world-wide; over one billion people rely on seafood as their primary source of animal protein.<ref>[[World Health Organization]].</ref><ref>Tidwell JH and Allan GL (2002) [http://www.mendeley.com/research/fish-food-aquacultures-contribution-ecological-economic-impacts-contributions-fish-farming-capture-fisheries-2/ "Fish as food: aquaculture<U+2019>s contribution Ecological and economic impacts and contributions of fish farming and capture fisheries"] ''World Aquaculture'', '''33''' (3): 44<U+2013>48.
</ref> Fish is among the most common [[food allergy|food allergens]].<ref>[[Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network]]</ref>

[[Iceland]], [[Japan]], and [[Portugal]] are the greatest consumers of seafood per capita in the world.<ref>Aquamedia</ref>

The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] recommends that at least two portions of seafood should be consumed each week, one of which should be oil-rich. There are over 100 different types of seafood available around the coast of the UK.

Oil-rich fish such as [[mackerel]] or [[herring]] are rich in long chain [[Omega-3]] oils.  These oils are found in every cell of the human body, and are required for human biological functions such as brain functionality.

Whitefish such as haddock and cod are very low in fat and calories which, combined with oily fish rich in [[Omega-3]] such as [[mackerel]], [[sardine]]s, fresh [[tuna]], [[salmon]] and [[trout]], can help to protect against [[coronary heart disease]], as well as helping to develop strong bones and teeth.

[[Shellfish]] are particularly rich in [[zinc]], which is essential for healthy skin and muscles as well as fertility. [[Casanova]] reputedly ate 50 [[oyster]]s a day.<ref>Slovenko R (2001) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/jpsych29&div=12&id=&page= "Aphrodisiacs-Then and Now"] ''Journal of Psychiatry and Law'', '''29''': 103f.</ref><ref>McMurray P and Ingber S (2007) [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=MJHU67VwJ9kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Consider+the+Oyster:+A+Shucker%27s+Field+Guide&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5JUGULXOHfGZiQft6-myCA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Consider%20the%20Oyster%3A%20A%20Shucker%27s%20Field%20Guide&f=false ''Consider the Oyster: A Shucker's Field Guide''] Page 15, Pan Australia.

==Health benefits==
Research over the past few decades has shown that the nutrients and minerals in seafood can make improvements in brain development and reproduction and has highlighted the role for seafood in the functionality of the human body.<ref>"[http://www.bim.ie/templates/text_content.asp?node_id=742 Nutritional Aspects of Fish]." ''Irish Sea Fisheries Board ''</ref>

Doctors have known of strong links between fish and healthy hearts ever since they noticed that fish-eating Inuit populations in the Arctic had low levels of [[heart disease]]. One study has suggested that adding one portion of fish a week to your diet can cut your chances of suffering a heart attack by half. Fish is thought to protect the heart because eating less [[saturated fat]] and more Omega-3 can help to lower the amount of cholesterol and [[triglyceride]]s in the blood <U+2013> two fats that, in excess, increase the risk of heart disease. Omega-3 fats also have natural built-in anti-oxidants, which are thought to stop the thickening and damaging of artery walls. Regularly eating fish oils is also thought to reduce the risk of [[arrhythmia]] <U+2013> irregular electrical activity in the heart which increases the risk of sudden heart attacks.<ref name="What's so healthy about seafood">"[http://www.seafood.net.au/files/whathealthy.pdf What's so healthy about seafood]". ''Australian Government, [[Fisheries Research and Development Corporation]]''.

10-12% of the human brain is composed of [[lipid]]s,<ref>Chudler EH (n.d.). ''[http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html Brain facts and figures.]'' [[University of Washington]]. Retrieved 26 Dec. 2009</ref> including the Omega-3 fat [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]]. Recent studies suggest that older people can boost their brain power by eating more oily fish, what with regular consumers being able to remember better and think faster than those who don't consume at all. Other research has also suggested that adding more DHA to the diet of children with [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] can reduce their behavioural problems and improve their reading skills, while there have also been links suggested between DHA and better concentration. Separate studies have suggested that older people who eat fish at least once a week could also have a lower chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.<ref name="What's so healthy about seafood"/>

Including fish as a regular part of a balanced diet has been shown to help the symptoms of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] <U+2013> a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility.  Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up.<ref>Rice R. (2004)''Seafood - an essential part of 21st century eating patterns''. The Fish Foundation.</ref> Recent research has also found a link between Omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.

Fish is high in minerals such as [[zinc]], [[iodine]] and [[selenium]], which keep the body running smoothly. Iodine is essential for the thyroid gland, which controls growth and metabolism, while selenium is used to make enzymes that protect cell walls from cancer-causing free radicals, and helps prevent DNA damage caused by radiation and some chemicals. Fish is also a source of [[vitamin A]], which is needed for healthy skin and eyes, and vitamin D, which is needed to help the body absorb calcium to strengthen teeth and bones.

==Health hazards==
{{See also|Health hazards of eating fish|Mercury in fish}}

[[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have a natural tendency to concentrate [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in their bodies, often in the form of [[methylmercury]], a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the [[food chain]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]], [[albacore tuna]], and [[tilefish]] contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the [[food chain]] amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called [[biomagnification]]. The first occurrence of widespread [[mercury poisoning]] in humans occurred this way in [[Minamata, Kumamoto|Minamata]], [[Japan]], now called [[Minamata disease]].

[[Shellfish]] are among the more common [[food allergy|food allergens]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Common Food Allergens | url = http://www.foodallergy.org/allergens/index.html | publisher = [[Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network]] | accessdate = June 24, 2007}}</ref>

==Sustainability==
{{See also|Overfishing|Sustainable seafood|Sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification}}

Research into population trends of various species of seafood is pointing to a global collapse of seafood species by 2048. Such a collapse would occur due to pollution and overfishing, threatening oceanic ecosystems,  according to some researchers.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/11/03/world_seafood_supply_could_run_out_by_2048_researchers_warn/ World Seafood Supply Could Run Out by 2048 Researchers Warn] boston.com. Retrieved 6 February 2007</ref>

A major international scientific study released in November 2006 in the journal ''[[Science]]'' found that about one-third of all fishing stocks worldwide have collapsed (with a collapse being defined as a decline to less than 10% of their maximum observed abundance), and that if current trends continue all fish stocks worldwide will collapse within fifty years.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6108414.stm 'Only 50 years left' for sea fish]", BBC News. 2 November 2006.</ref>  In July 2009, [[Boris Worm]] of [[Dalhousie University]], the author of the November 2006 study in ''[[Science]],'' co-authored an update on the state of the world's fisheries with one of the original study's critics, [[Ray Hilborn]] of the [[University of Washington]] at Seattle.  The new study found that through good fisheries management techniques even depleted fish stocks can be revived and made commercially viable again.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/31/science/earth/31fish.html Study Finds Hope in Saving Saltwater Fish] The New York Times. Retrieved 4 August 2009</ref>

The [[FAO]] State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2004 report estimates that in 2003, of the main fish stocks or groups of resources for which assessment information is available, "approximately one-quarter were [[overexploited]], depleted or recovering from depletion (16%, 7% and 1% respectively) and needed rebuilding."<ref>"[http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/DOCREP/007/y5600e/y5600e05.htm@ The Status of the Fishing Fleet]," ''The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture: 2004''.</ref>

The [[National Fisheries Institute]], a trade advocacy group representing the United States seafood industry, disagree. They claim  that currently observed declines in fish population are due to natural fluctuations and that enhanced technologies will eventually alleviate whatever impact humanity is having on oceanic life.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15532333/ Seafood Could Collapse by 2050, Experts Warn], msnbc.com.
