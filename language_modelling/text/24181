'''Augustus le Plongeon''' ([[1826]]-[[1908]]) was a [[photographer]], [[antiquarian]] and amateur [[archaeologist]] who made the first attempted excavations and photographic records of the ruins of [[Chichen Itza]], a site of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] on the northern [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]], [[Central America]].  He wrote a lengthy history of Maya culture, going so far as to propose a theory that Maya had founded [[Ancient Egypt]], a theory which has since been discredited by the scientific community. In general, his theories were considered to be somewhat outlandish by near-contempories and later [[Mayanist]] scholars such as [[Teoberto Maler]] and [[Alfred Maudslay]], and he is regarded today as one of the more eccentric characters to have worked in the field.<ref>{{cite book | first=Michael D. | last=Coe | authorlink=Michael D.

== Early life and careers ==

Le Plongeon was born on the island of [[Jersey]] on [[May 4]], [[1826]].  He attended and graduated from [[Ecole Polytechnique]] in [[Paris]].

After graduation, at the age of 19, he sailed to [[South America]] and was caught in a [[shipwreck]] off the coast of [[Chile]].  While there he settled in [[Valparaiso]] and taught [[mathematics]], [[drawing]], and languages at a local college.  In [[1849]], news of the [[California gold rush]] reached him, and he sailed to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] to work as a [[surveyor]], and also apprenticed to became a doctor of medicine.  One of his accomplishments as a surveyor included drawing a plan for the layout of the town of [[Marysville, California]] in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]] in [[1851]].

He then moved to [[England]] and studied [[photography]] later in [[1851]].  After learning photography, he returned to San Francisco in [[1855]] to open a [[daguerreotype]] portrait studio on Clay Street.  In [[1862]], he traveled to [[Lima, Peru]] and opened yet another photography studio and an "electro-hydropathic" medical clinic.

== Travels in Peru ==
Le Plongeon started full time research on the Maya civilization, and pioneered the use of photography as a tool for his studies.  He began using the wet [[collodion]] glass-plate [[negative (photography)|negative]] process he used for studio portraits to record his exploration.  He traveled extensively all over [[Peru]] for eight years visiting and photographing the ancient ruins.

In [[1870]], he left Peru and traveled back once again to San Francisco where he gave a number of illustrated lectures at the [[California Academy of Sciences]] on Peruvian archaeology and the causes of [[earthquake]]s.  His travels then continued on to [[New York]], and by [[1871]] he was at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] studying [[Mesoamerica]]n [[manuscript]]s.  His reading of the works of the French scholar [[Charles Etienne Brasseur de Bourbourg]] culminated in a stirring belief that [[civilization]] had its origins in the [[New World]].

== Further research and development of theories ==
While in [[London]] he met and married [[Alice Dixon Le Plongeon|Alice Dixon]], the woman with whom he would collaborate for the rest of his life.  Alice, born in London in [[1851]], had been well educated, and also taught the art of photography by her father Henry Dixon - a man who was recognized in the late [[nineteenth century]] for his contribution to the development of [[panchromatic]] photography, and for his photos of London [[architecture]] taken for the Society for Preserving the Relics of Old London.

Augustus le Plongeon also had the opportunity to learn the technology of creating photographic negatives directly from the father of modern photography, [[William Fox Talbot]] in [[1873]].

After he had made what he considered to be a complete comparative study of Maya and Egyptian [[religion]], [[linguistics]], and architecture, he concluded that Maya culture had been diffused throughout [[Southeast Asia]] by Maya travelers who then went on to the [[Middle East]] to found Egyptian civilization.  While most archaeologists of the early and mid-nineteenth century placed the Maya civilization later than Egypt, the chronologies were still relatively uncertain and Le Plongeon's theory found some adherents.

== Travels in Yucat<U+00E1>n ==
In [[1873]], the le Plongeons traveled to Yucat<U+00E1>n, and remained there almost continuously until [[1885]] in search of cultural connections between the Maya and Ancient Egypt.  They used photography to record what they considered evidence of those connections, but also attempted a thorough photographic record of the sites as a basis for future general research.  Their photographic work was methodical and systematic, and they took hundreds of [[stereogram|3-D photos]].  

They documented entire Maya buildings such as the 'Governor's Palace' at [[Uxmal]] in overlapping photos by placing the camera on a tall tripod or scaffold to correct for perspective, and then processed the plates in the dark rooms of Maya buildings.  In addition to entire facades of buildings, they also photographed small [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and architectural details such as [[bas-relief]]s, [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic]] inscriptions, and [[sculpture]]s.  

[[image:Chac Mool1.jpg|thumb|240 px|left|[[Chac Mool]] statue from the [[Chichen Itza]] site]]
At [[Chichen Itza]] they excavated a curiously-formed statue or altar figurine, [[neologism|coining]] the name "[[Chac Mool]]" (or ''chacmool'') for it, from a structure known as the "Platform of the Eagles and Jaguars". Although their alleged derivation of the name is known now to have had no association with figures of this type, the name has remained in general use among later archaeologists. This statue would later be used as a demonstration of [[Toltec]] influences at the site, with other examples found at the Toltec's capital, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]]. They also  documented their excavation of the Platform of Venus with photos as well as plan and cross-section drawings, and visited and photographed other Maya sites such as [[Izamal]], [[Isla Mujeres]], [[Cozumel]], [[Canc<U+00FA>n]], and Ake, and traveled to [[Belize]] (British Honduras).

Le Plongeon is also known for his attempted translation of the [[Troano Codex]], a translation which is considered by nearly all authorities to be completely mistaken.  He claimed that one section detailed the destruction of the lost continent of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], which he intepreted as [[Atlantis]].

== Theories and later career ==
By the [[1880s]], while other [[Mayanists]] fully accepted that the Maya post-dated [[Ancient Egypt]], Le Plongeon refused to yield to the new findings.  He stood by his years of field and archival studies, and challenged those he considered "armchair" archaeologists to debate the issues.  But the [[chronology]] and evidence against [[cultural diffusion]] was overwhelming, and he very quickly found himself ignored, his theories condemned to the fringe of the new profession.

He was never fully recognized for his work in the Yucat<U+00E1>n, but his over five hundred photos still remain an important contribution to American archaeology.  Augustus spent the remainder of his life in [[Brooklyn, New York]], writing about the connections between Maya and Egypt and defending himself against detractors.  Augustus le Plongeon died in Brooklyn in [[1908]] at the age of eighty-three; Alice followed in [[1910]] at the age of fifty-nine.

== Published works ==
A collection of the works of the le Plongeons currently resides at the [[Getty Center|Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles]].  The archive contains original records covering their travels from the [[1860s]] through the early [[1900s]], including diaries, unpublished scholarly manuscripts and notes, correspondence, and extensive photographic documentation of ancient architecture and sculpture, city views, and ethnographic studies.
