'''''Tragic Kingdom''''' is the third studio album by the American [[third wave ska]] band [[No Doubt]]. It was released on October 10, 1995, on [[Trauma Records]], a division of [[Interscope Records]]. The album was produced by [[Matthew Wilder]], mixed by Paul Palmer, and recorded in 11 studios in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] between March 1993 and October 1995. Between 1995 and 1998, seven singles were released from it, including "[[Just a Girl]]", which charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]]; and "[[Don't Speak]]", which reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay]] and peaked in the top five of many international charts.

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At the [[39th Grammy Awards]], No Doubt earned nominations for [[Best New Artist]] and [[Best Rock Album]]. The album has sold over 16&nbsp;million copies worldwide; and was certified diamond by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the United States and Canada, platinum in the United Kingdom, and triple platinum in Australia. It helped to initiate the [[ska]] revival of the 1990s, persuading record labels to sign more ska bands and helping them to attract more mainstream attention. 

No Doubt embarked on a [[#Tour|tour]] to promote the album. It was designed by Project X and lasted two and a half years. An early 1997 performance at the [[Honda Centre|Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim]] was filmed and released as ''[[Live in the Tragic Kingdom]]'' on [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]].

==Background==
No Doubt released its debut album ''[[No Doubt (No Doubt album)|No Doubt]]'' in 1992, a year after being signed to [[Interscope Records|Interscope]]. The album's [[pop music|pop]]-oriented sound sharply contrasted with [[grunge music]], a genre which was very popular at the time in the United States.<ref name="allmusicalbum">{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:ief2zfgheh2k~T0 |title= No Doubt&nbsp;> Overview |accessdate=October 16, 2008 |author=Bush, John |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The album sold 30,000 copies;<ref name="ocw">{{cite web |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/music/tunes-and-toons/23963/ |title= Tunes and 'Toons |accessdate=August 31, 2008 |author=Vineyard, Jennifer |date=February 26, 1998 |publisher=''[[OC Weekly]]''}}</ref><ref name="band">{{cite web |url=http://www.nodoubt.com/band/ |title=Timeline |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=No Doubt official website}}</ref> in the words of the program director of [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]], a California radio station on which it was one of the band's driving ambitions to be played: "It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio."<ref name="band"/><ref name=time>{{cite journal |last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |date=April 10, 2000 |title=Two-Hit Wonders |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=155 |issue=14 |pages=Visions 21 |publisher=Time, Inc. |location=Chicago |issn=0040-781X |oclc=7411621 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,42351,00.html}} Retrieved on May 3, 2007.</ref>

==Production==
''Tragic Kingdom'' was recorded in eleven different studios in Los Angeles,<ref name="band"/> starting in March 1993 and finally being released two-and-a-half years later in October 1995.<ref name="band"/> During one of these recording sessions, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who had previously worked with [[Bush (band)|Bush]] and was interested in working on No Doubt's new album. After mixing the first single, "Just a Girl", Palmer went on to do the same to the rest of the record. He wanted to release the album on his own label, [[Trauma Records]], which was already associated with Interscope, and succeeded in getting the contract. This ensured that ''Tragic Kingdom'' got the focus that comes from a small company.<ref name="variety">{{cite journal |last=Sandler |first=Adam |title=Interscope facing Trauma in $100 million lawsuit |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 28, 1997 |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116677862.html?categoryid=16&cs=1|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |location=New York |issn=0042-2738 |oclc=1768958}} Retrieved on October 23, 2008.</ref>

==Music==
===Musical style===
''Tragic Kingdom'' uses elements of a variety of musical genres. [[Third-wave ska]] and [[ska punk]] (a fusion of [[ska]] and [[punk rock]]) are the genres most prominent on the album.<ref name="Erlewine"/><ref name="Fricke"/><ref name="christgau">{{cite web|url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=5939|title = No Doubt - Tragic Kingdom|accessdate = July 29, 2009|publisher = [[Robert Christgau]]}}</ref> The album also uses elements of [[New Wave music|New Wave]] and [[pop music|pop]],<ref name="34th"/><ref name="Browne"/> and dance rhythms influenced by [[reggae]], ska, [[flamenco]], and [[Tejano music|Tejano]], among others.<ref name="villagevoice">{{cite journal |last=Eddy |first=Chuck |title=She Bop |journal=[[The Village Voice]] |volume=41 |issue=16 |pages=60 |date=April 16, 1996 |publisher=Village Voice Media |location=New York |issn=0042-6180 |oclc=1696813}}</ref> Overall, the album was described as a "perfect mixture of ska and power ballad, horn sections and deep vibrato vocals, an inclusive pop style with a touch of classic punk" by ''[[34th Street Magazine]]''.<ref name="34th"/> [[Allmusic]] described it as "[straddling] the line between '90s punk, third-wave ska, and pop sensibility" and as an "appealing mix of new wave melodicism, post-grunge rock, and West Coast sunshine."<ref name="Erlewine"/>

===Lyrical content===
Many of the lyrics on ''Tragic Kingdom'' were written by lead vocalist Gwen Stefani, and were about her experiences in life. Those from ''No Doubt'' and ''The Beacon Street Collection'' were written mainly by Eric Stefani, who left the band after ''Tragic Kingdom'' was finished.<ref name=zelig/> Therefore, the style of music changed from what the band had previously produced. Guitarist [[Tom Dumont]] explained the change in sound in an interview for Backstage Online:

{{cquote|Well, there is a reason that the sound of our music has changed and it's not because we've sold out. Easy for me to say. Eric, our keyboard player, used to write most of our songs. He was the main creative force in the band for many years. And at a certain point after that first album came out, he had this personal thing, like he didn't like touring, he didn't like all that stuff. He just liked to sit down and write songs. That's him. He's the artistic side, the total Mr. Creative.<br/>
We have a simpler style. We're not quite genius like him I think. This album was our first attempt. It was Gwen's first time really writing all the lyrics herself so to me, it went the opposie [sic] from selling out[;] we have done something that is even more personal. In the past, Eric was writing songs about his life and having Gwen sing them. Now we have Gwen singing and writing about her own experiences. It makes it more natural. She's a singer, she should sing about herself or sing what she wants to sing. I think that is the main reason why our musical style has changed.<ref name=zelig>{{cite web |url=http://www.nodoubtonline.com/Pictures/Concerts/ConcertDirect/2/Index3.html|title=Interview with Tom Dumont |accessdate=July 29, 2009 |date=October 31, 1996 |publisher=No Doubt official website, rehosted due to site difficulties}}</ref>}}

==Reception==
===Release and impact===
''Tragic Kingdom'' was first released by Trauma/Interscope on October 10, 1995. The album did not appear on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart until the first week of January 1996.<ref name="mtv3">{{cite news |last=Basham |first=David |title=Got Charts?

No Doubt performed on the [[Warped Tour]], which was sponsored by several [[skateboarding]] companies, and at several skateboarding festivals. The album remained low on the ''Billboard'' 200 and did not enter the top hundred until February 1996, when it jumped twenty-seven positions to number 89. Palmer attributed the jump to a [[Channel One News]] program that Stefani hosted in January 1996, which was broadcast in twelve thousand classrooms, and the band's subsequent performance at a [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] store in [[Fresno, California]].<ref name="billboard6">{{cite journal |last=Borzillo |first=Carrie |date=February 10, 1996 |title=Trauma's No Doubt keeps faith |journal=Billboard |volume=108 |issue=6 |pages=11<U+2013>12 |publisher=VNU, Inc |location=New York |issn=0006-2510 |oclc=1532948}}</ref>

In May 1996, the band worked with [[HMV]], [[MuchMusic]], and the [[Universal Music Group]] to put on a global in-store promotion. The band performed and answered questions in MuchMusic's studios in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. The session was broadcast live to HMV stores worldwide and on a webcast so that fans could watch and ask the band questions through MuchMusic's [[VJ (media personality)|VJs]]. Sales of ''Tragic Kingdom'' doubled the week after the event. The event's sponsors lobbied ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' to create a category for the largest virtual in-store promotion to recognize the event.<ref name="marketing">{{cite journal |last=Smallbridge |first=Justin |date=June 16, 1997 |title=Show and sell |journal=[[Marketing (magazine)|Marketing]] |volume=102 |issue=23 |pages=15 |publisher=Rogers Media, Inc |location=Toronto |issn=1196-4650 |oclc=67031423}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
The album received mostly positive reviews from critics. [[David Fricke]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine gave a mostly positive review, describing ''Tragic Kingdom'' as "ear candy with good beats, not just bludgeon-by-numbers guitars" and its music as "a spry, white-suburban take on ska and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]esque pop". Fricke however described "Don't Speak" as "irritating swill" with "high-pitched rippling" from Gwen Stefani.<ref name="Fricke">{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nodoubt/albums/album/246985/review/5942423/tragic_kingdom |title=Album Reviews&nbsp;<U+2013> No Doubt&nbsp;<U+2013> Tragic Kingdom |date=December 9, 1996 |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |author=Fricke, David |publisher=''Rolling Stone''}}</ref> In 2003, the album was ranked number 441 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref name="rs500">{{cite journal |date=November 1, 2003 |title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |journal=Rolling Stone |issue=937 |pages=170 |publisher=Wenner Media, LLC |location=New York |issn=0035-791X |oclc=1787396}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine gave the album a C+ rating. Reviewer David Browne attributed the album's sales to Gwen Stefani's "leggy, bleached-blond calling card" and concluded that "sex still sells". Browne, however, described the music as "a hefty chunk of new-wave party bounce and [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|Chili Peppers]]-style white-boy funk, with dashes of [[reggae]], squealing [[Glam metal|hair-metal]] guitar, [[disco]], ska-band horns" and the band as sounding like "savvy, lounge-bred pros". Individual songs were singled out and commented on: "Just a Girl" was described as "a chirpy, ska-tinged bopper", "Don't Speak" as "an old-fangled power ballad", "Sixteen" as a "song of solidarity with misunderstood teenage girls", and "Spiderwebs" and "End It on This" as "[Stefani] acknowledg[ing] obsessions with losers and tr[ying] to break free."<ref name="Browne">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,293554,00.html |title=Music Review&nbsp;<U+2013> Tragic Kingdom (1995) |date=August 2, 1996 |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |author=Browne, David |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}</ref>

Calling the album a marked improvement over "the diffuse, rambling songwriting of [No Doubt's] two previous CDs", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Mike Boehm felt that on the album, "The band is bright, hard-hitting and kinetic, as sharp production captures the core, four-man instrumental team and adjunct horn section at their best".<ref name=LA>Boehm, Mike. "'Kingdom' Is Band's Best Yet, No Doubt". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. November 13, 1995.</ref> In a favourable review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', critic [[Chuck Eddy]] felt that although "[the album] turns pretentious ... No Doubt resurrects the exuberance [[New Wave music|new-wave]] guys lost when '80s indie labels and college radio conned them into settling for slam-pit fits and wallflower wallpaper".<ref name="villagevoice"/> [[Allmusic]] called it "pure fun" and described the music as something "between '90s punk, third-wave ska, and pop sensibility" and a mix of "new wave melodicism, [[post-grunge]] rock, and West Coast sunshine", indicating the songs "Spiderwebs", "Just a Girl", and "Don't Speak" as "positively [ruling] the airwaves".<ref name="Erlewine">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:8jmsa9tgu23u~T1 |title=Tragic Kingdom&nbsp;> Review |accessdate=October 27, 2008 |author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> [[Yahoo!

In a retrospective review in April 2009, Adrienne Warrell of ''[[34th Street Magazine]]'' called ''Tragic Kingdom'' a "perfect mixture of ska and power ballad, horn sections and deep vibrato vocals, an inclusive pop style with a touch of classic punk" and described its appeal to young teenagers.<ref name=34th>{{cite web|url = http://www.34st.com/content/2009/apr/no-doubt-tragic-kingdom-1995|title = No Doubt, "Tragic Kingdom" 1995|accessdate = July 26, 2009|publisher = [[34th Street Magazine]]}}</ref>

==Tour==
No Doubt embarked on the ''Tragic Kingdom'' Tour after the release of the album. It chose Project X, headed by [[Luc Lafortune]] and Michael Keeling, to design the stage. No Doubt suggested decorating the stage as a clearing in a forest. Project X created three anthropomorphic trees with glowing oranges. The show included clear and mylar confetti designed to look like rain. Lighting design was difficult because there were only four rehearsals, so the show was arranged to be flexible to allow for what Lafortune referred to as "a very kinetic performance".<ref name="tci">{{cite journal |last=McHugh |first=Catherine |year=1997 |month=August/September |title=Keys to the Kingdom |journal=Theatre Crafts International |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages= |publisher=Theatre Crafts Associates |location=New York |issn=1063-9497 |oclc=26180112}}</ref> The band expected to tour for two months, but the tour ended up lasting two and a half years.<ref name="vogue"/>
