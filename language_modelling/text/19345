==Biography==
===Early life===
Pang Tong was a native of Xiangyang [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (<U+8944><U+967D>; present-day [[Xiangyang]], [[Hubei]]). In his youth, he looked plain and simple, and was not held in high regard. When Pang Tong reached adulthood (around 19 years old), he visited [[Sima Hui]], who was famous for spotting and recommending men of talent. They came to a mulberry tree, where Sima Hui climbed up to get the fruit while Pang Tong sat below, and they conversed for a whole day until nightfall. Sima Hui felt that Pang Tong was an extraordinary person and remarked that Pang was the "crown of the scholars in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]". Since then, Pang Tong started gaining more recognition among the scholar-gentry.<ref>(...<U+8944><U+967D><U+4EBA><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+5C11><U+6642><U+6A38><U+920D><U+FF0C><U+672A><U+6709><U+8B58><U+8005><U+3002><U+6F41><U+5DDD><U+53F8><U+99AC><U+5FBD><U+6E05><U+96C5><U+6709><U+77E5><U+4EBA><U+9452><U+FF0C><U+7D71><U+5F31><U+51A0><U+5F80><U+898B><U+5FBD><U+FF0C><U+5FBD><U+63A1><U+6851><U+65BC><U+6A39><U+4E0A><U+FF0C><U+5750><U+7D71><U+5728><U+6A39><U+4E0B><U+FF0C><U+5171><U+8A9E><U+81EA><U+665D><U+81F3><U+591C><U+3002><U+5FBD><U+751A><U+7570><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+7A31><U+7D71><U+7576><U+70BA><U+5357><U+5DDE><U+58EB><U+4E4B><U+51A0><U+5195><U+FF0C><U+7531><U+662F><U+6F38><U+986F><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Pang Tong later served as an Officer of Merit (<U+529F><U+66F9>) in Nan Commandery (<U+5357><U+90E1>; in present-day [[Jingzhou]], [[Hubei]]). He was an appraiser, and his reviews on people were focused more on their personal virtues rather than their abilities. He was fond of ethical lessons and consistently strived to maintain his moral standards. He usually overpraised when he was asked to assess a person. At times, people were puzzled and questioned him on why he did that, to which he replied, "The nation is currently in a state of disorder. Good people are overwhelmed by the evil. I desire to change the social norm through encouraging good people by giving them a better (exaggerated) reputation, so they can serve as role models for others."<ref>(<U+5F8C><U+90E1><U+547D><U+70BA><U+529F><U+66F9><U+3002><U+6027><U+597D><U+4EBA><U+502B><U+FF0C><U+52E4><U+65BC><U+9577><U+990A><U+3002><U+6BCF><U+6240><U+7A31><U+8FF0><U+FF0C><U+591A><U+904E><U+5176><U+624D><U+FF0C><U+6642><U+4EBA><U+602A><U+800C><U+554F><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+7D71><U+8345><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+7576><U+4ECA><U+5929><U+4E0B><U+5927><U+4E82><U+FF0C><U+96C5><U+9053><U+9675><U+9072><U+FF0C><U+5584><U+4EBA><U+5C11><U+800C><U+60E1><U+4EBA><U+591A><U+3002><U+65B9><U+6B32><U+8208><U+98A8><U+4FD7><U+FF0C><U+9577><U+9053><U+696D><U+FF0C><U+4E0D><U+7F8E><U+5176><U+8B5A><U+5373><U+8072><U+540D><U+4E0D><U+8DB3><U+6155><U+4F01><U+FF0C><U+4E0D><U+8DB3><U+6155><U+4F01><U+800C><U+70BA><U+5584><U+8005><U+5C11><U+77E3><U+3002><U+4ECA><U+62D4><U+5341><U+5931><U+4E94><U+FF0C><U+7336><U+5F97><U+5176><U+534A><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+53EF><U+4EE5><U+5D07><U+9081><U+4E16><U+6559><U+FF0C><U+4F7F><U+6709><U+5FD7><U+8005><U+81EA><U+52F5><U+FF0C><U+4E0D><U+4EA6><U+53EF><U+4E4E><U+FF1F><U+300D>) Chen Shou.

In 209, [[Zhou Yu]], a general under the warlord [[Sun Quan]], occupied Nan Commandery after the [[Battle of Jiangling (208)|Battle of Jiangling]]. Zhou Yu was appointed Administrator (<U+592A><U+5B88>) of the commandery, and Pang continued to serve as an Officer of Merit under Zhou. When Zhou Yu died in 210, Pang Tong travelled to [[Jiangnan|Jiangdong]] to attend his funeral, where he was warmly received by many people, who had heard of him before. Pang Tong met [[Lu Ji (Gongji)|Lu Ji]] (<U+9678><U+7E3E>), [[Gu Shao]] (<U+9867><U+52AD>) and [[Quan Cong]], and he appraised each of them. They were all very pleased with Pang Tong's comments and they befriended him.<ref>(<U+5433><U+5C07><U+5468><U+745C><U+52A9><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+53D6><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+FF0C><U+56E0><U+9818><U+5357><U+90E1><U+592A><U+5B88><U+3002><U+745C><U+5352><U+FF0C><U+7D71><U+9001><U+55AA><U+81F3><U+5433><U+FF0C><U+5433><U+4EBA><U+591A><U+805E><U+5176><U+540D><U+3002><U+53CA><U+7576><U+897F><U+9084><U+FF0C><U+4E26><U+6703><U+660C><U+9580><U+FF0C><U+9678><U+7E3E><U+3001><U+9867><U+52AD><U+3001><U+5168><U+742E><U+7686><U+5F80><U+3002><U+7D71><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+9678><U+5B50><U+53EF><U+8B02><U+99D1><U+99AC><U+6709><U+9038><U+8DB3><U+4E4B><U+529B><U+FF0C><U+9867><U+5B50><U+53EF><U+8B02><U+99D1><U+725B><U+80FD><U+8CA0><U+91CD><U+81F4><U+9060><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+8B02><U+5168><U+742E><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+537F><U+597D><U+65BD><U+6155><U+540D><U+FF0C><U+6709><U+4F3C><U+6C5D><U+5357><U+6A0A><U+5B50><U+662D><U+3002><U+96D6><U+667A><U+529B><U+4E0D><U+591A><U+FF0C><U+4EA6><U+4E00><U+6642><U+4E4B><U+4F73><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+7E3E><U+3001><U+52AD><U+8B02><U+7D71><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+4F7F><U+5929><U+4E0B><U+592A><U+5E73><U+FF0C><U+7576><U+8207><U+537F><U+5171><U+6599><U+56DB><U+6D77><U+4E4B><U+58EB><U+3002><U+300D><U+6DF1><U+8207><U+7D71><U+76F8><U+7D50><U+800C><U+9084><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

===Serving Liu Bei in Jing Province===
Pang Tong later became a subject of [[Liu Bei]] when the latter became the Governor (<U+7267>) of [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]] in late 209. He initially served as an Assistant Officer (<U+5F9E><U+4E8B>) and as the Prefect of Leiyang (<U+8012><U+967D>; present-day [[Leiyang]], [[Hunan]]). However, he performed badly in office and was dismissed. Sun Quan's general [[Lu Su]] later wrote to Liu Bei, recommending Pang Tong as a talent. Liu Bei's strategist [[Zhuge Liang]] also recommended Pang Tong, so Liu Bei appointed Pang as an Assistant Officer in the Headquarters Office (<U+6CBB><U+4E2D><U+5F9E><U+4E8B>). Liu Bei's treatment towards Pang Tong was second to that of his treatment towards Zhuge Liang. He later appointed both Pang Tong and Zhuge Liang as "Military Advisor General of the Household" (<U+8ECD><U+5E2B><U+4E2D><U+90CE><U+5C07>).<ref>(<U+5148><U+4E3B><U+9818><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+FF0C><U+7D71><U+4EE5><U+5F9E><U+4E8B><U+5B88><U+8012><U+967D><U+4EE4><U+FF0C><U+5728><U+7E23><U+4E0D><U+6CBB><U+FF0C><U+514D><U+5B98><U+3002><U+5433><U+5C07><U+9B6F><U+8085><U+907A><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+66F8><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+9F90><U+58EB><U+5143><U+975E><U+767E><U+91CC><U+624D><U+4E5F><U+FF0C><U+4F7F><U+8655><U+6CBB><U+4E2D><U+3001><U+5225><U+99D5><U+4E4B><U+4EFB><U+FF0C><U+59CB><U+7576><U+5C55><U+5176><U+9A65><U+8DB3><U+8033><U+3002><U+300D><U+8AF8><U+845B><U+4EAE><U+4EA6><U+8A00><U+4E4B><U+65BC><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+FF0C><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+898B><U+8207><U+5584><U+8B5A><U+FF0C><U+5927><U+5668><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+70BA><U+6CBB><U+4E2D><U+5F9E><U+4E8B><U+3002><U+89AA><U+5F85><U+4E9E><U+65BC><U+8AF8><U+845B><U+4EAE><U+FF0C><U+9042><U+8207><U+4EAE><U+4E26><U+70BA><U+8ECD><U+5E2B><U+4E2D><U+90CE><U+5C07><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

===Assisting Liu Bei in the conquest of Yi Province===
{{see|Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province}}

Around the early 210s, Pang Tong successfully persuaded [[Liu Bei]] to seize Yi Province (covering present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) in western China and use its resources to compete with [[Cao Cao]] for supremacy over China. Liu Bei agreed to Pang Tong's suggestion.<ref>(<U+4E5D><U+5DDE><U+6625><U+79CB><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+7D71><U+8AAA><U+5099><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+8352><U+6B98><U+FF0C><U+4EBA><U+7269><U+6BAB><U+76E1><U+FF0C><U+6771><U+6709><U+5433><U+5B6B><U+FF0C><U+5317><U+6709><U+66F9><U+6C0F><U+FF0C><U+9F0E><U+8DB3><U+4E4B><U+8A08><U+FF0C><U+96E3><U+4EE5><U+5F97><U+5FD7><U+3002><U+4ECA><U+76CA><U+5DDE><U+570B><U+5BCC><U+6C11><U+5F4A><U+FF0C><U+6236><U+53E3><U+767E><U+842C><U+FF0C><U+56DB><U+90E8><U+5175><U+99AC><U+FF0C><U+6240><U+51FA><U+5FC5><U+5177><U+FF0C><U+5BF6><U+8CA8><U+7121><U+6C42><U+65BC><U+5916><U+FF0C><U+4ECA><U+53EF><U+6B0A><U+501F><U+4EE5><U+5B9A><U+5927><U+4E8B><U+3002><U+300D><U+5099><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+4ECA><U+6307><U+8207><U+543E><U+70BA><U+6C34><U+706B><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+66F9><U+64CD><U+4E5F><U+FF0C><U+64CD><U+4EE5><U+6025><U+FF0C><U+543E><U+4EE5><U+5BEC><U+FF1B><U+64CD><U+4EE5><U+66B4><U+FF0C><U+543E><U+4EE5><U+4EC1><U+FF1B><U+64CD><U+4EE5><U+8B4E><U+FF0C><U+543E><U+4EE5><U+5FE0><U+FF1B><U+6BCF><U+8207><U+64CD><U+53CD><U+FF0C><U+4E8B><U+4E43><U+53EF><U+6210><U+8033><U+3002><U+4ECA><U+4EE5><U+5C0F><U+6545><U+800C><U+5931><U+4FE1><U+7FA9><U+65BC><U+5929><U+4E0B><U+8005><U+FF0C><U+543E><U+6240><U+4E0D><U+53D6><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+7D71><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+6B0A><U+8B8A><U+4E4B><U+6642><U+FF0C><U+56FA><U+975E><U+4E00><U+9053><U+6240><U+80FD><U+5B9A><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+517C><U+5F31><U+653B><U+6627><U+FF0C><U+4E94><U+4F2F><U+4E4B><U+4E8B><U+3002><U+9006><U+53D6><U+9806><U+5B88><U+FF0C><U+5831><U+4E4B><U+4EE5><U+7FA9><U+FF0C><U+4E8B><U+5B9A><U+4E4B><U+5F8C><U+FF0C><U+5C01><U+4EE5><U+5927><U+570B><U+FF0C><U+4F55><U+8CA0><U+65BC><U+4FE1><U+FF1F><U+4ECA><U+65E5><U+4E0D><U+53D6><U+FF0C><U+7D42><U+70BA><U+4EBA><U+5229><U+8033><U+3002><U+300D><U+5099><U+9042><U+884C><U+3002>) Annotations from ''Jiuzhou Chunqiu'' to Chen Shou's ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 37, Biography of Pang Tong.</ref> In 211, Liu Bei led an army from Jing Province into Yi Province on the pretext of helping Yi Province's governor [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]] counter an invasion from the warlord [[Zhang Lu (Han Dynasty)|Zhang Lu]] in [[Hanzhong]].

Liu Zhang received Liu Bei at Fu (<U+6DAA>; in present-day [[Fuling District]], [[Chongqing]]). Pang Tong urged Liu Bei to use the opportunity to capture Liu Zhang and force the latter to hand over Yi Province, but Liu Bei refused on the grounds that he was new to Yi Province and had yet to establish a strong reputation there yet. Liu Zhang later returned to Yi Province's capital [[Chengdu]].<ref>(<U+76CA><U+5DDE><U+7267><U+5289><U+748B><U+8207><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+6703><U+6DAA><U+FF0C><U+7D71><U+9032><U+7B56><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+4ECA><U+56E0><U+6B64><U+6703><U+FF0C><U+4FBF><U+53EF><U+57F7><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+5247><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+7121><U+7528><U+5175><U+4E4B><U+52DE><U+FF0C><U+800C><U+5750><U+5B9A><U+4E00><U+5DDE><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+521D><U+5165><U+4ED6><U+570B><U+FF0C><U+6069><U+4FE1><U+672A><U+8457><U+FF0C><U+6B64><U+4E0D><U+53EF><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+748B><U+65E3><U+9084><U+6210><U+90FD><U+FF0C><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+7576><U+70BA><U+748B><U+5317><U+5F81><U+6F22><U+4E2D><U+FF0C>...)

Pang Tong then outlined three plans for Liu Bei to choose from:
* The upper plan: Select the best soldiers to form an elite force and advance quickly towards Chengdu, and force Liu Zhang to surrender and hand over Yi Province. Pang Tong also commented that Liu Zhang was not competent in military affairs and was unprepared, so the chances of success were high.
* The middle plan: Spread false news that Liu Bei was returning to Jing Province, then lure Liu Zhang's generals [[Yang Huai]] and [[Gao Pei]] (<U+9AD8><U+6C9B>) away from the fortified mountain passes they were defending, kill them and take control of their positions and troops, and finally advance towards Chengdu.
* The lower plan: Retreat to [[Baidicheng]] near Jing Province and wait for another opportunity to attack.

Liu Bei chose the middle plan and executed it - he killed Yang Huai and Gao Pei and led his forces towards Chengdu, conquering several of Liu Zhang's territories along the way.<ref>(...<U+7D71><U+5FA9><U+8AAA><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+9670><U+9078><U+7CBE><U+5175><U+FF0C><U+665D><U+591C><U+517C><U+9053><U+FF0C><U+5F91><U+8972><U+6210><U+90FD><U+FF1B><U+748B><U+65E3><U+4E0D><U+6B66><U+FF0C><U+53C8><U+7D20><U+7121><U+9810><U+5099><U+FF0C><U+5927><U+8ECD><U+5352><U+81F3><U+FF0C><U+4E00><U+8209><U+4FBF><U+5B9A><U+FF0C><U+6B64><U+4E0A><U+8A08><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+694A><U+61F7><U+3001><U+9AD8><U+6C9B><U+FF0C><U+748B><U+4E4B><U+540D><U+5C07><U+FF0C><U+5404><U+6756><U+5F4A><U+5175><U+FF0C><U+64DA><U+5B88><U+95DC><U+982D><U+FF0C><U+805E><U+6578><U+6709><U+724B><U+8AEB><U+748B><U+FF0C><U+4F7F><U+767C><U+9063><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+9084><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+3002><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+672A><U+81F3><U+FF0C><U+9063><U+8207><U+76F8><U+805E><U+FF0C><U+8AAA><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+6709><U+6025><U+FF0C><U+6B32><U+9084><U+6551><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+4E26><U+4F7F><U+88DD><U+675F><U+FF0C><U+5916><U+4F5C><U+6B78><U+5F62><U+FF1B><U+6B64><U+4E8C><U+5B50><U+65E3><U+670D><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+82F1><U+540D><U+FF0C><U+53C8><U+559C><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+4E4B><U+53BB><U+FF0C><U+8A08><U+5FC5><U+4E58><U+8F15><U+9A0E><U+4F86><U+898B><U+FF0C><U+5C07><U+8ECD><U+56E0><U+6B64><U+57F7><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+9032><U+53D6><U+5176><U+5175><U+FF0C><U+4E43><U+5411><U+6210><U+90FD><U+FF0C><U+6B64><U+4E2D><U+8A08><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+9000><U+9084><U+767D><U+5E1D><U+FF0C><U+9023><U+5F15><U+834A><U+5DDE><U+FF0C><U+5F90><U+9084><U+5716><U+4E4B><U+FF0C><U+6B64><U+4E0B><U+8A08><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+82E5><U+6C88><U+541F><U+4E0D><U+53BB><U+FF0C><U+5C07><U+81F4><U+5927><U+56F0><U+FF0C><U+4E0D><U+53EF><U+4E46><U+77E3><U+3002><U+300D><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+7136><U+5176><U+4E2D><U+8A08><U+FF0C><U+5373><U+65AC><U+61F7><U+3001><U+6C9B><U+FF0C><U+9084><U+5411><U+6210><U+90FD><U+FF0C><U+6240><U+904E><U+8F12><U+514B><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Liu Bei expressed joy during a banquet in Fu to celebrate his victory over Liu Zhang so far, and Pang Tong chided him, saying that "celebrating the invasion of others' territory is not what a man of ''ren'' (<U+4EC1>; a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] value which advocates showing kindness) should do". The drunk Liu Bei retorted angrily, "[[King Wu of Zhou]] also rejoiced after his victory over [[King Zhou of Shang]]. Is he not an example of a man of ''ren''? You're wrong, so get out now!" After Pang Tong left, Liu Bei regretted for making that response and invited Pang back. Pang Tong returned to his seat and did not say anything, so Liu Bei asked, "When that quarrel happened just now, whose fault did you think it was?" Pang Tong replied, "It was both yours and mine." Liu Bei laughed and the banquet continued.<ref>(<U+65BC><U+6DAA><U+5927><U+6703><U+FF0C><U+7F6E><U+9152><U+4F5C><U+6A02><U+FF0C><U+8B02><U+7D71><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+4ECA><U+65E5><U+4E4B><U+6703><U+FF0C><U+53EF><U+8B02><U+6A02><U+77E3><U+3002><U+300D><U+7D71><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+4F10><U+4EBA><U+4E4B><U+570B><U+800C><U+4EE5><U+70BA><U+6B61><U+FF0C><U+975E><U+4EC1><U+8005><U+4E4B><U+5175><U+4E5F><U+3002><U+300D><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+9189><U+FF0C><U+6012><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+6B66><U+738B><U+4F10><U+7D02><U+FF0C><U+524D><U+6B4C><U+5F8C><U+821E><U+FF0C><U+975E><U+4EC1><U+8005><U+90AA><U+FF1F><U+537F><U+8A00><U+4E0D><U+7576><U+FF0C><U+5B9C><U+901F><U+8D77><U+51FA><U+FF01><U+300D><U+65BC><U+662F><U+7D71><U+9021><U+5DE1><U+5F15><U+9000><U+3002><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+5C0B><U+6094><U+FF0C><U+8ACB><U+9084><U+3002><U+7D71><U+5FA9><U+6545><U+4F4D><U+FF0C><U+521D><U+4E0D><U+9867><U+8B1D><U+FF0C><U+98F2><U+98DF><U+81EA><U+82E5><U+3002><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+8B02><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+5411><U+8005><U+4E4B><U+8AD6><U+FF0C><U+963F><U+8AB0><U+70BA><U+5931><U+FF1F><U+300D><U+7D71><U+5C0D><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+300C><U+541B><U+81E3><U+4FF1><U+5931><U+3002><U+300D><U+5148><U+4E3B><U+5927><U+7B11><U+FF0C><U+5BB4><U+6A02><U+5982><U+521D><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Pang Tong later participated in a battle against [[Liu Zhang (warlord)|Liu Zhang]]'s forces at Luo County (<U+96D2><U+7E23>; north of present-day [[Guanghan]], [[Sichuan]]).

Pang Tong had a younger brother, Pang Lin (<U+9F90><U+6797>), who served as an Assistant Officer in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Province]]'s Headquarters Office (<U+834A><U+5DDE><U+6CBB><U+4E2D><U+5F9E><U+4E8B>). He participated in the [[Battle of Xiaoting]] in 221-222 together with the general [[Huang Quan (Three Kingdoms)|Huang Quan]].
