The '''Sun Kosi''' or '''Matsang Tsangpo''' ({{lang-ne|<U+0938><U+0941><U+0928><U+0915><U+094B><U+0936><U+0940>}}) is a [[trans-boundary river]]  and  is part of the [[Koshi River|Kosi]] or Sapta Kosi river system in [[Nepal]]. It originates in [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]]. 

==Etymology==
Sun Kosi or Sona Kosi means river of gold. In the local languages ''sona'' means gold and ''kosi'' means river. It could have been so named because of the gold sometimes picked up with the gravels, or because of the colour of the water loaded with alluvium during the monsoons.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8897ridkczoC&pg=PA429&lpg=PA429&dq=Sona+Kosi&source=bl&ots=GVkT0rtO1J&sig=MFv84BZvpzYK-9k5hPu3jcbavDk&hl=en&ei=rKXvS925MoyWrAfQgPWTBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Sona%20Kosi&f=false | title =Encyclopaedia of ancient Indian geography | work =p. 429 | first=Subodh | last=Kapoor | publisher =Google books |accessdate = 2010-05-15}}</ref>The Sun Kosi is known as Matsang Tsangpo in Tibet.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://tibetmaster.com/Destination_Guide/Shigatse_Villages/Dingri%20County%20,tibet%20tour.html | title =Dingri County | work = | first=| last= | publisher = Tibet Master.com |accessdate = 2010-05-15}}</ref> The suffix [[Tsangpo]] denotes a river flowing from or through [[<U+00DC>-Tsang|''Tsang'']], i.e. Tibet west of [[Lhasa]].

==Kosi river system==
The Kosi or Sapt Kosi drains eastern Nepal. It is known as Sapt Koshi because of the seven rivers which join together in east-central Nepal to form this river. The main rivers forming the Kosi system are <U+2013> the Sun Kosi River, the [[Indravati River, Nepal|Indravati River]], the [[Bhote Koshi]], the [[Dudh Kosi]], the [[Arun River, Tibet-Nepal|Arun River]], [[Barun River]], and [[Tamur River]]. The combined river flows through the Chatra gorge in a southerly direction to emerge from the hills.<ref name=negi>{{cite web|url = http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5YtUShKY8zcC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=Himalayan+rivers+Negi+Sun+kosi&source=bl&ots=_HegZ9tvi0&sig=LBfqD_upzK4XiqvS9l8iEDBXuMo&hl=en&ei=Hg7uS__cL4TDrAfhxMiTBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false  | title =Himalayan rivers, lakes and glaciers | work = Kosi River System, p. 89 | first= Sharad Singh  | last= Negi| publisher = Google books |accessdate = 2010-05-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fgxQSBwOe0QC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=Sunkosi+Barun&source=bl&ots=uRyk_6OlUA&sig=mX4RyKc-B7OppsdhB_DX-d3orNA&hl=en&ei=oBPuS67fBIKmrQewsb2TBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Himalayan snow and glaciers: associated environmental problems, progress| work = Kosi, p. 90    | first=Jagdish  | last=Bahadur  | publisher = Google books. |accessdate = 2010-05-14}}</ref>

The westernmost part of [[<U+00DC>-Tsang|Tsang]] province is traditionally known as Lato, the highland region of Tibet. North Lato comprises the upper reaches of the [[Brahmaputra River|Yarlung Tsangpo]] and Raga Tsangpo. South Lato comprises the upper reaches of Matsang Tsangpo, [[Arun River, Tibet-Nepal|Bum-chu]], and [[Trishuli River|Kyirong Tsangpo]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://books.google.co.in/books?id=DDLAqIckCHkC&pg=PA296&lpg=PA296&dq=Tibet+handbook:+with+Bhutan+Dingri+County&source=bl&ots=AlwfgzEcJt&sig=YC_YHcQILSATecuEsNNJJo5vZrY&hl=en&ei=xSz2S4HXG5S5rAeqpeHJCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false  | title =Footprint Tibet handbook: with Bhutan | work =  Dingri County, p. 296 | first=Gyurme  | last=Dorje  | publisher =Google books |accessdate = 2010-05-18}}</ref>

==Sun Kosi-Kamala multipurpose project==
The Sun Kosi has a 90 per cent reliable flow of {{convert|126|m3/s}}. It has been proposed that water be diverted from a small [[weir]] across the river near Kurule through a {{convert|16.6|km}} tunnel and a 61.4 MW associated power house to the [[Kamala River]], flowing through central Nepal. Some {{convert|72|m3/s}} of water would be transferred to the Kamala River for the purposes of irrigation and further generation of power.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://books.google.co.in/books?id=cgYwDW13ILoC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Kamala+River&source=bl&ots=bRsQormGdI&sig=64-qbkeWmgv3dIiBcgjzo9r1XFE&hl=en&ei=E1flS5ekJ8m8rAec3dXmAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=Kamala%20River&f=false | title =The Nepal-India Water Relationship: Challenges | work = p. 91|first=  |last= Dwarika N.
