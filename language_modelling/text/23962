'''Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet''' [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of Australia|AK]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ([[3 September]] [[1899]] <U+2013> [[31 August]] [[1985]]), usually known as '''Macfarlane''' or '''Mac Burnet''', was an Australian [[virology|virologist]] best known for his contributions to [[immunology]]. Burnet received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1924, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of London]] in 1928. He went on to conduct pioneering research on [[bacteriophage]]s and [[virus]]es at the [[Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research|Walter and Eliza Hall Institute]], and served as director of the Institute from 1944 to 1956. His [[virology]] research resulted in significant discoveries concerning their nature and replication and their interaction with the [[immune system]]. 

From the mid-1950s, he worked extensively in immunology and was a major contributor to the theory of [[clonal selection]], which explains how [[lymphocyte]]s target [[antigen]]s for destruction. Burnet and [[Peter Medawar]] were co-recipients of the 1960 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for demonstrating acquired [[immune tolerance]]. This research provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, the platform for developing methods of [[organ transplant|transplanting]] solid organs.

Burnet left the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1956, he continued to work at the University of Melbourne until his official retirement in 1978. During his working life he wrote 31 books and monographs and more than 500 scientific papers. Burnet played an active role in the development of public policy for the medical sciences in Australia, and was a founding member and later the president, of the [[Australian Academy of Science]]. He was the most highly decorated and honoured scientist to have worked in Australia.<ref name = "Fenner">Fenner, F. 1987. Frank Macfarlane Burnet. ''Historical Records of Australian Science'' 7:39<U+2013>77.</ref> For his contributions to Australian science, he was made the first [[Australian of the Year]] in 1960, and in 1978 a Knight of the [[Order of Australia]]. He was recognised internationally for his achievements: in addition to the Nobel, he received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research|Lasker Award]] and the [[Royal Medal|Royal]] and [[Copley Medal]]s from the [[Royal Society]], honorary doctorates, and distinguished service honours from the Commonwealth and Japan. 

==Early life==
Burnet was born in [[Traralgon, Victoria]]; his father, Frank Burnet, a Scottish emigrant to Australia, was the manager of the Traralgon branch of the Colonial Bank. He was the second of seven children and from childhood was known as "Mac". The Burnets moved to [[Terang, Victoria|Terang]] in 1909. Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby [[Lake Terang|lake]]; he joined the [[Scouts Australia|Scouts]] in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activates. While living in Terang, he began to collect [[beetle]]s and study biology. He read biology articles in the ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]'', which introduced him to the work of [[Charles Darwin]]. He was educated at Victorian state schools and later won a full scholarship to board and study at [[The Geelong College|Geelong College]], one of Victoria's most exclusive private schools.<ref>Sexton 1999, p. 20.</ref>

From 1917, Burnet attended the [[University of Melbourne]], where he lived in [[Ormond College (University of Melbourne)|Ormond College]] on a residential scholarship and studied medicine. There, he read more of Darwin<U+2019>s work and was influenced by the ideas of science and society in the writings of [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]]. While at university, he became an [[agnostic]]; he was sceptical of religious faith, which he regarded as "an effort to believe what common sense tells you isn't true."<ref>Sexton 1999, p. 27.</ref> The length of time required to study medicine had been reduced to train doctors faster following the outbreak of [[World War I]],<!--from 6 to 5 years--> and Burnet graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1922, and as a Doctor of Medicine late in 1924. In 1924 he was appointed resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinin]] reactions in [[typhoid fever]], leading to his first scientific publications. 

The director of the Institute, [[Charles Kellaway]], thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group in Australia.<ref>Sexton 1999, p. 50.</ref> Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the [[The Lister Institute for Preventative Medicine|Lister Institute]] in London. He was awarded the Beit memorial fellowship by the Lister Institute in 1926 and began full-time research on [[bacteriophage]]. For this work he received a PhD from the [[University of London]] in 1928 and was invited to write a chapter on phage for the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s ''System of Bacteriology''. While in London, Burnet became engaged to fellow Australian Edith Linda Druce. They married in 1928 after returning to Australia, and had a son and two daughters.

==Walter and Eliza Hall Institute==
===Virology===
When Burnet returned to Australia, he went back to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, where he was appointed assistant director. His first assignment was to investigate the "Bundaberg disaster", in which 12 children had died after receiving a contaminated [[diphtheria]] vaccine. He identified ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in the toxin-[[antitoxin]] mixture that had been administered to the children, although turned out to be another toxin that had caused the children's deaths; this work on staphylococcal toxin piqued his interest in immunology.<ref>Sexton 1999, pp. 66<U+2013>67.</ref> During this time, he continued to study bacteriophage, writing 32 papers on phages between 1924 and 1937. In 1929, Burnet and his graduate assistant Margot McKie wrote a paper suggesting that bacteriophage could exist as a stable non-infectious form that multiplies with the bacterial host.<ref>Burnet, F.M. and McKie, M. 1929 Observations on a permanently lysogenic strain of B. enteritidis Gaertner. ''Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science'' 6:277<U+2013>84.</ref> Their pioneering description of [[lysogeny]] was not accepted until much later, and was crucial to the work of [[Max Delbr<U+00FC>ck]], [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Salvador Luria]] on the replication mechanism and genetics of viruses, for which they were awarded the 1969 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].

[[Image:Coxiella burnetii 01.JPG|left|200px|thumb|''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', the causative agent of [[Q fever]], was named after Burnet.]]
Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took leave of absence to undertake a fellowship at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in London. Significant breakthroughs in virology were made while he was there, including the isolation and first demonstration of the transmission of the [[influenza]] virus. His own research was on the [[canarypox virus]], which he used in developing a chick embryo assay for the isolation and quantification of animal viruses. When Burnet returned to Australia, he continued his work on virology, including the [[epidemiology]] of [[herpes simplex]]. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of [[psittacosis]] and [[Q fever]]. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'' in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the lab.<ref>Sexton 1999, p. 95.</ref> His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed  an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.<ref>Sexton 1999, p. 96.</ref>
[[Image:Burnet in the lab.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Burnet working in the lab in 1945.]]
During [[World War II]], Burnet's research moved to [[influenza]] and [[scrub typhus]]. His first book, ''Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease'', was published in 1940. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to [[Harvard University]] to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. In 1944, he was appointed director of the Institute when Kellaway was appointed director of the [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome Foundation]]. Under his direction, scientists at the Institute made significant contributions to infectious disease research during a period that has been called the "golden age of virology".<ref name = "Goding">Goding, J. [http://www.immunology.org.au/burnet.html Sir Frank Macfarlane Brunet]. Australasian Society for Immunology.</ref> Virologists including [[Alick Isaacs]], [[Gordon Ada]], [[John Cairns (biochemist)|John Cairns]], [[Stephen Fazekas de St. Groth]], and [[Frank Fenner]] made significant contributions on [[Murray Valley encephalitis]], [[myxomatosis]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[Poxviridae|poxviruses]], herpes and influenza. 

Burnet made significant contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including [[hemagglutination]] assays. He worked on a live vaccine against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the [[neuraminidase]] that is secreted by ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', which later provided the foundation for [[Alfred Gottschalk (biochemist)|Alfred Gottschalk]]'s significant work on [[glycoprotein]]s and the neuraminidase substrate, [[sialic acid]]. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.<ref name = "Fenner"/><ref>Burnet, F.M. 1956. Structure of the influenza virus. ''Science'' 123:1101<U+2013>04 PMID 13324158</ref>

===Immunology===
[[Image:Clonal selection.svg|right|220px|thumb|'''Clonal selection''' (1) A [[Pluripotential hemopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic stem cell]] undergoes differentiation and genetic rearrangement to produce (2) immature lymphocytes with many different antigen receptors.  Those that bind to (3) antigens from the body's own tissues are destroyed, while the rest mature into (4) inactive lymphocytes.  Most of these will never encounter a matching (5) foreign antigen, but those that do are activated and produce (6) many clones of themselves.]]
In the mid-1950s, Burnet decided that research at the Institute should focus on immunology. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the [[Australian National University]]'s [[John Curtin School of Medical Research]].<ref name ="Doherty">Doherty, P.C. 1999. Burnet Oration: Living in the Burnet lineage. ''Immunology and Cell Biology'' 77:167<U+2013>76. PMID 10234553</ref> After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune disease]]s and the [[Graft-versus-host disease|graft-versus-host]] reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.<ref name = "Fenner"/> 

Burnet began to write about immunology in the 1940s. In 1941 he wrote a [[monograph]] called the "The Production of Antibodies", which was revised and reissued in 1949 with Frank Fenner as a co-author. This book is seen as a key publication in immunology<U+2014>it marks the move from the study of immunology as a chemical endeavour to a biological one. Importantly in this work, he introduced the concept of "self" and "non-self" to immunology. The distinction between self and non-self was an integral part of Burnet<U+2019>s biological outlook, of his interest in the living organism in its totality, its activities, and interactions.<ref name = "Christ">Christ, E. and Tauber, A.I. 1999. Selfhood, Immunity, and the Biological Imagination: The Thought of Frank Macfarlane Burnet. ''Biology and Philosophy''. 15:509<U+2013>33.</ref> Burnet regarded that the "self" of the host body was actively defined during its embryogenesis through complex interactions between immune cells and all the other cells and molecules within an embryo.<ref>Park, H.W. 2006. Germs, Hosts, and the Origin of Frank Macfarlane Burnet<U+2019>s Concept of "Self" and "Tolerance", 1936<U+2013>1949. ''Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences''. 61:492-534</ref> 

Using the concept of self, Burnet introduced a hypothesis about the situation where the body failed to make antibodies to its own components ([[autoimmunity]]) [autoimmunity results when the body makes antibodies to its own components, not when it fails to do so] and by extension the idea of [[immune tolerance]]. He proposed that 
<blockquote>if in embryonic life expendable cells from a genetically distinct race are implanted and established, no antibody response should develop against the foreign cell antigen when the animal takes on independent existence.<ref>Burnet, F.M., and Fenner, F. 1949. The Production of Antibodies. 2nd edition. Macmillan.</ref></blockquote>
Burnet was, however, unable to prove this experimentally.<ref>Burnet, F.M., Stone, J.D. and Edney, M. 1950. The failure of antibody production in the chick embryo. ''Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science''. 28:291<U+2013>97. PMID 14772171</ref> [[Peter Medawar]], [[Rupert E. Billingham]] and [[Leslie Brent]] did in 1953 when they showed that [[splenocyte]]s could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not from any other mouse strain.<ref>Billingham, R.E., Brent, L. and Medawar, P.B. 1953. 'Actively Acquired Tolerance' of Foreign Cells. ''Nature'' 172:603<U+2013>6. PMID 14657674</ref> Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet noted that his contributions to immune tolerance were just theoretical:
<blockquote>My part in the discovery of acquired immunological tolerance was a very minor one&mdash;it was the formulation of an hypothesis that called for experiment.<ref>Burnet, F.M. 1960. Nobel Lecture: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1960/burnet-lecture.pdf Immunological Recognition of Self]</ref></blockquote>

Burnet was interested in how the body produces antibodies in response to antigens. The dominant idea in the literature through the 1940s was that the antigen acted as a template for antibody production, which was known as the "instructive" hypothesis.<ref>Pauling, L. 1940 A theory of the structure and process of formation of antibodies. ''Journal of the American Chemical Society'' 62:2643.</ref> Burnet was not satisfied with this explanation, and in the second edition of "The Production of Antibodies", he and Fenner advanced an indirect template theory which proposed that each antigen could influence the genome, thus effecting the production of antibodies.<ref>Silverstein, A.M. 1989. ''A History of Immunology''. Academic Press Inc. ISBN 0-12-643770-X.</ref> In 1956 he became interested in [[Niels Kaj Jerne]]'s natural selection hypothesis, which described a mechanism for immune response based on an earlier theory of Nobel-winning immunologist [[Paul Ehrlich]]. Jerne proposed that the antigen bound to an antibody by chance and, that upon binding, more antibodies to that antigen would be produced. Burnet developed a model which he named [[clonal selection]] that expanded on and improved Jerne's hypothesis.<ref>Burnet, F.M. 1957. A modification of Jerne's theory of antibody production using the concept of clonal selection. ''Australian Journal Science'' 20:67<U+2013>69. PMID 816431</ref> Burnet proposed that each [[lymphocyte]] bears on its surface specific immunoglobulins reflecting the specificity of the antibody that will later be synthesised once the cell is activated by an antigen. The antigen serves as a selective stimulus, causing preferential proliferation and differentiation of
the clones that have receptors for that antigen.<ref name = "Nossal Nature">Nossal, G.J.V. 1985. Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet (1899<U+2013>1985). ''Nature'' 317:108. PMID 3897872</ref>

In 1958 [[Gustav Nossal]] and [[Joshua Lederberg]] showed that one [[B cell]] always produces only one antibody, which was the first evidence for clonal selection theory.<ref>Nossal, G.J.V. and Lederberg, J. 1958. Antibody production by single cells. ''Nature'' 181:1419<U+2013>20. PMID 13552693 </ref> Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book ''The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity''. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and [[somatic hypermutation]] as a mechanism in antibody production.<ref>Nossal, G.J.V. 1995 One Cell - One Antibody. In: ''Immunology: The making of a modern science''. Eds Gallagher, R.B., Gilder, J., Nossal, G.J.V., and Salvatore, G. Academic Press. pp. 39<U+2013>47.</ref> The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, and wrote that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work.<ref>Sexton 1999, pp. 139<U+2013>40.</ref> Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immmune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.

There is some contention over Burnet's publication of his version of the theory in the ''Australian Journal of Science'' in 1957. Some commentators argue he published in an Australian journal to fast-track his hypothesis and obtain priority for his theory over ideas that were published later that year in a paper written by [[David Talmage]], which Burnet had read prior to its publication.<ref name = "Fenner"><ref>Talmage, D.W. 1957. Allergy and immunology. ''Annual Review of Medicine'' 8:239<U+2013>56.</ref><ref>Forsdyke, D.R. 1995. [http://post.queensu.ca/~forsdyke/theorimm0.htm#Introduction The Origins of the Clonal Selection Theory of Immunity] ''FASEB. Journal'' 9:164<U+2013>66 PMID 7781918</ref> In his paper Burnet cited Talmage's review, and in a later interview, Talmage said he believed that Burnet "truthfully had developed the idea before he received my paper".<ref>Cruse, J.M. and Lewis, R.E. 1994 David W. Talmage and the advent of the cell selection theory of antibody synthesis. ''Journal of Immunology'' 153:919<U+2013>24 PMID 8027564</ref> The theory is now sometimes known as Burnet<U+2019>s clonal selection theory, which overlooks the contributions of Ehrlich, Jerne, Talmage, and the contributions of Lederberg, who conceptualised the genetics of clonal selection. 

Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in collaboration with 
Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this was known as the Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain [[passenger leukocyte]]s in transplantation.<ref name ="Fenner"/> The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous antuimmune [autoimmune] [[hemolytic anemia]]. They looked at the inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug [[cyclophosphamide]] to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human antoimmune [autoimmune] disease.<ref>Russell, P.J., Hicks, J.D., and Burnet, F.M. 1966 Cyclophosphamide treatment of kidney disease in (NZB x NZW) F1 mice. ''Lancet'' 1:1279<U+2013>84''. PMID 4160875</ref> He continued to be active in the lab until his retirement in 1965; Gustav Nossal became the next director of The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Under Burnet's leadership the Institute had become "probably the world's best known research centre devoted to the study of immunology."<ref>Marchalonis, J.J. 1994. Burnet and Nossal: the impact on immunology of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 69:53-67 PMID 8208917</ref>

==Public health and policy==
From 1937 Burnet was involved in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation with the media if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics.<ref name = "Fenner"/>

Burnet served as a member or chairman of scientific committees, both in Australia and overseas. Between 1947 and 1953, he was a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council <U+2013> Medical Research Advisory Committee. The committee advised on funding for medical research in Australia. During this same period (1947<U+2013>52), he was also a member of the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth government]]'s Defence Research and Development Policy Committee. Declassified files from this committee show that Burnet made the recommendation that Australia pursue development of chemical and biological weapons to target neighbouring countries' food stocks and spread infectious diseases.<ref>[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/imagine.asp?B=3039064&I=1&SE=0 Biological warfare - Remarks by Sir Macfarlane Burnet]. National Archives of Australia.</ref> Between 1955 and 1959, he was chairman of the Australian Radiation Advisory Committee; he was concerned that Australians were being exposed to unnecessary medical and industrial radiation.<ref name ="Fenner"/> 

Internationally, Burnet was a chairman of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. His role on the committee enabled his interest in [[human biology]]. He was particularly interested in [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet served as first chair the [[Commonwealth Foundation]] (1966-69), a Commonwealth initiative to foster intraction [interaction] between the member countries [countries']elite, and he was also active in the [[World Health Organization]], serving on the Expert Advisory Panels on Virus Diseases and on Immunology between 1952 and 1969 and the World Health Organization Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1969 and 1973. 

Burnet was opposed to the use of nuclear power in Australia due [owing] to the issues of [[nuclear proliferation]]. He later retracted his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were developed.<ref>Sexton 1999, pp. 214<U+2013>15; 232<U+2013>34.</ref> In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; he was one of the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and appeared in an advertisement criticising the ethics of [[tobacco advertising]].<ref>Sexton. 1999. p174-75.</ref>

==Later life==
Following his resignation from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Burnet was offered an office at the [[University of Melbourne]] in the School of Microbiology. While at the university, he wrote 13 books on a variety of topics including immunology, ageing and cancer and human biology. He also wrote an autobiography entitled ''Changing Patterns: An Atypical Autobiography'', which was released in 1968. He became president of the [[Australian Academy of Science]] in 1965. As president he was recognised by both governments and the public as the leading scientist in Australia.<ref name ="Fenner"/> He helped establish the Academy's Science and Industry Forum and the foundations of the [[Australian Biological Resources Study]]. When his presidency ended in 1969, the Academy founded the Burnet Lecture and Medal, which is the Academy's highest award for biological sciences.

Burnet's essays and books published in his later life caused contention within the scientific community and to the chagrin of his peers, Burnet often made pessimistic proclamations about the future of science.<ref>Sexton. 1999. p254-55.</ref><ref name ="Goding"/> In 1966 Burnet wrote an opinion article for the ''[[The Lancet]]'' entitled "Men or Molecules?" in which he questioned the usefulness of [[molecular biology]], arguing that it had not [contributed] and would not contribute anything of use to medicine and that manipulation of the genome as had been demonstarated [demonstrated] in bacteria would do more harm to humans than good.<ref>Burnet, F.M. 1966. Men or molecules? A tilt at molecular biology. ''Lancet'' 1:37-9. PMID 4159163</ref> Gustav Nossal subquently [subsequently] described Burnet as "a biologist with a love-hate affair with biochemistry, which led to a brief but damaging rejection of the worth of molecular biology."<ref name = "Nossal Nature"/>

Burnet spoke and wrote widely on the topic of human biology after his retirement. In the 1966 [In 1966] Burnet presented the [[Boyer Lectures|Boyer Lecture]], focussing on human biology, he [biology. He] provided a conceptual framework for sustainable development; 21 years later the definition provided by the Brundtland Commission was almost identical.<ref>Blutstein, H. 2003. A forgotten pioneer of sustainability. ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 11:339<U+2013>341</ref> In 1970 he revised an earlier book which was published as ''Dominant Mammal: the Biology of Human Destiny''; it was followed by ''Endurance of Life'', which was published in 1978. The books discuss aspects of human biology, a topic which Burnet wrote on extensively in his later years. In ''Dominant Mammal'' he argued that the roots of all human behaviour can be found in the behaviour of animals; in ''Endurance'' he addressed issues of ageing, life, death and the future of mankind. One reviewers [reviewer] described his ideas of sociobiololy as "extreme" and giving "a dissmal [dismal], unappealing view of humanity".<ref>Woodhead, A.D. 1979. Untitled review of Endurance of Life. The Implications of Genetics for Human Life. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology'' 54:121</ref> 

His first wife, Edith Linda Druce, died from lymphoid leukaemia in 1973, and in 1976 he married Hazel G. Jenkins. In 1978 Burnet decided to officially retire; in retirement he wrote two books. In November 1984 he underwent surgery for [[colorectal cancer]]; secondary lesions were found in August 1985, and he died on August 31 at his son's home at [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]]. He was given a state funeral by the government of Australia, and was buried after a private family service at Tower Hill cemetery, near Port Fairy. Following his death he was honoured by the House of Representatives which took the highly unusual step of moving a condolence motion in Parliament, an honour typically reserved for parliamentarians.<ref>[http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/TranslateWIPILink.aspx?Folder=HANSARDR&Criteria=DOC_DATE:1985-09-10%3BSEQ_NUM:5%3B Hansard], September 10, 1985</ref>

==Honours and legacy==
Burnet received extensive honours for his contributions to science and public life during his lifetime. He was the first recipient of the honorary [[Australian of the Year]] award, which was created to reward those Australians who have a consistent record of excellence, who have made outstanding achievements in their fields, and who have contributed in a significant way to the nation. In 1978 he was made a [[Order of Australia|Knight of the Order of Australia]]. The British Empire created him [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1951, and he received the Elizabeth II Coronation Medal in 1953 and the [[Order of Merit]] in 1958. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1969 and received the Elizabeth II Jubilee Medal in 1977. He received a Gold and Silver Star<!--2nd Class, Order of the Rising Sun--> from the Japanese [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1961.

He was a fellow or honorary member of 30 international Academies of Sciences. He received 10 honorary [[Doctor of Science|D.Sc.]] degrees from universities including Cambridge, Harvard and Oxford, an honorary M.D. from Hahnemann Medical College (now part of [[Drexel University]]), an honorary Doctor of Medical Science from the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] and a Doctor of Laws from the University of Melbourne. Including his Nobel, he received 19 medals or awards including the [[Royal Medal]] and the [[Copley Medal]] from the Royal Society and the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]; he also received 33 international lectureships and 17 lectureships within Australia.

Australia's largest communicable diseases research institute&mdash;the [[Burnet Institute]] (founded in 1986) &mdash;was named in his honour. The Burnet Clinical Research Unit of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute was also named in his honour in 1986. In 1975 his work on immunology was recognised by a 33-cent stamp released by [[Australia Post]]. Seven Australian medical scientists were commemorated in the issue of a set of four Australian stamps released in<!--7th September,--> 1995; he appears on the 45-cent stamp with fellow University of Melbourne graduate [[Jean Macnamara]].

Burnet biographer Christopher Sexton suggests that Burnet's legacy is fourfold: (1) the scope and quality of his research; (2) his nationalistic attitude which led him to stay in Australia, leading to the development of science in Australia and inspiring future generations of Australian scientists; (3) his success establishing the reputation of Australian medical research worldwide; and (4) his books, essays and other writings.<ref>Sexton 1999, pp. 251<U+2013>54.</ref> In spite if his sometimes controversial ideas on science and humanity, [[Peter Doherty]] has noted that "Burnet's reputation is secure in his achievements as an experimentalist, a theoretician and a leader of the Australian scientific community."<ref name = "Doherty"/>
