''' Stotts Island Nature Reserve''' is a protected area of 141 hectares, situated on the [[Australia]]n east coast near [[Tweed Heads, New South Wales|Tweed Heads]]. Established on 25 June 1971, it lies 12 km northeast of [[Murwillumbah]] in the Tweed River.<ref name="millar01">{{cite book|last=Millar|first=Julia|title=Stotts Island Nature Reserve Plan of Management|publisher=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|date=March 2001|isbn=0-7313-6977-7|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/parks/pomFinalStotts.pdf}}</ref>

Stotts Island is composed of [[alluvium]] deposited from the Pleistocene to the present. It is prone to flooding, during which times silt and weed material accumulate on the island. The island is continuously being reshaped by erosion.<ref name="millar01"/>

The reserve contains an intact 77 hectare segment of lowland sub-tropical [[rainforest]]. Most of this rainforest type has been destroyed for agriculture, mining or housing. The [[critically endangered]] [[Mitchell's rainforest snail]] is known to occur here.<ref name="millar01"/> The rainforest is particularly tall and impressive. Species of rainforest tree include [[Hoop Pine]], [[Bangalow Palm]], [[Tuckeroo]], [[Syzygium francisii|Francis Water Gum]], [[Elaeocarpus obovatus|Hard Quandong]], [[Cassia marksiana|Cigar Cassia]] and [[Ficus virens var. sublanceolata |White Fig]].<ref>[[Floyd, A.G.]], Australian Rainforests in New South Wales Volume 2 - 1990 ISBN 0-949324-32-9 page 21-22</ref> The [[endangered]] [[Red-fruited Ebony]] has been planted in the adjacent Bruce Chick Conservation Park, and may no longer be found on the island.<ref> Luis Weber (rainforest botanist)</ref> Bruce Chick was a local resident who encouraged re-vegetation of the riverside rainforest.<ref name="millar01"/>

Weeds that have invaded nearby rainforest include madeira vine (''[[Anredera cordifolia]]''), cat's claw (''[[Macfadyena unguis-cati]]''), moonflower (''[[lpomoea alba]]'') and lantana (''[[Lantana camara]]''), although the rainforest on the island itself has been little affected to date.<ref name="millar01"/>

47 species of bird, 6 species of lizard, 3 species of snakes and 3 species of frogs have been recorded on Stotts Island Nature Reserve. Mammal species and populations are poorly known.<ref name="millar01"/>
