In the [[Odyssey]] it is described as the rocky stronghold of [[Lamos of the Laestrygonians|Lamos]]. Its location has been identified with [[Mesapo]] in [[Greece]]. When Odysseus reached the city in the [[Odyssey]], a tall girl leads him and his crew to her father, a giant cannibal. He then eats a man. Odysseus and the crew tried to run away, but most of the men were killed from the [[Laestrygonians]]' giant weapons. Only fifty-two men escaped.
