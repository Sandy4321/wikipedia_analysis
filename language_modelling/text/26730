The '''history of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]''' spans from its origins as regulatory body to its expansion as a content provider in [[radio]], [[television]] and [[new media]].

==Origins==
[[Image:ABC Perth.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ABC building in Perth, 1937]]

The first radio station in Australia, 2SB in [[Sydney]], opened on November 13th, [[1923]]. It was opened by Sydney Broadcasting Limited, a subsidiary of [[Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited]] (AWA). The station callsign was changed to 2BL several months later to avoid confusion with another station, 2FC. Stations 3AR in [[Melbourne]] and 6WF in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] opened soon after. The stations sold 'sealed set' radios (tuning fixed to the station's frequency) which was not popular with listeners.

In [[1924]] the licencing system was changed. The [[Postmaster-General's Department]] collected all licence fees and broadcasters were funded as either A-Class or B-Class stations. A-Class stations received government funding and take limited advertising. B-Class stations received no government funding but could take more advertising. By [[1925]] many of the A-Class stations were in financial difficulty. 

A [[1927]] [[Royal Commission]] into wireless broadcasting recommended that radio licence fees be pooled to fund larger A-Class stations. The government established the National Broadcasting Service to take over the 12 A-Class licences as they came up for renewal. In [[1928]] the federal government started buying up the A-class stations and merged them into the National Broadcasting Service. The original legislation permitted advertising, but this was removed from the Act before it came into effect. The government also created the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] to supply programs to the national broadcaster.

Initially the [[Postmaster-General's Department]], which operated postal and telephone services, had responsibilty for operating the National Broadcasting Service. This arrangement did not have universal political support so the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established on July 1st, [[1932]] to take over the Australian Broadcasting Company and run the National Broadcasting Service. The ABC was based on the [[BBC]] model, funded partly by direct government grants and drew most of its revenue from listener licence fees. 

The opening-day program included the first <U+2018>Children's Session<U+2019> with <U+2018>Bobby Bluegum<U+2019>; the first sports program, <U+2018>Racing Notes<U+2019>, with WA Ferry calling the Randwick races; <U+2018>British Wireless News<U+2019>, received by cable from London; weather; stock exchange and shipping news; the ABC Women's Association session (on <U+2018>commonsense housekeeping<U+2019> and needlecraft); a talk on goldfish and their care; <U+2018>Morning Devotions<U+2019>; and music. In 1934, famed conductor [[Bernard Heinze|Sir Bernard Heinze]] was appointed part-time musical adviser to the ABC. In 1937, the network was expanded with the purchase of Brisbane<U+2019>s 4BC, and two years later began publishing the ''ABC Weekly''.

Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy. The Australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the ABC and the commercial sector. This new system became the structural foundation for the industry and remained unchanged for the next forty years, later forming a basis for the television industry in the 1950s. 

During the broadcaster's first decades, programs generally consisted of music, news and current affairs, sport, drama, children's educational supplements and school broadcasts. Because recording technology was still relatively primitive, all ABC programs were broadcast live until 1935, including music. For this purpose, the ABC established broadcasting orchestras in each state, and in some centres employed choruses and dance bands (see: [[#Orchestras]]).

==World War II==
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the ABC continued to recruit staff, including a greater proportion of women to replace men who had joined the armed forces. The organisation established reporting and recording facilities in numerous overseas locations, including the Middle East, Greece and the Asia-Pacific region. An early challenge to its independence came in June 1940 when wartime censorship was imposed, and the Department of Information (headed by Sir [[Keith Murdoch]]) took control of the ABC<U+2019>s 7 p.m. nightly national news. This lasted only until September, when control of the news was returned to the ABC after listeners expressed a preference for independent news presented by the Commission.

During the war, the ABC's [[news program|news bulletins]] attained a reputation for authority and independence, and from 1942 onwards, were broadcast three times daily through all national and most commercial [[transmitters]]. The ABC's ability to speak to all Australians across a huge, sparsely populated country was now recognised as an essential part of the nation's infrastructure. During and after the war, the ABC was given statutory powers that reinforced its independence from the government and enhanced its news-gathering role. From 1946, the ABC was required to broadcast selected parliamentary sessions live, despite the disruption this caused to regular programming.

On [[7 January]] [[1941]] the ABC revived the Children's Session as a national program, including the "Argonauts Club", which was first broadcast in 1933-34 in Melbourne. The Argonauts Club proved hugely popular with young Australians - by 1950 there were over 50,000 members, with 10,000 new members joining each year in the 1950s. The Club encouraged children's contributions of writing, music, poetry and art, and became one of the ABC's most popular programs, running six days a week for 28 years. 

''The Argonauts Club'' was co-hosted for its entire 31-year run by [[Atholl Fleming]], known to generations of Australians by his on-air names "Mac" and "Jason". Many notable Australians worked pseudonymously as presenters on the show, including poet [[A.D. Hope]] ("Antony Inkwell"), future ABC General Manager [[Talbot Duckmanton]] ("Tal") who hosted a weekly sports segment, actors [[Leonard Teale]] ("Chris") and [[John Ewart]] ("Jimmy") and future "Mr Sqiggle" host and film producer [[Patricia Lovell]]. Painter [[Jeffrey Smart]] ("Phidias") commented on art, and popular children's author [[Ruth Park]] contributed dramatised stories. Her main character, which began life as a bunyip, eventually evolved into her beloved "[[Muddle Headed Wombat]]" character, voiced inimitably by Johnny Ewart. Its popularity on The Argonauts led Park to write her popular series of Muddle Headed Wombat books in the 1960s.

In 1942 ''The Australian Broadcasting Act'' was passed, giving the ABC the power to decide when, and in what circumstances, political speeches should be broadcast. Directions from the Minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing, and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the Commission's Annual Report. It was used only once, in 1963.

Also in 1942, "Kindergarten of the Air" began on ABC Radio in Perth; it was later broadcast nationally and became one of the ABC<U+2019>s most popular programs.

==Post-war years==

In December 1945, just after the end of the war, the rural affairs program "The Country Hour" premiered. In 1946, legislation was passed requiring the ABC to broadcast Parliament when in session. The parliamentary broadcasts were put onto the interstate network. In subsequent Annual Reports, the Commission commented on the disruption this caused to its programming. Another landmark came on [[June 1]], [[1947]], when the ABC's independent national news service was inaugurated.

During the 1950s, the variety and quantity of programming increased significantly, including light entertainment, sports coverage, talk programs, and features <U+2014> early forms of what became known as [[radio documentary|documentaries]]. The ABC's coverage of rural affairs was significantly enhanced by the deployment of journalists and broadcasters in major country areas. The increasing availability of [[landline]]s and [[teleprinter]]s allowed the organisation to gather and broadcast news and other program material with much greater efficiency than in the previous two decades. By the 1950s, as many as 13 national news bulletins were broadcast daily. By 1956, the Commission had begun to establish an international presence with offices opening in [[London]], [[New York]] and [[Port Moresby]].

In 1953, the federal ''Television Act'' was passed, providing the initial regulatory framework for both the ABC and commercial television networks. In late 1956, the ABC started regular [[television]] broadcasts from Sydney and Melbourne, just in time to cover the Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne. On November 5, the ABC made its first TV broadcast from its Sydney studios, inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], and on November 19 the first TV broadcast beamed out from the ABC's Melbourne's studios.

Within a year, ABC-TV was broadcasting from each of the six state capitals. In its first decade, the network developed a wide range of programming that included [[ABC News|news bulletins]], light entertainment, children's and educational programs, and the performing arts.

==The 1960s and 70s: growing social and intellectual influence==
The authority and influence of the ABC have been most strongly felt in news and current affairs, in which the organisation's innovations have set the standard for Australian broadcasting. In 1961, ABC-TV started a weekly current affairs program ''[[Four Corners (TV series)|Four Corners]]'', which was characterised by a new, vigorous investigative reporting style of political and social issues that were occasionally ahead of public opinion.

The ABC was one of the first TV networks to embrace the rock'n'roll revolution of the late 1950s, most notably with its pioneering show ''[[Six O'Clock Rock]]'', hosted by [[Johnny O'Keefe]]. During the 60s and early 70s the ABC continued to produce programs on popular music, including the pop show ''Hitscene'', innovative performance specials by groups such as [[Tully (band)|Tully]] and [[Max Merritt & The Meteors]], and the landmark magazine-style program ''[[GTK (TV show)|GTK]]'', which premiered in 1969 and screened for 10 minutes, four nights per week, Monday to Thursday, at 6.30pm, immediately prior to [[Bellbird (TV series)|Bellbird ]] and the 7pm news bulletin. 

As well as news, special reports, film clips and interview segments, ''GTK'' was especially notable - and of great historical value - for the inclusion of a nightly segment of specially recorded live in-studio performances by Australian bands. Each week a different band was featured, which would record four songs; in the case of more popular bands, the producers chose tracks other than their hits to demonstrate different aspects of their music. Although it was long thought that most of this priceless material had been erased - like the BBC, an ill-advised "economy drive" in the late 1970s led to the wholesale erasure of large amounts of videotaped material, including most of the first two years of ''[[Countdown (TV show)|Countdown]]''. However, extensive archival research within the ABC following the recent closure of the old [[Gore Hill]] studios in Sydney has revealed that, although some early videotape-only content was erased, much of the primary footage had (fortunately) been shot on film and most of this was retained. It is believed that approximately 80% of ''GTK'' has survived.

By the mid-1960s, [[videotape]] equipment had been installed in all major ABC centres, and during that decade, direct television relays were laid, first from Melbourne to Sydney, and Sydney to Canberra, then between all major centres except for Perth and Hobart. By 1972, all state capitals were linked, allowing simultaneous viewing and national programming. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia.

In 1967, the weeknight television current affairs program, ''[[This Day Tonight]]'' (TDT), and its counterpart on radio, ''PM'', were introduced. Many people regard these programs, and others like them, to be essential parts of Australian public life, in which politicians and other public figures and organisations were subject to rigorous, though balanced, interviewing and reportage. The ABC also focused on producing radio and television talk programs that explored a wide range of national and international issues. Prominent among these was ''[http://abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/default.htm The Science Show]'', which started in 1975 on ABC Radio, hosted by [[Robyn Williams]]. Beginning in the same year was also the prominent radio program, ''Coming out ready or not'' (later known simply as ''The Coming Out Show''), dealing with women's issues. In 1975, colour television was introduced in Australia, and within a decade, the ABC had moved into [[satellite]] broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to serve as a national broadcaster.

In 1975, the ABC introduced a 24 hour-a-day AM [[rock (music)|rock]] station in Sydney, 2JJ ([[Double Jay]]), which was eventually expanded into the national [[Triple J]] FM network. A year later, a national [[European classical music|classical music]] network was established on the [[frequency modulation|FM]] band, broadcasting from Adelaide. [[Radio Australia]] continued to thrive as a voice of authority in the Asia-Pacific region.

===<U+2018>Wavelength<U+2019> logo===
[[Image:AustralianBroadcastingCorporation1990s.JPG|frame|right|The ABC Radio Wavelength Logo, Circa Late [[1980s]].]]
The ABC <U+2018>wavelength<U+2019> logo is one of the most recognisable logos in [[Australia]]. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using [[Lissajous]] figures as fillers in-between programs. In July [[1963]], the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. In [[1965]], ABC graphics designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was presented with twenty five pounds for his design.

==The late 20th century to the present==
[[Image:ABC Sydney.jpg|thumb|right|ABC Building Sydney]]
In 1983, the name of the organisation was changed from 'Commission' to 'Corporation' with the passing of a new ''ABC Act'' by [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]].

During the 1980s, the ABC underwent significant restructuring. Program production in indigenous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded. There was considerable pressure on the organisation to increase its production of Australian drama, which trebled from 1986&ndash;91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements. Since this time, ABC dramas have explored numerous themes related to the unique aspects of Australian living; these themes have not been covered by commercial and foreign producers to the same extent, and thus the ABC has played an important role in the evolution of Australia's national identity.

The ABC continued to be active in Australia's music world, chiefly through its six state-based symphony orchestras. The organisation managed an active concert schedule - both orchestral concerts and recitals - in the six state capitals, and coordinated the deployment of the world's prominent soloists in these schedules. However, during the 1980s, there was increasing pressure for the orchestras to be divested; this occurred in ?1990 with the formation of [[Symphony Australia]], an umbrella organisation that coordinates the now independent state-based orchestras.

In the 1980s, the ABC set in motion plans to consolidate its disorganised arrangement of property and buildings in Sydney and Melbourne into single sites in each city. In Sydney, the radio and orchestral operations moved to a single site in Sydney's inner-city suburb of [[Ultimo]] in 1991, joined by ABC-TV operations in ?2002. In Melbourne, the ABC Southbank Centre was finished in 1994, and now houses the radio division in Victoria and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. The 1990s saw the expansion of the ABC's network of ABC shops, which sell a wide range of program-related merchandise, including books, [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s. During the same decade, ''ABC online'' was established as a valuable adjunct to the organisation's broadcasting endeavours. It is now possible for anyone in the world to access a large amount of information, including transcripts and audio and video streams of many programs, on the internet. By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24 hour-a-day operation, and regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in ?1995, and [[ABC NewsRadio]], a continuous news network when parliament is not sitting, was launched on [[October 5]], [[1996]]. Australia Television International was established as an authoritative, popular, non-commercial resource in east Asia, and Radio Australia increased its international reach. In 1995, D-Cart digital technology developed by ABC Radio, excited worldwide interest and was sold to European, North American and Asian markets. The ABC used D-Radio, the first fully digital audio system for the first time, broadcasting on Triple J. In the first decade of the new century, the ABC has continued its process of computerising and [[digital|digitising]] production, post-production and transmission. In 2005, [[ABC2]], a digital television channel, was launched.
