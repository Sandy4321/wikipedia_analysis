{{Politics of Sri Lanka}}
The '''State Council of Ceylon''' was the [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[legislature]] for [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), established in 1931 by the [[Donoughmore Constitution]]. The State Council gave [[Universal suffrage|universal adult franchise]] to the people of the colony for the first time. It replaced the [[Legislative Council of Ceylon]], the colony's original legislative body.

There were only two State Councils: the First, elected in [[Ceylonese State Council election, 1931|1931]], and the Second, elected in [[Ceylonese State Council election, 1936|1936]].  The 1947 [[Soulbury Constitution]] replaced the State Council with the [[Parliament of Ceylon]], as part of a process of constitutional development leading up to independence, which took place on 4 February 1948.

==History==
Due to Ceylonese demands for constitutional reform, a [[royal commission]] was established by the British authorities under the chairmanship of the [[Earl of Donoughmore]]. The Donoughmore Commission arrived in the colony in 1927, before returning to the United Kingdom where it issued its report. The Commission proposed reforms which were implemented as the so-called [[Donoughmore Constitution]], resulting in the abolution of the [[Legislative Council of Ceylon]] as the colony's legislature, and its replacement by a "State Council" in 1931.

The structure and working of the State Council was experimental, and was based in part on the United Kingdom's [[London County Council]]. The State Council functioned in both an executive and legislative capacity, with seven committees performing executive duties. Each committee consisted of designated members of the State Council, and was chaired by an elected Ceylonese who was addressed as minister. The Ceylonese ministers formed a board of ministers with three British officials of ministerial rank who handled defence, external affairs, finance, and judicial matters.

The Donoughmore Constitution was not considered a great success, and this combined with Ceylonese demands for further constitutional reform led to a new commission being established, under the chairmanship of [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Lord Soulbury]], which arrived in Ceylon in 1944. Based on the report by the [[Soulbury Commission]], a new constitution was created, by which the State Council was replaced by a [[Parliament of Ceylon|Parliament]], elections for which were conducted in 1947.  Negotiations with Ceylon's newly elected government resulted in the British granting Ceylon independence as a [[dominion]] in 1948.

==Membership==
The State Council consisted of 58 members, of whom 50 would be elected by universal suffrage, with the remaining 8 members appointed by the [[British governors of Ceylon|Governor]].
