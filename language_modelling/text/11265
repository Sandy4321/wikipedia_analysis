== Biography ==

'''Remo Bianchi''' (known as '''Remo Bianco''') was born in [[Milan]] on {{nowrap|June 3, 1922}}. His father, Guido, was an electrician at the theatre [[La Scala]], a confirmed anarchist and an austere man.  His mother, Giovanna Ripamonti, had studied astrology.  Remo was the second of two twins, the brother Romolo died of pneumonia in 1923.  He had a strong bond with his siter Lydia, who was born before the twins and became a star of the ballet.

In 1937 he enrolled at evening courses at the [[Brera Academy]], where he met [[Filippo de Pisis|de Pisis]] two years later and began to  attend the Master<U+2019>s studio regularly; there he had the opportunity to meet other artists such as [[Carlo Carr<U+00E0>|Carr<U+00E0>]], [[Mario Sironi|Sironi]], [[Alberto Savinio|Savinio]], [[Ardengo Soffici|Soffici]], Soldati, [[Marino Marini|Marini]], Cantatore.

In 1941 he was enrolled as a machine-gunner on a destroyer, which was torpedoed and sunk two years later.  Bianco, rescued by the British, was interned in Tunisia where he experienced his first contact with the middle east.<ref>{{Citation | author=C. Strinati (see Bibliography)}}</ref>

=== The Early Works: The Figurative Season===

In 1944 he returned to Milan where he resumed his contacts with Filippo de Pisis and his studies at the Brera Academy.
In this period his works are strongly similar to the existential [[expressionism]] of the French [[Georges Rouault|Rouault]], notably the self portrait which he painted in 1945.  In his paintings large and dark lines begin to enclose thick layers of leaden and sulphurous colour. From the fifties, Bianco<U+2019>s portraits become increasingly speckled and the brushstrokes more disorderly, while the colours are reduced in thickness.

=== From Figurative Art to Abstraction:  The Nuclear and Spatial Season ===
From the [[Nuclear art|Nuclear Movement]] (founded in Milan in 1951 by D'Angelo e [[Enrico Baj|Baj]]), Bianco gained a love of materials.  In his works, the features of the faces become increasingly imperceptible, giving way to paint blends. <!-- commenting out - incomprehensible, please clarify! ... for scales of materials which by now are almost completely shapeless (Testa, 1952).-->  His next progression was more radical, a composition of pigments, glass crystals, paint, glue, iridescent paste, and pebbles.<ref>(Nuclear, 1952)</ref>  On the contrary, from [[Spatialism]]  he captured the more creative, experimental, ironic and Dadaist dimension, taking interest in the materialistic trace and chromatic writing.  The paintings are almost completely free of figures and become a layer of threads and paint strokes.

=== The Three Dimensional Artworks: ''3D'' ===
At the beginning of the fifties, Bianco began to change his geometric works on layers of glass and plastic, taking advantage of their milky or translucent transparency  to create delicate, hazy and transparent effects. In addition to these three-dimensional works he created others in wood, Plexiglas and metal, always in layers but carved in various forms. On receiving a scholarship in 1955 he travelled to the United States where he had the opportunity of meeting [[Jackson Pollock]].

=== From ''Collages'' to ''Tableaux dor<U+00E9>s'' to ''Appropriazioni'' ({{lang-en|Appropriations}}) ===
In the United States Bianco learned the technique of [[drip painting]], but he did not lose his love for proportions and order, giving life to his Collages.  Papers (or fabrics), again painted with signs and drippings, are cut in small squares, mixed together and recomposed as a [[collage]] or a [[mosaic]], arranging them like a chessboard.
And it is from the development of Collages that Bianco came to create his most well known artworks:  the Tableaux dor<U+00E9>s.  This category is not only his most numerous but also his richest in creativity; each one being unique for the colours and the amount and extent of gold leaf used. Even where small amounts of gold leaf are used the artwork does not lose its power and eloquence, but gains  in mystery and profundity.<ref>{{Citation | author=C. Strinati (see Bibliography) | author2=L. Giudici | title=Una lunga ricerca tra alchimia e sogno, tra favola e realt<U+00E0>.}}</ref>

Bianco continued to paint Tableaux dor<U+00E9>s until the eighties; during this time these artworks began the evolution of his experiments:  the Appropriations of the seventies.  In these works gold leaf is applied to everyday objects of varying sizes. <!-- following phrase incomprehensible - please fix! ... like a car of which he takes possession with the trademark of his Tableaux.-->

=== ''Arte Improntale'' ({{lang-en|Imprint Art}}), the ''Testimonianze'' ({{lang-en|Testimonies}}), the ''Sculture Neve'' ({{lang-en|Snow Sculptures}}) ===
Bianco developed the ''Arte Improntale'' back in 1948 by dipping objects in paint and stamping the imprint.  In the mid fifties he began to create rubber and paper casts of objects, and wrote the <U+201C>''Manifesto dell'Arte Improntale''<U+201D> (1956).  His ''Testimonianze''({{lang-en|testimony-bags}}) are an example of ''Arte Improntale''; these are rows of small cellophane sachets, aligned as in the Tableaux dor<U+00E9>s, and filled with small worn out objects, fragments of everyday life.

In the mid seventies he experimented with a new material, artificial snow, which he sprayed on the most diverse objects {{endash}} and even on people.  Small objects were enclosed in showcases, and people were photographed in black and white.  The ''Sculture Neve'' are the direct descendants of ''Testimonianze''.

=== '' Arte Elementare'' ({{lang-en|Elementary Art}}) ===
This was one of the last experimental periods by Bianco. In the seventies, while continuing work on his other series, he returned to the fundamentals of painting by producing on backgrounds {{endash}}often filled with squares {{endash}} rows of small trains, flowers, fruits, carousels, tin soldiers and long-hand writing, all of which return to a world of minimal and stereotyped representations.
