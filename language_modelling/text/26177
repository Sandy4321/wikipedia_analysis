==History==
F. D. Roosevelt was founded in 1946 by American residents in Peru. It is a non-sectarian, non-profit, private day school supported by tuition and fees. The program is co-educational, non-residential and extends from early childhood (age 3) through twelfth grade.  The school is governed by a 12-member Board of Directors representing the Instituto Educacional Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The American School of Lima is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and the Peruvian Ministry of Education.

==Enrollment==
Total Pre-K - 12 enrollment is 1239 students including United States citizens (24%), Peruvian citizens (54%), and nationals representing 42 other countries (22%).

==School facilities==
The Elementary, Middle School and High School programs are housed in facilities distributed throughout the campus. The Dr. Anne S. Johnson Media Center, known as the Media Center, constructed in 1984 has over 40,000 volumes and a wide range of audio-visual resources. The school has more than 500 computers installed in 3 labs, many classrooms, and most offices. Most are networked and Internet accessible. Well-equipped science labs and 2 large gymnasiums also support the instructional and extracurricular programs.

==Academics==
The educational program is that of a United States college preparatory school. The primary language of instruction is English with a small number of elective courses taught in Spanish.

The Pre-K through grade 5 Elementary School is organized in heterogeneous classroom units. The grade 6 through grade 8 Middle School has adopted a typical US Middle School philosophy based on a recognition of developmental needs and preparation for a demanding high school college preparatory program.

Emphasis in the High School (grades 9-12) is on preparation for entrance into colleges or universities in the US, Peru, or other countries. The curriculum is designed to meet both United States and Peruvian standards. All students follow the U.S. program of studies. Those Peruvian or international students who also wish to obtain a Peruvian certificate will take some additional courses in order to meet the Peruvian Ministry of Education's requirements.
