'''SMS ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n''''' was a {{sclass|Tegetthoff|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought]], the only one built in the Hungarian part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The [[Ganz]] & Company's Danubius yard in Hungarian-owned [[Fiume]] (Rijeka) was awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets. She was named after Hungary's first Christian king, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]] ({{lang-hu|Szent Istv<U+00E1>n}}). She, and her classmates, were regarded as very compact and powerful ships and were the first dreadnoughts in service with triple main-gun turrets.<ref name=c24>Gardiner and Gray, p. 334</ref>

Her completion was delayed by the start of [[World War I]], but she was commissioned in December 1915. She spent the bulk of the war at anchor in [[Pula|Pola]], leaving harbour generally only for gunnery training. Her final mission began on the evening of 9 June 1918 when she sailed to rendezvous with the other dreadnoughts for an attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]], scheduled for the following day. Two Italian [[motor torpedo boat]]s discovered ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' and her half-sister {{SMS|Tegetthoff||2}} early in the morning of 10 June 1918 while returning after an night patrol off the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. They penetrated past her escorts and torpedoed her twice abreast her boiler rooms. They flooded, which knocked out power to the pumps, and ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] less than three hours after being torpedoed. However, all but 89 of her crew were rescued.

Her wreck was discovered in the mid-1970s, upside down, off the Croatian island of [[Premuda]]. She has been declared a protected site by the [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Croatian Ministry of Culture]] and casual diving is forbidden.

==Design==
''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' differed from her half-[[sister ship|sisters]] mainly in her machinery. She only had two shafts and two turbines, unlike the four shaft arrangement of the other ships of her class. External differences included a platform built around the fore funnel which extended from the bridge to the after funnel and on which several searchlights were installed. A further distinguishing feature was the modified ventilator trunk in front of the mainmast. She was the only ship of her class not to be fitted with [[torpedo nets]].<ref>Sieche, p. 132</ref>
 
===General characteristics===
[[Image:SMS Saint Stephen.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Elevation and deck plan|alt=]]
''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|152.18|m|ftin}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|28|m|ftin}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|8.6|m|ftin}} at deep load. She displaced {{convert|20008|t|LT|0}} at load and {{convert|21689|t|LT}} at deep load.<ref name=s3>Sieche, p. 133</ref> The [[skeg]] for each propeller shaft was a solid, blade-like fitting, unlike the strut-type skegs used in her half-sisters, that had such a high transversal resistance that the rudder could only be laid at a maximum angle of 10<U+00B0> at full speed to avoid a heavy [[list (watercraft)|list]].<ref>Sieche, p. 137</ref> The hull was built with a double bottom {{convert|1.22|m|ftin|0}} deep with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of {{convert|25|mm|adj=on|0}} plates.<ref name=s3/>

''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' had two AEG-Curtis [[steam turbine]]s, each of which was housed in a separate engine-room. The turbines were powered by twelve  [[Babcock and Wilcox|Babcock & Wilcox]] in two boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|26000|shp|lk=in|0}}, enough for her designed speed of {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h}}, but no figures from her trials are known to exist.<ref>Sieche, pp. 133, 140</ref> She carried {{convert|1844.5|t|LT}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|267.2|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]] that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate.<ref name=s3/> At full capacity, she could steam for {{convert|4200|nmi|km}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=c24/>

''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' mounted twelve {{convert|305|mm|0|adj=on}}/45-[[caliber (artillery)|caliber]] K 10 guns in four triple turrets. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve {{convert|15|cm|sing=on|sigfig=3}}/50 K 10 guns mounted in [[casemate]]s amidships. Twelve {{convert|66|mm|in|0|adj=on}}/50 K 10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on the upper deck, above the casemates. Three more 66-mm K 10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] duties. Four {{convert|21|in|adj=on}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were fitted, one each in the bow, stern and on each [[broadside]]; twelve torpedoes were carried.<ref name=s3/>

The waterline [[Belt armor|armour belt]] of the ''Tegetthof''-class dreadnoughts measured {{convert|280|mm|0}} thick between the midpoints of the fore and aft barbettes and thinned to 150&nbsp;millimetres further towards the bow and stern, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. It was continued to the bow by a small patch of {{convert|110|-|130|mm|0|adj=on}} armour. The upper armour belt had a maximum thickness of {{convert|180|mm|0}}, but it thinned to 110&nbsp;millimeters from the forward barbette all the way to the bow. The casemate armour was also 180&nbsp;millimetres thick. The sides of the main gun turrets, barbettes and main conning tower were protected by {{convert|280|mm|0}} of armour, except for the turret and conning tower roofs which were {{convert|60|to|150|mm|0}} thick. The thickness of the decks ranged from {{convert|30|to|48|mm|0}} in two layers. The underwater protection system consisted of the extension of the double bottom up to the lower edge of the waterline armour belt, with a thin {{convert|10|mm|1|adj=on}} plate acting as the outermost bulkhead. It was backed by a [[torpedo bulkhead]] that consisted of two layered 25-millimetre plates.<ref>Sieche, pp. 132<U+2013>33</ref> The total thickness of this system was only {{convert|1.6|m|ftin|0}} which made it incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or [[Naval mine|mine]] explosion without rupturing.<ref name="Sieche, p. 135">Sieche, p. 135</ref>

== Construction ==
[[Image:SzentIstvan Danubius.jpg|thumb|left|The launching of ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'']]
''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was laid down on 29 January 1912 at Ganz & Company's Danubius yard at Fiume (Rijeka), (the only large Hungarian shipyard in [[Croatia]]) as {{lang-hu|[[J<U+00E1>nos Hunyadi]]}}, commemorating the Hungarian national hero. Ganz & Company was awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets. This involved great expense by the Hungarian government, as the yard had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for, amongst others, [[Austrian Lloyd]], and therefore had to be itself refitted for the building of larger vessels. However she was renamed ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' by order of the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] before she was launched on 17 January 1914. It was customary for either the [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, but Franz Joseph was too feeble and his heir, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], refused to be there as a consequence of his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph sent a telegram of congratulations that negated the snub offered by his heir.<ref>Sieche, p. 116</ref> During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the arm of the other.<ref>Sieche, pp. 116, 120</ref> Her fitting out was delayed by the start of the war, but she was finally commissioned on 13 December 1915.<ref name=s3/>

==Service==
[[Image:SMS Szent Istvan.png|thumb|right|The forward [[Superfire|superfiring]] main gun turrets|alt=]]
''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was based at Pola for the duration of her career. In fact she rarely left port except for gunnery practice in the nearby [[Fa<U+017E>ana]] Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to [[Pag (island)|Pag Island]]. Only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; for the rest of the time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. She was never even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned.<ref>Sieche, p. 123</ref> 

Her tenure in Pola was livened up by a visit from the new Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] on 15 December 1916 and another by [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhem II]] on 12 December 1917 during his inspection of the German submarine base there. The Italians conducted no less than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the crews of her anti-aircraft gun busy.<ref>Sieche, pp. 120, 122<U+2013>23</ref>

===Sinking===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C2280, Szent Istv<U+00E1>n, Sinkendes Linienschiff.jpg|thumb|left|''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' low in the water]]
At about 11:00 PM on 9 June 1918 ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' and ''Tegetthoff'', escorted by one [[destroyer]] and six [[torpedo boat]]s, departed Pola, after some troubles getting the harbour defense barrage opened. They were enroute to the harbour at [[Slano]], north of [[Dubrovnik]] (Ragusa) to rendezvous with the two other dreadnoughts, {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} and {{SMS|Prinz Eugen}}, for a coordinated attack on the [[Otranto Barrage]]. At about 0315 on the morning of 10 June two [[Regia Marina|Italian]] [[MAS (boat)|MAS boats]], ''MAS 15'' and ''MAS 21'', spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. The MAS platoon was commanded by [[Frigate Captain|''Capitano di fregata'']] [[Luigi Rizzo]] while the individual boats were commanded by ''Capo timoniere'' Armando Gori and [[Ensign (rank)|''Guardiamarina di complemento'']] Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. ''MAS 21'' attacked ''Tegetthof'', but her torpedoes failed. MAS 15 fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25 AM at ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n''. Both boats evaded any pursuit although ''MAS 15'' had to discourage the torpedo boat {{ship|Austrian torpedo boat|Tb 76||2}} by dropping [[depth charge]]s in her wake. ''Tegetthof'' thought that the torpedoes were fired by [[submarine]]s and pulled out of the formation and started to [[zigzag]] to throw off any further attacks. She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine [[periscope]]s until she rejoined her half-sister at 4:45.<ref name=s7>Sieche, pp. 127, 131</ref>

[[Image:Affondamento Santo Stefano.jpg|thumb|right|The last moments of ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'']]
''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was hit by two {{convert|45|cm|adj=on|0}} torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10<U+00B0> list to starboard. Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s reduced the list to 7<U+00B0>, but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed. While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby [[Molat (island)|Bay of Brgulje]] at low speed. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a pointless effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. Flooding continued, however, and ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' [[Capsizing|capsized]] at 6:05 AM off [[Premuda]] Island. Only 89 sailors died, the low death toll partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|KuK]] Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service.<ref name=s7/>

Film footage exists of ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n''{{'}}s last half-hour, taken by [[Captain Lieutenant|''Linienschiffsleutnant'']] Meusburger of the ''Tegetthoff'' with his own camera as well as by an official film crew. The two films were later spliced together and exhibited in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]]. The ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' is one of only two battleships whose sinking was filmed, together with {{HMS|Barham|1914|6}}.<ref name=s31/>

The wreck of the ''Szent Istv<U+00E1>n'' was located in the mid-1970s by the [[SFR Yugoslav Navy]]. She is upside down at a depth of {{convert|66|m|0}}.<ref>Sieche, pp. 138, 142</ref> Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is it immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull. The two holes from the torpedo hits are visible in the side of the ship as is another deep hole which may be from a torpedo fired at ''Tegetthof'' by ''MAS 21''. She is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and diving is forbidden without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondmag.co.uk/wreck/svent.htm|title=Svent Istvan - Diving into History|last=Ruberti |first=Fabio |publisher=Beyond the Blue|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>

==Consequences==
[[Konteradmiral]] [[Mikl<U+00F3>s Horthy]], commander of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack because he thought that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.<ref name=s31>Sieche, p. 131</ref>

On the contrary the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there.<ref name="Sieche, p. 135"/> ''Capitano di fregata'' Luigi Rizzo was awarded his second [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]], his first was for sinking the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Wien||2}} in 1917, and appointed a knight in the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]]. After the war ''MAS 15'' was installed in the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II]] as part of the Museo di Risorgismento in [[Rome]]. The anniversary of the sinking has been celebrated by the [[Regia Marina]], and its successor, the [[Marina Militare]], as its [[Navy Day]] ({{lang-it|Festa della Marina}}).<ref name=s31/>
