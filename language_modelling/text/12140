The '''Second Leiter Building''', also known as '''Lieter II Building''' and the '''[[Sears]] Building''', is located at the norteast corner of South State Street and East Congress Street in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. (not to be confused with [[Sears Tower]]). This [[landmark]] of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago school of architecture]] has gained its fame for being one of the first commercial buildings still standing in the United States to have metal [[skeleton frame]].

Built in [[1891]] by [[Levi Leiter]] the Second Leiter Building was designed by [[architect]] [[William LeBaron Jenney]] who implemented the skeletal frame made of [[cast iron]] to make the design fireproof. The building was leased by [[Sears|Sears, Roebuck & Co]]. to become its flagship [[department store]] and still stands to this day. Its predecessor the [[First Leiter Building]] was built at Wells and Monroe in [[1879]] but unlike its successor the building was demolished in [[1972]]. The Second Leiter Building was designated a landmark on [[January 14]], [[1997]].
