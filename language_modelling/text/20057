'''Alexis John Augustine Bachelot''' (February 22, 1796&nbsp;<U+2013> December 5, 1837) was a [[Roman Catholic priest]] best known for his tenure as the first [[Prefecture Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands|Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands]]. In that role, he led the first Catholic [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]] to the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Bachelot was raised in France, where he attended the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was ordained a priest in 1820. After the [[Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary]], to which he belonged, was given the responsibility of evangelizing Hawaii, he left France in 1825 to lead the mission. The Hawaiian Islands had already been reached by American Protestant missionaries who converted Hawaiian leaders, most of whom were hostile to the presence of missionaries from a competing denomination. Bachelot, however, was able to quietly minister to a small group of Hawaiian Catholics for four years. He learned the [[Hawaiian language]] and introduced two new plant species to the island before being deported in 1831 on the orders of the [[Queen Regent]] of Hawaii, [[Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu]].

After being forced to leave, Bachelot traveled to California and landed in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles]]. He traveled to the [[Mission San Gabriel Arc<U+00E1>ngel]], where he served as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. By 1837, he received word that Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu had died and that the King of Hawaii, [[Kamehameha III]], was willing to allow Catholic priests on the island again. He returned to Hawaii in 1837, intending to continue his missionary work. After arriving in Honolulu, he learned that King Kamehameha III had changed his mind and would not allow Catholic priests on the island. He was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months, before being freed from the ship after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. He was later able to secure passage on a ship to [[Micronesia]]. He died en route to the islands and was buried near [[Pohnpei]]. The treatment that he had received in Hawaii prompted the [[July Monarchy|Government of France]] to dispatch another frigate to the island. The resulting intervention is known as [[French Incident (Hawaii)|The French Incident]] and led to the emancipation of Catholics in Hawaii.

==Early life==
Alexis Bachelot was born as '''Jean Augustin Bachelot''' in [[Saint-Cyr-la-Rosi<U+00E8>re]], [[Orne]], France on February 22, 1796.<ref name=jfs/> In 1806, he left home for Paris and enrolled in the Preparatory Seminary of Piepus to pursue priesthood. Seven years later, he professed at the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary<ref name=y6/> and took the name Alexis.<ref name=jfs/> He studied at the Irish College in Paris before being ordained as a priest in 1820. He subsequently served as the rector of the College. He later became the superior of the preparatory seminary at [[Tours]].<ref name=y6>Yzendoor 1914, p. 6</ref>

==Hawaiian mission==
In the early 1820s, [[Jean Baptiste Rives]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a French adviser of the King of Hawaii [[Kamehameha II]]&nbsp;<U+2013> traveled to Europe and attempted to convince European Catholics to organize a mission to Hawaii. He spoke with members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, who were particularly receptive to his ideas.<ref name=k139/> In 1825, [[Pope Leo XII]] assigned them with the task of evangelizing Hawaii<ref name=g49>Garrett 1982, p. 49</ref> and appointed Bachelot as the Prefect Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands. In this role, he led the first mission to Hawaii.<ref name=g50>Garrett 1982, p. 50</ref> Bachelot was assisted in his new position by two fellow priests, [[Patrick Short]] and [[Abraham Armand]], and several [[lay brother]]s. They sailed from [[Bordeaux]] on ''La Com<U+00E8>te'' in November&nbsp;1826. The expedition was funded by the [[Bourbon Restoration|Government of France]] and was organized by the [[Monneron family]], who were influential French bankers. The missionaries were accompanied by a group that planned to explore commercial trading opportunities.<ref name=k139>Kuykendall 1938, p. 139</ref>
[[File:Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace east.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]] in 2006]]
The ''La Com<U+00E8>te'' arrived in [[Honolulu]] on July&nbsp;7, 1827. The priests were faced with a difficult financial situation because of the absence of Rives' patronage.<ref name=g50/> His influence on the government had dissipated after the death of King Kamehameha II<ref name=k140/> in July 1824.<ref name=k138>Kuykendall 1938, p. 138</ref> As King Kamehameha III was a child at the time of the death of Kamehameha II, Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu ruled as Queen Regent.<ref name=k1334>Kuykendall 1938, p. 133-134</ref> She viewed Rives with animosity and he did not return to Hawaii.<ref name=k140/> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu took a hard stance against Catholicism on the advice of [[Hiram Bingham I]], a Protestant missionary who had converted the Hawaiian royalty years earlier. The priests encountered suspicion from most chiefs due to fears that they were covert agents of the Government of France.<ref name=g50/> A favorable response, however, greeted the group when they met [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]], a chief from [[Oahu]] who had converted to Catholicism. Though Boki welcomed the party and gave them permission to stay,<ref name=g49/> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu instructed the captain of ''La Com<U+00E8>te'' to take them with him when he departed. The captain, however, neglected to do so and the party was able to remain.<ref name=k140>Kuykendall 1938, p. 140</ref> [[John Coffin Jones]] and [[Richard Charlton (Hawaii)|Richard Charlton]], the respective American and British Consuls, appreciated the group's efforts, believing that the presence of French citizens could be beneficial for trade reasons.<ref name=g50/>

For several months, Bachelot and his fellow missionaries lived in three small rented structures,<ref name=k140/> saying their first mass on the island in a [[grass hut]].<ref name=kelley/> They later built a chapel on a small plot of land they purchased,<ref name=k140/> where the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace]]<ref name=t45/> was dedicated in 1843.<ref name=kelley/> After settling on the island, the group avoided drawing attention and studied the [[Hawaiian language]].<ref name=t45>Tabrah 1984, p. 45</ref> At the time they arrived, none of the party was fluent in English or Hawaiian.<ref name=g50/> During the first two years of their mission, the group converted 65 Hawaiians<ref name=t45/> and ministered to Hawaiians who had been converted with Boki.<ref name=g51>Garrett 1982, p. 51</ref> They often held surreptitious night-time meetings with converts who feared persecution.<ref name=kelley>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Charlotte|title=The Church in Hawaii|journal=Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review|month=September 1948|volume=37|issue=147|pages=333<U+2013>341}}</ref> The priests' vestments and rituals gave a fillip to their evangelism because they reminded Hawaiians of native religious customs.<ref name=g51/>

Bachelot introduced two plant species to Hawaii: the ''[[Prosopis humilis]]''<ref name=Hall/> and the ''[[Bougainvillea]]''.<ref name=scott>Scott 1991, p. 55</ref> ''Prosopis humilis'' trees later covered thousands of acres there.<ref name=Hall>Hall 1904, p. 9</ref> He had attained the seeds, which were originally gathered by Catholic missionaries in California, from the Royal Conservatory in Paris.<ref name=t45/> Bachelot translated a book of prayers into Hawaiian (''O ke Ao Ana Kristiano'', c. 1831),<ref name=f19>Forbes 2000, p. 19</ref> authored a [[catechism]] in Hawaiian (''He Olelo Hoonaau'', 1831),<ref name=f15>Forbes 2000, p. 15</ref> and wrote an introduction to Hawaiian grammar in French (''Notes Gramaticales'', 1834).<ref name=f87>Forbes 2000, p. 87</ref>

==Persecution==
[[File:Reine Cahoumanou.jpg|thumb|right|1816 painting of Queen [[Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu]], who deported Bachelot from Hawaii in 1831.]]
By 1827, Protestant Christianity&nbsp;<U+2014> particularly Bingham's teachings<ref name=t456>Tabrah 1984, p. 45<U+2013>46</ref>&nbsp;<U+2013> had become the ''de facto'' state religion of the Kingdom of Hawaii.<ref name=k140/> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu persecuted Catholics from 1829 until her death in 1832, forbidding Hawaiians from attending masses and instructing Bachelot not to proselytize.<ref name=t456/> In December&nbsp;1831, Bachelot and Short were deported and forced to leave on a ship, the ''Waverly'', bound for North America.<ref name=k142>Kuykendall 1938, p. 142</ref> Though she steadfastly opposed his work, Bachelot viewed Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu as a good person who had been deceived by Protestant missionaries.<ref name=k133>Kuykendall 1938, p. 133</ref>

The news of Bachelot and Short's expulsion caused controversy in the United States, where it was viewed as contrary to the treaty signed by Commodore [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]] of the [[United States Navy]] and King Kamehameha III in 1826. U.S. Navy Commodore [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]] protested the expulsions during his discussions with chiefs while he visited the kingdom in 1832.<ref name=k144>Kuykendall 1938, p. 144</ref>

==California==
The ''Waverly'' landed at a vacant area near San Pedro, Los Angeles, in January&nbsp;1832.<ref name=ol66>Older 1938, p. 66</ref> By that time, the ship was running very low on food and water.<ref name=ol67>Older 1938, p. 67</ref> Bachelot and Short traveled to the Mission San Gabriel Arc<U+00E1>ngel,<ref name=k143/> where they were welcomed by the [[Franciscans]] who staffed the mission.<ref name=kelley/> Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles,<ref name=ol67/> served as an assistant minister for the mission,<ref name=b317>Bancroft 1902, p. 317</ref> and led the mission on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834.<ref name=ol67/> He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage.<ref name=g180/> He ministered in California until 1837<ref name=k143>Kuykendall 1938, p. 143</ref> and became popular with Angelenos.<ref name=g180/>

[[File:KamehamehaIII.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of King [[Kamehameha III]] in 1824]]
In 1833, the [[Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] reorganized the jurisdiction of [[Oceania]]. Hawaii became part of the newly created [[Apostolic Vicariate of Eastern Oceania]], which was split into northern and southern divisions. Bachelot remained as the Prefect Apostolic for the northern division. Bishop [[Etienne Jerome Rouchouze]] served as the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania and oversaw Bachelot's assignment in Hawaii.<ref name=k143/>

In 1835 and 1836, two representatives of the Catholic Church traveled to Hawaii in an attempt to ascertain whether Bachelot could return.<ref name=k144<U+2013>145>Kuykendall 1938, p. 144<U+2013>145</ref> Queen Ka<U+02BB>ahumanu had died in 1832, and the next year King Kamehameha III began making radical changes to Hawaiian law.<ref name=k1334/> Columban Murphy, a British lay brother, visited King Kamehameha III in 1835 and discussed the possibility of Bachelot's return.<ref name=g53/> Finding King Kamehameha III amenable to the idea, Murphy traveled to California to relay the news. He was unable, however, to locate Bachelot, who was on a journey at the time. After Bachelot received Murphy's message, Short and he decided to return to Hawaii.<ref name=g53>Garrett 1982, p. 53</ref> The [[Ayuntamiento]] in Los Angeles, a municipal council, attempted to dissuade Bachelot<ref name=b318>Bancroft 1902, p. 318</ref> and asked the Catholic leadership in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] to prevent him from leaving,<ref name=g180>Gonz<U+00E1>lez 2005, p. 180</ref> but he insisted on leaving<ref name=b318/> and the Catholic leadership did not prevent him.<ref name=g180/>

==Later life==
After Bachelot and Short arrived in Honolulu in the spring of 1837, they spent 13 days on the island before being confined to the ship on which they had arrived, the ''Clementine'',<ref name=rw/> on May 22.<ref name=d68/> Though he had previously signed an agreement with the [[French Navy|French Naval]] Captain [[Abel Aubert Dupetit Thouars]] that allowed French citizens to live on the island,<ref name=M214>McDougall 2004, p. 214</ref> King Kamehameha III sought to deport the priests and ban the teaching of Catholicism. The captain of the ''Clementine'', Jules Dudoit, refused to transport them from Hawaii.<ref name=rw>Rayson & Wong 1987, p. 105<U+2013>106</ref> Dudoit, a British citizen of French descent, met with Charlton and they publicly protested the priests' confinement.<ref name=d68>Daws 1968, p. 95</ref> Their efforts to secure the freedom of the priests to live on the island were unsuccessful<ref name=g53/> until the HMS ''Sulpher'' and the French frigate ''La V<U+00E8>nus'' arrived in Honolulu. The ships were commanded by [[Edward Belcher]] and Dupetit Thouars, who tried to convince the authorities to allow the priests to return to the island. After negotiations proved futile, they blockaded the harbor<ref name=d68/> in mid-July and allowed Bachelot and Short to come ashore.<ref name=k149>Kuykendall 1938, p. 149</ref> ''La V<U+00E8>nus'' sent 300 sailors to escort them from the harbor to the French mission. King Kamehameha III agreed to allow the priests to stay in Honolulu until they could find a ship to transport them elsewhere, under the condition that they refrained from proselytizing.<ref name=d68/>

That year, Bachelot, who suffered from a form of [[rheumatism]],<ref name=g54>Garrett 1982, p. 54</ref> became very sick.<ref name=kelley/> By November&nbsp;1837, he recovered and left Hawaii. He purchased a ship<ref name=g54/> and sailed toward Micronesia, intending to work on a mission.<ref name=g53/> Bachelot's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii<ref name=jfs/> and he died at sea on December 5, 1987.<ref name=k150>Kuykendall 1938, p. 150</ref> He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.<ref name=jfs>{{cite journal|last=Pietrusewsky|first=Michael|coauthors=Lisa Willacker|title=The search for Father Bachelot: first Catholic missionary to the Hawaiian Islands (1827<U+2013>1837)|journal=[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]|year=1997|month=March|volume=42|issue=2|pages=208<U+2013>212}}</ref>

Due to the persecution of Bachelot and his fellow priests, the Government of France sent the frigate ''Art<U+00E9>mise'' to Hawaii in 1839. Its Captain, [[Cyrille Pierre Th<U+00E9>odore Laplace]], had been instructed to force the government to stop persecuting Catholics. In response to this show of force, King Kamehameha III [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|granted Catholics]] the freedom of religion.<ref name=k165>Kuykendall 1938, p. 165</ref>
