The '''Near South Side''' is an officially designated [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] (neighborhood) in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], [[United States|USA]]. It is located just south of the downtown central business district, [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]], which is itself a [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].  The Near South Side's boundaries (see [http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/Community_Areas_NEAR_SOUTH_SIDE.pdf map]) are as follows: North<U+2014>Roosevelt Road (1200 S); South<U+2014>26th Street; West<U+2014>[[Chicago River]] between Roosevelt and 18th Street, Clark Street between 18th Street and 22nd Street, Federal between 22nd and the [[Stevenson Expressway]] just south of 25th Street, and Clark Street again between the [[Stevenson Expressway|Stevenson]] and 26th Street; and East<U+2014>[[Lake Michigan]].

The portion of the Near South Side located east of [[Lake Shore Drive]] contains some of the most well-known structures in Chicago: [[Soldier Field]] (the home of the [[National Football League]] [[Chicago Bears]]), the eastern half of [[McCormick Place]] (Chicago's primary convention center), the [[Museum Campus]] (which contains the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], the [[Shedd Aquarium]], and the [[Adler Planetarium]]), and [[Northerly Island]].  The remaining area is currently undergoing a major residential and mixed-use redevelopment. As part of the [[Chicago 2016 Olympic bid]], the [[Olympic Village]] is planned to be located on a 37 acre truck parking lot south of McCormick Place that is mostly in the [[Douglas, Chicago|Douglas]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] and partly in the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=22191|accessdate=April 2|accessyear=2007|2006-09-23|author=Hinz, Greg|title=Plan for 2016 Olympics disclosed|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.}}</ref>

==History==
The Near South Side is one of the most dynamic of Chicago's communities.  It has undergone a metamorphosis from a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] homeland to a blue collar settlement, to an elite socialite residential district, to a center for vice, to a slum, to a public housing and warehouse district, and finally to the home of a newly gentrified residential district.<ref name="EOCNSS2-3">McClendon, Dennis, ''Near South Side'', pp. 562-563, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>

===Beginnings and continuous change===
This area was first populated by settlers working for the [[Illinois & Michigan Canal]], who subsequently worked in the lumber district.  Proximity to the railroads attracted light manufacturing and shops.  In 1853, the community was absorbed by the extension of the city limits to 31st Street.  By the time of the [[Great Chicago Fire]] in 1871, it was home to some of the city's finest mansions and most elite social families.  However, by the turn of the century, rapid transit evolved and many families moved slightly farther from the Loop business district.  [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] between 14th Street and 22nd Street became "Auto Row".  The "Levee" vice district around Cermak Street and State Street prospered until 1912.  [[World War I]] and post [[World War I]] [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] settlers moved in and created the low-rent "Black Belt". Urban renewal and public housing projects later replaced some of the slums.<ref name="EOCNSS2">McClendon, Dennis, ''Near South Side'', p. 562, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>  In the 1940s, the city<U+2019>s worst slums were on the Near South Side.<ref name="EOCED">deVise, Pierre, ''Eminent Domain'', p. 269, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>

===Modern day===
[[Image:20070110 Dearborn Park.JPG|120px|thumb|left|Dearborn Park II Development]]
The Near South Side consisted largely of railroad tracks and interchanges until the 1960s, when middle-class housing developments were built in the community area.  In 1977, [[George Halas]] surrendered 51 acres of railyards for redevelopment as Dearborn Park apartments, townhouses and accompanying tree-lined walkways.<ref name="EOCDP">Gellman, Erik, ''Dearborn Park'', p. 230, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref>  In 1988, the second phase of Dearborn Park construction began between State St. and  Clark St., south of Roosevelt Rd.<ref name="EOCNSS3">McClendon, Dennis, ''Near South Side'', p. 563, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref> A housing boom emerged in the 1990s and continues to the present day with the construction of many new condominium and apartment towers.

Construction of the [[Central Station (Chicago neighborhood)|Central Station]] development commenced in 1990.  This was a mixed-use development on 72 acres of former rail yards and air rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street.  Simultaneously, loft conversion spread to the warehouses and light manufacturing structures along the major north-south Avenues of Michigan, Indiana, and Wabash, which returned them to residential properties 100 years after the flight of the elite Chicago socialites.<ref name="EOCDP">Gellman, Erik, ''Dearborn Park'', p. 230, Eds.

==Parks and museums==

''See [[Burnham Park (Chicago)|Burnham Park]] for more information''

Landfill use created Burnham Park and [[Northerly Island]] in the 1920s and 1930s along [[Lake Michigan]].  The Field Museum of Natural History, Soldier Field, Adler Planetarium and the John G. Shedd Aquarium found homes on the land during this time.  Later, [[Merrill C. Meigs Field]] Airport was built.  

The newly developed Central Station area includes three park areas.  Mark Twain Park lies between South Indiana Avenue and Lake Shore Drive at 14th Street.  Daniel Webster Park is bounded by 15th Street, South Indiana Avenue and townhouse developments.  The Grant Park Extension lies east of [[One Museum Park]] and South of Roosevelt.

=== McCormick Place ===
Fairs and exhibitions held on the lakefront cites created demand for an exhibition hall.  In 1960, construction was begun on [[McCormick Place]], a huge exposition and convention complex at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named for newspaper magnate [[Robert R. McCormick]]. The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 at the behest of mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007.<ref name="EOCNSS3"> </ref>  The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodations.  McCormick Place also houses the [[Arie Crown Theatre]], and is the annual location for the [[Chicago Auto Show]].

===Historic structures===
The region includes the [[Prairie Avenue]] Historic District and the historic (former) [[RR Donnelley|R. R. Donnelley & Sons]] printing company building (which now houses network routers and switches for much of the city).

==Redevelopment==
[[Image:20070122 Near South Side Model from Museum Park Sales Center.JPG|150px|thumb|right|[[Central Station (Chicago neighborhood)|Central Station]] and [[Museum Campus]] model]]South Loop residential development has expanded to the Dearborn Park neighborhood (between State and Clark Streets South of Roosevelt Road). The new [[Central Station (Chicago neighborhood)|Central Station neighborhood]] is the site of major mixed use development that includes [[One Museum Park]], [[One Museum Park West]], numerous residential condominiums and luxury townhomes.  This development is built on 72 acres of former rail yards and air space rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street that include the former location of the [[Central Station (Chicago)|Central Station terminal]].  Also, a wave of loft conversions in Printer's Row that has spread to major North-South Avenues such as Michigan, Wabash, and Indiana is making them residential streets again in this neighborhood after a century of other uses.<ref name="EOCNSS3"> </ref>  The planned development has expanded from 69 to 80 acres and includes properties between Michigan and Indiana Avenues.

==Streets==
[[Lake Shore Drive]] was reconstructed in 1996 so that it no longer cut through the Museum Campus.  Previously the northbound lane ran east of Soldier Field.  After reconstruction both lanes ran west of Soldier Field.<ref>{{cite web |month=Aug|year=1997|author=|publisher=Chicago Public Library|url=http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/timeline/lakeshore_1996.html |title= Chicago Timeline 1996: Lake Shore Drive Moves West |accessdate=2007-01-17 }}</ref>

Its northern boundary (Roosevelt Road) marks the end of consecutively named east-west streets.  East-west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] and [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]].  There are two block-long 8th and 11th Streets and a four-block 9th Street.   Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers.  Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered.  Cermak Road (22nd Street) is one of the few named east-west cross streets.  Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile.

==South Loop/Printer's Row controversy==
There is some confusion regarding where the [[Chicago_Loop#South_Loop|South Loop]] neighborhood (which incorporates Printer's Row) is located.  Some sources don't define its northern boundary, while defining its southern boundary as Cermak Street (22nd Street) and its western boundary as Canal Street. ''The Greater South Loop Association'' represents residents living between Congress to the North, the [[Chicago River]] to the west and the Stevenson Expressway (approximately 25th Street) to the south.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Greater South Loop Association |date= |accessdate= February 26 | accessyear= 2007| url= http://www.greatersouthloop.org/ |title=  Bringing Neighbors Together . . . }}</ref>  ''South Loop Neighbors'' serves residents only as far South as "approximately" 15th Street and as far west as the river.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=South Loop Neighbors |date= |accessdate= February 26 | accessyear= 2007| url= http://www.southloopneighbors.org/hprn/who.htm |title= Who We Are }}</ref> The South Loop is described as the neighborhood immediately south of "the Loop", yet "the Loop" has multiple meanings. [[The Loop]] is a community area bounded by the [[Chicago River]], [[Lake Michigan]] and Roosevelt Road.  However, the term is also used to refer to the specific area bounded by the circular portion of the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[L Train]], which goes as far south as Van Buren Street or Congress Avenue (and this is described as the northern border of Printer's Row and the South Loop).  Some primary sources cite [[Printer's Row]] and the South Loop as part of the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]].<ref name="EOCPR">Gellman, Erik, ''Printer's Row'', p. 646, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref><ref name="EOCSL">McClendon, Dennis, ''South Loop'', p. 770, Eds. Grossman, James R., Keating, Ann Durkin, and Reiff, Janice L., 2004 ''The Encyclopedia of Chicago''. The University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-31015-9</ref> This transit-related area is the northern portion of the community area.  Saying it is south of the former places it in the Near South Side, while saying it is part of the latter places it in the Loop.  The [http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/Community_Areas_LOOP.pdf Official City of Chicago Loop Map] supports the latter.
