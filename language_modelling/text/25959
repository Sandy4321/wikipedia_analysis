'''Hizaki''' (stylized as '''HIZAKI''') is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[visual kei]] musician, songwriter and record producer. He is best known as guitarist for the [[symphonic metal]] band [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]]. Before forming Versailles he was in several independent bands and had a solo career, and when they disbanded he and most of the other members formed [[Jupiter (band)|Jupiter]].

==Biography==
Hizaki debuted as guitarist for the Kyoto based band Garnet Grave in 1997. After two years, Hizaki and bassist Hizumi departed from Garnet Grave to form Crack Brain with guitarist Airi (Madeth Gray'll).

In 2002, Crack Brain disbanded and Hizaki and Airi formed the band {{Nihongo||<U+30B0><U+30ED><U+30C6><U+30B9><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+30C6><U+30A3><U+30C3><U+30AB><U+30FC>|Gurotesuku Romantikkaa}}, who in May 2003 changed their name to Schwardix Marvally.<ref name="Crack Brain Profile">{{cite web| title = Crack Brain JaME Profile| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/artists-biography-24-crack-brain.html| accessdate = 2011-04-03}}</ref> They released two [[Extended Play|EPs]], one composed of cover songs from various bands. Soon after releasing the two EPs, Schwardix Marvally disbanded in 2004.
 
Hizaki then proceeded to start a solo career that same year and released ''Maiden Ritual''.<ref name="Hizaki Profile">{{cite web| title = Hizaki JaME Profile| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/artists-biography-417-hizaki-grace-project.html| accessdate = 2011-04-03}}</ref> He published two more EPs: ''Dance with Grace'' and ''Maiden Ritual -Experiment Edition-'' with a variety of musicians in the [[visual kei]] scene. In 2005 he put his solo work on hold and joined Sulfuric Acid, staying until they disbanded in October 2006.<ref name="Hizaki Profile" /> On October 31, Hizaki supported [[Lareine]] at their last concert.<ref name="Lareine support">{{cite web| title = Hizaki to Help Lareine| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/news-18002-hizaki-to-help-lareine.html| accessdate = 2012-01-09}}</ref>

He then restarted solo activities and formed his solo group, Hizaki Grace Project, with Hikaru ([[Izabel Varosa]]) on vocals, [[Jasmine You|Yuu]] (Jakura) on bass and support drummer Seiji (Sulfuric Acid). After recruiting Mikage (Babylon) on drums, [[Teru (guitarist)|Teru]] (Aikaryu) on guitar and [[Shaura|Juka]] ([[Moi dix Mois]]) on vocals, they released the album ''Dignity of Crest''. Hizaki Grace Project's latest album, ''Curse of Virgo'', was released on December 26, 2007, two days after their latest live performance.

In early 2007, he became support for [[Node of Scherzo]], a project fronted by [[Kamijo (musician)|Kamijo]] (Lareine), Juka and [[Kaya (Japanese musician)|Kaya]] ([[Schwarz Stein]]), and also supported by [[Jasmine You]] and Asagi ([[D (band)|D]]). At Node of Scherzo's first live performance on March 14, Kamijo and Hizaki announced they were forming a band together. On March 30 the details of the band were announced, it would be named [[Versailles (band)|Versailles]] and also included drummer Yuki (Sugar Trip) and Hizaki Grace Project's Jasmine You and Teru. Hizaki's solo work was put on hold while he focused on Versailles.

On September 23, 2008, Hizaki modeled clothing for [[Baby, The Stars Shine Bright]] on the runway at Individual Fashion Expo IV.<ref name="runway model">{{cite web| title = Individual Fashion EXPO IV - Backstage Interviews| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-5997-individual-fashion-expo-iv-backstage-interviews.html| accessdate = 2012-01-09}}</ref> On July 15, 2010, he partook in the one-night only revival of Crack Brain, at a concert for their old record label, Crow Music.

In January 2011, he and the rest of Versailles started starring in their own TV mini drama called {{Nihongo|''Onegai Kanaete Versailles''|<U+304A><U+306D><U+304C><U+3044><U+304B><U+306A><U+3048><U+3066><U+30F4><U+30A7><U+30EB><U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30E6>||"Fulfill My Wish Versailles"}}.
