'''Hoysala architecture''' is the distinctive building style developed under the rule of the [[Hoysala Empire]] in the region historically known as ''Karnata'', today's [[Karnataka]], [[India]], between the 11th and the 14th centuries.  Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the [[Deccan Plateau|Southern Deccan]] Plateau region.  Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the [[Chennakesava Temple]] at [[Belur]], the [[Hoysaleswara temple|Hoysaleswara Temple]] at [[Halebidu]], and the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Kesava Temple]] at [[Somanathapura]]. Other examples of fine Hoysala craftmanship are the temples at [[Belavadi]], [[Amrithapura]], and [[Nuggehalli]]. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible  Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.<ref name="distinct">Percy Brown in Kamath (2001), p134</ref>

The vigourous temple building activity of the Hoysala Empire was due to the social, cultural and political events of the period. The stylistic transfomation of the ''Karnata'' temple building tradition reflected religious trends popularized by the [[Vaishnava]] and [[Virashaiva]] philosophers as well as the growing military prowess of the Hoysala kings who desired to surpass their [[Western Chalukya]] overlords in artistic achievement. Temples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to Chalukyan art but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans.  About one hundred temples have survived in present-day Karnataka state, mostly in the [[Malnad]] (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.

As popular tourist destinations in Karnataka, Hoysala temples offer an excellent opportunity for pilgrims and students of architecture to examine [[medieval]] Hindu architecture in the ''Karnata Dravida'' tradition. This tradition  began in the 7th century under the patronage of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] of [[Badami]], developed further under the Western Chalukyas of [[Basavakalyan]] in the 11th century and finally transformed into an independent style by the 12th century during the reign of the Hoysalas.  Medieval [[Kannada language]] inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give details of the temples and offer valuable information about the  history of the Hoysala dynasty.

Hinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals,  daily practices, and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies  complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy. 
Hindu temples began as simple shrines housing a diety and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into  impressive  edifices of worship and transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples  were not limited to any specific organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu [[Devotional cults in India|devotional cult]]s. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples  to Lord [[Shiva]] or to  Lord [[Vishnu]] (two of the major Hindu  gods) but they occasionally chose a different deity. Shiva followers are called Shaivas or [[Lingayat]]s and the Vishnu followers  are called [[Vaishnava]]s. While King [[Vishnuvardhana]] and his descendents were Vaishnava by faith,<ref name="vaishnava">Kamath (2001), p132</ref> records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu.<ref name="equal">Foekema (1996), p19</ref> Most of these temples have [[secular]] features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous [[Chennakeshava temple]] at [[Belur]] dedicated to [[Vishnu]] and in the [[Hoysaleswara temple]] at [[Halebidu]] dedicated to [[Shiva]]. The Keshava temple at [[Somanathapura]] is  different in that its ornamentation  is strictly Vaishnavan.<ref name="secular">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S.|publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu|work=Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 08, April 12 - 25, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to [[Keshava]] (or Chennakeshava meaning Beautiful Vishnu) while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha are both Vishnu  bodily manifestations of the god or [[avatars]]) with [[Lakshmi]], consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity. The [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] temples have a [[Lingam|Shiva linga]], symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the [[shrine]]. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix ''eshwara'' meaning ''Lord of''. The name Hoysaleswara for instance means ''Lord of Hoysala''. The temple can also be named after a devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala named after a devotee Buci.<ref name="name">Foekema (1996), p19-20</ref> The most striking sculptural decorations are  the horizontal rows of exquisitely detailed, intricately carved images of Gods, Goddesses and their attendants on the temple outer wall panels.
The [[Doddagaddavalli]] Lakshmi Devi temple (Goddess of wealth) is an exception as it deifies neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] (of present day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in early 11th century and the rising numbers of  followers of [[Vaishnava|Vaishnava Hinduism]] and [[Virashaivism]] in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in [[Jainism]].<ref name="jain">Kamath (2001), pp 112, 132</ref> However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were [[Shravanabelagola]] and [[Kambadahalli]]. The Hoysalas built [[Jain]] temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in [[Halebidu]] containing icons of Jain [[tirthankaras]]. They constructed stepped wells called ''Pushkarni'' or ''Kalyani'', the ornate [[temple tank|tank]] at Hulikere being a example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.<ref name="tank">Foekema (1996), plate 27</ref>

The two main  deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Lord [[Shiva]] and Lord [[Vishnu]] in their various forms and [[avatar]]s (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a [[trident]] and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshipped independently of the divine image with which they are associated.<ref name="Shiva">Foekema (1996), p31</ref> Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, [[Parvathi]]. Various depictions of Lord [[Shiva]] show him in action, such as slaying a demon or dancing on the head of an elephant. He is often accompanied by his consort, [[Parvati]] or shown with [[Nandi]] the bull. He  may be represented as [[Bhairava]], another of [[Shiva]]'s many manifestations. 

A male icon depicted holding certain objects  such as a [[conch]] (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is [[Vishnu]]. If a female icon is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, [[Lakshmi]]. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] and a [[mace]]. These  can be held in any of the icon's hands, making possible twenty four different  forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name.<ref name="vishnu">Foekema (1996), p32</ref> Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten [[Avatars#The Ten Avatars of Vishnu.2C or Dasavatara|''avataras'']] (bodily manifestations) which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (celestial snake and keeper of life energy), with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disemboweling a demon on his lap ([[Narasimha|Lakshminarasimha]]), with head of a boar walking over a demon ([[Varaha]]), in the [[Krishna]] avatar (as [[Sree Venugopala|Venugopala]] or the cow herder playing the [[Venu]] (flute}, dancing on the head of the snake [[Kaliya]], lifting a hill such as [[Govardhana]]), with his feet over head of a small figure (''[[Vamana]]''), with [[Lakshmi]] seated on [[Garuda]], and the eagle (stealing the [[Pandanus fascicularis|parijata tree]]).

A Hindu temple is a place of contact between the gods or deities and man. The focus of a temple is the centre or [[sanctum sanctorum]] ([[garbhagriha]]) where the image of the deity resides, so  temple architecture is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for [[circumambulation]] and halls or chambers (''[[mandapa|mantapas]]'')  that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.
Hoysala temples have distinct parts that are merged to form a unified whole, in contrast to the temples of [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil country]] where different parts of a temple stand independently.<ref name="parts">Foekema (1996), p21</ref> Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiseled of  soft [[soapstone]] (chloritic schist) , a good material for intricate [[Stone carving|carving]], executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.<ref name="soap">Kamath (2001), p136</ref> 

Most Hoysala temples have a plain covered entrance [[porch]] supported by [[lathe]] turned (circular or bell-shaped) [[Columns|pillars]]  which were sometimes further carved with deep fluting and moulded with decorative motifs. The temples may be built upon a platform raised by about a metre called  ''jagati''. The ''jagati'', apart from giving a raised look to the temple, serves as a ''[[Pradakshina|Pradakshinapatha]]'' for circumambulation around the temple as the ''[[Garbhagriha|garbagriha]]'' ([[Sanctum sanctorum|inner sanctum]]) provides no such feature.<ref name="pradakshina">Kamath (2001), p135</ref> Such temples will have an additional set of steps leading to an open ''[[mantapa]]'' (open hall) with  [[parapet]] walls. A good example of this style is the [[Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura|Keshava Temple]] at Somanathapura. The ''jagati'' which is in unity with the rest of the temple<ref name="prefect">Foekema (1996), p25</ref> follows a star-shape design and the walls of the temple follow a zig-zag pattern, a Hoysala innovation.<ref name=innovate">{{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Religion, Literature, Art and Architecture in Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> A pair of small shrines, each with a deity and a miniature tower directly facing the entrance could adorn either side of steps of the ''Jagati''. This would be repeated for all entrances leading to the ''Jagati''. 
Devotees can first complete a ritual [[circumambulation]] on the ''jagati'' starting from the main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the ''mantapa'', following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced [[reliefs]] (sequence of epic scenes) on the outside temple walls depicting the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a ''jagati'' can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades ([[parapet]]s) that lead to the ''mantapa'' from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the ''Bucesvara'' temple in Korvangla, [[Hassan District]]. In temples with two shrines (''dvikuta''), the ''[[Vimana (shrine)|vimanas]]'' (shrine or [[cella]]) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides.<ref name="adjacent>The Hoysaleswara shrine and Shantaleswara shrine in the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu are  examples. (Foekema 1996, p59)</ref> The Lakshmidevi temple at [[Doddagaddavalli]] has a minor shrine at each of  the four corners of the walled temple complex in addition to five major shrines.

==Architectural elements==
===Mantapa===
[[Image:Belur2.JPG|thumb|left|Ornate [[lintel]] over mantapa entrance]]
The ''[[mantapa]]'' is the hall where groups of people gather during prayers. The entrance to the ''mantapa'' normally has a highly ornate overhead [[lintel]] called a ''makaratorana'' (''makara'' is an imaginery beast and ''torana'' is a overhead decoration).<ref name="makara">Kamath (2001), p135</ref> The open ''mantapa'' which serves the purpose of a outer hall (outer ''mantapa'') is a regular feature in larger Hoysala  temples leading to an inner small closed ''mantapa'' and the shrine(s). The open ''mantapas'' have seating areas made of stone with the ''mantapa's'' parapet wall  acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The open ''mantapa'' is the largest part of the temple and is the place supporting larger congregations of people. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays.<ref name="bay">A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall (Foekema 1996, p93)</ref> The shape of the open ''mantapa'' is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples.<ref name="stagger">This is also called "cross-in-square" style and is not a square (Foekema, 1996, p22)</ref> Even the smallest open ''mantapa'' has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The ''mantapa'' ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contain sculputral depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.<ref name="banana">{{cite web|title=Here, the past unfolds itself in all its glory & might -Hoyasala architecture in Somanathapura|url=http://www.chitralakshana.com/articles/UB%20githa/hoysala.htm|author=Githa U.B.|publisher=Chitralakshana|work=Deccan Herald, Tuesday, May 11, 2004|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> The Amritheswara temple in [[Chikmagalur district]] has forty eight domes in the ''mahamantapa'' (great open hall).  
[[Image:Chikkamagalur Amritheswara navaranga.JPG|left|thumb|Open ''Mantapa'' with shining, lathe-turned pillars at [[Amrithapura]]]]
If the temple is small it will consist of only a closed ''mantapa'' (enclosed with walls extending all the way to the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed ''mantapa'', well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the ''mantapa'' and has four lathe turned pillars to support the ceiling which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine finely decorated ceilings.<ref name="nine">The 4 pillars and 9 bays of a closed ''mantapa'' is a norm in Hoysala temples (Foekema 1996, p22)</ref> Pierced stone [[latticework]] screens placed  between pillars to filter the light is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.

A porch adorns the entrance to a closed mantapa consisting of an awning supported by two half pillars ([[engaged column]]s)  and two parapets all richly decorated. The closed ''mantapa'' is connected to the shrine(s) by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are finely decorated but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the ''sukanasi'' or "nose"<ref name="nose"> It is called "nose" because it looks like an extension of the main tower (Foekema 1996, p22)</ref> upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem. In [[Belur]] and [[Halebidu]], these sculptures are quite large and are placed at all doorways.

The outer and inner ''mantapa'' (open and closed) have circular [[lathe]] turned pillars<ref name="lathe">This is a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples (Kamath 2001, p117)</ref> having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figure(s) called [[salabhanjika]] or ''madanika''. The pillars may also exibit fine ornamental carvings  on the surface and no two pillars are alike.<ref name="unique">It is possible that the Hoysalas encouraged different groups of artists to execute pillars and these groups may have been in competition to produce unique pillars, (Sastri 1955, p429)</ref> This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the [[Western Chalukyas]], who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The lathe turned pillars are either 16, 32 or 64 pointed; some are bell shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example.<ref name="lightreflection">{{cite web|title=Architecture in Hoysala Empire|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/history.htm|author=Arthikaje|publisher=1998-2000 OurKarnataka.Com,Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-12-28}}</ref> The shaft of the pillar is a [[monolith]] with the base left as a square and beautifully sculptured figures adorn the top.

[[Image:roofarchitecture som.JPG|right|thumb|Star shaped ''Vimana'' at [[Somanathapura]]]]

===Vimana===
The ''[[Vimana (shrine)|vimana]]'', also called the [[cella]], contains the most sacred shrine wherein resides the image of the presiding deity. The ''vimana'' is often topped by a tower which is quite different outside than inside. Inside the vimana is plain and square whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either star shaped or staggered square or a combination of these in design, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as lighting falls on it.<ref name="cross-in-square">Foekema (1996), p21</ref> Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and comprised of blocks and [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]s, obscuring the tower profile.  Depending on the number of shrines (and hence number of towers), the temples are classified as ''ekakuta'' (one), ''dvikuta'' (two), ''trikuta'' (three), ''chatushkuta'' (four) and ''panchakuta'' (five). Most Hoysala temples are ''ekakuta'', ''dvikuta'' or ''trikuta''.<ref name=kuta">Sometimes a ''trikuta'' may not literally mean three towers as only the central shrine has a tower (Foekema 1996, p25)</ref> In temples with multiple shrines, all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance. A temple's minor shrine usually has its own tower. There are cases where a temple is ''trikuta'' but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology ''trikuta'' may not be literally true. Smaller shrines attached to the outer walls and facing outward  from a larger ''vimana'' are a common feature.

The highest point of the temple (''kalasa'') has the shape of a beautiful water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the ''vimana'' is often lost due to age and replaced with a metallic pinnacle. Below the ''kalasa'' is a large, highly sculptured  structure resembling a dome which is  made from large stones and looks like a helmet.<ref name="helmet">Foekema (1996), p27</ref> It may be 2&nbsp;m by 2&nbsp;m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small ''kalasas''. They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of  rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the ''sukanasi'' has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower ("nose"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed ''mantapa'' above the heavy eaves of an open ''mantapa'' and above the porches.
[[Image:Somanathapura wall-panel.jpg|thumb|right|Outer wall panel with six horizontal mouldings at [[Somanathapura]]]]
Below the superstructure of the ''[[vimana (tower)|vimana]]'' are temple "[[eave]]s"<ref name="eave"> under the projecting roof overhanging the wall (Foekema 1996, p93)</ref>  projecting half a meter from the wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed horizontal treatment.<ref name="horizontal">Kamath (2001), p134</ref> The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are  horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and ''[[Puranas|puranic]]'' scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of [[Yalli (motif)|yalis]] (or ''makara'', an imaginary beast) and ''hamsas'' (swans). The ''vimana'' (tower) is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.<ref name="yali"> Art critic Percy Brown calls this one of the distinguishing features of Hoysala art (Kamath 2001, p134)</ref>

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Belur sthambha-buttalika.jpg|right|thumb|''Sthamba buttalika'', Chola influence in Hoysala art at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]
[[Image:Belur madanika.jpg|right|thumb|''Madanika'' bracket at [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]]]]
Hoysala artists are famous for their sculptural detail, be it in the depiction of the [[Hindu]] epics, ''[[Yalli (motif)|Yali]]'' (mythical creature), deities, ''[[Kirthimukha]]'' (Gargoyle), eroticism or aspects of daily life. Their medium, the  soft chlorite schist, enabled a virtuoso carving style. Their workmanship shows an attention paid to precise detail. Every aspect down to a finger nail or toe nail is perfected.

[[Salabhanjika]], a common form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian tradition going back to Buddhist sculpture. ''Sala'' is the [[Sal|Sala tree]] and ''bhanjika'' the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, ''madanika'' figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the outer walls of the temple near the roof so worshippers who circumambulate the temple could view them.<ref name="shila">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S|publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu|work=Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 08, April 12 - 25, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> They served the purpose of bracket figures to pillars inside the ''mantapa''. These ''madanika'' were sculptured as seeming engaged in artistic skills such as music (holding musical instruments) and dance. ''Kirthimukhas'' (demon faces) adorn the towers of [[Vimana (tower)|''vimana'']] in some temples. Sometimes the artists left behind their signature on the sculpture they created.

The ''sthamba buttalikas'' are pillar images that show  traces of [[Chola]] art  in the Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have been from Chola country, a result of the expansion of the empire into Tamil speaking regions of Southern India. The image of ''mohini'' on one of the pillars in the ''[[mandapa|mantapa]]'' (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is a fine example of Chola art.<ref name="sthamba">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S|publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu|work=Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 08, April 12 - 25, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref>

General life themes  are portrayed on wall panels such as the way  horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the depiction of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, rows of animals such as lions and elephants  (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.<ref name="ramayana">The epic [[frieze]] is the most exciting feature of their sculptures (Foekema 1996, p29)</ref><ref name="ramayana1">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S|publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu|work=Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 08, April 12 - 25, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> 

Erotica was a subject the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no exhibitionism in this and erotic themes were carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations are associated with the ''Shakta'' practice. The temple doorway is heavily engraved with ornamentation called ''Makaratorana'' (''makara'' or imaginary beast) and each side of the doorway exhibits sculptured ''Salabanjika'' (maidens).

Apart from these sculptures, entire sequences from the [[Hindu]] epics (commonly the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]) have been sculptured in a clockwise direction starting at the main entrance.<ref name="clockwise">Foekema (1996), p29</ref> The right to left sequence is  the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual [[circumambulation]] as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero [[Arjuna]] shooting fish, the elephant headed God [[Ganesha]], the Sun God [[Surya]], the weather and war god [[Indra]], and [[Brahma]] with [[Sarasvati]] are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is [[Durga]], with several arms holding weapons given to her by  other Gods,  in the act of killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and [[Harihara]] (a fusion Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident.

The Shikhara is pyramid shaped and rises in steps without any decoration and has a ''stupika'' or ''kalasha'' on the top (Kamath 2001, p38)</ref> Engrained in the craftsmanship of  Hoysala sculptors was their knowledge of the effect of light and shade on carved walls which they used to maximum effect in their sculptures in the numerous projections and recesses. The Hoysala sculpture in all its richness is said to be a challenge to photography.<ref name="light">{{cite web|title=Hoysala Heritage|url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2008/stories/20030425000206700.htm |author=Settar S|publisher=Frontline, From the publishers of the Hindu|work=Frontline, Volume 20 - Issue 08, April 12 - 25, 2003|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> The art of the Hoysalas on stone is compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewelry worn by the sculpted figures, the variety of hairstyles and head dresses depicted gives a fair idea of the social life styles of the Hoysala times.<ref name"hair">Sastri (1955), p429</ref>

While the Hoysalas had the services of great architects and sculptors, some names stand out in their history. While medieval Indian artists preferred to remain anonymous, Hoysala artists signed their works, which has given researchers fascinating details of their lives, family, guild, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, people of other guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, silversmiths also contributed to the completion of temples. The artists were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included [[Amarashilpi Jakanachari]],<ref name="famous">{{cite web|title=In need of support|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/aug92005/spectrum92548200588.asp|author=Raghavendra, Srinidhi|publisher=Deccan Herald|work=Deccan Herald, Spectrum, Tuesday, August 9, 2005|accessdate=2006-11-13}}</ref> a native of Kaidala in [[Tumkur district]], who also built temples for the [[Western Chalukyas]].
