'''James Albert "Jim" Cutmore''' (28 December 1898 <U+2013> 30 November 1985) was an [[England|English]] [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]]er who spent his entire career with [[Essex County Cricket Club]]. Cutmore was primarily a middle-order batsman who played right-handed, making a total of almost 16,000 runs in 342 first-class matches at an average of 28.61; however, he also bowled on occasion, taking 11 wickets at an average of 62.45.

Cutmore was born in [[Walthamstow]], [[Essex]] (now in the [[London Borough of Waltham Forest]]).He made his Essex debut on 5 July 1924 in a home match against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] in the [[1924 County Championship]]; coming in at number 7, he made 18 runs in the first innings and 29 in the second, as well as taking the second-innings wicket of [[William Abel]] with one of the four balls he bowled in the innings; Surrey won the match by 5 wickets. As his career continued, Cutmore rose up the Essex batting line-up, even opening the innings on occasion; in 1927, he opened the batting in an away match against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] at [[Greenbank, Bristol|Greenbank]] and went on to make his career best score of 238 not out before Essex declared on 578/6. By the end of his career, Cutmore had settled near the top of the middle-order. His final appearance came on 17 June 1936, away to [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]]; with Essex batting second, Cutmore came in at number 3 and made 21 runs before being trapped [[leg before wicket|LBW]] by [[Bill Bowes]]; in the second innings, he opened the batting, but this time made only 13 runs before he was caught by [[Arthur Mitchell (cricketer)|Arthur Mitchell]] off the bowling of [[Hedley Verity]].

Cutmore died in [[Brentwood]], [[Essex]], on 30 November 1985 at the age of 86.
