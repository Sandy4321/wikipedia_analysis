'''Christian Academy of Louisville''', based in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], is the largest [[Protestant]] [[school]] system in the [[United States]], in terms of student population. Three thousand students attend the four campuses in Louisville and Southern [[Indiana]]. The school claims it seeks to provide a "traditional education in a Christ-centered environment", and families seeking admission must have a reference from a [[minister of religion|minister]] certifying that they attend a [[church]] regularly. The school holds accreditation from the [[Association of Christian Schools International]] (ACSI), the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], the Kentucky Non-Public School Commission, the National Council of Private School Accreditation, the State of [[Kentucky]], and the State of [[Indiana]].

==History==
The Christian Academy School System holds a distinctive place among educational institutions in the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Kentuckiana]] area by providing high-quality, Christian education since 1975.

Christian Academy of Louisville was founded in 1976 serving 120 students in grades one through six in classrooms located in two church facilities. In 1977, a middle school was added doubling the enrollment to 240 students. In 1978, with an enrollment of 336 students in grades one through nine, classes were consolidated into one location with the purchase of the Rock Creek Campus in St. Matthews. In 1982, the first senior class graduated with 19 students.

Continued growth led to the building of the English Station Campus, located on 65 acres, which opened in the Fall of 1998. Currently, more than 1,700 students (K-12) attend the English Station Campus with an additional 435 students attending Preschool-5th grade at the Rock Creek Campus.

In the Fall of 2000, two new campuses were added creating the Christian Academy School System. The Southwest Campus, located in Shively, opened serving 76 students in grades K-2.  The Northside Campus, located in [[New Albany, Indiana]], joined the school system serving over 190 students in Preschool through 5th grade.  A third campus, Graceland Christian School, located in New Albany, Indiana, joined the school system in the Fall of 2003 serving over 450 students in grades K-12.

A new 60-acre campus, Christian Academy of Indiana, combining the Graceland and Northside campuses into a single school, opened in the Fall of 2005 serving over 720 students.

Construction of a new building is underway at the Southwest Campus due to an enrollment that has increased to 179 students in Preschool through 7th grade. The new campus is scheduled to open for the 2006-2007 school year.

==Campuses==
The four campuses are located in and around the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Kentuckiana]] area and include the main, English Station campus (pictured), Rock Creek (original) campus, Southwest campus (which is currently under construction), and the [[Indiana]] campus.

==Academics and achievement==
The school regularly produces [[National Merit Scholar|National Merit Finalists]] and Governor's Scholars from its large population of academically dominant students. The graduating class of [[2005]] received over $5 million in [[scholarship]]s. Typically, about ninety-eight percent of Christian Academy graduates go on to [[college]].
