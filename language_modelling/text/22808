The '''culture of Taiwan''' is a [[hybridity|hybrid]] blend of [[Confucianist]] [[Han Chinese]], [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]], [[Culture of Europe|European]], [[Culture of the United States|American]], [[globalization|global]], [[localization|local]] and [[Taiwanese aborigines]] cultures, which are often perceived in both [[tradition]]al and [[modernity|modern]] understandings {{Harvcol|Harrell/Huang|1994|pp=1-5}}. The common socio-political experience in Taiwan gradually developed into a sense of Taiwanese [[cultural identity]] and a feeling of Taiwanese cultural awareness, which has been widely debated domestically (Yip 2004:230-248; Makeham 2005:2-8; Chang 2005:224). Reflecting the continuing controversy surrounding the [[political status of Taiwan]], politics continues to play a role in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially in the prior dominant frame of a [[Taiwanese]] and [[China|Chinese]] dualism. In recent years, the concept of Taiwanese [[multiculturalism]] has been proposed as a relatively apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought and behavior shared by the people of Taiwan{{Harvcol|Hsiau|2005|pp=125-129}}; (Winckler 1994:23-41).

{{main|History of Taiwan}}
===Historical context===
Taiwan<U+2019>s culture and cultural legacy has been largely shaped by the processes of [[imperialism]] and [[colonization]] as the structural and psychological effects of successive colonial projects have been integral to developing Taiwan<U+2019>s self-image and the evolution of both official and unofficial Taiwanese culture {{Harvcol|Yip|2004|pp=2-5}}. For most of its colonized existence, Taiwan remained on the cultural margins, far from the centers of civil and cultural life of each regime, and with every regime change, Taiwan<U+2019>s cultural center shifted. At various times Taiwan<U+2019>s cultural center has been [[Taiwanese Aborigines|Indigenous Taiwan]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Xiamen]] (Amoy), [[Qing]] era [[Beijing]], [[Imperial Japan]], postwar [[China]] and even, arguably, the [[United States]] {{Harvcol|Morris|2004|pp=7-31}};{{Harvcol|Winkler|1994|pp=28-31}}.
[[Image:Taiwan bunun dancer.jpg|thumb|[[Bunun people|Bunun]] dancer in traditional aboriginal dress.]]

Before the [[Qing Empire]] ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895, Taiwan<U+2019>s culture was characterized by Qing frontier societies of [[Han]] farmers and highland [[Taiwanese aborigines|Aborigines]]. Due to Taiwan<U+2019>s strategic location along [[East Asia]]n trade routes, Taiwanese were also exposed to cosmopolitan influences and the effects of European commerce. By the middle of the Japanese era (1895-1945), Taiwan had begun to shift from local to contemporary global culture, under the guidance of Japanese style <U+201C>westernization<U+201D>. Beginning during Japan<U+2019>s build up for war {{Harvcol|Wachman|1994|pp=6-7}}, Japan invigorated its policies to Japanize Taiwan for mobilization against the Allies. Japan<U+2019>s effort taught Taiwan<U+2019>s elite, Japanese culture and language, but did not largely interfere in religious organization. When Japan<U+2019>s suppressive wartime policies were lifted following WWII, Taiwanese were eager to continue with their prewar [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] activities {{Harvcol|Mendel|1970|pp=13-14}}. Japan<U+2019>s colonial legacy has shaped many of the customs and mannerisms of Taiwanese. Japan<U+2019>s colonial legacy is still visible, due to Japan<U+2019>s massive effort in constructing Taiwan<U+2019>s economic infrastructure and industrial base, which is often cited as a major factor in Taiwan<U+2019>s rapid economic development {{Harvcol|Gold|1986|pp=21-32}}

{{main|Taiwan under Japanese rule}}
==KMT Era Cultural Policy==

{{main|History of KMT cultural policy}}
During the early postwar period the [[Chinese Nationalist Party]] <U+201C>Kuomintang<U+201D> (KMT) discouraged Taiwanese from participating in politics and barred Taiwanese from cosmopolitan life except in the spheres of science and technology {{Harvcol|1994|Winckler|p=29}}. The authoritarian [[KMT]] dominated public cultural space and Chinese nationalist networks became a part of cultural institutions, leaving little resource for cultural autonomy to grow {{Harvcol|Phillips|2003|pp=10-15}}. 

Under the early KMT, Taiwan was realigned from a Japanese imperial center to a Chinese nationalist center, under the influence of KMT and American [[geo-political]] interests {{Harvcol|Gold|1994|p=47}}. Although American cultural activities were modest, they played a significant role in Taiwan<U+2019>s developing cultural scene. The KMT claimed a loss of morale led to <U+201C>losing China<U+201D> and thus the state issued a series of ideological reforms aimed to <U+201C>retake" China, which became the major state cultural program or the time, The immediate preoccupation with losing China diverted long term investment in the humanities and social sciences. On another level, the state<U+2019>s main objective was to <U+201C>[[sinicize]]<U+201D> the Taiwanese by teaching them [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Nationalist ideology through compulsory primary education {{Harvcol|Wachman|1994|pp=82-88}}. 

By the late 1940s the KMT had eliminated dissent for its cultural policies. When Taiwanese had resumed the cultural activities, which were outlawed by the Japanese in 1937, the Nationalist attitude was that Taiwanese had been Japanese <U+201C>slaves<U+201D> and would therefore have to complete a period of moral and ideological tutelage before they could enjoy their full rights as citizens of the [[Republic of China]] {{Harvcol|Kerr|1965|pp=72;266}}. The [[February 28 Incident]] destroyed Taiwan<U+2019>s urban elite and the arrival of the mainlander elite ensured Nationalist domination of urban cultural centers {{Harvcol|Gates|1981|pp=266-269}}.  

In 1953, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] issued his first major opinion on culture to complete [[Sun Yat-sen]]<U+2019>s [[Three Principles of the People]], which included prescribing Nationalist curriculum for education, building facilities for intellectual and physical recreation and the major state cultural program of promoting anti-communist propaganda {{Harvcol|Winckler|1994|p=30}}. In regard to Taiwanese cultural life, the major thrust was for <U+201C>universalization<U+201D> of education in Mandarin, which was enforced by law. Despite the hard-line Chinese control over culture, the Soviet advances in technology led to a new Nationalist focus on building closer cooperation with American universities and developing engineering programs {{Harvcol|Wilson|1970|}}. The American presence in Taiwan also encouraged Taiwanese to resume some politically, ethnically neutral cultural activities, which was expressed in a flourishing Taiwanese language media market {{Harvcol|Winckler|1994|p=32}}.

Between the 1960s and the 1980s Taiwan's culture was commonly described in contrasts between Taiwan (Free China) and China (Communist China), often drawing from the official tropes of Taiwan as a bastion of traditional Chinese culture, which had preserved <U+201C>true<U+201D> Chinese values and culture against the <U+201C>false<U+201D> Chinese culture of post Communist China. At the same time, Taiwanese cultural expressions were brutally suppressed by the Chinese Nationalists (KMT). The KMT fostered a myriad of programs designed to promote a Chinese <U+201D>cultural renaissance<U+201D>. These programs involved subsidized publication of [[Chinese Classics]], the symbolic functions of the [[National Palace Museum]], promoting famous prewar scholars to prominent positions in government and academic institutions, textbook and curriculum design with a focus on the official view of <U+201C>traditional<U+201D> Chinese culture and involvement in social and community events and the exemplification of Confucian ideology intertwined with Sun Yat-sen thought{{Harvcol|Chen|2000|pp=11-12}}.

==Taiwanization==
{{main|Taiwanization}}
===After 1975===
[[Bentuhua]] or [[Bentuhua|Taiwanization]]/[[Taiwanese localization]] has become, arguably, the most important symbol of cultural change over the past twenty years. Bentuhua describes the social and cultural movement by the people of Taiwan to identify with Taiwan<U+2019>s unique historical and cultural legacy and, it has been argued, to reject the prior many of the prior symbols of <U+201C>authentic<U+201D> Chineseness the KMT promoted as an authoritarian government. Bentuhua has often been associated with [[Taiwan Independence]] and [[Taiwanese nationalism]].

==Religion==
[[Image:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|Yin and Yang symbol of [[Taoism]].]]
{{main|Religion in Taiwan}}

The prevalent form of religious belief in [[Taiwan]] is a blend of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese folk religion]], including [[ancestor worship]][http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/brief/info04_19.html]. However, there are also large numbers of devotees to each of these belief systems [http://ecommerce.taipeitimes.com/yearbook2004/P351.htm]. [[Confucianism]] remains a major influence on personal philosophy and ethics. The government on Taiwan has continued the tradition of honoring [[Confucius]] and [[Duke Yansheng|his lineal descendants]] [http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/brief/info04_19.html].

Even though small in number, [[Christianity|Christian]] churches have been active in Taiwan for many years, a majority of which are [[Protestant]] (with 2.6% of the population identifying themselves as Protestant [http://ecommerce.taipeitimes.com/yearbook2004/P351.htm]) with [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan|Presbyterians]] playing a particularly significant role. The [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]] has been active in promoting human rights and the use of the [[Taiwanese (linguistics)|Taiwanese]] dialect, both during Japanese rule, as well as the martial law period of the Republic of China, during which the exclusive use of [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]] was legally mandated. As such, the church has been associated with the [[Taiwan Name Rectification Campaign]] and the [[pan-green]] coalition.

A number of Taiwanese religious organizations have extended their operations beyond the country. Several organizations, especially [[Buddha's Light International Association]] and [[Tzu Chi]], have extended their operations around the world. There are frequent contacts between [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]] temples in [[Taiwan]] and those in [[Fujian]] on the [[mainland China|mainland]]. Likewise, there are close contacts between [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] organisations in Taiwan and those on the [[mainland China|mainland]].

According to the [[CIA World Factbook]], buddhist-taoist religious belief makes up 93%, Christian 4.5%, and others 2.5%.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tw.html CIA - The World Factbook -- Taiwan]</ref>

==Food==
[[Image:Pearl Milktea.jpg|thumb|100px|Pearl milk tea]]
{{main|Cuisine of Taiwan}}

Taiwanese cuisine itself is often associated with influences from mid to southern provinces of China, most notably from the province of Fujian (Hokkien), but influences from all of China can easily be found due to the large number of mainland Chinese who immigrated to Taiwan at end of the [[Chinese Civil War]]. A notable Japanese influence exists due to the period when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Traditional Chinese food to be found in Taiwan, alongside Fujian and Hakka-style includes dishes from Guangdong, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hunan, Sichuan and Beijing. Taiwanese culture has also influenced the west: [[Pearl milk tea]] (commonly known as [[bubble tea]]) is a popular [[tea]] drink available in many parts of the world.

==Language==
{{main|Languages of Taiwan}}

Most people in Taiwan speak both [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Taiwanese (linguistics)|Taiwanese]] (a variant [[Min Nan|Minnan dialect]] of southern [[Fujian]]). Mandarin is taught in schools, however most spoken media is split between Mandarin and Taiwanese. Speaking Taiwanese under the [[Taiwan localization movement|localization]] movement has become a way for the pro-independence Taiwanese to distinguish themselves from the [[Mainlander]]. The [[Hakka]], who make about 10 percent of the population, have a distinct [[Hakka (linguistics)|Hakka dialect]]. The [[Taiwanese Aborigines|Aboriginal Taiwanese]] still speak their native languages, but most of them can also speak Mandarin and Taiwanese. English is taught universally, starting with middle school.

Some Japanese words have remained in common day use such as:
* <U+4E00><U+6975><U+68D2> (''yijibang'') from <U+4E00><U+756A> (''ichiban'') which means "the best".
* <U+6B50><U+5DF4><U+6851> (''oubasang'') from <U+304A><U+3070><U+3055><U+3093> or <U+304A><U+3070><U+3042><U+3055><U+3093> (''obasan'' / ''obaasan'') which means "auntie" or "granny". The usage of this term can be offensive to women as it implies their youth has faded or refers to the term [[obatalian]] (an annoying bossy middle-aged woman).
* <U+6B50><U+5409><U+6851> (''oujisang'' from <U+304A><U+3058><U+3055><U+3093> or <U+304A><U+3058><U+3044><U+3055><U+3093> (''ojisan'' / ''ojiisan'') which means "uncle" or "gramps".
* <U+5361><U+62C9>OK (''kala OK'') from <U+30AB><U+30E9><U+30AA><U+30B1> (''karaoke'') which is an amalgamation of "kara (empty) and orchestra". The usage of this term is in decline in favor of "[[KTV]]".

==Media==
{{main|Media of Taiwan}}
Taiwan's [[freedom of press]] is guaranteed by the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitution]] and its [[Worldwide_Press_Freedom_Index#Worldwide_Press_Freedom_Index_Ranking|worldwide press freedom index]] ranks at 32 among 169 nations, as of 2007. Taiwan had been under martial law, with strict restrictions on the press and broadcasting, before political liberalization loosened restrictions in the 1980s. 

==Sports==
{{main|Sport in Taiwan}}
Popular sports in Taiwan include:

*[[Badminton]]
*[[Baseball]]
*[[Basketball]]
*[[Cheerleading]]
*[[Golf]]
*[[Martial arts]]
*[[Billiards|Pool]]
*[[Swimming]]
*[[Table tennis]]
*[[Tennis]]
*[[Volleyball]]

The [[United States]] [[NBA]] has a substantial following in Taiwan. Popular basketballers such as [[Allen Iverson]], [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Chauncey Billups]], [[Andre Iguodala]], [[Jason Williams (basketball)|Jason Williams]] have visited Taiwan.

Athletes from Taiwan compete in international sporting events, often under the banner of "[[Chinese Taipei]]".

==Recreation==
[[Image:Taipei KTV-Eingangshalle.jpg|thumb|200px|Entrance hall of a K-TV in Taipei.]]

[[Karaoke]] is incredibly popular in Taiwan, where it is termed [[KTV]] (Karaoke Television). This is an example of something the Taiwanese have drawn, on scale, from contemporary Japanese culture. [[Pachinko]] is another example. During typhoons, many young Taiwanese will spend the day away singing karaoke or playing [[mahjong]]. Many people enjoy watching [[miniseries]] collectively called [[Taiwanese drama]].

Since 1999 [[Taiwanese hot springs|hot springs]], known as ''w<U+0113>nqu<U+00E1>n'' in Chinese and  ''onsen'' in Japanese, has been making a comeback thanks to efforts by the government. Over 100 hot springs have been discovered since the Japanese introduced their rich onsen culture to Taiwan, with the largest concentration to the northernmost part of Taiwan island.

[[Anime]] and [[manga]], is very popular in Taiwan. Manga are called ''[[Manhua]]'' in Taiwan. It is common to see a manga rental shop or a manga store every couple of streets in larger cities.

==Convenience store culture==
Boasting 8,058 [[convenience stores]] in an area of 35,980 km<U+00B2> and a population of 22.9 million, Taiwan has the [[Asia Pacific]]<U+2019>s and perhaps the world<U+2019>s highest density of convenience stores per person: one store per 2,800 people or .000357 stores per person.<ref>{{cite journal | author = , American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei | authorlink=http://www.amcham.com.tw | title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation | journal=Taiwan Business TOPICS | volume=34 |issue=11| url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558}}</ref>. With 3897 [[7-Eleven]] stores, Taiwan also has the world<U+2019>s highest density of 7-Elevens per person: one store per 6200 people or .000161 stores per person<ref>{{cite web | year=2006| title=International Licensing | work=7-Eleven | url=http://www.7-eleven.com/about/globalsites.asp | accessdate=2006-03-06}}</ref> In Taipei, it is not unusual to see two 7-Elevens across the street or several of them within a few hundred meters of each other.

Because they are found everywhere, convenience stores in Taiwan provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government agencies such as collection of the city parking fee, utility bills, traffic violation fines, and credit card payments. Eighty-one percent of urban household shoppers in Taiwan visit a convenience store each week.<ref>{{cite journal | author = , American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei | authorlink=http://www.amcham.com.tw | title=Convenience Stores Aim at Differentiation | journal=Taiwan Business TOPICS | volume=34 |issue=11| url=http://www.amcham.com.tw/publication_topics_view.php?volume=34&vol_num=11&topics_id=558}}</ref>
The idea of being able to purchase food items, drink, [[fast food]], [[magazines]], videos, [[computer games]], and so on 24 hours a day and at any corner of a street makes life easier for Taiwan<U+2019>s extremely busy and rushed population. 

Convenience stores include:

*[[Circle K]] (Called ''OK'' in Taiwan)
*[[FamilyMart]]
*[[Hi-Life]]
*[[NikoMart]]
*[[7-11]]

[[Image:7 ELEVEn Outles in Sindian.jpg|mid|thumb|200px|Two [[7-Eleven]] stores opposite each other on a crossroad. Taiwan has the highest density of 7-Eleven stores per person in the world.]]

==Cram school culture==
{{main|Education in Taiwan}}

Taiwan, like Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan, and South Korea, is well-known for its buxiban (<U+88DC><U+7FD2><U+73ED>), often translated as [[cram school]], and literally meaning "make-up class" or "catch-up class" or to learn more advanced classes. Nearly all students attend some sort of buxiban, whether for mathematics, computer skills, English, other foreign languages, or exam preparation (college, graduate school, TOEFL, GRE, SAT, etc). This is perpetuated by a [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] culture that measures merit through testing, with entrance into college, graduate school, and government service decided entirely on testing. This has also led to a remarkable respect for degrees, including Ph.D.s and overseas Western degrees (US and Great Britain).

English teaching is a big business in Taiwan, with Taiwan, as part of its project to reinvigorate the [[Taiwan miracle]], aiming to become a trilingual country--fluent in Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English. Many teachers come from English-speaking countries, such as the US, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand, and enjoy salaries of about $30,000-$50,000 per year at a low cost-of-living, with opportunities to manage or open one's own school and make several times that amount a year.

==Popular culture==
[[Cell phones]] are very popular in Taiwan. Mobile penetration rate stands at just over 100%. Because of their high use, phones in Taiwan have many functions and are becoming cheaper.

[[Internet cafe]]s are very popular with teenagers. They often sell food. Many gamers eat while using the [[internet]]. Many parents and teachers are concerned with the amount of time youth spend in the internet cafes.

One of the best known figure in Taiwanese cinema is director [[Ang Lee]], who has also made movies in the West and has won an [[Academy Award]]. Some popular pop artists in Taiwan include [[Jay Chou]], [[Alan Luo]], [[Jolin Tsai]] and [[David Tao]]. Some of them have gained international fame and toured Asian countries like [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Since Taiwan is well known for its entertainment scene, some of its TV station has organised talent search to search for new and young talents to join the big family of pop culture here. Some bands like [[S.H.E]] are formed in the talent search.

[[Hip-hop culture]] from the [[United States]] also flourishes in Taiwan. [[G-Unit]] and [[Eminem]] are also very popular{{Fact|date=August 2008}}. In this process, Taiwan produced several hip-hop artists, including [[Dog G]], [[MC HotDog]], [[Machi (Hip-Hop)|Machi]], and [[L.A. Boyz]]. Many{{Fact|date=August 2008}} young [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] can be seen in [[throwback uniform|throwback jersey]], [[bling-bling]], and baggy jeans which shows the effect of [[hip hop fashion]] in Taiwan.

[[Taiwanization]] of the culture of Taiwan has been a trend since democratisation in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, after half a century of [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party rule, the first ever democratic change of ruling parties in Taiwan occurred with the election of Chen Shui-bian and his [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP), marking an important step towards localisation. While both major political parties, the KMT and the DPP, are generally supportive of localisation, the DPP made localisation a key plank in its political platform. The Chen administration's policies included measures designed to focus on Taiwan while de-emphasizing cultural and historical ties to China.  These policies included changes such as revising textbooks and changing school curricula to focus more on Taiwan's own history to the exclusion of China, and changing the names of institutios that contain "China" to "Taiwan". These policies sometimes led to incongruities such as [[Sun Yat-sen]] being treated as both a "foreign" (Chinese) historical figure and as the "Father of the Country" (Republic of China). These policies are called "localisation" but have been attacked by detractors as "[[desinicization]]".

One phenomenon that has resulted from the localisation movement is the advent of ''Taike'' subculture, in which people consciously adopt the wardrobe, language and cuisine to emphasize the uniqueness of popular, groundroots Taiwanese culture, which in previous times had often been seen as provincial.

The Kuomintang took power in 2008 with the election of [[Ma Ying-jeou]] to the presidency. The new KMT administration has sought to reverse some of the desinicizing policies of the Chen administration, to various degrees of public support. The restoration of the [[Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall]] to its former state has been generally supported. By contrast, a directive by the administration to foreign missions to henceforth refer to visits by foreign dignitaries as "visiting (cultural) [[China]]" has been rescinded after criticism from DPP legislators.
