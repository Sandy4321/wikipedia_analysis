'''Blanche Z<U+00E9>lia Jos<U+00E9>phine Delacroix''', better known as '''Caroline Lacroix''' (13 May 1883 <U+2013> 12 February 1948) was a [[France|French]]-[[Romania|Romanian]] [[prostitute]] well-noted in her lifetime for being the most prominent and notorious of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s mistresses. 

She met the king in [[Paris]] as a young girl, when she was only 16 and he was 65. They soon embarked upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, '''Baroness Vaughan'''. Because of these presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the [[Congo Free State]], his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as '''''la reine du Congo'''''. 

She and Leopold married in a religious ceremony five days before his death, though their failure to perform a [[civil ceremony]] rendered the marriage illegitimate under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income - all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to seize some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 at [[Cambo]], [[France]].

==Early life==
There remains a small degree of mystery concerning Caroline's early life.<ref name=AH221>{{cite book|first=|last=[[Adam Hochschild|Hochschild, Adam]]|title=[[King Leopold's Ghost|King Leopold<U+2019>s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa]]|publisher=[[Mariner Books]]|location=New York|year=1998|isbn=0-330-49233-0|url=|page=221}}</ref> One account states that her father, Jules Delacroix, was a [[janitor]] of the French Legation at [[Bucharest]].<ref name=ti1/> Another states that her father lived in Bucharest to seek his fortune, and she was born there as the thirteenth child of her parents.<ref name=XP285-87/> In her youth, Caroline worked as a [[barmaid]].<ref name=ti1/>

Various sources assert that Caroline was a [[prostitute]] living in [[Paris]].<ref name=E220>{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Ewans|title=European atrocity, African catastrophe: Leopold II, the Congo Free State and its Aftermath|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|location=London|year=2002|isbn=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FAz2vI5Jw2UC&pg=PA220&dq=blanche+delacroix+leopold+ii&hl=en&ei=aoPbTOyUBdKmngf7xIEX&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=delacroix&f=false|page=220}}</ref> As a young woman, she was the mistress of Antoine-Emmanuel Durrieux, a former officer in the French army.<ref name=AH221/> According to [[Adam Hochschild]], Durrieux liked to support the two of them by betting on horse races; when his luck soured, he became a form of [[pimp]], prostituting Caroline to well-born clients.<ref name=AH221/> They undertook their schemes at the [[<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>e Palace]], but frequently left debts unpaid.<ref name=AH221/> One day in 1900, while residing in Paris, [[Leopold II of Belgium]] heard of her "attractions" and felt interested in her modest beginnings.<ref name=XP285-87/> A woman sent by Leopold informed Caroline, "Madame, I am sent to you by a gentleman who has noticed you. He is a very high personage, but his exalted position obliges me to withhold his name".<ref name=AH221/>

A meeting was arranged for the following day; Caroline went to a secluded room, where Leopold arrived with two aides.<ref name=AH221/> As Leopold II was unknown to her, Caroline was so flustered with the encounter that she mixed up [[Belgium]] and [[Sweden]] in the king's presence, referring to him as ''His Majesty Oscar,'' to his surprise and amusement.<ref name=XP285-87/> The two aides' purpose soon became clear: one sat on each side of her and began asking questions that required her to "turn my head first to the right, then to the left... their only aim, as I learned later, being to show off my two profiles to the mute personage", according to her memoirs.<ref name=AH221/> Leopold confessed himself pleased and invited Caroline to [[Austria]] with him; a large sum of money duly arrived the next day, along with some empty trunks, as Leopold was aware that she loved to buy clothes.<ref name=AH222>Hochschild, p. 222.</ref>

As a mere sixteen-year-old (compared with Leopold's age of 65), Caroline's relationship with the old king quickly became public knowledge, causing Leopold to be labeled lecherous and besotted.<ref name=E220/><ref name=AH222/> Though Leopold had previously embarked upon affairs with other mistresses (earning him the nickname ''le roi des Belges et des Belles''),<ref name=AR267/> his affair with Caroline was unique, and the Belgian press in particular enjoyed publishing their affair for countless years.<ref name=MN102/> Her habit of accompanying Leopold to fashionable spas in Europe provoked further disbelief and outrage, with some speculating that she perversely pleasured the old king with the use of strategically placed mirrors and "special" equipment.<ref name=KS268>{{cite book|first=Karl|last=Shaw|title=Royal Babylon: the alarming history of European royalty|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|year=1999|isbn= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aOO601TsAOgC&pg=PA268&dq=caroline+lacroix+king+leopold&hl=en&ei=-GvsTJG9E4KVnAegoIniAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=caroline%20lacroix%20king%20leopold&f=false|page=268}}</ref> The young mistress became known as ''la reine du Congo'' because the great wealth she accumulated from Leopold came from his colony.<ref name=AR267>{{cite book|first=Angelo S.|last=Rappoport|title=Leopold, the Second King of the Belgians|publisher=BiblioLife, LLC|location=|year=2009|isbn= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GKmDCiXe6IMC&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=caroline+lacroix+leopold&source=bl&ots=EleEu7B-H0&sig=qQf1z9e8onfv6KuKkZ-cye-AiY4&hl=en&ei=VKbqTJTzC4iXnAe_ptCaDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=caroline%20lacroix%20leopold&f=false|page=267}}</ref><ref name=nzs/> She became his companion for the last years of his life, as his estranged wife [[Marie Henriette of Austria|Queen Marie Henriette]] died in 1902.<ref name=E220/> Their relationship coincided with Leopold's worsening international reputation, which was the result of his actions and orders concerning the [[Congo Free State]].<ref name=nyt1/> Hochschild writes that their affair ironically lost Leopold more popularity in Belgium than any of his crimes in the Congo; consequently, few of his former allies were willing to defend him once he became the target of the international protest movement led by the [[Congo Reform Association]].<ref name=AH222/> Belgian [[socialists]] in particular used the affair to prove that because Leopold was in his "dotage" and under the control of a "rapacious and ambitious woman", he was unfit to govern.<ref name=nzs/>

[[File:Leopold II of Belgium.jpg|left|thumb|160px|[[Leopold II of Belgium]]]]

After Marie Henriette's death, Leopold's relationship with Caroline became flagrantly open, and he placed her across from his [[Laeken]] mansion, in the ''Villa Vanderborght'', even building a pedestrian bridge so he could see her at will.<ref name=AH222/><ref name=nzs/> The bridge reveals the king's jealousy, although this may have been justified, as her former love Durrieux had been caught with her on several occasions. Caroline tried to pass him off as her brother when Leopold caught the two together; one publication reported that she and Durrieux had placed secret electric bells in all her residences so that servants could warn her when the king was approaching.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 222-23.</ref>

Leopold spent vast sums of money on gifts and estates for his young mistress, presenting for instance the [[Villa Leopolda]] to Caroline in 1902. She frequently traveled to Paris to visit her dress- and hat-maker, once bragging that she spent three million [[francs]] on dresses at a single store on one occasion.<ref name=AH223>Hochschild, p. 223.</ref> Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop, causing Leopold to arrange it so that the train would leave an hour later.<ref name=AH223/> When pregnant with their first child, the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable.<ref name=MN102>{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Nelson|title=Queen Victoria and the discovery of the Riviera|publisher=I.B.

As the years went by and the king became increasingly prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour".<ref>Pakenham, p. 662.</ref> Caroline was described as having been above average in height, "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was "haughty, sharp, irritable" and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure.<ref name=wp3>{{Citation

===Issue===
Caroline and Leopold had two sons together:

* Lucien Philippe Marie Antoine (9 February 1906 <U+2013> 1984), Duke of Tervuren; he married Lucie Gracieuse Mundutey on 1 March 1927.<ref name=FB>{{cite web

* Philippe Henri Marie Fran<U+00E7>ois (16 October 1907 <U+2013> 21 August 1914), Count of Ravenstein; died young.<ref name=FB/>

Like Caroline herself (who was created '''Baroness Vaughan''' upon the birth of their first son), the two boys were granted courtesy titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary.<ref name=FB/><ref name=wp1/><ref name=AH224>Hochschild, p. 224.</ref> Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate.<ref name=wp1/> Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made.<ref name=wp1/> Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne.<ref name=nzs>{{Citation

==Later years==
Leopold gave his mistress vast sums of money by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit.<ref name=wp1/> He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death.<ref name=nyt2/> Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless of the contents of his will.<ref name=nyt2/> However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or in the shape of paintings, [[bric-a-brac]], and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash.<ref name=nyt2/> Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million [[francs]] he had previously presented her.<ref name=AH266/> Princess Louise Marie soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.<ref name=AH266/> 

The exact degree of Caroline's wealth was always problematic to trace, as the king had placed so much of it in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death.<ref name=wp7>{{Citation

===Legal suits===
[[File:Stephanie louise.jpg|right|thumb|210px|Princesses St<U+00E9>phanie and Louise Marie, who attempted to gain back their father's wealth from Caroline.]]

The old king's estrangement from his three daughters from his first marriage (Princesses Louise Marie, St<U+00E9>phanie, and Cl<U+00E9>mentine) spurred Leopold to keep or give as much wealth away as possible in order to disinherit the girls.<ref name=wp1/> An [[Austria|Austrian]] newspaper claimed that right before he died, Leopold personally gave Caroline his large collection of personal letters as well as documents detailing information about various European royal figures, which greatly worried his eldest daughter.<ref>Wheeler, p. 140.</ref> After his death, the three princesses sued his estate for several million [[francs]], although this was only a very small portion compared with the fortune he accumulated.<ref name=wp1/> The fortune was so large that the princesses were still attempting to recover some of Caroline's wealth four years after their father's death, claiming that Caroline and Durrieux had speedily ransacked one of Leopold's properties in Paris and seized important financial documents before the Belgian envoy to France appeared.<ref name=wp4/><ref name=wp5>{{Citation

===Second marriage, divorce and death===
An extremely rich widow (Leopold's gifts left her a multimillionaire), Caroline continued to appear in newspapers long after Leopold's death. She married Antoine Durrieux, her former love and longtime friend, in 1910, seven months after the king's death.<ref name=wp4>{{Citation
