'''Assyriology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|<U+1F08><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+1FB1>}}, ''Assyri<U+0101>''; and {{lang|grc|-<U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03B3><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is the archaeological, historical, and linguistic study of ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and the related cultures that used [[cuneiform writing]]. The field covers not just [[Assyria]] but also that nation's eventual conqueror, [[Babylonia]], together with the predecessor of both civilizations, [[Sumer]]. The large number of cuneiform clay tablets preserved by these cultures provide an enormous resource for the study of the period.  The region's (and the world's) first cities such as [[Ur]] are archaeologically invaluable for studying the growth of urbanization.

As an academic discipline, Assyriology presents itself as one of the most demanding fields in the humanities. Scholars need a good knowledge of several [[Semitic languages]] (including [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and its major dialects, aided by such languages as [[Biblical Hebrew]] for comparative purposes), and the capacity to absorb the complexities of writing systems with several hundred core signs.  While there now exist many important grammatical studies and lexical aids, many texts remain difficult to interpret accurately. Frequently, this is because the tablets they were written on are broken, or in the case of literary texts, where there may be many copies, the language and grammar are arcane. Moreover, scholars must be able to read and understand modern English, [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]], as important references, dictionaries, and journals are published in those languages.

There are many dialects of Akkadian, the language of Assyria and Babylonia, ranging from the earliest texts in Old Akkadian and related [[Eblaite]] in the [[3rd millennium BC]] down to texts written in the first century AD.  Some dialects are indigenous, for example, the Old Assyrian found in merchant texts from [[Anatolia]], while others appear to be specific 'inventions' of certain groups of literati or religious authorities (the Hymnic Epic dialect, and later, Standard Babylonian).  

The writing system is based upon that which was developed in southern Mesopotamia for the [[Sumerian language]]. Sumerian has no known [[cognate]]s and utilizes an entirely different grammatical system. Despite this difference, the adaptation of the writing system, together with many lexical items as well as possible influence on Akkadian grammar, make reading any Akkadian text a challenging task.

The writing system was also adapted for other languages, including [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Hurrian]], and [[Ugaritic]].  A related cuneiform writing system also appeared for [[Elamite]].

The categories of literature which exist are enormous, including documents such as business and legal records, religious texts, canonical literary texts (for example, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]), historical inscriptions of rulers, personal letters, as well as music, mathematical. and pseudo-scientific texts (omen series).  There are lexical series of a type which reflect a scholarly interest in comparative linguistics, including the  preservation of knowledge of the Sumerian language for religious and cultural purposes. In fact, because cuneiform was used for close to 3000 years, the range of records is as naturally diverse as that found in writing today, notwithstanding lower literacy rates in antiquity. 

The 'creation' of the history of Mesopotamian culture is thus heavily filtered by the technical skills required to adequately understand 'what the text means'. It has also been traditionally close to Biblical studies, though this is less so today.  However, the training of Assyriologists has followed a traditional historical-[[philology|philological]] path - in fact, a PhD apprenticeship, with less attention paid to questions around the philosophy of history, comparative anthropology, or other fields, which in easier circumstances, might be easier to incorporate in both training and publications. 

Few universities teach advanced Assyriology, and not many teach, for example, introductory Akkadian, which at least provides some orientation to the language and culture of the Ancient Near East. 
In the United States these include [[Brandeis University]], [[Brown University]], [[Hebrew Union College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Harvard University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of Chicago]], the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (which also includes a large Mesopotamian, Middle and Near Eastern collection in the University's [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology|Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]), and [[Yale University]].

However, there are important international projects online which are publishing photos, sign-copies and various editions of text, such as:

==History of the field==

For many centuries knowledge of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]] was largely confined to the often dubious classical sources. See also [[Classical authorities of Babylonia and Assyria]].

The excavations of [[P.E. Botta]] at Khorsabad and [[Sir Austen Henry Layard|Austen H. Layard]] (from 1845) at Nimrud and [[Nineveh]], as well as the successful [[decipherment]] of the [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] system of writing opened up a new world. Layard's discovery of the library of [[Assur-bani-pal]] put the materials for reconstructing the ancient life and history of [[Assyria]] and [[Babylon]]ia into the hands of scholars. He also was the first to excavate in Babylonia, where [[C.J. Rich]] had already done useful topographical work. Layard's excavations in this latter country were continued by [[W.K. Loftus]], who also opened trenches at [[Susa]], as well as by [[Julius Oppert]] on behalf of the French government. But it was only in the last quarter of the 19th century that anything like systematic exploration was attempted.

After the death of [[George Smith (Assyriologist)|George Smith]] at [[Aleppo]] in 1876, an expedition was sent by the [[British Museum]] (1877 - 1879), under the conduct of [[Hormuzd Rassam]], to continue his work at Nineveh and its neighbourhood. Excavations in the mounds of Balaw~t, called [[Imgur-Bel]] by the Assyrians, 15 miles east of [[Mosul]], resulted in the discovery of a small temple dedicated to the god of dreams by [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883 BC), containing a stone [[coffer]] or ark in which were two inscribed tables of [[alabaster]] of rectangular shape, as well as of a palace which had been destroyed by the Babylonians but restored by [[Shalmaneser III]] (858 BC). From the latter came the bronze gates with hammered reliefs, which are now in the British Museum.

The remains of a palace of [[Ashurbanipal]] at [[Nimrud]] (Calah) were also excavated, and hundreds of enamelled tiles were disinterred. Two years later (1880-1881) Rassam was sent to Babylonia, where he discovered the site of the temple of the sun-god of [[Sippara]] at [[Abu-Habba]], and so fixed the position of the two Sipparas or Sepharvaim. Abu-Habba lies south-west of [[Baghdad]], midway between the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]], on the south side of a canal, which may once have represented the main stream of the Euphrates, Sippara of the goddess Anunit, now Dir, being on its opposite bank.

Meanwhile (1877 - 1881) the French consul [[Ernest de Sarzec]] had been excavating at [[Telloh]], the ancient [[Lagash]], and bringing to light monuments of the pre-Semitic age, which included the diorite statues of Gudea now in the [[Louvre]], the stone of which, according to the inscriptions upon them, had been brought from [[Magan]], the [[Sinai peninsula]]. The subsequent excavations of de Sarzec in Telloh and its neighbourhood carried the history of the city back to at least 4000 BC, and a collection. of more than 30,000 tablets has been found, which were arranged on shelves in the time of Gudea (c. 2100 BC).

In 1886-1887 a German expedition under Dr [[Robert Koldewey]] explored the cemetery of El Hiba (immediately to the south of Telloh), and for the first time made us acquainted with the burial customs of ancient Babylonia. Another German expedition, on a large scale, was despatched by the ''Orientgesellschaft'' in 1899 with the object of exploring the ruins of Babylon; the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadrezzar]] and the great processional road were laid bare, and Dr W. Andrae subsequently conducted excavations at Qal'at Sherqat, the site of [[Assur]].

Even the Turkish government has not held aloof from the work of exploration, and the Museum at [[Constantinople]] is filled with the tablets discovered by [[V. Scheil]] in 1897 on the site of Sippara. [[Jacques de Morgan]]'s exceptionally important work at [[Susa]] lies outside the limits of Babylonia; not so, however, the American excavations (1903-1904) under EJ Banks at [[Bismaya]] (Ijdab), and those of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] at [[Nippur]] between 1889 and 1900, where Mr JH Haynes has systematically and patiently uncovered the remains of the great temple of [[Enlil|El-lil]], removing layer after layer of debris and cutting sections in the ruins down to the virgin soil. Midway in the mound is a platform of large bricks stamped with the names of [[Sargon of Akkad]] and his son, Naram-Sin (2300 BC); as the debris above them is 34 feet thick, the topmost stratum being not later than the [[Parthia]]n era (HV Hilprecht, ''The Babylonian Expedition'', p.23), it is calculated that the debris underneath the pavement, 30 feet thick, must represent a period of about 3000 years, more especially as older constructions had to be leveled before the pavement was laid. In the deepest part of the excavations, however, inscribed clay tablets and fragments of stone vases are still found, though the cuneiform characters upon them are of a very archaic type, and sometimes even retain their primitive pictorial forms.
