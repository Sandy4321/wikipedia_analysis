'''Fortuna''' (equivalent to the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] goddess [[Tyche]]) was the goddess of fortune and [[personification]] of [[luck]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. She might bring good luck or bad: she could be represented as veiled and blind, as in modern depictions of [[Justice]], and came to represent life's capriciousness. She was also a goddess of [[Destiny|fate]]: as ''Atrox Fortuna'', she claimed the young lives of the [[princeps]] [[Augustus]]' grandsons [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], prospective heirs to the Empire.<ref>Marguerite Kretschmer, "Atrox Fortuna" ''The Classical Journal'' '''22'''.4 (January 1927), 267 - 275.</ref>

Her father was said to be Jupiter and like him, she could also be bountiful (''[[Copia]]''). As ''[[Annonaria]]'' she protected grain supplies. June 11 was sacred to her: on June 24 she was given cult at the festival of ''[[Fors Fortuna]]''.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Fors_Fortuna.html Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,''; (London: Oxford University Press) 1929: on-line text].</ref><ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Fasti]]'' VI. 773<U+2011>786.</ref>

==Cult==
[[File:TomisFortuna2.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Fortuna and Pontos]]
Fortuna's Roman cult was variously attributed to [[Servius Tullius]] &ndash; whose exceptional good fortune suggested their sexual intimacy<ref>[[Varro]], ''De Lingua Latina'' VI.17.</ref> &ndash; and to [[Ancus Marcius]].<ref>[[Plutarch]]; see [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Fors_Fortuna.html Samuel Ball Platner and Thomas Ashby, ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome,''; (London: Oxford University Press) 1929: on-line text].</ref> The two earliest temples mentioned in Roman Calendars were outside the city, on the right bank of the Tiber (in Italian [[Trastevere]]). The first temple dedicated to Fors was attributed to the Etruscan [[Servius Tullius]], while the second is known to have been built in 293 BC as the fullfilment of a Roman promise made during later Etruscan wars<ref>Livy, 'Ad Urbem Condita', 2.40.</ref> The date of dedication of her temples was 24 June, or Midsummer<U+2019>s Day, when celebrants from Rome annually floated to the temples downstream from the city. After undisclosed rituals they then rowed back, garlanded and inebriated.<ref>Billington, S., Green, M. 'The Concept of the Goddess' (London, New York, 1996), 133-134.</ref> Also Fortuna had a temple at the [[Forum Boarium]]. Here Fortuna was twinned with the cult of [[Mater Matuta]] (the goddesses shared a festival on 11 June), and the paired temples have been revealed in the excavation beside the church of [[Sant'Omobono]]: the cults are indeed archaic in date.<ref>Hornblower, S., Spawforth, A., 'The Oxford Classical Dictionary' (Oxford, New York), 606.</ref> Fortuna Primigenia of [[Praeneste]] was adopted by Romans at the end of 3rd BC in an important cult of ''Fortuna Publica Populi Romani'' (the ''Official Good Luck of the Roman People'') on the [[Quirinalis]] outside the [[Porta Collina]].<ref>Hornblower, S., Spawforth, A. 'The Oxford Classical Dictionary' (Oxford, New York), 606.</ref> No temple at Rome, however, rivalled the magnificence of the Praenestine sanctuary.

Fortuna's identity as personification of chance events was closely tied to ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'' (strength of character). Public officials who lacked virtues invited ill-fortune on themselves and Rome: [[Sallust]] uses the infamous [[Catiline]] as illustration &ndash; "Truly, when in the place of work, idleness, in place of the [[Temperance (virtue)|spirit of measure and equity]], caprice and pride invade, fortune is changed just as with morality".<ref>''Verum ubi pro labore desidia, pro continentia et aequitate lubido atque superbia invasere, fortuna simul cum moribus immutatur'', Sallust, ''Catilina'', ii.5. His view of ''fortuna'' is discussed in Etienne Tiffou, "Salluste et la Fortuna", ''Phoenix'',  31.4 (Winter 1977), 349 - 360.</ref>  

An [[oracle]] at the [[Palestrina#Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia|Temple of Fortuna Primigena]] in [[Praeneste]] used a form of divination in which a small boy picked out one of various futures that were written on [[oak]] rods. Cults to Fortuna in her many forms are attested throughout the Roman world. Dedications have been found to ''Fortuna Dubia'' (doubtful fortune), ''Fortuna Brevis'' (fickle or wayward fortune) and ''Fortuna Mala'' (bad fortune).  

She is found in a variety of domestic and personal contexts. During the early Empire, an amulet from the [[House of Menander]] in [[Pompeii]] links her to the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]], as Isis-Fortuna.<ref>Allison, P., 2006, ''The Insula of Menander at Pompeii'': Vol.III, The Finds; A Contextual Study, Oxford: Clarendon Press</ref> She is functionally related to the God [[Bonus Eventus]],<ref>Greene, E.M., <U+201C>The Intaglios<U+201D>, in Birley, A. and Blake, J., 2005, Vindolanda: The Excavations of 2003-2004, Bardon Mill: Vindolanda Trust, pp187-193</ref> who is often represented as her counterpart: both appear on [[amulet]]s and intaglio [[engraved gem]]s across the Roman world.

Her name seems to derive from ''Vortumna'' (she who revolves the year): the earliest reference to [[the Wheel of Fortune]], emblematic of the endless changes in life between prosperity and disaster, is 55 BCE.<ref>Cicero, ''In Pisonem''.</ref> In [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s tragedy ''Agamemnon'', a chorus addresses Fortuna in terms that would remain almost proverbial, and in a high heroic ranting mode that Renaissance writers would emulate: 
{{quote|"O Fortune, who dost bestow the throne<U+2019>s high boon with mocking hand, in dangerous and doubtful state thou settest the too exalted. Never have sceptres obtained calm peace or certain tenure; care on care weighs them down, and ever do fresh storms vex their souls. ...great kingdoms sink of their own weight, and Fortune gives way <U+2018>neath the burden of herself. Sails swollen with favouring breezes fear blasts too strongly theirs; the tower which rears its head to the very clouds is beaten by rainy [[Anemoi|Auster]].... Whatever Fortune has raised on high, she lifts but to bring low. Modest estate has longer life; then happy he whoe<U+2019>er, content with the common lot, with safe breeze hugs the shore, and, fearing to trust his skiff to the wider sea, with unambitious oar keeps close to land."<ref>''Agamemnon'', translation by Frank Justus Miller ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/SenecaAgamemnon.html on-line text])</ref>}}

[[Ovid]]'s description is typical of Roman representations: in a letter from exile<ref>Ovid, ''Ex Ponto'', iv, epistle 3.</ref> he reflects ruefully on the "goddess who admits by her unsteady wheel her own fickleness; she always has its apex beneath her swaying foot."

[[Image:HumiliationValerianusHolbein.jpg|right|thumb|The humiliation of [[Valerian (emperor)|Emperor Valerian]] by king [[Shapur I of Persia]] (260) passed into [[Europe]]an cultural memory as an instance of the reversals of ''Fortuna''. In [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'s pen-and-ink drawing (1521), the universal lesson is brought home by its contemporary setting.]]
Fortuna did not disappear from the popular imagination with the ascendancy of Christianity by any means.<ref>Howard R. Patch, ''The Goddess Fortuna in Medieval Literature'', 1927 is the basic study.</ref> [[Saint Augustine]] took a stand against her continuing presence, in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'': "How, therefore, is she good, who without discernment comes to both the good and to the bad? ...It profits one nothing to worship her if she is truly ''fortune''... let the bad worship her...this supposed deity".<ref>Augustine, ''City of God'', iv.18-18; v.8.</ref> In the 6th century, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'', by statesman and philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], written while he faced execution, reflected the Christian theology of ''casus'', that the apparently random and often ruinous turns of Fortune's Wheel are in fact both inevitable and providential, that even the most coincidental events are part of God's hidden plan which one should not resist or try to change. Fortuna, then, was a servant of God,<ref>Selma Pfeiffenberger, "Notes on the Iconology of Donatello's Judgment of Pilate at San Lorenzo" ''Renaissance Quarterly'' '''20'''.4 (Winter 1967:437-454) p 440.</ref> and events, individual decisions, the [[Astrology|influence of the stars]] were all merely vehicles of Divine Will.  In succeeding generations Boethius' ''Consolation'' was required reading for scholars and students. Fortune crept back in to popular acceptance, with a new iconographic trait, "two-faced Fortune", ''Fortuna bifrons''; such depictions continue into the 15th century.<ref>As Pfeiffenberger observes, citing A. Laborde, ''Les manuscrits <U+00E0> peintures de la Cit<U+00E9> de Dieu'', Paris, 1909: vol. III, pls 59, 65; Pfeiffenberger notes that there are no depictions of a ''Fortuna bifrons'' in Roman art.</ref>

[[Image:ADurerFortunaengraving.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer]]'s engraving of ''Fortuna'', ca 1502]]

The ubiquitous image of [[the Wheel of Fortune]] found throughout the Middle Ages and beyond was a direct legacy of the second book of Boethius's ''Consolation''. The Wheel appears in many renditions from tiny miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscripts]] to huge stained glass windows in cathedrals, such as at [[Amiens]]. Lady Fortune is usually represented as larger than life to underscore her importance. The wheel characteristically has four shelves, or stages of life, with four human figures, usually labeled on the left ''regnabo'' (I shall reign), on the top ''regno'' (I reign) and is usually crowned, descending on the right ''regnavi'' (I have reigned) and the lowly figure on the bottom is marked ''sum sine regno'' (I have no kingdom). Medieval representations of Fortune emphasize her duality and instability, such as two faces side by side like [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]]; one face smiling the other frowning; half the face white the other black; she may be blindfolded but without scales, blind to justice. She was associated with the [[cornucopia]], ship's rudder, the ball and the wheel. The cornucopia is where plenty flows from, the Helmsman's rudder steers fate, the globe symbolizes chance (who gets good or bad luck), and the wheel symbolizes that luck, good or bad, never lasts.
[[File:Allegory of Fortune mg 0010.jpg|thumb|upright|Fortuna lightly balances the [[Globus cruciger|orb]] of sovereignty between thumb and finger in a Dutch painting of ''ca'' 1530 ([[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg]])]]
Fortune would have many influences in cultural works throughout the Middle Ages. In ''[[Le Roman de la Rose]]'', Fortune frustrates the hopes of a lover who has been helped by a personified character "Reason". In Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy#Inferno|Inferno]]'' (vii.67-96) [[Virgil]] explains the nature of Fortune, both a devil and a ministring angel, subservient to God. [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''De Casibus Virorum Illustrium'' ("The Fortunes of Famous Men"), used by [[John Lydgate]] to compose his ''[[Fall of Princes]]'', tells of many where the turn of Fortune's wheel brought those most high to disaster, and Boccaccio essay ''De remedii dell'una e dell'altra Fortuna'', depends upon Boethius for the double nature of Fortuna. Fortune makes her appearance in ''[[Carmina Burana]]'' (see image). The Christianized Lady Fortune is not autonomous: illustrations for Boccaccio's ''Remedii'' show Fortuna enthroned in a triumphal car with reins that lead to heaven,<ref>Noted by Pfeiffenberger 1967:441.</ref> and appears in chapter 25 of Machiavelli's ''[[The Prince]]'', in which he says Fortune only rules one half of men's fate, the other half being of their own will. Machiavelli reminds the reader that Fortune is a woman, that she favours a strong, or even violent hand, and that she favours the more aggressive and bold young man than a timid elder. Even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] was no stranger to Lady Fortune:

:''When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes''
:''I all alone beweep my outcast state ...'' <U+2014> [[Sonnet 29]]

== Pars Fortuna in Astrology ==
[[Image:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|thumb|left|llustration by Al-Biruni (973-1048) of different phases of the moon, from the Persian ''Kitab al-tafhim'']]

In [[Astrology]] the term <U+2018>Pars Fortuna<U+2019> represents a mathematical point in the [[zodiac]] derived by the longitudinal positions of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Ascendant]] (Rising sign) in the birth chart of an individual. It represents an especially beneficial point in the horoscopic chart. In [[Arabic]] [[Astrology]], this point is called [[Arabian Parts]].<ref>[http://www.cafeastrology.com/partoffortune.html -Part of Fortune]; [http://www.skyscript.co.uk/fortune.html David Plant, "Fortune, Spirit and the Lunation Cycle"]</ref> 
 
The procedure followed for fixing one<U+2019>s ''Pars Fortuna'' in ancient and traditional astrology depended on the time of birth, viz., during daylight or night time (whether the Sun was above or below the [[horizon]]). In modern [[western astrology]] the day time formula only was used for many years, but with more knowledge of ancient astrology, the two calculation methods are now often used.

The formula for calculating the day time Part of Fortune (PF) is (using the 360 degree positions for each point): 

PF = Ascendant + [[Moon]] - [[Sun]]

The formula for the night-time Part of Fortune is PF = Ascendant + Sun - Moon

Each calculation method results in a different [[zodiac]] position for the [[Arabian Parts|Part of Fortune]].<ref>[http://www.skyscript.co.uk/fortune.html David Plant, ''op. cit.''].</ref> 

[[Al Biruni]] (973 <U+2013> 1048), an 11th-century mathematician, astronomer and scholar, who was the greatest proponent  of this system of prediction, listed a total of 97 Arabic Parts, which were widely used for astrological consultations. Paul Vachier has prepared an Arabic Parts Calculator for all the Arabic Parts.<ref>[http://www.noendpress.com/pvachier/arabicparts/index.php Paul Vachier, "Arabic Parts"].</ref>
