The '''Schuylkill Canal''' was an interconnected series of [[canal]] reaches and slack water pools along the [[Schuylkill River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]].  Also referred to as the '''Schuylkill Navigation''' for the company that built it, the canal system opened in [[1825]].  At the time, the river was the cheapest and most efficient method of transporting bulk cargo. As a result of this improved transportation, [[anthracite]] [[coal]]-mining grew as the major source of industry between [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania|Pottsville]] and Eastern markets. Mules pulled barges of coal from [[Port Carbon, Pennsylvania|Port Carbon]] to Pottsville; to the ports of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]; and, continuing through additional waterways, to [[New York City]] markets.  

The canal eventually declined due to the rise of the [[rail road]], and was almost completely filled in the 1950s.  The two remaining watered reaches are now used for recreation.

== History ==
[[Image:Canals USA 1825.png|thumb|right|Schuylkill Canal (starting at Philadelphia) with other US canals of 1825]]
The Schuylkill Navigation Company was chartered in 1815 to build a series of navigation improvements in the Schuylkill River. A waterway of {{convert|108|mi|km|0}} was completed in 1827 linking [[Philadelphia]] to [[Port Carbon, Pennsylvania|Port Carbon]] in the anthracite coal fields or the [[Coal Region]] of Pottsville. Combining {{convert|62|mi|km|0|}} of separate canals, often referred to as "reaches", with {{convert|46|mi|km|0}} of slack water pools, the Schuylkill Navigation used 92 lift locks to overcome a difference of {{convert|588|ft|m|0}} in elevation between its terminal points. The [[Union Canal (Pennsylvania)|Union Canal]], built between 1821 and 1828, connected with the Schuylkill Canal at [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]; the two canals combined to make a water link between Philadelphia and the Susquehanna River at [[Middletown, Pennsylvania|Middletown]]. This route competed with and became secondary to the east<U+2013>west divisions of the [[Pennsylvania Canal]] on the [[Main Line of Public Works]] between Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh. The Schuylkill Canal also featured the first transportation tunnel in [[United States|America]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.web-savvy.com/river/schuylkill/transportation.html |title= The Schuylkill and Transportation |accessdate= 2008-01-13}}</ref>  The [[Auburn Tunnel]], a 450 foot (137 m) bore through a hill near [[Auburn, Pennsylvania|Auburn]], was completed in 1821, but due to increased traffic, canal modifications turned it into an [[Cutting (transportation)|open cut]] by 1857.<ref name="ACS">{{cite web |url= http://www.americancanals.org/Pennsylvania/Auburn%20Tunnel.pdf |title= American Canal Society Canal Structure Inventory - Auburn Tunnel |accessdate= 2008-11-29 }}</ref> 

Due to its ability to transport bulk cargoes and provide water power, the Schuylkill Navigation transformed the towns of [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], and Pottsville into early manufacturing centers. By using the [[Delaware River]] and the Delaware and Raritan Canal, manufactured products and [[anthracite]] from the Schuylkill Valley could also reach [[New York Harbor]]. The Schuylkill Navigation system quickly assumed a [[monopoly]] position in the transportation of anthracite coal from the coal mines of [[Schuylkill County]] to Philadelphia. By 1841 the Schuylkill Navigation was annually transporting over 737,517 tons of cargo. However, in 1841 the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] was completed as a competing means of transporting coal from the Schuylkill anthracite fields to Philadelphia. A rivalry between these two forms of transportation soon developed. 

=== Competition with the railroad ===
By 1845 the railroad was able to haul three times as much anthracite to Philadelphia each year as the Schuylkill Navigation. To counter this threat, the Schuylkill Navigation Company began a major expansion program. By 1847 the canals had been enlarged to allow the passage of boats carrying 230 tons of [[coal]]. In 1850 a price fixing arrangement with the railroad stabilized prices for the transportation of anthracite. This decade was the Schuylkill Navigation's most prosperous period, transporting 1,700,000 tons of cargo during the peak year of 1859. However, in that same year the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] carried over 2,500,000 tons.

=== Decline ===
During the 1860s the canal entered a period of decline. In 1869 it was damaged by a flood. Surrendering to the competition in 1870, the Schuylkill Navigation Company leased its waterway to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad for a period of 979 years. Under the railroad's control, the Schuylkill Navigation continued to decline. Since the Delaware and Raritan Canal was owned by the competing [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], Schuylkill boats were denied access to this important [[New Jersey]] waterway. As a result, traffic on the Schuylkill decreased rapidly. By 1890 only 144,994 tons of cargo passed through the Schuylkill Navigation. The Schuylkill Navigation was also greatly hindered by the problems of coal silt deposits which made its upper sections almost unusable. By 1891 the portion of Navigation above [[Port Clinton, Pennsylvania|Port Clinton]] was abandoned. By 1904 the anthracite traffic had almost completely ceased, and after 1913 only an occasional cargo passed between Port Clinton and Philadelphia. Excursion vessels and pleasure boating remained active on the Schuylkill Navigation until much of the waterway was destroyed by the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] during 1947<U+2013>1979 in efforts to remove coal [[silt]] from the Schuylkill River.

== Chester County Canal ==
The '''Chester County Canal''' was an extension of the Schuylkill Canal built by the Schuylkill Navigation Company in 1828 to provide water power to a new nail works in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]].  The new canal connected the slackwater pool of the Schuylkill Canal above the [[Black Rock Dam (Schuylkill River)|Black Rock Dam]] to Phoenixville.  This canal paralleled the top end of the Oakes Reach, on the opposite side or the river.  While the Chester County Canal was initially built to provide water power to the mill, in 1847 it carried scheduled passenger service between Phoenixville and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Annals of Phoenixville and Its Vicinity: From the Settlement to the Year 1871 |last= Pennypacker |first= Samuel Whitaker |authorlink= Samuel W. Pennypacker |coauthors= |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=pfcMAAAAYAAJ |year= 1872 |publisher= Bavis & Pennypacker, printers |location= [[Philadelphia]] |isbn= |page= 176}}</ref>  The spring [[freshet]] of 1869 destroyed the mill "and very much injured the canal and its locks."<ref>Pennypacker, p. 168</ref>

== Present day canal ==

There are two watered stretches of the canal still in existence.  Some {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}} of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|1}} long Oakes Reach between [[Oaks, Pennsylvania|Oaks]] and [[Mont Clare, Pennsylvania|Mont Clare]] and a {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} stretch in [[Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Manayunk]].

=== Oakes Reach ===
The head of the Oakes Reach is at the [[Black Rock Dam (Schuylkill River)|Black Rock Dam]] (Dam #26), near Mont Clare.  The canal passes through the dam structure at Lock #60.  The volunteer [[Schuylkill Canal Association]] has restored Lock 60 to operating condition [http://www.schuylkillcanal.com/restoration/index.html].  The nearby locktender's house has also been restored [http://www.schuylkillcanal.com/about/lockhouse.html].  The Reach runs under [[Pennsylvania Route 29]] in Mont Clare, directly across the river from [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania|Phoenixville]], then through Port Providence.  An [[impounding basin]] from the silt removal project cuts the canal after Longford Road and the final mile of the Reach, has been filled in.  An old stone [[aqueduct]], that carried the Canal over Crossman's Run, and the Locktender's House are still existent; but Lock 61, Brower's Lock, was filled in.  

This reach is named for [[Thomas Oakes (engineer)|Thomas Oakes]], chief engineer of the Schuylkill Navigation Company. The Oakes Reach canal, locks, locktenders' houses, Black Rock Dam, and the slackwater pool extending up to the [[Pennsylvania Route 113]] bridge form the "Schuylkill Navigation Canal, Oakes Reach Section" [[historic district (United States)|historic district]].

=== Manayunk Reach ===
The head of the Manayunk Reach is at the [[Flat Rock Dam]] (Dam #31), near [[Shawmont, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Shawmont]].  The canal passes through the dam structure at Lock #68.  This stretch of canal forms the northern side of [[Venice Island (Pennsylvania)|Venice Island]], which is facing develoment pressures.  At the downstream end of this reach, the canal runs through Manayunk and returns to the river via Locks 69 & 70.  All three lock structures still exist.

* Lock 68 {{Coord|40|02|17|N|75|14|40|W|type:landmark_region:US_scale:1000|display=inline}}
* Locks 69&70 {{Coord|40|01|21|N|75|13|11|W|type:landmark_region:US_scale:1000|display=inline}}

=== Schuylkill River Trail ===
The [[Schuylkill River Trail]] (SRT) now overlays portions of the canal route.  In Manayunk, the Trail uses the canal towpath.

In 2008 the  extension of the Schuylkill River Trail from the [[Perkiomen Creek]] to Longford Road in Oaks opened.  This length of the Trail makes use of the general course of the filled portion of the Oakes Reach and originally used the old canal aqueduct to cross Crossman's Run.  On [[14 February]] [[2008]], a meeting was held to announce the survey work for the extension of the Schuylkill River Trail along the towpath of the watered portion of the Oakes Reach.  It is expected that the towpath restoration itself will commence around March 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://trails.montcopa.org/trails/cwp/view,a,1454,q,62259.asp |title= Schuylkill Canal Towpath Restoration Project |accessdate= 2008-03-15 }}</ref>
