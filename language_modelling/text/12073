'''Heinz Field''' is a [[stadium]] located in the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It primarily serves as the home to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[University of Pittsburgh]] [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Panthers]] [[American football]] teams, members of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) respectively. The stadium opened in 2001, after the [[building implosion|controlled implosion]] of the teams' previous stadium, [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The stadium is named for locally-based [[H. J. Heinz Company]], which purchased the [[naming rights]] in 2001. It hosted the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]] between the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] and [[Washington Capitals]] on January 1, 2011.

Funded in conjunction with [[PNC Park]] and the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]], the $281 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|281|2001|r=1}}}} million today) stadium stands along the [[Ohio River]], on the [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]] of Pittsburgh in the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s of steel into the design.<ref name=FactSh/> Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 65,050&nbsp;seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972 (a year before local telecasts of home games were permitted in the NFL). A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the Great Hall.

==History==

===Planning and funding===
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] shared [[Three Rivers Stadium]] from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pittsburgh Pirates building a full-time [[PNC Park|baseball park]], a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility.<ref name=Bflawed/> Though met with negative reaction from Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a "fallback position" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.<ref name="Steelers Sell Bonds to Help Raise Money for New Stadium"/> Steelers ownership stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the other three teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new football-only stadiums.<ref name="Heinz Field: Standing Up to the Competition"/> In June 2001, the [[H. J. Heinz Company]] purchased the naming rights to the stadium.<ref name="deckard"/> As per the deal, Heinz will pay the Steelers a total of $57&nbsp;million through 2021.<ref name="Stadium naming rights"/><ref name=HFboss/>

Originally, a [[sales tax]] increase was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion of the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]]. After the rejection of this proposal in a referendum, the city developed ''Plan&nbsp;B''.<ref name="Plan B"/> Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled ''Scam&nbsp;B'' by opponents.<ref name="TD"/> The Steelers' pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50&nbsp;million to $76.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=Bflawed/><ref name="Cranmer Still Optimistic on Plan B Deal"/> Other local government members criticized the $281&nbsp;million of public money allocated for ''Plan B''.<ref name="Bflawed"/><ref name="Team Sale Would Trigger Review of Public Stadium Funding"/> One member of the [[Allegheny Regional Asset District]] board called the use of tax dollars "corporate welfare".<ref name="barnes"/> The plan, totaling $809&nbsp;million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field.<ref name="barnes"/><ref name="Arena Won't Be Part of Plan B"/> Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031.<ref name="TD"/> The total cost of Heinz Field was $281&nbsp;million.<ref name=Premium/>

===Design and construction===
[[File:Heinz Field (2005).jpg|thumb|right|A view of Heinz Field at the confluence of the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers]]
Kansas City-based [[Populous (company)|Populous]] (then HOK Sport Venue Event) designed the stadium.<ref name="Football Stadium Architect Selected"/><ref name="Heinz Field"/> Populous' project manager for Heinz Field, Melinda Lehman, stated the [[Rooney family]] asked that the stadium's design "acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going."<ref name=Lehman/> In order to accomplish this, Populous used steel structurally and externally.<ref name=Lehman/> The stone used in Heinz Field's design is [[Cast stone|artificial]], in order to decrease cost.<ref name=Lehman/> Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, "The glass is a more modern building element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in [Downtown] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas."<ref name="Lehman"/> The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design.<ref name="New Steelers, Panthers Locker Rooms Are Separate, Simple"/> As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is [[Aramark]]; over 400&nbsp;eateries are located throughout the stadium.<ref name="Heinz Field1"/> A bronze statue of Steelers founder [[Art Rooney]], similar to [[PNC Park#Design and construction|those located outside PNC Park]], was moved {{convert|100|ft|m}} from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium.<ref name=HFboss/> In addition, a statue of a [[Panthers of Pittsburgh#Panther outside Heinz Field|Pitt Panther]] over a paved depiction of Pitt's [[Cathedral of Learning]] was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27&nbsp;by&nbsp;96&nbsp;foot [[Sony]] [[JumboTron]] was the largest scoreboard in the NFL.<ref name="Game-Day Entertainment Built Around NFL's Biggest Scoreboard"/> In 2007, ESPN named the "tipping" of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.<ref name="Best NFL Touchdown Rituals (continued)"/>

Ground was broken for Heinz Field on June 18, 1999, at a ceremony co-hosted by the Steelers and the University of Pittsburgh.<ref name="Steelers Break Ground for New Football Stadium"/> The stadium was constructed by [[Hunt Construction Group]] and Mascaro Corporation.<ref name="Heinz Field Graphics"/> The two companies directed 1,400&nbsp;workers over two years, in which there were no construction accidents or lawsuits.<ref name="HFboss"/> The stadium is inspected yearly, along with PNC Park, by Chronicle Consulting, LLC, for structural defects and maintenance.<ref name="Sports & Exhibition Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County"/>

==Features==

===Playing surface===
In June 2001, [[Smooth Meadow-grass|Kentucky Bluegrass]] was laid on the field,<ref name="FactSh"/> at half the height of most NFL field's {{convert|2|in|mm|sing=on}} grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of [[antifreeze]] and hot water, to keep the field at around 62&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit (17 degrees Celsius) in order to keep the grass growing year-round.<ref name="grass"/> The field was re-surfaced multiple times, until the synthetic-enhanced [[Desso GrassMaster]] was installed in 2003.<ref name="Greener"/> Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game play. Despite this players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their opponents supported keeping the current turf.<ref name="Debate Rages Over Heinz Field Turf"/>

{{pquote|I need the grass. I like the mud. I like the sloppiness, I'm used to it. Mr. Rooney, can we please keep the grass? I don't want no FieldTurf. It's bad on your knees.|[[Ike Taylor]]<ref name=Turflobby/>}}
On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four [[Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League|WPIAL]] championship football games which were followed the day after with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL,<ref name="Steelers Aim to Dry Out Heinz Field Sod"/> Steelers ownership made the decision to re-surface the field for their [[Monday Night Football|nationally televised game]] against the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A layer of sod was laid overtop the {{convert|2.5|acre|sing=on}} Desso GrassMaster surface.<ref name="Turf Topper: Heinz Field Surface Sporting New Temporary Sod"/> The field's condition was exacerbated by 1<U+00BD>&nbsp;inches of rain after the new sod had been laid,<ref name="Turfpond"/> which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began.<ref name="Heinz Field Surface 'Like a Beach'"/> The Steelers won the game 3<U+2013>0, with a field goal by [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] with 17&nbsp;seconds remaining in regulation.<ref name="Dolphins Continue Woeful Ways, Fall to 0<U+2013>11 After Sloppy Game"/> Scott Brown, of the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]'', called the field a "veritable mud pit".<ref name="Upshaw"/> While [[Gene Upshaw]], head of the [[National Football League Players' Association]], also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league.<ref name=Upshaw/> Steelers receiver [[Hines Ward]] called the playing conditions "horrendous" after the game.<ref name="Steelers Prevail in 'Horrendous' Conditions"/> However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, "I think everybody wants to keep the grass."<ref name="Turflobby"/>  Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend following [[Thanksgiving]] on the road at the team's request.

[[File:SteelersWarmUp.JPG|thumb|right|Heinz Field during warmups before a game]]

Debate continued over the field later in the season when Jacksonville running&nbsp;back [[Fred Taylor (American football)|Fred Taylor]] called the field "a lawsuit pending".<ref name="Taylor No Fan of Steelers' Muck-Like Conditions at Heinz Field"/> Pittsburgh's ownership stated that the decision was up to the players, who once again defended the natural surface.<ref name="Grass or Fake Grass? Steelers Haven't Decided Yet"/> In February 2008, the Steelers announced that they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface.<ref name=Turfpond/> During the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2008 season]] quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] was given a [[concussion]] after being hit at Heinz Field. He later stated, "I'm glad we weren't on FieldTurf. That grass<U+2014>you know, the soft Heinz Field<U+2014>might've helped a little bit."<ref name="Roethlisberger: Heinz Field's Natural Turf Lessened Injury"/> After the 2008 season, a poll of 1,565&nbsp;NFL players rated the surface at Heinz Field as the worst of the 18&nbsp;natural surfaces in the League.<ref name="Players Rate Heinz Field Worst Grass Playing Surface"/>

The DDGrassmaster surface was removed in January 2009 and replaced with the old sod placed on top of the DDGrassmaster surface for the AFC Championship also in January 2009.<ref name="post-gazette.com"/>
NFL fans and players around the league have wondered why the Steelers organization has not adapted to the 21st century by deciding to use an updated artificial turf."<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000054841/article/steelers-david-decastro-injures-acl-mcl-vs-bills</ref> Many of the local high school football fields in the surrounding Pittsburgh area already use artificial turf.

===Field design===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
Unique about the field is the design itself. Initially, the south end zone had either "Steelers" or "Panthers" painted in the end zone, depending on the game itself. The north end zone has always read "Pittsburgh", which is painted in gold lettering and trimmed in either black for the Steelers or dark blue for Pitt.  Although there is typically no midfield logo when both Pitt and the Steelers are in season, both teams have applied their logo if the field's schedule allows for a sufficient break to remove or apply the other team's logo for that team's next upcoming game. The Steelers have typically added their logo to midfield after Pitt's football season has ended.

In 2003, the Steelers played the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in a [[National Football League exhibition season|preseason]] game to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the [[Steagles]] team, when the two merged as a result of player shortages caused by World War II. Steelers president [[Dan Rooney]] had initially considered wearing a [[throwback uniform]] for the game, but decided against it because the merged team wore the Eagles uniforms, and the Steelers didn't want to wear the Eagles' colors. Instead, the team had the south end zone painted in plain diagonal white lines, which were common in NFL endzones until the 1960s.

Although the Steelers lost the game 21<U+2013>16, Rooney liked the look of the south end zone being "plain", and decided to keep it permanently. As with the team's logo at midfield, the Steelers paint "Steelers" in the south end zone once the college football season ends. The plain design in the south end zone has caught on in the NFL, with the [[Green Bay Packers]] also adopting the plain diagonal white lines in the end zones at [[Lambeau Field]].

===Seating and tickets===
As of 2008, the Pittsburgh Steelers have sold out every home game since the [[1972 NFL season|1972 season]].<ref name="CopeDeath"/> Entering the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2008 season]], the Steelers average ticket price of $69.47 was the 15th highest out of the NFL's 32&nbsp;teams.<ref name="Steelers Ticket Prices Again Below League Average"/> The majority of the 65,050&nbsp;seats are colored "Steeler gold", though club seats are dark gray.<ref name=FactSh/><ref name=Lehman/> Heinz Field features 1,500&nbsp;seats in 129&nbsp;luxury&nbsp;boxes, with prices ranging from $64,000 to $135,000 depending on location and size. These boxes were predicted to increase the Steelers' profits from $10 to $11 million per season over those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600&nbsp;club&nbsp;seats that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $2,000 per person.<ref name="Premium"/> For the 2010 season, season ticket prices for Panthers games range from a maximum of $295&nbsp;per club seat with required donations per seat between $250 and $500&nbsp;depending on location, to as low as $87&nbsp;per seat with no required donation for upper end zone sections. Individual game ticket prices ranged from $30 to $65 depending on the seat location and the opponent.<ref name="2010 Ticket Information"/> Attendance for Panthers games has varied from an average high of 59,197 people per game throughout the 2003 season to a low of 43,680 in 2007.<ref name="Off-Campus Location a Factor in Pitt Game Attendance"/> Most recently, Pitt averaged 46,003 in home attendance during the 2011 season.<ref name="Pitt 2011 Cumulative Season Statistics"/>

===Great Hall===
[[File:GreatHallEntrance.jpg|thumb|right|The Great Hall]]
The Great Hall spans approximately {{convert|40000|sqft|m2}} on the east side of the stadium and houses a collection of Steelers and Pittsburgh Panthers memorabilia. The Hall includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise's major events, an oversized Steelers helmet hangs from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows entertainment for fans throughout game days.<ref name=GH/> The Great Hall also features the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame members]] [[Franco Harris]], [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]], and [[Bill Dudley]].<ref name=GH/> Six large [[Vince Lombardi Trophy|Super Bowl trophies]]-shaped display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship the Steelers have won including replica trophies.<ref name=SGH/> Two display columns are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from the Panthers' teams. The floor is painted to resemble the field at Three Rivers Stadium, with the word "Steelers" painted in black over a gold background.<ref name="GH"/> University of Pittsburgh players are featured on two large murals within the Hall. Eight additional tile murals created by local high schools represent western Pennsylvania football history.<ref name="SGH"/> In 2007, the Great Hall was named the best concourse at an NFL stadium by writer Bill Evans, in an article for [[ESPN.com]].<ref name=BestNFL/>

==Seating expansion==
The Steelers notified the [[Pittsburgh Stadium Authority]] in December 2010 of their intention to add up to 4,000 seats to the lower southern end of the stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season.<ref name="Steelers Consider Expanding Heinz Field"/> Seating was added in that section for the [[2011 NHL Winter Classic]] which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010<U+2013>11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.<ref name="Steelers Climb Stairway to Seventh Heaven"/>

On April 12, 2012 the Steelers confirmed they will seek approval from the NFL to expand seating by 3,000.<ref name="Steelers Move to Add 3,000 Seats to Heinz Field"/>  As of October 11, 2012 the SEA and the Steelers are working to construct the seating expansion by September 2013.<ref name="Steelers Eager to Close Deal on Seating at Heinz Field"/>

==Transportation access==
Heinz Field is located at Exit 1B of [[Interstate 279]] within a mile of direct access to both [[Interstate 376]] and [[Interstate 579]].  The stadium also has dedicated elevated walkway access to the [[Allegheny (PAT station)|Allegheny Station]] of the [[Pittsburgh Light Rail|Light Rail/Subway]] system.
