The review aggregator site [[Metacritic]] scored the album a 72 out of 100, based on the reviews of 6 critics, which indicates "generally favorable reviews".<ref name=MC>http://www.metacritic.com/music/killswitch-engage-2009</ref> While praise has been generated around [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]]' vocals and the album's stylistic use of the [[metalcore]] and [[post-hardcore]] genres, criticism has been directed towards [[Adam Dutkiewicz]]'s and [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]'s production as well as the band's reliance on formula. James Christopher Monger of [[Allmusic]] gave the album a positive review, scoring the album a 3.5 out of 5, commenting that "where 2006's "As Daylight Dies" hinted at an accelerated focus on the more melodic aspects of extreme metal, Killswitch Engage cements the notion."<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/killswitch-engage-2009-r1568674/review</ref> Monger indicated "Starting Over", "Reckoning", and "A Light In a Darkened World" as his AMG track picks. ''[[Alternative Press]]'' gave a positive review as well, scoring the album a 4 out of 5, saying "this album isn't going to change the way you think about metal, but Killswitch Engage aren't Mastodon; they just want to get the [[Mosh pit|pit]] going, and this album will surely accomplish that."<ref name="killswitchengage.com"/>

However, Christa Titus of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' gave the album a mixed review, scoring it a 50 out of 100.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/album/killswitch-engage/killswitch-engage-2009/1257128/review</ref> While positively commenting, "As an act that forsakes breakdowns and unintelligible screaming in favor of focused aggression and predictable melodic swells, you can't help but enjoy such quintessential Killswitch Engage tracks as "Never Again" or the Metallica-esque chords that open "The Forgotten," the review concluded, "Aside from a few unique moments ("The Return," "Take Me Away"), there's not much new to report here."<ref>http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1071190/killswitch-engage-killswitch-engage</ref> Adrien Begrand of [[PopMatters]] gave a mixed review as well, scoring the album a 5 out of 10.<ref name="popmatters.com"/> While praising [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]]' vocals, commenting "With its contemplative tone and sense of melodrama, the contagious <U+201C>Starting Over<U+201D> borders on post-hardcore and features some of Jones<U+2019>s strongest vocal melodies to date," and "<U+201C>Reckoning<U+201D> and <U+201C>This is Goodbye<U+201D> feature some very effective melodic death metal touches reminiscent of Swedish stars In Flames and Soilwork, while <U+201C>The Return<U+201D> is a daring foray into teary-eyed power balladry, a terrific showcase for Jones," the review criticized [[Adam Dutkiewicz]]'s and [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]'s overall production, commenting, "Unfortunately, though, the production by Dutkiewicz and mainstream go-to guy Brendan O<U+2019>Brien strips the guitars of any bite whatsoever, rendering the overall tone surprisingly muddy and often flaccid, something we notice most on tracks like <U+201C>Never Again<U+201D> and <U+201C>The Forgotten<U+201D>, which play up the crunchy riffs, but completely lack the power they deserve on record."
