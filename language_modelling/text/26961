==History==
During the [[Edo period]], the area of present-day Shinj<U+014D> was part of [[Shinj<U+014D> Domain]], a 65,000 [[koku]] feudal domain under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] controlled by the [[Tozawa clan]], who ruled from 1622-1871. The domain was centered on [[Shinj<U+014D> Castle]], but the castle and most of the surrounding [[castle town]] was destroyed during the [[Battle of Shinj<U+014D>]] during the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji restoration]].
 
After the start of the [[Meiji period]], the area organized as Shinj<U+014D> Town under [[Mogami District, Yamagata|Mogami District]], Yamagata Prefecture in 1878. The town prospered as a transportation hub with four railway lines, and as a center for horse ranches providing mounts for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] cavalry regiments. The town largely escaped damage during [[World War II]], save for a lone [[air raid]], which killed six people. Shinj<U+014D> became a city on April 1, 1946. It annexed the neighboring villages of Hagino on April 1, 1955 and Yamuki on September 30, 1956.

==Economy==
The economy of Shinj<U+014D> is based on light manufacturing, agriculture and wood products.

==Local attractions==
===Shinj<U+014D> Matsuri===
One of the premier festivals of Yamagata Prefecture, Shinj<U+014D> Matsuri (or Shinj<U+014D> Festival) is a summer-time celebration held annually from August 24<U+2013>26.  Held since 1755, the festival was established by the local ''[[Daimyo|Daimy<U+014D>]]'' (feudal lord) to lift the spirits of the common people after a particularly bad harvest. The current incarnation of the festival includes traditional dancing, a reenactment of the first "''Daimy<U+014D>'' Parade", traditional festival vending stalls, and the ''Yattai'' Parade, in which each neighborhood in the city constructs large, vivid scenes from Japanese/local history, folklore, and/or fairy tales on wide floats. These are then pulled throughout the city by children both at day and at night for the three days of the festival. A traditional ''[[hayashi band]]'' of ''[[taiko]]'' drums, cymbals, ''[[shamisen]]'', and Japanese flute follow behind.  The hands, feet, and faces of the figures on the floats are based on traditional [[Noh]] design. The floats are judged and the three winners displayed in Shinj<U+014D> Station, and the Shinj<U+014D> History Center. The rest are dismantled.
