The '''Erskine''' was an American automobile brand produced by the [[Studebaker]] Corporation of [[South Bend, Indiana]] from [[1927]] to [[1930]].  The brand was named for [[Albert Russel Erskine]] (1871<U+2013>1933) who was the president of the Studebaker Corporation at the time.

During his term as Studebaker<U+2019>s President, Erskine encouraged Studebaker engineers to develop advanced engines.  As a result Studebaker began to amass not only numerous racing wins, but also began to claim more of the upper priced market. This left Studebaker without an entry level automobile in the United States, and Erskine, who had always been fascinated by smaller European vehicles saw market potential in a short wheel based, compact car, especially if it could expand Studebaker's presence in the European market.

When introduced in time for the [[1927]] model year, the car was named after its creator, and marketed as [http://erskine_registry.tripod.com/owners.html The Little Aristocrat]. To make the Erskine affordable, Studebaker fitted the cars with a six-cylinder [[Continental engine]]s rather than the more advanced Studebaker units and priced the cars at $995. Body design was by [[Ray Dietrich]]; the design proved to be quite a head-turner, and received numerous accolades from the British and French press.  Initially, sales demand was promising. However, within a year [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] introduced its [[Model A]] and priced it at $525 dollars, undercutting the Erskine by $470.  

To remedy this, Studebaker marketing suggested that the Erskine become a larger car, which when implemented grew the wheelbase from 108" to 114". The Erskine was no longer small, and became more like its Studebaker brethren.  Ultimately, the Erskine was absorbed into Studebaker by May 1930.  A little over a year later, Studebaker would try again with the 1931 [[Rockne]] brand automobile.

To his credit, Albert Erskine successfully strengthened Studebaker<U+2019>s core automobile business and helped to guide the corporation toward technical advancements that eventually would help the company through the first few years of the depression.  

However Erskine also encouraged the payment of stockholder dividends from Studebaker<U+2019>s capital reserves as the depression deepened; this inflated the value of the stock, and eventually weakened the company. In addition to the two failed marques he created (Rockne and Erskine), Erskine also had purchased luxury car maker [[Pierce-Arrow]] during the high rolling [[1920s]], which had to be sold off to investors as a means of improving cash flow.  

Rather than lose control of Studebaker, Albert R. Erskine committed suicide in 1933 on the grounds of Studebaker<U+2019>s proving grounds (now [[Bendix Woods|Bendix Woods Park]]) outside of [[South Bend, Indiana]].
