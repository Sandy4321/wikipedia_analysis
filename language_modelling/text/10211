'''''Connie Talbot's Christmas Album''''', sometimes referred to as '''''Connie's Christmas Album''''' or just '''''Christmas Album''''', is the second album from English [[child singer]] [[Connie Talbot]], released on 24 November 2008.  The album is made up of [[Christmas music|Christmas-themed songs]], and was recorded in the middle of 2008. Shortly after the release, Pinnacle Entertainment, the United Kingdom distributor, went [[Insolvency|into administration]]. Despite this, the album had some success in Asia and the United States, and Talbot's third album, ''[[Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic]]'', featured many of the same tracks. Talbot appeared publicly to promote the album, including an appearance on [[ITV Central]] in December, and embarked on a tour, making stops around the world. Critics responded warmly to the album, describing Talbot's voice as "sweet".
