The '''silvertip shark''', ''Carcharhinus albimarginatus'', is a large species of [[requiem shark]] found in the [[tropics|tropical]] [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. This species is often encountered around offshore islands and [[coral reef]]s, and has been known to dive to a depth of 800 m (2,600 ft). The silvertip shark resembles a larger, bulkier [[grey reef shark]] (''C. amblyrhynchos''), and can be easily identified by the prominent white margins on its fins. It attains a maximum length of 3 meters (10 ft).

An aggressive, powerful [[apex predator]], the silvertip shark feeds on a wide variety of [[bony fish]]es, as well as [[eagle ray]]s, smaller sharks, and [[cephalopod]]s. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is [[viviparous]], with females giving birth to 1&ndash;11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This species is taken by [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] for its meat and fins, though there is currently insufficient data for the [[World Conservation Union]] to assess its conservation status.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The silvertip shark was originally described as ''Carcharias albimarginatus'' by German naturalist [[Eduard R<U+00FC>ppell]] in "Neue Wirbelthiere zu der Fauna von Abyssinien", published in the 1837 ''Fische des Rothen Meeres'' (''Fishes of the Red Sea''). The [[type specimen]] is a 103 cm (3.4 ft) long immature male caught off [[Ras Muhammad]] in the [[Red Sea]]. The name was later changed to the currently valid ''Carcharhinus albimarginatus''.<ref name="compagno"/> The [[specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''albi'' meaning "white", and ''marginatus'' meaning "to enclose with a border".<ref name="bester">Bester, Cathleen.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:0976_aquaimages.jpg|thumb|left|Silvertip sharks are most often found on or near coral reefs.]]
The silvertip shark is widely but non-continuously distributed in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the western Indian Ocean, this species occurs from the Red Sea to [[South Africa]], including [[Madagascar]], the [[Seychelles]], the [[Aldabra Group]], [[Mauritius]], and the [[Chagos Archipelago]]. In the western Pacific, it is known from off southern [[Japan]] to northern [[Australia]], including [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Guam]], [[Palau]], the [[Solomon Islands]], the [[Marshall Islands]], the [[Phoenix Islands]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from southern [[Baja California]] to [[Colombia]], including the [[Cocos Islands|Cocos]], [[Galapagos]], and [[Revillagigedo Islands]]. Its presence in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] is unconfirmed.<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, Leonard J.V. |date=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization |isbn=9251013845 |pages=455&ndash;457}}</ref>

Silvertip sharks are found over continental and insular shelves at a depth of 30&ndash;800 m (100&ndash;2,600 ft), occupying all levels of the water column. They are most common around isolated islands, coral banks, and reef drop-offs.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="randall and hoover">{{cite book |title=Coastal fishes of Oman |author=Randall, J.E. and Hoover, J.P. |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |date=1995 |isbn=0824818083 |page=28}}</ref> Juveniles frequent coastal shallows or lagoons while adults occur in deeper water, with little overlap between the two age groups.<ref name="bester"/><ref name="ferrari">{{cite book |author=Ferrari, A. and Ferrari, A. |title=Sharks |publisher=Firefly Books |place=New York |date=2002 |isbn=1552096297 |pages=158&ndash;159}}</ref>

==Description==
[[Image:0982_aquaimages.jpg|thumb|The silvertip shark can be recognized by its white-edged fins.]]
The silvertip shark is a robust and streamlined species with a moderately long, broad snout and large round eyes. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short. There are 12&ndash;14 tooth rows on each side of both jaws, with 1&ndash;2 small teeth at the symphysis (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first [[dorsal fin]] is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free [[pectoral fin]] tips. There is a ridge between the first and second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="van der elst and borchert">{{cite journal |title=A Guide to the Common Sea Fishes of Southern Africa |author=Van der Elst, R. and Borchert, P. |edition=third |publisher=Struik |date=1993 |isbn=1868253945 |page=34}}</ref>

The coloration is blue-gray above with a bronze sheen, and white below. There is a subtle white band along the sides and distinctive white tips and borders on all fins. Silvertip sharks can grow up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) long, but typically measure 2.0&ndash;2.5 meters (6.6&ndash;8.2 feet) in length. The maximum reported weight is 162.2 kg (358 lbs).<ref name="bester"/> Females are larger than males.<ref name="ferrari"/>

==Biology and ecology==
[[Image:0984_aquaimages.jpg|thumb|left|240 px|A silvertip shark at New Hanover Island, Papua New Guinea. Individual sharks usually stay at particular reefs.]]
Though silvertip sharks are quite mobile, they exhibit fidelity to certain areas and there are reports of [[territoriality|territorial]] behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stevens, J.D. |date=1984 |title=Life-history and ecology of sharks at Aldabra Atoll, Indian Ocean |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B |volume=222 |pages=79&ndash;106}}</ref><ref name="murch"/> Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water.<ref name="ferrari"/> Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate [[galapagos shark]]s (''C. galapagensis'') and [[blacktip shark]]s (''C. limbatus'') of equal size when competing for food.<ref name="compagno"/> This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. [[Rainbow runner]]s (''Elagatis bipinnulata'') have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off [[parasite]]s.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Private Life of Sharks: The Truth Behind the Myth |author=Bright, M. |publisher=Stackpole Books |date=2000 |page=74 |isbn=0811728757}}</ref> They sometimes follow [[marine mammal]]s such as [[bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops'' sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by [[pilot fish]] (''Naucrates ductor'').<ref name="stafford-deitsch">{{cite book |title=Red Sea Sharks |author=Stafford-Deitsch, J. |publisher=Trident Press Ltd |date=1999 |isbn=1900724367 |pages=34, 53, 70}}</ref>

Like the grey reef shark, silvertip sharks sometimes perform a [[stereotypical behavior|stereotyped]] [[shark threat display|threat display]] if pursued by divers, warning that it is prepared to attack. The display begins with the shark accelerating away to a distance of 15 m (50 ft), before turning and charging towards the perceived threat. At a distance of two body lengths, the shark brakes, turns broadside, drops its pectoral fins, gapes its jaws, lowers the posterior two-thirds of its body, and "shivers". The last two elements of this display are unique to this species; the "shivering" may serve to emphasize its white fin markings. If the diver persists, the shark may rapidly close in and slash with its upper teeth.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin, R.A. |title=A review of shark agonistic displays: comparison of display features and implications for shark-human interactions |journal=Marine and Freshwater Behavior and Physiology |date=Mar. 2007 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=3&ndash;34}}</ref><ref name="martin">Martin, R.A.

===Feeding===
The diet of the silvertip shark consists primarily of bony fishes such as [[grouper]], [[mackerel]], [[tuna]], [[Gempylidae|escolars]], [[lanternfish]], [[flyingfish]], [[wrasse]]s, and [[Soleidae|soles]]. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and [[octopus]] are occasionally taken.<ref name="compagno"/> Larger sharks tend to be more sluggish and take more [[benthic]] prey.<ref name="stafford-deitsch"/> The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of flesh with violent twists and turns.<ref name="ferrari"/> Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food.<ref name="compagno"/> This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.<ref name="grove and lavenberg">{{cite book |title=The Fishes of the Gal<U+00E1>pagos Islands |authors=Grove, J.S. and Lavenber, R.J. |publisher=Stanford University Press |date=1997 |isbn=0804722897 |pages=73&ndash;76}}</ref>

===Life history===
Like other requiem sharks, the silvertip shark is [[viviparous]]; once the [[embryo]]s exhaust their supply of [[yolk]], the depleted [[yolk sac]] develops into a [[placenta]]l connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. In the southern hemisphere, mating and parturition both occur in summer.<ref name="grove and lavenberg"/> Courtship involves the male biting the female to hold her for [[copulation]]; one female observed had the tip of her first dorsal fin bitten off from such activity.<ref name="murch">Murch, A. [http://www.elasmodiver.com/silvertip%20shark.htm Silvertip Shark]. Elasmodiver.com. Retrieved on February 12, 2009.</ref> Females bear litters of 1&ndash;11 (usually 5&ndash;6) young after a [[gestation period]] of about one year. The newborns measure 63&ndash;68 cm (25&ndash;27 in) long.<ref name="compagno"/> The growth rate is highly variable in the wild: Kato and Hernandez (1967) reported that juvenile silvertip sharks grow an average of 3.8 cm (1.5 in), or 5.3% of their body length, per year, with some individuals growing as much as 20.8 cm (8.2 in, 30.1% of their body length) per year, while others show negative "growth".<ref>{{cite book |author=Kato, S. and Hernandez Carvallo, A. |date=1967 |chapter=Shark tagging in the eastern Pacific Ocean, 1962&ndash;65 |pages=93&ndash;109 |title=Sharks, Skates, and Rays |editor=Gilbert, P.W., Mathewson, R.F. and Rail, D.P. |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |place=Baltimore}}</ref> Males are [[sexual maturation|sexually mature]] at 1.6&ndash;1.8 m (5.2&ndash;5.9 ft) long and females at 1.6&ndash;2.0 m (5.2&ndash;6.6 ft) long.<ref name="compagno"/>

==Human interactions==
[[Image:0979_aquaimages.jpg|thumb|Silvertip sharks often behave boldly towards divers.]]
Inquisitive and bold, especially in the presence of food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often several silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which can be an intimidating experience as the sharks may approach quite close.<ref>{{cite book |title=Diving With Sharks and Other Adventure Dives |author=Jackson, J. |publisher=New Holland Publishers |date=2000 |isbn=1859742394 |page=31}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Fascination for Fish: Adventures of an Underwater Pioneer |author=Powell, D.C. |publisher=University of California Press |date=2003 |isbn=0520239172 |pages=138&ndash;139}}</ref> This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers.<ref name="grove and lavenberg"/> In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off of a dummy dressed in [[SCUBA]] gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries.<ref name="compagno"/> As of 2008, the [[International Shark Attack File]] lists four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.<ref>[http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/statistics/species2.htm ISAF Statistics on Attacking Species of Shark].

The silvertip shark is caught by commercial and [[artisan fishing|artisan fisheries]] using [[longline fishing|longline]]s and [[gillnet]]s, both intentionally and as [[bycatch]]. It is susceptible to [[overfishing]] due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency to stay in a certain area, and is becoming rare in many parts of its range.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="ferrari"/> The fins are highly valued for [[shark fin soup]] and the meat is sold fresh or dried and salted. The skin and [[cartilage]] are also utilized.<ref name="fishbase">{{fishbase species |genus=Carcharhinus |species=albimarginatus |month=January |year=2009}}</ref> Due to a paucity of fisheries information, the [[World Conservation Union]] deemed this species to be [[Data Deficient]] worldwide. In Australia, where this species is not exploited commercially, it has been assessed as of [[Least Concern]].<ref name="iucn"/>
