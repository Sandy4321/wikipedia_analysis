'''Gyro Gearloose''' is a [[fictional character]], an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[chicken]] created by [[Carl Barks]] for [[The Walt Disney Company]]. He is part of the [[Scrooge McDuck]] [[Scrooge McDuck universe|universe]], appearing in [[comic book]] stories as a friend of [[Donald Duck]], Scrooge and anyone who is associated with them.

==Fictional character biography==
Gyro is [[Duckburg]]'s most famous inventor, even though his inventions don't always work the way he wants them to. His outrageous productivity is presented as a factor in the quality of his inventions; because he always comes up with new ideas, the fact that his inventions often lack an important feature, will often cause trouble for Scrooge or Donald who have bought the invention. He is known as being good-natured towards others. Gyro is often assisted by his [[Little Helper (Disney)|Little Helper]] (or just "Helper"), who is a small anthropomorphic [[robot]] with a [[Incandescent light bulb|light bulb]] for a head.
Besides Little Helper, he has also a [[thinking cap]], a combination of a roof-top and a nest, with three living black birds living in it.

Some of Gyro's relatives include his father [[Gearloose family#Fulton Gearloose|Fulton Gearloose]], his grandfather [[Gearloose family#Ratchet Gearloose|Ratchet Gearloose]], and [[Gearloose family#Newton Gearloose|Newton Gearloose]], his [[Cousin|nephew]]. In some stories, Gyro's primary rival is [[Emil Eagle]] although he is also antagonized by the [[Beagle Boys]] and [[Magica De Spell]].

==Appearances in other media==
Gyro made his first animated appearance on the Sport Goofy ''Soccermania'' TV special with only one line of dialogue: "Scrooge parting with a million dollars?". In the subsequent 1987 [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[DuckTales]]'', Gyro became a regular character, with [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] supplying his voice. Among Gyro's noteworthy inventions in the series was the creation of the [[Fenton Crackshell|GizmoDuck]] suit, intended to be worn by a security guard for Scrooge McDuck's [[Money Bin]].

Contrary to his entry in [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]], Gyro never once appeared on ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (in fact, Gyro's usual role as an inventor is replaced with [[Ludwig Von Drake]] in both House of Mouse and many other cartoons).

In the [[Toontown Online|Toontown]] universe Gyro created the cogs, the main [[antagonist]]s of the game. They are grim business-men-like robots, who can't take a joke, so to take care of the infestation, the toons (the main protagonists of the game), destroy them with gags, such as squirting seltzer water and throwing pies at them.
