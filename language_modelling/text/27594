'''Volcanic ash''' consists of small [[tephra]], which are bits of pulverized rock and glass created by [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions,<ref name="TEPHRA">[[United States Geological Survey]]. [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Tephra/tephra.html Tephra: Volcanic Rock and Glass Fragments.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-23]].</ref> less than {{convert|2|mm|in}} in diameter.  The violent nature of volcanic eruptions involving steam results in the [[magma]] and solid rock surrounding the vent being torn into particles of [[clay]] to [[sand]] size.  Volcanic ash can lead to breathing problems, malfunctions in machinery, and from more severe eruptions, years of [[global cooling]].  

After falling to the ground after the eruption, the ash deposited on the ground becomes known as an ashfall.  Some of this ashfall can become cemented together to form a solid rock called [[tuff]].   Over [[geologic time]], the ejection of large quantities of ash will produce an [[volcanic cones|ash cone]].  Significant accumulations of ashfall can lead to the immediate death of most of the local ecosystem, as well the collapse of roofs on man-made structures.  Over time, ashfall can lead to the creation of fertile soils.

==Spread==
The plume that is often seen above an erupting volcano is composed primarily of ash and steam. The very fine particles may be carried for many miles, settling out as a dust-like layer across the landscape.  This is known as an ashfall.<ref>Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/ashfall Ashfall.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-23]].</ref>  If liquid magma is ejected as a spray, the particles will solidify in the air as small fragments of volcanic glass.  Unlike the ash that forms from burning wood or other [[Combustion|combustible]] materials, volcanic ash is hard and abrasive.  It does not dissolve in water, and it conducts electricity, especially when it is wet.  Ashfall can become cemented together by heat to form a solid rock called tuff.<ref>Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. [http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/tuff Tuff.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-23]].</ref>  Ashfall breaks down over time, forming highly fertile soil, which has made many volcanic regions densely cultivated and inhabited despite the inherent dangers.<ref>Skwirk.

==Atmospheric effects==
[[Image:SoufriereHillsdayashfall.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Daytime Montserrat image during ash fall (1997)]]
When ash begins to fall during daylight hours, the sky turns hazy and a pale yellow color.  The ashfall may become so dense that daylight turns the sky gray to pitch black, with the ash severely restricting visibility and deadening sound.  A darkened ash sky lowers temperatures during daylight hours from what would otherwise be expected.  Loud thunder and lightning as well as the strong smell of sulfur accompany an ashfall.<ref>[[United States Geological Survey]]. [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/ash/ashfall.html What's it like during an ash fall?] Retrieved on [[2008-01-23]].</ref>  If rain accompanies an ashfall, the tiny particles turn into a slurry of slippery mud.  Rain and lightning combined with ash leads to power outages, prevents communication, and disorients people.<ref name="asheffect">[[United States Geological Survey]].

Very fine ash particles can remain high in the atmosphere for many years, spread around the world by high-altitude winds.  This suspended material contributes to spectacular sunsets, as well as an optical phenomenon known as "[[Bishop's Ring]]", which refers to a corona or halo effect around the sun.<ref>Glossary of Meteorology.

==Dangers==
The most devastating effect of volcanic ash comes from [[pyroclastic flow]]s.  These occur when a volcanic eruption creates an "avalanche" of hot ash, gases, and rocks that flow at high speed down the flanks of the volcano.  These flows can be impossible to outrun.<ref>[[United States Geological Survey]]. [http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/PF/PFFormation.html Generation of Pyroclastic Flows.] Retrieved on [[2008-01-23]].</ref>  In 1902, the city of St. Pierre in [[Martinique]] was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow which killed over 29,000 people.<ref>Zananas.

Volcanic ash is not poisonous, but inhaling it may cause problems for people whose respiratory system is already compromised by disorders such as [[asthma]] or [[emphysema]]. The abrasive texture can cause irritation and scratching of the surface of the eyes.  People who wear [[contact lens]]es should wear [[glasses]] during an ashfall, to prevent eye damage.  Furthermore, the combination of volcanic ash with moisture in the lungs can create a substance akin to liquid cement.  Therefore, people should take caution to filter the air they breathe with a damp cloth or a face mask when facing an ashfall.  Ash is very dense, as only {{convert|100|mm|in}} of ash leads to the collapse of weaker roofs.  A fall of {{convert|300|mm|in}} leads to the death of most vegetation, livestock, the wiping out of aquatic life in nearby lakes and rivers, and unusable roads.<ref>GNS Science.

===Aviation===

Volcanic ash jams machinery.  This poses a great danger to [[aircraft]] flying near ash clouds.  There are many instances of damage to jet aircraft as a result of an ash encounter.  Engines quit as fuel and water systems become fouled, requiring repair.  After the [[Galunggung]], [[Indonesia]] volcanic event in 1982, a [[British Airways Flight 9|British Airways Boeing 747]] flew through an ash cloud that fouled all 4 engines, stopping them.  The plane descended from {{convert|36000|ft|m}} to {{convert|12000|ft|m}} before the crew could manage to restart the engines.<ref name="RILEY">C. M.

==Advisories concerning ongoing events==
Increasing numbers of airplane incidents from atmospheric ash prompted a 1991 aviation industry meeting to decide how best to distribute information about ash events.  One solution was the creation of Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers.  There is one VAAC for each of nine regions of the world.  VAACs can issue advisories and serve as liaisons between meteorologists, volcanologists, and the aviation industry.<ref>[[NESDIS]].
