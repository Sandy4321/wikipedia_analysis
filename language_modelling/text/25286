'''Erik-<U+00D8>rn Gjems-Onstad''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (22 February 1922 <U+2013> 18 November 2011) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance member]], officer, lawyer, sports official, politician, author and anti-immigration activist. Gjems-Onstad joined the Norwegian resistance movement after [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invaded]] Norway in 1940. He was arrested in [[Sweden]] for his involvement with Norwegian resistance activity in the country in 1941. He was sent to the [[United Kingdom]] later the same year, where he joined the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] (''Kompani Linge'') and received British military training. He was deployed to Norway in 1943 as part of [[Lark (Norwegian resistance)|Lark]], with the mission of establishing radio connection with [[London]] and to operate the radio transmitter. He led Lark in [[Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]] between 1943 and 1945, which constituted the leadership of [[Milorg]] in the region. His other activities included to assist with weapons smuggling, prepare the sinking of the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'' and plotting to assassinate Nazi collaborator [[Ivar Grande]]. He also founded the [[Durham (Norwegian resistance)|Durham]] organisation for conducting [[psychological warfare]] towards the end of the war, and he took part in blowing up railway tracks. Gjems-Onstad's efforts during the [[World War II|Second World War]] led him to become one of Norway's highest decorated war heroes.

He joined the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Norwegian Home Guard]] after the war, where he served as a captain. He completed education in [[law]], and also worked as a judge and lawyer. He ultimately reached the rank of colonel in the military, as military lawyer of a branch of the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]]. For some years he was CEO of a project that planned to develop the [[Vaterland, Norway|Vaterland]] neighbourhood in Oslo. Gjems-Onstad also had a career in sports, representing the sports club [[SK Rye]] in [[cycling]] and [[racewalking]]. He later worked as a sports official as board member and chairman of various national sports bodies.

A former member of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] organisation [[Libertas (Norway)|Libertas]], Gjems-Onstad joined [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange's Party]] when it was founded in 1973 and became the party's deputy leader. He was elected a Member of Parliament in the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]], and became the party's [[parliamentary leader]] following [[Anders Lange]]'s death in 1974. Much of his views and proposals spurred controversy, and he also got in conflict with the new leadership of the party, which was eventually headed by [[Carl I. Hagen]]. Gjems-Onstad was expelled from the party in 1976, and finished his term as an [[independent (politician)|independent]]. He also became known for criticising the Norwegian government's policy in [[Africa]], and for defending the governments of countries such as [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]]. In the 1980s he worked as a defender for several anti-immigration activists, and from the late 1980s he became involved in anti-immigration politics himself. He stood in election for the [[Stop Immigration]] party in 1989 and for the [[Fatherland Party (Norway)|Fatherland Party]] in 1991, and he was later involved in the organisations ''[[Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring]]'' and [[Stop Islamisation of Norway]]. He was briefly active locally in the Conservative Party and the [[Pensioners' Party (Norway)|Pensioners' Party]] in the late 2000s.

==Early life==
Erik-<U+00D8>rn Gjems-Onstad was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (modern-day Oslo) to jurist and civil servant Olaf Gjems-Onstad (1882<U+2013>1945) and architect <U+00C5>got Urbye (1886<U+2013>1959). He worked at sea as a [[cabin boy]] in 1937, and went to port in both [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].<ref name=bio/><ref>{{cite news|title=Akseptering av andres meninger|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=70995&page=15&date=16.2.1993|date=16 February 1993|accessdate=24 November 2011|language=Norwegian|page=15|first=Erik|last=Gjems-Onstad|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}</ref> He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1940.<ref name=bio/>

Gjems-Onstad was active in the [[Scouting|boy scouts]] before the invasion, and he was because of his experience there asked to instruct in map and compass for a volunteer military training program in late 1939. He thereafter became [[Scout Leader|scout leader]] as the former leader went to fight in the [[Winter War]]. Due to the war in Europe, the scout exercises became increasingly serious,<ref name=go199113/> and the scout movement arguably had a big part in the early organisation of the Norwegian resistance.<ref name="Gjems-Onstad">Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 16.</ref> In the winter of 1939/40, Gjems-Onstad commenced training in [[orienteering]] and signaling during the night.<ref name=ego08>{{cite episode |title=Spekter temakveld: Krigsveteran|network=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |station=[[NRK2]] |airdate=4 April 2008}}</ref> The weekend before the invasion, he and a friend were "preparing for war" by training and sleeping in a tent outdoors in the snow in the forest Vestmarka, something that was highly unusual to do at the time.<ref name=go199113/><ref name=wings/>

==Second World War==
===Early activities===
[[File:German_soldiers_in_Oslo_9_April_1940.jpg|right|thumb|190px|German soldiers marching through Oslo on 9 April 1940. The boy on the bike to the left has traditionally been regarded to be [[Gunnar S<U+00F8>nsteby]], but Gjems-Onstad later claimed he had evidence that it was actually him.<ref name="morg">{{cite news|url=http://www.morgenbladet.no/article/20091016/OAKTUELT/710169929|work=[[Morgenbladet]]|title=Helten som ikke passer inn|first=Simen|last=S<U+00E6>tre|language=Norwegian|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>]] 
On 9 April 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|invaded]] and [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied Norway]] as a part of the Second World War. Gjems-Onstad became aware of the German presence when he and his family saw German planes flying right over their home. They did not get any notification of what was happening, and only music was played on the radio.<ref name=go199113>Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 13.</ref><ref name=ego08/> Gjems-Onstad took his bike and cycled to his school, the [[Oslo Cathedral School]], only to find it closed and in a chaotic state. He thereafter went to the city centre and ''[[Karl Johans gate]]'', where he witnessed the Germans marching through.<ref name=ego08/><ref name="morg"/><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 14.</ref> The next (or possibly the same) day, a German [[Junkers]] plane crashed near him and his friend when they were on their way from [[Lysaker]] to get a closer view of the captured [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu Airport]]. He briefly found himself in the situation of attempting to rescue the Germans trapped inside the plane, but the heat was unbearable and the two were told by the Germans to run away and get in safety just moments before the plane exploded.<ref name=wings>{{cite book|title=Fornebu 9. april|pages=299<U+2013>300|publisher=Wings|location=Oslo|first=Cato|last=Guhnfeldt|year=1990|isbn=8299219418}}</ref><ref name="Gjems-Onstad"/> The proclamation by Norwegian Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]] on 10 April (that rejected the German claim to appoint [[Vidkun Quisling]] as Norwegian Prime Minister), was according to Gjems-Onstad received with great disappointment by him and his friends. He thought it contained nothing but verbiage, with no remarks about mobilisation, defence, fighting or war. He thereafter wanted to join the resistance, but on his way met a man who told him that he would be rejected if he had not been through [[recruit training]], and he thus returned home. After a few days, he and a friend nevertheless set out for [[Northern Norway]]. They came as far north as [[Nord-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]], where they however gave up and returned home.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 15<U+2013>16.</ref>

Gjems-Onstad started studying at the [[University of Oslo]] in late 1940, and he got in touch with students who wanted to organise a resistance movement. One time, he and other youth who sympathised with the resistance disrupted a public meeting held by the fascist party ''[[Nasjonal Samling]]'' (NS). They deliberately clapped their hands so relentlessly (they considered that they could not get punished for "cheering") that the speakers could not speak, and thereafter started leaving the room. Many were however blocked from leaving, and Gjems-Onstad and a few others were arrested and fined due to their role in the event. In September he participated in a clash between students and a group of ''[[Hird]]'' members (the NS's paramilitary organisation) outside the university. A young boy came by during the initial stand-off, asking Gjems-Onstad what was happening. Gjems-Onstad responded that the others were traitors, and ''Hird'' members thus captured him and beat him up. Later, due to an outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in December, Gjems-Onstad took part in digging mass graves for slaughtered cows in [[Dikemark]] and in [[Nes<U+00F8>ya, Akershus|Nes<U+00F8>ya]].<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1991, pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref>

[[File:Erik Gjems-Onstad.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Erik Gjems-Onstad in the early 1940s.]]
In late 1940, an engineer had created some military inventions which Gjems-Onstad's group wanted to bring to the Allied forces. It was decided that one of them was to travel to the UK, while Gjems-Onstad was to travel to [[Stockholm]]. Gjems-Onstad was joined by three others, and they decided to let themselves be arrested in [[<U+00D6>stmark]] in Sweden. They were transported to Stockholm, but the Norwegian [[legation]] was not interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was later tipped to contact the British [[military attach<U+00E9>]]. He got in contact with Major [[Malcolm Munthe]], who in turn was interested in the inventions. Gjems-Onstad was arrested by Swedish police in Stockholm on 25 March 1941, as parts of Munthe's organisation had been exposed. Gjems-Onstad was imprisoned at the Stockholm police station for 13 days, and then for 59 days in the Stockholm Remand Prison.<ref name=go199119>Gjems-Onstad, 1991, p. 19.</ref> On 23 May 1941 the government decided that he was to be expelled and banned from entering Sweden (the ban was repealed after the war).<ref name=go199119/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=52923&page=1&date=12.11.1974|title=Gjems-Onstad utvist p<U+00E5> livstid i 1941|language=Norwegian|date=12 November 1974|accessdate=10 December 2011|pages=1 and 19|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}</ref> He was originally scheduled to be deported to [[Canada]] via [[Moscow]] and [[China]], but the plans were halted due to the German invasion of the [[Soviet Union]]. He was instead sent to the Norwegian refugee camp in [[<U+00D6>reryd]].<ref name=go199119/> He was ordered by the British to escape from <U+00D6>reryd in October 1941 and travel to Norway. He was captured by the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Swedish Home Guard]] close to the Norwegian border, but was sent by plane to the UK by Swedish authorities in December.<ref name=go199119/>

===In the resistance===
When Gjems-Onstad arrived in the UK, he joined the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] (''Kompani Linge'') and took British military education.<ref name=bio>{{stortingetbio|ERGJ}}</ref> The British decided in 1943 to deploy him to [[Tr<U+00F8>ndelag]] in Norway together with [[Odd S<U+00F8>rli (Norwegian resistance)|Odd S<U+00F8>rli]], [[Johnny Pevik]] and [[Nils Uhlin Hansen]].<ref name="chr133">Christensen, 2011, p. 133.</ref><ref name=kl66>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 66.</ref> The deployment was necessary as [[Evald Hansen]] and [[Herluf Nygaard]] had been captured and tortured in December 1942 (Nygaard later escaped, Hansen died at [[Falstad concentration camp|Falstad]]).<ref>Christensen, 2011, p. 132.</ref> S<U+00F8>rli and Gjems-Onstad were set to maintain [[Lark (Norwegian resistance)|Lark]], establish radio connection with London and get intelligence about the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]'', which at the time was located in the [[Trondheimsfjord]].<ref name=kl66/> When he was training at Glen More Lodge near [[Aviemore]], Gjems-Onstad was ordered to go to London, where he was supplied with a 20kg radio transmitter and other equipment. Together with S<U+00F8>rli he travelled to [[Inverness]] by train, and to [[Shetland]] by plane, under stormy weather conditions.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 25<U+2013>28.</ref> They initially set out with the fishing boat ''Harald II'' from [[Scalloway]] in late February, but due to unusually stormy weather they were driven back to Shetland three times after three unsuccessful attempts to reach [[<U+00C5>lesund]]; the last attempt destroyed their equipment as the boat was bursted open.<ref name=kl66/><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 30<U+2013>34.</ref> They had their equipment replaced, and set out for [[Kristiansund]] in March instead on a bigger boat. With easier, yet still poor weather, the voyage took two days. When they reached land they noticed that they had reached [[Kya Lighthouse]], much farther to the north of their original destination, but they decided to make landfall anyway.<ref name=kl66/><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 34<U+2013>35.</ref> From there they travelled with fake identification via [[Namsos]] to Trondheim, where they reunited with fellow Lark members Johnny Pevik and Nils Uhlin Hansen, the other group sent from London.<ref>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 66<U+2013>68.</ref><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 36<U+2013>39.</ref> Gjems-Onstad thereafter assisted Pevik and Hansen with transporting five tons of weapons from an uninhabited island near Lyngv<U+00E6>r to Trondheim.<ref name="chr133"/>

Lark received missions from London (sometimes via Stockholm), and constituted the leadership of [[Milorg]] in Tr<U+00F8>ndelag where they in practice were the same entity.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 117.</ref> Gjems-Onstad started his operations in Trondheim by establishing radio connection with London and operating the radio transmitter,<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 43<U+2013>44.</ref> and he soon became one of the most important persons in the leadership of Milorg.<ref>Alming, 1995, p. 94.</ref> His saboteur activity included to prepare the sinking of ''Tirpitz'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://onlinesos.aftenposten.no/tjenester/archive/show.htm?catalog=40631&page=5&date=22.2.1982|title=Kampglad kriger|language=Norwegian|date=22 February 1982|accessdate=10 December 2011|page=5|work=[[Aftenposten]]}}</ref> but the plans were never realised as the ship had left the Trondheimsfjord in early 1943.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 48<U+2013>49.</ref> S<U+00F8>rli commanded Gjems-Omstad to a spontaneous assassination of Nazi collaborator [[Ivar Grande]] after spotting him incidentally, but Gjems-Onstad aborted after noticing a division of Russian [[Prisoner of war|POWs]], fearing for what in turn might happen to them if he went through with the assassination.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 55.</ref> Some days later he again plotted to assassinate Grande together with S<U+00F8>rli and Ingebrigt Gausland. They delivered a box [[booby trap]]ped with an egg hand grenade to his home, but Grande foiled the attempt with advice Norwegian [[Gestapo]] agent [[Henry Rinnan]] (who was present at the time) had received on not to open such boxes.<ref>Christensen, 2011, pp. 139<U+2013>140.</ref><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 55<U+2013>57.</ref> Following the attempted assassination, he was ordered to not get himself involved in any further such attempts, as it was considered too risky for him.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 98.</ref> Gjems-Onstad took over as leader of the group from S<U+00F8>rli in October 1943,<ref name="go1995a">Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 174.</ref> and it was decided to pull him out of Norway and close the radio station following news that Pevik had been arrested.<ref>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 71.</ref> He left Trondheim for Stockholm later that month, and received training in [[psychological warfare]].<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 58<U+2013>59.</ref>

When S<U+00F8>rli came to Stockholm in January 1944 he took over for Gjems-Onstad, while Gjems-Onstad was to take over the leadership of Lark as well as to reorganise Milorg.<ref name="go1990a">Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 59.</ref> Gjems-Onstad also founded the propaganda organisation [[Durham (Norwegian resistance)|Durham]] when he came back to Trondheim in March 1944.<ref name="go1995b"/> Lark and Durham were to be kept completely separate, with Gjems-Onstad as their only mutual connection.<ref name="go1990a"/> Durham's mission was to influence the moral of the enemy, mainly through distributing brochures (an estimated 115,000 copies in total) and posters (an estimated 257,000), while also to cause irritation by minor sabotage. The brochures were chiefly distributed in the enemy's quarters, and the posters were put up throughout Trondheim.<ref name="go1995b">Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 175.</ref> Members of the group also tore down Nazi posters, sabotaged German vehicles, threw [[stink bomb]]s into restaurants and cinemas, and applied [[itching powder]]<U+2014>notably in [[condom]]s for sale to German soldiers. Sabotage on a bigger scale had to be authorised from London, and was largely discouraged as it would risk unnecessary German reprisals.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 137.</ref> Gjems-Onstad reported back in Stockholm at the end of June.<ref>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 72<U+2013>78.</ref><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 64.</ref> Eager to bring supplies to Trondheim, he and S<U+00F8>rli soon decided to transport propaganda material, handguns and explosives to the Norwegian border. After finding a lost resistance member in the mountains, Gjems-Onstad joined a course in [[Alby, Botkyrka|Alby]] near Stockholm where he worked as instructor in "silent killing" for a month.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 73.</ref> He went for a short mission to Trondheim in July in order to insert Egil L<U+00F8>kse as Lark's new radio operator there.<ref name="JRU">Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 78.</ref>

By his next time in Trondheim, the Gestapo had gained knowledge of Gjems-Onstad's activities, and did their outermost to capture him.<ref name="JRU"/> Gjems-Onstad went back to Trondheim at the end of October. He was to establish a new radio station, and investigate if Milorg and Lark could be rebuilt, as the organisation had been severely damaged by multiple arrests and murders.<ref>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, pp. 78<U+2013>80.</ref> Durham was however largely intact. The mission went into a new phase, as the Norwegian resistance started organising defence against potential destructions during the now largely inevitable German withdrawal. A continuation of the [[scorched earth]] policy practiced in Northern Norway was particularly feared. Gjems-Onstad and Lark were not to lead the defence, but rather to organise it and train new recruits.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 74<U+2013>80, 135.</ref> In November he authorised the creation of the illegal newspaper ''For Friheten'' by his own initiative, the first in Trondheim in years.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 94.</ref> He also operated the paper ''DFP'', or ''Deutsche Freiheitspartei'', a form of [[black propaganda]] distributed to German soldiers and officers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Den frie hemmelige pressen i Norge under okkupasjonen 1940-45: en fortellende bibliografi|first=Hans|last=Luihn|published=Nasjonalbiblioteket|year=1999|page=40|isbn=8279650105}}</ref> He became increasingly frustrated with the damages caused by Rinnan and his gang of Nazi collaborators, and he vocally advocated their assassination.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 98<U+2013>100, 178.</ref> He reported back to Stockholm in November, and as he saw it, little remained of Milorg in Tr<U+00F8>ndelag after this. He however noted the importance of Durham, which he considered to have grown very powerful.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 102<U+2013>103.</ref>

In early 1945 Gjems-Onstad took part in blowing up railway tracks on the stretches around [[St<U+00F8>ren Station]], but the group had a limited supply of explosives, and the practical effects of the bombings could thus not cause as much effect as wanted. They could for instance not go through with blowing up the railway bridge near [[Hovin, S<U+00F8>r-Tr<U+00F8>ndelag|Hovin]], which they sought as their main target.<ref name="go1995c">Gjems-Onstad, 1995, p. 176.</ref><ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 142<U+2013>151.</ref> He was transferred back to Stockholm in March 1945,<ref>Jensen, Ratvik & Ulstein, 1995, p. 80.</ref> and Durham was dissolved.<ref name="Alming">Alming, 1995, p. 98.</ref> He reacted with shock that London had decided that it was too dangerous for him to return to Trondheim.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 165<U+2013>166.</ref> He was uneasy about being set on the sideline, and headed a mission of four men from Stockholm to [[Namsvatnet]] at the end of the month to receive British sabotage supplies. They established a base of operations, as well as radio connection to the UK by the station ''Quail''. The mission returned to Stockholm in early April, and Gjems-Onstad was transferred to a mission in Northern Norway.<ref name="go1995c"/> He was in [[Troms]] at the time of the German capitulation.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 176.</ref>

Gjems-Onstad became critical of the "retracted regional leadership" of the Home Front (''hjemmefronten'') which he became aware of in late 1944. According to him, he and his fellow resistance members had not even heard of their existence. He sent a wire to London requesting that they should take over what remained of Milorg, rather than remaining passive during the occupation only to step forward as leaders of Milorg when the war was over. He became more critical when he became aware that they had started entering the administration in London and Stockholm, according to him without the necessary experience from practical fieldwork. He was shocked at the recklessness of one of them who arrived at one of their bases in Trondheim, concluding that they "obviously had no idea about how strong the infiltration really was in Trondheim, nor how we worked." The regional leadership that stepped forward after the war was according to Gjems-Onstad not identical with the actual leadership of Lark and Milorg during the war.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, pp. 117<U+2013>119.</ref>

Historians have noted that it was "very surprising" that [[Erling Gjone]] stepped forward as the leader of the Home Front in Tr<U+00F8>ndelag after the German capitulation. He had entered the administration in Stockholm in February 1945, but he had not been contacted whatsoever by Lark.<ref name="Alming"/> The decision of putting Gjems-Onstad on the sideline in March 1945 led him to become increasingly critical of the leadership in London, which had gradually become more Norwegian than British, and subsequently decayed into what Gjems-Onstad considered to be a lack of professionality. He also questioned Norway's military abilities in a possible future war in Norway, based on post-war developments.<ref>Gjems-Onstad, 1990, p. 169.</ref> According to Gjems-Onstad, what influenced him and his contemporaries to join the resistance was a national feeling that<U+2014>speaking some 60 years after war<U+2014>he then considered that was "almost gone."<ref name=ego08/> 

Gjems-Onstad deliberated his post-war views on the war in a 2008 ten-minute television special. As he saw it, the Norwegian [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Labour Party government]] before the war stood "entirely on the side of the [[Soviet Union]]." He pointed to the Soviet Union as the greatest murderer of the war, and considered that nobody had "opened their eyes" to the fact that the Soviet Union was the only country that won territorial gains following the war. While he maintained that the coup headed by [[Vidkun Quisling]] was both bad and illegal, he considered that Quisling should be judged softer in light of the situation at the time. He pointed to the government fleeing the country, and what he considered the "pitiful" reaction of Prime Minister [[Johan Nygaardsvold]]. He also noted that while some of the figures in the [[Quisling regime]] had acted out way too harshly, some others had tried to maintain Norway's interests against the occupiers; the alternative of letting the Germans run the country completely unopposed under [[Josef Terboven]] could in his mind have ended up far worse. Gjems-Onstad said he believed that the treason by Quisling should be compared with the lack of preparations for war by Nygaardsvold and the Labour Party government.<ref name=ego08/> Gjems-Onstad also complained that he for unexplained reasons had been kept away from public arrangements related to the Second World War. He said he had not been invited to a single such event. He was also in possession of a large archive of wartime material from the resistance movement in Tr<U+00F8>ndelag, but said he had not been approached with interest by any public institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/arkivert/21063/|title=Krigshelt bitter p<U+00E5> Trondheim|publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 November 2011|year=2008}}</ref>

==Professional career==
Gjems-Onstad joined the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Norwegian Home Guard]] after the war. From 1947 to 1959 he held the rank of captain there. He was mobilisation manager as military lawyer colonel at Strike Command Southern Norway (''Luftkommando S<U+00F8>r-Norge''), one of the Air Commands of the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]], from 1970 to 1980. He also completed his education in law, graduating with a [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1948. He worked as a judge in southern [[Buskerud]] from 1948 to 1949, and in 1949 he opened a [[law firm]] in Oslo. From 1957 he had access to work with [[Supreme Court (Norway)|Supreme Court]] cases. He was also a consultant or secretary for ''Norsk Gartnerforening'', ''Bruktbilhandlerforeningen/Autoriserte Bruktbilhandleres handelsforbund'' and for the local branch of the [[Norwegian Bar Association]]. He was a board member of the local Bar Association chapter from 1960 to 1964 and of Max Manus AS, the eponymous company belonging to former resistance member [[Max Manus]], from 1965 to 1969.<ref name=bio/> Gjems-Onstad had served with Manus in the Norwegian Home Guard after the war, and had met his later wife [[Tikken Manus]] for the first time in 1943 when she worked as a [[military attach<U+00E9>]] in [[Stockholm]].

==Politics==
===Member of Parliament===
From 1960 to 1964 Gjems-Onstad was a member of the school board in Oslo, representing the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].<ref name=bio/> He was also a member of the libertarian organisation [[Libertas (Norway)|Libertas]], but had left it by 1971 as he considered that it had become "too tame."<ref>Mauseth, 1991, p. 30.</ref> When [[Progress Party (Norway)|Anders Lange's Party]] (ALP) was founded in 1973 he joined the party and became deputy leader under [[Anders Lange]]. He had been present at the founding meeting at ''Saga kino'', and was offered a place in the party's central leadership by Anders Lange after they one day incidentally met outside Gjems-Onstad's lawyer's office. From then on he was the most central person in the party after Lange himself. Besides his leading positions in business and sports, Gjems-Onstad had for years expressed his political views in newspapers and journals, which broadly coincided with Lange's views. By offering him positions in the party, Lange particularly thought that Gjems-Onstad could help develop the party politically and organisationally.<ref>Iversen, 1998, pp. 28<U+2013>29.</ref> In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1973|1973 parliamentary election]] he won a seat in the [[Storting|Norwegian Parliament]] from [[Akershus]], and became a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and the Election Committee.<ref name=bio/> During his term he set a new record for number of times speaking to the assembly&mdash;325 times in one year.<ref>{{cite news|title=<U+2013> M<U+00E5>le krefter og viljestyrke|last=Hjelmark|first=Mette|date=21 June 1980|work=[[Verdens Gang{{!}}VG]]|page=26|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

At the start of his parliamentary term he made some proposals that were opposed by the entire parliament, including his own party. He proposed in November 1973 to introduce gun and shooting training as an optional course for students in high school, and to [[Separation of church and state|separate church and state]] (with its financial implications).
