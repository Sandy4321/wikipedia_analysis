{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
The '''Christian Democratic Party''' (in Dutch: ''Christen-Democratische Partij'', CDP) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Christian left|left-wing]] [[christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] [[political party]]. The CDP played only a minor role in parliament. It is historically linked to both the [[PvdA|Labour Party]] and the [[Christian Democratic Appeal]].

==Party History==
Between 1894 and 1901 [[Andries Staalman]] was a member of the [[Tweede Kamer]] for the district of [[Den Helder]]. He was a member of the main [[Reformed Churches in the Netherlands|Reformed]] party, the [[Anti Revolutionary Party]] (ARP). He operated on the left of the ARP and he advocated increased [[mixed economy|government interference in the economy]] and the [[universal suffrage|extension of suffrage]]. In [[Dutch general election, 1901|1901]] Staalman was re-elected into the Tweede Kamer on an Anti Revolutionary Ticket, but he was dissatisfied by the conservative course of the ARP. Staalman therefore sat as an independent Anti Revolutionary. He was dissatisfied by the conservative composition and program of the cabinet [[Abraham Kuyper]] had formed after the elections and did not support it.

Before the elections [[Dutch general election, 1905|1905]] Staalman founded his own party the Christian Democratic Party to enter in the elections. He was unable to win a seat. Between 1909 and 1917 Staalman entered in several other elections. In [[Dutch general election, 1917|1917]] Staalman was closely defeated by [[Pieter Oud]] for the Den Helder seat. In the [[Dutch general election, 1918|1918 elections]], the first election with a system of [[proportional representation]] and male [[universal suffrage]] the restriction to get into the Tweede Kamer were relatively low, one needed more than half of a percentage of the vote to be elected. Consequently the CDP was elected with only 10,000 votes (that is .8% of vote). Staalman played only a minor role in parliament.

In the [[Dutch general elections, 1922|1922 elections]] the restrictions to enter parliament where highered. The CDP was unable to maintain its seat. The CDP also entered in the [[Dutch general election, 1925|1925 elections]] without result. The party fell apart, some members returned to the [[Anti Revolutionary Party]] while others joined the newly founded [[Christian Democratic Union (Netherlands)|Christian Democratic Union]] together with former members of the [[Christian Social Party (Netherlands)|Christian Social Party]] and the [[League of Christian Socialists]].

==Ideology & Issues==
The CDP was a [[Christian left|leftwing christian democratic party]]. It was a [[reformist]] and rejected both [[class conflict]] and the privileged position of some classes over others. Unlike the ARP it did not reject cooperation with non-religious parties.

It had a traditional leftwing program, involving the extension of suffrage to all [[Householder Suffrage|householders]], the implementation of mandetory insurance against sickness and invalidity (an early form of the [[welfare state]]), [[progressive taxation]] and stronger rights for workers.
