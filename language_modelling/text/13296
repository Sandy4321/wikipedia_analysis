'''Kevin Lee Grady, Jr.''' (born June 24, 1986) is a free agent [[American football]] [[running back]] last played with the [[Chicago Slaughter]] of the [[Indoor Football League]] for their [[2011 Indoor Football League season|2011 season]]. He completed his athletic eligibility for the [[Michigan Wolverines football]] team during the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season]]. He began his Michigan career as a [[tailback]] but was converted to [[fullback (American football)|fullback]].  Starting on May 11, 2011 he began serving a 20-day jail sentence for a second [[drunk driving]] offense, which resulted in him becoming a free agent from the Slaughter.

In high school, he led his team to consecutive [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] Championships.  Along the way, he established numerous [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] career football rushing records while playing for [[East Grand Rapids High School]], many of which still stand.  He was also widely-regarded as the best junior class high school football player in the nation during the 2003 [[high school football]] season.  

At the [[University of Michigan]], he became the school's first athlete to graduate high school a semester early in order to participate in Spring football practice.  He was [[Mike Hart (American football)|Mike Hart]]'s backup at tailback during his first two years at Michigan. He missed his third year due to injury and returned to play fullback during his final two years of eligibility.
