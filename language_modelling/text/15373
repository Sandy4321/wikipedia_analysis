The name, Corsola, is probably a portmanteau of the words "coral" and "solar". The origin of "-sola" is evident in the fact that Corsola is attracted to the sun, habitates in warm waters, and that the branches on its head reflect the sun's colors. Corsola's Japanese name, Sanigo, is also a portmanteau of "Sango" (<U+3055><U+3093><U+3054>) which means coral, and the Japanese pronunciation of the word "sunny" (<U+30B5><U+30CB><U+30FC>) which is romanized as "san<U+012B>".

==Biological Characteristics==
Corsola is a marine creature composed mostly of a pink substance similar to real [[Coral Reef|coral]]. It has a small face and a white underbelly. In addition to the coral outgrowths (also described as branches) situated all over the upper half of its body, Corsola also has a growth like a horn on its head, and that is considered its natural armament when facing underwater predators.

The coral flesh of Corsola is continually shed as the Pok<U+00E9>mon grows. The branches serve to supply Corsola with nutrients by absorbing them from wherever there is clean water. Corsola<U+2019>s branches, when the Pok<U+00E9>mon is beached ashore, glitters beautifully in seven colors of the rainbow when they catch the sunlight. The branches are amazingly expendable; If any branch breaks off, Corsola can grow it back over the period of one night (compare with [[Staryu]]). However, this fragility is undermined by Corsola<U+2019>s inability to live in polluted water. If the sea is polluted, Corsola<U+2019>s branches become discolored and soon crumble away, where soon after the Pok<U+00E9>mon will die.

Corsola is a Pok<U+00E9>mon with a migratory life cycle. It prefers to live wherever the seas are warm. Thus it is a common sight near the shorelines whenever the Summer season befalls a region. When Corsola are in the northern seas during the summer in the northern hemisphere, once winter approaches, they migrate back en masse to the southern seas where it is now the summer for the southern hemisphere. Wherever it resides, countless Corsola blanket the shallow ocean floor, and their makeshift reef can serve as an ideal hiding place for other small Pok<U+00E9>mon, particularly the pink heart-like [[Luvdisc]].

Corsola plays an interesting supportive role in southern regions inhabited by humans. In south sea nations, people live in communities that have been built on groups of these Pok<U+00E9>mon. The most famous example of this is in the southern nation of [[Hoenn]], where the wooden, boarded town of Pacifidlog has been built far offshore and now floats on a huge colony of Corsola.

Due to its location in the Johto Pok<U+00E9>dex, there was some initial debate that it evolved into [[Remoraid]]. This seems perfectly plausible at first, because Remoraid shows no resemblance with its next stage [[Octillery]], just like Corsola shows no relation to Remoraid.

==In the Pok<U+00E9>mon video games==
In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gold and Silver|Gold/Silver]]/[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Crystal|Crystal]], it is found when fishing in The [[Cerulean City]] Gym, [[Cherrygrove City]], [[Cianwood City]], [[Olivine City]], [[List of Johto Locations#Union Cave|Union Cave]] and Routes 19, 34 and 40.

In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], the player can fish for it near the entrance to [[Ever Grande City]]. A more wasteful method of obtaining it is trading away a [[Bellossom]] in [[Pacifidlog Town]], because the existence of Bellossom depends on a Sun Stone which is very rare. In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]], it can be found on Route 128 and in [[Ever Grande City]] using a super rod.

Corsola's stats are all mediocre or below-average, but its decent Defense, Special Defense, and Hit Points let it take at least a few hits before fainting. On the plus side, it can learn Mirror Coat, useful against opponents with Special attacks. On the negative side, its dual Water/Rock type makes it very weak when facing Grass-types.

Though it's stats aren't the greatest for battling, Corsola really shines when it comes to breeding, allowing a lot of Pok<U+00E9>mon to learn Mirror Coat and Ancient Power easily.

==In other media==
[[Misty (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Misty]] caught a Corsola in Pok<U+00E9>mon Master Quest episode "A Corsola Caper", and has owned it ever since. It almost immediately became Misty's primary battling Pok<U+00E9>mon, displaying surprisingly strong offensive abilities (in one case, knocking out a [[Gyarados]] with a single attack) in addition to the defensive power for which the species is best known. Among its achievements was winning the Tour de Altomare race in the beginning of the movie ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Heroes]]''.

Corsola has appeared on four cards in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]], all as Basic water-types in the following sets: Neo Discovery, Expedition, EX Hidden Legends and EX Unseen Forces.
