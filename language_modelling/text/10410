'''''Pachylemur''''' is an [[Subfossil lemur|extinct, giant lemur]] most closely related to the [[ruffed lemur]]s of [[genus]] ''Varecia''.  Two species are known, ''Pachylemur insignis'' and ''Pachylemur jullyi'', although there is some doubt as to whether or not they may actually be the same species.  ''Pachylemur'' is sometimes referred to as the '''giant ruffed lemur''', because although it and the living ruffed lemurs had similar teeth and skeletons, ''Pachylemur'' was more robust and as much as three to four times larger.  [[Molecular phylogenetics|DNA studies]] have confirmed a [[sister group]] relationship between these two types of [[lemur]].  Like living ruffed lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' specialized in eating fruit, and was therefore an important [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]], possibly for tree species with seeds too large for even ruffed lemurs to swallow.  In the [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny thickets]] of southwestern [[Madagascar]], they were also likely to have dispersed seeds evolved to attach to fur and be carried away.  Unlike ruffed lemurs, the fore- and hindlimbs of ''Pachylemur'' were nearly the same length, and therefore it was likely to be a slow, deliberate climber.  However, both used [[Suspensory behavior|hindlimb suspension]] to reach fruit on small branches below them.

Like other lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' was only found on the island of Madagascar, and its [[subfossil]] remains have been found primarily at sites in the central and southwestern parts of the island.  Fragmentary and indeterminate remains have also been found in northern Madagascar.  ''Pachylemur'' once lived in diverse lemur [[Community (ecology)|communities]] within its range, but in many of these locations, 20% or fewer of the original lemur species remain.  ''Pachylemur'' went into decline following the arrival of humans in Madagascar around 350 [[Common Era|BCE]].  [[Habitat loss]], [[forest fragmentation]], and [[bushmeat]] hunting are thought to have been the reasons for its disappearance.  ''Pachylemur'' is thought to have gone [[Extinction|extinct]] between 680<U+2013>960 [[Common Era|CE]], although subfossil remains found in a cave pit in southwestern Madagascar may indicate that it survived up until 500 years ago.

''Pachylemur'' remains were first described in 1895 by French zoologist [[Henri Filhol]] and were originally included in the genus ''Lemur'', along with the [[ring-tailed lemur]] and other close relatives currently classified within the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Lemuridae]].  In 1948, French [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Charles Lamberton]] placed the species in the [[subgenus]] ''Pachylemur'', which was recognized as a genus by 1979.  However, due to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|earlier uses]] of the name ''Pachylemur'', the [[Principle of Priority|priority]] of an alternative genus name proposed by [[Guillaume Grandidier]] in 1905, and errors in Lamberton's 1948 description of the genus, the [[Available name|availability]] of the name under the rules of [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]] was considered questionable.  In 2011, a petition was filed with the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to preserve the name.

== Evolutionary history ==
''Pachylemur'' was similar to but significantly larger and more robust than living [[ruffed lemur]]s ([[genus]] ''Varecia'').{{LoM3 Sfn|p=35}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=114}}  In addition to their general [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], studies of their teeth ([[dental anatomy]]) also suggest a close relation.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}  In 1953, [[William Charles Osman Hill]] noted that the skull of both ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' and ''P.&nbsp;jullyi'' (then called ''Lemur insignis'' and ''L.&nbsp;jullyi'') resembled that of ruffed lemurs more so than the rest of the [[Lemuridae|lemurs classified in the genus ''Lemur'']] at that time.{{Sfn|Crovella|Montagnon|Rakotosamimanana|Rumpler|1994|p=519}}

Because of the similarities, ''Pachylemur'' is sometimes referred to as a giant ruffed lemur.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=43}}  In addition to the morphological similarities, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular studies]] also support a close relationship.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}  Based on studies of their [[DNA]], ''Pachylemur'' and ruffed lemurs form the [[sister group]] relative to the rest of the lemurs in the family [[Lemuridae]].  This sister group itself forms a sister group with the [[clade]] (related group) containing [[True lemur|brown lemurs]] (''Eulemur''), the [[ring-tailed lemur]] (''Lemur''), the [[greater bamboo lemur]] (''Prolemur''), and the lesser [[bamboo lemur]]s (''Hapalemur'').{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=354}}

=== Taxonomic classification ===
French zoologist [[Henri Filhol]] was the first to scientifically describe a species of ''Pachylemur''; he named ''Lemur insignis'' and ''Lemur intermedius'' in 1895 on the basis of a few [[subfossil]] bones.{{Sfn|Filhol|1895|p=12}} Descriptions of other species now placed in ''Pachylemur'' quickly followed. In 1899, [[Guillaume Grandidier]] named a new [[genus]] and species, ''Palaeochirogalus jullyi'',{{efn|Spelling corrected by {{Harvnb|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=276}}.}} on the basis of two teeth from [[Antsirabe]], central Madagascar, which he thought similar to [[dwarf lemur]]s (''Cheirogaleus'').{{Sfn|Grandidier|1899|p=345}} In 1903, [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] placed this species in the genus ''Lemur'' (as ''Lemur jullyi''),{{Sfn|Smith|1903|p=337}} and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''Lemur insignis''.{{Sfn|Grandidier|1905|p=78}}

Meanwhile, in 1904, [[Herbert F. Standing]] had named a different species using the same name, ''Lemur jullyi'',{{Sfn|Standing|1904|p=306}} and named another species ''Lemur maziensis''.{{Sfn|Standing|1904|p=309}} He noted similarities between this group and the ruffed lemurs, then considered a single species, ''Lemur varius''.{{Sfn|Standing|1904|p=305}} In 1908, Standing named another species in the group, ''Lemur majori'',{{Sfn|Standing|1908|p=119}} and included his ''Lemur maziensis'' in ''L.&nbsp;jullyi''.{{Sfn|Standing|1908|p=121}} The name ''Pachylemur'' was introduced for these animals in 1948 by [[Charles Lamberton]], who grouped ''Lemur insignis'', ''Lemur majori'', and ''Lemur jullyi'' in a [[subgenus]] of the genus ''Lemur''.{{Sfn|Lamberton|1948|p=7}}

Since 1979, ''Pachylemur'' has generally been regarded as a distinct genus, but some classifications include the genus in ''Lemur'' or the ruffed lemur genus ''Varecia''.{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=277}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=105}} In a 1982 review, [[Ian Tattersall]] recognized two species, ''Lemur insignis'' and ''Lemur jullyi''. He did not regard ''Pachylemur'' as a distinct genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, ''Lemur jullyi'' Standing, 1904, is [[preoccupied name|preoccupied]] by ''Palaeochirogalus jullyi'' Grandidier, 1899, and thus [[valid name (zoology)|invalid]]. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they belong to the same species, which he could continue to call ''Lemur jullyi''.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=240<U+2013>241}} Recent classifications recognize ''Pachylemur'' as a valid genus with two species<U+2014>''P.&nbsp;insignis'' (Filhol, 1895) and ''P.&nbsp;jullyi'' (Grandidier, 1899)<U+2014>but express doubt about the distinction between the two species.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=277}}

There are several [[nomenclature|nomenclatural]] problems with the current use of the name ''Pachylemur''.{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011}} First, Filhol had himself used the name ''Pachylemur'' in 1874 for a group of primitive primates, including ''[[Adapis]]'', that he considered intermediate between [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]s and lemurs.{{Sfn|Filhol|1874|p=18}} Several other authors mentioned this name in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it is questionable that any rendered the name [[available name|available]] under the rules of [[zoological nomenclature]].{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|pp=275<U+2013>276}} Still, this name potentially renders ''Pachylemur'' Lamberton, 1948, unavailable under the [[Principle of Homonymy]].{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=277}} In addition, the generic name ''Palaeochirogalus'' Grandidier, 1899, predates ''Pachylemur'' Lamberton, 1948, by half a century and thus takes precedence under the [[Principle of Priority]], and ''Pachylemur'' Lamberton is itself unavailable because Lamberton failed to select a [[type species]].{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|pp=276<U+2013>277}} To conserve the name ''Pachylemur'', Jelle Zijlstra, [[Colin Groves]], and Alex Dunkel submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] in 2011.{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=275}} The petition asks the Commission to suppress the names ''Pachylemur'' Filhol, 1874, ''Pachylemur'' Palmer, 1904 (based on Filhol's name), and ''Palaeochirogalus'' Grandidier, 1899, and to make ''Pachylemur'' Lamberton, 1948, retroactively available with ''Lemur insignis'' as its type species.{{Sfn|Zijlstra|Groves|Dunkel|2011|p=278}}

== Anatomy and physiology ==
''Pachylemur'' resembled the living ruffed lemurs but was three or four times larger, with an estimated body mass of {{convert|10|kg|abbr=on}} for ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' and {{convert|13|kg|abbr=on}} for the larger ''P.&nbsp;jullyi''.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=106|loc=table 7.1}} In addition, the skeleton is more robust.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}

[[File:Pachylemur insignis skull 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Right profile view of a ''Pachylemur insignis'' skull|The skull and teeth of ''Pachylemur insignis'' suggest that it ate mostly fruit and some leaves.]]
The [[dental formula]] is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.3.3|lower=2.1.3.3}}, as in all [[Lemuridae|lemurids]]. The [[toothcomb]]<U+2014>a comblike structure formed by the lower front teeth, characteristic of lemurs and [[Lorisoidea|lorisoids]]<U+2014>is similar to that of other lemurids. The two halves of the [[mandible]] (lower jaw) do not fuse at the [[mandibular symphysis]].{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}} However, there are some differences in tooth morphology from the living brown and ring-tailed lemurs, similar to those between the ruffed lemurs and the other genera. In ''Pachylemur'', the [[talonid]] basin (a basin at the back end of the lower [[molar (tooth)|molars]]) is more elongate, and it is not lined by an [[entoconid]] cusp. In the first two upper molars, the [[lingual cingulum]] (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) is expanded towards the front.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=114}} The two species differ in details of tooth morphology. ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' had narrower lower [[premolar]]s and molars, and the buccal (outer) cusps on these teeth are located to the front of their lingual counterparts.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}} Relative to the ruffed lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' has more massive jaws and larger molars.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=114}}

The skull of ''Pachylemur'' is relatively broad, but the [[orbit]]s (eye sockets) are smaller and oriented more towards the front than in the ruffed lemurs.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=114}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}} In the [[Postcrania|postcranial skeleton]], the most distinctive traits of ''Pachylemur'' are found. It had shorter and more robust limbs than the ruffed lemurs, and the fore- and hindlimbs were closer in length ([[intermembral index]] of approximately 97).{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=361}}

Compared to the [[axial skeleton]] of ruffed lemurs, the vertebrae of ''Pachylemur'' had shorter [[Body of vertebra|vertebral bodies]] and the [[spinous process]] had less anticliny.  The [[Femur head|head of its femur]] (thigh bone) was also relatively large.{{Sfn|Jungers|Godfrey|Simons|Wunderlich|2001|pp=391<U+2013>392}}  As of 2001, no bones of the [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] had been found for either species.{{Sfn|Jungers|Godfrey|Simons|Wunderlich|2001|p=394}}

== Behavior ==
Based on dental wear and the presence of [[dental caries]],{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|pp=361<U+2013>362}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=50}} ''Pachylemur'' was likely a [[Frugivore|fruit specialist]], just like the closely related ruffed lemurs,{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|pp=361<U+2013>362}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=57}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2003|p=1249}} but unlike most of the other [[Folivore|leaf-eating]], [[Subfossil lemur|extinct, giant lemurs]] of Madagascar.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=50}}  Although it primarily ate fruit, it may have supplemented its diet with leaves and other foliage seasonally.{{Sfn|Jungers|Godfrey|Simons|Wunderlich|2001|p=387}}  Its teeth were similar in appearance to that of ruffed lemurs, while its [[Molar (tooth)|molars]] and uneven dental wear suggest that it ate fewer leaves and more hard fruits and stems than today's brown lemur species.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|pp=361<U+2013>362}}

[[File:Baobab 04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adansonia|Baobabs]] in the [[Madagascar spiny thickets]] may have once relied on ''Pachylemur'' to distribute its large seeds.]]
Because it ate larger, harder, more fibrous fruits than ruffed lemurs,{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|p=77}} ''Pachylemur'' was likely an important [[Seed dispersal|seed disperser]] compared to the more folivorous extinct giant lemurs.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|pp=361<U+2013>362}}  Within the [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny thickets]] of southwest Madagascar, only ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' and ''[[Archaeolemur|Archaeolemur majori]]'', a type of extinct [[monkey lemur]], are suspected of having been large-seed dispersers, particularly for plants that use a form of [[photosynthesis]] known as [[C3 carbon fixation|C<sub>3</sub> carbon fixation]].{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=31}}  The plants that may have depended on these giant extinct lemurs include ''[[Adansonia]]'' (baobabs), ''[[Cedrelopsis]]'', ''[[Commiphora]]'', ''[[Delonix]]'', ''[[Diospyros]]'', ''[[Grewia]]'', ''[[Pachypodium]]'', ''[[Salvadora (plant genus)|Salvadora]]'', ''[[Strychnos]]'', ''[[Tamarind]]us'', and ''[[Uncarina]]''.{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=33}}

[[File:Uncarina roeoesliana seed 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Pachylemur'' may have spread seeds of plants like ''[[Uncarina roeoesliana]]'' by carrying them on their fur.]]
[[Black-and-white ruffed lemur]]s can swallow seeds with a diameter up to {{convert|sp=us|30|mm|in}}, which is larger than any other living lemur.  Having been more than twice as large, ''Pachylemur'' would have been capable of swallowing even larger seeds.{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=34}}  In the case of baobabs, the fruits have large seeds surrounded by a nutritious pulp and may have required [[Seed dispersal#Dispersal by animals|seed dispersal through ingestion]].{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=33}}  In western Madagascar, the [[genetic diversity]] of ''[[Commiphora guillaminii]]'' suggests it had more widespread seed dispersal in the past, but today shows signs of more localized diversity when compared to African [[Conspecificity|species within the same genus]] that have not lost their seed dispersers.{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=34}}

Many small trees and shrubs in the spiny thickets, such as [[endemism|endemic]] ''Uncarina'', conserve water by producing seeds with hooks and spines rather than fleshy fruits.  These seeds attach themselves to the skin and fur of passing animals for dispersal, and are still dispersed by living lemur species as well as [[introduced species]] such as cattle.  ''Pachylemur'' may also have helped disperse seeds in this fashion.{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|pp=33<U+2013>34}}

For many years, [[Paleoanthropology|palaeoanthropologists]] thought that ''Pachylemur'' was a [[Terrestrial animal|ground-dwelling]] lemur due to its robust [[Postcrania|postcranial skeleton]].{{LoM3 Sfn|p=35}}  Yet more recent analysis of its axial and [[appendicular skeleton]]<U+2014>particularly the vertebrae and femur<U+2014>suggests that it was a tree-dweller ([[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]]).{{LoM3 Sfn|p=35}}{{Sfn|Jungers|Godfrey|Simons|Wunderlich|2001|pp=391<U+2013>392}}  Like the ruffed lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' was also an arboreal [[Quadrupedalism|quadruped]] that frequently exhibited [[Suspensory behavior|hindlimb suspension]] in order to reach fruit and leaves on smaller branches.  However, ''Pachylemur'' was a slow, deliberate climber unlike the ruffed lemurs, which leap and bound through the upper [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]].{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2003|p=1248}}{{Sfn|Simons|1997|p=148}}  Like the both living lemurs and extinct lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' likely conserved energy because of its diet, small brain, and slow climbing.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=57}}

Because its eyes were comparable in size to those of modern day-living ([[Diurnality|diurnal]]) lemurs, ''Pachylemur'' was probably diurnal as well, as were most of the giant, extinct lemurs.  However, compared to similarly sized [[Simian|anthropoid]] primates, its [[visual acuity]] was relatively poor.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Schwartz|2006|p=53}}

== Distribution and habitat ==
The subfossil remains of ''Pachylemur'' have been found in all [[Ecoregions of Madagascar|regions of Madagascar]],{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Reed|Simons|1997|p=236}} except in the [[Madagascar lowland forests|eastern rainforests]] where no [[List of subfossil sites in Madagascar|subfossil sites]] are known.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=117}}  The two species are typically found in the [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny thickets]] and [[Madagascar succulent woodlands|succulent woodlands]] of southern/southwestern Madagascar (''P.&nbsp;insignis'') and the [[Madagascar subhumid forests|subhumid forests]] of the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|central highlands]] (''P.&nbsp;jullyi''), although other indeterminate or fragmentary remains have been discovered at Ankilitelo Cave in southwestern Madagascar,{{Sfn|Muldoon|2010|p=343}} as well as in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forests]] at [[Amparihingidro]] in the northwest (possibly ''P.&nbsp;insignis'') and [[Ankarana Reserve|Ankarana]] in the northern tip of the island (possibly ''P.&nbsp;jullyi'').{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=354, 361}}

Subfossil sites with ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' include [[Andolonomby]],{{Sfn|Crowley|Godfrey|Irwin|2011|p=28}} Beloha (near [[Anavoha]]), [[Bemafandry]], [[Andrahomana]], [[Manombo-Toliara]], [[Ambolisatra]], [[Ambararata-Mahabo]], [[Ampoza-Ankazoabo]], [[Belo-sur-mer]], [[Lamboharana]],  [[Taolambiby]], [[Tsiandroina]], and [[Tsirave]] in south and southwestern Madagascar.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=354}} ''P.&nbsp;jullyi'' has been recorded at [[Ampasambazimba]], [[Antsirabe]], and [[Morarano-Betafo]] in the central highlands of Madagascar.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=354}}

In general, lemur diversity has declined since the arrival of humans due to [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]], [[forest fragmentation]], and [[bushmeat]] hunting.  At some subfossil sites, ''Pachylemur'' lived alongside as many as 19 or 20 other lemur species, but now as few as 20% of those species remain in those areas.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|pp=117<U+2013>118}}

== Extinction ==
{{Details|Subfossil lemur#Extinction|subfossil lemur extinction}}
Humans arrived in Madagascar around 350&nbsp;[[Common Era|BCE]], but did not cause the extinction of ''Pachylemur'' and the other giant lemurs immediately.  Instead, many human-related factors, such as habitat loss, forest fragmentation, bushmeat hunting, and the introduction of invasive species, along with the gradual desiccation of certain parts of the island, caused their decline and eventual extinction over more than a millennium.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=363}}  The same factors threaten all [[List of lemur species|living lemur species]] today.{{Sfn|Crowley|2010|p=2601}}

The initial decline of ''Pachylemur'' began within 500&nbsp;years of human colonization, but prior to the establishment of large human settlements.  Hunting in the Central Highlands and the spiny thickets likely caused a substantial drop in its population.{{Sfn|Crowley|2010|p=2601}}  Large lemurs, including ''Pachylemur'', survived in the Central Highlands, succulent woodlands, and spiny thickets until around 950&nbsp;CE.{{Sfn|Crowley|2010|p=2601}}{{Sfn|Burney|Burney|Godfrey|Jungers|2004|p=38}}   Based on [[radiocarbon dating]] of subfossil remains collected as of 2010, the most recent remains of ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' out of 17&nbsp;dated specimens came from Ankilibehandry in the succulent woodlands and dated between 680 and 780&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]].  Of eight dated specimens, the most recent remains of ''P.&nbsp;jullyi'' came from Ampasambazimba in the Central Highlands and dated between 620 to 680&nbsp;CE.{{Sfn|Crowley|2010|loc=Supp. data}}  ''Pachylemur'' is generally thought to have gone extinct between 680<U+2013>960&nbsp;CE,{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=354, 361}} but remains of ''P.&nbsp;insignis'' have been found in Ankilitelo Cave (a pit cave in southwestern Madagascar), which is assumed to be less than 500&nbsp;years old.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Rasoazanabary|2011|p=171<U+2013>172}}
