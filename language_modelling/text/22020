"'''Audience'''" is a song recorded by Japanese recording artist [[Ayumi Hamasaki]], released on November 1, 2000 from her third studio album ''[[Duty (album)|Duty]]'' (2000). The song was written by Hamasaki herself, while [[Max Matsuura]] produced the track and [[Dai Nagao]] handled the composition. With two versions of the songs release, the single version of "Audience" made an appearance on her deluxe edition off her 2006 [[greatest hits]] compilation album ''[[A Best 2]]'', her 2008 compilation ''[[A Complete: All Singles]]'' and her 2012 compilation ''[[A Summer Best]]''.

After the big success of the previous singles, Hamasaki decided to released "Audience" as an limited edition single and restricted the unit limit in Japan. This was her fourth single to do this, with "[[Appears]]", "[[Fly High (song)|Fly High]]" and "[[Kanariya]]". Musically, "Audience" is the only dance-oriented song on the album that features rock and disco influences. 

"Audience" received favorable reviews from most music critics, who had highlighted the track as an album standout and a career standout. The song peaked at number three on the Oricon Singles Chart, making it her second single to stall at the number and was certified Platinum by [[RIAJ]] in her native Japan. No music video was shot for the single, which became her first stand-alone single not to feature a music video. The song has been performed live on many of Hamasaki's domestic tours and [[a-nation]], including her ''[[Ayumi Hamasaki Dome Tour 2001 A]]'', ''[[Ayumi Hamasaki Asia Tour 2008: 10th Anniversary]]'' and her ''Ayumi Hamasaki 15th Anniversary Tour''.

==Background==
Ayumi Hamasaki released two studios inside the year 1999; ''[[A Song for <U+00D7><U+00D7>]]'' and ''[[Loveppears]]''. Despite commercial success, Japanese music critics were not highly commendable on the music. ''A Song for xx'' was not well-received from most music critics, where critics felt the effort was "unassuming" and felt the music was plainly "cautious [[pop rock]]."<ref>{{cite news | last= Walters| first =Barry | title =Turning (Japanese) Point | publisher =[[The Village Voice]] | date =March 5, 2002 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0209,168697,32804,22.html| accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref> The next album transitioned to strong dance music and achieved better reviews, with an editorial review at ''[[HMV]]'' commending the album.<ref>{{cite news | title =LOVEppers: Ayumi Hamasaki [CD] | publisher =[[HMV]]| date =March, 2007 | url = http://www.hmv.co.jp/artist_%E6%B5%9C%E5%B4%8E%E3%81%82%E3%82%86%E3%81%BF_000000000114881/item_LOVEppears_991717| accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Nevertheless, both albums sold over one million units in Japan and the first was certified million by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ); ''Loveppears'' sold over two million and was certified double million.{{efn|group=upper-alpha|''A Song for <U+00D7><U+00D7>'' received a 3<U+00D7> Platinum certification for 1,200,000 copies, however the 3<U+00D7> Platinum threshold was redefined as 750,000 copies in 2003.}}<ref name="RIAJ-may1999">{{cite journal |title=GOLD ALBUM <U+4ED6><U+8A8D><U+5B9A><U+4F5C><U+54C1> 1999<U+5E74>3<U+6708><U+5EA6> |trans_title=Gold Albums, and other certified works.

During the writing process off ''Duty'', Hamasaki said that it was "unnatural" and was constantly "nervous".<ref name="cawaii10th">{{cite journal | title=Ayu 10th Year Career Anniversary | journal=Cawaii|date=May 2008|pages=15, 18 |author=Tsuriya, Takako|language=ja}}</ref> Majority of the lyrical content featured feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities, aimed mostly towards her public image as an recording artist.<ref name="ayu"/> In contrast to "Audience", the trilogy singles focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics.<ref name="ayu">{{cite journal | title="Review of Ayu's Year 2000 & M". | journal=''J-Point''|date=December 22, 2000|pages=75 |author=Author, Unknown|language=ja}}</ref> 

In the lyrical content, the song features the English word "Yes".<ref name="audience"/> "Audience" became her third song and second song penned by her to have incorporated English-language lyrics after "[[Whatever (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Whatever]]" and b-side "Love: Since 1999".{{efn|group=upper-alpha|The exclamation "Yes" is commonly used in the English-language and alternative European-languages. Technically, "Yes" is spoken and written in an English format and has been listed in the 1913 Webster Dictionary, so it proves that "Audience" is her third song to use an English-language word.}} Despite this, "Whatever" only used the word "Wow" while "Love: Since 1999" was not written by Hamasaki and, like "Whatever", by only using a singular phrase, it does not count in using English-language conversation like she did in her 2002 album ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last=Takeuchi Cullen |first=Lisa | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover4.html | title=Empress of Pop |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate=March 31, 2008|page=4 | date=March 25, 2002 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080322074147/http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover4.html <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archivedate=March 22, 2008}}</ref>
