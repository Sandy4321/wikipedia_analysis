'''Yuri Sergeyevich Rytkheu''' ({{lang-ru| <U+042E><U+0301><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0421><U+0435><U+0440><U+0433><U+0435><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+0420><U+044B><U+0442><U+0445><U+044D><U+0301><U+0443>}}, March 8, 1930 [[Uelen]] &ndash; May 14, 2008,  [[Saint Petersburg]]) was a [[Chukchis|Chukchi]] writer, who wrote in both his native [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] and in [[Russian language|Russian]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Chukchi.html |title= Chukchi: 14. Cultural Heritage |accessdate=12 January 2009 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> He is considered to be the father of Chukchi literature.

== Biography ==
Yuri Rytkheu was born March 8, 1930 to a family of trappers and hunters. His birthplace, the [[Village#Russia|village]] of [[Uelen]], was then in the Chukotka District, [[Far Eastern Territory]], [[RSFSR]], [[USSR]]; it is now part of the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]. His grandfather was a [[Shamanism in Siberia|shaman]]. 

At birth, he was given the name <U+201D>Rytkheu<U+201D>, which means <U+201D>unknown<U+201D> in the [[Chukchi language]]{{citation}}. Since Soviet institutions did not recognize Chukchi names and the Chukchi do not commonly use surnames, in order to obtain his passport he used his first name as his surname and assumed the first name and [[patronymic]] of a Russian geologist he knew.<ref name=kolyma/>

Rytkheu graduated from the Soviet 7-year school in Uelen. He wanted to continue his education at the [[Institute of the Peoples of the North]], but was not selected to study there, because of his young age. Consequently, he decided to go to [[Leningrad]] on his own, to continue his study. This travel was delayed for several years. In order to earn money for this journey, the future writer took odd jobs; for instance, he worked on the seas and on geological expeditions and trapped animals, [[stevedore]]d at a [[hydrography]] base. Rytkheu moved to [[Anadyr (town)|Anadyr]] and enrolled in a [[vocational school]]. In 1947 he started writing articles for the Anadyr district-based magazine ''Soviet Chukotka'' (<U+0421><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0427><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0442><U+043A><U+0430>), which published his first stories and poems. In Anadyr, Rytkheu met the Leningrad-based scholar [[Pyotr Skorik]], who was leading a linguistic expedition in the area and who was responsible for helping the young writer move to Leningrad.<ref name=kolyma>[http://www.kolyma.ru/magadan/person/rithau.shtml Biography at kolyma.ru] {{ru icon}}</ref>

From 1949 until 1954 Rytkheu studied literature at [[Leningrad State University]]. He was only slightly older than 20 when his works started appearing in ''Young Leningrad'' (<U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0434><U+043E><U+0439> <U+041B><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+043D><U+0433><U+0440><U+0430><U+0434>), and then later on in other periodicals such as ''[[Ogonyok]]'', ''[[Young World]]'' (<U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0434><U+043E><U+0439> <U+043C><U+0438><U+0440>), ''[[The Far East]]'' (<U+0414><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0412><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A>) and ''[[Youth (newspaper)|Youth]]'' (<U+0421><U+043C><U+0435><U+043D><U+0430>). In 1953, the publishing company [[Young Guard (publisher)|Young Guard]] published his first collection of stories ''The People of Our Coast'' (<U+041B><U+044E><U+0434><U+0438> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0448><U+0435><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0431><U+0435><U+0440><U+0435><U+0433><U+0430>), in Russian. This book was later translated into Chukchi by A. Smolyana (<U+0410>. <U+0421><U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+044F><U+043D><U+0430>). While still a student, Rytkheu also translated the works of [[Pushkin]], [[Tolstoy]], [[Gorki]] and [[Tikhon Syomushkin]] into Chukchi. In 1954, Rytkheu was accepted into the [[USSR Union of Writers]].<ref name=kolyma/>

Upon graduating from Leningrad University, Rytkheu spent a few years living in [[Magadan]], working as a correspondent for the newspaper ''[[Magadanskaya Pravda]]''. After two years in Magadan, a collection short stories ''Chukotkan Saga'' (<U+0427><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0442><U+0441><U+043A><U+0430><U+044F> <U+0441><U+0430><U+0433><U+0430>) was published, and brought the writer recognition from both Soviet and foreign readers.<ref name=kolyma/>

After Magadan, he moved to Leningrad, where he spent the rest of his life. In 1967, Rytkheu joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]]. Rytkheu travelled extensively around the world on [[creative trip]]s and with cultural and goodwill visits. As Rytkheu spoke fluent English, he was invited to give lectures at American universities. He also worked with [[UNESCO]] for a time.

Rytkheu died in [[Saint Petersburg]] May 14, 2008, after a long battle with [[myeloma]].<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://nw.rian.ru/culture/20080514/81633521.html |title= <U+0418><U+0437><U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0447><U+0443><U+043A><U+043E><U+0442><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+043F><U+0438><U+0441><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+042E><U+0440><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0420><U+044B><U+0442><U+0445><U+044D><U+0443> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0432> <U+041F><U+0435><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440><U+0431><U+0443><U+0440><U+0433><U+0435>" Famous Chukchi author Yuri Rytkhau dead in St. Petersburg" |accessdate=12 January 2009 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> He is buried in Komorovskoe Cemetery near the grave of his wife.

==Works==
After the [[Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union#Dissolution_of_the_USSR|collapse of the Soviet Union]], his works were no longer published in the new post-Soviet states. Finding himself in a difficult position, he even said that he would emigrate to the [[United States]]. However, through [[Chinghiz Aitmatov]], he met with Swiss <!-- even though the Russian says, German, everywhere else says Swiss--> publisher Lucien Leitess who signed a contract to publish Rytkheu<U+2019>s works in German, and who would go on to become his literary agent. Rytkheu<U+2019>s works were introduced to readers in [[France]], [[Finland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Spain]], [[Japan]], and other countries. <U+0422>he German editions of his books have sold more than 250,000 copies and Swiss publisher [[Unionsverlag]] has published them in other European languages, as well. The situation in Russia, however, was quite the opposite since the time his book ''<U+041F><U+0443><U+0442><U+0435><U+0448><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0432> <U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0434><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0438>'' was published in 1991. Since the turn of the millennium, the Governor of Chukotka [[Roman Abramovich]] has sponsored the distribution of a small run of Rytkeu<U+2019>s works in Russia, approximately one a year, all of which are issued only in Chukotka.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.bigbook.ru/articles/detail.php?ID=1358 |title= <U+042E><U+0420><U+0418><U+0419> <U+0420><U+042B><U+0422><U+0425><U+042D><U+0423>: <U+0410><U+041D><U+0415><U+041A><U+0414><U+041E><U+0422><U+042B> <U+041F><U+0420><U+041E> <U+0427><U+0423><U+041A><U+0427><U+0423> <U+041D><U+0415><U+0421><U+041C><U+0415><U+0428><U+041D><U+042B><U+0415> |accessdate=12 January 2009 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref> The first of these books was a new work called ''In the Mirror of Forgetfulness'' (<U+0412> <U+0437><U+0435><U+0440><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435> <U+0437><U+0430><U+0431><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F>).

Rytkheu<U+2019>s works have been translated into numerous languages, including several national languages of the former USSR. In addition, the composer [[Eduard Artemyev]] set Rytkheu<U+2019>s poems to music in the 1985 vocal-instrumental suite ''The Warmth of the Earth'' (<U+0422><U+0435><U+043F><U+043B><U+043E> <U+0417><U+0435><U+043C><U+043B><U+0438>).

Only a few of his works have been translated into English, including his ''A Dream in Polar Fog'' ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0432> <U+043D><U+0430><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+0435> <U+0442><U+0443><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430>}}), originally published in 1970, which was published by Archipelago Books in 2005.

[[Colin Thubron]] summarized his career as follows:<blockquote>
For his earlier books, there are those who never forgave him. His slavish pursuit of the Party line and open repudiation of his people<U+2019>s traditions are embarrassingly manifest in works that celebrate the (nonexistent) transformation of his native Chukotka into a Soviet paradigm. ... But by the late 1970s, as the slow literary thaw continued, he started to write differently. Perhaps influenced by the ''derevenshchiki'', the <U+201C>village writers<U+201D> who turned for their values to the unspoiled countryside, he began to extol precisely the Chukchi oral culture that he had once repudiated.<ref>Colin Thubron, "[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/last-shaman/ The Last Shaman]" (review of Yuri Rytkheu, ''The Chukchi Bible'', Archipelago Books, 2009), ''The New York Review of Books'', Aug. 18, 2011, p. 56</ref>
