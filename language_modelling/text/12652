John Astley (1720 ''or'' 1724 - 1787) is linked with [[Dukinfield]], [[Greater Manchester]] and London, wher he studied with Reynolds under Hudson <ref name="rothgain"></ref>
Astley was the son of Dr Astley of Wem, Salop and was hired to paint Lady Dukinfield-Daniel, of Dukinfield.<br>
It is said that after painting her picture she told him<br>
 "that if he is pleased with the portrait he might have the original"<ref> Middleton,  Thomas : ''Annals of Hyde and District.'', page 327. Copyright Free pub http://www.archive.org/details/annalsofhydedist00middiala.</ref><br>
and soon after their meeting they were married.

Astley became the owner of the Dukinfield estates when Lady Dukinfield-Daniel passed away. Astley purchased a house in Pall Mall andMax Rothschild is quoted as saying of him in his book "Gainsborough",<br>
 "he (Gainsborough) very soon removed to Schomberg House in Pall Mall.<br>
    This house, which was built by the Duke of Schomberg towards the end of the<br>
  seventeenth century, was at this time the property of the eccentric and mediocre<br>
  painter John Astley, a fellow pupil with Reynolds under Hudson. He was a portrait<br>
  artist of some reknown, and mainly painted portraits."<ref name="rothgain"> {{cite web | url=http://www.archive.org/stream/gainsborough00rothiala/gainsborough00rothiala_djvu.txt | title= Copyright free complete text of Gainsborough by Max Rothschild  | date=1909 | publisher=[T.C. & E.C.
