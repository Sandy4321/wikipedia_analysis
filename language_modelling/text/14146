'''''In Praise of Learning''''' is an album by [[United Kingdom|British]] [[avant-rock]] [[Musical ensemble|groups]] [[Henry Cow]] and [[Slapp Happy]], recorded at [[Virgin Records]]' [[The Manor Studio|Manor studios]] in February and March 1975. It was the second of two collaborative albums by the two groups and was released in May 1975.

The album cover art work was by artist [[Ray Smith (artist)|Ray Smith]] and was the last of the three "paint socks" to feature on Henry Cow's albums.

==Content==
''In Praise of Learning'' was the most overtly political album Henry Cow ever made. Printed on the back of the album cover is filmmaker [[John Grierson]]'s quote "Art is not a mirror - it is a hammer", and the [[Tim Hodgkinson]] 16 minute composition "[[Living in the Heart of the Beast]]", augmented by [[Dagmar Krause]]'s [[Armageddon]]-like vocals, made it quite clear where Henry Cow's political aspirations lay. Krause's powerful voice had added a new dimension to their music. The album opener, "War" ([[Anthony Moore|Moore]]/[[Peter Blegvad|Blegvad]]) had been recorded the previous year during the making of the first Slapp Happy/Henry Cow collaborative album, ''[[Desperate Straights]]'' (1975). It was covered by [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] in 1993 for a BBC radio session and on ''[[Middle Class Revolt]]''.

"Living in the Heart of the Beast" began as an unfinished instrumental that Hodgkinson presented to the group, which was cut up and performed live in 1974 with improvisational sections added.<ref name=RoadVol1P12>Cutler 2009, vol. 1-5, p. 12.</ref> One such performance, ''Halsteren'' was recorded in [[Halsteren]] in September 1974, and appears in ''Volume 2: 1974-5'' of ''[[The 40th Anniversary Henry Cow Box Set]]'' (2009). After the merger with Slapp Happy, Hodgkinson commissioned Blegvad to write lyrics for the piece for Krause to sing. But after several attempts, Blegvad admitted that he was "out of [his] depth", and Hodgkinson wrote the lyrics himself.<ref name=RoadVol1P12/><ref>Cutler 2009, vol. 1-5, p. 39.</ref>

[[Chris Cutler]]'s lyrics on "Beautiful as the Moon - Terrible as an Army with Banners" were the first song texts he had written,<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.ccutler.com/ccutler/interviews/fiori.shtml |title=Chris Cutler interview |work=Chris Cutler homepage |accessdate=2007-11-15}} </ref> and the song was the first writing collaboration between Cutler and [[Fred Frith]] that later grew into [[Art Bears]]. The song also became the longest lasting "building block" the band used in subsequent live performances.<ref name=RoadVol1P12/>
