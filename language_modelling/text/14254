'''Etal Castle''' is a ruined [[Middle Ages|medieval]] fortification in the village of [[Etal]], [[Northumberland]], England. It was built around 1341 by Robert Manners, and comprised a residential tower, a [[gatehouse]] and a corner tower, protected by a [[Curtain wall (castle)|curtain wall]]. The castle was involved both in local [[feud]]ing and the [[Anglo-Scottish Wars|border wars]] between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King [[James IV of Scotland]] during his invasion of England. 

The castle passed into the hands of [[the Crown]] in 1547 and was garrisoned as part of the border defences, but fell into disrepair and was abandoned as a military fortification after 1603. In the 18th century it finally ceased to be used as a domestic dwelling and became ruinous. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the [[Baron Joicey|Joicey]] family, but managed by [[English Heritage]]. Open to the public, it is protected under UK law as an [[Scheduled Monument|ancient monument]] and a [[Listed building|Grade I listed building]].

==History==
===14th - 15th centuries===
Etal Castle was built around 1341 by Robert Manners in the village of [[Etal]], after Robert was granted a [[licence to crenellate]] by King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in order to defend the location against the Scots.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=91}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> The Manners family had owned the manor since at least 1242.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=17959&back=| title = Manners, Sir Robert (d. 1354) | author= W.

Work continued under Robert's son, John Manners, who inherited the property as a minor in 1354.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=17959&back=| title = Manners, Sir Robert (d. 1354) | author= W.

[[File:Etal Castle 20100922 gatehouse from west.jpg|thumb|The interior side of the gatehouse]]
John Manners died in 1402, probably leaving the castle to his son, Robert, who in turn left the property to his own son, another John Manners.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=449-450}}</ref> John was involved in a long-running feud with the neighbouring Heron family, who owned the neighbouring Ford Castle, and on 20 January 1428 there was a fight between the two sides outside Etal Castle, in which William Heron died.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=379-380}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=184}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}</ref> The precise events are unclear and formed the basis of a subsequent lawsuit, but John argued that William had assaulted the castle, during which attack he had died, with John having no direct involvement in his death; William's widow blamed John and his eldest son, also called John, for William's death and demanded compensation.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=380-381}}</ref> After arbitration by the Church, eventually John agreed to pay for 500 [[Mass (liturgy)|masses]] for William's soul, and to give 250 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] to his widow.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=381}}</ref> 

In 1438, another of John Manners' sons, Robert, inherited the castle and the estates.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=450}}</ref> The lands had fallen in value considerably over the preceeding years, as a result of the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=450}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=450-451}}</ref> George inherited the title of [[Baron de Ros]] from his mother's side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family around the end of the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=450-451}}</ref>

===16th - 16th centuries===
[[File:Etal Castle, Northumberland, by Girtin.png|thumb|[[Thomas Girtin]]'s 1797 painting of the castle]]
In the absence of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who gradually became the castle's hereditary constables, renting the [[demesne]] lands on the estate from the family as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=184}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=450-452, 461}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=461-462}}</ref> 

In August 1513, [[James IV of Scotland]] invaded England with a large army; equipped with modern artillery, he took the border castles of [[Norham Castle|Norham]] and [[Wark Castle|Wark]], and then moved south against Etal Castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodwin|2013|p=4}}</ref> Etal surrendered quickly in the hope of avoiding being pillaged by James' army, but nonetheless it was at least partially [[slighting|slighted]], being deliberately damaged to prevent it being used as a defence.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadler|Serdiville|2013|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Dodds|2005|p=109}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=462}}</ref> 

After the English victory at the [[Battle of Flodden]] the following month, the castle was retaken, garrisoned and used by [[Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre|Lord Dacre]] to store the captured Scottish artillery, under the guard of Sir Philip Tilney.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=462}}; {{harvnb|Goodwin|2013|p=209}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> Lord Dacre went on to use the castle extensively in 1515 and 1516.<ref name=Vickere1922P462>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=462}}</ref> In 1541, a royal commission reported that the castle and its buildings were "in very great decaye", recommending that the fortification should be repaired.<ref name=Vickere1922P462/>

[[The Crown]] bought the castle from the Manners in 1547 in exchange for other estates in England, putting Sir John Elleker in charge of the property, along with a garrison of 100 horsemen and 200 foot soldiers.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=461}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> Within two years, however, the Collingwoods were once more acting as the castle constables, a position they would retain for the rest of the century.<ref name=Vickere1922P462/> The castle remained important to the defence of the border but fell into in poor repair: in 1564 it was described as in poor condition, "scant able to lodge the captain"; in 1580 another report reiterated similar problems; and in 1584 commissioners wrote that the poor maintenance over many years had left it need of repairs in the order of <U+00A3>200.<ref name=Vickers1922P462ListEntry>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=462}}; {{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref>

===17th - 21st centuries===
In 1603 [[James VI of Scotland]] inherited the kingdom of England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private ownership.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> In the 18th century it ceased to be used as a residence, and the ruins were painted in [[watercolour]] by [[Thomas Girtin]] in 1797, based upon his visit to the castle in the autumn of 1796.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}; {{cite web| url = http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=744989&partId=1| title = Collection On-line | publisher = British Museum | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> 

[[James Joicey, 1st Baron Joicey|Lord Joicey]] bought the castle in 1908, and by 1922 the ruins had been cleaned of ivy and [[repointing|repointed]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=464}}</ref> The castle was placed into the guardianship of the state in 1975, and [[archaeological excavation]]s were carried out on the site in 1979, 1982 and 1994.<ref name=ListEntryPastscape>{{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}; {{cite web| url = http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=3641| title = Etal Castle | publisher = English Heritage/Pastscape | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> In the 21st century it is managed by [[English Heritage]], and protected under UK law as a [[Grade I listed building]] and as an [[Scheduled Monument|ancient monument]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1011644| title = List Entry | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}; {{cite web| url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/etal-castle/| title = Etal Castle | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:Plan of Etal Castle.png|thumb|Plan of the castle: A - corner tower; B - residential tower; C - bailey; D - gatehouse]]

Etal Castle originally overlooked a bridge over the [[River Till]], and was protected by the steep banks running to the river.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}; {{harvnb|Pettifer|2002|p=184}}</ref> The castle forms a rectangular enclosure, approximately {{convert|182|by|162|ft}}, protected by a well-made, but relatively thin, stone curtain wall, mostly {{convert|4|ft|6|in}} thick.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|pp=464, 469}}</ref> Most of the wall above ground has since been destroyed, with only the foundations remaining.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=469}}</ref> 

The residential tower in the north-east corner was entered by a forebuilding, unusual in this region, 17 feet 6 inches by 7 feet 10 inches (5.33 by 2.39 m) in size and protected by a [[portcullis]].<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=466}}</ref> Four storeys tall, each floor of the tower was reached by a [[spiral staircase]] and comprised two rooms, one large and one small chamber.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=91}}</ref> The tower is built from [[sandstone]]; the forebuilding and uppermost floor are made of a lighter sandstone than the lower floors and may have been added retrospectively.<ref name=Emery1996P92>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}</ref> The ground floor is {{convert|46|by|32|ft}} and originally had a vaulted ceiling.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=91}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=466}}</ref> The upper floors were well-lit with large [[Transom (architectural) |transomed windows]], complete with [[window seat]]s; the first and second floors were probably used by the Manners family and had large fireplaces, with the third floor used by the castle staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|pp=91-92}}</ref> The tower was possibly linked to a neighbouring hall complex by a doorway on the first floor, although any such complex has since been lost.<ref name=Emery1996P92/>  

The gatehouse in the south-east corner is {{convert|36|ft}} square, and its vaulted passageway was originally protected by a portcullis, gate and a [[drawbridge]].<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=468}}</ref> On either side of the passageway were two vaulted guardrooms, {{convert|21|ft}} long and up to {{convert|6|ft|8|in}} wide.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=464}}</ref> On the first floor, since lost, there was a large chamber, {{convert|22|by|19|ft}} wide, with an ancillary room, {{convert|7|ft|6|in}} square, and a doorway that led onto some form of forebuilding or platform.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=465}}</ref> The gatehouse has what architectural historian Anthony Emery has described as "flamboyant window tracing", and the Manners' [[coat of arms]] are carved above the entrance to the gatehouse.<ref>{{harvnb|Emery|1996|p=92}}; {{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=465}}</ref>

The north-west corner tower is 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an entrance door on the east side, and originally had a loft floor.<ref>{{harvnb|Vickers|1922|p=469}}; {{cite web| url = http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=3641| title = Etal Castle | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref> It remains uncertain if there was a second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=3641| title = Etal Castle | publisher = English Heritage | separator = ,| postscript = none| accessdate=10 October 2014 }}</ref>
