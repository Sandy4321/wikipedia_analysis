'''Paleolightning''' is the study of [[lightning]] activity throughout Earth<U+2019>s history.  Some studies have speculated that lightning activity played a crucial role in the development of not only Earth<U+2019>s early atmosphere, but also early life.  Lightning, a non-biological process, has been found to produce biologically useful material through the [[oxidation]] of inorganic matter.<ref name="miller">{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.|coauthors=H.

Gildor|title=The lightning-biota climatic feedback|journal=Global Change Biology|year=2007|volume=14|pages=440<U+2013>450}}</ref>  

Detecting lightning activity in the geologic record can be difficult, given the instantaneous nature of lightning strikes in general.  However, [[fulgurite]], a glassy, tube-like mineral that forms when lightning fuses quartz sands, is prevalent in electrically-active regions around the globe and provides evidence of not only past lightning activity, but also patterns of [[convection]].<ref name="spon93">{{cite journal|last=Sponholz|first=B.|coauthors=R. Baumhauer and P. Felix-Henningsen|title=Fulgurites in the southern Central Sahara, Republic of Niger, and their palaeoenvironmental significance|journal=The Holocene|year=1993|volume=3|pages=97<U+2013>104}}</ref>  Since lightning channels carry an [[electric current]] to the ground, lightning can produce [[magnetic fields]] as well.  While lightning-magnetic anomalies can provide evidence of lightning activity in a region, these anomalies are often problematic for those examining the magnetic record of rock types because they disguise the natural magnetic fields present.<ref name="maki05">{{cite journal|last=Maki|first=D.|title=Lightning strikes and prehistoric ovens: Determining the source of magnetic anomalies using techniques of environmental magnetism|journal=Geoarchaeology: An International Journal|year=2005|volume=20|pages=449<U+2013>459}}</ref>

==Lightning and early Earth==
	The atmospheric composition of [[early Earth]] (the first billion years) was drastically different than its current state.<ref name="cloud">{{cite journal|last=Cloud|first=P.|title=A working model of the primitive Earth|journal=American Journal of Science|year=1972|volume=272|pages=537<U+2013>548}}</ref>  Initially, [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] compounds dominated the [[atmosphere]].  However, given the relatively small size of these elements and the warmer temperature of [[Earth]] compared to other planets at the time, most of these lighter compounds escaped, leaving behind an [[atmosphere]] composed mainly of [[methane]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]] and [[ammonia]] with small concentrations of [[hydrogen]] compounds and other gases.<ref name="miller" />  The [[atmosphere]] was transitioning from a [[reducing atmosphere|reduction atmosphere]] (an atmosphere that inhibits oxidation) to one of [[oxidation]], similar to our current [[atmosphere]].<ref name="miller" />  The origin of life on [[Earth]] has been a matter of speculation for quite some time.  Living things did not spontaneously appear, so some sort of biological or even non-biological process must have been responsible for the generation of life.  Lightning is a non-biological process, and many have speculated that lightning was present on [[early Earth]].  One of the most famous studies that investigated lightning on the early Earth was the [[Miller-Urey experiment]].

===Miller-Urey experiment===
{{Main|Miller-Urey experiment}}
[[File:Miller-Urey experiment-en.svg|thumb|300px|Schematic diagram of the Miller-Urey experiment<ref>{{cite web|last=Mrabet|first=Yassine|title=Miller-Urey experiment (1953)|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Miller-Urey_experiment-en.svg|work=Own work|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>]]
The [[Miller-Urey experiment]] sought to recreate the [[early Earth]] [[atmosphere]] within a laboratory setting to determine the chemical processes that ultimately led to life on [[Earth]].<ref name="miller" />  The basis of this experiment was leveraged on Oparin<U+2019>s hypothesis, which assumed that some organic matter could be created from inorganic material given a [[reducing atmosphere|reduction atmosphere]].<ref name="miller" />  Using a mixture of [[water]], [[methane]], [[ammonia]], and [[hydrogen]] in glass tubes, Miller and Urey replicated the effects of lightning on the mixture using [[electrode]]s.<ref name="miller" />  At the conclusion of the experiment, as much as 15 percent of the carbon from the mixture formed organic compounds, while 2 percent of the carbon formed [[amino acid]]s, a necessary element for the building blocks of living organisms.<ref name="miller" />

===Volcanic lightning on early earth===
The actual composition of the [[atmosphere]] of the [[early Earth]] is an area of great debate.  Varying amounts of certain gaseous constituents can greatly impact the overall effect of a particular process, which includes non-biological processes such as the buildup of charge in [[thunderstorm]]s.  It has been argued that volcano-induced lightning in the early stages of Earth<U+2019>s existence, because the volcanic plume was composed of additional <U+201C>reducing gases<U+201D>, was more effective at stimulating the [[oxidation]] of organic material to accelerate the production of life.<ref name="hill">{{cite journal|last=Hill|first=R. D.|title=An efficient lightning energy source on the early Earth|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere|year=1992|volume=22|pages=227<U+2013>285}}</ref>  In the case of volcanic lightning, the lightning discharge almost exclusively occurs directly within the volcanic plume.<ref name="hill" />  Since this process occurs fairly close to ground level, it has been suggested that volcanic lightning contributed to the generation of life to a greater extent than lightning produced within clouds that would lower positive or negative charge from a cloud to the ground.<ref name="hill" />  Hill (1992) quantified this enhanced contribution by examining estimated [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN) concentrations from volcanic lightning and <U+201C>general lightning<U+201D>.<ref name="hill" />  Results showed that HCN concentrations for volcanic lightning were an order of magnitude larger than <U+201C>general lightning<U+201D>.<ref name="hill" />  [[Hydrogen cyanide]] is yet another compound that has been linked to the generation of life on [[Earth]].<ref name="matthews">{{cite journal|last=Matthews|first=C. N.|title=The HCN World: Establishing protein-nucleic augucid life via hydrogen cyanide polymers.  Cellular origin and life in extreme habitats and astrobiology|journal=Origins: Genesis, Evolution and Diversity of Life|year=2004|volume=6|pages=121<U+2013>135}}</ref>  However, given that the intensity and amount of volcanic activity during the early stages of Earth<U+2019>s development is not fully understood, hypotheses regarding past volcanic activity (e.g., Hill, 1992) are usually based on present-day observed volcanic activity.<ref name="hill" />

==Nitrogen fixation and lightning==
{{Main|Nitrogen Fixation}}
[[Nitrogen]], the most abundant gas in our [[atmosphere]], is crucial for life and a key component to various biological processes.  Biologically usable forms of [[nitrogen]], such as [[nitrate]]s and [[ammonia]], arise via biological and non-biological processes through [[nitrogen fixation]].<ref name="navarro01">{{cite journal|last=Navarro-Gonzalez|first=R.|coauthors=C. P. McKay and D. N. Mvondo|title=A possible nitrogen crisis for Archaean life due to reduced nitrogen fixation by lightning|journal=Nature|year=2001|volume=412|pages=61<U+2013>64|bibcode = 2001Natur.412...61N }}</ref>  One example of a non-biological process responsible for [[nitrogen fixation]] is lightning.  

Lightning strikes are short-lived, high-intensity electrical discharges that can reach temperatures five times hotter than the surface of the [[Sun]].  As a result, as a lightning channel travels through the air, [[ionization]] occurs, forming [[nitrogen oxide|nitrogen-oxide]] (NOx) compounds within the lightning channel.<ref name="shepon" />  Global NOx production as a result of lightning is around 1-20 Tg N yr-1.<ref name=labrador>{{cite journal|last=Labrador|first=L. J.|title=Sensitivity of tropospheric chemistry to the source of NOx from lightning: Simulations with the global 3-D chemical transport model MATCH-MPIC|journal=PhD Thesis, Air Chemistry Department, Max Planck Institute, Mainz, Germany|year=2005}}</ref>  Some studies have implied that lightning activity may be the <U+201C>greatest contributor to the global nitrogen budget<U+201D>, even larger than the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref name=liaw>{{cite journal|last=Liaw|first=Y. P.|coauthors=D. L. Sisterson and N. L. Miller|title=Comparison of field, laboratory, and theoretical estimates of global nitrogen fixation by lightning|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|year=1990|volume=95|pages=22489<U+2013>22494|bibcode = 1990JGR....9522489L |doi = 10.1029/JD095iD13p22489 }}</ref>  With anywhere between 1500 and 2000 [[thunderstorms]] and millions of lightning strikes occurring daily around the Earth, it is understandable that lightning activity plays a vital role in [[nitrogen fixation]].<ref name=macgorman>{{cite book|last=MacGorman|first=D. R.|coauthors=W. D. Rust|title=The Electrical Nature of Storms|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=432}}</ref>  While [[nitrogen oxide]] compounds are produced as a lightning channel travels toward the ground, some of those compounds are transferred to the [[geosphere]] via wet or dry [[deposition]].<ref name="shepon" />  Variations of [[nitrogen]] in terrestrial and oceanic environments impact [[primary production]] and other biological processes.<ref name="shepon" />  Changes in [[primary production]] can impact not only the [[carbon cycle]], but also the [[climate system]].

===The lightning-biota climatic feedback===
The lightning-biota climatic feedback (LBF) is a [[negative feedback]] response to [[global warming]] on a time scale of hundreds or thousands of years, as a result of increased concentrations of [[nitrogen]] compounds from lightning activity deposited into biological [[ecosystem]]s.<ref name="shepon" />  A zero-dimension Earth [[conceptual model]], which took into account global temperature, soil available [[nitrogen]], terrestrial vegetation, and global atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentration, was used to determine the response of global average temperatures to increased NOx concentrations from lightning strikes.<ref name="shepon" />  It was hypothesized that as a result of increasing global average temperatures, lightning production would increase because increased [[evaporation]] from oceans would promote enhanced [[convection]].  As a result of more numerous lightning strikes, [[nitrogen fixation]] would deposit more biologically useful forms of [[nitrogen]] into various [[ecosystem]]s, encouraging [[primary production]].  Impacts on [[primary production]] would affect the [[carbon cycle]], leading to a reduction in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].  A reduction in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] would result in a [[negative feedback]], or cooling, of the [[climate system]].<ref name="shepon" />  Model results indicated that, for the most part, the lightning-biota climatic feedback retarded positive perturbations in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] and temperature back to an <U+201C>equilibrium<U+201D> state.<ref name="shepon" />  Impacts of the lightning-biota climatic feedback on curbing [[anthropogenic]] influences on atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations were investigated as well.<ref name="shepon" />  Using current levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and rates of increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide on a yearly basis based on the time of the article, the lightning-biota climatic feedback once again showed a cooling effect on global average temperatures, given an initial perturbation.<ref name="shepon" />  Given the simplified nature of the model, several parameters ([[ozone]] produced by lightning, etc.) and other feedback mechanisms were neglected, so the significance of the results is still an area of discussion.<ref name="shepon" />

==Lightning in the geologic record==
Indicators of lightning activity in the geologic record are often difficult to decipher.  For example, [[fossil]] charcoals from the Late [[Triassic]] could potentially be the result of lightning-induced wildfires.<ref name=jones02>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=T. P.|coauthors=S. Ash and I. Figueiral|title=Late Triassic charcoal from Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona, USA|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|year=2002|volume=188|pages=127<U+2013>139}}</ref>  Even though lightning strikes are, for the most part, instantaneous events, evidence of lightning activity from past [[climate]] can be found in unique minerals called [[fulgurite]].

===Fulgurite===
{{Main|Fulgurite}}
[[File:Fulgurite.JPG|thumb|300px|Fulgurite sample (photograph from Mario Hendriks (2006)), illustrating its characteristic glassy, tube-like structure<ref>{{cite web|last=Hendriks|first=Mario|title=A Fulgurite from Okechoobee in Florida|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Fulgurite.JPG|work=Own work|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref>]]

Because lightning strikes are extremely hot, when lightning channels reach the ground, they can fuse quartz sands in the soil to create glassy, tube-like fragments known as fulgurite (fulgar in Latin means <U+201C>lightning<U+201D>).<ref name="spon93" />  Just as lightning strikes branch in various directions, fulgurite forms branch-like configurations, often following the characteristic shape of plant roots in the ground.<ref name="schonland">{{cite book|last=Schonland|first=B. F.|title=The Flight of Thunderbolts|year=1950|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=152}}</ref>  [[Fulgurite]] is important in the study of [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]] because they are an artifact of past lightning storms.<ref name="spon04">{{cite journal|last=Sponholz|first=B.|title=Fulgurites as paleoclimatic indicators:  New approaches on Holocene climatic change in the Sahara|journal=First Joint Meeting of IGCP 490 and ICSU: Environmental Catastrophes in Mauritania, the Desert and the Coast|date=January 4<U+2013>18, 2004|year=2004}}</ref>  Since [[fulgurite]] is of a glass-like structure, the fragments are brittle, and samples can vary in length and thickness, often as a result of their depositional environment.<ref name="spon04" />  For example, [[fulgurite]] found in the [[Saharan Desert]] was much smaller than [[fulgurite]] found near the [[Elbe River]] in [[Germany]] (20 centimeters versus several meters, respectively).<ref name="spon04" />  Most [[fulgurite]] is found in remnants of paleolakes and along slopes between depressions in [[dune]]s.<ref name="spon04" />  It has been suggested that these locations are prime for lightning activity because characteristically larger electric fields would have been present in these areas, which would enable positive leaders to stream vertically to meet the downward-propagating [[stepped leader]] more easily than other locations.<ref name="spon04" /> 
  
Fulgurites are often examined under polarized light for the purposes of distinguishing these fragments from other quartz sand structures.<ref name="spon04" />  An important distinction for fulgurite is the presence of [[Lechatelierite]].<ref name="spon04" />  Lechatelierite is an [[isotropic]] substance, so when this mineral is exposed to polarized light, the direction through which the light passes through Lechatelierite does not change; thus it is easily identifiable compared to other grains.<ref name="spon04" />  Lechatelierite is a brittle substance, so [[aeolian|eolian]] and depositional influences can impact the concentrations of Lechatelierite in fulgurite samples.<ref name="spon04" />  However, varying concentrations and distributions  allow for the analysis of climatic features of a region.<ref name="spon04" />

A fulgurite is indicative of [[thunderstorms]], so the distribution of fulgurites can hint at not only patterns of lightning strikes, but also the location of rainfall.  Sponholz et al. (1993) studied fulgurite distributions along a north-south cross section in the south central [[Saharan Desert]] ([[Niger]]).  The study found that newer fulgurite concentrations increased from north to south, which indicated not only a paleo-monsoon pattern, but also the demarcation for thunderstorms as they progressed from a northern line to a southern location over time.<ref name="spon93" />  By examining the outcrops in which the fulgurite samples were found, Sponholz et al. (1993) could provide a relative date for the minerals.  The fulgurite samples dated back approximately 15,000 years to the mid to upper [[Holocene]].<ref name="spon93" />  This finding was in agreement with the [[paleosol]]s of the region, as this period of the Holocene was particularly wet.<ref name="spon93" />  A wetter climate would suggest that the propensity for thunderstorms was probably elevated, which would result in larger concentrations of fulgurite.<ref name="spon93" />  These results pointed to the fact that the [[climate]] with which the fulgurite was formed was significantly different than the present climate because the current climate of the [[Saharan Desert]] is [[arid]].<ref name="spon93" />  The approximate age of the fulgurite was determined using [[thermoluminescence]] (TL).<ref name="navarro07">{{cite journal|last=Navarro-Gonzalez|first=R.|coauthors=S. A. Mahan, A. K. Singhvi,  R. Navarro-Aceves,  J. L. Rajot, C. P. McKay, P. Coll and F. Raulin|title=Paleoecology reconstruction from trapped gases in a fulgurite from the late Pleistocene of the Libyan Desert|journal=Geology|year=2007|volume=35|pages=171<U+2013>174|bibcode = 2007Geo....35..171N |doi = 10.1130/G23246A.1 }}</ref>  Quartz sands can be used to measure the amount of [[radiation]] exposure, so if the temperature at which the fulgurite was formed is known, one could determine the relative age of the mineral by examining the doses of [[radiation]] involved in the process.<ref name="spon93" /><ref name="navarro07" />    
    
Fulgurite also contains air bubbles.<ref name="spon93" />  Given that the formation of fulgurite generally takes only about one second, and that the process involved in the creation of fulgurite involves several chemical reactions, it is relatively easy to trap various gases, such as CO2, within the air bubbles of these minerals.<ref name="navarro07" />  These gases can be trapped for millions of years.<ref name="navarro07" />  Studies have shown that the gases within these bubbles can indicate the soil characteristics during the formation of the fulgurite material, which hint at the [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]].<ref name="navarro07" />  Since fulgurite is almost entirely composed of [[silicon dioxide|silica]] with trace amounts of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]], an approximation of the total amount of organic carbon associated with that lightning strike can be made to calculate a [[carbon-to-nitrogen ratio]] to determine the paleoenvironment.<ref name="navarro07" />

===Paleomagnetism===
{{Main|Paleomagnetism}}
When geologists study [[paleoclimatology|paleoclimate]], an important factor to examine is the magnetic field characteristics of rock types to determine not only deviations of Earth<U+2019>s past magnetic field, but also to study possible [[tectonic]] activity that might suggest certain [[climate]] regimes.  

Evidence of lightning activity can often be found in the [[paleomagnetism|paleomagnetic]] record.  Lightning strikes are the result of tremendous charge buildup in clouds.  This excess charge is transferred to the ground via lightning channels, which carry a strong [[electric current]].  Because of the intensity of this electric current, when lightning hits the ground, it can produce a strong, albeit brief, magnetic field.  Thus, as the electric current travels through soils, rocks, plant roots, etc., it locks a unique magnetic signature within these materials through a process known as lightning-induced remanent magnetization (LIRM).<ref name=graham>{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=K. W. T.|title=The re-magnetization of a surface outcrop by lightning currents.|journal=Geophys. J. Roy. Astron Soc|year=1961|volume=6|pages=85<U+2013>102}}</ref>  Evidence of LIRM is manifested in concentric magnetic field lines surrounding the location of the lightning strike point.<ref name="verrier">{{cite journal|last=Verrier|first=V.|coauthors=P. Rochette|title=Estimating peak currents at ground lightning impacts using remanent magnetization|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|year=2002|volume=29|doi=10.1029/2002GL015207|bibcode=2002GeoRL..29r..14V}}</ref>  LIRM anomalies normally occur close to the location of the lightning strike, usually encapsulated within several meters of the point of contact.<ref name=maki05 />  The anomalies are generally linear or radial, which, just like actual lightning channels, branch out from a central point.<ref name=jones05>{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=G.|coauthors=D. Maki|title=Lightning-induced magnetic anomalies on archaeological sites|journal=Archaeological Prospection|year=2005|volume=12|pages=191<U+2013>197}}</ref>  It is possible to determine the intensity of the electric current from a lightning strike by examining the LIRM signatures.<ref name="verrier" />  Since rocks and soils already have some preexisting magnetic field, the intensity of the electric current can be determined by examining the change between the <U+201C>natural<U+201D> magnetic field and the magnetic field induced by the lightning current, which generally acts parallel to the direction of the lightning channel.<ref name="verrier" />  Another characteristic feature of an LIRM anomaly compared to other magnetic anomalies is that the [[electric current]] intensity is generally stronger.<ref name="maki05" />  However, some have suggested that the anomalies, like other characteristics in the geologic record, might fade over time as the magnetic field redistributes.<ref name="jones05" />

LIRM anomalies can often be problematic when examining the magnetic characteristics of rock types.  LIRM anomalies can disguise the [[natural remanent magnetization]] (NRM) of the rocks in question because the subsequent magnetization caused by the lightning strike reconfigures the magnetic record.<ref name="maki05" />   While investigating the soil attributes at the 30-30 Winchester archeological site in northeastern Wyoming to discern the daily activities of prehistoric people that had once occupied that region, David Maki noticed peculiar anomalies in the magnetic record that did not match the circular magnetic remnant features of the ovens used by these prehistoric groups for cooking and pottery.<ref name="maki05" />  The LIRM anomaly was significantly bigger than the other magnetic anomalies and formed a dendritic structure.<ref name="maki05" />  To test the validity of the assertion that the magnetic anomaly was indeed the result of lightning and not another process, Maki (2005) tested the soil samples against known standards indicative of LIRM anomalies developed by Dunlop et al. (1984), Wasilewski and Kletetschka (1999), and Verrier and Rochette (2002).<ref name="verrier" /><ref name=dunlop>{{cite journal|last=Dunlop|first=D. J.|coauthors=L. D. Schutt and C. J.

LIRM anomalies also complicated the determination of the relative location of the poles during the late [[Cretaceous]] from the magnetic field record of basaltic lava flows in [[Mongolia]].<ref name=hankard>{{cite journal|last=Hankard|first=F.|coauthors=J.
