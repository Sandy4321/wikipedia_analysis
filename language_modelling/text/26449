'''Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A.''', commonly referred to as '''Lamborghini''', is an Italian manufacturer of high performance [[sports car]]s based in the small [[Italy|Italian]] [[village]] of [[Sant'Agata Bolognese]], near [[Bologna]].  Lamborghini is now a subsidiary of [[Germany|German]] car manufacturer [[Audi|Audi AG]], which is in turn a subsidiary of [[Volkswagen Group]].<ref>[http://www.audi.com/audi/com/en2/about_audi_ag/participations/lamborghini_holding.html Audi.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.vwgroupsupply.com/b2b/vwb2b_folder/supplypublic/en/brands/lamborghini.frameset_inner.html VW Group Supply.com]</ref>  Lamborghini's latest model, the [[Lamborghini Revent<U+00F3>n|Revent<U+00F3>n]], is one of the fastest and most expensive of the Italian supercars.  The company was founded in 1963 by businessman [[Ferruccio Lamborghini]] ([[April 28]], [[1916]]&ndash;[[February 20]], [[1993]]), who owned a successful [[tractor]] [[factory]], ''Lamborghini Trattori S.p.A.''.

==History==
===Origin===
As told by Ferruccio Lamborghini's son, Ferruccio Lamborghini went to meet [[Enzo Ferrari]] at the [[Ferrari]] factory to complain about the quality of the [[clutch]] in his [[Ferrari 250]] GT<ref>[http://net.comune.cento.fe.it/renazzo/english/elamborghini.htm FAMOUS PEOPLE FROM RENAZZO: Ferruccio Lamborghini]</ref>.  An infuriated Enzo Ferrari sent him away telling him to go drive his tractors because he was not able to drive cars. Lamborghini went back to his factory to have the Ferrari's clutch dismantled and found that the clutch in the Ferrari was a product of the manufacturer who supplied the clutches used in Lamborghini tractors. Lamborghini installed a stronger clutch from his factory's warehouse into his Ferrari and solved the clutch failure.  

Furious with Enzo Ferrari's arrogant and aloof manner, Ferruccio Lamborghini promised himself he would never own another Ferrari and would beat Ferrari at his own game by creating a superior sports car of his own{{Fact|date=January 2008}}. 

Ferruccio decided that his car was to have a [[V12]] engine.  The talented engineer, [[Giotto Bizzarrini]], was assigned to produce the blueprint.  Bizzarrini had worked for Ferrari as an engineer and had experience with the development of the Ferrari V12. The new engine had 4 [[camshaft]]s, a short stroke, and 2 big bore valves per cylinder.  The engine developed 350 [[horsepower]] (260&nbsp;kW). The engine featured aluminum construction, a seven main bearing [[crankshaft]], forged aluminum pistons, and [[camshafts]] with their own half-engine-speed sprocket with silent chain. The body was designed by [[Franco Scaglione]].

Born under the sign of the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], Ferruccio Lamborghini used the bull as the badge to mark his new automobile.

The [[Lamborghini 350GTV]] prototype was introduced at the 1963 Turin Auto Show.  Lamborghini commissioned [[Carrozzeria Touring]] to design a more practical model.  This was put into production as the [[Lamborghini 350GT|350GT]].  Sales of the 350GT totaled 130.

===Under Ferruccio Lamborghini===
[[Image:400GT.JPG|thumb|Lamborghini 400GT]]
The 350GT was followed by the [[Lamborghini 400GT|400GT]].  Profits from the 400GT and its predecessor gave the company ample capital to design its first supercar, the [[Lamborghini Miura]].  The chassis of the new Miura was introduced by Ferruccio himself at the November 1965 Turin Auto Show.  The car's engine was [[transverse engine|transversely]] mounted. The styling was executed by [[Marcello Gandini]] in less than a year.  The completed car was displayed at the March 1966 [[Geneva Auto Show]].  The car's name was taken from the famed fighting-bull trainer, Don Eduardo Miura. The Miura was a success.  One hundred and eleven Miuras were sold in 1967.  Seven hundred and sixty-one were made in total. The Miura propelled the company into the small world of exotic supercar manufacturers. 

The [[Lamborghini_Espada|Espada]], a four-seat car based on the Marzal concept car, was developed along side of the Miura. The name Espada means sword in Spanish, and referred to the sword used by the matador in bullfighting. Using the 4-litre V12 in a conventional front engine layout, the low slung touring car could attain a top speed of approximately {{convert|150|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  An interesting feature of the Espada was a glass taillight panel that used the same taillights as the contemporary Fiat 124 Coupe. The Espada received minor improvements over its production, resulting in three distinct series.

In 1971, Lamborghini produced the [[Lamborghini Countach#Prototype LP500|LP500 Countach]] prototype.  The Countach was named after an Italian slang term uttered in surprise by [[Nuccio Bertone]] upon seen the car for the first time. The production [[Lamborghini Countach#Production LP400|LP400 Countach]] was introduced three years later. The prototype was the first car to sport Lamborghini's now-traditional scissor doors, along with vertically mounted rear air intakes. The Countach's V12 engine initially had the same 4-litre capacity as the Miura, but this was enlarged to  five litres upon the introduction of the LP500S Countach in 1982. The Countach was one of the first cars to use the Pirelli P-Zero tires.  Lamborghini's own test driver would often demonstrate the Countach's abilities to journalists.  Stories of the Countach's amazing high speed cornering, power and grip were common. Another detail noted by journalists was the manner in which reversing a Countach was accomplished; raising the driver's door and sitting on the door sill.
[[Image:Lamboghini traktor.jpg|thumb|Caption|Lamborghini tractor]]
In 1972, however, the company suffered a major setback. A massive tractor order from a South American nation was canceled.  In preparation of the order, Lamborghini had made upgrades to its factories to accommodate the increase in demand.  Financial complications forced Ferruccio to sell part of his share of the tractor factory to [[Fiat]]. The tractor business was eventually acquired by SAME (now [[Same Deutz-Fahr]]). Lamborghini tractors are still sold today, as part of the SAME Deutz-Fahr Group.

Throughout the seventies, sales of the Countach kept the company in business. Eventually, the automobile division became self-sufficient and profitable. Lamborghini, however, sold all his remaining stock in the company to a Swiss investor.  Lamborghini left the automotive industry to pursue wine making from his villa in the countryside. Ferruccio Lamborghini died in February 1993 at the age of 76.

===Bankruptcy, Mimran, and Chrysler===
{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
The 1970s oil crisis plagued sales of high performance cars, and Lamborghini suffered budget and parts supply problems; cars were sold with two-year back orders, and customers became fed up with waiting for their cars.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Also, Lamborghinis were never raced and were never fully developed; the company developed a reputation of building high-performance production cars while [[Ferrari]] and [[Porsche]], and [[Maserati]] before them built illustrious careers in the racing world.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Since the beginning the cars had continuous and expensive reliability problems, in the '70s things became even worse, as cars now had to meet US emission requirements.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} All these factors contributed to the company's demise. Like many other exotic Italian automobiles, the components used were often of poor quality.{{Fact|date=August 2007}} In 1978, Lamborghini declared bankruptcy. An Italian court was appointed to find a buyer, and the Swiss-based Mimran brothers took over the company. The 1980s saw things turn around for Lamborghini under its new ownership.

In a surprise move, the company was sold to the [[Chrysler]] Corporation in 1987. Lamborghini at the time was working on the Countach's successor, the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo]]. Chrysler brought its vast resources to the playing field, along with design input, pollution controls, and new manufacturing techniques. The end result was another success for the company{{Fact|date=January 2008}}. The [[Lamborghini Diablo]] received fame much like that of its predecessor, and once again put the manufacturer on top of its game.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

===Post-Chrysler: Megatech and Audi===
[[Image:Lamborghini Polizia.JPG|thumb|right|One of the [[Lamborghini Gallardo|Lamborghini Gallardo]] of the ''Polizia Stradale'']]
In 1994, poor economic circumstances at Chrysler forced them to sell Lamborghini to an Indonesian investment group headed by [[Tommy Suharto]]. These owners sold the company in the late 1990s, also while suffering from poor economic circumstances. By then however, the German car company [[Audi]] AG had gained interest in the ailing Italian company, and in 1998, in a complex series of transactions, Audi AG became the sole owner of Automobili Lamborghini.

Lamborghini's latest owner once again greatly influenced the design of its cars, such as today's [[Lamborghini Murcielago|Murcielago]]. Audi's vast technical resources helped produce one of Lamborghini's most sophisticated cars to date.

Lamborghini's outrageous supercar models have brought Lamborghini much fame. The Miura, the Countach, the Diablo, and the Murci<U+00E9>lago, continue to be some of the most desired super cars of all time. The current (2007) range consists of the [[Lamborghini Murci<U+00E9>lago#LP640|Murci<U+00E9>lago LP640]], the [[Lamborghini Murci<U+00E9>lago#LP640 Roadster|Murci<U+00E9>lago LP640 Roadster]] and the smaller, less expensive Gallardo, Gallardo Spyder and Gallardo Superleggera. All are extremely fast, mid-engined 2-seaters with Lamborghini's standard all-wheel drive systems. Their styling is largely the work of Belgian designer [[Luc Donckerwolke]]. Future models may include a rear-wheel-drive version of the Gallardo and possibly an SUV in the spirit of the [[Lamborghini LM002|LM002]]. The next generation of Lamborghini models will be penned by [[Walter de'Silva]], who designed the 2006 [[Lamborghini Miura#2006 Miura concept|Miura concept]] car and who replaced Luc Donckerwolke as head of Centro Stile Lamborghini, Lamborghini's in-house design department.

Ferruccio Lamborghini had set a rule that Lamborghini would not be involved in motor racing.  He saw such a program as too expensive and too demanding in company resources.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Consequently, no Lamborghini racing car was fabricated under his management. The closest the company came to building racing cars at that time was when the company's test driver Bob Wallace made a few highly modified prototypes based on existing models. Notable among these are the Miura SV based ''Jota'' and the Jarama S based ''Bob Wallace Special''.

Under the management of Rosetti, Lamborghini entered into an agreement with [[BMW]] to build a production racing car in sufficient quantity for homologation.  However, Lamborghini found itself unable to fulfill their part of the agreement.  The car was eventually developed in-house by the BMW Motorsport Division, and was manufactured and sold as the [[BMW M1]].<ref>[http://www.is-it-a-lemon.com/used-car-history/bmw-m1.htm Auto Lemon - Used Car History Check: BMW M1]</ref><ref>[http://www.qv500.com/bmwm1p1.php BMW M1 Car Guide]</ref>

Lamborghini developed the QVX for the 1986 [[Group C]] championship season.  One car was built, but lack of sponsorship caused it to miss the season.  The QVX competed in only one race, the non-championship 1986 Southern Suns 500 km race at [[Kyalami]] in [[South Africa]], driven by [[Tiff Needell]].  Despite the car finishing better than it started, sponsorship could not be found and the program was cancelled.<ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghiniqvxp1.php Lamborghini QVX Car Guide]</ref>

Lamborghini was an engine supplier in [[Formula One]] between the [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] and [[1993 Formula One season]]s. It supplied engines to [[Larousse]], [[Ligier]], [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Minardi]] and to a '[[Modena (racing team)|Lamborghini]]' team, although this last was not viewed as a works team by the car company. The 1992 Larousse/Lamborghini was largely uncompetitive but noteworthy in its tendency to spew oil from its exhaust system. Cars following closely behind the Larousse were commonly colored yellowish-brown by the end of the race. 

Late in 1991, a Lamborghini Formula One motor would be used in the [[Konrad KM-011]] [[Group C]] sports car, but the car would only last a few races before the project was canceled.  The same engine, badged as a [[Chrysler]] by Lamborghini's then parent company, was tested by [[McLaren]] towards the end of the 1993 season, with a view to its use during the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]]. Although driver Ayrton Senna was reportedly impressed with the engine's performance, McLaren pulled out of negotiations, choosing a [[Peugeot]] engine instead, and Chrysler ended the project.

Two racing versions of the Diablo were built for the Diablo Supertrophy, a single-model racing series held annually from 1996 to 1999.  In the first year, the model used in the series was the Diablo SVR, while the Diablo 6.0 GTR was used for the remaining three years.<ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghinidiablop11.php Lamborghini Diablo SVR] </ref> <ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghinidiablop13.php Lamborghini Diablo 6.0 GTR Car Guide]</ref>

Lamborghini developed the Murci<U+00E9>lago R-GT as a production racing car to compete in the [[FIA GT Championship]], the [[Super GT]] Championship and the [[American Le Mans Series]] in 2004.  Their highest placing in any race that year was the opening round of the FIA GT Championship at [[Circuit de Valencia|Valencia]], where the car entered by [[Reiter Engineering]] finished third from a fifth-place start.<ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghinimurcielagop3.php Lamborghini Murci<U+00E9>lago R-GT Car Guide]</ref> <ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghinimurcielagop4.php Lamborghini Murci<U+00E9>lago R-GT 2004 Season]</ref> In 2006 during the opening round of the Super GT championship at [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]], a car run by the [[Japan Lamborghini Owners Club]] garnered the first victory (in class) by an R-GT.

A [[FIA GT3 European Championship|GT3]] version of the Gallardo has been developed by [[Reiter Engineering]].<ref>[http://www.qv500.com/lamborghinigallardop5.php Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 Car Guide]</ref> 

A Murci<U+00E9>lago R-GT entered by All-Inkl.com racing, driven by [[Christophe Bouchut]] and [[Stefan Mucke]], won the opening round of the [[FIA GT Championship]] held at [[Zhuhai International Circuit]], achieving the first major international race victory for Lamborghini.<ref>[http://www.fiagt.com/results.php FIA GT Championship Results: 2007 Round 1 - Zhuhai]</ref>
