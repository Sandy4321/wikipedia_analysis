===Graysville Academy, 1892-1897===
[[File:Graysville Academy, 1895.jpg|thumb|Graysville Academy, 1895]]
The Graysville Seventh-day Adventist Church was organized on September 8, 1888, and by the fall of 1890, the members had dedicated a church building. R.M. Kilgore, former president of the [[Illinois]] Conference had been asked to supervise the church's work in the Southern United States. He had just moved to Graysville and was present for the church dedication.<ref>{{cite book | last = Reiber | first = Milton T. | title = Graysville: 1888-1988, Battle Creek of the South | url           = http://www.archive.org/details/GraysvilleBattleCreekOfTheSouth | accessdate    =    | year      =  1989 | publisher =  The College Press | location  = Collegedale, Tennessee | page = 3}}</ref> As the superintendent for the church's work in the South, Kilgore repeatedly advocated the establishment of a school.

Kilgore invited George W. Colcord (1843<U+2013>1902),<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Wilcox  | first = Francis M.  | title = Obituaries: Colcord  | journal = Review and Herald  | volume = 79  | issue = 47  | page = 23   | publisher = Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association  | location = Battle Creek, Michigan  | date = November 25, 1902  | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH19021125-V79-47__B.pdf#view=fit }}</ref> to come to Graysville and establish a school. Colcord was the founder of Milton Academy, which is the forerunner of [[Walla Walla University]].<ref>{{Cite book  | last = Spalding   | first = Arthur Whitefield  | title = Captains of the Host   | publisher = Review and Herald Publishing Association  | year = 1949  | location = Washington, D.C.   | page = 505 | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/CH/CH1949__B.pdf#view=fit }}</ref> The General Conference Education Secretary, W. W. Prescott, along with Kilgore and Colcord worked together to establish the school at Graysville. Colcord and his wife Ada began the school. The first term began in February, 1892, with 23 students. The second term began in September of that year. By January 1893 Colcord reported that 62 students were in attendance. By 1893 there were three full-time teachers and three part-time teachers. Prescott considered the positive attitude of the school's faculty, students and supporters to be indicators of the school's future success and good reason to start other such schools in the South.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Prescott  | first = W. W.  | title = Report of the Educational Secretary: New Institutions  | journal = Daily Bulletin of the General Conference  | volume = 5  | issue = 15  | page = 354 (electronic 6)  | date = February 23, 1893  | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/doc_info.asp?DocID=3097}}</ref>

During 1892, Colcord operated the school privately. Then, at the session of the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference held at [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], February 17 to March 6, 1893, the church officially took over the school. This first school in the South inspired the session to recommend that other schools also be established.<ref>{{Citation

In the Fall of 1894, Graysville Academy faced a crisis. Fourteen of the members of the Graysville Church were indicted for having violated the Tennessee [[Sunday law]]. This included Colcord, his nephew, Prof. I. C. Colcord, and M. C. Sturdevant, manager of the boys' dormitory.<ref>{{Cite journal  | editor= Alonzo T. Jones

The church members found guilty refused to pay the fines, choosing to go to prison instead. The imprisonment of the school's leaders resulted in its immediate closing for the rest of the year.

===Southern Industrial School, 1897-1901===

In November 1897, the district conference voted to change the school's name to Southern Industrial School. The name change reflected a change in the school's emphasis. Industries were established including a wagon and blacksmith shop, a broom shop, a printshop and a school farm. The farm grew peaches, pears and many types of berries and vegetables.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Reiber  | first = Milton T.  | title = The Battle Creek of the South  | journal = Adventist Review  | volume = 172   | issue = 15  | pages = 17<U+2013>18  | publisher = Review and Herald Publishing Association  | location = Hagerstown, Maryland  | date = April 13, 1995  | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH19950413-V172-15__C.pdf#view=fit  | issn = }}</ref>

The Southern Union Conference was organized in April 1901. Kilgore, the superintendent of the Southern District, known as District 2, was elected the first president of the Southern Union Conference. The headquarters was in Graysville. The General Conference arranged for the Southern Union to take over the operation of the Southern Industrial School. The property was transferred to the Southern Union. They renamed the school the Southern Training School. It offered 14 grades of instruction.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last = Reiber  | first = Milton T.  | title = The Battle Creek of the South | date = April 13, 1995 }} <!-- | journal = Adventist Review  | volume = 172   | issue = 15  | page = 18  | publisher = Review and Herald Publishing Association  | location = Hagerstown, Maryland    | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/RH/RH19950413-V172-15__C.pdf#view=fit  | issn = }} -->p.18</ref>

====Pioneer years====

In 1916, the school's property holdings totaled $32,000. Two years later, due mainly to the construction of additional buildings on campus, the school's holdings increased to $113,000. Many students earned their tuition by helping to construct these buildings. Southern was financially supported by two union conferences of the Church's North American administration. The school organized construction bees. Interested church members came from across the South to help in these bees.<ref name = "Wood" /><ref>{{Cite journal

At first, the school taught only students in grades 1-12 with a total enrollment of 59 students. In 1918, three students were taking post-high school level classes.

Southern Junior College served two union conferences of Seventh-day Adventists, the Southern and the Southeastern. Later these two would be reorganized into one, the Southern Union Conference. In 1920, Lynn H. Wood, the president of the college, presented a major report to meetings for both union conferences. He reviewed the events of the first four years at the Ooltewah location.<ref name = "Wood" />

According to Wood, enrollment grew quickly because of a tuition work program. Students of limited means realized they could get an education and improve themselves.<ref name = "Wood" /> This put a strain on housing. But the desire for an education motivated the students to cope with those early inadequate facilities, "Students have been willing to live in shacks and tents, to put up with all kinds of inconvenience, in order that they might receive the character development that the school had for them." Wood referred to these first few years as the "pioneer years." He wrote that the positive spiritual attitude of the students made these years the most enjoyable that one could wish for.<ref name = "Wood" />

The college built the girls' dormitory first. The girls moved in before it was finished, even before there was any heating, doors or chairs. They used "curtains for doors, sat upon their trunks for chairs <U+2014> any way to get along."<ref name = "Wood" />

====Faith community support====

The building of the boys' dormitory began in the summer of 1918. The students helped build it, and, in doing so, many earned their way through school. Shortly after the beginning of the school year in 1918, a "Workers' Bee" took place. Church workers from all across the South and from church headquarters in Washington, D.C. came to the college to build the boys' dormitory. For two and a half weeks they worked and associated with the students. They succeeded in putting up most of the framework.<ref name = "Wood" />

Other help from the Adventist faith community included a $6,000 donation by the Southern Publishing Association for a water supply system and another "Working Bee" to build a large dairy barn, a blacksmith shop, and a corn crib. People interested in the college's success bought surrounding properties and donated them to the institution, more than doubling the school's area to close to {{convert|600|acre|km2}}. This allowed the school to protect itself from families moving so close that they hindered their young people attending from learning some independence, President Wood wrote. He encouraged families to send their young people to the school, and if the cost was too high for some of them, he advised that church leaders make sure they got the help they needed for their young people to attend and live in the dormitory.<ref name = "Wood"/>

===Southern Missionary College, 1944-1982===
[[File:Wright-Hall-SouthernMissionaryCollege-1967.png|thumb|250px|Wright Hall, the administrative building of Southern Missionary College, was completed in 1967]]

In 1944, the Seventh Day Adventist General Conference Spring Council voted for Southern to become a [[College#United_States|four year college]]. The enrollment that first year was the highest ever to date, 436 students. The theology, teaching and pre-nursing departments had the highest enrollments. Industries that helped students earn their tuition included a wood shop, a broom factory, a printing press, and a farm. The name Southern Missionary College was chosen at a combined meeting of the members of the college board, the union educational board, and the college faculty.<ref>{{Cite journal

On July 1, 1982, the word "Missionary" was dropped from the school's name. The reported reasons for the change were that the general population reacted negatively to the term; foreign countries resisted accepting church workers who were from a "missionary" college; the name incorrectly identified the school as only a Bible college, rather than a fully accredited, four-year liberal arts institution; and, graduates found the name "missionary" made it more difficult for them to get a job. Southern was the last Adventist college in North America to retain "missionary" in its title. The others changed their names many years earlier.<ref>"SMC to change name" (1982), p. 23</ref>

In their official announcement of the name change, the Board of Trustees of Southern Missionary College explained that a shorter name would help popularize it. They also stated that, "The word 'Southern' has been associated with the College since its beginning<U+2014>Southern Industrial School, Southern Training School, Southern Junior College, Southern Missionary College, and now Southern College."<ref>{{Cite journal  | title = The Board of Trustees...  | journal = Southern Tidings  | volume = 76  | issue = 5  | page = 5  | publisher = The Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists  | location = Decatur, Georgia  | date = May, 1982  | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/SUW/SUW19820501-V76-05__B.pdf#view=fit  | accessdate = 2011-05-20}}</ref>

===Early 1980s controversy===

As the decade began, Southern College found itself drawn into wider church controversies involving [[Desmond Ford]], Walter Rae, and [[Ronald Numbers]]'s book, ''The Prophetess of Health''. The controversy was set off after a visit to the campus by a leading Bible scholar and theologian of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, [[Edward Heppenstall]], who was seen as responsible for a more progressive understanding of the church's "[[investigative judgment]]" teaching, and who was also mentor to Desmond Ford.<ref>Knight, George R. ''A Search for Identity: the Development of Seventh-day Adventist Beliefs'', Review and Herald Pub. Assoc. (2000), pp.171-175.</ref> It came out in the open after a showing of a [[James Dobson]] film on campus when a teacher from the theology department made a comment that seemed to disagree with statements made by church pioneer [[Ellen G. White]].<ref name="SpectrumReport">{{cite journal|last1=Jennings|first1=Marie|last2=Cook|first2=Joan Marie|title=Adventist Colleges Under Siege 2.

In the following months, various concerns converged.<ref name="SpectrumReport"/> In the ensuing controversies, Southern experienced a change of faculty, including the removal of President Frank Knittel and the resignation in protest of Tom Zwemer from the [[Board of Trustees]].<ref name="SpectrumReport"/> [[Jerry Gladson]], a professor of [[Old Testament]] Studies at Southern, also left the school. His credentials as a minister of the church were not renewed.<ref name="jiforum"/><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20101209084317/http://atoday.com/files/Vol%203%20No%206_0.pdf "War of Cultures at Southern College"]  ''Adventist Today'', November<U+2013>December 1995, pp. 6-13.

===Southern Adventist University, 1996-present===

In May 1996, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted approval for Southern to become an accredited Level III institution, allowing the school to confer master's degrees.

It is usual to be productive in one's prime years, but consider Ray's accomplishments both early and late in his long career. In his 30s, teaching Bible at PUC, he became one of the first Adventist theologians to join a scholarly religious society; and simultaneously, he cofounded the first Adventist Biblical research fellowship, an association that evolved into the current [[Biblical Research Institute]] at the General Conference. After formal retirement, in his 70s, Ray advocated the need for a judicial branch of church governance. In his 80s he argued for relative autonomy for the General Conference Divisions in our increasingly diverse world church. And then, just last year (2002), he courageously called for progress beyond our dated sanctuary doctrine. ''Was Ray right in all these '''progressive''' positions?''

The point is that Ray epitomized the spirit of Adventism and its fearless pioneers in conscientiously advocating what he saw as vital and true." p. 10.
