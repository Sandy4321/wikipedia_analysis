"'''Going Crazy'''" ([[Korean language|Korean]]: <U+BBF8><U+CE5C><U+AC70><U+B2C8>) is a song recorded by [[South Korean idol]] [[singer]] [[Song Jieun]]. It is released as a [[Digital single]] on January 6, 2011 through [[TS Entertainment]]. The song's inspiration came from the producers who have felt they needed to showcase a more darker side of Jieun thus coming up with the idea of a stalking relationship. The song features [[B.A.P]]'s Bang Yong Guk and sings the rap parts of the song. The song's lyrics tells of a relationship in which the protagonist couldn't stand the stalking of her obsessed ex-lover.

The song was composed and produced by Kang Jiwon and Kim Kibum, the same composers of Secret's hits such as [[Magic (Secret song)|Magic]], [[Madonna (song)|Madonna]] and [[Shy Boy (Secret song)|Shy Boy]]. "Going Crazy" is a midtempo hip hop ballad with guitar, piano and violin instrumentation. Featured singer, Bang Yong Guk participated in the song's production by writing the lyrics of his rap parts in "Going Crazy".

The single was promoted with live performances and a music video. Jieun and Yong Guk promoted the song on [[M! Countdown]], [[Music Bank]], [[SBS MTV|MTV's The Show]], [[Music Core]] and [[Inkigayo]]. In December 2011, a remix version of "Going Crazy" was performed on MBC's 2011 Gayo Daejaejun!. They also performed the song on B.A.P's debut showcase in January 2011. The accompanying video, directed by Johnny Bro's Hon Won Ki and filmed in February 2011, stars [[Min Hyorin]] and B.A.P's Kim Himchan in a kidnapping scene as Jieun and Yong Guk perform in an abandoned building and a deserted farm land. 

"Going Crazy" was well received by music critics and among netizens, and charted strongly throughout various music charts. Fans praised the song for its matured lyrics as well as Jieun's vocal performance and Yong Guk's rapping skills.  The song managed to peak at number one on the [[Gaon Single Chart]] despite strong competition from [[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]] and [[IU (singer)|IU]].

In July 2011, The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family of South Korea compiled a list of songs going to be banned for their harmful content to the youth. Among those was "Going Crazy" because both the song and its music video were encouraging crime. With this, songs that are banned cannot be sold to minors under the age of 19 and cannot be aired before 10 PM KST through radio or television.<ref name=nate2>{{ko icon}}{{cite web|title=<U+BE44><U+C2A4><U+D2B8>-<U+D3EC><U+BBF8><U+B2DB>-<U+BC15><U+C7AC><U+BC94>, <U+CCAD><U+C18C><U+B144> <U+C720><U+D574><U+B9E4><U+CCB4><U+BB3C> <U+D310><U+C815> <U+C65C>?|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20110718n09387|publisher=Nate (SK Communications)|accessdate=2012-2-8}}</ref>

==Music video==
===Sypnosis===
[[File:Going Crazy screen shots.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Video stills in which Min Hyorin kisses Kim Him Chan (Right) before exploding the car with fire while Himchan is in the car trunk(Left)]]
The music video opens with a woman (Min Hyorin) parking a car in a highway at night. After the woman opens her car trunk, the video flashes back in the morning where the woman was driving in a highway. Jieun proceeds to sing the first verse of the song while playing a piano in an abandoned building. Then Yong Guk begins to rap in a red wall and in a misty rice field while Jieun keeps playing the piano in the abandoned building. After the inter-changing shots between the three, Jieun proceeds to sing the chorus in the rice field and there were also shots were she sings at the back seat of the car. After the first chorus, the woman stopped the car to check her lighter then returns to drive to her destination. 

Jieun returns to sing the second verse of the song with interchanging scenes from the abandoned building, the misty rice field and at the back seat of the car. Yong Guk proceeds to rap in the misty rice field but this time his hands are tied up with ropes while sitting in a chair and blindfolded in the scene where he raps in a red wall. The video returns back at the present where the woman parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts to sing the second chorus, the woman opened her car trunk in a front view, therefore revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up in ropes. The woman takes a jug of gasoline in the trunk of her car and kissed the man. She later spilled amounts of gasoline on the man and then walked at a distance from the car. The video ends with the woman lighting up her lighter and throwing it in the car but cutting out the explosion part.

===Music Bank special===
On March 3, 2011 Jieun debuted on music programs with her first solo single, <U+201D>Going Crazy<U+201C>. She continued her round of promotions, but on March 11, 2011 she prepared a "special treat" for fans watching KBS<U+2018>s <U+201C>Music Bank<U+201C>. Jieun and Yong Guk were set to perform the song in the usual setting, but instead of a live stage, a special alternative music video for <U+201C>Going Crazy<U+201D> was aired. Song Ji Eun acted out a scenario where she was being stalked by an obsessive man played by Yong Guk who also plays as a police investigator <U+2013> leaving the idea that perhaps Jieun's character tried to free herself from the "manic clutches' of her stalker in a "less-than-legal manner".<ref name=akpalternativeMV>{{cite web|title=Song Ji Eun films a special <U+201C>Going Crazy<U+201D> MV for <U+2018>Music Bank<U+2019>|url=http://www.allkpop.com/2011/03/song-ji-eun-films-a-special-going-crazy-mv-for-music-bank|publisher=6theory Media|accessdate=2012-2-8}}</ref>
