"'''Inolvidable'''" ("Unforgettable") is a song written by Julio Guti<U+00E9>rrez in 1944. It is considered one of the most popular [[bolero]]s released during the Cuban musical movement led by pianists. The song has been recorded by several performers, including [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Diego El Cigala]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Eydie Gorm<U+00E9>]], [[Danny Rivera]], [[Tito Rodr<U+00ED>guez]] and [[Bebo Vald<U+00E9>s]], among others.

In the song, the protagonist kisses different lips looking for new sensations, haunted by the memory of a past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer [[Luis Miguel]] on his album ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'' released in 1991. This version peaked at the top of the [[Top Latin Songs|''Billboard'' Top Latin Songs]] chart in the United States, and the album was deemed as responsible for reviving the bolero genre.

==Background and composition==
"Inolvidable" was written by Cuban pianist Julio Guti<U+00E9>rrez. Guti<U+00E9>rrez was born in [[Manzanillo, Cuba]], and at age six he played piano and at 14 he directed his own orchestra.<ref name="bigott2">{{harvnb|Bigott|1993|p=180}}</ref> In 1940, the [[Orquesta Casino de la Playa|Orchestra Casino de la Playa]] toured eastern Cuba, and on that tour [[Miguelito Vald<U+00E9>s]] met Guti<U+00E9>rrez and suggested he should go to the capital ([[Havana]]), where better opportunities would arise. Months later, Guti<U+00E9>rrez moved to the capital, and was hired as a pianist in the orchestra Casino de la Playa.<ref name="bigott2"/> "Inolvidable", written in 1944,<ref name="liner-lm">[[Luis Miguel]] ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'' (Liner Notes) [[Warner Music Group|Warner]] (1991)</ref> was released during the Cuban musical movement led by [[pianists]], in which Guti<U+00E9>rrez participated.<ref name="bigott">{{harvnb|Bigott|1993|p=57}}</ref> Two songs composed by Guti<U+00E9>rrez, "Inolvidable" and "Llanto de Luna" ("Crying Moon"), were highly successful boleros in [[Latin America]].<ref name="led"/> In 1992, a compilation album including an instrumental version of the song performed by Guti<U+00E9>rrez was released.<ref name="inolvi-lm">{{cite web |title=Instrumental <U+2013> Julio Guti<U+00E9>rrez |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r289851|pure_url=yes}}|work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=May 3, 2012}}</ref>
