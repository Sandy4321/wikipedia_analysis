The '''walrus''' (''Odobenus rosmarus''), also known as the [[saber-toothed seal]], is a large [[pinniped|flippered]] [[marine mammal]] with a discontinuous distribution about the [[North Pole]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[subarctic]] seas of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The walrus is the only living species in the Odobenidae [[family (biology)|family]] and ''Odobenus'' [[genus]]. This species is subdivided into three [[subspecies]]:<ref name=msw3/> the Atlantic walrus (''O. r. rosmarus'') which lives in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Pacific walrus (''O. r. divergens'') which lives in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and ''O. r. laptevi'', which lives in the [[Laptev Sea]] of the Arctic Ocean.

Adult walruses are easily recognized by their prominent [[tusk]]s, [[vibrissa|whiskers]],  and bulkiness. Adult males in the Pacific  can weigh more than {{convert|1700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref name="Walrus: Physical Characteristics">[http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/walrus/phycharwal.html Walrus: Physical Characteristics]. seaworld.org</ref> and, among [[pinniped]]s, are exceeded in size only by the two species of [[elephant seal]]s.<ref name="Fay85">{{cite journal|author = Fay, F.H.|year = 1985|url = http://www.science.smith.edu/departments/Biology/VHAYSSEN/msi/default.html|title = Odobenus rosmarus|journal = [[Mammalian Species]]|volume = 238|pages = 1<U+2013>7|doi = 10.2307/3503810|issue = 238|jstor = 3503810}}</ref> Walruses live mostly in shallow waters above the [[continental shelves]], spending significant amounts of their lives on the [[sea ice]] looking for [[benthic zone|benthic]] [[bivalvia|bivalve mollusk]]s to eat. Walruses are relatively long-lived, social animals, and they are considered to be a "[[keystone species]]" in the Arctic marine regions.

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many [[circumpolar peoples|indigenous Arctic peoples]], who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their [[blubber]], [[walrus ivory]], and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev walruses remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.

==Etymology==
[[File:Walrus on Carta Marina.jpeg|left|thumb|A walrus, labeled ''Ros marus piscis'', is depicted in <U+0430> 16th-century map of Scandinavia (the [[Carta Marina]]).]]
The origin of the word ''walrus'' is thought to derive from a [[Germanic language]], and it has been attributed largely to either the [[Dutch language]] or [[Old Norse]]. Its first part is thought to derive from a word such as Dutch ''walvis'' 'whale'. Its second part has also been hypothesized to come from the Old Norse word for 'horse'.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/walrus Dictionary.com]. Dictionary.reference.com. Retrieved 16 September 2011.</ref> For example, the [[Old Norse]] word ''hrossvalr'' means 'horse-whale' and is thought to have been passed in an inverted form to both Dutch and the dialects of northern Germany as ''walros'' and ''Walross''.<ref>Dansk Etymologisk Ordbog, Niels Age Nielsen, Gyldendal 1966</ref> An alternate theory is that is comes from the Dutch words ''wal'' 'shore' and ''reus'' 'giant'.<ref>[http://iberianature.com/britainnature/miscellaneous/etymology-of-mammal-names-in-english/ Etymology of mammal names]. Iberianature.com (29 December 2010). Retrieved 16 September 2011.</ref>

The Norwegian manuscript ''Konungsskuggsja'', thought to date from around 1240 AD refers to the walrus as "rosmhvalr" in Iceland and "rostungr" in Greenland (walruses were by now extinct in Iceland and Norway, while the word evolved on in Greenland). Several place names in Iceland, Greenland and Norway may originate from walrus sites; Hvalfjord, Hvallatrar and Hvalsnes to name some, all being typical walrus breeding grounds.

The archaic English word for walrus<U+2014>''morse''<U+2014>is widely thought to have come from the [[Slavic languages]].<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/ morse, n., etymology of] The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press.</ref> Compare <U+043C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0436> (''mor<U+017E>'') in Russian, ''mursu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''mor<U+0161><U+00E2>'' in [[Saami language|Saami]], and ''morse'' in French. [[Olaus Magnus]], who depicted the walrus in the [[Carta Marina]] in 1539, first referred to the walrus as the ''ros marus'', probably a Latinization of ''mor<U+017E>'', and this was adopted by [[Linnaeus]] in his [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Allen1880>{{cite book|year = 1880|author = Allen, Joel Asaph |title = History of North American pinnipeds, US Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territorie|publisher = Arno Press Inc. (1974 reprint)|url = http://books.google.com/?id=jFspFxseyC8C&printsec=frontcover&q|isbn = 978-0-405-05702-1}}</ref>

The coincidental similarity between ''morse'' and the Latin word ''morsus'' 'a bite' supposedly contributed to the walrus's reputation as a "terrible monster".<ref name=Allen1880/>

The compound ''Odobenus'' comes from ''odous'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] for 'tooth') and ''baino'' (Greek for 'walk'), based on observations of walruses using their tusks to pull themselves out of the water. The term ''divergens'' in [[Latin]] means 'turning apart', referring to their tusks.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The walrus is a mammal in the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Carnivora]]. It is the sole surviving member of the [[family (biology)|family]] Odobenidae, one of three lineages in the [[suborder]] [[Pinnipedia]] along with true seals ([[Phocidae]]) and eared seals ([[Otariidae]]). While there has been some debate as to whether all three lineages are [[monophyletic]], i.e. descended from a single ancestor, or [[diphyletic]], recent genetic evidence suggests all three descended from a [[caniform]] ancestor most closely related to modern bears.<ref name=Lento1995>{{cite journal|author = Lento, G.M., Hickson, R.E., Chambers, G.K., Penny, D.|year = 1995| title = Use of spectral analysis to test hypotheses on the origin of pinnipeds | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 28<U+2013>52 | pmid = 7877495|doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040189 }}</ref> Recent multigene analysis indicates the odobenids and otariids diverged from the phocids about 20<U+2013>26 million years ago, while the odobenids and the otariids separated 15<U+2013>20 million years ago.<ref name=Arnason06>{{cite journal|author = Arnason U|year = 2006|title = Pinniped phylogeny and a new hypothesis for their origin and dispersal|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 41|issue = 2|pages = 345<U+2013>354|doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.05.022|pmid = 16815048|author2 = Gullberg A|author3 = Janke A|last4 = Kullberg|first4 = Morgan|last5 = Lehman|first5 = Niles|last6 = Petrov|first6 = Evgeny A.|last7 = V<U+00E4>in<U+00F6>l<U+00E4>|first7 = Risto}}</ref><ref name=Higdon07>{{cite journal|title=Phylogeny and divergence of the pinnipeds (Carnivora: Mammalia) assessed using a multigene dataset|author=Higdon, Jeff W; Bininda-Emonds, Olaf; Beck, Robin and Ferguson, Steven H|journal=BMC Evol Biol. 2007|volume=7|page=216|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-216|pmc=2245807|pmid=17996107|year=2007}}</ref> Odobenidae was once a highly diverse and widespread family, including at least twenty species in the Imagotariinae, Dusignathinae and Odobeninae subfamilies.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Kohno, N.|year = 2006|title = A new Miocene Odobenid (Mammalia: Carnivora) from Hokkaido, Japan, and its implications for odobenid phylogeny|journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume = 26|issue = 2|page = 411|doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2006)26[411:ANMOMC]2.0.CO;2|issn = 0272-4634}}</ref> The key distinguishing feature was the development of a squirt/suction feeding mechanism; tusks are a later feature specific to Odobeninae, of which the modern walrus is the last remaining ([[relict]]) species.

Two subspecies of walrus are widely recognized: the Atlantic walrus, ''O. r. rosmarus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and the Pacific walrus, ''O. r. divergens'' (Illiger, 1815). Fixed genetic differences between the Atlantic and Pacific subspecies indicate very restricted gene flow, but relatively recent separation, estimated at 500,000 and 785,000 years ago.<ref name=Hoelzel2002>{{cite book|editor = Hoelzel, A.

(Ed.)|year = 2002|title = Marine mammal biology: an evolutionary approach|location = Oxford|publisher = Blackwell Publishing |isbn = 0-632-05232-5}}</ref> These dates coincide with the hypothesis derived from fossils that the walrus evolved from a tropical or subtropical ancestor that became isolated in the Atlantic Ocean and gradually adapted to colder conditions in the Arctic.<ref name=Hoelzel2002/> From there, it presumably recolonized the [[North Pacific Ocean]] during high glaciation periods in the [[Pleistocene]] via the [[Central American Seaway]].<ref name="Arnason06"/>

An isolated population in the [[Laptev Sea]] is considered by some authorities, including many Russian biologists and the canonical ''Mammal Species of the World'',<ref name=msw3/> to be a third subspecies, ''O. r. laptevi'' (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Chapskii, K.K. |year=1940|title = Distribution of the walrus in the Laptev and East Siberian seas|journal = Problemy Severa|volume = 6|pages = 80<U+2013>94}}</ref> Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate<ref name="Fay85"/><ref>{{cite book|author = Born, E.

While some outsized Pacific males can weigh as much as {{convert|2000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, most weigh between {{convert|800|and|1700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. An occasional male of the Pacific race far exceeds normal dimensions.

Since a walrus's hide usually accounts for about 20% of its body weight, the total body mass of these two giants is estimated to have been at least {{convert|2300|kg|lb|-3|abbr=on}}.<ref name = "Wood">{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref> The Atlantic subspecies weighs about 10<U+2013>20% less than the Pacific subspecies.<ref name="Fay85"/> Male Atlantic Walrus weigh an average of {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.seaworld.org/infobooks/Walrus/phycharwal.html Walrus: Physical Characteristics].

The walrus's body shape shares features with both sea lions ([[eared seal]]s: Otariidae) and seals ([[earless seal|true seals]]: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward and move on all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements.<ref name="Fay85"/> Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.

The [[extraocular muscles]] of the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital roof]] allow it to protrude its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species appears to be more suited for short-range.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kastelein |first=Ronlad A. |year=2008 |contribution=Walrus ''Odobenus rosmarus'' |page=1214 |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |editor1-last=Perrin |editor1-first=William F. |editor2-last=W<U+00FC>rsig |editor2-first=Bernd |editor3-last=Thewissen |editor3-first=J.G.M. |edition=2nd |isbn=012373553X }}</ref>

===Tusks and dentition===
The most prominent feature of the walrus is its long tusks. These are elongated [[canine teeth|canines]], which are present in both sexes and can reach a length of 1 m (3 ft 3 in) and weigh up to 5.4&nbsp;kg (12 lb).<ref>{{cite book|author = Berta, A. and Sumich, J. L. |year = 1999|title = Marine mammals: evolutionary biology|publisher = Academic Press|location = San Diego, CA|pages = 494 pp.}}</ref> Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, which use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice.<ref name="Fay82">{{cite journal|author = Fay, F. H.|year = 1982|title = Ecology and Biology of the Pacific Walrus, Odobenus rosmarus divergens Illiger|journal = United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> Tusks were once thought to be used to dig out prey from the seabed, but analyses of abrasion patterns on the tusks indicate they are dragged through the sediment while the upper edge of the snout is used for digging.<ref name="Ray06">{{cite journal|author = Ray, C., McCormick-Ray, J., Berg, P., Epstein, H.E.,|year = 2006|title = Pacific Walrus: Benthic bioturbator of Beringia|journal = Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|pages = 403<U+2013>419|doi = 10.1016/j.jembe.2005.12.043|volume = 330}}</ref> While the [[dentition]] of walruses is highly variable, they generally have relatively few teeth other than the tusks. The maximal number of teeth is 38 with dentition formula: {{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.4.2|lower=3.1.3.2}}, but over half of the teeth are rudimentary and occur with less than 50% frequency, such that a typical dentition includes only 18 teeth  {{DentalFormula|upper=1.1.3.0|lower=0.1.3.0}}<ref name="Fay85"/>

===Vibrissae===
Surrounding the tusks is a broad mat of stiff bristles ('mystacial [[vibrissa]]e'), giving the walrus a characteristic whiskered appearance. There can be 400 to 700 vibrissae in 13 to 15 rows reaching 30 cm (12 in) in length, though in the wild they are often worn to much shorter lengths due to constant use in foraging.<ref name=Kastelein1990>{{cite journal|author = Kastelein, R.A., Stevens, S., & Mosterd, P.|year = 1990|title = The sensitivity of the vibrissae of a Pacific Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens). Part 2: Masking|journal = Aquatic Mammals|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 78<U+2013>87}}</ref> The vibrissae are attached to muscles and are supplied with blood and nerves, making them highly sensitive organs capable of differentiating shapes {{convert|3|mm|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|2|mm|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="Kastelein1990"/>

===Skin===
Aside from the vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly wrinkled and thick, up to {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} around the neck and shoulders of males. The [[blubber|blubber layer]] beneath is up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a [[secondary sexual characteristic]], males also acquire significant nodules, called "bosses", particularly around the neck and shoulders.<ref name="Fay82"/>

The walrus has an [[throat sac|air sac under its throat]] which acts like a floatation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water and sleep. The males possess a large [[baculum]] (penis bone), up to {{convert|63|cm|abbr=on}} in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size.<ref name="Fay85"/>

==Life history==
[[File:Noaa-walrus12.jpg|thumb|left|Walruses fighting|alt=Photo of five walruses on rocky shore]]

===Reproduction===
Walruses live to about 20<U+2013>30 years old in the wild.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Fay, F.H. | year = 1960|title = Carnivorous walrus and some arctic zoonoses|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic13-2-111.pdf|journal = Arctic|volume = 13|issue = 2|pages = 111<U+2013>122}} [http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic14-1-76.pdf Comment]</ref> The males reach sexual maturity as early as seven years, but do not typically mate until fully developed at around 15 years of age.<ref name="Fay85"/> They rut from January through April, decreasing their food intake dramatically. The females begin ovulating as soon as four to six years old.<ref name="Fay85"/> The females are [[polyestrous]], coming into heat in late summer and also around February, yet the males are fertile only around February; the potential fertility of this second period is unknown. Breeding occurs from January to March, peaking in February. Males aggregate in the water around ice-bound groups of estrous females and engage in competitive vocal displays.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Nowicki, S. N.; Stirling, Ian and Sjare, Becky|year = 1997|title = Duration of stereotypes underwater vocal displays by make Atlantic walruses in relation to aerobic dive limit|journal = Marine Mammal Science|volume = 13|issue = 4|pages = 566<U+2013>575|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-7692.1997.tb00084.x}}</ref> The females join them and copulate in the water.<ref name="Fay82"/>

[[Gestation]] lasts 15 to 16 months. The first three to four months are spent with the [[blastula]] in suspended development before it implants itself in the placenta. This strategy of [[delayed implantation]], common among pinnipeds, presumably evolved to optimize both the mating season and the birthing season, determined by ecological conditions that promote newborn survival.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sandell, M.|year = 1990|title = The Evolution of Seasonal Delayed Implantation|journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume = 65|issue = 1|pages = 23<U+2013>42|doi = 10.1086/416583|pmid = 2186428}}</ref> Calves are born during the spring migration, from April to June. They weigh {{convert|45|to|75|kg|abbr=on}} at birth and are able to swim. The mothers nurse for over a year before weaning, but the young can spend up to five years with the mothers.<ref name="Fay82"/> Because ovulation is suppressed until the calf is weaned, females give birth at most every two years, leaving the walrus with the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped.<ref>{{cite book|editor = Evans, P.G.H. & Raga, J.A.|year = 2001|title = Marine mammals: biology and conservation|location = London & New York|publisher = Springer|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=riDDOeRd9JAC&printsec=frontcover|isbn=0-306-46573-6}}</ref>

===Migration===
The rest of the year (late summer and fall), walruses tend to form massive aggregations of tens of thousands of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the [[Bering Sea]] into the [[Chukchi Sea]] through the relatively narrow [[Bering Strait]].<ref name="Fay82"/>

==Ecology==
===Range and habitat===

The majority of the population of the Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the [[Bering Strait]] in the [[Chukchi Sea]] of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern [[Siberia]], around [[Wrangel Island]], in the [[Beaufort Sea]] along the north shore of [[Alaska]], and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the [[Gulf of Anadyr]] on the southern coast of the Siberian [[Chukchi Peninsula]], and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the [[Bering Sea]] along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], and along the southern coast of Alaska.<ref name="Fay85"/> A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of [[San Francisco Bay]], indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Dyke, A.S.|year = 1999|url=http://arctic.synergiesprairies.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/920|title = The Late Wisconsinan and Holocene record of walrus (''Odobenus rosmarus'') from North America: A review with new data from Arctic and Atlantic Canada|journal = Arctic|volume = 52|issue = 2|pages = 160<U+2013>181}}</ref> There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Gilbert, J.R.|year = 1992|title = Aerial census of Pacific walrus, 1990|journal = USFWS R7/MMM Technical Report 92-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = US Fish and Wildlife Service| title = Stock Assessment Report: Pacific Walrus <U+2013> Alaska Stock| year = 2002| url = http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/walrus/pdf/Final_%20Pacific_Walrus_SAR.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

The much smaller population of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across [[Greenland]], [[Svalbard]], and the western part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses, based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Born, E.

The isolated population of Laptev walruses is confined year-round to the central and western regions of the [[Laptev Sea]], the eastmost regions of the [[Kara Sea]], and the westmost regions of the [[East Siberian Sea]]. The current population of these walruses has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.<ref name=MNRRF>{{cite web|title = <U+041C><U+043E><U+0440><U+0436> / Odobenus rosmarus|work=Ministry of Natural Resources of the Russian Federation protected species list|url = http://zapoved.ru/species/262/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6| accessdate = 4 October 2007}}</ref>

The limited diving abilities of walruses brings them to depend on shallow waters (and the  nearby ice floes) for reaching their food supply.

[[File:Walross paar.jpg|thumb|right|Walruses leaving the water|alt=Photo of two walruses in shallow water facing shore]]

Walruses prefer shallow [[Continental shelf|shelf]] regions and forage primarily on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms.<ref name="Fay85"/> They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80 m (260 ft). They can remain submerged for as long as half an hour.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Schreer, J. F.; Kovacs, Kit M. and O'Hara Hines, R. J.|year = 2001|title = Comparative diving patterns of pinnipeds and seabirds|journal = Ecological Monographs|volume = 71|pages = 137<U+2013>162|doi = 10.1890/0012-9615(2001)071[0137:CDPOPA]2.0.CO;2|issn = 0012-9615}}</ref>

The walrus has a diverse and opportunistic diet, feeding on more than 60 genera of marine organisms, including [[shrimp]], crabs, [[Tube worm (body plan)|tube worms]], soft [[coral]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s, various [[mollusk]]s, and even parts of other pinnipeds.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Sheffield G., Fay F.

The walrus palate is uniquely vaulted, enabling effective suction.

Aside from the large numbers of organisms actually consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on benthic communities. It disturbs ([[bioturbation|bioturbates]]) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the [[benthos]].<ref name="Ray06"/>

Seal tissue has been observed in fairly significant proportion of walrus stomachs in the Pacific, but the importance of seals in the walrus diet is under debate.<ref>{{cite book|author = Lowry, L.F. and Frost, K.J.|year = 1981|chapter = Feeding and Trophic Relationships of Phocid Seals and walruses in the Eastern Bering Sea|title = The Eastern Bering Sea Shelf: Oceanography & Resources vol. 2.|editor = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)|publisher = University of Washington Press|pages = 813<U+2013>824}}</ref> There have been isolated observations of walruses preying on seals up to the size of a {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[bearded seal]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-238-01-0001.pdf|author=Fay, F.

===Predation===
Due to its great size and tusks, the walrus has only two natural predators: the [[killer whale]] (orca) and the [[polar bear]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Appliance|first=Mr.|title=Walrus Predators|url=http://www.walrus-world.com/walrus-predators.html}}</ref>  The walrus does not, however, comprise a significant component of either predator's diets. Both the orca and the polar bear are also most likely to prey on walrus calves. The polar bear often hunts the walrus by rushing at beached aggregations and consuming the individuals crushed or wounded in the sudden exodus, typically younger or infirm animals.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Ovsyanikov, N.|year = 1992|title = Ursus ubiquitous|journal = BBC Wildlife|volume = 10|issue = 12|pages = 18<U+2013>26}}</ref> The bears also isolate walruses when they overwinter and are unable to escape a charging bear due to inaccessible diving holes in the ice.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3872939|title=Interactions between Polar Bears and Overwintering Walruses in the Central Canadian High Arctic|author=Calvert, Wendy  and Stirling, Ian |year=1990|pages=351<U+2013>356|volume=8|journal=Bears: Their Biology and Management|doi=10.2307/3872939 }}</ref> However, even an injured walrus is a formidable opponent for a polar bear, and direct attacks are rare. Walruses have been known to fatally injure polar bears in battles if the latter follows the other into the water where the bear is at a disadvantage.<ref name="North American Bear Center - Polar Bear Facts">{{cite web|title=North American Bear Center <U+2013> Polar Bear Facts|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/polar-bear/22-/70-polar-bear-facts.html|publisher=North American Bear Center}}</ref> Polar bear<U+2013>walrus battles are often extremely protracted and exhausting, and bears have been known to forgo the attack after injuring a walrus.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the walrus was heavily exploited by American and European [[Seal hunting|sealers]] and [[Whaling|whalers]], leading to the near [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of the Atlantic population.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Bockstoce, J.R. and Botkin, D.B.|year = 1982|title = The Harvest of Pacific Walruses by the Pelagic Whaling Industry, 1848 to 1914|journal = Arctic and Alpine Research|volume = 14|issue = 3|pages = 183<U+2013>188|doi = 10.2307/1551150|jstor = 1551150}}</ref> Commercial walrus harvesting is now outlawed throughout its range, although [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] and [[Inuit]] peoples<ref>

Traditional hunters used all parts of the walrus.<ref>{{cite web|last = US Fish and Wildlife Service|title = Hunting and Use of Walrus by Alaska Natives|year = 2007|url = http://alaska.fws.gov/fisheries/mmm/mtrp/pdf/factsheet_walrus.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The meat, often preserved, is an important winter nutrition source; the flippers are fermented and stored as a delicacy until spring; tusks and bone were historically used for tools, as well as material for handicrafts; the oil was rendered for warmth and light; the tough hide made rope and house and boat coverings; and the intestines and gut linings made waterproof parkas. While some of these uses have faded with access to alternative technologies, walrus meat remains an important part of local diets,<ref>{{cite journal|author = Eleanor, E.W., Freeman, M.M.R. and Makus, J.C. |year = 1996|title = Use and preference for Traditional Foods among Belcher Island Inuit|journal = Arctic|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 256<U+2013>264}}</ref> and tusk carving and engraving remain a vital art form.

Walrus hunts are regulated by resource managers in [[Russia]], the United States, Canada, and [[Denmark]], and representatives of the respective hunting communities. An estimated four to seven thousand Pacific walruses are harvested in [[Alaska]] and in Russia, including a significant portion (about 42%) of struck and lost animals.<ref>{{cite journal|journal = Fish.

The Boone and Crockett Big Game Record book has entries for Atlantic and Pacific walrus.

The effects of [[global climate change]] are another element of concern. The extent and thickness of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates.<ref>{{cite news|first = M|last = Kaufman|title = Warming Arctic Is Taking a Toll, Peril to Walrus Young Seen as Result of Melting Ice Shelf|url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/14/AR2006041401368.html|work = Washington Post|page = A7|date = 15 April 2006}}</ref> Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the [[Chukchi Sea]] between eastern Russia and western Alaska.<ref>Revkin, Andrew C..

Currently, two of the three walrus subspecies are listed as "least-concern" by the [[IUCN]], while the third is "data deficient".<ref name=iucn/> The Pacific walrus is not listed as "depleted" according to the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] nor as "threatened" or "endangered" under the [[Endangered Species Act]]. The Russian Atlantic and Laptev Sea populations are classified as Category 2 (decreasing) and Category 3 (rare) in the Russian [[Red Data Book of the Russian Federation|Red Book]].<ref name=MNRRF/> Global trade in [[walrus ivory]] is restricted according to a [[CITES]] Appendix 3 listing.

===Culture===

The walrus plays an important role in the religion and [[folklore]] of many [[Arctic]] peoples. Skin and bone are used in some ceremonies, and the animal appears frequently in legends. For example, in a [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] version of the widespread [[Raven in mythology|myth of the Raven]], in which [[Kutkh|Raven]] recovers the sun and the moon from an evil spirit by seducing his daughter, the angry father throws the daughter from a high cliff and, as she drops into the water, she turns into a walrus <U+2013> possibly the original walrus. According to various legends, the tusks are formed either by the trails of mucus from the weeping girl or her long braids.<ref name="Bogoras">{{cite journal|author=Bogoras, W.|year= 1902|title= The Folklore of Northeastern Asia, as Compared with That of Northwestern America|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=4|issue=4|pages=577<U+2013>683|doi=10.1525/aa.1902.4.4.02a00020|format=free download}}</ref> This myth is possibly related to the Chukchi myth of the old walrus-headed woman who rules the bottom of the sea, who is in turn linked to the Inuit goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]].

Because of its distinctive appearance, great bulk, and immediately recognizable whiskers and tusks, the walrus also appears in the popular cultures of peoples with little direct experience with the animal, particularly in English children's literature. Perhaps its best-known appearance is in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s whimsical poem "[[The Walrus and the Carpenter]]" that appears in his 1871 book ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. In the poem, the [[eponymous]] [[antiheroes]] use trickery to consume a great number of [[oyster]]s. Although Carroll accurately portrays the biological walrus's appetite for bivalve mollusks, oysters, primarily [[Littoral zone|nearshore]] and [[intertidal]] inhabitants, in fact comprise an insignificant portion of its diet, even in captivity.<ref>

The "walrus" in the cryptic Beatles song [[I Am the Walrus]] is a reference to the Lewis Carroll poem.

Another appearance of the walrus in literature is in the story "The White Seal" in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]'', where it is the "old Sea Vitch<U+2014>the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is asleep".<ref>Kipling, Rudyard.
