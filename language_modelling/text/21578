Bounded by four of the five [[Great Lakes]], plus [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake Saint Clair]], Michigan has the longest freshwater shoreline in the World, and the second longest total shoreline in the United States next to Alaska (excluding island shorelines),<ref>[http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/mystate/welcome.html NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management]</ref> and in 2005 had more registered recreational boats than any state except California and Florida.<ref> [http://www.discoverboating.com/info/pressrelease.aspx?id=14361]</ref> A person in Michigan is never more than 85 [[mile]]s (137 km) from open Great Lakes water and is never more than 6 miles (10 km) from a natural water source.

Michigan is the only bi-[[peninsula]]r state. The [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]], to which the name Michigan was originally applied, is sometimes dubbed "the mitten," owing to its shape. When asked where in Michigan one comes from, a resident of the Lower Peninsula may often point to the corresponding part of his or her hand. The [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] (U.P.) is separated from the Lower Peninsula by the [[Straits of Mackinac]], a five-mile channel that joins [[Lake Huron]] to [[Lake Michigan]]. The Upper Peninsula (whose residents are often called "Yoopers") is economically important for tourism and its natural resources. 

The Upper and Lower Peninsulas are connected by the five-mile-long [[Mackinac Bridge]], which is the third longest [[suspension bridge]] between anchorages in the world. This is the source of the name "[[troll]]s" for residents of the Lower Peninsula, for they live "under" (south of) the bridge. The Great Lakes that border Michigan are [[Lake Erie]], [[Lake Huron]], [[Lake Michigan]] and [[Lake Superior]]. Michigan also abuts [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake Saint Clair]], which is between Lake Erie and Lake Huron.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Michigan history}}

[[Image:Chippewa family c 1821.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Chippewa family, circa [[1821]]]]
Michigan was home to various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] centuries before [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization by Europeans]]. When the first European explorers arrived, the most populous and influential tribes were [[Algonquian peoples]]&mdash;specifically, the [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]], the [[Ojibwe|Anishnabe]] (called "Chippewa" in French, after their language, "Ojibwe"), and the [[Potawatomi]]. The Anishnabe, whose numbers are estimated to have been between 25,000 and 35,000, were the most populous.  Although the Anishnabe were well-established in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Peninsula, they also inhabited northern Ontario, northern Wisconsin, southern Manitoba, and northern and north-central Minnesota. The Ottawa lived primarily south of the Straits of Mackinac in northern and western Michigan, while the Potawatomi were primarily in the southwest. The three nations co-existed peacefully as part of a loose confederation called the [[Council of Three Fires]]. Other First Nations people in Michigan, in the south and east, were the [[Mascouten]], the [[Menominee]], the [[Miami (tribe)|Miami]], and the [[Wyandot]], who are better known by their French name, "Huron".
===1600s===

French [[Coureur des bois|voyageur]]s explored and settled in Michigan in the 17th century. The first Europeans to reach what later became Michigan were [[<U+00C9>tienne Br<U+00FB>l<U+00E9>]]'s expedition in 1622. The first European settlement was made in 1641 on the site where Father (or P<U+00E8>re, in French) [[Jacques Marquette]] established [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Sainte-Marie]] in 1668.

[[Saint Ignace, Michigan|Saint-Ignace]] was founded in 1671, and [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]] in 1675. Together with [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Sainte-Marie]], they are the three oldest cities in Michigan. "The Soo" (Sault Ste. Marie) has the distinction of being the oldest city in both Michigan and [[Ontario]]. It was split into two cities in 1818, a year after the U.S.-Canada boundary in the Great Lakes was finally established by the U.S.-UK Joint Border Commission.

In 1679, [[Robert Cavelier Sieur de la Salle|Lord La Salle of France]] directed the construction of the [[Le Griffon|Griffin]], the first European sailing vessel on the upper Great Lakes. That same year, La Salle built Fort Miami at present-day [[St. Joseph, Michigan|St. Joseph]].

===1700s===
In 1701, French explorer and army officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] founded [[Detroit, Michigan|Le Fort Ponchartrain du D<U+00E9>troit or <U+201C>Fort Ponchartrain on-the-Strait<U+201D>]] on the strait between Lakes [[Lake St. Clair|St. Clair]] and [[Lake Erie|Erie]], known as the [[Detroit River]]. Cadillac had convinced [[King Louis XIV]]'s chief minister, [[Louis Ph<U+00E9>lypeaux (1643-1727)|Louis Ph<U+00E9>lypeaux, Comte de Pontchartrain]], that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and repel [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] aspirations.

The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one [[arpent]]<ref name=tbaytel>{{cite web | url =http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/cadillac.htm | title =CADILLAC'S VILLAGE OR DETROIT UNDER CADILLAC. | accessdate = January 5| accessyear = 2007}}</ref><ref name=histdet>{{cite web | url = http://www.historydetroit.com/places/fort_ponchartrain.asp | title = History Detroit 1701-2001 | accessdate = January 5| accessyear = 2007}}</ref>  (about .85 acre, the equivalent of just under 200 feet on a side) and named it [[Fort Pontchartrain]]. Cadillac's wife, [[Marie Th<U+00E9>r<U+00E8>se]], soon moved to Detroit, becoming one of the first white women to settle in the Michigan wilderness. The town quickly became a major [[fur trade|fur-trading]] and shipping post. The <U+201C><U+00C9>glise de Saint-Anne,<U+201D> or Church of Saint Ann, was founded the same year, and while the original building does not survive, it remains an active congregation today. At the same time, the French strengthened [[Fort Michilimackinac]] at the [[Straits of Mackinac]] in order to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire. By the mid-eighteenth century, the French had also occupied forts at present-day [[Niles, Michigan|Niles]] and [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]]. However, most of the rest of the region remained unsettled by whites.

From 1660 to the end of French rule, Michigan (along with Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, two-thirds of Georgia, and small parts of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Maine) was part of the Royal Province of [[New France]], administered from the capital city of Qu<U+00E9>bec. In 1759, following the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754<U+2013>1763), Qu<U+00E9>bec City fell to British forces. Under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], Michigan and the rest of New France passed to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].

Detroit was an important British supply center during the [[American Revolutionary War]], but most of the inhabitants - almost all of them - were either Aboriginal people or French Canadians. Because of imprecise cartography and unclear language defining the boundaries in the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the British retained control of Detroit and Michigan. When Quebec was split into [[Lower Canada|Lower]] and [[Upper Canada]] in 1790, Michigan was part of [[Kent County, Ontario|Kent County]], Upper Canada, and held its first democratic elections in August 1792, to send delegates to the new provincial parliament at Newark, (Now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara-on-the-Lake]]).<ref name=SFarmer>{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = Silas | title = The history of Detroit and Michigan; or, The metropolis illustrated; a full record of territorial days in Michigan, and the annals of Wayne County | origyear = 1889 | url = http://name.umdl.umich.edu/bad1459.0001.001 | accessdate = 2006-06-15 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of Michigan Library | location = Ann Arbor, Mich. | pages = pp. 94 | chapter = Legislatures and Laws | chapterurl = http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=micounty;cc=micounty;rgn=full%20text;idno=BAD1459.0001.001;didno=BAD1459.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000152
}}</ref> Under terms negotiated in the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]], Britain withdrew from Detroit and Michilimackinac in 1796. However, questions remained over the boundary for many years and the United States did not have uncontested control of the Upper Peninsula and [[Drummond Island]] until 1818 and 1847, respectively. [[Image:4756 detroit 1020.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plan of the Town of Detroit and Fort Lernoult, 1792.]]

===1800s===
During the [[War of 1812]], [[Michigan Territory]] (effectively consisting of Detroit and the surrounding area) was captured by the British and nominally returned to [[Upper Canada]] until the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which implemented the policy of "Status Quo Ante Bellum" or "Just as Things Were Before the War." That meant Michigan stayed American, and the agreement to establish a joint U.S.-UK boundary commission also remained valid. Subsequent to the findings of that commission in 1817, control of the Upper Peninsula and of islands in the [[St. Clair River]] delta was transferred from Ontario to Michigan in 1818, and Drummond Island (to which the British had moved their Michilimackinac army base) was transferred in 1847.

The population grew slowly until the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which brought a large influx of settlers. By the 1830s, Michigan had some 80,000 residents, which was more than enough to apply for statehood. A state government was formed in 1836, although Congressional recognition of the state languished because of a boundary dispute with Ohio, with both sides claiming a 468 square mile (1,210 km<U+00B2>) strip of land that included the newly incorporated city of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] on Lake Erie and an area to the west then known as the "[[Great Black Swamp]]." The dispute came to be called the [[Toledo War]], with Michigan and Ohio militia maneuvering in the area but never coming to blows. Ultimately, Congress awarded the "[[Toledo Strip]]" to Ohio, and Michigan, having received the western part of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] as a concession, formally entered the Union on [[January 26]], [[1837]].

Thought to be useless at the time, the Upper Peninsula was soon discovered to be a rich and important source of [[lumber]], [[iron]], and [[copper]], which would become the state's most sought-after natural resources. [[Geologist]] [[Douglass Houghton]] and land surveyor [[William Austin Burt]] were among the first to document and discover many of these resources, which led to a nation-wide increase of interest in the state. Michigan lead the nation in lumber production from 1850's to the 1880's.

Michigan made [[Michigan in the American Civil War|a significant contribution]] to the Union in the American Civil War, sending over forty regiments of volunteers to the Federal armies.

[[Image:Henry Ford - Quadricycle, 1905.jpg|thumb|150px|Henry Ford in the Quadricycle, 1905]]
Michigan's economy underwent a massive change at the turn of the 20th century. The birth of the automotive industry, with [[Henry Ford]]'s first plant in the [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] [[enclave]] of Detroit, marked the beginning of a new era in transportation. It was a development that not only transformed Detroit and Michigan, but permanently altered the socio-economic climate of the United States and much of the world. [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], the second-largest city in Michigan, is also a center of automotive manufacturing. Since 1838, the city had also been noted for its thriving furniture industry (which has since declined substantially).

===1900s to the present===

In 1910 Michigan held its first primary election.

In 1920 Detroit<U+2019>s WWJ begins commercial broadcasting of regular programs, the first such radio station in the United States.
[[Image:Detroit financial district.JPG|thumb|left|210px|1920s skyscrapers in downtown [[Detroit]].]]
[[Detroit]] boomed through the 1950s, at one point doubling its population in a decade. In the 1920s some of the country's largest and most ornate skyscrapers were built in the city. Housing shortages and racial tension led to outward movement starting after World War II. After the 1950s, with suburban sprawl prevalent across the country, Detroit's population began to decline, and the rate increased after further racial strife in the 1960s and high crime rates in the 70s and 80s. Government programs such as road-building often enabled the sprawl. 

Since the 1970s, Michigan's industrial base has eroded as the auto industry began to abandon the state's industrial parks in favor of less expensive labor found overseas and in the southern U.S. states. Nevertheless, with more than 10 million residents, Michigan continues to grow and remains a large and influential state, ranking eighth in population among the 50 states.  

The [[Detroit]] metropolitan area in the southeast corner of the state remains the largest metropolitan area in Michigan (roughly 50% of the population resides there) and one of the 10 largest metro areas in the country.  The [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]/[[Holland, Michigan|Holland]]/[[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]] metro area on the west side of the state is the fastest growing metro area in the state presently, with over 1.3 million residents as of 2006.

[[Metro Detroit]]'s population is now growing very little, and [[Detroit]]'s population is still shrinking, though strong redevelopment in central part of the cities, and a significant rise in population in the southwest part of the city, is contributing to some population inflow. A period of economic transition, especially in manufacturing, has caused this region's economy to perform worse than the national average for several years.

=== Law ===
[[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] is the [[list of capitals in the United States|state capital]] and is home to all three branches of state government. The [[Michigan State Capitol]] was dedicated in 1879 and has hosted the state's executive and legislative branches ever since. The chief executive is the [[Governors of Michigan|Governor]], and [[Jennifer Granholm]] currently holds the office. The legislative branch consists of the [[bicameral]] [[Michigan Legislature]], with a [[Michigan State House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Michigan Senate|Senate]]. The Michigan legislature is a full-time legislature, though some representatives have voiced concerns about the long hours disrupting their home lives and wish to make the job part-time. The [[Supreme Court of Michigan]] sits with seven justices. The [[Michigan Constitution|Constitution of Michigan of 1963]] provides for voter initiative and [[referendum]] (Article II, <U+00A7> 9,<ref>[http://www.legislature.mi.gov/printDocument.aspx?objName=mcl-article-ii-9&version=txt Article II, <U+00A7> 9 of state constitution]</ref> defined as "the power to propose laws and to enact and reject laws, called the initiative, and the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. The power of initiative extends only to laws which the legislature may enact under this constitution").

Michigan's state universities are immune from control by the legislature, many aspects of the executive branch, and cities in which they are located; but they are not immune from the authority of the courts. Some degree of political control is exercised as the legislature approves appropriations for the schools. Furthermore, the governor appoints the board of trustees of most state universities with the advice and consent of the state Senate.  Only the trustees of the [[University of Michigan]], [[Michigan State University]], and [[Wayne State University]] are chosen in general elections.

Michigan was the first state in the Union, as well as the first English-speaking government in the world<ref>http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=11&did=276</ref><ref>http://www.amnestyusa.org/abolish/event2/history.html</ref>, to abolish the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], in 1846. David G. Chardavoyne has suggested that the abolitionist movement in Michigan grew as a result of enmity towards the state's neighbor, Canada, which under British rule made public executions a regular practice.<ref>http://lists.compar.com/cuadpupdate/2005-March/000115.html</ref>

The Executive Branch of the State of Michigan has several Departments or agencies [http://www.michigan.gov/som/0,1607,7-192-29701_29702---,00.html]:

=== Politics ===

[[Image:Mich gov jen granholm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]]]
The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated Michigan until the [[Great Depression]]. In 1912, Michigan was one of the few states to support progressive Republican and third party candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for President after he lost the Republican nomination to [[William Howard Taft]]. In recent years, the state has leaned toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in national elections. Michigan has supported Democrats in the last four presidential elections. In 2004, [[John Kerry]] carried the state over [[George W. Bush]], winning Michigan's 17 electoral votes with 51.2% of the vote. Democrats have won each of the last three, and nine of the last ten, US Senate elections in Michigan.  Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]], also a Democrat, recently won a second term, beating out Republican candidate [[Dick DeVos]].  Republican strength is greatest in the western, northern, and rural parts of the state, especially in the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] area. Democrats are strongest in the east, especially in [[Detroit]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], and [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]].

==Administrative divisions==
=== County government ===
[[Image:Michigan-counties-map.gif|right|thumb|250px|Michigan's 83 counties]]
State government is decentralized among three tiers <U+2014> statewide, county and township. Counties are administrative divisions of the state, and townships are administrative divisions of a county. Both of them exercise state government authority, localized to meet the particular needs of their jurisdictions, as provided by state law. There are 83 [[List of Michigan counties|counties in Michigan]].

''See also:  [[Administrative divisions of Michigan]], [[List of Michigan county seats]], and [[List of counties in Michigan]]''

=== Local and Municipal government ===
Cities, state universities, and villages are vested with home rule powers of varying degrees. [[Home rule]] cities can generally do anything that is not prohibited by law. The fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational institutions that is not prohibited by the state constitution. [[Village]]s, by contrast, have limited home rule, in that they are not completely autonomous from the county and township in which they are located.

There are two types of [[Civil township|township]] in Michigan: ''general law'' township and ''charter''. [[Charter township]] status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April [[2001]], there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water & sewage department, police department, and so on<U+2014>just like a city<U+2014>but it is not ''required'' to have those things, whereas cities ''must'' provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.

[[Image:Michigan map.png|right|275px|thumb|Michigan map, including territorial waters]]
[[Image:Sleeping Bear Dune Aerial View.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Aerial View of [[Sleeping Bear Dunes]]]]

Michigan consists of two peninsulas that lie between 82<U+00B0>30' to about 90<U+00BA>30' west longitude, and are separated by the Straits of Mackinac.

The state is bounded on the south by the states of [[Ohio]] and [[Indiana]], sharing both land and water boundaries with both. Michigan's western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries, from south to north, with Illinois and Wisconsin in Lake Michigan; then a land boundary with Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, that is principally demarcated by the [[Menominee River|Menominee]] and [[Montreal River|Montreal]] rivers; then water boundaries again, in [[Lake Superior]], with [[Wisconsin]] and [[Minnesota]] to the west, capped around by the Canadian province of [[Ontario]] to the north and east. 
The northern boundary then runs completely through Lake Superior, from the western boundary with [[Minnesota]] to a point north of and around [[Isle Royale]], (which is Michigans only [[National Park]]), thence traveling southeastward through the lake in a reasonably straight line to the Sault Ste. Marie area. [[Windsor, Ontario]], once the south bank of Detroit, Upper Canada, has the distinction of being the only part of Canada which lies to the ''due south'' of a part of the lower 48 contiguous United States. In [[Southeastern Michigan]] there is a water boundary with the Canada along the entire lengths of the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]] (including the [[First Nation]] reserve of [[Walpole Island]]) and the [[Detroit River]]. The south-eastern boundary ends in the western end of [[Lake Erie]] with a three-way convergence of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario.

Michigan encompasses 58,110 [[square mile]]s (150,504 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]]) of land, 38,575 square miles (99,909 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]]) of Great Lakes waters and 1,305 square miles (3,380 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]]) of inland waters. Only the state of Alaska has more territorial water. After Michigan is third ranked Florida which has 11,827.77 square miles (30,633.8&nbsp;km<U+00B2>).<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108355.html Land and Water Area of States, 2000]</ref>
At a total of 97,990 square miles (253,793 [[square kilometer|km<U+00B2>]]), Michigan is the largest state east of the [[Mississippi River]] (inclusive of its territorial waters). It is the 10th largest state in the Union. Michigan claims a land area of 58,110 square miles of land and 97,990 sq mi total, making it the tenth largest state,<ref>[http://www.michigan.gov/documents/hal_lm_MiB_156795_7.pdf Michigan in Brief]</ref> but the U.S. Census Bureau claims only 56,803.82 sq mi of land and 96,716.11 sq mi total, making it the 11th largest. </ref>

The heavily forested Upper Peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west. The [[Porcupine Mountains]], which are the oldest mountains in North America, rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 [[foot (unit of length|feet]] above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The surface on either side of this range is rugged. The state's highest point, in the [[Huron Mountains]] northwest of Marquette, is [[Mount Arvon]] at 1,979 feet (603 [[Metre|m]]). The peninsula is as large as [[Connecticut]], [[Delaware]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Rhode Island]] combined, but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants, who are sometimes called "Yoopers" (from "U.P.'ers") and whose speech (the "[[Yooper dialect]]") has been heavily influenced by the large number of Scandinavian and Canadian immigrants who settled the area during the mining boom of the late 1800s.

The Lower Peninsula, shaped like a mitten, is 277 [[mile]]s (446 [[kilometre|km]]) long from north to south and 195 miles (314 km) from east to west and occupies nearly two-thirds of the state's land area. The surface of the peninsula is generally level, broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall. It is divided by a low water divide running north and south. The larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward Lake Michigan. The highest point in the Lower Peninsula is not definitely established but is either Briar Hill at 1,705 [[foot (unit of length)|feet]] (520 [[Metre|m]]), or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]]. The lowest point is the surface of Lake Erie at 571 feet (174 m).

The geographic orientation of Michigan's peninsulas make for a long distance between the ends of the state. [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]], in the far western Upper Peninsula, lies 630 highway miles (1,015 km) from the [[Toledo, Ohio]] suburb of [[Lambertville, Michigan|Lambertville]] in the Lower Peninsula's southeastern corner. The geographic isolation of the Upper Peninsula from Michigan's political and population centers makes it culturally and economically distinct, and the feeling that Lansing and Detroit do not care about the U.P. has led to occasional calls for [[secession]] from Michigan and admission as a new state called "[[Superior (proposed state)|Superior]]."

There are numerous lakes and marshes in both peninsulas, and the coast is much indented. Keweenaw, [[Whitefish Bay|Whitefish]], and the Big and [[Little Bay De Noc|Little]] Bays De Noc are the principal indentations on the Upper Peninsula, while the [[Grand Traverse Bay|Grand]] and [[Little Traverse Bay|Little Traverse]], [[Thunder Bay (Michigan)|Thunder]], and [[Saginaw Bay|Saginaw]] bays indent the Lower Peninsula. After [[Alaska]], Michigan has the longest shoreline of any state<U+2014>3,288 miles (5,326 km). An additional 1,056 miles (1,699 km) can be added if islands are included. This roughly equals the length of the Atlantic Coast from Maine to Florida. The state has numerous large islands, the principal ones being the [[Manitou Islands|Manitou]], [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver]], and [[Fox Islands (Michigan)|Fox]] groups in Lake Michigan; [[Isle Royale]] and [[Grand Island (Michigan)|Grande Isle]] in Lake Superior; Marquette, [[Bois Blanc Island (Michigan)|Bois Blanc]], and [[Mackinac Island|Mackinac]] Islands in Lake Huron; and [[Neebish Island|Neebish]], [[Sugar Island (Michigan)|Sugar]], and [[Drummond Island]]s in [[St. Marys River (Michigan-Ontario)|St. Mary's River]] (''see also [[Islands of Michigan]]'').

The state's rivers are small, short and shallow, and few are navigable. The principal ones include the [[Au Sable River (Michigan)|Au Sable]], [[Thunder Bay River|Thunder Bay]], [[Cheboygan River|Cheboygan]], and [[Saginaw River|Saginaw]], all of which flow into Lake Huron; the [[Ontonagon River|Ontonagon]], and [[Tahquamenon River|Tahquamenon]], which flow into Lake Superior; and the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph]], [[Kalamazoo River|Kalamazoo]], [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand]], and [[Escanaba River|Escanaba]], which flow into Lake Michigan. (''See [[List of Michigan rivers]]''). The state has 11,037 inland lakes and 38,575 square miles (62,067 km) of Great Lakes waters and rivers and 1,305 square miles of inland water on top of that. No point in Michigan is more than 6 miles (10 km) from an inland lake or more than 85 miles (137 km) from one of the Great Lakes.

Detroit is the only major city in the United States from which one must travel southward to cross the border into Canada. Metropolitan Detroit/Ann Arbor/Flint/Windsor is also the world's largest international metropolitan area.

The state is home to one [[national park]]: [[Isle Royale National Park]]. Other national [[protected areas]] in the state include: [[Keweenaw National Historical Park]], [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]], [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]], and [[Father Marquette National Memorial]]. The [[North Country National Scenic Trail]] also passes through Michigan. Michigan also has the largest state park system of any state.

===Climate===
Michigan has a [[humid continental climate]] throughout the state, although there are two distinct regions. The southern and central parts of the Lower Peninsula (south of [[Saginaw Bay]] and from the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] area southward) has a warmer climate ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with hot, humid summers and cold, but shorter winters. The northern part of Lower Peninsula and the entire Upper Peninsula has a more severe climate (Koppen ''Dfb''), with warm, humid but shorter summers and long, cold to very cold winters. Some parts of the state averaging high temperatures below freezing from December through February, and into early March in the far northern parts. During the late fall through the middle of February the state is frequently subjected to heavy [[lake effect snow]]. The state receives a good amount of precipitation throughout the year, averaging from 30-40 inches (750-1000 mm) annually. Typically, from December through March is slightly drier, while July through September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, although this difference isn't extreme as in some other states.

The entire state averages around 30 days of thunderstorm activity per year, and these can be severe, especially the further south in the state one goes. The state averages 17 tornadoes a year, and these are much more common in the extreme southern portion of the state with portions of the southern border nearly as vulnerable historically as parts of [[Tornado alley]]. Further north, in the Upper Peninsula, tornadoes are rare, but have occurred. <ref name= "Thunderstorm hazards"> [http://www.srh.noaa.gov/key/HTML/tstmhazards.htm] srh.noaa.gov.

===Geology===
The geological formation of the state is greatly varied. Primary boulders are found over the entire surface of the Upper Peninsula (being principally of primitive origin), while Secondary deposits cover the entire Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula exhibits Lower [[Silurian]] sandstones, limestones, copper and iron bearing rocks, corresponding to the Huronian system of Canada. The central portion of the Lower Peninsula contains coal measures and rocks of the [[Permo-Carboniferous]] period. [[Devonian]] and sub-Carboniferous deposits are scattered over the entire state.

The soil is of a varied composition and in large areas is very fertile, especially in the south. However, the Upper Peninsula for the most part is rocky and mountainous, and the soil is unsuitable for agriculture. The climate is tempered by the proximity of the lakes and is much milder than in other locales with the same latitude. The principal forest trees include basswood, maple, elm, sassafras, butternut, walnut, poplar, hickory, oak, willow, pine, birch, beech, hemlock, witchhazel, tamarack, cedar, locust, dogwood, and ash.

As of the July 1, 2006 population estimate, Michigan has an estimated population of 10,095,643, which is a decrease of 25,217, or -0.05%, from the prior year, but an increase of 157,199, or 1.6%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 235,760 people (that is 691,897 births minus 456,137 deaths) and a decrease from net [[migration]] of 42,183 people out of the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 354,544 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 165,084 people. The state's population increased by 817,000 between 1990 and 2004, an 8.8% growth. As of 2000, the state had the 8th largest population in the Union.

The [[center of population]] of Michigan is located in [[Shiawassee County, Michigan|Shiawassee County]], in the southeastern corner of the [[civil township]] of [[Bennington Township, MI|Bennington]], which is located directly north of the village of [[Morrice, Michigan|Morrice]]<ref>[http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt State Centers]</ref>.

As of 2006, the state had a foreign-born population of 688,413. In recent years, the foreign born population has grown in the state.

Michigan has a large [[white people|white]] population (81.3%).  Americans of European descent including German, [[French American|French]], and [[Briton|British]] ancestry are present throughout most of Michigan and [[Metro Detroit]]. People of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] (especially [[Finnish American|Finnish]]), [[British American|British]] (notably [[Cornish people|Cornish]]), and ancestry have a notable presence in the Upper Peninsula. Western Michigan is known for the [[Dutch American|Dutch]] heritage of many residents (the highest concentration of any state), especially in the Grand Rapids-[[Holland, Michigan|Holland]] area. [[Metro Detroit]] also has residents of [[Polish American|Polish]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, while Dearborn has a large [[Arab American]] community. African-Americans form a majority of the population of the city of Detroit and of some other cities, including [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and [[Benton Harbor, Michigan|Benton Harbor]].

Visitors spend $17.5 billion a year in the state supporting 193,000 tourism jobs and Michigan's tourism website ranks among the busiest in the nation.<ref>Great Lakes IT Report. (May 3, 2007,).[http://www.glitr.com/Article.asp?id=401608&spid Michigan's Tourism Website No. 1 in the U.S]. Retrieved on August 10, 2007.</ref>  Destinations such as [[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]], [[Mackinac Island]], [[Ludington, Michigan|Ludington]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Saugatuck, Michigan|Saugatuck]], the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], [[Frankenmuth]], [[Grand Haven]], [[Grand Rapids]], and  [[Detroit]] draw vacationers, hunters, and nature enthusiasts from across the United States and [[Canada]].  Michigan is fifty percent [[forest]] land, much of it quite remote. Both the forests and thousands of miles of beaches are top attractions. Tourists also flock to many of the museums, particularly those in [[Metro Detroit]], including [[The Henry Ford]], the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] and the [[Arab American National Museum]]. The Metro Detroit area offers four major casinos, MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown, Motor City, and Casino Windsor; moreover, [[Detroit]] is the largest city to offer casino gambling.  

[[Hunting]] is a major component of Michigan's economy. Michigan ranks first in the nation in licensed hunters (over one million) who contribute [[United States dollar|$]]2 billion annually to its economy. Over three-quarters of a million hunters participate in [[white-tailed deer]] season alone. Many K-12 school districts in rural areas of Michigan go so far as to cancel school on the opening day of rifle season, because of both safety and attendance concerns.

Michigan's Department of Natural Resources manages the largest dedicated state forest system in the nation. The forest products industry and recreational users contribute $12 billion and 200,000 associated jobs annually to the state's economy. Michigan has more than 90 native species of trees, more than all of [[Europe]] combined.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Michigan's gross state product in 2004 was [[United States dollar|$]]372 billion.<ref>http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/gspnewsrelease.htm</ref> Per capita personal income in 2003 was $31,178 and ranked twentieth in the nation.

Michigan's  [[income tax|tax]] rate on personal income of 3.90 percent gives it one of the lowest top brackets in the nation. Some cities impose additional income taxes.   Michigan's state [[sales tax]] is 6 percent. The state does not allow city or local sales taxes. [[Property tax]]es are assessed on the local, not state, level. In 2007, Michigan repealed its Single Business Tax (SBT) and replaced it with an all new Michigan Business Tax (MBT) in order to stimulate job growth by reducing taxes for seventy percent of the businesses in the State.<ref>Office of the Governor (June 15, 2007).

==Transportation==
[[Image:Mackinaw Bridge storm.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Mackinac Bridge, a five-mile span connecting Michigan's two peninsulas]]
===Railroads===
{{main|Michigan Services}}
The state is traversed by several railroads, with mileage amounting to several hundreds of miles.  

[[Freight rail]] traffic represents the use of most of the railroads. 

There is [[Amtrak]] [[passenger rail]] service in the state, connecting the cities of [[Detroit]], [[East Lansing]], [[Grand Rapids]], [[Jackson]], [[Ann Arbor]], [[Kalamazoo]], and [[Port Huron]] to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and to [[Toronto, Ontario]] via [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]].  There are plans for [[commuter rail]] for Detroit and its [[suburbs]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070122/NEWS06/701220388/1001/BUSINESS05 Freep]</ref><ref>[http://www.marp.org/detroitcommuter.htm SOME COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE FACTS RELEVANT TO DETROIT]</ref>

AMTRAK passenger rail service no longer continues east of Port Huron to Toronto via Sarnia.  Lengthy customs delays made it impossible for AMTRAK and VIA trains to maintain their schedules.  AMTRAK trains originate and terminate at Port Huron.  VIA trains terminate and originate at Sarnia.

===Interstate Highways===
[[Interstate 75]] is the main thoroughfare between Detroit and Flint, extending all the way to Sault Saint Marie and providing access to [[Sault Saint Marie, Ontario]].  The expressway crosses the [[Mackinac Bridge]] between the Lower and Upper Peninsulas. Branching highways include I-275 and I-375 in Detroit; I-475 in Flint; I-675 in Saginaw.

[[Interstate 69]] enters the state near the Michigan-Ohio-Indiana border, and it extends to [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] and provides access to the [[Blue Water Bridge]] crossing into [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

[[Interstate 94]] enters the western end of the state at the Indiana border, and it travels east to Detroit and then northeast to Port Huron and ties in with I-69.  I-194 branches off from this freeway in Battle Creek.

[[Interstate 96]] runs east-west between Detroit and Muskegon. I-496 loops around Lansing. [[Interstate 196|I-196]] branches off from this freeway at Grand Rapids and connects to I-94 near Benton Harbor.  I-696 branches off from this freeway at Novi and connects to I-94 near [[St Clair Shores]] and [[Eastpointe]].

===U.S. Routes===
Include: [[U.S. Route 2|US 2]], [[U.S. Route 8|US 8]], [[U.S. Route 10|US 10]], [[U.S. Route 12|US 12]], [[U.S. Route 23|US 23]], [[U.S. Route 24|US 24]], [[U.S. Route 31|US 31]], [[U.S. Route 41|US 41]], [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], [[U.S. Route 127|US 127]], [[U.S. Route 131|US 131]], [[U.S. Route 141|US 141]], [[U.S. Route 223|US 223]].
