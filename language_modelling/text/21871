'''''MTV Unplugged +3''''' is the second live [[DVD]]/[[video]] release by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]], released in the United States on June 26, 1992 by [[Columbia Records]]. Following the success of Carey's previous two albums and the growing critical commentary on her lack of concert tours and unsubstantial televised performances, Sony BMG organized a performance show at the Kaufman Astoria Studios, New York on March 16, 1992. The show, titled ''MTV Unplugged'', originally aired on [[MTV]] to help promote Carey's then album ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991). However, after its success, the show was released to the public as an [[MTV Unplugged (Mariah Carey EP)|EP]], with an accompanying VHS titled ''MTV Unplugged +3''.

In an attempt to prove Carey's live vocals were not derived from studio synthesizers, the performance earned generally positive review from music critics. They praised Carey's live vocal ability, and felt the EP and video helped showcase her talent. ''MTV Unplugged +3'' topped the Music Video sales chart of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', and was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of over 100,000 copies throughout the country.

==Background==
After the release of Carey's second [[studio album]], ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991), critics began wondering whether Carey would finally embark on a worldwide tour, having not toured to promote her self-titled [[Mariah Carey (album)|debut album]].<ref name="nickson">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=70}}</ref> Although Carey had done several sporadic award show appearances, as well as television program performances, critics began accusing Carey of being a studio artist, not capable of delivering or replicating the same quality vocals live, especially her [[whistle register]].<ref name="nickson"/> During several televised interviews, Carey addressed the accusations, claiming that she did not tour out of fear of the long travel times and distances, as well as the strain on her voice performing her songs back-to-back. However, in hopes of putting any claims of her being a manufactured artist to rest, Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]] decided to book an appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', a television program aired by [[MTV]].<ref name="nickson"/> The show's purpose was to present well-known artists, and feature them "unplugged" or stripped of studio equipment. While live, the show allowed several musicians and back up vocalists, while recorded in an acoustic setting.<ref name="nickson2">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=71}}</ref> The issues Carey faced once the show was booked was the content; she didn't know what material to present at the intimate concert. While Carey felt strongly of her more soulful and powerful songs, it was decided that her most popular content to that point would be included.<ref name="nickson2"/> Days prior to the show's taping, Carey and Afanasieff thought of adding a cover version of an older song, in order to provide something different and unexpected. They chose "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]", a song made popular by [[The Jackson 5]] in 1970, rehearsing it few times before the night of the show.<ref name="nickson2"/>

Carey's performance was recorded on March 16, 1992 at [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in Queens, New York.<ref name="nickson3">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=72}}</ref> The show featured a number of musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. It was directed by [[Larry Jordan]], who had previously worked with Carey on the music video for "[[Someday (Mariah Carey song)|Someday]]".<ref name="nickson3"/> Dana Jon Chapelle was chosen as the sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two [[studio albums]].<ref name="nickson3"/> The show began with the song "[[Emotions (Mariah Carey song)|Emotions]]" (1991); Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots.<ref name="nickson3"/> Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and [[a capella]] number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]]. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the [[harpsichord]] and [[Pump organ|harmonium]].<ref name="nickson3"/> The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the [[drum]]s, [[Randy Jackson]] on [[Bass (sound)|bass]], Vernon Black on [[guitar]], and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both [[Percussion instrument|percussionists]]. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by [[Trey Lorenz]] and Patrique McMillan.<ref name="nickson3"/> The next song on the set-list was "[[If It's Over]]" (1991), a collaboration with [[Carole King]]. [[Walter Afanasieff]] replaced Cole on the [[piano]], during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage.<ref name="nickson4">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=73}}</ref> They were Lew Delgado, [[baritone]] [[saxophone]]; [[Lenny Pickett]], [[tenor]] saxophone; George Young, [[alto]] saxophone; Earl Gardner, [[trumpet]]; and Steve Turre, [[trombone]].<ref name="nickson4"/> They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after.<ref name="nickson4"/> For "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]].<ref name="nickson5">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=74}}</ref> During the song, Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register.<ref name="nickson5"/> She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a [[Vocal range|higher ranged]] note.<ref name="nickson5"/> Once again, as Carey began "[[Vision of Love]]" (1990), her "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole.<ref name="nickson6">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=75}}</ref> The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in [[a cappella]] form, without any heavy instrumentation.<ref name="nickson6"/> Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, "[[Make It Happen (Mariah Carey song)|Make It Happen]]" (1992), Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble.<ref name="nickson6"/> After the song began, the back-up began "piling their vocals" over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more "churchy feel".<ref name="nickson6"/> He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals:
<blockquote>
"The roughness of this version succeeded in a way the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished."<ref name="nickson6"/>
</blockquote>
Soon after completing "Make It Happen", Carey eagerly presented the final song on the set list, "I'll Be There". The way the song was arranged, Carey took [[Michael Jackson]]'s lead, while [[Trey Lorenz]] sang the second lead, originally sung by [[Jermaine Jackson]].<ref name="nickson7">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=76}}</ref> After performing the sung alongside a very simple arrangement and minimal instrumentals, the back-up singers began humming to the tune of "[[Can't Let Go (Mariah Carey song)|Can't Let Go]]" (1991), leading Carey to present "another final" song for the show.<ref name="nickson7"/> Several days after the concert, Carey sat down with Melinda Newman from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective.<ref name="nickson7"/> She said "''Unplugged'' taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist. I'll always go over the raw stuff, and now I've gotten to the point where I understand the raw stuff is usually better."<ref name="nickson7"/>

==Release==
{{Main|MTV Unplugged (EP)}}
Originally, [[MTV]] planned to air the show several times during April 1992, it was normal for ''MTV Unplugged'' sessions to air around six times during the month of release, before being archived.<ref name="nickson8">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=78<U+2013>79}}</ref> Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual.<ref name="nickson8"/> Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, and by the end of April 1992, Carey's episode of ''MTV Unplugged'' had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993.<ref name="nickson8"/> This being so, Sony decided to release it as an [[Extended play|EP]], selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.<ref name="nickson8"/> After the success of the EP's lead single "I'll Be There", Sony chose to release not only the EP, but a VHS accompaniment package; a video of the actual concert titled ''MTV Unplugged +3''.<ref name="nickson8"/> Aside from featuring the seven song's performed at Kaufman Astoria Studios, it held three music videos; "Can't Let Go", "Make It Happen", and a rare remix version and video of "Emotions".<ref name="nickson8"/>
