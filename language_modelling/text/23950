'''Frederick (Fred) Cossom Hollows''', [[Order of Australia|AC]] ([[April 9]] [[1929]] Dunedin New Zealand &ndash;[[February 10]] [[1993]] New South Wales Australia)  was an [[ophthalmologist]] who became known for his work in restoring eyesight for countless thousands of people in [[Australia]] and many other countries. It has been estimated that more than one million people in the world can see today because of initiatives instigated by Hollows, the most notable example being [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]].

==Early life==
Fred Hollows was one of four children, the others being Colin, John, and Maurece. All were born in [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]], to Joseph and Clarice (Marshall) Hollows. Joseph Hollows was a truck driver. The family lived in [[Dunedin]] for the first seven years of his life. He had one year of informal primary schooling at North East Valley Primary School and began attending [[Palmerston North Boys' High School]] when he was 13, where he joined several clubs.{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Hollows received his BA degree from [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. He briefly studied at a seminary, but decided against a life in the clergy. After observing the doctors at a mental hospital during some charity work, he instead enrolled at [[Otago Medical School]]. While living in [[Dunedin]] he was an active member of the [[New Zealand Alpine Club]] and made several first ascents of mountains in the [[Mount Aspiring]] region of [[Central Otago]].

Hollows was a member of the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/1993/88/4605 Editorial: Fred Hollows] - GreenLeft online. 17 February 1993]</ref>

In 1961 he went to [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] in [[England]] to study ophthalmology. He then did post-graduate work in [[Wales]] before moving to [[Australia]] in [[1965]] where he became associate professor of [[ophthalmology]] at the [[University of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]]. From 1965-1992 he chaired the ophthalmology division overseeing the teaching departments at the University of New South Wales, and the [[Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney|Prince of Wales]] and [[Prince Henry Hospital, Sydney|Prince Henry]] hospitals.

Hollows was married twice: in 1958 to Mary Skiller, who died in 1975, and in 1980 to [[Gabi Hollows|Gabi O<U+2019>Sullivan]].

==Medical Career==
{{Unreferencedsection|date=June 2008}}  
Early in the 1970s, Hollows visited isolated New South Wales towns, stations and Aboriginal communities. He became especially concerned with the high number of Aborigines who had eye disorders, particularly [[trachoma]].  In 1971, with [[Mum (Shirl) Smith]] and others, he set up the [[Aboriginal Medical Service]] in suburban [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] in Sydney, and was subsequently responsible for the establishment of medical services for Aboriginal People throughout Australia. Hollows himself spent three years visiting Aboriginal communities to provide eye care and carry out a survey of eye defects. More than 460 Aboriginal communities were visited, and 62,000 Aboriginal People were examined, leading to 27,000 being treated for [[trachoma]] and 1,000 operations being carried out. 

===Overseas work===
His visits to [[Nepal]] in 1985, [[Eritrea]] in 1987, and [[Vietnam]] in 1991 resulted in training programs to train local technicians to perform eye surgery. Hollows organized [[intraocular lens]] laboratories in Eritrea and Nepal to manufacture and provide lenses at cost, which was about A$10 (approximately US$9) each. Both laboratories started production after his death, in 1993.   
    
In 1992, [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]] was established to provide eye care for the underprivileged and poor, and to improve the health of indigenous Australians.

==Controversy==
A controversy unfolded in March 1992, when Hollows spoke at the [[Alice Springs National Aboriginal HIV/AIDS Conference]]. His approach to this topic was straight to the point. Hollows argued that some areas of the [[AIDS]] campaign were being inadequately dealt with. According to ''The Australian''<U+2019>s Martin Thomas, Hollows stated that some homosexuals were <U+201C>recklessly spreading the virus<U+201D>. Therefore, the safe sex campaign was an inadequate way of dealing with the issue. To contain the disease, Hollows argued that promiscuity needed to be addressed. Hollows observed the spread of AIDS in contemporary African communities and he was concerned that AIDS would spread as vehemently through Aboriginal communities. Clearly, Hollows infuriated some sections of the community with his comments, but apparently did not cause widespread condemnation.<ref>[http://www.henrythornton.com/article.asp?article_id=4246 The Hissink File - August 2006]</ref><ref>[http://www.adf.com.au/archive.php?doc_id=100 AIDS - Have we got it Right?] - ADF</ref>

==Death==
Hollows died in [[Sydney]] in 1993 at the age of 64. The cause of his death was [[metastatic]] [[renal cancer]] primarily affecting his lungs and brain. He had been diagnosed with the disease six years earlier.  Upon his death the [[Chief Minister of the ACT]], [[Rosemary Follett]], described Hollows to her parliamentary colleagues as "an egalitarian and a self-named [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] who wanted to see an end to the economic disparity which exists between the First and Third Worlds and who believed in no power higher than the best expressions of the human spirit found in personal and social relationships." 

Hollows was given a state funeral service at [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney| St Mary's Cathedral]] in Sydney, and, in accordance with his wishes, was interred in [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]], where he had worked in the early 1970s.<ref>[http://www.hollows.org/Fred_Bourke/ Fred in Bourke] - The Fred Hollows Foundation International</ref> He was survived by his wife [[Gabi Hollows]] (an [[Australian_Living_Treasures|''Australian Living Treasure'']]), and children Tanya, Ben, Cam, Emma, Anna-Louise, Ruth and Rosa, and his two Grandchildren Nicholas and Isabella.
