'''Pennsylvania Route 894''' ('''PA 894''') is a decommissioned Pennsylvania state route.  It was established in 1928, starting at what is now [[U.S. Route 22 (Pennsylvania)|US 22]].  At the time PA 894 was established, US 22 was [[Pennsylvania Route 43|PA 43]].  From 1928 to 1936, PA 894 ran from it's southern terminus at PA 43 north through [[Linglestown, Pennsylvania|Linglestown]].  PA 894 then turned to the east, at what is know known as Linglestown Road, ending just outside of Linglestown.  

In 1936, [[Pennsylvania Route 39|PA 39]] was established, creating a concurrency between PA 39 and PA 894, starting in Linglestown at the square, headed east out of Linglestown.  PA 894 was also extended, making a northerly turn off PA 39 on what is now known as Piketown Road.  PA 894 then ran through [[Piketown, Pennsylvania|Piketown]], over [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]], and ending at [[Pennsylvania Route 443|PA 443]], today called Fishing Creek Valley Road.  

In 1946, however, PA 894 was decommissioned.  The section of PA 894 from US 22 to PA 39 was given a quadrant route number.  That section of road is known today as Mountain Road.  The Piketown Road section also was given a quadrant route number.  PA 39 was not decommissioned.
