'''John Lennon''' was an [[England|English]] rock [[musician]] who gained worldwide fame as one of the founders of [[The Beatles]] and for his subsequent solo career, along with his widely-known protests against the [[Vietnam War]], among other political activies. He was shot dead in front of his home, [[the Dakota]] by [[Mark David Chapman]] on [[December 8]] [[1980]]. Millions of music fans worldwide mourned his death.

==December 8, 1980==

===The Beginning of the End===
On the morning of [[December 8]], [[1980]], [[Annie Leibovitz]] came over to Ono and Lennon's apartment to do a photo shoot for the [[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone magazine]]. She had promised Lennon it would make the cover<ref name="buzzle">{{cite web |date=12/8/2005| url = http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-8-2005-83469.asp| title = Hours After This Picture Was Taken John Lennon Was Dead| format = HTML | publisher = Guardian Unlimited| accessdate = 2007-07-26 | last= }}</ref> but she initially tried to get a picture with just Lennon alone. Leibovitz would recall that, "nobody wanted [Ono] on the cover".<ref name="FamousPictures">{{cite web |date=2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/mag/index.php?title=John_Lennon| title = Naked Lennon| format = HTML | publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-07-26 | last=Lucas, Dean }}</ref> When Lennon insisted that both be on the cover Leibovitz then tried to recreate the kissing scene from the ''[[Double Fantasy]]'' album cover, a picture that she loved.<ref name="FamousPictures"/>
{{Cquote2|What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on' ... not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong.

... I shot some test Polaroids first and when I showed them to John and Yoko, John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly'. I looked him in the eye and we shook on it.<ref name="buzzle"/>|Annie Leibovitz}}

With the pictures in hand, Annie Leibovitz left their apartment.

At 5:00 p.m., Lennon and wife [[Yoko Ono]] left their apartment to mix the track "[[Walking on Thin Ice]]" at [[Record Plant Studios|Record Plant Studio]].<ref name="BBC News">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/8/newsid_2536000/2536321.stm |title=BBC on this day Dec. 8 1980: John Lennon shot dead

===Meeting Chapman===
As they walked to their limousine, they were approached by several people seeking [[autograph]]s. Among them was a young man later to be identified as [[Mark David Chapman]]. Chapman silently handed Lennon a copy of ''Double Fantasy'', and Lennon obliged with an autograph. After signing the album Lennon asked him, "Is this all you want?" Chapman replied with, "Thank you, John", while photographer and Lennon fan Paul Goresh snapped photos of them both.<ref name="GoreshBiog">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1927353/bio |title=Goresh Biog |accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>
[[Image:Police artist image of murder of John Lennon.jpg|thumb|right|Police artist's image of the murder]]
The Lennons spent several hours at the Record Plant studio before returning to the Dakota at about 10:50 p.m. Lennon decided against eating out so he could be home in time to say goodnight to five-year-old son [[Sean Lennon|Sean]] before he went to sleep.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lennon shot on way to see son: Ono |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/223747}}</ref> They exited their limousine on 72nd Street, even though the car could have been driven into the more secure courtyard.

===The Shooting===
The Dakota's doorman, Jose Perdomo, and a cab driver saw Chapman standing in the shadows by the archway. Ono walked ahead of Lennon and into the reception area, and then Chapman called out, "Mr. Lennon!" As Lennon turned around, Chapman dropped into a "[[Modern Technique of the Pistol|combat stance]]" and shot at Lennon five times with [[hollow point bullet]]s from a [[Charter Arms]] [[.38]] [[revolver]].<ref name="PoliceTraceTangledPath">{{cite web |url=http://elvispelvis.com/johnlennon.htm#NYT  |title=Police Trace Tangled Path Leading To Lennon's Slaying at the Dakota |publisher=elvispelvis.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> One shot missed, passing over Lennon's head and hitting a window of the Dakota building. Two shots struck Lennon in the left side of his back and two more in his left shoulder. All four wounds caused serious internal damage, and at least one of them fatally pierced Lennon's [[aorta]].<ref name="TheStruggletoSaveJohn">{{cite web |url=http://johnlennon.tribe.net/thread/eff7a05b-e687-4bb4-be00-3a9ce8aa7396 |title=The Struggle to Save John |publisher=johnlennon.tribe.net|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> Lennon staggered up four steps to the security/reception area, said, "I'm shot," and collapsed. [[Concierge]] Jay Hastings first thought it was a joke, but then summoned police by hitting a silent alarm button.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/1239/ The Murder Of John Lennon<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Outside, doorman Perdomo shook the gun out of Chapman's hand then kicked it across the sidewalk. Chapman then removed his coat and hat in preparation for the police arrival to show he was not carrying any concealed weapons and sat down on the sidewalk. Doorman Perdomo shouted at Chapman, "Do you know what you've done?" Chapman calmly replied, "Yes, I just shot John Lennon." The first [[Police officer|policemen]] to arrive were Steve Spiro and Peter Cullen, who were at 72nd Street and [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] when they heard a report of shots fired at the Dakota. The officers found Chapman sitting "very calmly" on the sidewalk. They reported that Chapman had dropped the revolver to the ground, and was holding a paperback book ([[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'').<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E00E1D8133BF93AA35751C0A967948260 Lennon Murder Suspect Preparing Insanity Defense - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The second team, Officers Bill Gamble and James Moran, arrived a few minutes later.  They immediately carried Lennon into their squad car and rushed him to [[St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center|Roosevelt Hospital]]. Officer Moran said they stretched out Lennon (who was "moaning") on the back seat. Moran asked, "Do you know who you are?" Lennon nodded slightly and tried to speak, but could only manage to make a gurgling sound, and lost consciousness shortly thereafter.<ref name="Lennonshotonwaytoseeson">{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/223747 |title=Lennon shot on way to see son |publisher=thestar.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

===Death===
Lennon was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] in the Emergency Room at the Roosevelt Hospital at 11:07 p.m. by Dr. Stephan Lynn. The cause of death was reported as [[hypovolemic shock]], after losing more than 80% of [[blood volume]]. Dr. Elliott M. Gross (the Chief Medical Examiner) said that no one could have lived more than a few minutes with such multiple bullet injuries. Ono, crying "Oh no, no, no, no...tell me it's not true," was taken to Roosevelt Hospital and led away in shock after she learned that her husband was dead. On December 9, the following day, Ono issued a statement: "There is no funeral for John. John loved and prayed for the human race. Please pray the same for him. Love, Yoko and Sean."<ref name="RS951">{{cite news

==Breaking the news and Media Response==
Shortly after local news stations reported the shooting, crowds gathered at Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota - reciting [[Prayer|prayers]], singing Lennon's songs and burning candles. The first national transmission of the news across the U.S. was on the fledgling [[Cable News Network]] (CNN), on which anchorwoman Kathleen Sullivan reported that Lennon had been shot and was en route to a New York hospital (his death had not been confirmed). [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] was in the midst of airing an [[National Football League|NFL]] game between the [[Miami Dolphins]] and [[New England Patriots]]. After hearing the news sent by [[ABC News]] chief [[Roone Arledge]], sports announcer [[Howard Cosell]] (who had interviewed Lennon on [[Monday Night Football]] on [[9 December]] [[1974]]) announced the news of Lennon's murder. [[NBC]] announced the news during a comedy sketch on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. It was interrupted by an anonymous announcer voicing the news bulletin, and then returned to the [[Sketch comedy|sketch]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

===[[The Beatles|Beatles]]' Responses===
When reporters cornered Lennon's former Beatles-[[Lennon/McCartney|songwriting partner]] [[Paul McCartney]] for his reaction, McCartney said, "Drag, isn't it?" His response was criticised, but McCartney later stated in a ''Playboy'' interview: "I had just finished a whole day in shock and I said, 'It's a drag.' I meant drag in the heaviest sense of the word, you know: 'It's a <U+2014> DRAG.' But, you know, when you look at that in print, it says, 'Yes, it's a drag.' Matter of fact."<ref name="McCartneyPlayboyInterview1984">{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~taz4158/macint.htm |title=Paul McCartney 1984 Playboy Interview |publisher=members.tripod.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>  McCartney also added that ''"John will be remembered for his unique contribution to art, music and world peace."''

[[George Harrison]], after waking up to the terrible news, went into seclusion in England and tearfully issued a statement: "To rob someone of life is the ultimate robbery!"  He later released a tribute song, "[[All Those Years Ago]]" which featured background vocals from former bandmates [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. 

Starr and his wife, [[Barbara Bach]], flew to New York to comfort Ono.

==Memorials and Tributes==
A crowd gathered outside the Dakota the night of Lennon's death. Ono sent word that their singing kept her awake and asked that they re-convene in Central Park the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer ([http://www.johnlennon.it/english.htm see also the 1980 Central Park Vigil - Tribute to John Lennon]). On [[December 14]] [[1980]], millions of people around the world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group - over 100,000 - converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting.<ref>Clyde Haberman, "Silent Tribute to Lennon's Memory is Observed Throughout the World," ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[15 December]] [[1980]] pA1</ref>

Lennon continues to be mourned throughout the world and has been the subject of numerous [[memorial]]s and tributes, principally New York City's [[Strawberry Fields memorial|Strawberry Fields]], a memorial garden area in [[Central Park]] across the street from the Dakota building. Shortly after his death, Ono donated $1 million for its maintenance. It has become a gathering place for tributes on Lennon's birthday and on the anniversary of his death, as well as at other times of mourning, such as after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and following George Harrison's death on [[29 November]] [[2001]].

On [[9 October]] [[2007]], Ono dedicated a new memorial called the [[Imagine Peace Tower]], located on the island of [[Videy]] off the coast of Iceland. Each year, between [[9 October]] and [[8 December]], it will project a vertical beam of light high into the sky.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}
[[Image:John Lennon Memorial in Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A memorial statue of Lennon in Havana, Cuba.]]

Every [[8 December]] there is a memorial ceremony in front of the [[Capitol Records]] building on [[Vine Street]] in [[Hollywood, California]]. It includes speakers discussing Lennon and musical tributes.

Lennon was honoured with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1991. In 1994, the [[Republic of Abkhazia]] (an [[unrecognized state]] that is officially part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) issued two [[postage stamps]] featuring Lennon and [[Groucho Marx]], spoofing Abkhazia's [[communist state|Communist]] past.<ref name="Stamps">{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/marx-and-lennon-stamp-from-abkhazia-jpg#top  |title=Postage stamps |publisher=answers.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref> (The stamps would have normally borne the portraits of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].)

In 2000, the [[John Lennon Museum]] was opened in [[Saitama Super Arena]] in [[Saitama, Saitama]], Japan. Liverpool renamed its airport the [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] and adopted the motto "Above us only sky" in 2002. The 25th memorial of John Lennon's death was on [[8 December]] [[2005]]. Celebrations of Lennon's life and music took place in [[London]], New York City, [[Cleveland]], and [[Seattle]]. The minor planet 4147, discovered [[12 January]] [[1983]] by B. A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in memory of Lennon.<ref name="PlanetLennon">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/special/rocknroll/0004147.html  |title=Lennon's planet |publisher=cfa.harvard.edu|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>

From 28 September until [[30 September]] [[2007]], musicians, poets, painters, dramatists and others came together to celebrate the "John Lennon Northern Lights Festival" in the village of [[Durness]], [[Scotland]]. This cultural event, drawing artists and audiences from across the United Kingdom and around the world, was hosted in the region where Lennon spent Summer holidays as a boy. His cousin, Stanley Parkes, said: "The festival is not remembering John Lennon the pop star, but John the person, the writer and the poet."<ref name="NorthernLightsfestival">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.com/blog/john-lennon-northern-lights-festival-in-durness |title=John Lennon Northern Lights Festival in Durness |publisher=scotland.com|accessdate=2007-12-20}}</ref>
