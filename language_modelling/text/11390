'''Huntsville''' is a city located primarily in [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison County]] in the central part of the far northern region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]].  Huntsville is the [[county seat]] of Madison County.{{GR|6}} The city extends west into neighboring [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone County]]. Huntsville's population was 180,105 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. The [[Huntsville Metropolitan Area]]'s population was 417,593.<ref name="2010popBhamNews">{{cite web | url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2011/02/metro_huntsville_population_ex.html | title=Metro Huntsville population explodes in 2010 Census, making it state's second-largest metro area | accessdate=2011-02-26 | author=Pierce, Phil | date=2011-02-17 | work=Birmingham News, The | publisher=al.com}}</ref> Huntsville is the fourth-largest city in Alabama and the largest city in the four-county [[Huntsville-Decatur Combined Statistical Area]], which in 2008 had a total population of 545,770.

It grew across nearby hills and along the [[Tennessee River]],<!---this doesn't seem germane---> adding [[textile]] mills, then [[munitions]] factories, [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and the [[United States Army Aviation and Missile Command]] nearby at the [[Redstone Arsenal]]. The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] named Huntsville to its "America's Dozen Distinctive Destinations for 2010" list.<ref name="dist10">{{cite news |first=Deborah |last=Storey |work=The Huntsville Times |title=Huntsville on the list of 'Distinctive Destinations' for 2010 |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2010/02/post_199.html |date=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

==History==
===First settlers===

Revolutionary War veteran John Hunt first settled in the land around the [[Big Spring Park (Huntsville, Alabama)|Big Spring]] in 1805.  The area was subsequently purchased by [[LeRoy Pope]], who named the area [[Twickenham]] after the home village of his distant kinsman [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |title=Notes on the History of Huntsville |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>

Twickenham was carefully planned, with streets laid out on the northeast to southwest direction based on the Big Spring. However, due to anti-English sentiment during this period, the name was changed to "Huntsville" to honor John Hunt, who had been forced to move to other land south of the new city.<ref>Record, James, and John McCormick; "Huntsville, Alabama: Rocket City, U.S.A.", pamphlet published in 1953 by Strode Publishers</ref>

Both John Hunt and LeRoy Pope were [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and charter members of [[Helion Lodge|Helion Lodge #1]].<ref name=helion>{{cite web|author=Toby Norris |url=http://www.helionlodge.org/ |title=Helion Lodge #1, Huntsville, Alabama |publisher=Helionlodge.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>

===Incorporation 1811===
In 1811, Huntsville became the first incorporated town in Alabama. However, the recognized "birth" year of the city is 1805, the year of John Hunt's arrival. The city's [[sesquicentennial]] anniversary was held in 1955 and the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] was celebrated in 2005.

===Emerging industries===
Huntsville's quick growth was from wealth generated by the [[cotton]] and [[railroad]] industries. Many wealthy planters moved into the area from Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. In 1819, Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen's large cabinetmaking shop. The forty-four delegates meeting there wrote a constitution for the new state of [[Alabama]]. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama's first capital when the state was admitted to the [[United States of America|Union]]. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only, and the capital was then moved to another temporary location, [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahawba]], until the legislature selected [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] as the permanent location.

In 1855, the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the Atlantic seacoast with the lower Mississippi River.

===Civil War===
[[File:Huntsville AL USA 1871 Birds Eye View.jpg|thumb|Bird's Eye View of 1871 Huntsville, Alabama]]

Huntsville initially opposed secession from the Union in 1861, but provided many men for the Confederacy's efforts. The 4th Alabama Infantry Regiment, led by Col. Egbert J. Jones of Huntsville, distinguished itself at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas/Bull Run]], the first major encounter of the [[American Civil War]]. The Fourth Alabama Infantry, which contained two Huntsville companies, were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war and were present when Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] in April 1865. Eight generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville, evenly split with four on each side.

On the morning of April 11, 1862, Union troops led by General [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] seized Huntsville to sever the Confederacy's rail communications. The Union troops were forced to retreat some months later, but returned to Huntsville in the fall of 1863 and thereafter used the city as a base of operations for the remainder of the war. While many homes and villages in the surrounding countryside were burned in retaliation for the active guerrilla warfare in the area, Huntsville itself was spared because it housed elements of the Union Army.

===After the Civil War===
After the Civil War, Huntsville became a center for cotton textile mills, such as Lincoln, Dallas and Merrimack. Each mill had its own housing community that included everything the mill workers needed (schools, churches, grocery stores, theatres, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill).

[[Lily Flagg]] broke the world record for butter production in 1892, spawning an elaborate party wherein her Huntsville-resident owner General Samuel H. Moore painted his house butter yellow and arranged for electric lights for the dance floor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cookbookoftheday.blogspot.com/2010/04/huntsville-heritage-cookbook.html |title=Huntsville Heritage Cookbook |author=Lucinda |date=2010-04-17 |work=Cookbook of the Day |publisher=Blogspot |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref>  An area south of Huntsville was named Lily Flagg before 1906.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=xxUlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22lily+flagg%22#v=onepage&q=%22lily%20flagg%22&f=false |title=Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Volume 274 |author=United States Geological Society |year= 1906 |accessdate=15 August 2010}}</ref><ref name="sccc">{{cite web |url=http://www.springcity.org/history.stm |title=Early History of the Spring City Cycling Club |author=James Record |date= 2009-03-18 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> This area was later annexed into the city.

===Great Depression 1930s===
During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the [[Great Depression]]. Huntsville became known as the [[Watercress]] Capital of the World<ref name=MSFC>{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |title=NASA MSFC Notes on the History of Huntsville |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref> because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in [[cotton]] production during this time.<ref name=MSFC />

===World War II===
By 1940, Huntsville was still a small, quiet town with a population of about 13,000 inhabitants. This quickly changed in early 1941 when {{convert|35,000|acre|km2}} of land adjoining the southwest area of the city was selected by the U.S. Army for building three chemical munitions facilities: the Huntsville Arsenal, the Redstone Ordnance Plant (soon redesignated Redstone Arsenal), and the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. These operated throughout World War II, with combined personnel approaching 20,000.<ref>Baker, Michael; ''Redstone Arsenal: Yesterday and Today'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1993-758-626/80050</ref>

===Missile Development===
At the end of the war in 1945, the munitions facilities were no longer needed. They were combined with the designation Redstone Arsenal (RSA) and a considerable political and business effort was made in attempts to attract new tenants. One significant start involved manufacturing the [[Keller (automobile)|Keller automobile]], but this closed with only 18 vehicles built. With the encouragement of Senator [[John Sparkman]]. the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] considered it for a major testing facility, but then selected another site. Redstone Arsenal was then prepared for disposal, but, again with assistance from Senator Sparkman, it was selected for the Army<U+2019>s rocket and missile development.<ref name="Baker, Op.Cet.">Baker, ''Op.Cet.''</ref>

[[Image:Medaris vonBraun and Toftoy 01.jpg|thumb|right|210px|(l&ndash;r:) RSA commander Maj. Gen. John Medaris, Wernher von Braun, and RSA deputy commander Brig. Gen. [[Holger Toftoy]] in the 1950s]]

In 1950, about 1,000 personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss, Texas, to Redstone Arsenal to form the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC). Central to this was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]] that had originally been brought to America by Colonel [[Holger Toftoy]] under [[Operation Paperclip]]. As the [[Korean War]] started, the OGMC was given the mission to develop what eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]]. This rocket set the stage for America<U+2019>s space program, as well as major Army missile programs, to be centered in Huntsville. Toftoy, then a Brigadier General, commanded OGMC and the overall Redstone Arsenal. In early 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under Major General [[John Bruce Medaris|John Medaris]] was formed.<ref name="Baker, Op.Cet."/>

===Space Flight===
[[File:USSRC Rocket Park.JPG|thumb|left|Historic rockets in [[Rocket Park]] of the [[United States Space & Rocket Center|US Space and Rocket Center]], Huntsville, Alabama]]

The city is nicknamed "''The Rocket City''" for its close history with U.S. space missions. On January 31, 1958, ABMA placed America's first satellite, [[Explorer I]], into orbit using a Jupiter C launch vehicle, a descendant of the Redstone. This brought national attention to Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville, with widespread recognition of this being a major center for high technology.

On July 1, 1960, 4,670 civilian employees, associated buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1,840|acre|km2}} of land transferred from ABMA to form NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was MSFC's initial Director. On September 8, U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] formally dedicated the MSFC.<ref>[http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/marshall/formation-msfc.html Notes on Formation of the Marshall Center]</ref>

[[File:SpaceShuttleAtSpaceCamp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Pathfinder]] at [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]]]]

During the 1960s, the major mission of MSFC was in developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn boosters]] used by NASA in the [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar Landing Program]]. For this, MSFC greatly increased its employees, and many new companies joined the Huntsville industrial community. The [[Cummings Research Park]] was developed just north of Redstone Arsenal to partially accommodate this industrial growth, and has now became the second largest research park of this type in America.

Huntsville's economy was nearly crippled and growth almost came to a standstill in the 1970s following the closure of the Apollo program. However, the emergence of the [[Space Shuttle]], the [[International Space Station]], and a wide variety of advanced research in space sciences led to a resurgence in NASA-related activities that has continued into the 21st century. In addition, new Army organizations have emerged at Redstone Arsenal, particularly in the ever-expanding field of [[missile defense]].

Situated in the [[Tennessee River]] valley, several [[plateau]]s and large hills partially surround Huntsville. These plateaus are associated with the [[Cumberland Plateau]], and are locally called "mountains".  [[Monte Sano Mountain]] (Italian for "Healthy Mount") is the most notable, and is east of the city along with Round Top (Burritt), Chapman, Huntsville, and Green Mountains. Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin Mountains on [[Redstone Arsenal]] in the south. [[Brindlee Mountain]] is visible in the south across the Tennessee River.

As with other areas along the Cumberland Plateau, the land around Huntsville is [[karst]] in nature. The city was founded around the Big Spring, which is a typical karst spring, and many [[cave]]s perforate the limestone bedrock underneath the surface, as is common in karst areas. The headquarters of the [[National Speleological Society]] are located in Huntsville.

===Boundaries===

===Climate===
Huntsville has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|89.4|F|C|1|abbr=on}} in the summer to {{convert|48.9|F|C|1|abbr=on}} during winter.

Much of Huntsville's precipitation is delivered by [[thunderstorms]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} There are, on average, about 60 days per year during which thunder is reported.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer but the most severe storms occur during the spring and - sometimes - fall.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} These storms can deliver large [[hail]], damaging straight line winds and [[tornadoes]]. Huntsville lies in a region of the country which is colloquially known as [[Dixie Alley]], an area more prone to violent, long track tornadoes than most other parts of the US.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Doyle|title=Dixie Alley may see more tornado action than even Tornado Alley|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2011-04-25-tornado-dixie-alley.htm|accessdate=January 24, 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=April 25, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64wmEodru|archivedate=January 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Dixie Alley">{{Cite web| last = Gerard| first = Alan| coauthors = John Gagan, John Gordon| title = A Comparison of Tornado Statistics from Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley| publisher = National Weather Service| accessdate = January 24, 2012| date = October 17, 2005| url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/jan/tor_stats/DixieAlley_17Oct2005pm.ppt|format=PPT|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64wmNJ8u6|archivedate=January 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

On April 27, 2011, one of the largest tornado outbreaks in history, the [[April 25<U+2013>28, 2011 tornado outbreak]], affected the Northern Alabama Area. During this event, an [[EF5]] tornado that tracked near the [[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant]] destroyed many transmission towers and caused a multi-day power outage for the majority of [[North Alabama]]. Significant Damage from that same tornado was also taken in the Anderson Hills subdivision and in [[Harvest, Alabama]]. In total, nine people were killed in [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison County]] alone and many others injured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Challen Stephens, The Huntsville Times |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/04/friay_morning.html |title=Tornadoes now responsible for 9 deaths in Madison County, officials say|publisher=Blog.al.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}</ref>  Other significant tornado events include the [[Super Outbreak]] in 1974, the [[November 1989 Tornado Outbreak]] that killed 21 and injured almost 500, and the [[Anderson Hills Tornado]] that killed one and caused extensive damage in 1995.<ref name="tn740326">{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina){{!}}The Times-News]]''|location=Hendersonville, NC|page=19|title=42 Persons Dead in Severe Storms, Tornadoes in Alabama|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NfUZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QSQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6088,2888015&dq=national-weather-service+radio+huntsville&hl=en|date=March 25, 1974|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="td040403">{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Sherer|newspaper=''[[TimesDaily]]''|location=Florence, AL|page=B1 |title=Night of April 3, 1974, marked change in severe weather alerts, preparedness |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g_shAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1409,304037|date=April 3, 2004|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> On January 21, 2010, Huntsville experienced a rare mid-winter tornado.

Since Huntsville is nearly {{convert|300|mi|km}} inland, [[hurricane]]s are rarely experienced with their full force; however, many weakened tropical storms cross the area after a [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] landfall. While most winters have some measurable snow, significant snow is rare in Huntsville; but there have been some anomalies, like the 1963 New Year's Eve snowstorm, when {{convert|17|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} fell within 24 hours. Likewise, the [[Blizzard of 1993]] and a [[Groundhog Day]] snowstorm in 1996 were substantial winter events for Huntsville. On Christmas Day 2010 Huntville recorded over {{convert|4|in}} of snow in place, and on January 9<U+2013>10, 2011 Huntsville {{convert|8.9|in}} at the airport to over {{convert|10|in}} in the suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/01/snowfall_most_since_1988_in_hu.html|title = Snowfall most since 1988 in Huntsville, third-biggest on record|first = Steve|last = Doyle|date = 10|month = January|year = 2011|publisher = [[The Huntsville Times]]|accessdate = October 4, 2011}}</ref>

*'''District 3''' (Southeast): John Olshefski
*'''District 4''' (Southwest): Bill Kling
*'''District 5''' (West): Will Culver.

====Railroads====
Huntsville has two active commercial rail lines. The mainline is run by [[Norfolk Southern]], which runs from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].  The original depot for this rail line, the [[Huntsville Depot]] still exists as a [[railroad museum]], though it no longer offers passenger service.

Another rail line, formerly part of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N)]], successor to the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL)]], is being operated by the [[Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority|Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority (HMCRA)]].  The line connects to the Norfolk Southern line downtown and runs {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} south, passing near [[Ditto Landing]] on the [[Tennessee River]], and terminating at Norton Switch, near Hobbs Island.  This service, in continuous operation since 1894, presently hauls freight and provides [[transloading]] facilities at its downtown depot location. Until the mid-fifties, the L&N provided freight and passenger service to Guntersville and points South.  The rail cars were loaded onto barges at Hobbs Island.  The barge tows were taken upstream through the Guntersville Dam & Locks and discharged at Port Guntersville.  Remnants of the track supporting piers still remain in the river just upstream from Hobbs Island.  The service ran twice daily.  L&N abandoned the line in 1984 at which time it was acquired by the newly-created HMCRA, a state agency.

A third line, the Mercury and Chase Railroad, runs {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} weekend tourist rides on part of another former NC&StL and L&N line from the [[North Alabama Railroad Museum]]'s Chase Depot, located in the community of [[Chase, Alabama]].  The rail line originally connected Huntsville to NC&StL's Nashville-to-Chattanooga mainline in [[Decherd, Tennessee]].  The depot was once the smallest [[union station]] in the United States when it served the NC&StL and [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]], a the predecessor to the Norfolk Southern.<ref>{{cite web
