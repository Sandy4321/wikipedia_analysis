The field of [[mathematics]] has a vast [[vocabulary]] of specialist and technical terms. It also has a certain amount of [[jargon]]: commonly used phrases which are part of the culture of mathematics, rather than of the subject. Jargon  often appears in lectures, and sometimes in print, as informal shorthand for more rigorous arguments or more precise ideas. Much of this is common English, used in a mathematical or quasi-mathematical sense.

Note that some phrases, like "in general",  appear in more than one section. 

==Philosophy of mathematics==
These terms discuss mathematics as mathematicians think of it; they connote common intellectual strategies or notions the investigation of which somehow underlies much of mathematics.
; [[abstract nonsense]]: Also ''generalized abstract nonsense'', a tongue-in-cheek reference to the prevalence of [[category theory]] in mathematics, which leads to arguments that establish a result without reference to any specifics of the present problem.
; [[Canonical#Mathematics|canonical]]: A reference to a standard or choice-free presentation of some mathematical object. The term ''canonical'' is also used more informally, meaning roughly "standard" or "classic". For example, one might say that [[Euclid]]'s proof is the "canonical proof" of the infinitude of primes; indeed, this is a canonical example of a canonical proof.
; [[mathematical beauty|elegant]]: Also ''beautiful''; an aesthetic term referring to the ability of an idea to provide insight into mathematics, whether by unifying disparate fields, introducing a new perspective on a single field, or providing a technique of proof which is either particularly simple, or captures the intuition or imagination as to why the result it proves is true.  [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] distinguished between ''elegant'' and ''beautiful'', saying that for example, some topics could be written about elegantly although the mathematical content is not beautiful, and some theorems or proofs are beautiful but may be written about inelegantly.
; [[natural transformation|natural]]: Similar to "canonical" but more specific, this term makes reference to a description (almost exclusively in the context of [[transformation (mathematics)|transformation]]s) which holds independently of any choices.  Though long used informally, this term has found a formal definition in category theory.
; [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]]: An object behaves pathologically if it fails to conform to the generic behavior of such objects, fails to satisfy certain regularity properties (depending on context), or simply disobeys mathematical intuition.  These can be and often are contradictory requirements.  Sometimes the term is more pointed, referring to an object which is specifically and artificially exhibited as a counterexample to these properties.
; [[Rigour#Mathematical_rigour|rigor (rigour)]]: Mathematics strives to establish its results using indisputable logic rather than informal descriptive argument.  Rigor is the use of such logic in a proof.
; [[well-behaved]]: An object is well-behaved (in contrast with being ''pathological'') if it ''does'' satisfy the prevailing regularity properties, or sometimes if it conforms to intuition (but intuition often suggests the opposite behavior as well).

==Descriptive informalities==
Although ultimately, every mathematical argument must meet a high standard of precision, mathematicians use descriptive but informal statements to discuss recurring themes or concepts with unwieldy formal statements.  Note that many of the terms are completely rigorous in context.
; [[almost all]]: In contexts which admit a notion of generality or genericity of objects, a property holds for almost all objects if it holds generically.  For example, one might say "almost all integers are not zero."  This phrase is not informal in the context of [[real number]]s or other measure spaces, where it means "except for a set of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] zero".
; [[Arbitrarily large|arbitrarily large, arbitrarily small]], arbitrarily close: Notions which arise mostly in the context of limits, referring to phenomena which recur as the limit is approached.
; [[arbitrary]]: A shorthand for the universal existential quantifier.  An arbitrary choice is one which is made unrestrictedly, or alternatively, a statement holds of an arbitrary element of a set if it holds of any element of that set.
; factor through: A term in [[category theory]] referring to composition of functions.  If we have three objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and two maps, <math>f \colon A \to C</math> and <math>g \colon B \to C</math>, then we say that ''f'' ''factors through'' ''g'' if there exists some map <math>h \colon A \to B</math> such that <math>f = g \circ h</math>.  Likewise, if ''h'' rather than ''g'' is given first, we say that ''f'' factors through ''h''.
; for all sufficiently nice X: For all X which satisfy a set of conditions to be specified later. When [[heuristics|working out]] a theorem, the conditions involved may be not yet known to the speaker; the intent is to restrict the set of X to which the theorem applies when the proof runs into difficulties. 
; generic: This is similar to almost all, with usage mostly in non-measure theoretic contexts. For example, a property which holds on a [[Dense set|dense]] '''G'''<sub>&delta;</sub> (intersection of countably many open sets) is said to hold generically.  
; in general: In a descriptive context, this phrase introduces a simple characterization of a broad class of objects, with an eye towards identifying a unifying principle.  Concisely, this term introduces an "elegant" description which holds for "arbitrary" objects "modulo" "pathology".
; [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side, right-hand side]] (LHS, RHS): Most often, these refer simply to the left-hand or the right-hand side of an equation; for example, <math>x = y + 1</math> has ''x'' on the LHS and ''y +1'' on the RHS.  Occasionally, these are used in the sense of [[lvalue]] and [[rvalue]]: an RHS is primitive, and an LHS is derivative.
; resp.: (Respectively) A convention to shorten parallel expositions. "A (resp. B) [has some relationship to] X (resp. Y)" means that A [has some relationship to] X and also that B [has (the same) relationship to] Y. 
; sharp: Often, a mathematical theorem will establish constraints on the behavior of some object; for example, a function will be shown to have an upper or lower bound.  The constraint is ''sharp'' if it cannot be made more restrictive without failing in some cases.
; [[smooth function|smooth]]: ''Smoothness'' is a concept which mathematics has endowed with many meanings, from simple differentiability to infinite differentiability to analyticity, and still others which are more complicated.  Each such usage attempts to invoke the physically intuitive notion of smoothness.
; [[Sufficiently large|sufficiently large, suitably small]], sufficiently close: In the context of limits, these terms refer to phenomena which prevail as the limit is approached.
; [[transport of structure]]: It is often the case that two objects are shown to be equivalent in some way, and that one of them is endowed with additional structure.  Using the equivalence, we may define such a structure on the second object as well, via ''transport of structure''.  For example, any two [[vector space]]s of the same dimension are isomorphic; if one of them is given an [[inner product]] and if we fix a particular isomorphism, then we may define an inner product on the other space by ''factoring through'' the isomorphism.
; upstairs, downstairs: A descriptive term referring to notation in which two objects are written one above the other; the upper one is ''upstairs'' and the lower, ''downstairs''.  For example, in a [[fiber bundle]], the total space is often said to be ''upstairs'', with the base space ''downstairs''.  In a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[numerator]] is occasionally referred to as ''upstairs'' and the [[denominator]] ''downstairs'', as in "bringing a term upstairs".
; [[up to]], [[modulo]], mod out by: An extension to mathematical discourse of the notions of [[modular arithmetic]].  A statement is true ''up to'' a condition if the establishment of that condition is the only impediment to the truth of the statement.

==Proofs and rigorous proof techniques==
The formal language of [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] draws repeatedly from a small pool of ideas, many of which are invoked through various lexical shorthands in practice.
; [[aliter]]: An obsolescent term which refers to an alternative method of proof.
; [[diagram chasing]]: An argument to show that a diagram is commutative by tracking the value of an element through compositions in the diagram.
; [[Iff#More_general_usage|if and only if]] (iff): An abbreviation for logical equivalence of statements.
; in general: In the context of proofs, this phrase is often seen in [[mathematical induction|induction]] arguments when passing from the base case to the "induction step", and similarly, in the definition of [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]]s whose first few terms are exhibited as examples of the formula giving every term of the sequence.
; [[necessary and sufficient]]: A minor variant on "if and only if"; ''necessary'' means "only if" and ''sufficient'' means '"if".  For example, "For a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' to be [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] it is necessary and sufficient that it have no finite [[field extension]]s" means "''K'' is algebraically closed if and only if it has no finite extensions".  Often used in lists, as in "The following conditions are necessary and sufficient for a field to be algebraically closed...".
; [[one and only one]]: An especially precise existence statement; the object exists, and furthermore, no other such object exists.
; [[proof by contradiction|by way of contradiction]] (BWOC), or "for, if not, ..." : The rhetorical prelude to a proof by contradiction, preceding the negation of the statement to be proved.
; [[Q.E.D.]]: A Latin abbreviation historically placed at the end of proofs, but less common currently.
; required to prove (RTP): Proofs sometimes proceed by enumerating several conditions whose satisfaction will together imply the desired theorem; thus, it is ''required to prove'' just these statements.
; the following are equivalent (TFAE): A particular definition is not always the most convenient for certain applications; often one proves theorems stating equivalent rephrasings of the definition.
; wish to show, want to show (WTS); need to show (NTS): If a proof proceeds along several steps, the goal of each stage of the argument is prefaced with this expression.
; [[Without loss of generality|without (any) loss of generality]] (WLOG, WOLOG, WALOG), we may assume (WMA), it may be assumed that (WOLOGIMBAT): Sometimes a proposition can be more easily proved with additional assumptions on the objects it concerns.  If the proposition as stated follows from this modified one with a simple and minimal explanation (for example, if the remaining special cases are identical but for notation), then the modified assumptions are introduced with this phrase and the altered proposition is proved.

==Informal proof techniques==
Some terms are techniques for the avoidance of rigorous proof, though are not [[logical fallacies]].  They suggest the content of a correct proof without supplying it.
; [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]: An informal computation omitting much rigor without sacrificing correctness.  Often this computation is "proof of concept" and treats only an accessible special case.
; [[by inspection]]: A rhetorical shortcut made by authors who invite the reader to verify, at a glance, the correctness of a proposed expression or deduction.
; clearly, can be easily shown: A term which shortcuts around calculation the mathematician perceives to be tedious or routine, accessible to any member of the audience with the necessary expertise in the field; [[Laplace]] used ''obvious''. 
; [[handwaving]]: A non-technique of proof mostly employed in lectures, where formal argument is not strictly necessary.  It proceeds by omission of details or even significant ingredients, and is merely a plausibility argument.
; in general: In a context not requiring rigor, this phrase often appears as a labor-saving device when the technical details of a complete argument would outweigh the conceptual benefits.  The author gives a proof in a simple enough case that the computations are reasonable, and then indicates that "in general" the proof is similar.
; morally true: Used to indicate that the speaker believes a statement ''should'' be true, given their mathematical experience, even though a proof has not yet been put forward.  As a variation, the statement may in fact be false, but instead provide a slogan for or illustration of a correct principle.  [[Helmut Hasse|Hasse]]'s [[local-global principle]] is a particularly influential example of this.
; [[Trivial (mathematics)|trivial]]: Similar to ''clearly''.  A concept is trivial if it holds by definition, is immediately corollary to a known statement, or is a simple special case of a more general concept.
