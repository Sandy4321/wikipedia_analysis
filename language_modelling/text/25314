'''Predrag "Miki" Manojlovi<U+0107>''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: <U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0440><U+0430><U+0433> "<U+041C><U+0438><U+043A><U+0438>" <U+041C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0458><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+045B>, born April 5, 1950, [[Belgrade, Serbia|Belgrade]]) is a [[Serbia]]n [[actor]], famous for his starring roles in some of the most important films of former Yugoslav cinema. Since the early 1990s, he successfully branched out into movies made outside the Balkans, meaning that he's currently active in productions all over [[Europe]]. At February [[2009]] the [[Government of Serbia|Serbian Government]] established him as a president of the Serbian Film Center. <ref>[http://myfilmo.com/miki-manojlovic-za-predsednika/ News on Film magazine] {{sr icon}}</ref>

== Biography ==
He grew up in a family of stage actors - father Ivan Manojlovi<U+0107> and mother Zorka Dokni<U+0107>. After his screen debut in 1970, young Predrag continued to appear in numerous films and [[TV drama]]s made in SFR Yugoslavia, some of which, like the 1975 TV series ''[[Grlom u jagode]]'' where he memorably played Miki Rubiroza, achieved cult status. 

He is arguably best known for the role of the father in [[Emir Kusturica]]'s 1985 film ''[[When Father Was Away on Business]]'' and as a tragic [[opportunist]] in 1995's ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'' (also by Kusturica). He is known for his versatility which helped him make a strong impression both in starring and character roles, as well as dramas and comedies, with his small role in the 1992 hit comedy ''[[Mi nismo an<U+0111>eli]]'' being an example of the latter.  He played the role of [[Agostino Tassi]] in the 1997 film ''[[Artemisia (film)|Artemisia]]'' and that of Miki in ''[[Irina Palm]]''.

During the [[NATO]] bombardments in 1999, Miki said: ''"Westerners must understand that no one can constraint anybody, that the [[Balkans]] need to live their own life with their own multiplicity of cultures, religions, languages. They must understand that they should not worsen the situation with their own frustrations and their ideas which do not function, that the more bombs will fall in [[Yugoslavia]], the less safety will there be in [[Europe]]."''
