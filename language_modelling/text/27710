'''''United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe''''', [[Case citation|537 U.S. 465]] (2003), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in a 5<U+2013>4 decision that when the federal government used land or property held in trust for an Indian tribe, it had the duty to maintain that land or property and was liable for any damages for a breach of that duty. In the 1870s, the [[White Mountain Apache Tribe]] was placed on a reservation in [[Arizona]].  The case involved Fort Apache, a collection of buildings on the reservation which were transferred to the tribe by the [[United States Congress]] in 1960.

Although the tribe owned the Fort Apache buildings, they were held in trust and used exclusively by the federal government for an Indian school.  This was a continuation of the building's use from when the federal government retained title.  As more schools were built at other Indian reservations, attendance dropped at the Fort Apache school.  The tribe began to plan for use of the buildings and sought designation as a historic site.  When the federal government wanted to turn the property over to the tribe for use, the tribe found that the property had deteriorated and sued for damages to the property.  The trial court denied the tribe's claim, but the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the federal government had a duty to take care of the property.  The government then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the tribe could not make a claim without Congressional authorization.  The tribe argued that the 1960 act created the trust and authorized damages.  

The Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court, holding that the federal government used the property it held in trust, and that it therefore had a duty to maintain the property.  Justice Ginsburg issued a concurring opinion, while Justice Thomas dissented.  The loss led the government to settle with the tribe for $12 million.  The buildings are managed by the Fort Apache Heritage Foundation and the case, along with several others define the Indian Trust Doctrine.  The case has been widely discussed in legal literature and books, primarily in the area of Indian trusts.

In 1960, Congress provided that Fort Apache was to be held in trust for the White Mountain Apache Tribe, but allowed the DOI to use the property for "administrative or school purposes."<ref>Act of Mar. 18, 1960, {{USStat|74|8}} (1960); ''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 469; Holt at 428; Welch at 54, 59<U+2013>60; Brett J.

===Federal Claims Court===
In 1999, the tribe filed suit in the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]], seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe v. United States'', 46 Fed. Cl. 20 (1999) ''rev'd'' 249 F.3d 1364 (Fed.

Cl. at 29; Holt at 429; Welch at 61<U+2013>62.</ref>

===Federal Circuit Court of Appeals===
The tribe then appealed the case to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]].<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe v. United States'', 249 F.3d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2001), ''aff'd'' 537 U.S. 465 (2003); Holt at 430; Welch at 62.</ref> The appellate court found that various federal laws required the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages.<ref name="White Mountain Apache Tribe 1373">''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 249 F.3d at 1373.</ref> The court then looked to the 1960 act<ref name="USStat|74|8">{{USStat|74|8}}.</ref> and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages.<ref>{{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 286.</ref> This was based on [[common law]], with the court referencing the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement (Second) of Trusts]] to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings).<ref name="White Mountain Apache Tribe 1373"/> The court noted that both parties agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 249 F.3d at 1377.</ref> The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 249 F.3d at 1383; Welch at 62.</ref> The United States appealed, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] granted [[certiorari]].<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 471; Holt at 430<U+2013>31.</ref>

==Supreme Court==
===Arguments===
[[Gregory G. Garre]], [[United States Solicitor General|Assistant Solicitor General]] argued the case for the United States. As the petitioner, Garre argued that the 1960 act<ref name="USStat|74|8"/> did not authorize monetary damages for a breach of trust duties.<ref>Br. of United States 11; Welch at 63.</ref> Their position was that while a trust was formed, the tribe could not make a claim for damages without explicit congressional authorization.<ref>Welch at 63.</ref> Further, he argued, the exclusive control does not create liability; only the explicit language of statutes and regulations could allow monetary damages.<ref>Br. of United States 12; Welch at 63.</ref> The position of the United States was that "in trust"<ref name="USStat|74|8"/> meant was that the land was not subject to alienation or to state taxation.<ref>''[http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2002/2002_01_1067 United States v. White Mt. Apache Tribe]'', {{smallcaps|The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law}} (last visited July 30, 2013).</ref>

Robert C. Brauchli, an attorney from Arizona, argued the case for the White Mountain Apache Tribe. As respondent, Brauchli argued that the 1960 act,<ref name="USStat|74|8"/> by using the term "trust", did create liability for monetary damages.<ref>Br. of White Mountain Apache Tribe 10; Welch at 63.</ref> Since a trust was formed by law, the Indian Tucker Act allowed a lawsuit for damages to go forward.<ref>Br. of White Mountain Apache Tribe 14<U+2013>15; Welch at 62<U+2013>63.</ref> The tribe noted that the trust relationship was "one of the primary cornerstones of Indian law".<ref>Br. of White Mountain Apache Tribe 17 (citing {{smallcaps|Felix S. Cohen}}, {{smallcaps|Handbook of Federal Indian Law}} 221 (1982 ed.).</ref> The [[National Congress of American Indians]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief supporting the tribe.<ref>Welch at 64<U+2013>65.</ref>

===Opinion of the Court===
[[File:DavidSouter.jpg|thumb|right|px=275|alt=Justice David Souter|Justice Souter, the author of the majority opinion]]
Justice [[David Souter]] delivered the opinion of the court. Souter noted that any suit against the United States required a clear waiver of [[sovereign immunity]] and held that a waiver was granted by the Indian Tucker Act if there were statutory grounds in another federal statute or regulation.<ref>{{usc|28|1505}}; ''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 473; {{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 258.</ref> Souter then noted the difference between a "limited" or bare trust obligation, as was outlined in ''[[United States v. Mitchell (1980)|United States v. Mitchell I]]''<ref name=Mitch1>''United States v. Mitchell'', {{ussc|445|535|1980}} (''Mitchell I'').</ref> (''Mitchell I''), and those which could impose fiduciary duties and carry monetary damages, as outlined in ''[[United States v. Mitchell (1983)|United States v. Mitchell II]]''<ref name=Mitch2>''United States v. Mitchell'', {{ussc|463|206|1983}} (''Mitchell II'').</ref> (''Mitchell II'').<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 473<U+2013>74.</ref> In ''Mitchell I'', the United States held the land in trust to prevent alienation and to exempt the land from state taxation, but the tribe occupied and controlled the property.  In such cases, the government did not have a fiduciary duty.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 473.</ref> In ''Mitchell II'', the United States also held the land in trust, but actively controlled the property through comprehensive timber management regulations.  Here, the government did have a fiduciary duty to the tribe.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 474; Holt at 431; Stavin at 1761; {{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 292.</ref>

Souter stated that the 1960 act set up a trust in the same manner as ''Mitchell I'' and then went beyond that to allow the United States to use the land and buildings for a school and administrative purposes. This control was at least as great as that exercised over the timber in ''Mitchell II''.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 475; Holt at 431.</ref> Since the government had exclusive use and control of the property, it could "not allow it to fall into ruin on his watch."<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 475; Stavin at 1761; {{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 286.</ref>

The three defenses presented by the United States were deemed without merit. First, the concept that the 1960 act "carved out" the buildings used by the government goes against the plain language of the statute.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 476.</ref> Second, the fact that the statute does not explicitly state that the government is subject to monetary damages is also without merit. Souter noted that, were the court to accept that reasoning, it would require that the court to overturn ''Mitchell II'', which it was not prepared to do.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 477.</ref> Instead, the court will continue to use a "fair inference" from the law to determine if damages are authorized.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 478.</ref> Finally, the United States argued that the only appropriate relief would be [[Injunction|injunctive]] relief instead of damages. Souter stated that this was clearly wrong and merely postponed the cost to the government to repair the buildings.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 478; Stavin at 1761.</ref>

The court affirmed the decision of the Circuit Court and remanded it to the Court of Federal Claims for actions consistent with the ruling.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 479; Holt at 431; {{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 286.</ref>  Souter was joined in the majority opinion by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer.

===Concurrence===
Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] concurred in the opinion of the majority. Ginsburg expanded on the differences between the lack of liability under ''Mitchell I'' and the imposition of damages to compensate "for the harm caused by maladministration of the property."<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 481 (Ginsburg, concurring); Holt at 431.</ref>  She stated that the opinion of the court was consent with other cases, such as ''Mitchell II'' and ''[[United States v. Navajo Nation]]'',<ref>''United States v. Navajo Nation'', {{ussc|537|488|2003}}.</ref> where the government has exercised control in a "manner irreconcilable with its caretaker obligations".<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 480 (Ginsburg, concurring); Holt at 431.</ref> Ginsburg stated that the government had clearly failed its caretaker duties.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 481 (Ginsburg, concurring).</ref>  Ginsburg was joined by Justice Breyer in the concurrence.

===Dissent===
[[File:Clarence Thomas official SCOTUS portrait.jpg|thumb|alt=Justice Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas, the author of the dissenting opinion]]
Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] dissented, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Kennedy. Thomas stated that the test has always been if the statute in question could be "fairly ''interpreted''" to allow monetary damages.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 482 (Thomas, dissenting) (original emphasis).</ref> He stated that the majority had devised a new test: whether liability could be allowed on a "fair inference" of congressional authorization.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 482 (Thomas, dissenting).</ref> Thomas believed that ''Mitchell I'' was the proper case to compare with this one, as none of the detailed control and responsibilities present in ''Mitchell II'' were present in this case.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 483<U+2013>84 (Thomas, dissenting); Holt at 432.</ref> He further said that without a clear and unambiguous intent by Congress to make the United States liable, there could be no finding of monetary damages.<ref>''White Mountain Apache Tribe'', 537 U.S. at 487 (Thomas, dissenting).</ref>

==Subsequent developments==
The loss in court prompted the federal government to settle with the tribe for approximately $12 million in 2005.<ref>Welch at 66; Karl A. Hoerig, ''The Apaches finally win one; Tribe takes control of Fort Apache - after almost 137 years of federal governance'', {{smallcaps|Tucson Citizen}}, Mar. 19, 2007, at 11A.</ref> In 2007, the government transferred 27 buildings to the tribe along with the $12 million, plus interest.<ref>Welch at 67.</ref> They are managed by the Fort Apache Heritage Foundation, a nonprofit corporation chartered by the tribe.<ref>Hoerig at 11A</ref>  The case, together with ''Mitchell I'', ''Mitchell II'', and the ''Navajo Nation'', define the state of the Indian Trust Doctrine.<ref name="Welch at 69">Welch at 69.</ref> The United States has subsequently taken various actions to reduce the government's exposure to trust claims by tribes.<ref name="Welch at 69"/>

===Law reviews and books===
The case has been cited in numerous [[law reviews]]. Some of these were critical of the majority approach, stating that it went beyond the plain meaning of the text to open up the federal government to liability where none existed.<ref>Holt at 436<U+2013>39.</ref> Other reviews merely analyzed the decision and how it affected government-tribe trust cases.<ref>Stavin at 1761.</ref> Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.<ref>Alex Tallchief Skibine, ''Teaching Indian Law in an Anti-Tribal Era'', 82 {{smallcaps|N.D. L. Rev.}} 777, 783 (2006).</ref>

As with law reviews, the case has been cited in numerous books, especially those dealing with federal litigation or Indian law.<ref>{{smallcaps|Sisk}} at 286; Martin Reinhardt, ''Trust Doctrine'', {{smallcaps|Treaties with American Indians: An Encyclopedia of Rights, Conflicts, and Sovereignty}} 955 (Donald Fixico, ed. 2007).</ref> It has been cited extensively in regards to the trust relationship between BIA and the tribes,<ref>2 {{smallcaps|Indians in Contemporary Society}} 88 (Garrick A.
