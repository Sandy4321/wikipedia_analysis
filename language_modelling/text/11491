He is a past president of the [[American Football Coaches Association]].

Nehlen was a [[quarterback]] at [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] and led the team to a [[Mid-American Conference]] championship. He then began his coaching career in [[1958]] at Mansfield High School. Nehlen served as head coach at Canton South and Canton McKinley high schools and then was an assistant coach at [[University of Cincinnati]], Bowling Green, and [[University of Michigan]].

Since retirement, he has been a spokesman for the [[coal]] industry.  He has been urged to run as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] for several political offices, but as of [[2007]] he has declined to do so.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} He is a supporter of the FBI's childhood fingerprint identification campaign.

After being inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], Nehlen published a book called "[[Don Nehlen's Tales from the West Virginia Sideline]]". The [[autobiographical]] book recalled Nehlen's greatest moments, players, and more from his 21-years as the head coach at West Virginia.

==At West Virginia==

Nehlen had been quarterback's coach for [[Bo Schembechler]], [[University of Michigan]]'s coach, before taking the job at West Virginia. Nehlen became West Virginia's 29th football coach [[December 7]], [[1979]]. Nehlen replaced [[Frank Cignetti]] after four losing seasons. 

Nehlen assembled what he called a "perfect staff".{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Nehlen first hired [[Gary Tranquill]] as the offensive coach. Trying to resemble the Michigan defense, Nehlen hired Dennis Brown. Nehlen also hired some of the coaches he worked with at Bowling Green. Also, Nehlen hired [[Donnie Young]], Cignetti's former assistant head coach, as the recruiting coach for the last three months of recruiting. During Nehlen's tenure at West Virginia, he only had to let two coaches go that he had hired. Gary Tranquill left after three years to take the head coaching position at the [[United States Naval Academy]], taking a grad assistant [[Steve Dunlap]] with him. Dunlap would return and became West Virginia's defensive coach. One of Nehlen's most famed coaches was [[Doc Holliday (American football)|Doc Holliday]], who was the assistant head coach and recruiting coach for almost 20 years before leaving to be assistant coach at [[North Carolina State]]. Holliday was sent to [[Florida]] every year to find recruits. Holliday found many talented recruits in the Florida area, including linebacker [[Steve Grant]].

When Nehlen arrived at West Virginia University, he introduced their first "home and away uniforms" and WVU's helmet logo, which turned out to be West Virginia athletics new official logo, "The Flying WV.". Nehlen's first season, [[1980]], went 6-6. In [[1981]], led by quarterback [[Oliver Luck]], West Virginia went 8-3 and upset the [[Florida Gators]] in the [[Peach Bowl]] 26-6. In [[1982]], led by [[Jeff Hostetler]], West Virginia started the season with an upset over #9 [[Oklahoma Sooners]] and a win in [[1983]] against the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. The [[1984]] season had wins against [[Doug Flutie]]'s [[Boston College]] and [[Penn State]]. The Penn State win marked West Virginia's first win against them since [1955].

The [[1987]] season marked the beginning of the [[Major Harris]] era in West Virginia. In Harris' sophomore season, [[1988]], West Virginia went undefeated and played [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] in The National Championship [[Fiesta Bowl]]. West Virginia lost the game 34-21, after Major Harris' injury on the third play of the game. 

In [[1993]], Nehlen led West Virginia to another undefeated regular season, but Florida exacted revenge in the [[Sugar Bowl]], winning 41-7. The [[1994]] team started with a 1-4 record, but Nehlen managed to take West Virginia to the [[Carquest Bowl]], but lost to the [[University of South Carolina]] 24-21. 

In [[1998]], Nehlen had future [[NFL]] players [[Marc Bulger]], [[Amos Zereoue]], [[Anthony Becht]], [[Gary Stills]], [[Barrett Green]], [[Solomon Page]] and [[John Thornton (football player)|John Thornton]] to make up what he called "his best West Virginia...squad".{{Fact|date=March 2007}} West Virginia opened the season with a loss to [[Ohio State]], but finished the season with an 8-4 record, losing in the [[Insight Bowl]] to [[University of Missouri]] 34-31. 

Following a loss to [[Syracuse University]], Nehlen announced that the [[2000]] season would be his final. Nehlen's final home game was against [[ECU]]. Nehlen's final game was against [[Ole Miss]] in the [[Music City Bowl]]. After winning three of his first four bowls, Nehlen's bowl resume had been below average. But West Virginia handled the Rebels 49-38, let by the offensive attack of quarterback [[Brad Lewis (football player)|Brad Lewis]], tailback [[Avon Cobourne]], wide receiver [[Antonio Brown]], and fullback [[Wes Ours]].

Nehlen is West Virginia's all time leading coach in terms of victories. His career record there is 149-93-4. He coached 15 first team [[All-America]]ns, 82 all-conference players, and 80 NFL players. He received ''Coach of the Year'' honors from [[Kodak]]. In 1993, he won the ''Big East Coach of the Year'' award. In 1988, he led earned [[AFCA]] Coach of the Year honors.
