==Usage in sports==
On September 16, 2013, the song was unexpectedly used during player introductions by the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in their home opener against the [[Bengals<U+2013>Steelers rivalry|rival]] [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on [[Monday Night Football]], to tie in the song's [[jungle]] theme with the [[Bengal tiger|team's nickname]]. Throughout the game, the song was also played sporadically during game breaks. Although the Bengals won the game 20-10, the song drew much criticism by Bengals fans and even some of the team's players. One Bengals fan even told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[Steeler Nation|Steeler fans]] sitting near him were laughing at the Bengals fans throughout the game; the Steelers themselves have used the [[Styx (band)|Styx]] song "[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]" frequently at [[Heinz Field]] since 2001.<ref name=steelers>{{Cite news | title = Steelers Turn To Power Of 'Renegade' To Fuel Defense: 'Oh Momma' Rallying Cry For Black And Gold| newspaper = [[WTAE-TV]]| publisher = www.thepittsburghchannel.com| date = November 9, 2009 | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/sports/21562637/detail.html|archivedate=November 22, 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lUNrH0FM}}</ref> Four days after the game, the team publicly apologized, announcing that while the song would not be nixed from [[Paul Brown Stadium]]'s playlist completely, the team would use a [[hard rock]] or [[classic rock]] song for player introductions moving forward.<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|title=Katy Perry song nixed for intros|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9701089/cincinnati-bengals-tone-katy-perry-roar-fan-backlash Katy Perry song nixed for intros|publisher=ESPN|date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Synopsis===
The video begins with a scene showing Perry and her boyfriend having crashed their plane in the jungle. Perry shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, Perry and her boyfriend are still wandering through the jungle as her boyfriend throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Perry dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she puts her hand in the water. She sits on a rock and ends up covered in tarantulas and [[Tachypnea|breathing rapidly]]. As Perry looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around Perry before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.

[[File:Katy Perry-Roar video.jpg|thumb|Perry in the music video for "Roar" dressed as "Queen of the Jungle".]] 
Presumably a few days later, Perry has since made friends with a monkey and uses her [[stiletto heel]] to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, Perry is bathing in the lake, with the help of an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Perry helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them. When she leaves the cave, it is light outside and Perry is wearing a leopard-print bra and [[grass skirt]], displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a [[vine]].

With the help of the monkey, Perry builds a cat toy which she uses to distract the tiger who ate her boyfriend earlier in the video. She lures it into an area of the jungle, and traps it inside. She comes face-to-face with the tiger and the two of them roar at each other, until Perry's roar [[Tame animal|tames]] the tiger as it sits in front of her submissively. Afterwards, Perry is shown sitting on a giant grass throne, wearing a flower crown as the rest of the jungle animals sit around her, including the tiger, monkey and elephant. The tiger is shown wearing a collar that says "Kitty Purry", a reference to Perry's real-life cat of the same name. Perry takes [[selfie]]s with the monkey on her boyfriend's phone, and applies lipstick made from berries she has picked. She also paints the elephant's toenails pink. Perry awakens from sleeping in the plane, leading the viewer to think all the previous events have just been a dream, but walks out of the plane still in the jungle, stretching her arms and yawning with the animals sitting around her.

===Reception===
Upon its release, the music video received mixed reviews from critics. [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] contributors Robbie Daw, Sam Lansky, and Carl Willott gave it mostly lackluster reviews. Daw considered that the release of such a "safe" video was a disappointment for Perry and expressed eagerness to her next single; while Lansky likened its "edg[iness]" to that of a "woman's antiperspirant commercial"; and the latter divided the video in what he considered to be of "good cheesy" and "bad cheesy": he highlighted the fake set, Perry's acting and the ending, but criticized the CGI, which he deemed "dopey", the product placement and Perry's "overly literal roar-off with a tiger". The only writer for the website that gave the visual a favorable review was Mike Wass, who appreciated the "campy element[s]" in it, while noting that it drew inspiration from the [[Doctor Jones#Music video|music video for "Doctor Jones"]] by the dance-pop group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]]. In total, the reviews had an average score of approximately 6 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|author=Wass, Mike|title=Pop Perspective: Katy Perry's "Roar" Video Reviewed By All Four Idolator Editors|url=http://www.idolator.com/7482925/pop-perspective-katy-perry-roar-video|work=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]|publisher=Spin Media|accessdate=December 25, 2013|date=September 6, 2013}}</ref>
