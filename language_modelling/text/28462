'''Hertfordshire puddingstone''' is a [[Puddingstone (rock)|puddingstone]], a type of [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] [[sedimentary rock]], which is largely confined to the [[England|English]] [[traditional county]] of [[Hertfordshire]]. Superficially, it resembles [[concrete]], but it is entirely natural, comprised of rounded [[flint]] pebbles bound with a younger [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]] of [[silica]] [[quartz]]. Its name derives from a resemblance to [[Christmas pudding]].

The flints were eroded from the surrounding [[chalk]] beds some 56 million years ago in the [[Eocene]] epoch and were transported by water action to beaches, where they were rounded by wave [[erosion]] and graded by size. A lowering of [[sea level]]s and general drying during a brief [[arid]] period drew out silica from surrounding rocks into the water immersing the flint pebbles. Further drying [[Precipitation (geology)|precipitated]] the silica which hardened around the pebbles, trapping them in the matrix. Puddingstone is commonly found in river beds, and is less frequently exposed to the surface.

[[Iron oxide|Oxides of iron]] were also trapped in the silica matrix, giving rise to many different hues when the puddingstone is examined closely. From a greater distance, puddingstone is generally brown or ginger in colour, although pink is possible.

The silica is very hard, which led to use being made of puddingstone as an auxiliary building material supplementing flintstone buildings such as St Mary's Church, [[Stocking Pelham]]; as a decorative feature or waymark in [[:Category:Villages in Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire villages]], such as at [[Watton-at-Stone]]; or, during [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, for grinding corn. 

Hertfordshire puddingstone was credited in local [[folklore]] with several [[supernatural]] powers, including being a protective [[charm]] against [[witchcraft]]. Parish records from the village of [[Aldenham]] relate that in 1662 a woman suspected of having been a witch was buried with a piece of it laid on top of her coffin to prevent her from escaping after burial.
