'''Dunstan''' (909 <U+2013> 19 May 988)<ref name=ODNB>Lapidge, "Dunstan [St Dunstan] (''d''. 988)"</ref> was an [[Abbot of Glastonbury|Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey]], a [[Bishop of Worcester]], a [[Bishop of London]], and an [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], later [[canonization|canonised]] as a [[saint]].<ref name="osv">{{Cite book|last=Bunson |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen |title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints |year=1998 |publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing |location=Huntington, IN |isbn=0-87973-588-0}}</ref> His work restored monastic life in England and reformed the English Church. His 11th-century biographer, [[Osbern of Canterbury|Osbern]], himself an artist and scribe, states that Dunstan was skilled in "making a picture and forming letters", as were other clergy of his age who reached senior rank.<ref name="ja">{{Cite book|last=Alexander |first=Jonathon |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work |year=1992 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |pages=9|isbn=0-30005-689-3 }}</ref>

Dunstan served as an important minister of state to several English kings. He was the most popular saint in England for nearly two centuries, having gained fame for the many stories of his greatness, not least among which were those concerning his famed cunning in defeating the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]].<ref name="ce">{{ws|"[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/St. Dunstan|St. Dunstan]]" in the 1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia''}}</ref>

==Early life (909<U+2013>43)==
===Birth===
Dunstan was born in [[Baltonsborough]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dunning |first=Robert |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=A History of Somerset |year=1983 |publisher=Phillimore & Co |location=Chichester |isbn=0-85033-461-6 }}</ref> He was the son of Heorstan, a noble of [[Wessex]]. Heorstan was the brother of the bishops of [[Bishop of Bath and Wells|Wells]] and of [[bishop of Winchester|Winchester]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green |first=John Richard  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=History of the English People, Volume I (of 8) Early England, 449<U+2013>1071; Foreign Kings, 1071<U+2013>1204; The Charter, 1204<U+2013>1216 |year= 1895|publisher=MacMillan |location=London |isbn=1434606937}}</ref> It is recorded that his mother, Cynethryth, was a pious woman. [[Osbern]] relates that a messenger miraculously told her of the saintly child she would give birth to:

{{quote|She was in the church of St Mary on Candleday, when all the lights were suddenly extinguished. Then the candle held by Cynethryth was as suddenly relighted, and all present lit their candles at this miraculous flame, thus foreshadowing that the boy "would be the minister of eternal light" to the Church of England.<ref name="ce"/>}}

The anonymous author of the earliest [[hagiography|Life]] places Dunstan's birth during the reign of [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]], while Osbern fixed it at "the first year of the reign of King <U+00C6>thelstan", 924 or 925. This date, however, cannot be reconciled with other known dates of Dunstan's life and creates many obvious [[anachronism]]s. Historians therefore assume that Dunstan was born c.&nbsp;910 or earlier.<ref name="Lapidge">Lapidge, Michael, "Dunstan" in Lapidge et al. (eds), ''The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''. Blackwell, Oxford, 1999. ISBN 0-631-15565-1</ref>

===School to the king's court===
As a young boy, Dunstan studied under the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monks]] who then occupied the ruins of [[Glastonbury Abbey]].<ref name="co">{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =St Dunstan  | work =Catholic Online  | publisher =Catholic Online   | date =  | url = http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=438  | format =  | doi =  | accessdate = July 2007 }}</ref> Accounts tell of his youthful optimism and of his vision of the abbey being restored.  While still a boy, Dunstan was stricken with a near-fatal illness and effected a seemingly miraculous recovery. Even as a child, he was noted for his devotion to learning and for his mastery of many kinds of artistic craftsmanship. With his parent's consent he was [[tonsure]]d, received [[minor orders]] and served in the ancient church of St Mary. He became so well known for his devotion to learning that he is said to have been summoned by his uncle [[Athelm]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], to enter his service.<ref name="ce"/> He was later appointed to the court of King [[Athelstan]].<ref name="ODCC">The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church by F.

[[Image:Dunstan2.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Dunstan playing his harp as the Devil is paying a visit]]

Dunstan soon became a [[favourite]] of the king and was the envy of other members of the court.<ref name="ce"/> A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with [[witchcraft]] and [[black magic]].<ref name = "osv"/> The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a [[cesspit|cesspool]].<ref name="cw">{{Cite web

The bishop tried to persuade him to become a [[monk]], but Dunstan was doubtful whether he had a vocation to a [[Clerical celibacy|celibate]] life. The answer came in the form of an attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan's body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be [[leprosy]].<ref name="ce"/> It was more probably some form of [[bacteremia|blood poisoning]] caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool.<ref name="cw"/> Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan's mind. He took [[Holy Orders]] in 943, in the presence of [[Alphege the Bald|<U+00C6>lfheah]], and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury.<ref name="ce"/> Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell five feet long and two and a half feet deep.  It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his handicrafts, and played on his harp.<ref name="ce"/> It is at this time, according to a late 11th-century legend, that the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] is said to have tempted Dunstan and to have been held by the face with Dunstan's tongs.<ref name="cw"/>

==Monk, abbot, and bishop (943<U+2013>60)==
===Life as a monk===
[[Image:Dunstan3.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Possible self-portrait of Dunstan. Detail from the ''Glastonbury Classbook''.]]
Dunstan worked as a [[silversmith]] and in the [[scriptorium]] while he was living at Glastonbury. It is thought likely that he was the artist who drew the well-known image of Christ with a small kneeling monk beside him in the ''Glastonbury Classbook'', "one of the first of a series of outline drawings which were to become a special feature of Anglo-Saxon art of this period."<ref name="ja">p.9</ref> Dunstan became famous as a musician, illuminator, and metalworker.<ref name = "ODCC"/>  Lady  <U+00C6>thelflaed, King  <U+00C6>thelstan's niece, made Dunstan a trusted adviser and on her death she left a considerable fortune to him.<ref name="ce"/>  He used this money later in life to foster and encourage a monastic revival in England. About the same time, his father Heorstan died and Dunstan inherited his fortune as well. He became a person of great influence, and on the death of King  <U+00C6>thelstan in 940, the new King, [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], summoned him to his court at [[Cheddar]] and made him a minister.<ref name = "osv"/>

Again, royal favour fostered jealousy among other courtiers and again Dunstan's enemies succeeded in their plots. The king was prepared to send Dunstan away.<ref name="ce"/> There were then at Cheddar certain envoys from the "Eastern Kingdom", which probably meant [[East Anglia]]. Dunstan implored the envoys to take him with them when they returned to their homes. They agreed to do so, but it never happened. The story is recorded:

{{quote|... the king rode out to hunt the stag in Mendip Forest. He became separated from his attendants and followed a stag at great speed in the direction of the Cheddar cliffs. The stag rushed blindly over the precipice and was followed by the hounds. Eadmund endeavoured vainly to stop his horse; then, seeing death to be imminent, he remembered his harsh treatment of St Dunstan and promised to make amends if his life was spared. At that moment his horse was stopped on the very edge of the cliff. Giving thanks to God, he returned forthwith to his palace, called for St. Dunstan and bade him follow, then rode straight to Glastonbury. Entering the church, the king first knelt in prayer before the altar, then, taking St. Dunstan by the hand, he gave him the kiss of peace, led him to the [[abbot]]'s throne and, seating him thereon, promised him all assistance in restoring Divine worship and regular observance.<ref name="ce"/>}}

===Abbot of Glastonbury===
Dunstan, now Abbot of Glastonbury, went to work at once on the task of reform.<ref name = "osv"/> He had to re-create monastic life and to rebuild the abbey. He began by establishing [[Benedictine]] monasticism at Glastonbury.<ref name = "ODCC"/> That the Rule of St. Benedict was the basis of his restoration is not only definitely stated by his first biographer, who knew Dunstan well, but it is also in accordance with the nature of his first measures as abbot, with the significance of his first buildings, and with the Benedictine leanings of his most prominent disciples.<ref name="ce"/>[[Image:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Remains of the [[Quire (architecture)|choir]] of Glastonbury Abbey church]]

Dunstan's first care was to rebuild the Church of St. Peter, rebuild the cloister, and re-establish the monastic enclosure. The secular affairs of the house were committed to his brother, Wulfric, "so that neither himself nor any of the professed monks might break enclosure."<ref name="ce"/> A school for the local youth was founded and soon became the most famous of its time in England.<ref name = "ODCC"/>  A substantial extension of the irrigation system on the surrounding [[Somerset Levels]] was also completed.

Within two years of Dunstan's appointment, in 946, King Edmund was assassinated. His successor was [[Eadred of England|Eadred]]. The policy of the new government was supported by the [[Queen Mother]], [[Eadgifu of Kent]], by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Oda the Severe|Oda]], and by the East Anglian nobles, at whose head was the powerful [[ealdorman]] [[<U+00C6>thelstan Half-King|<U+00C6>thelstan the "Half-king"]]. It was a policy of unification and conciliation with the Danish half of the kingdom.<ref name = "co"/>  The goal was a firm establishment of royal authority. In ecclesiastical matters it favoured the spread of [[catholicism|Catholic]] observance, the rebuilding of churches, the moral reform of the clergy and laity, and the end of the [[Norse mythology|religion of the Danes]] in England.<ref name="cw"/>
Against all these reforms were the nobles of Wessex, who included most of Dunstan's own relatives, and who had an interest in maintaining established customs.<ref name="ce"/> For nine years Dunstan's influence was dominant, during which time he twice refused the office of bishop (that of Winchester in 951 and [[Bishop of Exeter|Crediton]] in 953), affirming that he would not leave the king's side so long as the king lived and needed him.<ref name = "ODCC"/>

===Changes in fortune===
In 955, Eadred died, and the situation was at once changed. [[Eadwig of England|Eadwig]], the elder son of Edmund, who then came to the throne, was a headstrong youth wholly devoted to the reactionary nobles. According to one legend, the feud with Dunstan began on the day of Eadwig's coronation, when he failed to attend a meeting of nobles. When Dunstan eventually found the young monarch, he was cavorting with a noblewoman named <U+00C6>lfgifu and her mother, and refused to return with the bishop. Infuriated by this, Dunstan dragged Eadwig back and forced him to renounce the girl as a "strumpet". Later realizing that he had provoked the king, Dunstan fled to the apparent sanctuary of his cloister, but Eadwig, incited by <U+00C6>lfgifu, whom he married, followed him and plundered the monastery.<ref name="ce"/>
[[Image:Eadwig.jpg|thumb|250px|right|King Eadwig's reign was marred by conflicts with his family and with Dunstan.]]

Although Dunstan managed to escape, he saw that his life was in danger. He fled England and crossed the channel to Flanders, where he found himself ignorant of the language and of the customs of the locals.<ref name = "ODCC"/> The [[Counts of Flanders|count of Flanders]], [[Arnulf I, Count of Flanders|Arnulf I]], received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of Mont Blandin, near [[Ghent]].<ref name="ce"/> This was one of the centres of the Benedictine revival in that country, and Dunstan was able for the first time to observe the strict observance that had seen its rebirth at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] at the beginning of the century. His exile was not of long duration. Before the end of 957, the [[Mercia]]ns and [[Northumbria]]ns revolted and drove out Eadwig, choosing his brother [[Edgar of England|Edgar]] as king of the country north of the Thames.<ref name = "co"/> The south remained faithful to Eadwig. At once Edgar's advisers recalled Dunstan.<ref name = "ODCC"/> On his return, the archbishop consecrated Dunstan a bishop and, on the death of [[Coenwald]] of [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester|Worcester]] at the end of 957, Oda appointed Dunstan to that see.<ref name=Powicke260>[[Maurice Powicke|Powicke, F. Maurice]] and E. B. Fryde ''Handbook of British Chronology'' 2nd. ed. London:Royal Historical Society 1961 p. 260</ref>

In the following year the See of [[Diocese of London|London]] became vacant and was conferred on Dunstan, who held it in conjunction with Worcester.<ref name = "osv"/><ref name=Powicke260/>  In October 959, Eadwig died and his brother Edgar was readily accepted as ruler of Wessex. One of Eadwig's final acts had been to appoint a successor to Archbishop Oda, who died on 2 June 958. First he appointed  [[<U+00C6>lfsige]] of Winchester, but he perished of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to [[Holy See|Rome]] for the [[pallium]]. In his place Eadwig nominated [[Byrhthelm]], the Bishop of Wells. As soon as Edgar became king he reversed this act on the ground that Brithelm had not been able to govern even his former diocese properly.<ref name="ce"/> The archbishopric was then conferred on Dunstan.<ref name = "ODCC"/>

==Archbishop of Canterbury (960<U+2013>78)==
Dunstan went to Rome in 960, and received the pallium from [[Pope John XII]].<ref name = "osv"/>  On his journey there, Dunstan's charities were so lavish as to leave nothing for himself and his attendants. His steward complained, but Dunstan seems to have suggested that they trust in [[Christ|Jesus Christ]].

On his return from Rome, Dunstan at once regained his position as virtual [[prime minister]] of the kingdom. By his advice [[<U+00C6>lfstan]] was appointed to the Bishopric of London, and [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]] to that of Worcester. In 963, [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester|<U+00C6>thelwold]], the Abbot of [[Abingdon Abbey|Abingdon]], was appointed to the See of Winchester. With their aid and with the ready support of King Edgar, Dunstan pushed forward his reforms in the English Church.<ref name = "osv"/>  The monks in his communities were taught to live in a spirit of self-sacrifice, and Dunstan actively enforced the law of celibacy whenever possible.<ref name="me">{{Cite book| last =Hollister  | first =C.

Monasteries were built, and in some of the great cathedrals, monks took the place of the [[Canon (priest)|secular canons]]; in the rest the canons were obliged to live according to rule. The parish priests were compelled to be qualified  for their office; they were urged to teach parishioners not only the truths of the Christian faith, but also  trades to improve their position.<ref name="cw"/> The state saw reforms as well.<ref name = "ODCC"/> Good order was maintained throughout the realm and there was respect for the law. Trained bands policed the north, and a navy guarded the shores from Viking raids. There was a level of peace in the kingdom unknown in living memory.<ref name="ce"/>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Edgarobv.2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Obverse of a penny minted for King Edgar.]] -->
In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship reached its zenith when he officiated at the coronation of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned not as the initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that must have taken a great deal of preliminary diplomacy).<ref name="wsc">{{Cite book| last =Churchill  | first =Winston | authorlink =  Winston Churchill |title =The Birth of Britain p.134 | publisher =Dodd, Mead  | year =1966 | accessdate=August 2007}}</ref> This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' forms the basis of the present-day [[Coronation of the British monarch|British coronation ceremony]].<ref name="wsc">p.134</ref> There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at [[Chester]].<ref name=schama>{{Cite book| last =Schama | first =Simon | title =A History of  Britain I  | pages =65  | publisher =BBC Books  | date =200  | accessdate=}}</ref>  Six kings in Britain, including the kings of [[Scotland]] and of [[Strathclyde]], pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.

Edgar died two years after his coronation, and was succeeded by his eldest son [[Edward the Martyr|Edward (II) "the Martyr"]].<ref name = "ODCC"/> His accession was disputed by his stepmother,  [[<U+00C6>lfthryth, Queen of England|<U+00C6>lfthryth]], who wished her own son  [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready|<U+00C6>thelred]] to reign. Through the influence of Dunstan, Eadward was chosen and crowned at Winchester.<ref name = "osv"/>  Edgar's death had encouraged the reactionary nobles, and at once there was a determined attack upon the monks, the protagonists of reform. Throughout Mercia they were persecuted and deprived of their possessions. Their cause, however, was supported by [[<U+00C6>thelstan Half-King#Family|<U+00C6>thelwine]], the ealdorman of East Anglia, and the realm was in serious danger of civil war. Three meetings of the [[Witenagemot|Witan]] were held to settle these disputes, at [[Oxfordshire|Kyrtlington]], at [[Calne]], and at [[Amesbury]]. At the second of them the floor of the hall where the Witan was sitting gave way, and all except Dunstan, who clung to a beam, fell into the room below, several men were killed.<ref name="ce"/>

==Final years (978<U+2013>88)==
In March 978, King Eadweard was assassinated at [[Corfe Castle]], possibly at the instigation of his stepmother, and [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]] became king. His coronation on [[Low Sunday]] 31 March, 978, was the last state event in which Dunstan took part.<ref name="ce"/> When the young king took the usual oath to govern well, Dunstan addressed him in solemn warning. He criticised the violent act whereby he became king and prophesied the misfortunes that were shortly to fall on the kingdom,<ref name="wsc">p.139</ref>  but Dunstan's influence at court was ended.<ref name="ODCC">p.514</ref> Dunstan retired to Canterbury, to teach at the cathedral school.<ref name = "osv"/> [[Image:MS. Hatton 30 Expositio Augustini in Apocalypsin 73v.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Theological manuscript from Glastonbury Abbey ([[Bodleian Library]]):''Abbot Dunstan ordered the writing of this book''.]]

Only three more public acts are known. In 980, Dunstan joined [[<U+00C6>lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|<U+00C6>lfhere of Mercia]] in the solemn translation of the relics of King Eadward II, soon to be known as [[Edward the Martyr|St Edward the Martyr]], from their grave at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] to a shrine at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. In 984, in obedience to a vision of [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]], he persuaded King <U+00C6>thelred to appoint [[Alphege|<U+00C6>lfheah]] as Bishop of Winchester in succession to <U+00C6>thelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]].<ref name="ce"/>

Dunstan's retirement at Canterbury consisted of long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, as well as  his regular attendance at Mass and the [[Canonical hours|daily office]]. He visited the shrines of [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] and [[<U+00C6>thelberht of Kent|St <U+00C6>thelberht]], and there are reports of a vision of angels who sang to him heavenly canticles.<ref name="ce"/> He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity.<ref name="co">[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=438 St. Dunstan <U+2013> Catholic Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On the vigil of [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] Day 988, it is recorded that a vision of angels warned he would die in three days.<ref name="ce"/> On the feast day itself, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the [[Mass (liturgy)#Liturgy of the Word|Gospel]], at the [[benediction#Christianity|benediction]], and after the [[Agnus Dei#Liturgy|Agnus Dei]]. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well.<ref name="msc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.missionstclare.com/english/people/may19.html |title=Biography: St. Dunstan |accessdate=2007-08-02 |work=Mission St. Clare}}</ref> That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received [[Extreme Unction]] and the [[Viaticum]], and died. Dunstan's final words are reported to have been, "He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him."<ref name="ce"/>

The English people accepted him as a [[saint]] shortly thereafter. He was formally [[canonised]] in 1029. That year at the Synod of Winchester, St Dunstan's feast was ordered to be kept solemnly throughout England.<ref name="ce"/>

==Legacy==
Until [[Thomas Becket]]<U+2019>s fame overshadowed Dunstan's, he was the favourite saint of the English people. Dunstan had been buried in his [[Canterbury Cathedral#Later Saxon and Viking|cathedral]]; and when that building was destroyed by a fire in 1074, his relics were translated by Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] to a tomb on the south side of the high altar in the rebuilt [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name="ce"/>

[[Image:Dunstan and the Devil - Project Gutenberg eText 13978.png|thumbnail|right|upright|Dunstan shoeing the Devil's hoof, as illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]]]]
The monks of Glastonbury used to claim that during the sack of Canterbury by the [[Viking|Danes]] in 1012, Dunstan's body had been carried for safety to their abbey. This story was disproved by Archbishop [[William Warham]], who opened the tomb at Canterbury in 1508. They found Dunstan's relics still to be there. Within a century, his shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]].<ref name="ce"/>

He functions as the [[patron saint]] of [[goldsmith]]s and silversmiths, as he worked as a [[blacksmith]], [[painting|painter]], and [[Jewellery|jeweller]]. His Feast Day is May 19, which is why the date year on [[hallmark]]s runs from May 19 to May 18, not the calendar year. [[St Dunstan's]]<U+2014>the [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provides support, rehabilitation, and respite care to blind ex-service personnel of the [[British Armed Forces]]<U+2014>is named after him, as are many churches all over the world. [[Church of St. Dunstan, Mayfield|St Dunstan's, Mayfield]], [[St Dunstan's, Stepney]], [[St Dunstan-in-the-East|St Dunstan-in-the-East, London]], and [[St Dunstan-in-the-West|St Dunstan-in-the-West, London]] are four of the more well-known in Britain.

[[English literature]] contains many references to him, for example in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], and in this folk rhyme:
{{quote|St Dunstan, as the story goes,<br/>Once pull'd the devil by the nose<br/>With red-hot tongs, which made him roar,<br/>That he was heard three miles or more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/139-may19.html|title=The Every-Day Book|accessdate=2007-08-07 |author= |last=Hone|first=William |authorlink= |coauthors=Kyle Grimes, editor  |publisher=The William Hone BioText,University of Alabama at Birmingham}}</ref>}}
From this the tongs have become a symbol of St Dunstan and are featured in the arms of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]].

Another story relates how Dunstan nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to re-shoe the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is over the door. This is claimed as the origin of the lucky horseshoe.

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]] mark his [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] on May 19.<ref name="osv">pp. 206<U+2013>207</ref>

At various passages in "[[The Deptford Trilogy]]", the character [[The Deptford Trilogy#Dunstan Ramsay|Dunstan Ramsay]] is compared with the saint of the same name, and in particular some stormy events in the character's love-life are rather humorously compared to Saint Dunstan famous struggle with Satan.
