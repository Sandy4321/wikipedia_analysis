The proposal for a university for the capital, first mooted in the Volksraad in 1889, was interrupted by the outbreak of the [[Anglo Boer War]] in 1899. In 1896 the South African School of Mines was founded in [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]]. Eight years later, in 1904, the school was moved to Johannesburg and was renamed the Transvaal Technical Institute. The school's name changed yet again in 1906 to Transvaal University College. In 1902 after the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]], the Normal College for teacher training was established in Groenkloof, Pretoria.<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=9792 University of Pretoria Historical Overview Retrieved April 24, 2010]</ref> On 4 March 1908 when the Transvaal University College (TUC) transferred its arts and science courses to its newly established [[Pretoria]] Campus the precursor to the university was established, initially offering courses in languages, sciences, and law.<ref name="britannica1">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/475582/University-of-Pretoria Universiteit Van Pretoria Retrieved April 24, 2010]</ref><ref>[http://sajg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/111/2-3/141 Special Edition in celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Geology Department at the University of Pretoria.

In 1910 the Colonial Secretary, General [[Jan Smuts]] tabled the act constituting the university as a separate entity before the Transvaal Parliament, the "Transvaalse Universiteits-Inlijvingswet" Law 1 of 1910. On 17 May 1910 the Johannesburg and Pretoria campuses separated, each becoming an independent institution.

The late 1910s and early 1920s saw the establishment of several faculties as the academic activities were expanded. Courses in agriculture (1917), theology (1918), economics and political science (1919), veterinary science (1920), and music (1923) were established as the institution grew.<ref name="britannica1"/>

===Establishment and expansion years 1929-1982===

On 10 October 1930 the University of Pretoria Private Act, No. 13 of 1930 changed the name of the TUC to the University of Pretoria.<ref>http://www.artefacts.co.za/main/Buildings/style_det.php?styleid=368 Retrieved May 21, 2011</ref> The TUC originally established as an English medium institution had evolved into the only fully bilingual university in South Africa and remained as such until the early 1930s. The rapid increase of Afrikaans speaking students brought about an imbalance between the demographics of students and the languages of instruction. By 1931, although 65% of students were Afrikaans speaking, 68% of the classes were conducted in English. In 1932 the University Council addressed the imbalance, deciding that Afrikaans would become the only medium of instruction. An increase in student numbers necessitated the building of new facilities such as the Club Hall and Administration Building (colloquially known as the ship) when the 7th faculty, the Medical Faculty,  was established in 1943.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=9792 University of Pretoria Historical Overview Retrieved 11 June 2010]</ref> This period further saw the establishment of numerous student activities such as the annual Spring Day event and intervarsity. Student publications established include the Trek in 1931, the first Rag Mag in 1936 and the weekly student newspaper, Die Perdeby in 1939.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> The period of 1948-1982 is characterised by the substantial increase in student numbers and physical growth of the university. The nearly doubling of student numbers demanded the physical expansion of the Hatfield campus and new buildings were built in quick succession as the campus grew eastward.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> In the mid 1960s, the university urgently required additional land and acquired the adjacent property of [[Christian Brothers' College, Mount Edmund|Christian Brothers' College]], Saint Gabriel's.<ref>[http://www.cbcpretoria.co.za/index.cfm/p/pages.schools-s-history.htm School's History Retrieved 11 June 2010]</ref> This property now forms the eastern section of the Hatfield campus.

During the period of 1982 to 2008 the university transformed into a bilingual, multiracial and inclusive institution. The comparatively smooth introduction of students from all races formed the initial impetus for transformation and in 1989 the University was declared officially desegregated and opened for all races. In 1993 a policy document was introduced, aiming to position the university in a newly democratic South Africa. In 1994 the university regained its status as a bilingual university when a new language policy was adopted. 

In 1999 the only two veterinary science faculties in the country, those of the University of Pretoria and Medunsa were amalgamated. The university's Onderstepoort campus once again housed the only veterinary faculty in South Africa. In 2000 the Teachers Training College Pretoria, formerly the Normal College Pretoria founded in 1902, was incorporated into the university<U+2019>s Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving to the self sufficient [[Groenkloof]] campus.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

The university<U+2019>s business school in Illovo [[Johannesburg]], the [[Gordon Institute of Business Science]], was established in January 2000 following a substantial contribution by [[Donald Gordon (South African businessman)|Sir Donald Gordon]], the founder of [[Liberty Holdings Limited|Liberty Life]] and [[Liberty International]], and a major investment by the University of Pretoria following discussions started in 1998. The now defunct [[Vista University]]'s [[Mamelodi]] campus was incorporated on 2 January 2004, as part of the restructuring of South African tertiary institutions.<ref>http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=82 Mamelodi campus.

===Other campuses===
;Onderstepoort

The possibility of training veterinarians in South Africa was frequently raised after the first Colonial Veterinary Surgeon in South Africa was appointed in approximately 1874, but it was not until 1920 that the Swiss-born veterinarian, Sir [[Arnold Theiler]], was appointed as Director of Veterinary Education and Research at Onderstepoort under the supervision of the then Transvaal University College. New facilities were inaugurated at the end of 1921 and the first residence was opened in 1924. The first eight South African trained veterinarians qualified in 1924.

The Faculty of Veterinary Sciences was developed on the 65&nbsp;hectares [[Onderstepoort]] campus, with buildings covering a total of 55 000 square meters 30&nbsp;km  north west of the Hatfield main campus and 15&nbsp;km north of the Pretoria city center.

;Groenkloof 
During the Conference of Teachers in Town and Refugee Camp Schools of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony of 1-10 July 1902 a resolution was passed to establish <U+201C>Normal Schools<U+201D> for the education of teachers in Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Pretoria Normal School, housed in a house in 126 Rissik Street commences with one student in 1902, growing to 19 by year end. In 1903 the Johannesburg Normal School's 40 students are transferred to Pretoria when it is closed and the Pretoria and Johannesburg institutions are merged to form the Transvaal Normal College. When the Transvaal University College is established in 1908 the first students include students from the Transvaal Normal College. 1909 the school is renamed the Pretoria Normal College when new teacher training facilities are established in Heidelberg and Johannesburg. In 1954 the school is again renamed to the "Onderwyskollege van Pretoria<U+201D> or Teachers College Pretoria. In 1974 the University of Pretoria took over the sole responsibility for training secondary teacher from the Teachers College Pretoria. 

Although the Teachers College Pretoria bought new college grounds in Groenkloof during 1975, the college only occupies the new grounds in 1988 and inaugurated in 1989. The Johannesburg "Goudstadse Onderwyskollege<U+201D>, Transvaal College of Education, Laudium and the Transvaal Education College Soshanguve amalgamate and move their operations to the Teachers College Pretoria in 1993 and the latter two in 1998 respectively. In 2000 the Teachers Training College Pretoria was incorporated into the university<U+2019>s Faculty of Education, which saw the faculty moving from the main Hatfield campus to the self-sufficient [[Groenkloof]] campus.<ref>[http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=43&subid=43&ipklookid=6&parentid= Welcome to the Faculty of Education.
