After playing in 79 games for Baltimore, Burns was transferred to the Brooklyn Bridegrooms by [[Harry Von der Horst]], the owner of both clubs.<ref name="Dodgers">{{cite book|title=The Dodgers Encyclopedia|last=McNeil|first=William F.|page=30|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2000|location=Champaign, Illionios|isbn=1-58261-316-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aKQ3CQYbYXkC&source=gbs_navlinks_s}}</ref> While he was playing for the Bridegrooms, the ''[[New York Clipper]]'' described Burns as "the noisiest man that ever played on the Brooklyn team.

He recorded team highs in [[on-base percentage]], batting average, and home runs hit while the Bridegrooms, with a 89<U+2013>48 record, became American Association champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BRO/1889.shtml|title=1889 Brooklyn Bridegrooms Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 9, 2011}}</ref> In the [[World Series]], the Bridegrooms played the New York Giants of the [[National League]]. Burns hit a three-run home run to win the fourth game of the series, giving Brooklyn a 3<U+2013>1 series lead. However, the Giants would take the World Series after winning five straight games.<ref name="Dodgers" />

In 1890, the Bridegrooms had moved to the National League. Burns, now 26, led the league in home runs (13) and RBI (128).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1890-batting-leaders.shtml|title=1890 National League Batting Leaders|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref> He [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] on August 1, 1890<U+2014>becoming the first Bridegroom to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/la/history/rare_feats.jsp|title=Dodgers Rare Feats|work=MLB.com|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The team won the National League pennant, and faced the [[Louisville Colonels]] in the [[1890 World Series]].

In 1893, between games of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], a teammate of Burns, [[Tom Daly (infielder)|Tom Daly]], was sleeping in [[center field]] when Burns stabbed Daly with a [[penknife]].

Burns continued to play for the club until 1895, when he played for the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. In his final MLB year, Burns batted a combined .258 over 25 games.

After the 1895 season, Burns's contract was purchased by the minor-league [[Newark Colts]]. The Colts would win the [[Atlantic League (1896<U+2013>1900)|Atlantic League]] division with a 82<U+2013>61 record, two games above the [[Hartford Bluebirds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/league.cgi?id=d3d2ae5e|title=1896 Atlantic League|work=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref> The next season, Burns served as a [[player-coach]] for the Bluebirds, where he lead the team in doubles and batting average. In his final managerial year, Burns coached [[Portland, Maine]] of the [[New England League]].
