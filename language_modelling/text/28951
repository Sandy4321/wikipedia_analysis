'''Stephen Roger "Steve" Bruce''' (born 31 December 1960) is an [[England|English]] [[association football|football]] [[coach (sports)|manager]] and former player. Born in [[Corbridge]], [[Northumberland]], he was a promising schoolboy footballer but was rejected by a number of professional clubs. He was on the verge of quitting the game altogether when he was offered an apprenticeship with [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], and went on to play more than 200&nbsp;games for the club before joining [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] in 1984. 

In 1987, he moved to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], with whom he achieved great success, winning the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup|The Football Association (FA) Cup]] and the [[Football League Cup]]. He also became the first English player of the twentieth century to captain a team to [[The Double]]. Despite his success on the field, he was never selected to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]]. Commentators and contemporaries have described him as one of the best English players of the 1980s and 1990s never to play for his country at full international level.

Bruce began his managerial career with [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], and spent short periods of time managing [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] before joining [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in 2001. He twice led Birmingham to [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Premier League]] during his tenure of nearly six years, but resigned in 2007 to begin a second spell as manager of Wigan.

Bruce, a boyhood fan of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], claims to have sneaked into [[St James' Park]] without paying to watch the team play, saying "I have always been a [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the turnstiles to get in to try and save a [[Shilling|bob]] or whatever it was.

Having been turned down by a number of professional clubs, including Newcastle United, [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]], Bruce was about to start work as an apprentice plumber at the [[Swan Hunter]] dockyard when he was offered a trial by [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] club [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], whose manager [[Gerry Summers]] had seen him playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament.<ref name="SB39">{{cite book | first=Steve|last= Bruce | title=Heading for Victory: An Autobiography| pages=pp39&ndash;40}}</ref> He travelled down to [[Kent]] with another player from the Wallsend club, [[Peter Beardsley]], but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away.<ref name="Buster2" /> At the time Bruce was playing as a [[midfielder]], but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, [[Bill Collins (footballer)|Bill "Buster" Collins]], whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.<ref name="Buster2">{{cite web

==Playing career==
===Gillingham===

At the height of his success with United, Bruce was contacted by [[Jack Charlton]], manager of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland national team]], who had discovered that, due to his mother's place of birth, Bruce was eligible to play for Ireland.

==Style of play==
During the early part of his career, Bruce's sometimes over-enthusiastic playing style, which he later described as "rampaging",<ref name="Buster2" /> caused him disciplinary problems. He later developed into a solid and dependable all-round player, characterised as "an honest trier who made the absolute most of limited natural ability".<ref name="IP">{{Cite book|title=Manchester United: The Red Army|first=Ivan|last=Ponting|pages=p177}}</ref> In his prime he was particularly noted for his calm and deliberate passing of the ball, and his ability to control it under pressure, often with his chest. At the time, [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]] of Liverpool was said to be the only other central defender able to match Bruce's level of skill in these areas.<ref name="recovery" /> 

Bruce was also known for his unusually high goalscoring rate for a central defender, resulting from a combination of his ability to powerfully head the ball and his effectiveness in taking [[penalty kick]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.setanta.com/Templates/News/NewsArticle.aspx?id=8896&epslanguage=EN|publisher=Setanta Sports|title=The XI at 11: Goalscoring centre backs|author=Adam Marshall|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> Although lacking poise and grace,<ref name="IP" /> and often criticised for his lack of pace,<ref name="IP" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F924308782B4AB3&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815|work=The Times|title=Cantona key to United's ignition &ndash; Football|author=Rob Hughes|date=1994-11-23|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> his bravery and willingness to take knocks from opposition players made him the "heart" of the defence during his time with Manchester United.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester_united/s/1017296_vidic_succeeds_as_king_bruce_|work=Manchester Evening News|title=Vidic succeeds as king Bruce|author=Mike Whalley|date=2007-09-22|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref> He was well known for continuing to play even when injured,<ref name="IP" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.examiner.ie/story/sport/qlkfsnmhql/rss2/|work=Irish Examiner|title=Masked ball for 50 in-a-row <U+2018>Killer<U+2019>|author=Liam Mackey|date=2008-09-10|accessdate=2008-09-22|quote=But Steve Bruce <U+2014> I think he played with 20 broken bones!}}</ref> including returning to the United team at short notice in 1992 even though he was awaiting an operation on a hernia.<ref name="recovery" /> His indomitable spirit and motivational abilities were deemed vital to the United team,<ref name="IP" /> and Alex Ferguson has commented on his "determination and heart".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=657703.html|publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association |title=Fergie compares captain Rooney to greats|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2008-09-10}}</ref>

===Early managerial career===
In his first season as a manager, Bruce guided Sheffield United to eighth place in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], nine points away from a place in the play-offs.<ref>{{Cite web

| accessdate= 2008-09-06}}</ref> He also caused controversy when he attempted to take his team off the pitch during an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Bruce felt that the "Gunners" had broken an unwritten rule of sportsmanship by failing to return the ball to United, who had intentionally kicked it out of play to allow an injured player to be attended to. Although the game eventually continued to a finish, it was later declared void and replayed.<ref>{{Cite news

===Return to Wigan Athletic===
In May 2007, Birmingham's board agreed a new contract for Bruce, but the unwillingness of the club's prospective purchaser [[Carson Yeung]] to ratify it left his future uncertain.<ref>{{cite news

On 21 November, during a press conference which was intended to formally present Bruce as the new manager of Wigan, the club's chief executive Brenda Spencer informed the media that the deal had been put on hold by "unknown issues" between Bruce and Birmingham City, reported to centre on the advance payment of the image rights element of Bruce's contract at [[St Andrews (stadium)|St Andrews]].<ref name=left_Birmingham_BBC2>{{cite news
