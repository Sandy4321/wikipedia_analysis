'''''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings''''' is a 1978 [[animation|animated]] [[fantasy film]] produced and directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]]. It is an adaptation of the first half of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Set in [[Middle-earth]], the film follows a group of [[Hobbit]]s, [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizards]] who form a [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] and embark on a quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] made by the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], and with it, ensure his destruction.

The film was produced mostly utilizing [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]], wherein many scenes were shot in live-action first and then traced onto animation cels. The film is notable for featuring some of the most extensive use of the technique. 

Although the film received a mixed reaction from critics, and was deemed to be a flop by the original distributors, who refused to fund a sequel that would have covered the remainder of the story, the film sparked new interest in Tolkien's writing and inspired the production of several further adaptations of the story.

==Plot==
{{spoiler}}
In the early years of the [[Second Age]] of [[Middle-earth]], the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elven]]-smiths forged [[Rings of Power]] <U+2014> nine for mortal [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]], seven for the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf-lords]], and three for the tall Elf-kings. Eventually, however, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] learned the craft of ring-making and made the [[One Ring]] to rule them all. With the One Ring, Middle-earth was his and he could not be overcome. As the [[Last Alliance|Last Alliance of Men and Elves]] fell beneath his power, the Ring fell into the hands of Prince [[Isildur]] of the mighty kings from [[N<U+00FA>menor|across the sea]], and thus Sauron was defeated. Isildur did not destroy the Ring, however, so the spirit of Sauron lived on and began to take shape and grow again. The Ring had a [[will (philosophy)|will]] of its own, and had a way of slipping from hand to hand, so that it might at last get back to its master. After Isildur was killed by [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]], the Ring lay in the bottom of the river [[Anduin]] for thousands of years. During those years, Sauron captured the nine Rings that were made for Men and turned their owners into the [[Nazg<U+00FB>l|Ringwraiths]]: terrible shadows under his great shadow who roamed the world searching for the One Ring. 

Thousands of years later, the Ring was found by two friends. One of them, Sm<U+00E9>agol, was so enticed by the Ring's power that he killed his friend [[D<U+00E9>agol]] to get it. Sm<U+00E9>agol possessed the Ring for hundreds of years, during which it warped him into a twisted, gurgling wretch known only as [[Gollum]], until his "precious" was discovered by the [[hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Years later, in a land called the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], Bilbo is celebrating his birthday. During his speech, Bilbo slips the Ring on, and confusion arises as the party notices that their host has suddenly disappeared into thin air. [[Gandalf]] the wizard, however, knows the truth behind this act. In Bilbo's hobbit hole, Gandalf tells him to leave the Ring for Frodo, but Bilbo initially refuses to give it up, ominously calling it "my Precious"<U+2014>the same name the wretched Gollum had addressed it by. Alarmed, Gandalf entreats Bilbo to give it up. Bilbo finally agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that the Shire is in danger <U+2014> evil forces have learned that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. One day, Gandalf meets with Frodo, and explains the Ring's history and the danger it poses to all of Middle-earth. Heeding Gandalf's advice, Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He hopes to reach [[Rivendell]], where he will be safe from Sauron, and where those wiser than he can decide what to do about the Ring.
[[Image:BakshiHobbits.JPG|left|thumb|220px|Pippin, Frodo, Sam, and Merry.]]
In his journey he is accompanied by three hobbit friends, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Sam Gamgee|Sam]]. From the start, they are pursued by the Ringwraiths. Narrowly escaping them, they eventually come to [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]], where they meet [[Aragorn|Strider]], another friend of Gandalf who leads them the rest of the way to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed upon the mountain of [[Weathertop]] by the [[Witch-king of Angmar|chief of the Ringwraiths]], with a "[[Morgul-blade]]", a knife imbued with evil magic. Part of the knife stays inside him, and he gets sicker as the journey progresses. They meet the Elf [[Legolas]], who sets Frodo upon his horse. The Ringwraiths catch up with them, and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the former are swept away by the enchanted river itself. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by its lord, [[Elrond]]. He meets Gandalf again, who has been held captive by his fellow wizard [[Saruman]], who plans to join with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. He also meets his uncle Bilbo, who, for a terrible moment, is once again held in sway of the Ring. Bilbo, Gandalf, and others argue about what should be done with the One Ring. Finally, Frodo volunteers to go to [[Mordor]], where the Ring can be destroyed. Frodo sets forth from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn and [[Boromir]], son of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] of the land of [[Gondor]]; [[Legolas]] the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]; [[Gimli son of Gl<U+00F3>in|Gimli]] the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]]; and Frodo's original three hobbit companions. These Nine Walkers were chosen to represent all the free races of Middle-earth and as a balance to the Nine Riders.
[[Image:Bakshi Orcs.jpg|thumb|220px|Orcs in [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].]]
Their attempt to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] is foiled by heavy snow, so they are forced to take a path under the mountains via [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], an ancient Dwarf kingdom, now full of Orcs and other evil creatures, where Gandalf falls into the abyss after battling a [[Balrog]]. The remaining eight members of the Fellowship then spend some time in the elf-haven of [[L<U+00F3>rien|Lothl<U+00F3>rien]]. Here the Lady [[Galadriel]] shows Frodo and Sam "things that were, things that are and things, that yet may be," including a possible future where the Shire is despoiled. Galadriel, it turns out, is bearer of one of the Three Rings made for Elves. Frodo offers her the One Ring, but she refuses. They leave L<U+00F3>rien by river, but Frodo realizes the Ring is having a malevolent effect on Boromir. He eventually tries to take the Ring from Frodo, who puts it on to escape him. Frodo decides to leave the others behind and continue his quest alone - but the faithful Sam insists on coming along. Later, Boromir is killed by Orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin, whom the Orcs capture, meaning to take them to Isengard through the land of [[Rohan]]. Merry and Pippin manage to escape the Orcs after the Orcs themselves are attacked by the locals, the Riders of Rohan. Fleeing into Fangorn Forest, they meet [[Treebeard]], a huge treelike creature who is no friend of the Orcs and their masters. He takes them away to safe haven.

Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, tracking Merry and Pippin, find small prints and they follow these into Fangorn Forest, where they meet a wizard dressed in white who they at first believe to be [[Saruman]], but who turns out to be their wizard friend Gandalf, whom they believed had perished in the mines of Moria. He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his battle to the death with the Balrog and his [[resurrection|reawakening]].  Gandalf assures them that Merry and Pippin are safe, and the four ride to Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]]. Gandalf persuades King [[Th<U+00E9>oden]] that his people are in danger. In the process, Saruman's agent in Edoras, [[Gr<U+00ED>ma|Gr<U+00ED>ma Wormtongue]], who had been keeping Th<U+00E9>oden subdued and weak, is expelled from the city. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas then travel to the defensive fortification [[Helm's Deep]] while Gandalf goes north in search of the king's nephew [[<U+00C9>omer]] in the North to bring as reinforcements.
[[Image:BakshiGollum.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Gollum upright eating raw fish.]] 
Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, discover Gollum stalking them, and capture him. Sam loathes and distrusts Gollum, who obviously wants only to reclaim the Ring, but Frodo pities him, and so he lets him live in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Mordor. Gollum, who is briefly torn between keeping his word to Frodo and reclaiming his "Precious," is ominously overheard to say "[[Shelob|''she'']] might help us..." as he leads Frodo and Sam to [[Cirith Ungol]]. The three also see one of the Ringwraiths, now riding a [[fell beast|flying beast]]. At Helm's Deep, Th<U+00E9>oden's forces resist an onslaught of Orcs sent by Saruman, and Gandalf arrives the next morning with the Riders of Rohan just in time <U+2014> and none escape.

==Differences from the book==
The movie makes a few deviations from the book, but overall follows Tolkien's narrative quite closely.  Many parts of the book explaining the transition from one part of the plot to another were omitted, which could make the middle part of the film somewhat difficult to follow if the viewer is unfamiliar with the story. 

===Omissions===
In the scene where Frodo finds out that his ring is the One Ring, Gandalf throws the Ring into the fireplace, as in the book, and Gandalf recites the [[Ring-inscription]] in the [[Black Speech]], but only the first two lines, after which he says the entire inscription in English <U+2014> but they never look for the inscription itself as in the book.<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Shadow of the Past"}}</ref>

The film greatly condenses Frodo's journey from Bag End to Bree; for example, [[Crickhollow]], Brandy Hall, and the [[Old Forest]] do not appear.

Aragorn carries a broken sword (presumably [[Narsil]]) up to the Rivendell section of the story where he presents it to the council. However, the sword's reforging into And<U+00FA>ril is never shown (or mentioned) in the film, even though Aragorn carries an unbroken blade for the remainder of the film. Also, Aragorn identifies it as the "sword of [[Elendil]] of Gondor", but no connection between Elendil and Isildur (his son) is stated, only that the sword was used to cut the ring from Sauron's finger.

The film omits a scene where [[Legolas]] shoots down a [[Ringwraith]]'s [[fell beast|mount]] as it flies over the river [[Anduin]]. 

Characters omitted include the whimsical and mysterious [[Tom Bombadil]] and his wife [[Goldberry]], Boromir's brother [[Faramir]], Elrond's daughter [[Arwen]], and [[Fatty Bolger]], a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. Other details omitted include the usage of "[[Nazg<U+00FB>l]]", the term for the Ringwraiths in the tongue of Mordor. 

===Modifications===
In the film's prologue it is suggested that Sauron ''learned'' the craft of Ring-making ''after'' the 19 lesser rings were made whilst in the original story it is Sauron who teaches the Elven-smiths this ability. Another scene suggests that the Last Alliance of Men and Elves were losing the war against Sauron which contradicts the original story.<ref name = "elrond">{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Council of Elrond"}}</ref> 

Some changes were cosmetic in nature. For example,  Saruman the White adopts the title "Saruman of Many Colours" as in Tolkien's novel;<ref name = "elrond"  /> however, his robes are neither white nor multicolored, but different shades of red. Legolas wears silver and grey clothes whereas in the book he is "clad in green and brown".<ref name = "council">{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Council of Elrond"}}</ref> Aragorn too wore "rusty green and brown"<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"The Ring Goes South"}}</ref> in the book whereas his garments are in different shades of brown in the film. Boromir wears a [[horned helmet]], which has no precedent in the book.

The hobbits' first encounter with a Ringwraith is treated differently: in the novel, Frodo hides separately from the other hobbits;<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"Three is Company"}}</ref> in the film, together with them.

The film includes an adaptation of the song which Frodo sings at the Prancing Pony (published as "[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]" in ''[[The Tolkien Reader]]''). The first three lines are true to Tolkien's original, but the fourth line (which can only barely be heard) goes ''"That you never would believe it, so pass the beer all round!"'' (The original version reads ''"That the man in the moon himself came down one night to drink his fill"''.<ref name = "inn">{{ME-ref|fotr|"At the Sign of the Prancing Pony"}}</ref>) However, the later line ''"With a ping and a pong the fiddle strings snapped"'' is true to the original.<ref name = "inn" /> 

The scene where the Ringwraiths arrive in the hobbits' room and begin slashing at their beds only to find that they are not there is not in the book, wherein the hobbits only find the aftermath of the attack before dawn of the next day.<ref name = "inn" /> Also, Tolkien implies that the attack was carried out by agents of the Ringwraiths in Bree, possibly including one [[Bill Ferny]], not the Ringwraiths themselves (though they were present in the town). As Aragorn states:

<blockquote>"In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people - not until they are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too."<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"Strider"}}</ref></blockquote>   
  
The High Elf [[Glorfindel]] whom the hobbits and Aragorn meet as they approach [[Rivendell]]<ref>{{ME-ref|fotr|"Flight to the Ford"}}</ref> is replaced by [[Legolas]], who appears later in the book, at the council in Rivendell.<ref name = "council" />

<!-- =How do we rephrase this properly?= A couple of the characters' names are mispronounced; [[Sauron]] is pronounced "sore-on", which should have been "{{IPA|/'s<U+0251><U+028A><U+027B><U+0252>n/}}" ([[IPA]]), and -->"[[Celeborn]]" was pronounced as "seleborn", which should have been "keleborn".<ref>{{ME-ref|rotk|Appendix E, "Prounciation of Words and Names"}}</ref>

[[<U+00C9>owyn]], Th<U+00E9>oden's niece, makes only a brief appearance and has no spoken dialogue.

The depiction of the [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle of Helm's Deep]] also differs in some details from the book. Notably, the fortress itself is called "Helm's Deep" in the film while in the book it was called the "Hornburg", and "Helm's Deep" is the name of the valley where it is located,<ref name = "helm's deep">{{ME-ref|ttt|"Helm's Deep"}}</ref> or more precisely, the ravine behind the fortress.<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#210}}</ref> The explosive-like "blasting-fire", here the "Fire of Isengard," appears as magical projectiles shot from Isengard itself. [[<U+00C9>omer]] is portrayed as a renegade who Gandalf finds; together, they save the day at Helm's Deep. In the book, he was present at the battle, and Gandalf arrives with [[Erkenbrand]].<ref name = "helm's deep" />

==Pre-production==
[[Image:RBLorcamera.jpg|thumb|left|Ralph Bakshi looks into the camera lens during the live-action shoot.]]
Director Ralph Bakshi was introduced to ''The Lord of the Rings'' during the mid-1950s, when he was working as an animator for [[Terrytoons]]. In 1957, the young animator started trying to convince people that the story could be told in animation.<ref name="Jim Hill Media">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Jim Korkis |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

In the 1970s, Bakshi, who had since achieved box office success producing adult-oriented animated films such as ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'', learned that a live-action film adaptation was being produced by United Artists, under the direction of [[John Boorman]]. According to Bakshi:

<blockquote>"I heard that Boorman was taking the three books and collapsing them into one screenplay, and I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman's part. Why would you want to tamper with anything Tolkien did?"<ref name="A.V. Club">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22810 |title=Interview with Ralph Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Tasha Robinson |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 31, 2003 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=The Onion A.V. Club |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref></blockquote>

When Boorman's [[Adaptations of The Lord of the Rings#Early efforts|proposed adaptation]] fell apart, Bakshi approached the studio and proposed that he direct a three-part animated film adaptation of the book.

<blockquote>"And here comes the horror story, right? They said fine, because Boorman handed in this 700-page script, and do I want to read it? I said, 'Well, is it all three books in one?' They said, 'Yes, but he's changed a lot of the characters, and he's added characters. He's got some sneakers he's merchandising in the middle.' I said, 'No, I'd rather not read it. I'd rather do the books as close as we can, using Tolkien's exact dialogue and scenes.' They said, 'Fine,' which knocked me down, 'because we don't understand a word Boorman wrote. We never read the books. [...] We ain't got time to read it. You understand it, Ralph, so go do it.'"<ref name="A.V. Club"/></blockquote>
[[Image:RalphSaulscouting.jpg|thumb|right|Ralph Bakshi and Saul Zaentz scouting locations in Spain for the live action shoot.]]
Across the hall from United Artists, located in the same building, was [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. 

<blockquote>"I walked across the hall [...] Dan Melnick was running MGM, he was the president, [...] I thought he would understand what ''The Rings'' meant, because UA did not. Me and Melnick walk across the hall to Mike Medavoy's office and make a deal right there. Melnick gives Medavoy his money back<U+2014>the Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out. [...] Melnick gets fired, the whole deal falls through, and this new guy takes over, I forget his name. I go to the new guy and tell him, 'Danny and I were making ''Lord Of The Rings'',' and he says, 'Lord of the what? We're not going to make this fucking picture, Ralph. We don't understand it. Danny's an idiot and we don't want to make it.'"<ref name="A.V. Club"/></blockquote>

Following this, Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz (who helped finance Bakshi's first film, ''Fritz the Cat'') and asked him if he wanted to produce ''The Lord of the Rings''. Zaentz agreed to do so. At United Artists, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts.

Before the production started, Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter<!--name?--> to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing.

<blockquote>"I had no idea that he had drawn. For me it was a big emotional experience. "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' My job was to say, 'This is what the genius said.'"<ref name="Fox News">{{cite web |url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Patrick Riley |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 7, 2000 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Fox News |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref></blockquote>

==Production==
===Screenwriting and development===
An early draft of the screenplay was written by [[Chris Conkling]], who told the bulk of a story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view.<ref name="Screenplays">{{cite web |url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm |title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Janet Brennan Croft |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=University of Oklahoma |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author [[Peter S. Beagle]] was called in for a rewrite.<ref name="Screenplays"/> According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for this movie for only $5,000 on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward, and Zaentz later reneged on these promises.<ref name="Beagle">{{cite web |url=http://www.conlanpress.com/html/zaentz_f.html |title=Beagle/Zaentz FAQ |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Conlan Press |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

At one point in the film's development, studio executives thought that the names "Saruman" and "Sauron" were too similar, and would confuse the audience, and decided that Saruman should be renamed "Aruman." This decision was eventually reversed, but some references to "Aruman" remain in the finished film.<ref name="IMDb trivia">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077869/trivia |title=Trivia |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

===Animation===
[[Image:LOTR cast.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bakshi and the ''Lord of the Rings'' cast]]
Much of the film used live-action footage which was then [[rotoscope|rotoscoped]] to produce an animated look.<ref name="Rotoscope-1">Ralph Bakshi production photos: [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/biography/images/38.html 1] [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/biography/images/39.html 2]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref> This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew arrived in [[Spain]] where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by [[Billy Barty]], while [[Sharon Baird]] served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins.<ref>[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=5 Bakshi.com gallery image]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref> Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film,<ref name="Deleted scenes">[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/films.php?film=thelordoftherings_bonus Deleted scenes at the official Ralph Bakshi website]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref><ref name="Hobbits">[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=18 Bakshi.com gallery image]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref> very little of it appears in the final film. 

Of the rotoscoping, Bakshi stated:

<blockquote>"I didn't start thinking about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved back and forth on the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/></blockquote>

Following the live-action shoot, each frame of the live footage was then broken down into individual frames, printed out, and placed behind animation cels. The details of each frame were copied and painted onto cels. Both the live-action and animated sequences were storyboarded.<ref name="Rotoscope-2">Bakshi.com Gallery Images: [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=20 1] [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=10 2] [http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=11 3]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref>

<blockquote>"Making two pictures [The live action reference and the actual animated feature.] in two years is crazy. Most directors when they finish editing, they are finished; we were just starting. I got more than I expected. The crew is young. The crew loves it. If the crew loves it, it's usually a great sign. They aren't older animators trying to snow me for jobs next year."<ref name="Jim Hill Media"/></blockquote>

The film's score was composed by [[Leonard Rosenman]]. Bakshi had wanted to include music by [[Led Zeppelin]], but was unable to get the rights to do so.<ref name="Forum">{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=10816#10816 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #6 |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> During the battle of Helm's Deep, a song with non-English lyrics is heard on the soundtrack. The words ''Isengard'' and ''Mordor'' can be clearly discerned. However, it is not in Quenya nor Sindarin, nor even in the Black Speech. For the song, composer [[Leonard Rosenman]] had his choir sing nonsense lyrics to get the desired effect.<ref name="IMDb trivia"/>

===Sequel===

The film was originally intended to be distributed as ''The Lord of the Rings Part 1''.<ref name="A.V. Club"/><ref name="Fox News"/> According to Bakshi: 

<blockquote>"When I finished the film, under tremendous deadline pressure, they said, 'We're dropping the Part One. People won't come in to see half a movie.' I told them they can't drop the Part One, because people are going to come in thinking they'll see the whole film, and it's not there. We had a huge fight, and they released it as ''Lord Of The Rings''. So when it came to the end, people were stunned in the theater, even worse than I ever realized they would be, because they were expecting to see the whole film. People keep telling me I never finished the film. And I keep saying, 'That's right!'"<ref name="A.V. Club"/></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Had it said 'Part One,' I think everyone would have respected it. But because it didn't say 'Part One,' everyone came in expecting to see the entire three books, and that's where the confusion comes in."<ref name="Fox News"/></blockquote> In interviews, Bakshi sometimes refers to the film as ''The Lord of the Rings Part 1.'' According to Bakshi, a few A and [[B-roll]]s were shot for Part 2, but no other work was done.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphbakshi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=9594#9594 |title=Bakshi Board Exclusive Interview #3 |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Ralph Bakshi Forum |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> In 2006, Bakshi stated that if he were given the opportunity to finish ''The Lord of the Rings'', he would.<ref name="Forum"/>

==Reception==
Critics were generally mixed in their responses to the film.  [[Roger Ebert]] called Bakshi's effort a "mixed blessing" and "an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job ... [which] still falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story.<ref name="Ebertreview">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19780101/REVIEWS/801010307/1023 |title=Review of ''The Lord of the Rings'' |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Roger Ebert |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 1, 1978 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Chicago ''Sun-Times'' |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the film "both numbing and impressive."<ref name="Canbyreview">{{cite web |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%2c%20The%20%28Movie%29&title2=&reviewer=VINCENT%20CANBY&pdate=19781115&v_id=30049 |title=Review of ''The Lord of the Rings'' |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Vincent Canby |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1978 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=New York ''Times'' |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Film website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 50%.<ref name="Tomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movie-1012711/reviews.php |title=Tomatometer for ''The Lord of the Rings'' |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The film grossed $30,471,420 at the [[box office]]<ref name="IMDb-business"/><ref name="Box Office">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lordoftherings78.htm |title=Box office data for ''The Lord of the Rings'' |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> (the budget was $8 million).<ref name="IMDb-business"/> United Artists believed the film to be a [[List of flops in entertainment|flop]], and refused to fund a sequel which would have completed Tolkien's story on film.

However, the success of Bakshi's film sparked enough interest in Tolkien's work to provoke not only an animated [[TV special]] produced by the [[Rankin-Bass]] animation studio based on ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', but a complete [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] on [[BBC Radio]]. For this broadcast, Michael Graham Cox and Peter Woodthorpe reprised their roles of Boromir and Gollum, respectively.

Bakshi's film has also been cited as an influence on director Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|film trilogy]] based on ''The Lord of the Rings''. Jackson first encountered ''The Lord of the Rings'' via Bakshi's film,<ref>[[Peter Jackson]], as quoted at the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], on February 6th, 2004. [http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 Audio]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref> and is quoted as saying of the film, "I enjoyed it and wanted to know more."<ref name="Jackson">Peter Jackson interview, ''Explorations'' (the Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter), October/November 2001. [http://chud.com/forums/showthread.php?t=38299 Link]; [http://chud.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-38299.html Archive]; Retrieved on [[2006]]-[[November 29|11-29]].</ref>

Jackson's adaptations borrow heavily from Bakshi's version, most notably the scene of the Nazg<U+00FB>l appearing in the room at Bree and slashing the beds to ribbons thinking the shapes under the sheets to be the hobbits. This is almost identical to Bakshi's version which is significant as the scene is not depicted as described in the book: in the book, it is implied that people from Bree carried out the attack, not the Nazg<U+00FB>l (as covered above). 

On the DVD commentary of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.

[[Warner Bros.]] (the rights holder to the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library and most of the Saul Zaentz theatrical backlog) has released ''The Hobbit,'' ''The Lord of the Rings,'' and ''The Return of the King'' on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]], both packaged separately and as a boxed-set "trilogy" of films. In 2003, the [[Online Film Critics Society]] ranked the film as the 90th greatest animated film of all time.<ref name="OFCS">{{cite web |url=http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/pages/pr/top100animated  |title=Top 100 Animated Features of All Time |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Online Film Critics Society]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>
