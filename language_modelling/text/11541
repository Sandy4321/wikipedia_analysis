Declaration '''On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia''' ({{lang-lv|Deklar<U+0101>cija Par Latvijas Republikas neatkar<U+012B>bas atjauno<U+0161>anu}}) was adopted on [[4 May]] [[1990]] by [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR]]. The Declaration stated that, although Latvia had ''[[de facto]]'' lost its independence in 1940, when it was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]], the country had ''[[de jure]]'' remained a sovereign country as the annexation had been unconstitutional and against the will of people of Latvia. Therefore it recognized that [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]] were illegal, annulled declaration On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union of [[21 July]] [[1940]], reinstitututed [[Constitution of Latvia]] of 1922, which was thereupon partly suspended, and set a period of transition to [[de facto]] independence, which would end upon first session of [[Saeima]]. It also ruled that during the transitional period Constitution of Latvian SSR and other laws would remain applicable as long as they do not contradict 1, 2, 3, and 6 articles of Constitution of Latvia, which were reinforced by the declaration. It was provided that a committee to elaborate new edition of Constitution of Latvia should be created. Social, economical and culture rights and political rights were granted to citizens and residents of Latvia in accordance with international [[human rights]]. The declaration also stated that Latvia will form its relationship with Soviet Union on basis of Soviet-Latvian Peace treaty of 1920, in which Soviet Union had recognized everlasting independence of Latvia.

==Overview==
===Historical and juridical background===
In its beginning the Declaration establishes several historical facts and on basis of these facts concludes that Republic of Latvia ''de jure'' is a sovereign country. It observes that Republic of Latvia proclaimed independence on [[18 November]] [[1918]] and was internationally recognized in 1920, and that Latvia was admitted to membership in the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.<ref name="dec">{{cite web

On [[23 August]] [[1939]] Soviet Union and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], which included a secret protocol dividing [[Eastern Europe]] into [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. Latvia was apportioned to the Soviet sphere and on [[5 October]] [[1939]] signed mutual assistance pact. On [[16 June]] [[1940]] Soviet Union made [[ultimatum]] to Latvia accusing it for not carrying out the treaty, namely forming a [[Baltic Entente|military alliance against USSR]], and requested a new government to be formed and to guarantee Soviet military free entrance in Latvia.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Latvian government decided to give in to the ultimatum and on [[17 June]] [[1940]] Soviet forces entered in Latvia.<ref name="Freibergs J."/> The Declaration states that Soviet ultimatum and military aggression on [[17 June]] [[1940]] should be viewed as international crime, which led to occupation of Latvia and loss of its sovereignty and points that the new government was formed as dictated by Soviet Union and by [[international law]] should not be viewed as executive of Latvia as it represented Soviet, not Latvian, interests.<ref name="dec"/> On [[14 July|14]]-[[15 July]] [[1940]] a parliament called the "People's Saeima of Latvia" was elected, which on [[21 July]] [[1940]] declared accession to the Soviet Union.<ref name="Freibergs J."/> The declaration states that the election of People's Saeima took place on basis of unconstitutional and illegally adopted election law in state of political terror and notes that of 17 lists submitted for the election only one was allowed to participate in the election, which had not stated prior to the election that Soviet power should be established in Latvia and it should join the Soviet Union and that results of the election were falsificated. The declaration observes that the People's Saeima was formed by misleading the people and therefore did not express the sovereign will of people of Latvia. It also notes that People's Saeima had no right to change the [[political system]] in Latvia and liquidate its sovereignty as only the people have such right and the issue was never submitted to a national referendum. Therefore the Declaration rules that in accordance with [[international law]] annexation of Latvia to Soviet Union is not valid and Republic of Latvia is still ''de jure'' subject of international law recognized by more than 50 countries.<ref name="dec"/>

===Basis===
After concluding that Republic of Latvia ''de jure'' is a sovereign country the Declaration makes note of previously adopted documents and explains that Supreme Soviet is acting in the will of inhabitants of Latvia. First it notes two previous declarations of Supreme Soviet - On sovereignty of state of Latvia of [[28 July]] [[1989]], which declared that Latvian SSR will act as a sovereign state and that laws adopted by the Soviet Union will come in force in territory of Latvian SSR only if the Supreme Soviet has ratified them and In question of independence of Latvia of [[15 February]] [[1990]], in which Supreme Soviet condemns declaration On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union of [[21 July]] [[1940]], however none of these explicitly called for secession from Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web

Then it is stated that Supreme Soviet is acting in accordance with the will of inhabitants of Latvia, which had been clearly expressed by electing as a majority those deputies, who had stated that they will restore independence of Republic of Latvia in their reelection programme.<ref name="dec"/>

=== Act ===
After establishing that Republic of Latvia is ''de jure'' is a sovereign country and that by will of its people it should be independent the Supreme Soviet ruled:<br />
1. To recognize priority of international laws over nationals laws. To hold to be illegitimate the treaty between USSR and Germany of [[23 August]] [[1939]] and consequential liquidation of independence of Latvia resulting from Soviet military aggression on [[17 June]] [[1940]].<br />
2. To proclaim declaration On accession of Latvia to Soviet Union of [[21 July]] [[1940]] to be void from the moment of adoption.<br />
3. To re-establish the authority of the [[Constitution of Latvia]]. The official name of state of Latvia is Republic of Latvia, shortly - Latvia.<br />
4. To suspend Constitution of Latvia until a new edition is adopted, except for the articles, which in accordance with the 77 article of the Constitution can only be amended if submitted to a national referendum:
<blockquote>
1. ''Latvia is an independent democratic republic.''<br/>2. ''The sovereign power of the State of Latvia is vested in the people of Latvia.''<br/>3. ''The territory of the State of Latvia, within the borders established by international agreements, consists of Vidzeme, Latgale, Kurzeme and Zemgale.''<br/>6. ''The Saeima shall be elected in general, equal and direct elections, and by secret ballot based on proportional representation.''
</blockquote>
The 6 article shall be applied when those governmental institutions of independent Latvia will be restored, which grant free elections.<br />
5. To set a period of transition to de facto independence until first session of the new Saeima. During the transitional period the state highest power belongs to [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia]].<br />
6. During the transitional period Constitution of Latvian SSR and other laws of Latvian SSR in force at the time when declaration was made may be applicable as long as they do not contradict 1,2,3, and 6 articles of Constitution of Latvia. Disputes over applicability of laws shall be resolved by 
Constitutional Court. During the transitional period laws shell be made or amended only by the Supreme Council.<br />
7. To constitute a committee, which will elaborate new edition of Constitution of Latvia, suitable to current political, economical and social state of Latvia.<br />
8. In accordance with international [[human rights]], to grant social, economical and culture rights to Citizens of Latvia and other countries, who reside in territory of Latvia. This shall fully apply to those Citizens of Soviet Union who will chose to reside in Latvia without its citizenship.<br />
9. To build Latvian-Soviet relationships upon Latvian-Soviet peace treaty of [[11 August]] [[1920]] in which recognizes eternal independence of Latvia and is still in force. To constitute a committee for negotiations with USSR.<ref name="dec"/>

==Soviet reaction==
On [[4 May]] [[1990]] after the declaration was adopted [[Communist Party of Latvia]] resolved that it was unconstitutional, contained notable contradictions and historical inaccuracies, noting that such issue should be decided in referendum. Communist Party deemed that declaration might trigger the [[President of the Soviet Union]] to take countermeasures, therefore the party should launch a propaganda campaign against the declaration and ask the President of the Soviet Union to annul the declaration of Supreme Soviet.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Furthermore Supreme Council announced that the Supreme Soviet as the legal successor of People's Saeima had right to annul its decisions which contradicted the [[Constitution of Latvia]] which was in force at the time these decisions were made and as the Constitution of the Soviet Union ruled that Soviet Union was founded upon principles of [[self-determination]], but Latvia was forcibly annexed reference to it had no juridical basis regarding Latvian SSR. It also noted that law of Soviet Union regarding secession from Soviet Union to which decree also referred was not in force in territory of Latvian SSR as the Supreme Soviet had not ratified it and that the law contradicted Constitution of the Soviet Union and Constitution of Latvian SSR, which provided that Soviet Unions can freely secede from the Soviet Union. It was stated that call for referendum on secession from Soviet Union to take place has neither legal or political basis, because Latvia had been annexed by the Soviet Union without holding a referendum, which was required by the Constitution of Latvia and Latvia was not seceding from Soviet Union, but restoring its independence, it was noted that the Constitution of Latvian SSR did not call for referendum as it had been stated in the decree, but recommended two alternatives - either referendum or public debate which had ''de facto'' taken place as it had been discussed in press and several public opinion polls had taken place showing that majority of public supported independence. Similarly in All-Latvian congress of people deputies of [[21 April]] [[1990]] 8003 had voted for restoration of independence and the declaration had been adopted by vote of two thirds of members of the Supreme Soviet which was required for constitutional amendments, furthermore the Supreme Council referred to result of elections of Supreme Soviet as clear indicator of public opinion as supporters of independence had won the election.  Supreme Council stated that until [[28 May]] [[1990]] it had received letters and telegrams from 646 726 residents of the Republic supporting the declaration and only 8 993 people had expressed opposition. Given these provisions Supreme Council stated that the Declaration was legitimate and in force.<ref>{{cite web
