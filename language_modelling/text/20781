The '''Oregon Supreme Court''' is the highest [[state court]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. The only court that may reverse or modify a decision of the Oregon Supreme Court is the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref name="SOS2"/> The OSC holds court at the Supreme Court building in [[Salem, Oregon]] near the [[Oregon State Capitol|capitol]] building on State Street.

==Election==
The court has seven elected [[judge|justices]], each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. They choose one of their own to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be [[United States citizen]]s, Oregon [[resident]]s for at least three years, and lawyers [[bar (law)|admitted]] to practice in Oregon. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another qualified person to the position. To keep that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next [[general election]]. On occasion, a judge will leave office at the end of a term, in which case a general election determines their replacement.<ref name="SOS2"/>

==Administrative==
The Chief Justice serves as administrative head of the [[Oregon Department of Justice]].<ref name="SOS2"> {{cite web  | title = Oregon Supreme Court   | work = Oregon Blue Book  | publisher = Oregon Secretary of State  | url =  http://www.bluebook.state.or.us/state/judicial/judicial01.htm  | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}</ref>
In that role, he or she supervises the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]], Oregon's circuit courts, and the [[Oregon Tax Court]]. The Chief Justice is also responsible for the judicial department<U+2019>s budget, appointing chief [[judge]]s of the lower courts, and making any regulations and rules of the courts.<ref name="SOS2"/>

The Court can also appoint retired judges, lawyers, and other judges to serve [[Pro tempore|temporarily]] as judges at any level in Oregon.<ref name="SOS2"/> The state supreme court also is responsible for admitting new lawyers to practice in Oregon, disciplining [[attorney]]s and judges in the state, and appointing members to the [[Board of Bar Examiners]].<ref name="SOS2"/>

==Powers & jurisdiction==
[[Image:OregonSupremeCourtBldg.jpg|thumb|The Oregon Supreme Court]]
The powers of the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution<U+2019>s Article VII.<ref name="SOS2"/> Like other supreme courts in the [[United States]], the Oregon Supreme Court acts primarily as a [[court of appeal]]s. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions.<ref name="SOS2"/> The state supreme court has original jurisdiction in legal disciplinary areas, writs of [[mandamus]], writs [[quo warranto]], and writs of [[habeas corpus]].<ref name="SOS2"/> The court also reviews death penalty cases, tax court appeals, reapportionment of legislative districts, and challenges to [[ballot measure]] titles.<ref name="SOS2"/>

==History==
The Oregon Supreme Court traces its roots back to the early settlement period of [[Oregon Country]]. In [[1841]] pioneer [[Ewing Young]] died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of [[Idaho]], [[Washington]], and Oregon.<ref name="PDoOH">{{cite book  | last = Clarke  | first = S.A.  | title = Pioneer Days of Oregon History  | publisher = J.K. Gill Company  | year = 1905}}</ref>
In February of that year settlers met at [[Champoeg Meetings|Champoeg]] to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young<U+2019>s estate.<ref name="PDoOH"/> Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and [[mountain men]] did elect a supreme judge to exercise [[probate]] powers.<ref name="PDoOH"/> The first judge was Dr. [[Ira L. Babcock]], serving from Feb. 18, 1841-May 1, 1843.<ref name="SOS"> {{cite web  | title = Oregon Supreme Court Justices  | work = Oregon Blue Book  | publisher = Oregon Secretary of State  | url =  http://www.bluebook.state.or.us/state/elections/elections27.htm  | accessdate = 2006-12-09 }}</ref>
Other judges were appointed and elected during the pre-territory period over the next seven years. In [[1848]], when the [[Oregon Territory]] was created by [[Congress]], [[William P. Bryant]]  was appointed as the first judge of the Oregon Supreme Court.<ref name="SOS"/> Justices in the territorial period were appointed by the [[President of the United States]].<ref name="SOS"/>

In those early days of the court, the justices would <U+201C>[[Circuit rider (U.S. Court system)|ride circuit]]<U+201D> in addition to their appellate court functions. Riding circuit involved acting as appeals court judges around the state in addition to the supreme court functions of ultimate appeal, a common practice in early American courts.<ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/JusticesExplanation.html Justices of the United States Supreme Court] (explanation of terms)</ref> Beginning with statehood in [[1859]], the court had just four justices, one for each judicial district in the state.<ref name="horner">{{cite book| last = Horner| first = John B.| title = Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature| publisher = The J.K. Gill Company:Portland, Oregon| date = 1929| id =  258}}</ref> Each justice was assigned one district, and then all justices would gather and set intervals to confer on appeals.<ref name="horner"/> On appeals, the justice who presided over the lower court case would not participate in the proceedings.<ref name="horner"/> Then in [[1862]] the court was expanded to five justices with the addition of a fifth judicial district. With the creation of a Court of Appeals and separate Supreme Court in [[1878]], riding circuit was abandoned<ref name="SOS"/> and the Supreme Court reduced to three members.<ref name="horner"/> Governor [[W. W. Thayer|Thayer]] then appointed [[James K. Kelly]], [[Reuben P. Boise]], and [[Paine Page Prim]] to the court as temporary justices until elections could be held. 

In 1906 the Oregon court upheld a maximum hour law for women in ''State v. Muller'', 48 Or. 252, 85 P. 855 (1906). Due partly to a [[Brandeis brief|brief]] by future U.S. Supreme Court justice [[Louis Brandeis]], the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Oregon law in ''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'', 208 U.S. 412 (1908) despite ruling in 1905 in ''[[Lochner v. New York]]'' that a maximum hour law for bakers was unconstitutional.<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/capitalism/robes_brandeis.html PBS.org: Louis Dembitz Brandeis]</ref> Then in [[1910]], the state legislature expanded the court back to five justices, and lastly, in [[1913]] the court expanded to the current seven justices.<ref name="SOS"/>
[[Image:ORSCcourtroomdoors2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Stained glass]] above the [[courtroom]] entrance.]]
The next important case came in 1935 when the state<U+2019>s top court ruled in ''State v. De Jonge'', 152 Or. 315, 51 P.2d 674 (1935) that the [[14th Amendment]] did not protect [[Communist Party]] organizers from prosecution under Oregon<U+2019>s criminal syndicate law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court would over turn this decision in ''[[DeJonge v. Oregon]]'', 299 U.S. 353 (1937). Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in ''State Land Board v. United States'', 222 Or. 40, 352 P.2d 539 (1960). In that case the court ruled that state [[estate]] laws trumped a federal statute concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at [[Veterans Administration]] hospitals without a valid will. The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court<U+2019>s decision in ''[[United States v. Oregon]]'', 366 U. S. 643 (1961).<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/366/643/case.html 366 US 643]</ref>

On the administrative end of the court, in 1981 the [[Oregon Legislature]] and justice Arno Denecke reformed the chief justice position from a simple head of the court in title only, to the administrative head of the entire Oregon judicial system.<ref name=carson>Wong, Peter. Chief justice is retiring. Statesman Journal, December 30, 2006.</ref> The following year, 1982, the court received its first female member when Governor [[Vic Atiyeh]] appointed [[Betty Roberts]] as an associate justice.<ref>[http://www.abanet.org/women/bios/roberts.pdf ABA: Betty Roberts]</ref> Then from 1991 to 2005 Wallace P. Carson, Jr. served as chief justice of the court for a record 14 years.<ref name=carson/>

The next landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving the Oregon Supreme Court was ''[[Dolan v. City of Tigard]]'', 512 U.S. 374 (1994). In that [[land use]] case the Oregon court found the requirements placed on the business owner as conditions to approve an expansion were not a taking under the United States Constitution<U+2019>s takings clause.<ref>''Dolan v. City of Tigard'', 317 Or. 110, 854 P.2d 437 (1993)</ref> However, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the Oregon court. Then the Oregon court ruled in February of 2006 that Oregon<U+2019>s land use law, [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)|Measure 37]], was constitutional. ''MacPherson v. Department of Administrative Services'', 340 Or. 117, 130 P.3d 308 (2006) allowed people to make claims against the government forcing the government to either pay compensation when land use regulations reduced the value of a property owners land or waive the regulation.<ref>[http://www.portlandonline.com/index.cfm?c=djjga Portland Online: City of Portland and Measure 37]</ref>
