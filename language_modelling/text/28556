'''Edwin Nadason Thumboo''' (born 22 November 1933) is an award-winning [[Singapore]]an [[poet]] and [[academia|academic]] who is regarded as one of the pioneers of [[literature of Singapore#Literature in English|English literature in Singapore]].

Thumboo graduated in English from the [[National University of Singapore#History|University of Malaya]] in 1956. Although he applied for a position at the university, he was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore worked in the [[civil service]] for about nine years before finally joining the university, then renamed the University of Singapore, in 1966 following [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]]. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the university in 1970. Thumboo rose to the position of full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. After the merger of the University of Singapore and [[Nanyang University]] in 1980 to form the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean. Thumboo was the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005, and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since retiring from full-time teaching in September 1997.

Thumboo's poetry is inspired by [[myth]] and history, and he is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial [[poet laureate]] because of his poems with [[nationalism|nationalistic]] themes. A pioneer of local English literature, he compiled and edited some of the first [[anthology|anthologies]] of English poetry and [[fiction]] from Singapore and [[Malaysia]]. His own collections of poetry include ''Rib of Earth'' (1956), ''Gods Can Die'' (1977), ''Ulysses by the Merlion'' (1979) and ''A Third Map'' (1993). His latest anthology ''Still Travelling'', consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008. Thumboo has won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Awards for Poetry three times, in 1978, 1980 and 1994. He has also received the inaugural [[S.E.A. Write Award]] (1979), the first [[Cultural Medallion|Cultural Medallion for Literature]] (1980), the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Cultural and Communication Award (Literature) (1987), and the [[Raja Rao|Raja Rao Award]] (2002). He was conferred a ''[[Bintang Bakti Masyarakat]]'' (Public Service Star) in 1981 with an additional Bar in 1991, and the ''[[Pingat Jasa Gemilang]]'' (Meritorious Services Medal) in 2006.

==Early years==
Edwin Thumboo, born in [[Singapore]] on 22 November 1933, was one of eight children of a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] schoolteacher and a [[Teochew people|Teochew Chinese]]-[[Peranakan]] housewife from a [[Singapore]]an merchant family.<ref name=NLB>{{citation|title=Singapore literary pioneers: Edwin Thumboo|url=http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/literarypioneers/writers/english/edwinthumboo/index.php|publisher=[[National Library Board]]|accessdate=2008-08-13}}.</ref> He and his siblings grew up speaking English and [[Teochew (dialect)|Teochew]]. The family was financially comfortable; their home in [[Mandai]] was the only one in the neighbourhood with electricity. Because of his mixed parentage, as a child he was sometimes called names and marginalized. This was said to have fostered determination and self-respect in him.<ref name=ST>{{citation|author=Stephanie Yap|title=Poet in motion|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Life!)|date=11 August 2008]|page=C4}}.</ref> He completed his primary education at Pasir Panjang Primary School in 1940.<ref name=NLB/> During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] (1942<U+2013>1945), he helped his family by selling cakes, tending goats, and working as a salesboy. Following the war, he studied at [[Monk's Hill Secondary School]] (finishing there in 1946) and [[Victoria School]] (1948).<ref name=NLB/> It was at the latter place that he began writing poetry at the age of 17 years, encouraged by the senior English master Shamus Frazer. Thumboo considers Frazer his spiritual father, and later dedicated ''Rib of Earth'' (1956), his first collection of poetry published while an undergraduate, to him.<ref name=ST/><ref name=STE>{{citation|contribution=Thumboo, Edwin|editor=Tommy Koh|title=Singapore: The Encyclopedia|location=Singapore|publisher=Editions Didier Millet in association with the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|year=2006|isbn=981-4155-63-2|page=564}}.</ref> At this time, Thumboo was also a member of the Youth Poetry Circle, which counted among its members other early literary pioneers of Singapore such as [[Goh Sin Tub]] and Lim Thean Soo.<ref name=NLB/>

==Education and career==
[[Image:NUS, Arts & Social Sciences 3, Nov 06.JPG|thumb|A view of the [[National University of Singapore#Arts and Social Sciences|Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences]], [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS) at Kent Ridge on [[25 November]] [[2006]]. Thumboo was Dean of the Faculty from 1980 to 1991, making him NUS's longest-serving dean.]]

Thumboo majored in English literature and history at the [[National University of Singapore#History|University of Malaya]]. As a [[freshman]], he was a member of the editorial board of ''Fajar'' (''Dawn'' in [[Malay language|Malay]]), a radical [[left-wing politics|leftist]] journal published by the University Socialist Club. The seventh issue of ''Fajar'' which appeared in May 1954 contained an editorial entitled "Aggression in Asia" which advocated independence from the United Kingdom. Three days later, Chinese [[middle school]] students clashed with the police. As a result, after two weeks Thumboo was arrested by the British colonial government together with seven other students and put on trial for [[sedition]]. [[Minister Mentor]] and former [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]], who was the Club's legal adviser and a ''Fajar'' subscriber, arranged for British [[Queen's Counsel]] [[D. N. Pritt]] to act in their defence, with Lee himself as junior counsel. The students were acquitted of the charge by District Judge F. A. Chua.<ref name=STE/><ref>{{citation|contribution=''Fajar'' trial|editor=Tommy Koh|title=Singapore: The Encyclopedia|location=Singapore|publisher=Editions Didier Millet in association with the [[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|year=2006|isbn=981-4155-63-2|page=188}}.</ref>

Thumboo graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with honours (B.A. (Hons.)) in English in 1956. Hoping to teach and pursue a further degree, he applied for a position at the university but was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore entered the [[civil service]], working for the Income Tax Department (1957<U+2013>1961), [[Central Provident Fund Board]] (1961<U+2013>1965), and the Singapore Telephone Board (1965<U+2013>1966) where he was an assistant secretary.<ref name=Infopedia>{{citation|author=Sharon Teng|title=Edwin Thumboo|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1329_2007-11-06.html|publisher=Singapore Infopedia, [[National Library Board]]|date=4 November 2007|accessdate=2008-08-14}}.</ref> In 1966, the year following [[history of the Republic of Singapore#Independence of Singapore|Singapore's independence]], he joined the [[National University of Singapore#History|University of Singapore]] as an assistant lecturer. Conducting doctoral research into African poetry in English, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the university in 1970.<ref>{{citation|author=Edwin Thumboo|title=A Study of African Poetry in English: Personality, Intention and Idiom [unpublished Ph.D. thesis]|location=Singapore|publisher=Dept. of English, University of Singapore|year=1970}}.</ref> He became a full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993. The University of Singapore and [[Nanyang University]] merged in 1980 to form the [[National University of Singapore]] (NUS), and he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1991, NUS's longest-serving dean.<ref name=ST/>

As an academic, he taught [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean drama]], the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poets]], Malaysian and [[Literature of Singapore|Singaporean literatures]], and [[creative writing]], among other subjects. His research interests included the [[modern novel]] ([[E. M. Forster]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Joseph Conrad]]) and the novels of [[British Empire|Empire]] (such as [[Rudyard Kipling]]), [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] literature (including [[Botswana]] writer [[Bessie Head]]), and [[William Shakespeare]]'s Roman plays. When he headed the English Department, it introduced the study of Commonwealth/[[Postcolonial literature|New Literatures]] in English, and of [[English language]] as a major so that graduates would be better equipped to teach English in schools and [[junior college]]s.<ref name=CFA>{{citation|title=Edwin Thumboo|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070417213340/http://www.nus.edu.sg/NUSinfo/CFA/Prof%27s/biodata.html|publisher=Centre for the Arts, [[National University of Singapore]]|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=2008-08-13}}.</ref> Thumboo was appointed a [[Fellow|Professorial Fellow]] by NUS in 1995<ref name=NLB/> and continues to be associated with the university as an emeritus professor, a position he has held since he retired from full-time teaching in September 1997. He served as the first Chairman and Director of the university's Centre for the Arts from 1993 to 2005.<ref name=ST/>

Thumboo also held visiting professorships and fellowships at universities in Australia, the UK and the US. He was [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]]-Hayes Visiting Professor at [[Pennsylvania State University]] (1979<U+2013>1980); Chairman of the Association for Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies, VII Triennium (1983<U+2013>1986); Writer-in-Residence at the Institute of Culture and Communication, [[Hawaii]] (1985); Ida Beam Professor at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1986; a member of the International Advisory Panel at the East-West Centre, Hawaii (1987); Honorary Research Fellow at [[University College London|University College, University of London]] (1987); a member of the Committee of Jurors for the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] in [[Oklahoma]], USA (1988); CAS<U+2013>Miller Visiting Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (1998), Visiting Professor and Writer-in-Residence at [[University of Wollongong]] in [[New South Wales]] (1989); and Visiting Fellow at the Department of English, [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] (1993).<ref name=STE/><ref name=CFA/> In 1991, Thumboo worked with the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] to help establish the Creative Arts Programme for [[secondary school]] and [[junior college#Singapore|junior college]] students in Singapore.

==Poetry and influence==
[[File:Merlion 3, Dec 05.JPG|thumb]]
[[Image:EdwinThumboo-UlyssesbytheMerlion-20080321.jpg|thumb|Thumboo's ''Ulysses by the Merlion'' (1979) mounted on a plaque near the [[Merlion]] statue that faces [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]]]]

In the 1950s, Thumboo wrote mostly [[lyrical poetry]] based on personal experiences. Displaying the influence of the [[English literature|English literary tradition]] on him, they dealt with [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes. By the mid-1970s, he had shifted his focus to the public sphere, believing that poets of post-independence Singapore should work towards creating a national literature. Singapore's national life was a key subject of his collection of poetry ''Gods Can Die'' (1977), and it has been said that the subsequent [[anthology|anthologies]] ''Ulysses by the Merlion'' (1979) and ''A Third Map'' (1993) "established his reputation as a national poet committed to articulating a cultural vision for a multicultural Singapore".<ref name=Infopedia/> Thumboo is often dubbed Singapore's unofficial [[poet laureate]] because of his poems with [[nationalism|nationalistic]] themes, notably ''9th of August <U+2013> II'' (1977),<ref>Singapore's [[National Day]] is celebrated on [[9 August]].</ref> and ''Ulysses by the Merlion'' (1979)<ref>The poem can be read at {{citation|title=Ulysses by the Merlion|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070418025451/www.nus.edu.sg/NUSinfo/CFA/Prof%27s/poems/ulysses.html|publisher=Centre for the Arts, [[National University of Singapore]]|date=11 July 2005|accessdate=2008-08-14}}.</ref> which was published in the anthology of the same name. ''Ulysses'', which references an iconic statue of a beast with the upper body of a lion and the tail of a fish called the [[Merlion]] that faces [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]], was inspired by the use of [[Irish mythology]] and history by [[W. B. Yeats]]. The Irish poet has asserted a significant influence on Thumboo, as Thumboo recognizes parallels between Ireland's nationalistic struggle and Singapore's breakaway from [[colonialism]]. He describes himself as a myth-inspired poet, and sees myths as ancient narratives and structures which provide a stable point of reference for a multicultural society.<ref name=Infopedia/> ''Ulysses'' has prompted other Singaporean poets such as [[Alfian Sa'at]], Vernon Chan, [[David Leo]],{{Fact|date=November 2008}} [[Felix Cheong]], Gwee Li Sui, [[Lee Tzu Pheng]], [[Alvin Pang]] and [[Daren Shiau]] to write their own Merlion-themed verses; it is often joked that one cannot be regarded as a true Singapore poet until one has written a "Merlion poem".<ref name=ST/><ref name=STE/> A copy of ''Ulysses'' is installed on a plaque near the statue.

History also features strongly in Thumboo's poetry. He has said:

{{quote|... History enters my writing, as it ought to enter the writing of others, because of its importance in our lives. I go back to this point about the historical moments we occupy. As a former colony, a multi-racial one, created by the British, we need history for a sense of things; to re-inscribe ourselves; discover and, in certain areas, define ourselves as individuals, as groups in a multi-racial society. They give you a sense of their belonging, which also happens to be mine. They give you an inherited identity that you put together by being conscious of what you have absorbed, or taken. I live in Singapore; I have likes and dislikes, a set of interests, a set of values, a set of responsibilities and so on. History I see as fully inclusive, fully in terms of one's personal limits. And it includes beliefs, and anything of significance ... nothing is irrelevant.<ref name=Infopedia/>}}

In August 2008, ''[[The Straits Times]]'' said that Thumboo's "most powerful legacy" was "spearheading the creation of a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you had the feeling that you had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it."<ref name=ST/> He compiled and edited some of the first [[anthology|anthologies]] of English poetry from Singapore and [[Malaysia]], including ''The Flowering Tree'' (1970), ''Seven Poets'' (1973) and ''The Second Tongue'' (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled ''The Poetry of Singapore'' (1985) and ''The Fiction of Singapore'' (1990).<ref name=STE/> In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called ''Child's Delight'' (1972), and another collection called ''Friend: Poems'' (2003).<ref name=CFA/> ''Still Travelling'', an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.<ref name=ST/>

On [[29 October]] [[2001]], at the launch of a book entitled ''Ariels: Departures and Returns <U+2013> Essays for Edwin Thumboo'' at the [[Singapore Art Museum]], Associate Professor Robbie Goh said:

{{quote|... Edwin Thumboo<U+2019>s dual discourses <U+2013> the analytical and theoretical discourse of the scholar, and the emotive and associative discourse of the poet <U+2013> enable him to capture the flow of our experience, and to present it in a variety of different ways, accessible to a variety of individuals. ...

I've come to see that Edwin Thumboo writes incessantly, because he is driven to communicate something of a better world; he rolls his sleeves up to act, because he is impatient with waiting for this world to change; and he forges friendships, because these represent the hope for a better world even within this imperfect one. His impact cannot be measured by words alone, but words <U+2013> the tools of his own trade <U+2013> may capture the "covenant" of his ideas and values.<ref name=CFA/>}}

==Awards==
Thumboo has won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Book Awards for Poetry three times, in 1978 for ''Gods Can Die'' (1977), in 1980 for ''Ulysses by the Merlion'' (1979), and again in 1994 for ''A Third Map'' (1993).<ref name=NLB/> He also received the inaugural [[S.E.A. Write Award]] in 1979, the first [[Cultural Medallion|Cultural Medallion for Literature]] in 1980, and the ASEAN Cultural and Communication Award (Literature) in 1987.<ref name=STE/> In October 2002, he presented the keynote address at the biennial meeting of the International Association of World Englishes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. There, he was presented with the [[Raja Rao|Raja Rao Award]] for his contributions to the literature of the [[Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin|Indian diaspora]].<ref name=CFA/>

Thumboo was conferred a ''[[Bintang Bakti Masyarakat]]'' (Public Service Star) in 1981 with an additional Bar in 1991,<ref name=CFA/> and the ''[[Pingat Jasa Gemilang]]'' (Meritorious Services Medal) as Distinguished Poet and Literary Scholar in 2006.<ref name=NLB/><ref name=STE/>
