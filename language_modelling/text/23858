'''Paul Citroen''' ([[15 Dec]] [[1896]] - [[13 March]] [[1983]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Holland|Dutch]] artist, best known for his photo-montage Metropolis (which influenced [[Fritz Lang]] to make his classic film [[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]] in [[1926]]) and the [[1949]] Dutch postage stamps.

==Early life and works==

Citroen was born and grew up in a middle-class family in [[Berlin]]. His father owned a fur shop. At an early age, Citroen began drawing, provoking strong support from his parents. He soon started to experiment with photography with [[Erwin Blumenfeld]] and studied art in Berlin.

In 1917 Citroen began studying at the [[Bauhaus]], where he started taking lessons from [[Paul Klee]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] (part of [[Der Blaue Reiter]]) and [[Johannes Itten]], who became one of his biggest influences. Around this time, he started Metropolis ([[1923]]), which became his best known piece. Between [[1929]] and [[1935]], he made many [[photograph]]s, clearly influenced by his work with Blumenfeld.

==Later life==
He soon started up the Nieuwe Kunstschool (New Art School) with [[Charles Roelofsz]]. It ran out of money and closed down in [[1937]]. That year, Citroen became a [[scholar]] at the Art Academy in The Hague. He stopped in [[1960]] and started painting portraits as his main focus. He painted portraits of famous Dutch people, including a well-known portrait of [[Liesbeth List]] in [[1979]].

He died in [[1983]] in [[Wassenaar]], [[Holland]].
