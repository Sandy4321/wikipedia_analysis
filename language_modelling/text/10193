'''Ashford''' is a town in the county of [[Kent]], [[England]]. It lies on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Great Stour]] at the south edge of the [[North Downs]]. The name comes from the [[Old English]] ''<U+00E6>scet'', indicating a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] near a [[Clumping (biology)|clump]] of [[ash tree]]s. It has been a market town since the 13th century, and its agricultural market is one of the most significant in the country.

Ashford has been an important communications hub and has stood at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became an important source of employment and contributed to the town's growth. With the opening of the [[Ashford International railway station|international passenger station]] it is now an key European communications centre, with new lines running between [[London]] and the [[Channel Tunnel]] (via [[High Speed 1]]). The [[M20 motorway (England)|M20 motorway]] also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.

The town has been marked as a significant place for expansion since the 1960s and appeared on several Government plans for growth. This has resulted in many changes, including the [[County Square]] shopping centre, the redevelopment of the Templar Barracks at Repton Park, and the award winning [[Ashford Designer Outlet]]. In the 1970s, a controversial Ringway scheme and construction of the multi storey Charter House building destroyed significant parts of the old town, though some areas were spared and preserved.

St Mary's Church in Ashford has been a significant local landmark since the 13th century, and expanded in the 15th. Today, the church functions in a dual role as a centre for worship and entertainment. A grammar school was founded here in the 17th century, which is now part of [[Norton Knatchbull School]].

==History==

===Early developments===
There has been evidence of human habitation around Ashford since the [[iron age]], with a barrow on what is now Barrow Hill dating back to 1500BC.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=6,10}} During [[Roman Britain]], iron ore was mined in the Weald and transported to Ashford where two ironworks processed the ore into a workable metal.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=13}} Archaeological studies have revealed the existence of a Roman town to the north of the current centre, roughly at the junction of Albert Road and Wall Road.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=11}}

The present town originates from an original settlement established in 893 AD by inhabitants escaping a Danish Viking raid, who were granted land by a Saxon Lord for their resistance.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.kent-life.co.uk/out-about/places/ashford_in_the_spotlight_1_1641103|title=Ashford in the spotlight|work=Kent Life|date=14 December 2010|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The name comes from the [[Old English]] ''<U+00E6>scet'', indicating a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]] near a [[Clumping (biology)|clump]] of [[ash tree]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ancestry.co.uk/name-origin?surname=ashford|title=Dictionary of American Family names|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> It is listed in the [[Domesday Book]], compiled in 1086, as having a church, two mills and a value of 150 [[shilling]]s (<U+00A3>7.50), under its original [[Old English language|Saxon]] name of ''Essetesford'' (or ''Eshetisford'', ''Esselesford'', ''Asshatisforde'', ''Essheford'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Ashford|title=Ashford|year=1911|publisher=Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place Names|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Mills|page=20|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-960908-6}}</ref> The manor was owned by Hugh de Montford, Constable of England at the time.<ref name="bho">{{cite book|title='The town and parish of Ashford' - The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent|volume=7|year=1798|pp=526<U+2013>545|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63440|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> One of the earliest houses in the area still in existence is Lake House at [[Eastwell Park]] to the north of the town, which contains the grave of [[Richard Plantagenet (Richard of Eastwell)|Richard Plantagenet]].{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=16}}

===Middle ages===
[[File:St Mary's Church, Ashford, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 809020.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Church, Ashford, dates from the 13th century, but was extensively modified in the 15th by [[John Fogge]]]]
Ashford's importance as an agricultural and market town grew in the 13th century. In 1243, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted the town a charter to hold a market for livestock. By the 1780s, local farmers had begun to hold informal market days, and advertised the town's ideal location between London, Chatham and the Kent Coast.<ref name="hobbesparker">{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbsparker.co.uk/CF/index.cfm?BulletinId=30&CFID=78842887&CFTOKEN=ae12456c4ea91223-E615926A-9E4C-AB2F-AFF8AFFB8FC0CC25|title=Ashford Cattle Market Company Limited|publisher=Hobbes Parker|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> The market was held in the High Street until 1856 when local farmers and businessmen relocated to Elwick Road and formed a market company that is the oldest surviving registered company in England and Wales.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=66}} There is still a regular street market in the town, although the market company has had to be relocated outside of the town due to part of the 19th century site being demolished to make way for the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]]. It is still used by around 5,000 farmers.<ref name="hobbesparker"/>

Ashford had a significant pottery trade during the 13th and 14th centuries, with the main works based at what is now Potter's Corner, a few miles west of the town centre. Later evidence from examining waste suggests that production was on a large scale.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=20}}

Parts of the parish church date from the 13th century, including a brass of the first rector, Robert de Derby.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=16}} [[John Fogge]] supervised substantial changes to the church in the late 15th century, including creating the {{convert|120|ft|m}} tower and raising the roof.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=33}}{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=25}} He was buried in the church and a memorial window is dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Herbert L.|year=1859|title=Notes of Brasses, Memorial Windows and Escutcheons Formerly Existing in Ashford and Willesborough Churches|journal=Archaeologia Cantiana|publisher=Kent Archaeological Society|volume=II|url=http://archive.org/stream/archaeologiacan03socigoog#page/n199/mode/2up/ |accessdate=24 September 2013|pages=106}}</ref> In the 17th century, a free [[grammar school]] was founded here; it was built on the churchyard's west side, and remained there until 1846, now used as a museum.{{sfn|Ruderman|1994|p=44}}

[[Jack Cade]], who led the Cade's Rebellion against corrupt Royal officials in 1450, is believed to be from Ashford.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=21}} In [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Henry VI, part 2]], Cade is shown conversing with "Dick, the Butcher from Ashford". Dick looks forward to removing officialdom after the rebeliion, saying "first thing, let's kill all the lawyers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.william-shakespeare.info/act4-script-text-henry-vi-part2.htm|title=Henry VI Part 2, Act 4|first=William|last=Shakespeare|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Ashford became known for [[nonconformism]]. A local resident, John Brown was executed for heresy in 1511, and may have inspired the later namesake of the song "[[John Brown's Body]]".{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=30}} [[Thomas Smythe (died 1591)|Thomas Smythe]] acquired the manor of Ashford as dowry from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in the mid 16th century and is buried in the parish church.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=31}}

===Modern developments===

The Army first established a presence in Ashford in 1797 when it built a garrison on Barrow Hill, and storerooms along what is now Magazine Road.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=49}} The military presence was scaled back during the 19th century, though the town was still considered strategically important in the event of an invasion.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=51}} The [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] established a presence in Ashford in 1910.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=75}} During [[World War I]], Ashford's importance as a transport hub and its location between the continent and London made it a target for [[aerial bombing of cities|aerial bombing]]. On 25 March 1917, a bomb targeted for the railway works fell on the town, killing 61 people.{{sfn|Ingleton|2012|p=160-161}} The town was targeted again during the [[Battle of Britain]] in [[World War II]].{{sfn|Ingleton|2012|p=170}} The [[Joint Services School of Intelligence]] was based at Templar Barracks in Ashford, until the barracks were decommissioned in 1997 and then demolished to make way for High Speed 1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/orgs/icsa/Old/jolly-stag.html|title=Jolly Stag|publisher=Kings College, London|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> [[Robert Runcie]], later to become the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was stationed at Ashford during the war.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=85}} In 1982, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] attended a course at Templar while he was stationed in the Royal Navy.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Little Book of Kent|first=Alex|last=Tulloch|publisher=The History Press|page=84|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7509-5397-9}}</ref> The site was sold to developers in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/2003/mar/25/land-sales-ashford#S6CV0402P0_20030325_CWA_162|title=Land Sales (Ashford)|first=Lewis|last=Moonie|work=Hansard|date=25 March 2003|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> though Repton Manor House remains as it is a Grade II listed buildling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-478350-repton-manor-templar-barracks-kent/comments|title=Report Manor, Templar Barracks, Kent|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

During the early and mid 20th century, print and media became a noted industry in Ashford. The Headley Brothers, a printing services company, was founded in 1881<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.headley.co.uk|title=Headley Brothers|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> and by the mid-1950s were printing and exporting over 2 million books.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=39}} The [[Letraset]] company set up an arts material factory in Ashford in the 1960s.

[[File:East Hill Mill, Ashford.JPG|thumb|right|[[H.S. Pledge & Sons Ltd]]'s flour mill on East Hill in 1982. By this time the mill had closed and was then a restaurant.]]
Food production has been an important industry in Ashford since the end of the 19th century. [[H.S. Pledge & Sons Ltd]] built two [[mill (grinding)|flour mills]] in Ashford, and became an important employer in the town. The first opened on Victoria Road in 1890{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=111}} while the second opened on East Hill in 1901. The mills closed in 1972 and were both partially destroyed by subsequent fires. The East Hill Mill fire occurred in 1974, but the main six storey tower block survived. The building is currently being used as a nightclub.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=42}} The Victoria Mills were almost completely destroyed by a fire in September 1984, and the remainder of the building had to be demolished.{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=111}} The soup manufacturer [[Batchelors]] became a significant employer in Ashford when they opened a <U+00A3>2.5m factory in Willesborough, east of the town centre, in 1957. A substantial proportion of Batchelors staff moved from their main production unit in [[Sheffield]] to Ashford.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=127}} The factory is now owned by [[Premier Foods]], who bought out Batchelors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/batchelors-parent-firm-to-slash--a68005/|title=Batchelors Parent Firm to Slash 600 jobs|first=James|last=Scott|date=30 December 2011|accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> Proprietary Perfumes opened a cosmetics factory and research laboratory next door to the Batchelors factory in 1962. It was subsequently sold to Quest International in the 1980s.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=128}} The wholesale frozen food firm Brake Brothers was established in 1957. Initially based at nearby [[Lenham]], it later moved to Ashford and expanded. The current European headquarters are based in Eureka Park to the north of the town.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=96}}

[[File:Designer Outlet Village, Kimberley Way, Ashford, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 911506.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ashford Designer Outlet]] was designed by [[Richard Rogers]] and attracts around 3 million customers a year.]]
Essentially a modern town, little is left of the old Ashford town centre, apart from a cluster of medieval [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] buildings in Middle Row and around the churchyard in the town centre. A number of old buildings were removed to make way for the controversial ring road around the centre, including four public houses.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=90}} Further demolition was required to build Charter House, an eight-story office building for the insurance company Charter Consolidated, that opened in 1975.{{sfn|Salter|2005|pp=101-102}} Charter subsequently moved back to London in 1985,{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=101}} and the building is now being converted into flats. Charter compensated for the demolition by funding a restoration scheme on North Street, preserving several historic buildings.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=103}}

Three modern shopping centres are located in the town. Park Mall opened in 1985 on the former Folkestone Glass Works site.{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=19}} The town's main shopping centre is [[County Square]], which was built over Hempsted Street, opening in 1973 as the Tufton Centre.{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=73}} In 1989, the centre was renamed to County Square and refurbished by CIN Properties, who added a glass roof.{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=87}} In 2008, the centre was expanded to include 50,000 sq ft of new retail space<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20111220052538/http://www.countysquareshoppingcentre.com/about-us/history/|title=History of County Square|publisher=County Square Shopping Centre|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> including a [[Debenhams]] store.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/debenhams-boss-denies-closure-ru-a48028/|title=Debenhams boss denies closure|work=Kent Messenger|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> Outside of the town centre is the [[Ashford Designer Outlet]] designed by [[Richard Rogers]],{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=113}} which attracts around 3 million customers a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washroomadvertising.co.uk/pdf/AshfordIntro.pdf|title=Ashford Designer Outlet|publisher=Washroom Advertising|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> The centre has won industry awards for Retail Destination of the Year and Best Shopping Venue<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent-business/county-news/ashford-blazes-trail-for-designe-a9082/|title=Ashford blazes trail for designer outlets|work=Kent Messenger|date=30 June 2003|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> and has been praised by the British Parking Association for its range of facilities, cleanliness and lack of crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishparking.co.uk/Park-Mark-Awards-and-latest-news/ashford-designer-outlet|title=Ashford Designer Outlet|publisher=British Parking Association|date=18 June 2013|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> A [[Waitrose]] store opened in November 2009 on the former Templar Barracks site,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/waitrose-confirms-it-is-coming-t-a51309/|title=Waitrose confirms it is coming to Ashford|work=Kent Messenger|date=6 March 2009|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> followed by a [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] store in November 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/excitement-all-around-as-new-8530/|title=The opening of the new John Lewis at home store, in Fougeres Way, Ashford has created 'gridlock' at the Drovers roundabout|first=Samantha|last=Williams|work=Kent Messenger|date=7 November 2013|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
Ashford lies at the intersection of two valleys in Kent <U+2013> the south edge of the [[North Downs]] and the valley of the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]], at the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the [[River Stour, Kent|Great Stour]] and [[East Stour, Kent|East Stour]] rivers. This made it an ideal place for a settlement.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=10}} The [[Ashford (borough)|Borough of Ashford]] lies on the eastern edge of the ancient forest of "Andredsweald" or "Anderida". This originally stretched as far west as [[Hampshire]] and formed the basis from which the [[Weald]] is formed.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=12}}

The original town of Ashford, in common with most such towns, has outgrown its original size and has combined with smaller villages in a [[conurbation]]. These villages include [[Bockhanger]], [[Kennington, Kent|Kennington]], [[Sevington]], [[Singleton, Kent|Singleton]] and [[Willesborough]]. In addition, housing estates have been built in the open spaces amongst Bybrook, [[Godinton]], [[Kingsnorth]], [[Park Farm, Kent|Park Farm]] and [[Stanhope, Kent|Stanhope]].<ref name="map"/>

In 1727, an underground fire was reported in nearby Hinxhill, while a larger [[earthquake]] struck the town on 1 June 1756.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=43}} The [[2007 Kent earthquake]], which registered 4.3 on the [[Richter scale]], was felt in Ashford, though its effects were greatest in [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6603169.stm|title=Q & A - Kent earthquake|work=BBC News|date=29 April 2007|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>

===Climate===
Ashford gets around {{convert|750|mm|in}} of rain a year, though the town generally has less rainfall than areas closer to the [[North Downs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashfordbestplaced.co.uk/PDF/Water%20for%20Ashford.pdf|title=Water for Ashford|publisher=Ashford Best Placed|accessdate=23 May 2014}}</ref> The area around the Stour, and particularly south of the station is prone to flooding, which means it has been generally uninhabited. Recent development has been possible by putting foundations on concrete stilts.{{sfn|Salter|2006|p=148}}

[[File:Ashford Population.jpg|thumb|right|The population growth of the [[Ashford (borough)|Ashford]] [[Borough]]]]
Ashford has been targeted as a key area for population development since the 1960s. In 1959, the [[London County Council]] negotiated 5000 new homes to be built in Ashford as overspill from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington.{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=95}} The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth.{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=4}} In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England.

===Road===
In Roman Britain, what is now Ashford was the meeting point of two main roads. One led from London to [[Lympne]] (''Lemanis''), the other from the Weald, through [[Canterbury]] (''Durovernum'') and ending at the port of [[Richborough]] (''Rutupiae'').{{sfn|Lawrie|2004|p=11}} Ashford was one of the towns in Kent to become a hub when the roads were [[toll road|turnpiked]] in the second half of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rural Landscape of Kent|first=S.G.|last=McRae|first2=C.P|last2=Burnham|publisher=Wye College|year=1973}}</ref> Those roads later became the [[A20 road (England)|A20]] from London to the [[English Channel|Channel]] ports; and the [[A28 road|A28]] which runs from [[Margate]], through [[Canterbury]] onto [[Tenterden]] and [[Hastings]].

Ashford's first bypass was opened on 19 July 1957 by the then [[Minister of Transport]], [[Harold Watkinson]].{{sfn|Salter|2005|p=140}} The main road through Ashford is now the [[M20 motorway (England)|M20]], which opened in stages between 1981 and 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciht.org.uk/motorway/m20londfolk.htm|title=M20 London - Folkestone|publisher=Chartered Institute of Highway Engineers|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> Junctions 9 and 10 serve the town.

The Ashford Ring Road was completed in November 1974 around the town centre in an attempt to relieve congestion along the previous main thoroughfare in the town centre, the narrow East Hill, though part of it involved widening existing streets and removing residential properties{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=5}} and demolishing part of the old market.{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=52}} The ring road initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, after 30 years as a one way system, at a total cost of <U+00A3>14m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/ashford/news/towns-ring-road-costs-soar-to--a32746/|title=Town's ring road costs soar to <U+00A3>14m|work=Kent Messenger|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref> The aim of this scheme was to allow the town centre to expand and accommodate an increasing population.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/5060564.stm|title=Plan for <U+00A3>10m ring road makeover|work=BBC News|date=9 June 2006|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="kent.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.kent.gov.uk/transport-and-streets/transport-and-road-planning/major-projects/ashford-ring-road.htm|title=Ashford Ring Road|publisher=Kent County Council}}</ref> The two-way route incorporates the first [[shared space]] scheme in the country.{{sfn|Salter|2012|p=52}} An art installation, Lost O, curated by the artist Michael Pinsky, was developed as part of the ring road's redevelopment but confused drivers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6285594.stm|title=Road sign art 'confusing drivers'|work=BBC News|date=9 July 2007|accessdate= 10 May 2014}}</ref>

[[Operation Stack]] is a traffic management system on the M20, including the section which runs through the town, which allows up to 3000 HGVs to queue for the [[Channel Tunnel]] and the [[Port of Dover]] on the motorway, in the event of bad weather or industrial action. The scheme is controversial as it involves closing the entire eastbound motorway to through traffic, and various alternatives have been proposed. In 2013, Kent County Council sought funding to build a dedicated lorry park in Ashford, that would alleviate the need for Operation Stack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monserat-properties.co.uk/operation-stack.html|title=Operation Stack|publisher=Monserat Properties|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref>

==Twin towns <U+2013> Sister cities==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in the United Kingdom}}
Ashford is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:
*{{flagicon|GER}} '''[[Bad M<U+00FC>nstereifel]]''' in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]], (population 19,007), twinned since 26 August 1964.<ref name="kn_twinning"/><ref name="twins">{{cite news|url=http://www.folkestoneherald.co.uk/Feature-twinning-towns-binding-communities/story-19261122-detail/story.html|title=twinning towns, binding communities|work=Folkestone Herald|date=12 June 2013|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>

*{{flagicon|USA}} '''[[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]],''' [[Virginia]], [[USA]], (population 22,354), twinned since 16 April 1994.<ref name="kn_twinning"/>

The association between Ashford and Bad M<U+00FC>nstereifel originates from the British occupation of the town in 1919 under the command of Major J Goode, following the end of [[World War I]]. John Wiles, brother in law of Major Goode, later became mayor of [[New Romney]] in 1946, and subsequently arranged a visit to the Rhineland with [[Winston Churchill]]. Wiles was declared an honorary citizen of Bad M<U+00FC>nstereifel in 1961, which led to the formal twinning.<ref name="kn_twinning">{{cite news|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/leisure/twin_towns_ties_run_far_deeper_than_50th_anniversary_suggest_1_2947434|title=Twin towns' ties run far deeper than 50th anniversary suggest|work=Kent News|date=31 October 2013|accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref>
