The '''California Condor''' (''Gymnogyps californianus'') is a North American [[species]] of [[bird]] in the [[New World vulture]] family [[Cathartidae]] and the largest North American land bird. Currently, this [[condor]] inhabits only the [[Grand Canyon]] area, [[Zion National Park]], and western coastal mountains of California and northern [[Baja California]]. Although other [[#Evolutionary history|fossil members are known]], it is the only surviving member of the [[genus]] ''Gymnogyps''.

It is a large, black [[vulture]] with patches of white on the underside of the wings and a largely bald head with skin color ranging from yellowish to a bright red, depending on the bird's mood. It has the largest [[wingspan]] of any bird found in North America and is one of the heaviest. The condor is a [[scavenger]] and eats large amounts of [[carrion]]. It is one of the world's [[List of long-living organisms|longest-living]] birds, with a lifespan of up to 50 years.

Condor numbers dramatically declined in the 20th century due to [[poaching]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[habitat destruction]]. Eventually, a [[conservation movement|conservation]] plan was put in place by the United States government that led to the capture of all 22 remaining wild condors in 1987. These surviving birds were bred at the [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]] and the [[Los Angeles Zoo]]. Numbers rose through [[captive breeding]] and, beginning in 1991, condors have been reintroduced into the wild. The project is the most expensive species conservation project ever undertaken in the United States. The California Condor is one of the world's rarest bird species. As of November 2010, there are 381 condors known to be living, including 192 in the wild.<ref name="SDPop">{{cite web| title= San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: California Condor| publisher=The Zoological Society of San Diego's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species| url = http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-condor.html| accessdate= 2010-11-15 }}</ref>

The condor is a significant bird to many Californian Native American groups and plays an important role in several of their [[Native American mythology|traditional myths]].

==Taxonomy==
The California Condor was described by English naturalist [[George Shaw]] in 1797 as ''Vultur californianus''. It was originally classified in the same genus as the [[Andean Condor]] (''V. gryphus''), but, due to the Andean Condor's slightly different markings, slightly longer wings, and tendency to kill small animals to eat,<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 27</ref> the California Condor has now been placed in its own [[monotypic taxon|monotypic genus]]. The generic name ''Gymnogyps'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''gymnos''/<U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2> "naked" or "bare", and ''gyps''/<U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03C8> "vulture",<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author=[[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> while the specific name ''californianus'' comes from its location in California.

The exact [[taxonomic]] placement of the California Condor and the remaining six species of [[New World vulture]]s remains unclear.<ref name="SACC"/> Though both are similar in appearance and have similar [[Ecological niche|ecological roles]], the New World and [[Old World vulture]]s evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world.

===Evolutionary history===
[[Image:Gymnogyps amplus fossil.jpg|thumb|upright|Fossil of the extinct species ''Gymnogyps amplus'' from the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]]] 
The [[genus]] ''Gymnogyps'' is a prime example of a [[relict]] distribution. During the [[Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], this genus was widespread across the [[Americas]]. From fossils, the Floridan ''Gymnogyps kofordi'' from the [[Early Pleistocene]] and the [[Peru]]vian ''Gymnogyps howardae'' from the [[Late Pleistocene]] have been described.<ref name="CornellBNA">{{cite web | title = The Birds of North America Online: California Condor| year = 2003 | publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology | url = http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/BNA/account/California_Condor/SYSTEMATICS.html| accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref> A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on [[Cuba]] was initially described as ''Antillovultur varonai'', but has since been recognized as another member of ''Gymnogyps''. It may even have been a subspecies of the California Condor.<ref name="CornellBNA"/>

Today's California Condor is the sole surviving member of ''Gymnogyps'' and has no accepted subspecies; although its range greatly contracted during the [[Holocene]], the species always had a small and inbred population. However, there is a Late Pleistocene [[chronospecies|palaeosubspecies]], ''Gymnogyps californianus amplus'', which occurred over much of the bird's historical range <U+2013> even extending into Florida <U+2013> but was larger, having about the same weight as the [[Andean Condor]]. This bird also had a wider bill.<ref>Fisher, Harvey L. (1944): The skulls of the Cathartid vultures. ''[[Condor (journal)|Condor]]'' '''46'''(6): 272<U+2013>296.

==Description==
[[File:California-Condor3-Szmurlo edit.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Upper body]]
The adult California Condor is a uniform black, with the exception, especially in the male, of large triangular patches or bands of white on the underside of the [[Bird flight#Wing|wing]]s. It has gray legs and feet, an ivory-colored bill, a frill of black [[feather]]s nearly surrounding the base of the neck, and brownish red eyes.<ref name="Cornell">{{cite web | title = All About Birds: California Condor| year = 2003 | publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology | url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/California_Condor_dtl.html| accessdate = 2007-08-22}}</ref> The juvenile is mostly a mottled dark brown with blackish coloration on the head. It has mottled gray instead of white on the underside of its [[flight feather]]s.<ref name="BirdLife">BirdLife International (2007) Species factsheet: Gymnogyps californianus. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 17 August '2007</ref>

As an adaptation for hygiene, the condor's head and neck have few feathers, which exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of [[dehydration]] and solar [[ultraviolet light]] at high altitudes. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals.<ref name="CoolFacts">{{cite web | title = California Condors Cool Facts  | publisher=Ventana Wildlife Society |  url = http://www.ventanaws.org/species_condors_coolfacts/| accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange.<ref name="Cornell"/>

Contrary to the usual rule among true [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], the female is smaller than the male. Overall length can range from {{convert|109|-|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the wingspan is {{convert|2.90|m|ft|abbr=on}} or higher.<ref name="BirdLife"/> Their weight can range from {{convert|7|-|14|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with estimations of average weight ranging from {{convert|8|-|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Most measurements are from birds raised in captivity, so determining if there are any major differences in measurements between wild and captive condors is difficult.
[[Image:California-condor.jpg|thumb|Juvenile]]
California Condors have the largest wingspan of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the [[Trumpeter Swan]] and the introduced [[Mute Swan]]. The [[American White Pelican]] and [[Whooping Crane]] also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large that they can be mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 1</ref>

The middle toe of the California Condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only slightly developed. The [[claw|talons]] of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the [[stork]]s<ref>Cracraft, J., F. K.

==Historic Range==
[[Image:Sonomamtneflank.jpg|thumb|right|California Oak savanna on the east flank of [[Sonoma Mountain]]]]
At the time of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|human settlement of the Americas]], the California Condor was widespread across North America. However, climate changes associated with the end of the [[last glacial period]] and the [[Quaternary extinction event|extinction]] of the [[Pleistocene megafauna]] led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California Condor roamed across the [[American Southwest]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in [[Arizona]],<ref>Miller, Loye (1960): Condor Remains from Rampart Cave, Arizona. ''[[Condor (journal)|Condor]]'' '''62'''(1): 70 [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v062n01/p0070-p0070.pdf PDF fulltext]</ref> [[Nevada]],<ref>Miller, Loye (1931): The California Condor in Nevada.

==Habitat==
The condors live in rocky [[scrubland]], [[coniferous forest]]s, and [[oak savanna]]s.<ref name="IUCN">{{cite web | title = Gymnogyps californianus| author=BirdLife International 2006| publisher=IUCN 2007| url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/9574/summ| accessdate = 2007-09-15| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070823044840/http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/details.php/9574/summ| archivedate = August 23, 2007}}</ref> They are often found near cliffs or large trees, which they use as nesting sites. Individual birds have a huge range and have been known to travel up to 250&nbsp;km (150&nbsp;mi) in search of [[carrion]].

There are two sanctuaries dedicated to this bird, the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary in the [[San Rafael Wilderness]]<ref>Gagnon, Dennis R.  ''Hiking the Santa Barbara Backcountry.''  The Ward Ritchie Press, Pasadena, California, 1974. ISBN 0378-03542-8</ref> and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. These areas were chosen because of their prime condor nesting habitat.

==Ecology and behavior==
[[Image:Condor in flight.JPG|thumb|upright|Adult in flight. Notice the tracking tags on both wings.]]
When in [[bird flight|flight]], the movements of the condor are remarkably graceful. The lack of a large [[sternum]] to anchor their correspondingly large flight muscles restricts them to being primarily soarers. The birds flap their wings when taking off from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation they largely glide, sometimes going for miles without a single flap of their wings. They have been known to fly up to speeds of 90&nbsp;km/h (55&nbsp;mph) and as high as 4,600 m (15,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name="USFW">{{cite web | title = California condor, (Gymnogyps californianus) | publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| url = http://www.fws.gov/species/species_accounts/bio_cond.html| accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> They prefer to roost on high perches from which they can launch without any major wing-flapping effort. Often, these birds are seen soaring near rock cliffs, using [[thermals]] to aid them in keeping aloft.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 79</ref>

The California Condor has a long life span, reaching up to 50 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans.<ref>{{cite web | title = San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: California Condor | publisher=Zoological Society of San Diego | url = http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-condor.html| accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> Their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses.<ref name="CoolFacts"/> Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers.<ref name="USFW"/> Condors also perform [[urohidrosis]], or defecate on their legs, to reduce their [[body temperature]].<ref name="CoolFacts"/> There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, and a variety of hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.<ref name="Behavior">{{cite web | title = California Condor Behavior| publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge | url = http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/condorbehavior.html| accessdate = 2007-08-22| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070416212803/http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/condorbehavior.html| archivedate = April 16, 2007}}</ref>

===Diet===
Wild condors inhabit large territories, often traveling {{convert|250|km|mi}} a day in search of [[carrion]].<ref name="Ventana">{{cite web | title = California Condor Life History| publisher=Ventana Wildlife Society | url = http://www.ventanaws.org/species_condors_history/| accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> It is thought that in the early days of its existence as a species, the California Condor lived off the carcasses of the "[[megafauna]]", which are now [[Quaternary extinction event|extinct]] in North America. They still prefer to feast on large, terrestrial [[mammal]]ian carcasses such as [[deer]], [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, pigs, [[cougar]]s, bears, or [[cattle]]. Alternatively, they may feed on the bodies of smaller mammals, such as [[rabbit]]s or [[coyote]]s, [[aquatic mammal]]s such as [[whale]]s and [[California Sea Lion]]s, or [[salmon]]. Bird and [[reptile]] carcasses are rarely eaten. Since they do not have a [[Olfaction|sense of smell]],<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 58</ref> they spot these corpses by looking for other scavengers, like smaller [[vulture]]s and [[eagle]]s, who cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with the efficiency of the larger condor. They can usually intimidate other scavengers away from the carcass, with the exception of bears, which will ignore them, and [[Golden Eagle]]s, which will fight a condor over a kill or a carcass.<ref name="Cornell"/> In the wild they are intermittent eaters, often going for between a few days to two weeks without eating,<ref name="Ventana"/> then gorging themselves on {{convert|1|<U+2013>|1.5|kg|lb}} of meat at once, sometimes to the point of being unable to lift themselves off the ground.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 30</ref>

===Reproduction===
[[File:Gymnogyps californianus -near Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge, California, USA -adult and chick-8 (1).jpg|thumb|right|An adult with a 30-day old chick in a cave nest near [[Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge]], California, USA]]
Condors begin to look for a mate when they reach sexual maturity at the age of six.<ref name="USFW"/> To attract a prospective mate, the male condor performs a display. In the display, the male turns his head red and puffs out his neck feathers. He then spreads his wings and slowly approaches the female. If the female lowers her head to accept the male, the condors become mates for life.<ref name="Behavior"/> The pair makes a simple nest in caves or on cliff clefts, especially ones with nearby roosting trees and open spaces for landing. A mated female lays one bluish-white [[egg (biology)|egg]] every other February or March. The egg weighs about 280&nbsp;g (10&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]) and measures from 90<U+2013>120&nbsp;mm (3.5<U+2013>4.75&nbsp;in.) in length and about 67&nbsp;mm (2.6&nbsp;in.) in width. If the chick or egg is lost or removed, the parents "double clutch", or lay another egg to take the lost one's place. Researchers and breeders take advantage of this behavior to double the reproductive rate by taking the first egg away for hand-rearing; this induces the parents to lay a second egg, which the condors are sometimes allowed to raise.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 186</ref>

The eggs hatch after 53 to 60&nbsp;days of [[Avian incubation|incubation]] by both parents. Chicks are born with their eyes open and sometimes can take up to a week to hatch from their egg.<ref name="CoolFacts"/> The young are covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after five to six months, but continue to roost and hunt with their parents until they turn two, at which point they are displaced by a new clutch.<ref name="Cornell"/>

===Current Status===
In modern times, a wide variety of causes have contributed to the condor's decline. Its exacting mating habits and resulting low birth rate, combined with a late age of sexual maturity, make the bird vulnerable to loss of population. Significant damage to the condor population is also attributed to [[poaching]], especially for museum specimens,<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 83</ref> [[lead poisoning]] (from eating animals containing lead shot),<ref name="Lead">{{cite news | title = Lead poisoning eyed as threat to California condor| first= John| last= Ritter| work=USA Today| url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-23-condor_x.htm|date = 2006-10-23|accessdate = 2009-04-03}}</ref> [[DDT]] poisoning,<ref>Kiff, L.

During the [[California Gold Rush]], some condors were even kept as pets.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 88</ref>

In addition to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding on the dead young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle. This fallacy led to the condor's extinction in some parts of the western United States. This belief was so deeply ingrained that the [[reintroduction]] of condors to the [[Grand Canyon]] was challenged by some cattle ranchers, who mistakenly believed that the bird hunted calves and lambs.<ref name="SheppardSoftware">{{cite web | title = Condors | first= Brad |last=Sheppard | publisher=Sheppard Software| url = http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/birds/condor.htm| accessdate = 2007-08-27}}</ref>

Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations occurred due to contact with [[Golden Eagle]]s, power lines, wind turbines and other factors such as [[lead poisoning]]. Since 1994, captive-bred California Condors have been trained to avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased.<ref>{{cite web | title = California Condor Recovery Program| publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge |  url = http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/recovery.html| month = December | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-09-13| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911194220/http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/recovery.html| archivedate = September 11, 2007}}</ref> Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices;<ref>Thacker, Paul D.

===California Condor Recovery Plan===
[[Image:Gymnogyps californianus1.jpg|thumb|upright|Condor chick being fed by condor feeding puppet]]
As the condor's population continued to decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding program for the birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors had the right to freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 13</ref> However, the project received the approval of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]], and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on [[Easter Sunday]] 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 24</ref> There were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity. 

The goal of the California Condor Recovery Plan was to establish two geographically separate populations, one in California and the other in Arizona, each with 150 birds and at least 15 breeding pairs. As the Recovery Program works toward this goal the number of release sites has grown. There are three active release sites in California, one in Arizona and one in Baja, Mexico.<ref name=USAToday> {{cite news |title=Condor population reaches 100 in California |author=Elizabeth Weise |newspaper=USA Today |date=2010-10-07 |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/10/california-california-condor-population-reaches-100/1 |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}</ref>

The captive breeding program, led by the [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]] and [[Los Angeles Zoo]], got off to a slow start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]], biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.

As the number of condors grew, attention began to focus on releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive [[Andean Condor]]s into the wild in California. Only females were released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean Condors were recaptured and re-released in South America.<ref name="USFW"/> California Condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.<ref name="BirdLife"/> Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers began increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.

The California Condor conservation project is the most expensive species conservation project in United States history,<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 7</ref> costing over $35&nbsp;million, including $20&nbsp;million in federal and state funding, since World War II.<ref>{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge|  url = http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/FAQ.html| accessdate = 2007-08-23| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808215527/http://www.fws.gov/hoppermountain/cacondor/FAQ.html| archivedate = August 8, 2007}}</ref> However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors.

As the Recovery Program achieved milestones a third active release site in [[Sierra de San Pedro M<U+00E1>rtir National Park]], Baja, Mexico, was added to the two release sites in California ([[Pinnacles National Monument]] and [[Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge]] and the [[Grand Canyon]] release site in Arizona.<ref> {{cite journal |title=Condors to take flight in Baja Sierras |publisher=UCMEXUS (University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States |date=Spring, 2003 |url=http://ucmexus.ucr.edu/publications/n40Sp03/condors.html |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}</ref> In early 2007, a California condor laid an egg in Mexico for the first time since at least the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news | title = California Condor lays egg in Mexico | author=Thomas Watkins|. http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-03-condor-egg_N.htm | date = 2007-04-03 |work=USA Today | accessdate = 2007-08-14}}</ref> The population of the condors has risen due to these wild and also captive nestings.

Throughout its historic range, the California Condor has been a popular subject of [[Native American mythology|mythology]] and an important symbol to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Unusually,<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 39</ref> this bird takes on different roles in the storytelling of the different tribes.
[[File:Calif condor skull.jpg|thumb|left|California condor skull]]

The [[Wiyot people|Wiyot]] tribe of California say that the condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped humanity out with a flood.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 37</ref> However, other tribes, like California's [[Mono tribe|Mono]], viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood so that it would flood [[Ground Squirrel]]'s home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 38</ref> According to the [[Yokut]] tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused [[eclipse]]s.<ref name="Nielsen40">Nielsen 2006, p. 40</ref> The [[Chumash people|Chumash]] tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew too close to a fire.<ref name="Nielsen40"/>

Condor bones have been found in Native American graves, as have condor feather [[war bonnet|headdresses]]. [[Cave painting]]s of condors have also been discovered.<ref>Nielsen 2006, p. 36</ref> Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. [[Shamanism|Shaman]]s then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed,<ref name="Nielsen41">Nielsen 2006, p. 41</ref> so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing helped contribute to the condor's decline.<ref name="Nielsen41"/> If so, this would be the only known species that was endangered by the California natives.<ref name="Nielsen41"/><div style="clear:both;"></div>
