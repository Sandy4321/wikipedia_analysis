'''Hurricane Fabian''' was a powerful [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] that hit [[Bermuda]] in early September during the [[2003 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Fabian, the sixth named storm, fourth hurricane, and first [[Tropical cyclone#Categories and ranking|major hurricane]] of the season, developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the tropical [[Atlantic Ocean]] on [[August 25]]. It moved west-northwestward under the influence of the [[subtropical ridge]] to its north, and steadily strengthened in an area of warm [[sea surface temperature|water temperatures]] and light [[wind shear]]. The hurricane attained a peak intensity of 145&nbsp;mph (230&nbsp;km/h) on [[September 1]], and it slowly weakened as it turned northward. On [[September 5]], Fabian made a direct hit on the island of [[Bermuda]] with wind speeds of over 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h). After passing the island, the hurricane turned to the northeast, and became [[extratropical]] on [[September 8]].

Fabian was the strongest hurricane to hit Bermuda since [[1963 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Arlene|Hurricane Arlene]] in 1963.<ref name="ncdc2003">{{cite web|author=National Climatic Data Center|year=2003|title=Global Hazards and Significant Events September 2003|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2003/sep/hazards.html}}</ref> It was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926.<ref name="mostdaming">{{cite web|author=PartnerRE Ltd.|year=2003|title=PartnerRe Weathers Hurricane Fabian|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2003/09/15/32288.htm}}</ref> The hurricane's powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing [[The Causeway, Bermuda|a causeway]] on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered [[Bermuda Petrel]] was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although volunteer work transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], and also caused four people to drown along the [[United States]]' [[Atlantic coast]]. In all, Fabian caused around $300&nbsp;million (2003&nbsp;USD, $330&nbsp;million 2006&nbsp;USD) in damage and eight deaths.

==Aftermath==
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricanes}}
Blocked roads initially caused delays to crews from the Bermuda Electric Light Company, which were attempting to restore power to the island. Of high priority among the places to be restored were the hospital, as well as hotels to accommodate tourists who remained on the island through the storm.<ref name="rgcauseway"/> By the second day after the storm passed the island, power was restored to 11,000&nbsp;residents.<ref name="body">{{cite web|author=Stephen Breen|year=2003|title=First body recovered|publisher=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030908/NEWS/109080018&SearchID=73260282488996}}</ref> Power on Bermuda was restored to all customers within three weeks of the hurricane, but the electricity supply distribution system was greatly weakened. This resulted in a rehabilitation plan implemented in October 2003. Days after the hurricane passed, moisture from [[Tropical Storm Henri (2003)|Tropical Storm Henri]] resulted in thunderstorms and heavy rainfall; this hindered recovery efforts, but did not cause any reported damage.<ref name="2003wmobr"/> Lack of power caused interruptions to communications and left islanders without knowledge. While an emergency broadcast station was installed and tested prior the hurricane, the hurricane caused a problem to the system's back-up generator.<ref name="rginfo">{{cite web|author=The Royal Gazette|year=2003|title=Communication Breakdown|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030906/NEWS/109060101&SearchID=73260153229021}}</ref>   [[The Causeway, Bermuda|The causeway]] in Bermuda remained closed for several days after the hurricane as road crews made temporary repairs.<ref name="yearend"/> Upon being opened three days after the storm,<ref name="body"/> traffic was limited to one lane each way. However, the causeway had to be closed in the event of rain, winds exceeding 30&nbsp;mph (48&nbsp;km/h), and at nighttime.<ref name="stormcarib"/> The bridge was fully repaired by early November, 2003.<ref name="yearend"/>

In the days after the storm, neighbors assisted each other, especially for elderly citizens.<ref name="shorts"/> Three days after the storm, for example, a radio station DJ announced a name for an elderly person in need, and within minutes a Bermuda citizen would call to provide for their needs.<ref name="stormcarib"/> Citizens cleared smaller roads from debris with [[chainsaw]]s,<ref name="shorts"/> which in turn helped the power companies to make repairs quickly.<ref name="rgcauseway"/> As a result of damage on their homes, dozens of people stayed in five shelters or undamaged hotels.<ref name="fabnp"/> Citizens purchased large quanities of gasoline in the days after Fabian, some of whom bought over $500&nbsp;worth (2003 USD). Officials assured there was no shortage, but requested drivers to conserve gas.<ref name="shoppers">{{cite web|author=Ayo Johnson|year=2003|title=Shoppers urged not to panic buy for essentials|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030908/NEWS/109080019&SearchID=73260282488996}}</ref> [[XL Capital Ltd.]] shipped 250 [[tarpaulin]]s, 10 [[electric generator]]s, and rope supply to the island.<ref name="body"/> The [[United Kingdom]] offered help to the island with two [[Royal Navy]] ships with vital supplies such as tents, dried foods, and blankets. [[List of Premiers of Bermuda|Premier]] [[William Alexander Scott|Alex Scott]] declined the offer, believing the island could withstand on its own. [[World Vision]] offered assistance with blankets, tents, and other supplies, while two [[United States]] companies offered to send generators. Bermuda Electric Light received aid from the Caribbean Electric Organization, which sent over 20 electricians to repair power lines.<ref name="aid">{{cite web|author=Dan Rutstein|year=2003|title=Premier turns down UK offer to help|publisher=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.theroyalgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030908/NEWS/109080020&SearchID=73260282488996}}</ref>

Initially, the time for the destroyed vegatation on Bermuda to regrow was estimated to take decades. To help, the South Carolina Maritime Heritage Foundation, with support from a local [[Boy Scouts (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scouts troop]] and local nurseries, delivered 1,000 [[Buxus|boxwood]] plants to the island.<ref name="plants"/> Following the damage to the [[Bermuda Petrel]]'s habitat, Bermuda<U+2019>s Department of Conservation organized a translocation program, which involved moving the habitat to [[Nonsuch Island]]. The new island was much higher and safer for the birds, and by two years after the hurricane the population numbers were higher than before the storm.<ref name="birdlife">{{cite web|author=Bird Life International|year=2005|title=Cahows bounce back as Bermudans build burrows|accessdate=2006-10-17|url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2005/09/cahow.html}}</ref>

Due to the damage and deaths on [[Bermuda]], the name Fabian was retired in the spring of 2004 and will never again be used for an [[Atlantic hurricane]]. As a result, the Bermuda Weather Service allowed residents to suggest a replacement name, with the only rule being the name had to be a male name beginning with the letter "F", able to be easily pronounced, and not currently in use. The service received a list of over 30 names, including Forrest, Felix, and Frodo, after [[Frodo Baggins|the character]] in [[Lord of the Rings]]. After sending a smaller list of three names,<ref name="retire">{{cite web|author=Sarah Titterson|year=2004|title=Fabian's out...
