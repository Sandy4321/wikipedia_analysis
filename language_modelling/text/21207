'''''Telopea speciosissima''''', commonly known as the '''New South Wales Waratah''' or simply '''Waratah''', is a large shrub in the [[Proteaceae]] family. It is endemic to [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] and is the [[floral emblem]] of that state. No subspecies are recognised, although the closely related ''[[Telopea aspera]]'' was only recently recognised as a separate species. It grows as a shrub to 3 or 4 m (10<U+2013>13&nbsp;ft) high and 2 m wide, with several stems rising from a pronounced woody base known as a lignotuber, and dark green leaves. It is most renowned for its striking large crimson [[inflorescence]]s (flowerheads) in spring, each made up of hundreds of individual flowers. These are visited by the [[Eastern Pygmy Possum]] (''Cercartetus nanus''), birds such as [[honeyeater]]s (Meliphagidae), and insects.

The floral emblem for its home state of [[New South Wales]], ''Telopea speciosissima'' has featured prominently in art, architecture and advertising, particularly since Federation. Commercially  grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in the home garden, although it requires good drainage, yet adequate moisture, and is vulnerable to fungal disease and pests. A number of cultivars with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. Plantsmen have also developed hybrids with ''[[Telopea oreades]]'' and ''T. mongaensis'', which are more tolerant of cold, shade and heavier soils.

==Description==
The New South Wales Waratah is a large erect shrub up to 3 or 4&nbsp;metres (10<U+2013>13&nbsp;ft) in height with one or more stems.<ref name=ANBG/><ref name=NSW>{{cite web|author=Crisp, Michael D.; Weston, Peter H.|title=''Telopea speciosissima'' (Sm.) R.Br.|work=New South Wales Flora Online|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> Arising vertically or near vertically from a large woody base, or lignotuber, the stems are little branched. There is a spurt of new growth after flowering in late spring, with new shoots often arising from old flowerheads.<ref name=Nixon27/><!-- cites both previous sentences --> The dark green leaves are alternate, usually coarsely-toothed and range from 13 to 25&nbsp;cm (5<U+2013>10&nbsp;in) in length.<ref name=ANBG/> Enveloped in leafy bracts, the flowerheads develop over the winter and begin to swell in early spring,<ref name=ANBG/><ref name=Nixon23>Nixon, p. 23.</ref> before opening to reveal the striking [[inflorescence]]s. The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas.<ref name=Nixon27>Nixon, p. 27.</ref> Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn.<ref name=Nixon24>Nixon, p. 24.</ref> Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure 7<U+2013>10&nbsp;cm (3<U+2013>4&nbsp;in) in diameter. They are cupped in a whorl of leafy bracts which are 5 to 7&nbsp;cm (2<U+2013>3&nbsp;in) long and also red in colour.<ref name=ANBG/><ref name=Nixon27/> Variations are not uncommon. Some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome-shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red. The tips of the stigmas of some inflorescences may be whitish in colour, contrasting with the red colour of the rest of the flowerhead.<ref name=Nixon25>Nixon, p. 25.</ref>

An individual flowerhead reaches full size around two weeks after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another two weeks before the flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the florets remain unopened<U+2014>and the flowerhead retains a compact shape<U+2014>before they mature and open, revealing the style and stigma. The outermost florets open first, anthesis progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects.<ref name=Nixon24/><!-- cites previous three sentences --> Flowering is followed by the development of seed pods that are 8<U+2013>15&nbsp;cm (3<U+2013>6&nbsp;in) long.<ref name=FOA>{{cite web|title=Telopea speciosissima|work=Flora of Australia online|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/online-resources/flora/stddisplay.xsql?pnid=2471|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> The pods eventually turn brown and leathery, splitting open to reveal the winged seeds  inside;<ref name=ANBG/> this generally occurs in early winter.<ref name=Nixon24/> In the wild, only 2 or 3 seed pods develop per flowerhead, but there may be anywhere from 5 to 50 in cultivation.<ref name=Nixon24/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Embothrium speciosissimum (Sowerby).jpg|thumb|Hand-coloured engraving by [[James Sowerby]] from ''A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland''. ]] The species is found from the [[Watagan Mountains]] southward to [[Ulladulla]], with a relatively widespread distribution in the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] region.<ref name=NSW/> It usually occurs as an understorey shrub in open forest on sandy soils in areas with moderately high rainfall.<ref name=ANBG/> Dappled shade from eucalyptus trees reduces sunlight to about 70% of full sun.<ref name=Nixon27/>

==Taxonomy==
The New South Wales Waratah was first described by botanist [[James Edward Smith]] in his 1793 ''[[A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland]]'', from "very fine dried specimens sent by [[John White (surgeon)|Mr. White]]".<ref name=APNI1>{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=Embothrium+speciosissimum|title=''Embothrium speciosissimum'' |accessdate=2010-02-14|work= [[Australian Plant Name Index]] (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra}}</ref> He gave the species its original binomial  name of ''Embothrium speciosissimum''.<ref name=APNI1/> The specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] word  ''speciosus'' meaning 'beautiful' or 'handsome'.<ref name=ANBG>{{cite web |author=Bowden Anne|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/nsw.emblem.html |title=Floral Emblem of New South Wales |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens}}</ref>

''Embothrium'' had been a [[wastebasket taxon]] at the time, and [[Robert Brown (botanist)|Robert Brown]] soon suggested the genus ''[[Telopea]]'' in 1809, which was published in 1810.<ref name=APNI2>{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=TELOPEA+SPECIOSISSIMA|title=''Telopea speciosissima'' |accessdate=2008-03-27|work= [[Australian Plant Name Index]] (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra}}</ref> [[Richard Anthony Salisbury|Richard Salisbury]] published the name ''Hylogyne speciosa'' in 1809, but Brown's name was [[conserved name|conserved]].<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/><!-- cites para -->

''Telopea speciosissima''  has no recognised subspecies, although forms toward the northern limits of its range have more prominently lobed leaves. Its closest relative is the very similar Gibraltar Range Waratah (''[[Telopea aspera|T. aspera]]'') from Northern New South Wales, which was only recognised as a separate species in 1995<U+2014>previously it was considered an unusual northern population. A further three species from southeastern Australia make up the genus ''[[Telopea]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crisp, Michael D.; Weston,Peter H.|year=1995|chapter=Telopea|editor=McCarthy, Patrick (ed.)|title=Flora of Australia: Volume 16: Eleagnaceae, Proteaceae 1|pages=386&ndash;390|publisher=CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study|isbn=0-643-05693-9}}</ref> <!-- cites both previous sentences  --> The genus lies in the subtribe Embothriinae, along with the tree waratahs (''[[Alloxylon]]'') from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and ''[[Oreocallis]]'' and Chilean firetree (''[[Embothrium coccineum]]'') from South America.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Johnson, Lawrie.

The common name of ''waratah'' was first applied to this species before being generalised to other members of the genus ''Telopea'' and, to a lesser extent, ''Alloxylon''. It is derived from the [[Eora]] Aboriginal people, the original inhabitants of the [[Sydney]] area. ''Mewah'' is another aboriginal name.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> Former common names include native tulip, from around 1900, possibly derived from ''Telopea''.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/>

==Ecology==
''Telopea speciosissima'' is a [[pyrogenic flowering]] species, relying on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment. It is one of the slowest resprouting woody plant species in south-eastern Australia to produce seedlings after [[bushfire|fire]].<ref name = Denham>{{cite journal |last=Denham |first=Andrew J. |coauthors=Auld, Tony D. |year=2002 |title=Flowering, seed dispersal, seed predation and seedling recruitment in two pyrogenic flowering resprouters |journal=Australian Journal of Botany |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages= 545<U+2013>57}}</ref><!-- cites para --> The lignotuber is a swollen woody base which is largely under the soil. Storing energy and nutrients, it is the source of rapid new shoots after bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias and wattles. Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests.<ref name=Nixon256>Nixon, pp. 25-26. </ref>

The prominent position and striking colour of ''Telopea speciosissima'' and many of its relatives within the subtribe [[Embothriinae]] both in Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years.<ref name=Nixon19>Nixon, p. 19.</ref> Honeyeaters, in particular the [[New Holland Honeyeater]] (''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'')<ref name="affpoll"/>  and [[Crescent Honeyeater]] (''P. pyrrhopterus'')<ref name=Nixonp3>Nixon, plate 3.</ref> are frequent visitors. However, a field study conducted at Barren Grounds showed New Holland Honeyeaters to be carrying relatively little pollen. The [[Eastern Pygmy Possum]] (''Cercartetus nanus'') also forages among the flowerheads.<ref name="affpoll">{{cite web|url=http://www.aff.org.au/Whelan_waratah_final.pdf|title=Pollination in Waratah|last=Whelan, Robert J.; Goldingay, Ross L. |date=July 1989|work=Australian Flora Foundation website|publisher=Australian Flora Foundation|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref>

==Cultivation==
[[File:Telopea speciosissima suellen.JPG|thumb|right|Flowerhead of cultivated plant growing in the [[South Coast, New South Wales|South Coast]] region of New South Wales]]
The New South Wales  waratah was a popular garden plant at the beginning of the 20th century. It had been introduced early (1789) into the United Kingdom, and was reported flowering for the first time in 1809 at Springwell, the villa of one E. J. A. Woodford Esq.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> The Royal Horticultural Society awarded it an Award of Merit in 1914, and a First Class Certificate in 1922.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/>

Initially, waratahs were picked from the bushland for market, but by the early 20th century, a few plantsmen grew concerned at the  development of urban areas at the expense of bush, particularly areas noted for wildflowers. Percy Parry of Floralands in [[Kariong, New South Wales|Kariong]] developed the idea of "Preservation by Cultivation" and investigated the commercial cultivation of waratahs and other native plants. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Government was looking to curb flower and plant collecting from the wild, and considered prohibition in 1944, but after witnessing the ability of Parry to manage and develop cultivation, introduced compulsory licences for wildflower collecting the following year. With his wife Olive, Percy promoted and developed knowledge over fifty years and received the Order of Australia medal in 1981.<ref name=Nixon41>Nixon, p. 41. </ref> Following on from the Parrys were Howard Gay and Arch Dennis, who pioneered growing waratahs at Monbulk in the [[Dandenong Ranges]] in the 1940s, Sid Cadwell and Frank Stone.<ref name=Nixon42>Nixon, p. 42. </ref> The growing movement for cultivating and preserving native plants saw the establishment of the [[Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)|Society for Growing Australian Plants]] in 1957,<ref name=Nixon42/> and the waratah was featured heavily in the first edition of its journal ''Australian Plants''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asgap.org.au/payne.html|title=Vale - Bill Payne|last=Hockings|first=David|date=November 27 2005|work=Australian Native Plants Society website|publisher=Australian Native Plants Society |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

Today, they are are grown commercially in Australia north of Sydney and in the [[Dandenong Ranges]] near [[Melbourne]]. They are also grown commercially in [[New Zealand]], [[Israel]],<ref name=ANBG/> and [[Hawaii]], where they have been grown since 1961.<ref name=EJ10>{{cite book |author=Eliot Rodger W.; Jones, David L.; Blake, Trevor |title=Encyclopaedia of Australian Plants Suitable for Cultivation:Volume 9 - Sp-Z|year=2010 |publisher=Lothian Press |location=Port Melbourne |isbn=0-7344-0974-4|pages=200-03}}</ref> One major challenge is that the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks) in any one location. The season may be extended, however, with plants grown at different latititudes. The vase life of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.<ref name=Nixon25/>

Although they grow naturally on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage.
Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun,<ref name="Mountain Nursery">{{cite web |url=http://www.mountain-nursery.com.au/warainfo.htm |title=Growing Waratahs commercially |accessdate=March 27 2008 |work=Mountain Nursery website}}</ref> although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991">{{cite book | last = Wrigley | first = John |coauthors = Fagg, Murray | title = Banksias, Waratahs and Grevilleas | year = 1991 | publisher = Angus & Robertson | location = Sydney | isbn = 0-207-17277-3|pages = 538<U+2013>41}}</ref> Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates plants and promotes more profuse flowering in the next season.<ref name=ANBG/> Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds.<ref name=Nixon58>Nixon, p. 58. </ref> Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> The species is readily [[plant propagation|propagated]] from fresh [[seed]], although cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.<ref name= "Growing Waratahs">{{cite web|title=Growing waratahs|work=Plants for gardens|publisher=Botanic Gardens Trust|url=http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/plant_info/Plants_for_gardens/Growing_waratahs|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> 

Several species of fungi infect the roots of waratahs, causing significant plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part or all of the plant, or lack of proteoid roots.<ref name=Nixon56>Nixon, p. 56. </ref> The most common pathogen is ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'',<ref name=Nixon57>Nixon, p. 57. </ref> which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than with wild populations.<ref name=Woodford>{{cite news|author=Woodford, James|title=Waratah faces a fight to preserve its blooming life|publisher=The Age|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/09/20/1032054962838.html|accessdate=9 March 2010}}</ref> Mass plantings at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] in Sydney and at [[Mount Annan]] planted before the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] were devastated by the disease.<ref name=Woodford/> ''[[Rhizoctonia solani]]'' can cause damping off or root rot,<ref name=Nixon57/> and is an uncommon pathogen.

The larvae of the moth species the Macadamia leafminer (''[[Acocercops chionosema]]'') burrow along and disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly a problem in lowering the value of cut flower crops. More problematic is the larger caterpillar of the moth species the Macadamia twig girdler (''[[Xylorycta luteotactella]]'') which can burrow into and disfigure the developing flowerhead.<ref name=Nixon57/><!-- cites both sentences -->

===Cultivars===
[[File:Telopea light shade of pale 3 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|''Telopea'' 'Shade of Pale']]
A number of natural forms have been selected for cultivation as follows:
*''' ''Telopea'' 'Brimstone Blush'''' is a shrub of smaller size than the species, reaching a metre (3 ft) tall, and was originally found growing on a property of a Ben Richards in [[Oakdale, New South Wales|Oakdale]], southwest of Sydney. Flowering takes place in October. The flowerhead is globular with a pink crown and has 160 individual flowers, the styles of which are pink and white towards the ends. Three rows of whorled dark red bracts surround the flowerheads.<ref name=Nixon33>Nixon, p. 33.</ref> 
* '''''Telopea'' 'Cardinal' ''' is a form found on the property of Lucille Pope in Werombi. The orginal plant was a vigorous specimen reaching 3 by 3 metres and producing 100 to 120 flowerheads each year. It is named for its large dome-shaped cardinal red flowerheads, which bear 210 individual flowers and are surrounded by two rows of dark red bracts. These blooms have long vase life.<ref name=Nixon334>Nixon, pp. 33-34.</ref> 
* '''''Telopea'' 'Corroboree' '''- form with longer styles, it has compact inflorescences measuring  12&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in) high and wide, and is a vigorous grower. It was selected in 1974 by Nanette Cuming  of [[Bittern, Victoria]] and registered with the [[Australian Cultivar Registration Authority]] in 1989. It is grown principally for the cut flower industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/acra/descriptions/acc457.html|title=Telopea 'Corroboree'|last=Australian Cultivar Registration Austhority|work=ACRA: Descriptions of Registered Cultivars|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref>
*''' ''Telopea'' 'Fire and Brimstone'''' is a vigorous form with large inflorescences selected by waratah grower and author Paul Nixon of [[Camden, New South Wales]].

The stigmas are a light red and tipped with white. The bracts surrounding the flowerheads are relatively small, while the leaves are large and can reach 44 cm (18 in) in length.<ref name=Nixon34>Nixon, p. 34.</ref> The cultivar is thought to be tetraploid.<ref name=Wildside/> With a long vase life of 17 days, the cultivar is suitable for the cut flower industry.<ref name=Nixon34/>
* '''''Telopea'' 'Galaxy'''' has flowerheads with pinkish red tepals and white tips to the styles, surrounded by large bracts.<ref name=EJ10/>
* '''''Telopea'' 'Olympic Flame'''' is a form with prominent bracts around the flowerheads. It has large leaves with toothed margins and flowers in early spring. Also known as 'Sunburst', it arose as a seedling in a breeding program conducted by Cathy Offord, Peter Goodwin and Paul Nixon under the auspices of the [[University of Sydney]].<ref name=Wildside/>
* '''''Telopea'' 'Parry's Dream'''' was a chance seedling in the early 1970s. It gave rise to this cultivar, a vigorous plant with red-pink flowerheads which reach a diameter of 10 x 10 cm (4 x 4 in) surrounded by pink bracts.<ref name=EJ10/>
* '''''Telopea'' 'Shade of Pale'''' is an unusual pale-pink flowered form of ''T. speciosissima''.<ref name=Wildside/> It is less vigorous than the parent plant. It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in a registered cultivar name.
* '''''Telopea'' 'Sunflare'''' is an early-flowering form. It has large leaves with toothed margins and flowers in early spring. It also arose as a seedling in the same breeding program by the University of Sydney mentioned above.<ref name=Wildside/> Selected in 1981, it has red flowerheads with white-tipped styles which reach 9 cm (3.6 in) in diameter.<ref name=EJ10/> 
[[Image:Wwaratah.jpg|thumb|right|''Telopea'' 'Wirrimbirra White']]
* '''''Telopea'' 'Wirrimbirra White'''' is a white colour form from Kangaloon near [[Robertson, New South Wales|Robertson]]. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered but none had been previously preserved in horticulture. [[Joseph Maiden]] had previously found a white waratah near [[Kurrajong, New South Wales|Kurrajong]],<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/><!-- refs all para --> and others had been sighted near [[Narara, New South Wales|Narara]] on the Central Coast in 1919, and [[Colo Vale, New South Wales|Colo Vale]] in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant.<ref name=Nixon38>Nixon, p. 38.</ref> 'Wirrimbirra White was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant which grew on water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence.

In addition, a number of interspecific hybrids have also been produced. These have been bred or used as more frost- or shade-tolerant plants in cooler climates such as Canberra, Melbourne or elsewhere.

* '''''Telopea'' 'Braidwood Brilliant'''' is a frost-tolerant hybrid between a male ''T. speciosissima'' and female [[Telopea mongaensis|''T. mongaensis'']]. Dr Robert Boden of the Canberra Parks Administration began investigating this hybrid in 1962, and it was registered in 1975 by Richard Powell. It is a ligntuberous shrub to 3 metres (10&nbsp;ft) high and has oblanceolate leaves to 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) long. The red blooms are 6<U+2013>8&nbsp;cm (2.4-3.2&nbsp;in) in diameter, intermediate in size between the parent species.<ref name = "Wrigley 1991"/> It has grown well in cooler climates such as Canberra.<ref name=Nixon32>Nixon, p. 32.</ref>

The striking form of the New South Wales Waratah became a popular [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] in [[Visual arts of Australia|Australian art]] in the early part of the twentieth century and was incorporated in [[art nouveau]] designs of the time. Matchboxes, paperweights and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. [[Arnott's Biscuits Holdings|Arnott's]] often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s.<ref name=Nice54>Nice, p. 54.</ref> Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]], also displayed it on their label.<ref name=Nice54/>

In 1925, artist [[Margaret Preston]] produced a hand-coloured [[woodcut]] depicting waratahs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Margaret Preston|work=Floral Emblems of Australia|publisher=[[Australian National Botanic Gardens]]|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/preston.waratah.html|accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref> The species also appeared on an Australian 3 [[Shilling (Australian)|shilling]] stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968.<ref name=ANBG/>

After Federation took place in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle ''[[Acacia pycnantha]]'', and debate raged between proponents of the two flowers.  The economist and botanist [[Richard Thomas Baker|R. T. Baker]] proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence  of its flowers.<ref name=Nixon85>Nixon, p. 85.</ref> He was nicknamed the "Commander in Chief of the Waratah Armed Forces".<ref name=Nice30>Nice, p. 30.</ref> The South Australian ''Evening News'' also supported the bid, but to no avail.<ref name=Nixon85/>

It was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of New South Wales in 1962 by the then governor Sir [[Eric Woodward]], after being used informally for many years.<ref name=Nixon86>Nixon, p. 86.</ref> Since that time, the species has also been adopted by others, including the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] rugby union team since the 1880s,<ref name=Nice54/>  and the former department store [[Grace Brothers|Grace Bros]] in the 1980s.<ref name=Nice54/> Contemporary clothing designers [[Jenny Kee]] and [[Linda Jackson (designer)|Linda Jackson]] produced waratah-inspired fabric designs in the 1970s and 1980s during a resurgence of Australian motifs.<ref name=Nice56>Nice, p. 56.</ref><ref name=powerhouse>{{cite web|title=Influence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander textiles on non-indigenous Australians|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/hsc/paperbark/influence.htm|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref>
