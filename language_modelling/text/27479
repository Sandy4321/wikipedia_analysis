In this game, Espio's color subtly changes while he moves, which demonstrated the technical capabilities of the [[Sega 32X]] console.<ref name="xboxworld"/> Espio was incorporated into ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'' as part of a move to reintroduce neglected characters, and because the development team considered him to have a unique, interesting personality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Afterthoughts: Sonic Heroes|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116996|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> In this game, he was the designated "speed" character while teammates [[Vector the Crocodile (character)|Vector the Crocodile]] and [[List of recurring characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Charmy Bee|Charmy Bee]] respectively represented "power" and "flight".<ref name="profiles"/> 

Espio's design is that of a 16-year-old [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] purple [[chameleon]] who stands at 110 cm (3' 7.3") and 36 kg (79.4 lbs).<ref name="sega">{{cite web|title=<U+30A8><U+30B9><U+30D4><U+30AA><U+30FB><U+30B6><U+30FB><U+30AB><U+30E1><U+30EC><U+30AA><U+30F3>|publisher=[[Sega]]|url=http://sonic.sega.jp/SonicChannel/chara/espio/index.html|language=Japanese|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> He is cool-headed, not threatened by danger,<ref name="profiles">{{cite web|title=Sonic Heroes Profiles: Team Chaotix|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/444/444347p1.html|date=December 4, 2003|last=Dunham|first=Jeremy|authorlink=Jeremy Dunham|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> and disciplined, but often arrogant and opinionated.<ref name="heroesmanual">''[[Sonic Heroes]]'' (GameCube) instruction manual, p. 12.</ref> Claustrophobia is his main weakness.<ref name="fighters">{{cite web|title=Gems Collection: The Fighters|url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/639/639843p2.html|publisher=IGN|date=August 5, 2005|last=Castro|first=Juan|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> Due to his training as a [[ninja]] and his ability to turn [[invisibility|invisible]] at will, he is able to move unnoticed.<ref name="profiles"/> He can move on ceilings and walls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Knuckles Chaotix Review|url=http://screwattack.com/videos/Knuckles-Chaotix-Review-1|publisher=[[ScrewAttack]]|date=December 30, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>

Espio debuted in ''Knuckles' Chaotix'' as a [[player character]] alongside the rest of the Chaotix<U+2014>a team which included [[Mighty the Armadillo]] in this game<U+2014>as well as [[Knuckles the Echidna]] and two robots named Heavy and Bomb.<ref name="ign kc"/> The premise involves [[Doctor Ivo Robotnik|Doctor Eggman]] using power from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Chaos Emeralds|Chaos Emerald]] that powers the "Carnival Island" amusement park in order to power his own "Combi Confiner" machine. Knuckles, who patrols the island, finds that Eggman has captured the Chaotix. Once Espio is rescued, he joins with Knuckles to defeat Eggman.

The Chaotix is one of four playable three-player teams in ''Sonic Heroes''.<ref name="profiles"/> The team receives a package in the mail which contains a [[walkie-talkie]] through which an unknown client requests the team's help, promising to "pay handsomely". Espio is suspicious, but Vector and Charmy focus on the opportunity to make money, to which Espio consents.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Sonic Heroes]]|developer=[[Sonic Team#Sega Studio USA (Sonic Team USA)|Sega Studio USA]]|quote='''Charmy:''' It's here, it's here... we've got work! / '''Vector:''' WHAT?

(Vector's and Charmy's eyes appear as dollar signs for a second, then revert to normal) / '''Espio:''' I've got a bad feeling about this... / '''Vector:''' Espio, don't be silly! Besides, you know our policy. We never turn down work that pays! / '''Charmy:''' Yeah, you know our policy! / '''Vector:''' C'mon boys, let's go! / '''Espio:''' Roger.}}</ref> As the quest progresses, Espio begins to suspect that the owner of the voice is a relative of Doctor Eggman, a sentiment which Vector deems feasible.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic Heroes|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Espio:''' Definitely an agent... a relative, perhaps. / '''Vector:''' Strangely enough, I had the same weird feeling about our clients' {{sic}} REAL identity.}}</ref> When the client is revealed to be Eggman himself, the team is disappointed at their own incompetence. Eggman then reveals that he plans to [[world domination|conquer the world]] before paying them, which leads to Charmy beating him up.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic Heroes|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Vector:''' We're here to save you.

It's no trick and besides I plan on paying you. You'll be rewarded handsomely for helping me!

(proceeds to beat Eggman up) / '''Eggman:''' Whaaaaaaaa! Aaaaahhhhh!!}}</ref>

In a "Hero"-type mission in ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', Espio requests [[Shadow the Hedgehog]]'s help in extracting data from Eggman's computer database.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]|developer=Sega Studio USA|quote='''Espio:''' Shadow, thanks for your help earlier.
