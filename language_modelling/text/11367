The '''Myasishchev M-55''' ([[NATO reporting name]]: '''''Mystic''''') is a high altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] developed by the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Myasishchev|Myasishchev design bureau]]. It is similar in both its mission and design to the American [[Lockheed U-2]] [[spy plane]]. It is a development of the '''M-17'''. Differences include two turbofan engines instead of one and greater [[maximum take-off weight]].

==Development==
The M-55 was first known as the M-17. Its life began in [[1978]] when Soviet engineers searched for ways to intercept American unmanned reconnaissance [[balloon]]s. The first flight of the M-17 was [[26 May]] [[1982]]; this aircraft was soon detected by U.S. observers. With the introduction of another model of this class, this interceptor M-17 would later become known as the M-17 '''''Mystic-A'''''.

The Mystic-A set 25 [[world record]]s for its class. However, this balloon-interceptor model was terminated in [[1987]] and replaced by the M-17RN, also known as the M-55 Geophysica, which was dubbed by [[NATO]] '''''Mystic-B'''''. The first one of these flew in [[1988]], but as the Soviet Union collapsed, military demand dropped. In [[1994]], the reconnaissance version was terminated after only five aircraft were built.

A number of M-55 Geophysica remain in service, performing in [[research]] roles.  One M-55 took part in a study of the [[Arctic]] [[stratosphere]] in [[1996]]-[[1997]].
