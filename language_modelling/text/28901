'''Pierre Ab<U+00E9>lard''' (in English, '''Peter Abelard''') or '''Abailard''' ([[1079]] <U+2013> [[April 21]], [[1142]]) was a French [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]] and [[logician]]. The story of his affair with his student, [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se]], has become legendary.

== Life ==
=== Youth ===

He was born in the little village of Pallet, about 10 miles east of [[Nantes]], in [[Brittany]], the eldest son of a noble [[Brittany|Breton]] family. The name Abaelardus (also written Abailardus, Abaielardus, and in many other ways) is said to be a corruption of Hab<U+00E9>lardus, substituted by Ab<U+00E9>lard himself for a nickname ('Bajolardus') given him when a student. As a boy, he learned quickly, and, choosing an academic life instead of the military career usual for one of his birth, acquired the art of [[dialectic]] (a branch of [[philosophy]]) which at that time consisted chiefly of the logic of [[Aristotle]] transmitted through [[Latin]] channels and which was the great subject of liberal study in the [[Episcopal]] schools. The nominalist [[Roscellinus]], the famous [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Compiegne]], claims to have been his teacher; but whether this was in early youth, when he wandered from school to school for instruction and exercise, or some years later, after he had already begun to teach, remains uncertain.

=== Rise to fame ===

Ab<U+00E9>lard's travels finally brought him to [[Paris]] while still in his teens. There, in the great cathedral school of Notre-Dame de Paris{{ref|autonumber}},he was taught for a while by [[William of Champeaux]], the disciple of [[Anselm of Laon]] (not to be confused with [[Anselm of Canterbury|Saint Anselm]]) and most advanced of Realists. He was soon able to defeat the master in argument, resulting in a long duel that ended in the downfall of the philosophic theory of [[Realism]], till then dominant in the early [[Middle Ages]] (to be replaced by Ab<U+00E9>lard's [[Conceptualism]], or by [[Nominalism]], the principal rival of Realism prior to Ab<U+00E9>lard). First, against opposition from the metropolitan teacher, while yet only twenty-two, Ab<U+00E9>lard set up a school of his own at [[Melun]], then, for more direct competition, he moved to [[Corbeil]], nearer Paris.

The success of his teaching was notable, though for a time he had to give it up, the strain proving too great for his constitution. On his return, after 1108, he found William lecturing in a monastic retreat outside the city, and there they once again became rivals. Ab<U+00E9>lard was once more victorious, and now stood supreme. William was only temporarily able to prevent him from lecturing in Paris. From Melun, where he had resumed teaching, Ab<U+00E9>lard went on to the capital, and set up his school on the heights of [[Montagne Sainte-Genevi<U+00E8>ve]], overlooking Notre-Dame. From his success in dialectic, he next turned to [[theology]] and attended the lectures of Anselm at [[Laon]]. His triumph was complete; the pupil was able to give lectures, without previous training or special study, which were acknowledged superior to those of the master. Ab<U+00E9>lard was now at the height of his fame. He stepped into the chair at Notre-Dame, being also nominated canon, about the year 1115.

Distinguished in figure and manners, Ab<U+00E9>lard was seen surrounded by crowds - it is said thousands of students - drawn from all countries by the fame of his teaching. Enriched by the offerings of his pupils, and entertained with universal admiration, he came, as he says, to think himself the only undefeated philosopher in the world. But a change in his fortunes was at hand. In his devotion to science, he had always lived a very regular life, enlivened only by philosophical debate: now, at the height of his fame, he encountered romance.

# {{Note|autonumber}} ''Though it was located on the same spot in the [[<U+00CE>le de la Cit<U+00E9>]], the cathedral of Ab<U+00E9>lard's time was not the same as the cathedral we see today. Construction on the current [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] would not be begun until 1163''.

=== His love, H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se ===

[[Image:Abelard and Heloise.jpeg|thumb|Ab<U+00E9>lard and H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se depicted in a 14<sup>th</sup> century manuscript]]

Living within the precincts of Notre-Dame, under the care of her uncle, the canon Fulbert, was a girl named [[Heloise (student of Abelard)|H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se]] (1095-1163). She is said to have been beautiful, but still more remarkable for her knowledge, which extended beyond Latin to [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Ab<U+00E9>lard fell in love with her; and he sought and gained a place in Fulbert's house. Becoming tutor to the girl, he used his power for the purpose of seduction, and she returned his devotion. Their relations interfered with his public work, and were not kept a secret by Ab<U+00E9>lard himself. Soon everyone knew except the trusting Fulbert. Once her uncle found out, the lovers were separated, only to meet in secret. H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se became pregnant, and was carried off by Ab<U+00E9>lard to [[Brittany]], where she gave birth to a son called Astralabe. To appease her furious uncle, Ab<U+00E9>lard proposed a secret marriage, in order not to mar his prospects of advancement in the church; but H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se opposed the idea. She appealed to him not to sacrifice for her the independence of his life, but reluctantly gave in to pressure. The secret of the marriage was not kept by Fulbert; and when H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se boldly denied it, life was made so difficult for her that she sought refuge in the convent of [[Argenteuil]] at Ab<U+00E9>lard's bidding. Immediately Fulbert, believing that H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se's husband, who had helped her run away, wanted to be rid of her, plotted revenge. He and some others broke into Ab<U+00E9>lard's chamber by night, and [[castration|castrated]] him. The priesthood and ecclesiastical office were, thereby, canonically closed to him. H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se, still only in her twenties, agreed to become a [[nun]] at the bidding of Abelard, who would never be able to function as a husband again.
According to Australian historian Constant Mews, a set of 113 anonymous love letters found in a fifteenth century manuscript represent the correspondence exchanged by H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se and Ab<U+00E9>lard during the earlier phase of their affair.

=== Later life ===

It was in the [[abbey of Saint-Denis]] that Ab<U+00E9>lard, now aged forty, sought to bury himself as a monk with his woes out of sight. Finding no respite in the [[cloister]], and having gradually turned again to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at the priory of [[Maisonceile]] (1120). His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, were once again heard by crowds of students, and all his old influence seemed to have returned; but he still had many enemies, against whom he could make less vigorous opposition. No sooner had he published his theological lectures (apparently the ''Introductio ad Theologiam'') than his adversaries picked up on his rationalistic interpretation of the [[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]] dogma. Charging him with the heresy of [[Sabellianism|Sabellius]] in a provincial [[synod]] held at [[Soissons]] in 1121, they obtained through irregular procedures an official condemnation of his teaching, and he was made to burn his book before being shut up in the convent of St. Medard at Soissons. It was the bitterest possible experience that could befall him. The life in his own monastery proved no more congenial than formerly. For this Ab<U+00E9>lard himself was partly responsible. He took a sort of malicious pleasure in irritating the monks. As if for the sake of a joke, he cited [[Bede]] to prove that [[Dionysius the Areopagite]] had been Bishop of [[Corinth]], while they relied upon the statement of the Abbot Hilduin that he had been Bishop of Athens. When this historical heresy led to the inevitable persecution, Ab<U+00E9>lard wrote a letter to the Abbot Adam in which he preferred to the authority of Bede that of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s ''Historia Ecelesiastica'' and St. [[Jerome]], according to whom Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth, was distinct from Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens and founder of the abbey, though, in deference to Bede, he suggested that the Areopagite might also have been bishop of Corinth. Life in the monastery was intolerable for Ab<U+00E9>lard, and he was finally allowed to leave. In a desert place near [[Nogent-sur-Seine]], he built himself a cabin of stubble and reeds, and turned [[hermit]]. When his retreat became known, students flocked from Paris, and covered the wilderness around him with their tents and huts. When he began to teach again he found consolation, and in gratitude he consecrated the new [[Oratory of the Paraclete]].

[[Image:AbelardHeloiseTomb.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Composite image of the tomb of Ab<U+00E9>lard et H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se and various details]]

Ab<U+00E9>lard, fearing new persecution, left the Oratory to find another refuge, accepting an invitation to preside over the abbey of [[Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys]], on the far-off shore of Lower Brittany. The region was inhospitable, the domain a prey to outlaws, the house itself savage and disorderly. Yet for nearly ten years he continued to struggle with fate before he left. The misery of those years was lightened because he had been able, on the breaking up of H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se's convent at Argenteuil, to establish her as head of a new religious house at the deserted Paraclete, and in the capacity of spiritual director he often was called to revisit the spot thus made doubly dear to him. All this time H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se had lived respectably. Living on for some time apart (we do not know exactly where), after his flight from the Abbey of St Gildas, Ab<U+00E9>lard wrote, among other things, his famous ''[[Historia Calamitatum]]'', and thus moved her to write her first Letter, which remains an unsurpassed utterance of human passion and womanly devotion; the first being followed by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation which, now as a brother to a sister, Ab<U+00E9>lard commended to her. He soon returned to the site of his early triumphs lecturing on Mount St. Genevieve in 1136 (when he was heard by John of Salisbury), but it was only for a brief time: a last great trial awaited him. As far back as the Paraclete days, his chief enemy had been [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], in whom was incarnated the principle of fervent and unhesitating faith, from which rational inquiry like Ab<U+00E9>lard's was sheer revolt, and now the uncompromising Bernard was moving to crush the growing evil in the person of the boldest offender. After preliminary negotiations, in which Bernard was roused by Ab<U+00E9>lard's steadfastness to put forth all his strength, a council met at [[Sens]] (1141), before which Ab<U+00E9>lard, formally arraigned upon a number of heretical charges, was prepared to plead his cause. When, however, Bernard had opened the case, suddenly Ab<U+00E9>lard appealed to Rome. Bernard, who had power, notwithstanding, to get a condemnation passed at the council, did not rest a moment till a second condemnation was procured at Rome in the following year. Meanwhile, on his way there to urge his plea in person, Ab<U+00E9>lard collapsed at the abbey of [[Cluny]], and there he lingered only a few months before the approach of death. Removed by friends, for the relief of his sufferings, to the priory of St. Marcel, near [[Chalon-sur-Saone]], he died. First buried at St. Marcel, his remains were soon carried off secretly to the Paraclete, and given over to the loving care of H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se, who in time came herself to rest beside them (1163). The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the [[French Revolution]], and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in the cemetery of [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise]] in eastern Paris, though there seems to be some dissent as to their actual resting place.

The Oratory of the Paraclete claims he and H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se are buried on their site and that what exists in P<U+00E8>re-Lachaise is merely a monument. According to P<U+00E8>re-Lachaise, the remains of both lovers were translated from the Oratory in the early 1800's and reburied in the famous crypt on their grounds. There are still others who believe that while Ab<U+00E9>lard is buried in the tomb at P<U+00E8>re-Lachaise, Helo<U+00EF>se's remains are elsewhere.

== Reception ==

Ab<U+00E9>lard was an enormous influence on his contemporaries and the course of medieval thought, but he has been known in modern times mainly for his connection with H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se. It was not till the 19th century, when Cousin in 1836 issued the collection entitled ''Ouvrages inedits d'Ab<U+00E9>lard'', that his philosophical performance could be judged at first hand; of his strictly philosophical works only one, the ethical treatise ''Scito te ipsum'', having been published earlier, namely, in 1721. Cousin's collection, besides giving extracts from the theological work ''[[Sic et Non]]'' ("Yes and No") (an assemblage of opposite opinions on doctrinal points, culled from the Fathers as a basis for discussion, the main interest in which lies in the fact that there is no attempt to reconcile the different opinions), includes the ''Dialectica'', commentaries on logical works of Aristotle, Porphyry and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], and a fragment, ''De Generibus et Speciebus.'' The last-named work, and also the psychological treatise ''De Intellectibus,'' published apart by Cousin (in ''Fragmens Philosophiques,'' vol. ii.), are now considered upon internal evidence not to be by Ab<U+00E9>lard himself, but only to have sprung out of his school. A genuine work, the ''Glossulae super Porphyrium,'' from which [[Charles de R<U+00E9>musat]], in his classical monograph ''Ab<U+00E9>lard'' (1845), has given extracts, was published in 1930.

== Philosophical work ==
{{expandsect}}
The general importance of Ab<U+00E9>lard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with its object of giving a formally rational expression to the received ecclesiastical doctrine. However his own particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13<sup>th</sup> century with approval from the heads of the church. Through him was prepared in the Middle Age the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of Aristotle, which became firmly established in the half-century after his death, when first the completed [[Organon]], and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, came to be known in the schools: before his time it was rather upon the authority of Plato that the prevailing Realism sought to lean. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of Universals, see [[Scholasticism]]. Outside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Ab<U+00E9>lard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought; laying very particular stress upon the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, wherein he anticipated something of modern speculation, is the more remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after the great ethical inquiries of Aristotle became fully known to them.

Ab<U+00E9>lard's own works remain the best sources for his life, especially his ''[[Historia Calamitatum]],'' an autobiography, and the correspondence with H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se. The literature on Ab<U+00E9>lard is extensive, but consists principally of monographs on different aspects of his philosophy. [[Charles de Remusat]]'s ''Abelard'' (2 vols., 1845) remains an authority; it must be distinguished from his drama ''Abelard'' (1877), which is an attempt to give a picture of medieval life. McCabe's ''Life of Abelard'' is written closely from the sources. See also the valuable analysis by Nitsch in the article ''Abalard''. There is a comprehensive bibliography in U. Chevalier, ''Repertoire des sources hist. du moyen age,'' s. "Abailard."

== Music ==

Today Ab<U+00E9>lard is known largely as a philosopher who had a tragic love affair with H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se. However, Ab<U+00E9>lard was also long known as an important [[poet]] and [[composer]]. Ab<U+00E9>lard composed some celebrated love songs, that are now lost, for H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se.

Ab<U+00E9>lard later wrote the words and melodies for over a hundred hymns for the religious community that H<U+00E9>lo<U+00EF>se joined. Melodies that have survived have been praised as "flexible, expressive melodies (that) show an elegance and technical adroitness that are very similar to the qualities that have been long admired in Ab<U+00E9>lard's poetry." ([http://www.gramophone.co.uk/gramofilereview.asp?reviewID=9503094&mediaID=38977&issue=Reviewed%3A+Gramophone+3%2F1995 Micheal Oliver], reviewing a CD of Ab<U+00E9>lard's music in [[Gramophone]], 1995)

Ab<U+00E9>lard also left six biblical ''planctus'' ([[lament]]s) which were very original and influenced the subsequent development of the [[lai]], a song form that flourished in northern Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries
