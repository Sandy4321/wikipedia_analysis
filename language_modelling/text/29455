'''Oswaldo Pay<U+00E1> Sardi<U+00F1>as''' (29 February 1952&nbsp;<U+2013> 22 July 2012) was a Cuban political activist. A [[Roman Catholic]], he founded the [[Christian Liberation Movement]] in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the [[Cuban Communist Party]]. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the [[Varela Project]], in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] as well as to institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the [[European Parliament]]'s [[Sakharov Prize]] and [[People in Need (Czech Republic)|People in Need]]'s [[Homo Homini Award]]. 

On 22 July 2012, he died in a car crash under controversial circumstances. The Cuban government stated that the driver had lost control of the vehicle and collided with a tree, while Pay<U+00E1>'s children and one of the car's passengers asserted that the car had been deliberately run off of the road.

==Background==
Oswaldo Pay<U+00E1> was born on 29 February 1952 in [[Cerro, Havana]].<ref name=OP>{{cite web |url=http://www.oswaldopaya.org/es/sobre-oswaldo/ |language=Spanish |title=Acerca de Oswaldo |publisher=oswaldopaya.org |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a [[Roman Catholic]]<ref name=LAT/> and attended a [[Marist Brothers]] school in Havana.<ref name=MH/> Pay<U+00E1> was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the [[Cuban Revolution]].<ref name=PB>{{cite book |title=A Contemporary Cuba Reader: Reinventing the Revolution |last=Philip Brenner |year=2008 |publisher=Rowan & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-5507-5 |pages=106<U+2013>09 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LjKoLe9jWKoC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106&dq=Oswaldo+Pay%C3%A1&source=bl&ots=TWugxUdiQN&sig=ZRuU62LADbuW31KXWgrRzROy5ug&hl=en&sa=X&ei=a-IOUM3CC7C_2QXq4IGQAw&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Oswaldo%20Pay%C3%A1&f=false |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> The school was later closed.<ref name=WP /> In 1969, he was sentenced to three years of hard labor on [[Isla de Pinos]] when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service.<ref name=bbc23712>{{cite news|title=Top Cuba dissident Oswaldo Paya 'killed in car crash'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18949685|accessdate=23 July 2012|publisher=BBC News|date=23 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=HP /> While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Dolores, that received permission from the [[Bishop of Havana]] to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick.<ref name=PB />

After his release, Pay<U+00E1> enrolled in the [[University of Havana]] as a physics major, but was expelled when authorities discovered him to be a practicing Christian; he then attended night school and switched his major to telecommunications.<ref name=WP /> Pay<U+00E1> later became an engineer and worked at a state surgical-equipment company.<ref name=LAT>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-oswaldo-paya-20120724,0,5477537.story |title=Oswaldo Paya dies at 60; Cuban anti-Castro activist |date=24 July 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> He was offered an opportunity to leave Cuba in the 1980 [[Mariel boatlift]], but chose to remain in Cuba and work for change.<ref name=PB /> He married Ofelia Acevedo in 1986 in a Catholic wedding.<ref name=WP /> The pair had three children: Oswaldo Jos<U+00E9>, Rosa Mar<U+00ED>a, and Reinaldo Isa<U+00ED>as.<ref name=HP />

==Varela Project==
In 1987, Pay<U+00E1> founded the [[Christian Liberation Movement]] (MCL), which called for nonviolent civil disobedience against the rule of the [[Cuban Communist Party]].<ref name=OP/><ref name=LAT/> The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for political prisoners.<ref name=BBC237>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18963608 |title=Cuba dissident 'driven off road' to death, says family |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> He also began a magazine for Catholics titled ''People of God'' (''Pueblo de Dios''), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Pay<U+00E1> attempted to run for the [[National Assembly of People's Power]] (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.<ref name=PB />

In the late 1990s, Pay<U+00E1> and other MCL activists began collecting signatures for the [[Varela Project]], a petition drive that would become his best-known program. Named in honor of [[F<U+00E9>lix Varela]], a [[Catholic priest]] who had participated in Cuba's independence struggle with Spain,<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/07/22/2907342/oswaldo-paya-well-known-cuban.html |title=Oswaldo Pay<U+00E1>, well-known Cuban dissident, killed in car crash on the island |author=Mimi Whitefield |date=23 July 2012 |work=The Miami Herald |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> the Project took advantage of a clause in the [[Cuban Constitution]] requiring a national referendum to be held if 11,000 signatures are gathered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/13/world/cuba-can-t-ignore-a-dissident-it-calls-insignificant.html |title=Cuba Can't Ignore a Dissident It Calls Insignificant |author=David Gonzalez |date=13 October 2002 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

In May 2002, Pay<U+00E1> presented NAPP with 11,020 signatures calling for a referendum on safeguarding freedom of speech and assembly,<ref name=NYT /> allowing private business ownership,<ref name=BBC1712 /> and ending to one-party rule.<ref name=bbc23712 /> On 3 October 2003, he delivered an additional 14,000 signatures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3163048.stm |title=New petition for Cuba changes |author=Stephen Gibbs |date=3 October 2003 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> Former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] endorsed the petition when granted a chance to speak on Cuban television, bringing Pay<U+00E1>'s efforts to the attention of a wide Cuban audience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/23/world/americas/cuba-dissident-death/index.html |title=Details of crash that killed Cuban dissident disputed |author=Patrick Oppman |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] described the petition drive as a U.S.-backed conspiracy to overthrow his government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=25341 |title=Cuban dissident leader Oswaldo Paya dies in alleged accident |date=24 July 2012 |agency=Catholic News Agency |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the petition drive was "the biggest nonviolent campaign to change the system the elder Castro established after the 1959 Cuban revolution", giving Pay<U+00E1> an international reputation as a leading dissident.<ref name=LAT/> An expert described it as "the only initiative of its time that enlisted citizen participation on a large scale".<ref name=NYT>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/world/americas/oswaldo-paya-60-cuban-human-rights-fighter-dies.html |title=Oswaldo Pay<U+00E1>, Cuban Leader of Petition Drive for Human Rights, Dies at 60 |author=Damien Cave |date=23 July 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Fellow dissident [[Rene Gomez Manzano]], on the other hand, was critical of the Project, stating that appeals to the Communist-Party-controlled NAPP were futile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/07/120722_americalatina_figura_oswaldo_paya_bd.shtml |language=Spanish |title=Adi<U+00F3>s al padre del mayor movimiento de disidencia interna en Cuba |author=Fernando Ravensburg |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

Later that year, Pay<U+00E1>'s efforts were recognized by the [[European Parliament]] with its [[Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]],<ref name=NYT /> although he was nearly denied an exit visa to attend the awards ceremony.<ref name=BBC1712 /> In the months that followed, Pay<U+00E1> met with Pope [[John Paul II]], U.S. Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], and Mexican President [[Vicente Fox]] to discuss the cause of Cuban democratic reform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/18/world/cuban-dissident-ends-tour-hopeful-of-democratic-reform.html |title=Cuban Dissident Ends Tour Hopeful of Democratic Reform |author=David Gonzalez |date=18 January 2003 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> However, the Varela Project was ultimately unsuccessful, as the government launched its own petition drive to declare the socialist state "irrevocable".<ref name=NYT /> During the 2003 crackdown popularly known as the [[Black Spring (Cuba)|Black Spring]], MCL members would comprise around 40 of the 75 defendants, though Pay<U+00E1> himself was not arrested.<ref name=R237>{{cite web |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/cuba-dissident-idINDEE86M0JC20120723 |title=Cuban dissidents gather to mourn Oswaldo Paya |author=Rosa Tania Valdes |date=24 July 2012 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

==Later activism==
During Castro's illness, which culminated in his 2008 resignation, Pay<U+00E1> continued to criticize the Cuban government as it transferred power to Castro's brother [[Ra<U+00FA>l Castro|Ra<U+00FA>l]].<ref name=LAT /> He called on Raul Castro to allow multiparty elections and free all political prisoners,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6920080.stm |title=Cuban dissident in elections call |author=Emilio San Pedro |date=27 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> and delivered a petition asking that the Cuban people be granted freedom of travel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7151710.stm |title=Cuban dissident calls for amnesty |date=19 September 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

In the years before Pay<U+00E1>'s death, his influence was said to be waning, and attention shifted to younger activists such as blogger [[Yoani Sanchez]].<ref name=bbc23712 /> In 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] released [[U.S. State Department]] cables from [[Jonathan D. Farrar]], head of the [[U.S. Interests Section in Havana]], describing Pay<U+00E1> and other older dissidents as "hopelessly out of touch", writing, "They have little contact with younger Cubans and, to the extent they have a message that is getting out, it does not appeal to that segment of society."<ref name=WP>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuban-activist-oswaldo-paya-dies-in-car-crash-fellow-dissidents-say/2012/07/22/gJQAct042W_story.html |title=Cuban activist Oswaldo Paya dies in car crash, fellow dissidents say |date=22 July 2012 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=23 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/12/17/cable-cuban-opposition-touch/ |title=US cable: Cuban opposition out of touch |date=17 December 2010 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Fox News Channel |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> However, many of the younger generation of dissidents cited him as a role model and expressed grief at his death.<ref name=NYT />

==Political views==
Pay<U+00E1> refused to accept U.S. aid and also opposed the U.S. [[Cuban embargo]].<ref name=MH/> In a 2000 editorial for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', he stated that "Lifting the embargo won't solve the problems of the Cuban people. Maintaining it is no solution, either". He called on the U.S. to immediately lift the embargo on food and medicine.<ref name="what">{{cite web |url=http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y00/ago00/14e12.htm |title=What Do Cubans Want? |author=Oswaldo Pay<U+00E1> |date=14 August 2000 |work=The Miami Herald |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

He also maintained his distance from Cuban political groups based in the U.S.<ref name=MH/> In particular, he refused to support their stated goal of land reacquisition upon the return of exiles to Cuba:
:"It is not a neoliberal programme. For this, we are under attack by the powerful groups in Miami. When people say what is going to happen in Cuba after Fidel, we say <U+2013> hold on, there are 11 million people in Cuba, not only Fidel Castro."<ref name="guardian">{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/04/cuba.duncancampbell |title=The rocky road to change |author=Duncan Campbell |date=4 August 2006 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>
In 2005, he also feuded with democracy activist [[Martha Beatriz Roque]], accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification for a further crackdown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4569981.stm |title=Cuba dissidents debate democracy |date=21 May 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions he was allowed to travel abroad, Pay<U+00E1> reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: "I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over but I am not going to run away."<ref name="guardian"/>
