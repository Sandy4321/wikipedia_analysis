The '''hippopotamus''' (''Hippopotamus amphibius''), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+2018><U+03B9><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C2> (''hippopotamos'', ''hippos'' meaning "horse" and ''potamos'' meaning "river"), is a large, mostly [[herbivore|plant-eating]] [[Africa]]n [[mammal]], one of only two extant [[species]] in the [[scientific classification|family]] [[Hippopotamidae]] (the other being the [[Pygmy Hippopotamus]]).

The hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic mammal, inhabiting rivers and lakes in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] in large groups of up to 40 hippos.  During the day they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water, where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river.  They emerge at dusk to graze on grass.  While hippos rest near each other in territories in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land.

Despite their physical resemblance to [[pig]]s and other terrestrial [[even-toed ungulates]], their closest living relatives are [[cetacea]]ns<U+2014>[[whale]]s, [[porpoise]]s and the like.  The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other [[even-toed ungulates]] around {{Mya|60|mya}}.  The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the ''[[Kenyapotamus]]'' in Africa, date to around {{Mya|16|mya}}.

The hippopotamus is recognizable for its barrel-shaped torso, hairless body, stubby legs and tremendous size.  It is similar in size to the [[White Rhinoceros]]; only [[elephant]]s are consistently larger.  Despite its popularity in zoos and cuddly portrayal in fiction, the hippopotamus is among the most dangerous and aggressive of all mammals.  Although there are an estimated 125,000 to 150,000 hippos throughout Sub-Saharan Africa,<ref name="Redlist"/> they are still threatened by poaching and habitat loss.

==Taxonomy and origins==
Hippopotami (''hippopotamuses'' is also accepted as a [[English plural|plural]] form by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]], or ''hippos'' for short), are gregarious, living in groups of up to 40 animals; such a group is called a ''pod'', ''herd'', ''school'', or ''bloat''. A male hippopotamus is known as a ''bull'', a female as a ''cow'', and a baby as a ''calf''.  They are also known as the Common Hippopotamus or the Nile Hippopotamus. 

The hippopotamus is the [[Biological_type#Zoology|type genus]] of the family [[Hippopotamidae]].  The [[Pygmy Hippopotamus]] belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either ''[[Choeropsis]]'' or ''[[Hexaprotodon]]''.  Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as Hippopotamids.  Sometimes the sub-family Hippopotaminae is used.  Further, some taxonomists group hippopotami and [[anthracotheres]] in the super-family ''Anthracotheroidea'' or ''Hippopotamoidea''.

Five subspecies of hippos have been described based on [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences in their skulls and geographical differences:<ref>{{Cite book | author = Lydekker, R. | year = 1915 | title = Catalogue of the Ungulate Mammals in the British Museum of Natural History | volume = 5 | publisher = [[British Museum]] | location = [[London]]}}</ref>
* ''H. a. amphibius'' <U+2013> (the nominate subspecies) which stretched from [[Egypt]], where they are now extinct down the [[Nile River]] to [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].
* ''H. a. kiboko'' <U+2013> in the [[Horn of Africa]], in [[Kenya]] and [[Somalia]].  ''Kiboko'' is the Swahili word for hippo.  Broader nasals and more hollowed interorbital region.
* ''H. a. capensis'' <U+2013> from [[Zambia]] to [[South Africa]].  Most flattened skull of the subspecies.
* ''H. a. tschadensis'' <U+2013> throughout Western Africa to, as the name suggests, [[Chad]].  Slightly shorter and wider face, with prominent orbits.
* ''H. a. constrictus'' <U+2013> in [[Angola]], the southern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Namibia]].  Named for its deeper preorbital constriction.
The suggested subspecies were never widely used or validated by field biologists, the described morphological differences were small enough that they could have resulted in simple variation in non-representative samples.<ref name="The Hippos"/>  Genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies.  A study using [[mitochondrial DNA]] from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, consider genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. They find low but significant genetic differentiation among ''H. a. amphibius'', ''H. a. capensis'', and ''H. a. kiboko''.  Neither ''H.a.constrictus'' nor ''H.a.tschadensis'' have been tested.<ref name="Okello">{{Cite journal | author = Okello, J.B.A | coauthors = Nyakaana, S., Masembe, C., Siegismund, H.R. & Arctander, P. | year = 2005 | title = Mitochondrial DNA variation of the common hippopotamus: evidence for a recent population expansion. | journal = [[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] | volume = 95 | pages = 206-215}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| title = Suiform Soundings: The IUCN/SSC Pigs, Peccaries, and Hippos Specialist Group (PPHSG) Newsletter | volume =  5 | issue = 1 | month = September | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/sgs/pphsg/Suiform%20soundings/Newsletter%205(1).pdf | work = [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]] | author = Meijaard, Erik (ed.)}}</ref>

===Classification===
[[Image:Hippo skull dark.jpg|right|250px|thumbnail|A hippo's [[skull]], showing the large [[canine teeth]] used for fighting.]]
Hippopotamidae are classified along with other [[even-toed ungulates]] in the [[Order (biology)|order]], [[Artiodactyla]].  Other members of Artiodactyla include [[camels]], [[cows]], [[deer]] and [[pigs]]; although hippopotami are not closely related to these species.

As indicated by the name, ancient Greeks considered the hippopotamus to be related to the horse. Until 1985, [[Natural history|naturalists]] grouped hippos with [[pig]]s, based on [[molar (tooth)|molar]] patterns. Evidence, first from [[blood]] [[protein]]s, then from [[molecular systematics]]<ref name="Genomes"/> and [[DNA]]

Thus, hippos are more closely related to whales than to other members of Artiodactyla.  While cetaceans and hippos are each other's closest ''living'' relatives, their lineages split soon after their divergence from the rest of the even-toed ungulates.<ref name="Cetartiodactyla">{{cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |coauthors= Fabrice Lihoreau and Michel Brunet |year= 2005 |month= February|title= The position of Hippopotamidae within Cetartiodactyla|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume= 102 |issue= 5|pages= 1537-1541|url= http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/5/1537|accessdate= 2007-06-09}}</ref><ref name="DNA"/>

===Evolution===
The most recent research into the origins of hippopotamidae suggests that hippos and whales shared a common semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other Artiodactyls around {{mya|60|mya}}.<ref name="ScienceNews"/><ref name="DNA"/>  This hypothesized ancestor likely split into two branches around {{mya|54|mya}}.<ref name="Genomes">{{Cite journal | title = Analyses of mitochondrial genomes strongly support a hippopotamus-whale clade | volume = 265 | issue = 1412 | year = 1998 | pages = 2251 | journal = [[Proceedings of the Royal Society]] | author = Ursing,B.M. | coauthor = U. Arnason}}</ref>  One branch would [[Evolution of cetaceans|evolve into cetaceans]], possibly beginning with the proto-whale ''[[Pakicetus]]'' from {{mya|52|mya}} and other early whale ancestors, known as [[Archaeoceti]], which eventually underwent [[aquatic adaptation]] into the almost completely aquatic [[cetacea]]ns.<ref name="Cetartiodactyla">{{cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |coauthors= Fabrice Lihoreau and Michel Brunet |year= 2005 |month= February|title= The position of Hippopotamidae within Cetartiodactyla|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume= 102 |issue= 5|pages= 1537-1541|url= http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/5/1537|accessdate= 2007-06-09}}</ref>

[[Image:Anthracotherium magnus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Anthracotherium|Anthracotherium magnus]]'', an [[anthracotheriidae|anthracothere]] from the [[Oligocene]], already bore similarities to the modern hippopotamus.]]
The other branch became the [[anthracotheriidae|anthracothere]]s, a large family of four-legged beasts, the earliest of whom in the [[Eocene|Late Eocene]] would have resembled skinny hippopotami with comparatively small and narrow heads.  All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct without leaving any descendants.<ref name="ScienceNews"/>

A rough evolution can be traced, however, from Eocene and [[Oligocene]] species: ''[[Anthracotherium]]'' and ''[[Elomeryx]]'' to the [[Miocene]] anthracotheres ''[[Merycopotamus]]'' and ''[[Libycosaurus]]''.  ''Merycopotamus'', ''Libycosaurus'' and all hippopotamids can be considered to form a [[clade]], with ''Libycosaurus'' being more closely related to hippos.  Their common ancestor would have lived in the Miocene, about {{Mya|20|mya}}.  The last species of anthracotheres became extinct during the [[pliocene]].<ref name="Origins">{{cite journal | last= Boisserie | first=Jean-Renaud | coauthors=Fabrice Lihoreau and Michel Brunet |year=2005 |month=March |title=Origins of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia, Cetartiodactyla): towards resolution |journal=[[Zoologica Scripta]] |volume= 34|issue= 2|pages=119-143 | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1463-6409.2005.00183.x/abs/ | accessdate = 2007-06-01}}</ref>

Hippopotamids are therefore deeply nested within the family [[Anthracotheriidae]].  The oldest known hippopotamid is the genus ''[[Kenyapotamus]]'' which lived in Africa from {{mya|16<U+2013>8|mya}}.  The Hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in Africa, and while at one point the species spread across Asia and Europe, no hippopotami have ever been discovered in the Americas.  From {{mya|7.5<U+2013>1.8|mya}} an ancestor to the modern hippopotamus, the ''[[Archaeopotamus]]'' lived in Africa and the Middle East.<ref name="Linnean">{{cite journal |last=Boisserie |first=Jean-Renaud |year=2005 |title=The phylogeny and taxonomy of Hippopotamidae (Mammalia: Artiodactyla): a review based on morphology and cladistic analysis |journal=[[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume= 143 |pages= 1-26 |url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2004.00138.x/abs/ |accessdate= 2007-06-01}}</ref>

While the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the two modern genera, ''Hippopotamus'' and ''[[Choeropsis]]'' (sometimes ''[[Hexaprotodon]]''), may have diverged as far back as {{mya|8|mya}}.  Scientists disagree whether or not the modern [[Pygmy Hippopotamus]] is a member of ''Hexaprotodon''<U+2014>a genus of many Asian Hippopotami that is more-closely related to ''Hippopotamus''; or ''Choeropsis''<U+2014>an older and [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] genus.<ref name="Linnean"/><ref name="Origins"/>

===Extinct species===
[[Image:Hippopotamus_gorgops.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Hippopotamus gorgops]]'', which had unusually high orbits, lived in Europe but became extinct before the last Ice Age.]]
As many as three species of [[Malagasy Hippopotamus]] became extinct during the [[Holocene]] on [[Madagascar]], one of them within the past 1,000 years.  The Malagasy Hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely through the process of [[insular dwarfism]].<ref name="Stuenes">{{Cite journal | author = Stuenes, Solweig | year = 1989 | title = Taxonomy, habits and relationships of the sub-fossil Madagascan hippopotamuses Hippopotamus lemerlei  and H. madagascariensis. | journal = [[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]] | volume =  9 | pages = 241-268.}}</ref>  There is fossil evidence that many Malagasy Hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction.<ref name="Eighth">{{Cite book | title = The Eighth Continent; Life, Death and Discovery in the Lost World of Madagascar | author = Tyson, Peter | isbn = 0380975777 | year = 2000 | publisher = William Morrow | location = New York}}</ref><ref name="Stuenes"/>  Isolated members of Malagasy Hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the Kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy Hippopotamus.<ref name="Kidoky"> {{Cite journal| title = The Kilopilopitsofy, Kidoky, and Bokyboky: Accounts of Strange Animals from Belo-sur-mer, Madagascar, and the Megafaunal "Extinction Window" | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | month = December | year = 1998 | author = Burney, David A. | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294(199812)2%3A100%3A4%3C957%3ATKKABA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-O | volume = 100 | issue = 4 | pages = 957-966 | coauthors = Ramilisonina}}</ref> 

A separate species of Hippopotamus, the [[European Hippopotamus]] (''H. antiquus'') and ''[[Hippopotamus gorgops|H. gorgops]]'' ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. Both species became extinct before the last glaciation.  Ancestors of European Hippos, found their way to many islands of the [[Mediterranean]], during the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name = "Taxonomy of Pleistocene"> '''Petronio''', C.

These Pleistocene dwarf hippos of the Mediterranean lived on [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|Crete]] (''H. creutzburgi''), [[Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus|Cyprus]] (''H. minor''), [[Maltese Hippopotamus|Malta]] (''H. melitensis'') and [[Sicilian Hippopotamus|Sicily]] (''H. pentlandi'').  Of these, the [[Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus]], survived until the end of the [[Pleistocene]] or early Holocene.

==Description==
[[Image:Hippo zoo Lisbon.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The head of a hippo at the zoo in [[Lisbon]].]]
Hippopotami are one of the largest extant mammals in the world.  Hippos are considered [[megafauna]], but unlike all other African megafauna, hippos have [[adaptation|adapted]] for a semi-aquatic life in freshwater lakes and rivers.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

Because of their enormous size, hippopotami are difficult to weigh in the wild. Most estimates of the weight come from [[culling]] operations that were carried out in the 1960s.  The average weights for adult males ranged between 1500<U+2013>1800&nbsp;kg (3,300<U+2013>4,000&nbsp;lbs).  Females are smaller than their male counterparts, with average weights measuring between 1300<U+2013>1,500&nbsp;kg (2,900<U+2013>3,300&nbsp;lbs).<ref name="The Hippos"/>  Older males can get much larger, reaching at least 3,200&nbsp;kg (7,100&nbsp;lbs).  Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives; females reach a maximum weight at around age 25.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Marshall, P.J. | coauthors = Sayer, J.A. | title = Population ecology and response to cropping of a hippopotamus population in eastern Zambia | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0021-8901(197608)13%3A2%3C391%3APEARTC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-L | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1976 | journal = The Journal of Applied Ecology | page = 391-403}}</ref>

Hippos average 3.5 meters (11&nbsp;ft) long, 1.5 meters (5&nbsp;ft) tall at the shoulder. The range of hippopotamus sizes overlaps with the range of the [[White Rhinoceros]]; use of different metrics makes it unclear which is the largest land animal after [[elephant]]s.  Even though they are bulky animals, hippopotami can run faster than a human on land. Estimates of their running speed vary from 30&nbsp;km/h (18&nbsp;mph) to 40&nbsp;km/h (25&nbsp;mph), or even 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph). The hippo can maintain these higher speeds for only a few hundred meters or yards.<ref name="The Hippos"/>
[[Image:Hippo walking.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A bull hippo out of water during daylight, Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania.]]
A hippo's lifespan is typically 40 to 50 years.<ref name="The Hippos"/> Donna the Hippo, 56, is the oldest known hippo in captivity. She lives at the [[Mesker Park Zoo]] in [[Evansville, Indiana]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.evansvillecvb.org/media/index.tpl?ID=39&Display=Detail | title = Oldest Hippo Turns 55! | work = [[Mesker Park Zoo]] | date = 2006-07-12 | accessdate = 2007-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url = http://www.courierpress.com/news/2007/jul/12/celebrate-with-donna | title = Celebrate with Donna | work = [[Evansville Courier & Press]] | accessdate = 2007-07-15 | date = 2007-07-12}}</ref>

[[Image:HippoSkelLyd2.png|thumb|250px|A drawing of a hippopotamus skeleton.]]
The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of the skull. This allows them to be in the water with most of their body submerged in the waters and mud of [[tropics|tropical]] rivers to stay cool and prevent [[sunburn]].  Their general anatomical structure is an [[adaptation]] to their [[riparian]] lifestyle.  Their skeletal structure is graviportal, adapted to carrying the animals' enormous weight.  hippopotami have legs that are small, relative to other [[megafauna]], because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden.  Like other aquatic mammals, the hippopotamus has very little hair.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

Their skin is 4 centimeters (1.5&nbsp;in) thick, and accounts for 25% of their weight. For additional protection from the sun, their skin secretes a natural [[sunscreen]] substance which is red-colored.  The secretion is sometimes referred to as "blood sweat," but is neither blood nor sweat. This secretion is initially colorless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. Two distinct [[pigment]]s have been identified in the secretions, one red and one orange. The two pigments are highly [[acid|acidic compounds]]. They are known as ''red pigment hipposudoric acid'' and ''orange pigment norhipposudoric acid''. The red pigment was found to inhibit the growth of disease-causing [[bacteria]], lending credence to the theory that the secretion has an [[antibiotic]] effect. The [[Absorption (optics)|light absorption]] of both pigments peaks in the [[ultraviolet]] range, creating a sunscreen effect. All hippos, even those with different diets secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food is the source of the pigments. Instead, the animals may synthesize the pigments from [[Protein precursor|precursors]] such as the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]]. <ref>{{cite journal | author=Saikawa Y, Hashimoto K, Nakata M, Yoshihara M, Nagai K, Ida M, Komiya T | title=Pigment chemistry: the red sweat of the hippopotamus | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=429 | issue=6990 | year=2004 | pages=363 | id=PMID 15164051}}</ref>

==Distribution==
''Hippopotamus amphibius'' was widespread in [[North Africa]] and [[Europe]] before the last [[glaciation]] event, and it can live in colder climates provided the water does not freeze during winter. The species was common in [[Egypt]]'s [[Nile]] region until historic times but has since been extirpated. [[Pliny the Elder]] writes that, in his time, the best location in Egypt for capturing this animal was in the [[Sais, Egypt|Saite nome]];<ref name="Pliny"/> the animal could still be found along the Damietta branch after the Arab Conquest in [[639]].  Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of [[Uganda]], [[Sudan]], [[Somalia]], [[Kenya]], northern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]], west through [[Ghana]] to [[Gambia]], and also in [[Southern Africa]] ([[Botswana]], [[Republic of South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]]). A separate population exists in [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref name="The Hippos"/>

===Conservation status===
[[Image:Peter Paul Rubens 083.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''The Hippopotamus Hunt'' (1617), by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Evidence through genetic analysis suggests that common hippos in Africa experienced a marked population expansion during or after the Pleistocene Epoch, attributed to an increase in water bodies at the end of the era.  These findings have important conservation implications as Hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water.<ref name="Okello"/>  Hippos are also subject to unregulated or illegal [[poaching]].  In addition to addressing these common threats, the genetic diversity of hippos would need to be preserved to ensure the safety of the species. In May 2006 the hippopotamus was identified as a [[vulnerable species]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] drawn up by the [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN), with an estimated population of between 125,000 and 150,000 hippos, a decline of between 7 percent and 20 percent since the IUCN's 1996 study.<ref name="Redlist">{{IUCN2006|assessors=Lewison & Oliver|year=2005|id=10103|title=Hippopotamus amphibius|downloaded=[[11 May]] [[2006]]}} Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is vulnerable.</ref> 

The hippo population declined most dramatically in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref name="HippoHaven"/>  The population in [[Virunga National Park]] had dropped to 800 or 900 individuals from around 29,000 in the mid 1970s, raising concerns about the viability of that population.<ref name="BBC"/> The decline is attributed to the disruptions caused by the [[Second Congo War]].<ref name="BBC"/> Poachers are believed to be former [[Hutu]] rebels, poorly paid Congolese soldiers, and local militia groups.<ref name="BBC"/> Reasons for poaching include the belief that hippos are unintelligent, that they are a harm to society, and also for money.<ref name="Star"/> The sale of hippo meat is illegal, but black-market sales are difficult for [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] officers to track.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite news| title = DR Congo's hippos face extinction. | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4240420.stm | date = 2005-09-13 | accessdate = 2005-11-14 | work = [[BBC]]}}</ref><ref name="Star">{{Cite news | title = Congo's hippos fast disappearing | work = [[Toronto Star]] | accessdate = 2005-11-14 }}</ref>

==Behavior==
[[Image:Hippo mouth1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|An open mouth signals that the hippo feels threatened.]]
Hippos spend most of their days wallowing in the water or the mud, with the other members of their pod.  The water serves to keep their body temperature cool, and to keep their skin from drying out.  With the exception of eating, most of hippopotami's lives<U+2014>from childbirth, fighting with other hippos, and reproduction<U+2014>occurs in the water.

Hippos leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to 8 kilometers (5 mi), to graze on short grass, their main source of food. They spend four to five hours grazing and can consume 68 kilograms (150 lb) of grass each night.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.krugerpark.co.za/africa-hippopotamus.html | title = Hippopotamus | accessdate = 2007-06-18 | work = [[Kruger National Park]]}}</ref>  Like almost any herbivore, they will consume many other plants if presented with them, but their diet in nature consists almost entirely of grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants.<ref name="Grey"/>  Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating [[carrion]], usually close to the water.  There are other reports of meat-eating, and even [[cannibalism]] and [[predation]].<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Reports of carnivory by the common hippo Hippopotamus Amphibius | author = J.P. Dudley | journal = South African Journal of Wildlife Research | volume =  28 | issue = 2 | pages = 58-59}}</ref>  The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behavior or nutritional stress.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

The diet of hippos consists mostly of terrestrial grasses, but they spend most of their time in the water.  Most of their defecation occurs in the water, creating [[allochthonous]] deposits of organic matter along the river beds.  These deposits have an unclear ecological function.<ref name="Grey">{{Cite journal | title = Using Stable Isotope Analyses To Identify Allochthonous Inputs to Lake Naivasha Mediated Via the Hippopotamus Gut | url = http://openurl.ingenta.com/content?genre=article&issn=1025-6016&volume=38&issue=4&spage=245&epage=250

[[Image:Lightmatter hippo.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|A submerged hippo at the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Adult hippos typically resurface to breathe every 3<U+2013>5 minutes.]]
Adult hippos are not generally [[buoyant]]. When in deep water, they usually propel themselves by leaps, pushing off from the bottom. They move at speeds up to 8&nbsp;km/h (5 mph) in water. Young hippos are buoyant and more often move by swimming, propelling themselves with kicks of their back legs.  Adult hippos typically resurface to breathe every 4&ndash;6 minutes. The young have to breathe every two to three minutes.<ref name="The Hippos"/> The process of surfacing and breathing is automatic, and even a hippo sleeping underwater will rise and breathe without waking.  A hippo closes its nostrils when it submerges.  One hippo calf survived after being pushed out to sea during the [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and was rescued on a nearby sandy reef.<ref name="NPR">{{Cite news | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4754996 | title = A hippo and tortoise tale | date = 2005-07-17 | accessdate = 2007-06-18 | work = [[National Public Radio|NPR]]}}</ref>

===Social life===
Studying the interaction of male and female hippopotami has long been complicated by the fact that hippos are not [[sexually dimorphic]] and thus females and young males are almost indistinguishable in the field.<ref>{{Cite journal | journal = [[African Zoology]] | author = Beckwitt, R. | coauthors = Shea, J., Osborne, D., Krueger, S., and Barklow, W. | year = 2002 | title = A PCR-based method for sex identification in Hippopotamus amphibius | pages = 127-130}}</ref>  Although hippos like to lie in close proximity to each other, they do not seem to form social bonds except between mothers and daughters, and are not social animals.  The reason they huddle in close proximity is unknown.<ref name="The Hippos"/>  

[[Image:Curious_Young_Hippo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|It is difficult to identify the gender of hippos in the field, because all researchers can usually see are their backs, like with this pod in [[Tanzania]].]]
Hippopotami are territorial only in water, where a bull presides over a small stretch of river, on average 250 meters in length, and containing ten females.  The largest pods can contain up to 100 hippos.  Other bachelors are allowed in a bull's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward the bull.  The territories of hippos exist to establish mating rights.  Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by gender.  Bachelors will lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the bull on his own.  When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

Hippopotami appear to communicate verbally, through grunts and bellows, but the purpose of these vocalizations is unknown.  Hippos have the unique ability to hold their head partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; hippos above and under water will respond.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Low-frequency sounds and amphibious communication in Hippopotamus amphibious | url = http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JASMAN000115000005002555000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | author = William E. Barklow | year = 2004 | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 2555}}</ref>

===Reproduction===
Female hippos reach sexual maturity at 5 to 6 years of age and have a [[pregnancy (mammals)|gestation period]] of 8 months.  A study of [[endocrine system]]s revealed that female hippopotami may begin puberty as early as 3 or 4 years of age.<ref name="Endocrine">{{Cite journal | title = Endocrine patterns associated with reproduction in the Nile hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) as assessed by fecal progestagen analysis | journal = General and Comparative Endocrinology | Volume = 128 | issue = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 74-81 | author = Graham L.H. | coauthors = Reid K.; Webster T.; Richards M.; Joseph S.}}</ref>  Males reach maturity at around 7.5 years.

A study of hippopotamus reproductive behavior in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during the end of the wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter.  This is because of the female's [[estrous|oestrous cycle]]; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus [[spermatozoa]] is active year round.  Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring at the start of the wet season.<ref name="The Hippos"/>  After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.<ref name="Endocrine"/>

[[Image:Beware of hippopotamus.jpg|thumb|150px|Hippos can be rather dangerous to humans, as this sign from [[Kruger National Park]] notes.]]
Mating occurs in the water with the female submerged for most of the encounter, her head emerging periodically to draw breath.  Hippos are one of the few mammals that give birth under water, along with Cetaceans and [[Sirenia]]ns ([[manatee]]s and [[dugong]]s). Baby hippos are born underwater at a weight between 25 and 45&nbsp;kg (60<U+2013>110 lb) and an average length of around 127 cm (50 in) and must swim to the surface to take their first breath.  A mother typically gives birth to only one hippo, although twins occur at an unknown ratio.  The young often rest on their mothers' backs when in water that is too deep for them, and they swim underwater to suckle.  They also will suckle on land when the mother leaves the water.  [[Weaning]] starts between six and eight months after birth and most calves are fully weaned after a year.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

Hippos are considered [[k-selection|K-strategists]], meaning that they favor quality over quantity in their reproduction.  K-selection is the norm for large animals that produce few young at each birth.<ref name="The Hippos"/><ref name="Infanticide"/>

===Aggression===
Adult hippos are hostile toward [[crocodile]]s, which often live in the same pools and rivers as hippos. This is especially so when hippo calves are around. Hippos have been known to be aggressive towards humans, and it is often claimed that hippos are the deadliest animal in Africa; however, according to [[Smithsonian Magazine]], while the animal is very dangerous, reliable statistics for this are unavailable.<ref name="HippoHaven">{{cite news |url = http://www.smithsonianmagazine.com/issues/2006/january/hippos.php |title = Hippo Haven |work = [[Smithsonian Magazine]] |date = 2006-01-01 |accessdate = 2007-01-23 |language = English }}</ref>

To mark territory, hippos spin their tails while defecating to distribute their excrement over the greatest possible area.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/11/061110-poop-scoop_2.html National Geographic exhibit on different animals and their poop.]</ref> Hippos also urinate backwards (are retromingent), likely for the same reason. <ref>{{cite video|title=Nature's World: Africa's Lions and Wildebeests | url =http://dhd.discovery.com/schedule/bestof/nature.html | year=2002 | date =06-17 |publisher=[[Discovery HD Theater]]}}</ref>

Hippos rarely kill each other, even in territorial challenges.  Usually a territorial bull and a challenging bachelor will stop fighting when it is clear that one hippo is stronger.  When hippos become overpopulated, or when a habitat starts to shrink, bulls will sometimes attempt to kill infants; sometimes female hippos will kill the bulls to protect their infants, but neither behavior is common under normal conditions.<ref name="Infanticide">{{Cite journal | title = Infanticide in the hippopotamus: evidence for polygynous ungulates | author = Lewison, R | journal = [[Ethology Ecology & Evolution]] | volume = 10 | number = 3 | pages = 277-286. | year = 1998 | url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=ENV&recid=4419797&q=&uid=791069503&setcookie=yes}}

==Hippos and humans==

[[Image:Hippopotamus-polka-early1850s.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The cover of the Hippopotamus Polka.  The unlikely portrayal of dancing hippos was echoed in Disney's ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]''.]]
The earliest evidence of human interaction with hippos comes from rock paintings and engravings in the mountains of the central [[Sahara]].  One such drawing, dated 4,000<U+2013>5,000 years ago near [[Djanet]] in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer|Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains]], shows hippos being hunted.  Hippos were also well-known to the [[Pharoah]]s, where the hippo was recognized as a ferocious denizen of the [[Nile]].<ref name="The Hippos"/>  In [[Egyptian mythology]], the hippopotamus-headed [[Tawaret]], was a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth, because ancient Egyptians recognized the protective nature of a female hippopotamus toward her young.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Hart, George | title = A Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1986 | isbn = 0415059097}}</ref>

The hippopotamus has been known to historians since [[Classical antiquity]].  The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] described the hippopotamus in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' (written [[circa]] 440 BC) and the Roman Historian [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote about the hippopotamus in his encyclopedia ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' (written circa 77 AD).<ref>{{Cite book | title = [[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]] | author = [[Herodotus]] | chapter = Chapter 71, Book II | language = [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0016%2C001&query=2%3A71%3A1 English translation]}}</ref><ref name="Pliny">{{Cite book | title = [[Naturalis Historia]] | author = [[Pliny]] | chapter = Chapter 15, Book VIII | language = [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/8*.html Latin original] or [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/pliny8.html English translation] |}}</ref>

===Hippos in zoos===
Hippopotami have long been popular zoo animals.  The first zoo hippo in modern history was [[Obaysch]] who arrived at the [[London Zoo]] on May 25, 1850, where he attracted up to 10,000 visitors a day and inspired a popular song, the Hippopotamus Polka.<ref name="Mania">{{Cite journal | author = Root, N. J. | title = Victorian England<U+2019>s Hippomania. | journal = [[Natural History]] | volume = 103 | year = 1993 | pages = 34<U+2013>39}}</ref>

Since Obaysch, hippos have remained popular zoo animals.  In general, hippos breed well in captivity.  Their birth rates are lower than in the wild, but this is attributed to zoos not wanting to breed as many hippos as possible, since hippos are large and relatively expensive animals to maintain.<ref name="The Hippos">{{cite book |last=Eltringham |first=S.K. |title= The Hippos|year=1999 |publisher=Academic Press |location=London |isbn=085661131X |series= Poyser Natural History Series}}</ref><ref name="Mania"/>

Most hippos in zoos were born in captivity.  There are enough hippos in the international zoo system, that introducing further animals from the wild will be unnecessary if zoos cooperate to maintain the genetic diversity of the breeding stock.<ref name="The Hippos"/>

Like many zoo animals, hippos were traditionally displayed in concrete exhibits.  In the case of hippos, they usually had a pool of water and patch of grass.  In the 1980s, zoo designers increasingly designed exhibits that reflected the animals' native habitats.  The best known of these, the [[Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium]], features a 360,000 gallon pool for hippos.<ref name="Zoos">{{Cite news | title= No rms, jungle vu: a new group of "landscape-immersion" zoo designers are trying to break down visitors' sense of security by reminding them that wild animals really are wild. | work = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | date = December 1987 | author = Melissa Greene}}</ref> In 1987, researchers were able to tape, for the first time, an underwater birth (as in the wild) at the Toledo Zoo.  The exhibit was so popular that the hippos became the logo of the Toledo Zoo.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toledozoo.org/plantsanimals/pa_hippoquarium.html | title = Hippoquarium | publisher = [[Toledo Zoo]] | accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref>

===Hippos in popular culture===
Ever since [[Obaysch]] inspired the Hippopotamus Polka, hippos have been popular animals for their rotund appearance that many consider comical.<ref name="Mania"/>  Stories of hippos like [[Huberta, the hippopotamus|Huberta]] who became a celebrity in [[South Africa]] in the 1930s for trekking across the country;<ref>{{Cite book | title = Huberta Goes South, a Record of the Lone Trek of the Celebrated Zululand Hippopotamus | author = Chilvers, H.A. | year = 1931 | publisher = Gordon & Gotch | location = London}}</ref> or the tale of [[Owen and Mzee]], a hippo and tortoise who developed an intimate bond; have amused people who have bought hippo books, merchandise, and many a stuffed hippo toy.<ref name="NPR"/><ref>{{Cite book | title = Owen & Mzee; The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship | author = Isabella Hatkoff, Craig Hatkoff and Dr. Paula Kahumbu | publisher = [[Scholastic Press]] | location = [[New York, NY|New York]] | year = 2006}}</ref>  Hippos even inspired a popular board game, [[Hungry Hungry Hippos]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Childhood Trauma: Hungry Hungry Hippos | work = Newcastle Herald (Australia) | date = 2006-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = Fred Kroll, of Trouble and Hungry Hungry Hippos games, dead at 82 | work = [[Associated Press]] | date = 2003-08-05}}</ref>

Hippos have been popular cartoon characters, where their roly-poly frame is used for humorous effect.   In the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' featured a ballerina hippopotamus dancing to the opera, ''[[La Gioconda (opera)|La Gioconda]]''.<ref name="HippoHaven"/>  Other cartoon hippos have included [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s [[Peter Potamus]], the book and TV series ''[[George and Martha]]'', and [[Flavio and Marita]] on the ''[[Animaniacs]]''.
