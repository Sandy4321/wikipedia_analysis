"'''The Buddha of Suburbia'''" is the theme song to the [[The Buddha of Suburbia (television series)|BBC TV series]] of the same name, released by [[David Bowie]] in 1993. It was re-recorded with [[Lenny Kravitz]] for Bowie's album, also titled ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (soundtrack)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]'', and inspired by his musical score for the series. The single reached #35 in the [[UK singles chart]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=21450 |title=Chart Stats - David Bowie - The Buddha of Suburbia |accessdate={{Start date|2009|2|25|df=yes}}}}</ref>.

== Background ==
One of the few tracks from the series that was actually retained unchanged for the album, its nostalgic lyrics were matched by a sound that was something of a pastiche of Bowie's past work, while retaining a fresh sound. Two places in the song there are references to older Bowie songs, the guitar break from "[[Space Oddity (song)|Space Oddity]]" and the line "Zane, zane, zane, ouvre le chien" from "[[All the Madmen (song)|All the Madmen]]".

Confusingly, several different versions of the song were released, some with no differentiation in title.

Album track #1 ("Buddha of Suburbia") does not feature Lenny Kravitz.  Album track #10 does feature him, but is not titled any differently from album track #1, although he is created in the liner notes.

CD single track #4 is labelled "Buddha of Suburbia (Rock Mix)", but it is the same as album track #10.  Single track #1 is labelled just "Buddha of Suburbia" but does show "featuring Lenny Kravitz on guitar" in the credits.  A careful comparison shows that this track is primarily the same as album track #1, but has the ending section of album track #10 (featuring Lenny Kravitz) instead of the original ending from album track #1.

To add additional confusion, a couple of seconds of "noise" appear at the end of Track #1 on the album version.  It doesn't appear on the end of the song on any of the single versions of it and the 2007 remaster/reissue of the album moves it to the beginning of Track #2 instead.

This single was promoted by a video featuring Bowie performing the song while strolling around an English suburb, intercut with scenes from the series.

== Controversy ==
The song caused minor controversies on both sides of the Atlantic, with Radio 1 making an airplay edit to cover up the word "bullshit" in the lyric, and US networks re-edited the video to remove shots where Bowie was smoking a cigarette.
