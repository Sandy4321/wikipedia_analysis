'''''The Unexpected''''' was a [[DC Comics]] [[horror comic]] book, a continuation of ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]''. It ran 117 issues, #105-222, from 1968 to 1982. 

==Publication history==
Unlike the predecessor, it was more of a fantasy anthology at first, then turned into a weird/horror anthology in the style of ''[[House of Secrets]]'' and ''[[House of Mystery]]''. Its first "host" was [[The Mad Mod Witch]]. With issue #189 the series became a triple-sized [[Dollar Comic]], incorporating ''House of Secrets'' and ''[[The Witching Hour (DC Comics)|The Witching Hour]]''.  Each "Unexpected" story would always include the word in its last panel.  After the merge, this was only true of the ''Unexpected'' section; there would then be complete, ad-free issues of ''The Witching Hour'', hosted by its witches, and ''The House of Secrets'', hosted by [[Cain and Abel (comics)|Abel]].  ''The Witching Hour'' feature was alternated with ''Doorway to Nightmare'' for several issues.  With issue #198, the series was restored to standard size, and rather than three complete issues in one, there was one story each per issue.  ''The House of Secrets'' continued through issue #208, ''The Witching Hour'' continued to be an until issue #209 (April 1981), which incorporated the science fiction series, ''Time Warp''.

The only continuing series was [[Johnny Peril]], an adventure series which ran from issues #106-117. For issues #111-on, he was billed as an 'adventurer of the weird', as the comic changed. Johnny Peril would again appear in issues 200, 205-213. Johnny Peril had originally appeared in ''[[Sensation Comics]]'' #107-109, when it was retitled ''Sensation Mystery'' for issues #110-116. Some of his stories would be reprinted in ''Unexpected''.

The comic features "[[The Mad Mod Witch]]" (later known as "Fashion Thing" in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'') as a story narrator in #108-112, 114-116, 140, and 162, and "Judge Gallows" in #113, 118, 121, 125 and 133.  Judge Gallows would later appear in the final story arc of ''[[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]]''.

[[Madame Xanadu]] appeared in issues #190, 192, 194, and 195.
