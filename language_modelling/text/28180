The '''National September 11 Memorial & Museum''' (branded as '''9/11 Memorial''' and '''9/11 Memorial Museum''') is the principal memorial and museum commemorating the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001, which killed approximately 3,000 people, and the [[World Trade Center bombing|World Trade Center bombing of 1993]], which killed six.<ref>[http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/memorial_period.php Memorial. Period.] ''Under Construction''</ref> The memorial is located at the [[World Trade Center site]], on the former location of the [[World Trade Center|Twin Towers]], which were destroyed during the attacks. The World Trade Center Memorial Foundation was renamed the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center in 2007.<ref>{{cite news | title = 9/11 memorial tour to stop in Charleston | last = Westfeldt | first = Amy | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13968826.html | newspaper = The Charleston Gazette | publisher = McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via HighBeam Research (subscription required) | location = Charleston, WV | date = August 15, 2007 | accessdate =May 3, 2012 | quote = Previously known as the World Trade Center Memorial, the memorial's official name is now the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center. The memorial debuted a new logo and Internet address Tuesday. }}</ref>

The winner of the [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition]] was American architect [[Michael Arad]] of [[Handel Architects]], a New York- and San Francisco-based firm. Arad worked with landscape architecture firm Peter Walker and Partners on the design which calls for a forest of trees with two square pools in the center, where the [[World Trade Center|Twin Towers]] once stood.<ref>{{cite web|last=Handwerker |first=Haim |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/925885.html |title=The politics of remembering Ground Zero <U+2013> Haaretz <U+2013> Israel News |work=Haaretz |date=November 20, 2007 }}</ref>

In August 2006, the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation and the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] began heavy construction on the memorial and museum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schuerman |first=Matthew |url=http://www.observer.com/2007/memorial-name-changes-gets-longer |title=Trade Center Memorial Name Changes, Gets Longer &#124; The New York Observer |publisher=Observer.com }}</ref> The design is consistent with the original [[Daniel Libeskind]] master plan that called for the memorial to be 30&nbsp;feet below street level (originally 70&nbsp;feet) in a [[piazza]]. The design was the only finalist to throw out Libeskind's requirement that buildings overhang the footprints.

A memorial was planned in the immediate aftermath of the attacks and destruction of the [[World Trade Center]] to remember both the victims and those involved in rescue. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the [[World Trade Center]] is a non-profit corporation with the mission to raise funds for, program, own and operate the memorial and museum at the [[World Trade Center site]]. On September 11, 2011, a dedication ceremony was held at the memorial, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the attacks. The memorial officially opened to the public on September 12, 2011, while the museum has yet to open. Three months after opening, the memorial had been seen by over 1 million visitors.<ref>{{cite news|title=Visitors to New York's 9/11 memorial top 1 million|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/29/us/new-york-911-memorial/|accessdate=December 29, 2011|newspaper=CNN|date=December 29, 2011|author=CNN Wire Staff}}</ref> In 2012, Tuesday's Children, a non-profit family service organization that has made a commitment to individuals directly impacted by 9/11 and to those who have lost loved ones to terrorism around the globe, has partnered with the 9/11 Memorial to offer private tours to family members of 9/11 victims and First Responders.

==Organization==

=== National tour===
In September 2007, the Memorial & Museum launched a four-month national awareness tour that stopped at 25 cities in 25 states where thousands participated in the tour<U+2019>s activities.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SEPTEMBER 11 MEMORIAL & MUSEUM REACHES 25th CITY ON NATIONAL TOUR|url=http://www.911memorial.org/sites/all/files/DocServer/Tribute_Exhibition_Release-Tampa.pdf|publisher=National September 11 Memorial and Museum at the World Trade Center|accessdate=September 13, 2012|date=14|month=December|year=2007}}</ref> The tour began at Finlay Park in Columbia, South Carolina and ended at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. Highlights from the tour included: an exhibition of photographs, artifacts from the site and a short film featuring firsthand accounts from individuals who had experienced 9/11 directly. At the opening ceremony in South Carolina, White Knoll Middle School<U+2019>s students, who raised more than half a million dollars in 2001 to buy a new truck for New York City's Fire Department, were honored. Also at the ceremony, retired New York City Police Officer Marcelo Pevida presented the City of Columbia with an American flag that had flown over Ground Zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officer.com/web/online/Special-Coverage--9-11-01-Six-Years-After/National-911-Memorial-and-Museum-Tour-Kicks-Off-in-South-Carolina/24$37811|title= |title=National 9/11 Memorial & Museum Tour Kicks Off in South Carolina |publisher=Officer.com |date=October 5, 2012 }}</ref> As the main attraction of the 2007 National Tour, steel beams that would later be used in the construction of the memorial were made available to visitors who wanted to sign their names onto it.<ref>{{cite web|title=National September 11 Memorial & Museum Begins National Tour of Tribute Exhibition to Raise Awareness and Support|url=http://www.911memorial.org/sites/all/files/DocServer/September_11th_Tribute_Exhibition_Release__post_opening_.pdf|publisher=National September 11 Memorial|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>

=== Fundraising ===
The budget for the Memorial and Museum project, funded by private and public funds, is $530 million, with an additional $80 million grant from New York State for the construction of the museum pavilion. Of the $530 million, $350 million has been raised by the National September 11 Memorial & Museum through private donations and the remainder consists of federal grants through the LMDC.{{Citation needed|reason=Time-specific amounts, should have link to reference doc as of specific dates|date=March 2012}}

====Cobblestone campaign====
The National September 11 Memorial & Museum operates a "cobblestone campaign" where a contributor can sponsor a cobblestone or paver that will line the Memorial Plaza. The names of donors appear on the Memorial's website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cobblestone Donors|url=http://www.911memorial.org/cobblestone-donors|publisher=National September 11 Memorial|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref> Once the Memorial is completed, a donor will be able to locate his/her cobblestone or paver by entering his/her name at a kiosk on the Memorial Plaza.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sponsor a Cobblestone|url=http://www.911memorial.org/sponsor-cobblestone-0|publisher=National September 11 Memorial|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>

====Federal legislation====
Sen. Daniel Inouye from Hawaii has proposed S.1537 (National September 11 Memorial and Museum Act of 2011) which would provide $20 million in Federal funds toward the Memorial's annual operating budget. The legislation was presented to the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources on October 19, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.+1537: |title=Bill Text 112th Congress (2011<U+2013>2012) S.1537.IS |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov }}</ref> This is approximately one third of the Memorial's total annual operating budget.

In addition to provide Federal funding, S.1537 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to accept a donation by the Board of Directors of title to the National September 11 Memorial, contingent on agreement by the Board of Directors, the governors of both New York and New Jersey, the Mayor of New York, and the Secretary of the Interior. On October 19, 2011, William D. Shaddox of the National Park Service testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and raised concerns regarding the ability of the National Park Service to provide the funds required by S.1537. It was also noted that there is no precedent for the NPS to hold title to a property over which it does not also have operational and administrative control, as S.1537 would require.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statement of William D. Shaddox|url=http://www.doi.gov/ocl/2006/S1537_101911.htm|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Memorial history==

===Founding===

Formerly the [[World Trade Center]] Memorial Foundation, Inc., the National September 11 Memorial & Museum was formed as a [[501(c)|501(c)(3)]] non-profit corporation to raise funds and manage the planning and construction of the memorial. Its board of directors had its inaugural meeting on January 4, 2005. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum reached its first phase capital fundraising goal of US$350 million in April 2008. This money, along with additional amounts raised, will be used to build the memorial and museum and to create an endowment for the museum.

===Design competition===
{{main|World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition}}
In 2003, the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] launched an [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition|international competition]] to design a memorial at the World Trade Center site to commemorate the lives lost in the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].

Individuals and teams from around the world contributed [[World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition|design proposals]].

On November 19, 2003, the thirteen-member jury&nbsp;<U+2013> which included [[Maya Lin]], designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and deputy mayor [[Patricia Harris]]&nbsp;<U+2013> selected eight finalists. "Reflecting Absence" was chosen as the winning design on January 6, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.911memorial.org/design-competition |title=National September 11 Memorial & Museum |publisher=911memorial.org }}</ref> On January 14, 2004, the final design for the World Trade Center site memorial was revealed in a press conference at [[Federal Hall]] in New York.

====Mission statement====
The non-profit corporation that will manage the memorial states its goals as the following:
<br />
{{Quote box
| quote  =''The Memorial Mission:''
* Remember and honor the thousands of innocent men, women, and children murdered by terrorists in the horrific attacks of [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|February 26, 1993]] and [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].
* Respect this place made sacred through tragic loss.
* Recognize the endurance of those who survived, the courage of those who risked their lives to save others, and the compassion of all who supported us in our darkest hours.

=== Fundraising ===
The Foundation has fundraising responsibilities because of the tasks assigned to it by the [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation]] (LMDC). The Foundation is to own, operate and finance:
* National September 11 Memorial, the formal "Reflecting Absence" memorial designed by [[Michael Arad]] and [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker]].
* National September 11 Memorial Museum, a museum to tell the story of the events.
[[John C. Whitehead]] was chairman of both [[Lower Manhattan Development Corporation|LMDC]] and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. He announced his resignation in May 2006. Former LMDC President Kevin Rampe will become chairman of the LMDC. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg replaced Whitehead as chairman of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum.

==Memorial==

=== Memorial design ===

In January 2004, the design, ''Reflecting Absence,'' by architect Michael Arad and landscape architect Peter Walker was selected as the winner of the LMDC's design competition that had 5,201 entrants from 63 nations.

Two pools with the largest manmade waterfalls in the United States cascading down their sides are located within the footprints of the Twin Towers. Each pool is {{convert|1|acre|m2|sing=on}}, and together they are intended to symbolize the loss of life and the physical void left by the terrorist attacks. The sound of the water falling is supposed to drown out the sounds of the city, making the site a contemplative sanctuary. Almost 400 [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweet gum]] and [[Quercus bicolor|swamp white oak]] trees fill the remaining {{convert|6|acre|m2}} of the Memorial Plaza, furthering the reflective nature of the site.<ref>[http://www.national911memorial.org/site/PageServer?pagename=building_home National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Build the Memorial<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

In addition, cutting-edge pedestrian simulations were conducted to test the design of the memorial site.  The pedestrian modeling software Legion was used to simulate how visitors would utilize the space, and the design was subsequently tweaked to prevent potential bottlenecks.<ref>[http://www.cssnationaldialog.org/documents/NewBrunswick/CSS-National-Dialog-World-Trade-Center-.pdf Pedestrian Simulation Modeling World Trade Center Memorial] ''CSS National Dialog''</ref>

====Arrangement of the victims<U+2019> names====
The names of 2,983 victims are inscribed on 76 bronze plates attached to the parapet walls that form the edges of the Memorial pools.<ref name=names-esquire>{{cite web|last=Raab|first=Scott|title=The Memorial|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/world-trade-center-memorial-0911-2|work=Esquire|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref> This includes the names of 2,977 victims who were killed in the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City, Arlington, Virginia, and  Pennsylvania, as well as the names of six victims who were killed in the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|February 1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. The names are arranged according to a process and algorithm which was used to created "meaningful adjacencies," based on "relationship" details which include proximity at the time of the attacks, company or organization affiliations for those who worked at the World Trade Center or Pentagon, and approximately 1,200 requests from family members. Software developed by [http://localprojects.net/project/911-memorial-guide/ Local Projects] was used to implement this arrangement.<ref name=names-sci-amer>{{cite web|last=Matson|first=John|title=Commemorative Calculus: How an Algorithm Helped Arrange the Names on the 9/11 Memorial|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=september-11-memorial|work=Scientific American|accessdate=March 25, 2012}}</ref>

As a result of this process, the names of the victims who were in the North Tower (WTC 1); passengers or crew of [[American Airlines Flight 11]] (which hit the North Tower) and victims of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are located around the perimeter of the North Pool. The names of the victims who were in the South Tower (WTC 2); passengers or crew of [[United Airlines Flight 175]] (which hit the South Tower); victims who were in the immediate vicinity of the Twin Towers; first responders who died during rescue operations; passengers or crew of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] (which crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania) and [[American Airlines Flight 77]] (which hit the Pentagon); and the victims who were at the Pentagon are located around the perimeter of the South Pool.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blais|first=Allison|title=A Place of Remembrance|year=2011|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-1-4262-0807-2|page=180|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/remembering-9-11/place-of-remembrance/}}</ref> It was decided that the names of companies would not be included. However, company employees and their visitors are listed together. Passengers of the four flights are listed together under their flight numbers, and first responders are listed together with their units.

The process for arranging names was finalized in an agreement reached in 2006, and replaced an earlier plan to arrange the names randomly.

===Memorial construction===

On March 13, 2006, construction workers arrived at the WTC site to commence work on the Reflecting Absence design. On that same day, relatives of the victims and other concerned citizens gathered to protest the new memorial, stating that the memorial should be built above ground. The president of the memorial foundation, however, stated that family members were consulted and formed a consensus in favor of the current design, and that work will continue as planned.<ref>{{cite news|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/newyork/am-wtc0313,0,7984990.story?coll=ny-top-headlines|title=WTC memorial construction underway|last=Perez|first=Luis|date=March 14, 2006}} {{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4800398.stm|title=Work commences on 9/11 memorial|author=Laura Trevelyan|authorlink=Laura Trevelyan| date=March 13, 2006 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>

In May 2006, it was disclosed that the estimated construction costs for the Memorial had risen to over US$1 billion.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian (UK)|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-5800493,00.html|title=Sept. 11 Memorial Cost Estimate Rises|author=Amy Westfeldt|date=May 6, 2006 | location=London}} {{dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=July 2008}}
{{bquote|Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] said the costs of building the Sept. 11 memorial are skyrocketing and must be capped at $500 million.

'There's just not an unlimited amount of money that we can spend on a memorial,' Bloomberg said. Any figure higher than $500&nbsp;million to build the memorial to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks would be "inappropriate", even if the design has to be changed, he said.'}}

In 2006, at the request of Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, builder Frank Sciame performed a month-long analysis, which considered input from victims' families, the Lower Manhattan business and residential communities, members of the memorial jury, architects and others. The analysis recommended design changes that kept the memorial and museum within the $500&nbsp;million budget.

In July 2010, the first shipments of soil arrived at the memorial site. In August 2010, workers from Kelco Construction, Inc. of Commack, NY started to plant trees on the memorial plaza. The trees, all swamp white oaks, can reach 60 to 80 feet at maturity, live as long as 300 to 350 years, and are golden-leafed in the fall.

In November 2010, workers started testing the north pool's waterfall. Construction progressed significantly through the spring of 2011. In March 2011, the installation of glass panels on the museum pavilion's fa<U+00E7>ade began, and in May 2011, workers started testing the south pool's waterfall. Most of the memorial was finished in time for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, with the museum slated for completion one year later. By September 2, 2011, more than 242 trees had been planted at the site, while 8 more were planted before the memorial opened. By then, both pools had been completed, and were tested daily to ensure that the waterfalls were working. On September 12, 2011, one day after the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the memorial officially opened to the public, operating under a set of lengthy rules and regulations approved by the Board of Directors. The period estimated to extend from September 11, 2011 to December 31, 2013, is known as the "Interim Operating Period," during which time the memorial will be surrounded by construction of the neighboring World Trade Center projects.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.911memorial.org/visitor-rules-and-regulations |title=Visitor Rules and Regulations |author=National September 11 Memorial & Museum |work=911memorial.org |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}</ref>
The museum, originally planned to be completed by September 2012, marking the 11th anniversary of the [[September 11th attacks]], was expected to be completed sometime later due to a financial dispute with the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] which had temporarily halted construction of the museum but now, the construction had resumed as of March 30, 2012.<ref name="Musuem Construction Updates" />

==== Survivor Tree ====
[[File:The Survivor Tree at the National September 11 Memorial.jpg|thumb|The Survivor Tree (night, winter)]]
According to Joe Daniels, President of the memorial, the Survivor Tree is "a key element of the memorial plaza's landscape."<ref name="downtownexpress-survivortree">{{cite web|last=Reynolds|first=Aline|title=One survivor from 9/11 returns home, for good|url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/de_401/onesurvivor.html|work=downtown express|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}</ref>

The tree is a [[Callery Pear|callery pear]] tree.

In November 2001, the tree was brought by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] to the [[Arthur Ross (philanthropist)|Arthur Ross]] Nursery in [[Van Cortlandt Park]] in the Bronx to be cared for.<ref name=downtownexpress-survivortree /> The nursery's manager, Robert Zappala, said the tree was covered in ash when it arrived, and it was replanted in the Bronx on November 11, 2001.<ref name=nyt-survivortree>{{cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David|title=A 9/11 Survivor Blossoms in the Bronx|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/30/a-911-survivor-blossoms-in-the-bronx/|work=City Room|accessdate=March 17, 2012|date=April 30, 2009}}</ref> At the time, Richard Cabo (the tree's primary caretaker until it was replanted at the memorial) did not expect the tree to survive.<ref name=dnainfo-survivortree />

In March 2010, while still under the care of the Bronx nursery, the tree was uprooted during a storm. It was replanted and suffered no significant damage.<ref name="starledger-survivortree">{{cite web|last=Strunsky|first=Steve|title=Despite Hurricane Irene, 9/11 survivor tree emerges unscathed|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/08/despite_hurricane_irene_911_su.html|work=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}</ref>

==The Museum at the September 11 Memorial==

=== Museum design ===
[[File:September 11th Memorial and Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The 9/11 Museum and the North Pool]]
Designed by [[Davis Brody Bond, LLP]], the museum will be located approximately {{convert|70|ft|m}} below ground, and will be accessed through an entry pavilion designed by [[Sn<U+00F8>hetta (company)|Sn<U+00F8>hetta]], a [[Norway|Norwegian]] architectural firm.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Erlanger |title=Again in Norway, Events Provide Test for a King<U+2019>s Mettle |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/world/europe/king-harald-of-norway-proves-mettle-with-response-to-july-22-deaths.html?partner=rss&emc=rss |work=New York Times |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}</ref> The entry pavilion comprises a [[deconstructivist]] design, making it resemble a partially collapsed building which mirrors the attacks of 9/11. Two of the original tridents from the Twin Towers will be located in this pavilion. One of the walls of the underground museum will be an exposed side of the [[slurry wall]], which is the retaining wall that holds back the Hudson River and that had remained un-breached during and after September 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.national911memorial.org/site/PageServer?pagename=building_home |title=National September 11 Memorial & Museum, Build the Memorial |publisher=National911memorial.org }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E7DC133BF930A15752C1A9659C8B63 |title= The World; Ahead of Any 9/11 Memorial, a Wall Bears Witness |author=James Glanz | date=November 23, 2003 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref>

===Museum construction===
The Museum is going to be an underground museum which will have some of the artifacts of 9/11/2001, and pieces of steel from the Twin Towers; like the final steel, which was the last piece of steel to leave Ground Zero in May 2002. The Museum is being built on top of the former location of the Sphere, a fountain and statue which stood between the twin towers, that was miraculously intact after the Sep 11th 2001 attacks. It was since moved to be displayed at Battery Park, and the memorial building will sit where the fountain once stood. The estimated completion of the museum was to be on or around September 11, 2012.  As of December 2011, the construction of the museum has come to a temporary halt. According to the Associated Press, there are some financial disputes between the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the National September 11 Memorial and Museum foundation, deciding on who should be responsible for infrastructure costs.  As of March 13, 2012, active discussions regarding to the issue are already underway and construction has resumed.<ref name="Musuem Construction Updates">{{cite web|title=Lower Manhattan: National Sep. 11 Memorial and Museum Construction Updates|url=http://www.lowermanhattan.info/construction/project_updates/world_trade_center_memorial_93699.aspx|publisher=Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center|accessdate=3 February 2013}}</ref>

== Withdrawn proposals ==
Two centers were proposed and withdrawn from the World Trade Center Memorial plan in 2005:
* The [[International Freedom Center]]&nbsp;<U+2013> a "[[think tank]]" which was intended to draw attention to the battles for freedom through the ages.  World Trade Center Memorial Foundation member [[Deborah Burlingame]] wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that the center would have a mission that had nothing to do directly with the events of September 11 and could potentially criticize American policies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006791|author=Debra Burlingame|work=Wall Street Journal|title=The Great Ground Zero Heist|date=June 8, 2005}}</ref> Blogs and commentators heavily criticized the center until Governor [[George Pataki]] withdrew support for it.
* The [[Drawing Center]] Art Gallery at the World Trade Center&nbsp;<U+2013> Plans called for the Freedom Center to share its space with the Drawing Center in a building called the "Cultural Center."  The ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' ran a series of articles questioning whether its exhibits would be appropriate at Ground Zero based on the gallery's previous exhibits in its small [[SoHo]] quarters.

== Other 9/11 memorials ==
Aside from the memorial constructed at [[Ground zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]], there are many other memorials built by various communities and municipalities throughout the United States. Many of these memorials are built around a remnant of steel from the destroyed towers. These remnants have been donated by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] through a program that has distributed more than 1,000 pieces of World Trade Center steel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegazette.com/tag/port-authority-of-new-york-and-new-jersey/ |title=World Trade Center steel to be part of Cedar Rapids 9/11 ceremony |publisher=The Gazette |date=September 9, 2011 }}</ref>
