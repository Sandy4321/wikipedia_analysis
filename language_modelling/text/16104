The Chesapeake Bay Foundation<U+2019>s (CBF) '''Brock Environmental Center''' is located on the banks of the [[Lynnhaven River]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. It is designed to meet the highest environmental standards in accordance with [[U.S. Green Building Council| The U.S. Green Building Council<U+2019>s]] [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] and the [[Living Building Challenge]]. Home to CBF<U+2019>s Hampton Roads staff and local conservation group, Lynnhaven River NOW, the Brock Center will benefit the larger public with spaces indoors and out for community and student groups.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Komp|first1=Catherine|title=New Model For Green Building Opens In Virginia Beach|url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/new-model-green-building-opens-virginia-beach|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=NPR|date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

==Background==
===Pleasure House Point===
Pleasure House Point is a 118-acre peninsula on the [[Lynnhaven River]] in Virginia Beach at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. Developers purchased the land and planned to build <U+201C>Indigo Dunes,<U+201D> a development of more than 1,100 new high-rise condos and townhouses.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Christy|title=Rethinking Coastal Development in Virginia Beach|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/14/rethinking-coastal-development-in-virginia-beach/|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=Daily Caller|date=14 November 2014}}</ref> When the housing market collapsed in 2008, the building plans came to a halt, and the bank foreclosed on the property.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hixenbaugh|first1=Mike|title=Virginia Beach Deal Preserves A Slice of Nature|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2012/03/virginia-beach-deal-preserves-slice-nature|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=PilotOnline.com|date=14 March 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, The Chesapeake Bay Foundation partnered with the City of Virginia Beach, the Trust for Public Land, and the local community to buy Pleasure House Point for $13 million, preserving it for recreation and education. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Forget|first1=Karen|title=Oyster Restoration Committee|url=http://www.lynnhavenrivernow.org/files/pages/LYNN-20252-SummrNews_12%20(2).pdf|website=www.lynnhavenrivernow.org|publisher=LynnHaven River Now|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation bought a small corner of the property to build the Brock Environmental Center. The building takes its name from Virginia Beach philanthropist Dollar Tree founder Macon Brock and his wife Joan.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Luzzatto|first1=Donald|title=Building A Seaside Future|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2014/11/building-seaside-future|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=PilotOnline.com|date=9 November 2014}}</ref>

===Living Building Challenge===
The Living Building Challenge is the highest standard of certification for energy efficient, environmentally smart design and construction.  The Challenge is comprised of seven performance categories called Petals: Place, Water, Energy, Health and Happiness, Materials, Equity, and Beauty. <ref>{{cite web|title=Living Building Challenge|url=http://living-future.org/lbc|website=www.Living-future.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

The Chesapeake Bay Foundation expects that the center will be LEED-Platinum certified and that it will meet the Living Building Challenge certification. This rare designation means the building has a [[Zero-energy building|net-zero]] impact on the environment even after a full year of operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making of a Green Building|url=http://www.cbf.org/about-cbf/offices-operations/brock-center-about/making-of-a-green-building--review-only|website=www.cbf.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

==Design and Construction==
===Energy Independence===
Rooftop [[photovoltaics|photo-voltaic panels]] produce approximately 60 percent of the Brock Environmental Center<U+2019>s energy needs. Two residential-scale 10-kilowatt [[wind turbines]] provide the additional 40 percent of energy. [[Geothermal energy|Geothermal wells]] take advantage of the earth<U+2019>s constant 54-degree temperature and extract warm air in the winter and cool air in the summer and circulate it through the building with a high-efficiency HVAC.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making of a Green Building|url=http://www.cbf.org/about-cbf/offices-operations/brock-center-about/making-of-a-green-building--review-only|website=www.cbf.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

As a result of other energy efficient and conservation design elements, the building uses 80% less energy than a typical building its size.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Komp|first1=Catherine|title=New Model For Green Building Opens In Virginia Beach|url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/new-model-green-building-opens-virginia-beach|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=NPR|date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

The building is positioned to receive maximum southern exposure for warmth and to receive natural ventilation from the prevailing winds. Exterior walls, floors, and roof insulation are designed to reduce energy demands by maximizing the building<U+2019>s insulation.

===Water Independence===
Two 1,600 gallon [[rainwater tank|rain cisterns]] and a filtering system make the '''Brock Environmental Center''' the first project in the continental United States to receive a commercial permit for drinking filtered rainwater in accordance with the federal [[drinking water]] requirements. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Marks|first1=Josh|title=CBF<U+2019>s Brock Environmental Center Will Soon Be the Most Sustainable Building in Virginia|url=http://inhabitat.com/cbfs-brock-environmental-center-will-soon-be-the-most-sustainable-building-in-virginia/brock_gallery_1/?extend=1|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=Inhabitat|date=7 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Megan|title=Creating One of the World<U+2019>s Greenest Buildings|url=http://blog.usa.skanska.com/creating-one-of-the-worlds-greenest-buildings/|website=http://blog.usa.skanska.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=CUTTING-EDGE ENVIRONMENTAL CENTER OPENS AT PLEASURE HOUSE POINT IN VIRGINIA BEACH|url=http://outdoors.blogs.timesdispatch.com/2014/11/20/cutting-edge-environmental-center-opens-pleasure-house-point-virginia-beach/|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=Times Dispatch|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>   

The [[composting toilet|toilets]] are composting waterless units that turn human waste into usable organic material. Rain gardens will capture and filter extra runoff, and a special [[graywater]] garden will cleanse graywater (wastewater generated from sinks and showers). <ref>{{cite news|last1=Komp|first1=Catherine|title=New Model For Green Building Opens In Virginia Beach|url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/new-model-green-building-opens-virginia-beach|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=NPR|date=4 December 2014}}</ref>

===Materials===
To meet the Living Building Challenge, designers did not use any <U+201C>Red List<U+201D> materials that include chemicals and materials considered harmful to humans and the environment. Materials and chemicals listed on the Living Building Challenge<U+2019>s Red List include polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and halogenated flame retardants, among others. <ref>{{cite web|title=Making of a Green Building|url=http://www.cbf.org/about-cbf/offices-operations/brock-center-about/making-of-a-green-building--review-only|website=www.cbf.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>

The builders also worked with the community to use reclaimed and salvaged materials such as sinks, doors, mirrors, counters, cabinets, floor boards, used bike racks, student art tables, and old wood paneling. Supplies came from sources throughout the community including old office buildings, school houses, and a local parks department. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Everett|first1=Christy|title=Dumpster Diving to Save the Chesapeake Bay|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christy-everett/dumpster-diving-to-save-t_b_5968010.html|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=13 October 2014}}</ref>

==Use of Building==
===Education Center===
The Brock Environmental Center is home base for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation<U+2019>s outdoor field education program serving Hampton Roads students and teachers. According to CBF "Our courses combine many academic disciplines - [[earth science]], [[biology]], [[history]], [[art]], English/writing, [[math]], [[chemistry]], [[civics]], [[economics]], [[government]], and responsible citizenship. As a result, students become exceptionally informed and inspired, valuing the bay and its watershed as a living, connected system."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Luzzatto|first1=Donald|title=Building a Seaside Future|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2014/11/building-seaside-future|accessdate=15 January 2015|work=PilotOnline|date=9 November 2014}}</ref> Pleasure House Point is an active demonstration site for important and relevant restoration projects, including oyster, wetland, and other habitat restoration, as well as water quality improvement initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pleasure House Point Natural Area|url=http://www.vbgov.com/government/departments/parks-recreation/parks-trails/natural-areas/Pages/pleasure-house-point.aspx|website=www.vbgov.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref> By engaging in outdoor educational experiences in natural areas and on waterways, program participants can better understand the Chesapeake Bay.<ref>{{cite web|title=Washington-Lee High School<U+2019>s Chesapeake Bay Trip Featured on Green Scene|url=http://www.apsva.us//site/Default.aspx?PageID=27888|website=www.apsva.us|publisher=Arlington Public Schools|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>
