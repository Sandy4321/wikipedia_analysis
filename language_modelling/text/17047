"'''Daddy'''" is a song recorded by [[:wikt:America|America]]n [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] for her first solo album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]'' (2003). It was composed by Knowles as well as [[Mark Batson]]. The song was not originally intended to be featured on the final track-listing of the album. Knowles was able to record the song as the release date of her debut album had been postponed. "Daddy" was only released to US [[iTunes Store]] as a promotional single on June 3, 2003 through [[Columbia Records]].

Knowles explained that the song's development was motivated by the devotion and the loyalty her father/[[Talent manager|manager]], [[Mathew Knowles]] has towards his family members. Many of the songs on the album examine aspects of relationships. However, "Daddy" was considered to be an element analyzing the kinship ties between a father and his offspring from a different and more powerful perspective. Music critics, who generally received the song with positive reception, commented that the song was a way for Knowles to pay tribute to her father.

Concering the conception of "Daddy", Knowles told [[MTV News]]:
{{cquote|"My mother and father have been together for 23, 24 years, and I've seen them go through a lot.

"Daddy" is a nearly five-minute long<ref name="rol"/> [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song.<ref name="ign"/> The first verse of the song begins with Knowles reminiscing about the times she and her father/[[Talent manager|manager]], [[Mathew Knowles]] shared as a child and through her adolescence.<ref name="about"/> She sings about wanting to be with a man who has similar qualities as her father.<ref name="mtv">{{Cite web |last=Moss |first=Correy |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: Genuinely In Love - Part 2 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_062703/index2.jhtml |publisher=[[MTV News]].

==Critical reception==
Mark Edward Nero of [[About.com]] stated that "Daddy" was probably written specifically for the [[soundtrack album]] of ''[[Daddy's Little Girls]]'' and that it may even "play a part in a pivotal scene." Making reference to Knowles long-time relationship with Jay-Z and then recent rumors about them possibly getting married, Nero added that the song might leave several numerous fans wondering what could happen next.<ref name="about"/> Marc Anthony Neal of the international [[Online magazine|webzine]] [[PopMatters]] considered "Daddy" to be the "most affecting song on ''Dangerously in Love''."<ref name="pop">{{Cite web |last=Neal |first=Marc Anthony |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: Dangerously in Love |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/b/beyonce-dangerously.shtml |work=''[[PopMatters]]'' |date=July 11, 2003 |accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref> He went on writing that the song is an extraordinary tribute to her father Mathew Knowles, stating that Knowles "embraces [...] the man that has helped take the kind of artistic leap that ''Dangerously in Love'' represents." He ended up by adding that " [...] By the time listeners get to the fifteenth and final track, they will have been so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Beyonc<U+00E9>'s performance throughout, that 'Daddy' seems less corny [...]" but it is in this song that she finally accepts the state of being a woman, rather than a girl.<ref name="pop"/> 

Anthony DeCurtis of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that the album, which starts with "[a] cauldron of energy" on "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]" (2003), ends by contrast with "Daddy" which he described as a five-minute tribute to her manager-father, and considered to be "an anthology of vocal and lyrical cliches."<ref name="rol">{{Cite web |last=DeCurtis |first=Anthony |title=Album Reviews: Dangerously in Love |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/7733/38096 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Jann Wenner]] |accessdate=March 1, 2011 |date=July 10, 2003}}</ref> [[MTV News]] wrote that "Daddy" is different from the other relationship songs on ''Dangerously in Love'', and added that it has a powerful message.<ref name="mtv"/> By contrast, Allison Stewart of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called "Daddy" a "creepy bonus track".<ref name="Stewart">Stewart, Allison.
