'''Alexander Ernest Stevenson''' ([[August 9]] [[1912]] [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]] <U+2013> 1985) was an Irish [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] who played for both [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. As an international, Stevenson also played for both Ireland teams - the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]] and the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]]. Stevenson is the only footballer to have played for both the FAI XI and Rangers and is one of only three players born in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] to play for the club. The other two were [[Alex Craig]] and [[James Lowry McAuley]].

==Club career==
===Early years===
Stevenson began his career with [[Dolphin F.C. (Dublin)|Dolphins]] in the [[Football League of Ireland|League of Ireland]]. In 1932 he helped them reach the final of the [[FAI Cup]] where they lost 1-0 to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. Shortly afterwards, on May 8 1932, aged 19 and while still a Dolphins player, he made his debut for the [[Irish Free State national football team|FAI XI]] in a 2-0 away win against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. In August 1932 he signed for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] after being spotted by [[Arthur Dixon (1920s footballer)|Arthur Dixon]], a club coach. As part of the transfer deal Rangers played Dolphins in a friendly at [[Dalymount Park]] in 1933. Stevenson spent just a season and a half at Rangers. Although he made just 12 appearances in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]], he scored 7 goals and developed a reputation as a highly intelligent player.  While at Rangers, Stevenson also made his debut for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]] and he helped the club win the [[Scottish football champions|Division One]] title during the [[1933-34 in Scottish football#Scottish_League_Division_One|1933-34]] season.

===Everton===
In January 1934 Stevenson signed for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a fee of <U+00A3>37,000 and made his debut for the club against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] the following month. He remains one of [[Everton F.C.|Everton<U+2019>s]] all-time [[Everton F.C. records|top goalscorers]]. He was also a great supplier of goals, first to [[Dixie Dean]] and then to [[Tommy Lawton]] and he formed an excellent understanding with fellow [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Irish]] international [[Jackie Coulter]] on the left wing. In [[1938-39 in English football#First_Division|1939]], together with Lawton,  [[Joe Mercer]] and [[T. G. Jones|Tommy G. Jones]] he was a member of the Everton team that won the last [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title before the start of the [[Second World War]]. During this campaign he scored 10 goals in 36 games. 

During the war, while continuing to play for Everton, Stevenson also enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. Between 1939 and 1946 he made 202 appearances and scored 89 goals for Everton in wartime regional leagues. One of the highlights of his wartime career came on June 1 1940 when he scored a hat-trick in the last five minutes of a game against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. As well as playing for Everton, he also turned out as a guest for both [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]]. After the war Stevenson played in an Everton team that also included fellow [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|Irish]] internationals [[Peter Farrell]], [[Tommy Eglington]] and [[Peter Corr]] and future team manager [[Harry Catterick]]. By the time he finished his career with the club he had made 255 [[Football League|English League]] appearances and scored 82 league goals. He also played a further 16 games and scored a further 8 goals in the [[FA Cup]]. He made his final league appearance for Everton on May 7 1949.

==Irish international==
When Stevenson began his international career in 1932 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the [[Northern Ireland]] - based [[Irish Football Association|IFA]] and the [[Irish Free State]] - based [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] claimed jurisdiction over the whole of [[Ireland]] and selected players from the whole island. As a result several notable Irish players from this era, including Stevenson played for both teams. 

===FAI XI===
Between 1932 and 1948 Stevenson made 7 appearances for the FAI XI, making his international debut on May 8 1932 in a 2-0 win against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. His team-mates that day also included fellow dual internationalists, [[Mick O'Brien (1893-1940)|Mick O'Brien]], [[Jimmy Kelly (Irish footballer)|Jimmy Kelly]] and [[Paddy Moore]]. In October 1931 Stevenson had also played for a junior FAI XI against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] at [[Falkirk]]. However, Stevenson had to wait for fourteen years, partly because of the [[Second World War]], before he made his second appearance for the [[Ireland national football team (FAI)|FAI XI]] on September 30 1946 in a 1-0 defeat to [[England national football team|England]]. 

Puzzled by the fourteen year gap between his first and second FAI cap, Stevenson apparently approached both the [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] secretary-manager, [[Theo Kelly]], and the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]] secretary [[Joe Wickham]] for an explanation but neither was prepared to offer one. Stevenson, who was a [[Protestant]], was accused in some quarters of refusing to play for the FAI XI on religious grounds, but he was adamant that religion had nothing to do with it on his part. <ref>{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Sean | title = The Boys in Green: the FAI international story | publisher = Mainstream Publishing | year = 1997 | location = [[Edinburgh]] | id = ISBN 1-85158-939-2|pages=pg25}}
</ref>. He subsequently played for the FAI XI a further five times, helping them to a notable victory against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on March 2 1947. He made his last appearance for the FAI XI on December 5 1948 in a 1-0 defeat against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]. However this was not his last involvement with the FAI. Between 1953 and 1955 Stevenson served as coach of the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].

===IFA XI=== 
Between [[1933 British Home Championship|1933]] and [[1948 British Home Championship|1947]] Stevenson also made 19 appearances and scored 5 goals for the [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|IFA XI]], making his debut on September 16 1933 in a 2-1 win against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. He subsequently formed a notable inside forward partnership with [[Peter Doherty (footballer)|Peter Doherty]].  He scored his first goal for the IFA XI on February 6 1935 in 2-1 defeat against [[England national football team|England]]. He also scored against England in a 5-1 defeat on October 23 1937. His remaining three goals were all scored against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] in 1936, 1937 and 1947.

On May 11 1935, at [[Goodison Park]], Stevenson also played for an [[Ireland national football team (IFA)|Ireland]]/[[Wales national football team|Wales XI]] in a 10-2 defeat against an [[English League XI]]. During the [[Second World War]], he also played in two wartime internationals for the IFA XI. On September 9 1944 at [[Windsor Park]], he played an 8-4 defeat against a ''Combined Services XI''. This team was basically a [[Great Britain XI]] and featured, among others, [[Matt Busby]], [[Stanley Matthews]], [[Tommy Lawton]] and [[Stan Mortensen]]. He also played in the Victory international against Scotland at [[Windsor Park]] on February 2 1946. 

On November 27 [[1947 British Home Championship|1946]] the IFA selected Stevenson against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], together with [[Johnny Carey]], [[Con Martin]], [[Bill Gorman]], [[Tommy Eglington]], [[Peter Farrell]] and [[Davy Walsh]], this group comprising seven players who had been born in what was by now the [[Irish Free State]]. That said, the IFA was the governing body for the whole of Ireland at the time Stevenson was born (as was also the case with Carey and Gorman). On April 16 1947, he scored his last goal for the IFA XI in a 2-1 win against [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. These two results helped the IFA XI finish as runners-up in the [[1947 British Home Championship]]. Later that year, Stevenson made his last appearance for the IFA XI on October 4 1947 in a 2-0 win against Scotland.
