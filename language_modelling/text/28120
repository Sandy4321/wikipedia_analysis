'''Monte Gordo''' is [[S<U+00E3>o Nicolau, Cape Verde|S<U+00E3>o Nicolau]]'s tallest [[mountain]] located in the westcentral part of the island in [[Cape Verde]]. Its height is 1,312 m, some calculates as high as 1,340 m. The mountain and its ranges is entirely of [[volcanic]] origin. Since [[2005]], the municipal boundary of [[Tarrafal de S<U+00E3>o Nicolau, Cape Verde (municipality)|Tarrafal de S<U+00E3>o Nicolau]] and [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde (municipality)|Ribeira Brava]] (then by its island name) bounds at the mountaintop. The mountain is almost partly deforested, vegetations are mainly in valley areas and slopes and it contains trees and also features some areas with colorful ledges and a crater area. A communications tower serving radio and television to the island is near the mountaintop with the only road linking Monte Gordo, colorful green [[pine]] trees are in the higher elevations. The mountain can be seen from almost the whole island and also to the other two islands. The panorama offers a view to most of the whole western part and much of the eastern half of the island. Several mountains to the north and the south blocks the view of some coastal parts of the island.
