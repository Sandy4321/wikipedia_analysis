'''Seiichi Ito''' (<U+4F0A><U+85E4> <U+6574><U+4E00> ''It<U+014D> Seiichi'', [[1890]]-[[April 7]], [[1945]]) was a [[Japan]]ese [[admiral]] and commander of the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]] during [[World War II]]. 

Born in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Ito graduated from the [[Japanese Naval Academy]] in [[1911]] as a midshipman, and later [[Naval Staff College]] in [[1923]] as a lieutenant commander, in various posts throughout the decade before eventually commanding several cruisers between [[1933]] and [[1936]], most prominently as [[Captain]] of the [[battleship]] ''[[IJN Haruna]]''. 

In [[1937]], Ito became a [[Rear Admiral]] and appointed [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] to the [[IJN 2nd Fleet]] and the following year, he was named chief of the Navy Ministry's Personnel Bureau. After serving for two years, Ito commanded [[Cruiser Division 8]] in November 1940 until his appointment as Chief of Staff of the [[Combined Fleet]] in April 1941. 

In September of that year, Ito became vice chief of the Navy General Staff and promoted [[Vice Admiral]] a month later. A post he would hold throughout the Second World War, Ito was placed in command of the IJN 2nd Fleet based on the [[Inland Sea]] in December 1944. In the last months of the war, Ito commanded the last major offensive by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ([[Operation Ten-Go|Operation TEN-GO]]) when, in April 1945, he led the superbattleship ''[[IJN Yamato]]'' included in a fleet consisting of one light cruiser and eight destroyers in an attempt to destroy US naval forces based near [[Okinawa]]. Ito would be killed in the resulting [[Battle of the East China Sea]] when the Yamato was sunk, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers, by US carrier aircraft on April 7, 1945.
