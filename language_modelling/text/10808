'''Gratin dauphinois''' is a traditional regional French dish based on potatoes and ''[[cr<U+00E8>me fra<U+00EE>che]]'', from the historic [[Dauphin<U+00E9>]] region in south-east France. There are many variants of the name of the dish, including '''pommes de terre dauphinoise''', '''potatoes <U+00E0> la dauphinoise''' and '''gratin de pommes <U+00E0> la dauphinoise'''.<ref name=larousse/>

==History==
The first mention of the dish is from 12 July 1788. It was served with [[ortolan Bunting|ortolans]] at a dinner given by Charles-Henri, duke of [[Clermont-Tonnerre]] and Lieutenant-general of the Dauphin<U+00E9>, for the municipal officials of the town of [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], now in the [[d<U+00E9>partement]] of [[Hautes-Alpes]].<ref name=muller/>

==Preparation==
The gratin dauphinois is made with uncooked potatoes, thinly sliced, and cream, cooked in a buttered dish rubbed with garlic; for 1 kg of potatoes, about 600 ml of cream, 25 g of butter and a clove of garlic are needed. The potatoes are peeled and sliced to the thickness of a coin, preferably with a [[mandoline]]; they are layered in a shallow earthenware dish and cooked in a slow oven, at about 150<U+00B0>C, for more than an hour; the heat is raised for the last 10 minutes of the cooking time.<ref name=liz/><ref name=luard/> 

Recipes given by many authorities including [[Auguste Escoffier]] and [[Austin de Croze]] call for the addition of cheese and eggs to the dish;<ref name=liz/> [[Robert Carrier (chef)|Robert Carrier]] and [[Constance Spry]] give recipes including these additions.<ref name=bob/><ref name=constance/>

The dish is distinguished from ''gratin savoyard'' by the use of cream, and from ordinary gratin potatoes by the use of raw rather than boiled potatoes.<ref name=boul/> It is a quite different dish from [[pommes dauphine]].<ref name=liz/>
