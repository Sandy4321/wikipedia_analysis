==Others==
At the 2000 MTV VMAs, bass player [[Tim Commerford]] climbed to the top of the stage set and nearly brought the left stage down, it was in protest of the fact that Limp Bizkit's [[Break Stuff]] won Best Rock Video instead of Rage Against the Machine's "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]". Commerford was later arrested and spent a night in jail with his bodyguard. <ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Zahlaway |title=Rage Bassist Pleads Guilty To Misdemeanor After Disrupting MTV Awards |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/1777.html |publisher=Live Daily |date=[[2000-09-08]] |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}</ref>
