The '''Oort cloud''' ({{pronEng|?rt}} ''ort,'' alternatively the '''<U+00D6>pik-Oort Cloud''' ({{IPA2|'<U+00F8>p?k}}) is a spherical cloud of [[comet]]s believed to lie roughly [[1 E+15 m|50,000]] [[astronomical unit|AU]], or nearly a [[light-year]], from the [[Sun]];<ref name="Morbidelli2006">{{cite web

The [[Kuiper belt]] and [[scattered disc]], the other two known reservoirs of [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, are less than one thousandth the Oort cloud's distance. The outer extent of the Oort cloud defines the boundary of our [[Solar System]].

The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two separate regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or '''Hills cloud'''. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely composed of [[Volatiles|ices]] such as [[water]], [[ammonia]] and [[methane]]. Astronomers believe that the matter comprising the Oort cloud formed closer to the Sun, and was scattered far out into space by the [[Gravitation|gravitational effects]] of the [[Gas giant|giant planets]] early in the Solar System's evolution.<ref name=Morbidelli2006/>

Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, astronomers believe that it is the source of all long-period and [[Halley's Comet|Halley-type]] [[comet]]s entering the [[inner Solar System]], and many of the [[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaurs]] and [[Jupiter]]-family comets as well.<ref name="emel2007">{{cite journal

There are two main classes of comet: short-period comets (also called [[ecliptic]] comets) and long-period comets (also called nearly [[isotropy|isotropic]] comets). Ecliptic comets have relatively short orbits, below 10&nbsp;AU, and follow the [[ecliptic plane]], the same plane in which the planets lie. Nearly isotropic comets have very long orbits, on the order of thousands of AU, and appear from every corner of the sky.<ref name=book /> Oort noted that there was a peak in numbers of nearly isotropic comets with [[apsis|aphelia]]&mdash;their farthest distance from the Sun&mdash;of roughly 20,000&nbsp;AU, which suggested a reservoir at that distance with a spherical, isotropic distribution.<ref name=book /> Those relatively rare comets with orbits of about 10,000&nbsp;AU have probably gone through one or more orbits through the Solar System and have had their orbits drawn inward by the [[gravity]] of the planets.<ref name=book />

==Origin==
The Oort cloud is thought to be a remnant of the original [[protoplanetary disc]] that [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formed around the Sun]] approximately 4.6&nbsp;billion years ago.<ref name=Morbidelli2006/> The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the Oort cloud's objects initially coalesced much closer to the [[Sun]] as part of the same process that formed the [[planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s, but that gravitational interaction with young gas giant planets such as Jupiter ejected the objects into extremely long [[Elliptic orbit|elliptic]] or [[parabolic orbit]]s.<ref name=Morbidelli2006/><ref>{{cite web
 |title=Oort Cloud & Sol b? |work=SolStation
 |url=http://www.solstation.com/stars/oort.htm
 |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Simulations of the evolution of the Oort cloud from the beginnings of the Solar System to the present suggest that the cloud's mass peaked around 800&nbsp;million years after formation, as the pace of accretion and collision slowed and depletion began to overtake supply.<ref name=Morbidelli2006/> 

Models by [[Julio <U+00C1>ngel Fern<U+00E1>ndez]] suggest that the [[scattered disc]], which is the main source for [[periodic comet]]s in the Solar System, might also be the primary source for the Oort cloud objects. According to the models, about half of the objects scattered travel outward towards the Oort cloud, while a quarter are shifted inward to Jupiter's orbit, and a quarter are ejected on [[hyperbolic]] orbits. The scattered disc might still be supplying the Oort cloud with material.<ref>{{cite journal

Computer models suggest that collisions of cometary debris during the formation period play a far greater role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history was so great that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected.<ref>{{cite journal

Gravitational interaction with nearby stars and [[galactic tide]]s modified cometary orbits to make them more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud.<ref name=Morbidelli2006/> On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has yet to acquire a spherical shape. Recent studies have shown that the formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the [[Solar System]] formed as part of an embedded [[star cluster|cluster]] of 200&ndash;400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.<ref>{{cite journal

==Comets==
[[Image:Comet Hale-Bopp.jpg|thumb|150 px|Comet Hale-Bopp, an archetypal Oort cloud comet]]
[[Comet]]s are believed to have two separate points of origin in the Solar System. Short-period comets (those with orbits of up to 200&nbsp;years) are generally accepted to have emerged from the [[Kuiper belt]] or scattered disc, two linked flat discs of icy debris beginning at Pluto's orbit at 38&nbsp;AU and jointly extending out beyond 100&nbsp;AU from the Sun. Long-period comets, such as [[comet Hale-Bopp]], whose orbits last for thousands of years, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. The orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and so very few comets are believed to originate there. The scattered disc, however, is dynamically active, and is far more likely to be the place of origin for comets.<ref name=book /> Comets pass from the scattered disc into the realm of the outer planets, becoming what are known as [[centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Comet Populations and Cometary dynamics|journal=Encyclopedia of the Solar System|year=2007|pages=575-588|author=Harold E. Levison and Luke Dones}}</ref> These centaurs are then sent farther inward to become the short-period comets.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Populations of Comet-like Bodies in the Solar System|author=J Horner, NW Evans, ME Bailey, DJ Asher|url=http://star.arm.ac.uk/preprints/396.pdf|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-29}}</ref> 

There are two main varieties of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with [[semi-major axes]] of less than 5&nbsp;AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, [[Halley's Comet]], are unusual in that while they are short-period comets, their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is believed they were long-period comets that were captured by the gravity of the giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System.<ref name=dave /> This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.<ref name="emel2007" />

Oort noted that the number of returning comets was far less than his model predicted, and this issue, known as "cometary fading", has yet to be resolved. No known dynamical process can explain this undercount of observed comets. Hypotheses for this discrepancy include the destruction of comets due to tidal stresses, impact or heating; the loss of all [[volatiles]], rendering some comets invisible, or the formation of a non-volatile crust on the surface.<ref>{{cite book

==Tidal effects==
{{main|Galactic tide}}

Most of the comets seen close to the Sun are believed to have reached their current positions through gravitational distortion of the Oort cloud by the [[tidal force]] exerted by the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. Just as the [[Moon]]'s tidal force bends and deforms the Earth's oceans, causing the tides to rise and fall, so the galactic tide also bends and distorts bodies in the [[outer Solar System]], pulling them towards the galactic centre. In the charted regions of the Solar System, these effects are negligible compared to the gravity of the Sun. At the outer reaches of the system, however, the Sun's gravity is weaker and the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field plays a far more noticeable role. Because of this gradient, galactic tides can deform an otherwise spherical Oort cloud, stretching the cloud in the direction of the galactic centre and compressing it along the other two axes. These small galactic perturbations may be enough to dislodge members of the Oort cloud from their orbits, sending them towards the Sun.<ref>{{cite journal

==Star perturbations and stellar companion hypotheses==
Besides the galactic tide, the main trigger for sending comets into the inner Solar System is believed to be interaction between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of near-by stars<ref name=Morbidelli2006/> or [[giant molecular cloud]]s.<ref name=julio /> The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, during the next 10&nbsp;million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is [[Gliese 710]].<ref name=algol /> This process also serves to scatter the objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining the cloud's spherical distribution.<ref>{{cite journal

[[physics|Physicist]] [[Richard A. Muller]] and others have also postulated that the [[Sun]] has a heretofore undetected companion, either a [[brown dwarf]] or gaseous giant planet, in an elliptical orbit within the Oort cloud. This object, known as [[Nemesis (star)|Nemesis]], is theorized to pass through a portion of the Oort cloud approximately every 26&nbsp;million years, bombarding the [[inner Solar System]] with comets. Although the theory has many proponents, no direct proof of the existence of Nemesis has yet been found.<ref> {{cite journal

|publisher=Nature Publishing Group}} </ref> Furthermore, many argue that a companion star at such a great distance could not have a stable orbit, as it would probably be ejected by perturbations from other stars.

A similar hypothesis has been advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|University of Louisiana]]. He contends that more comets are arriving in the inner Solar System from a particular region of the Oort cloud than can be explained by the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause is a bound [[Jupiter]]-mass object in a distant orbit.<ref>{{cite web

Alternatives to the Nemesis hypothesis speculate that the purported regularity in extinction events is due not to the regular passage of a distant star but to the Sun's passage through the Milky Way. One hypothesis supposes that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the [[galactic centre]] cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker; as it re-enters the galactic disc, as it does every 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;million years, it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the Solar System by a factor of 4.<ref>{{cite web

However, others argue that the Sun is currently close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's [[spiral arms]]. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright [[blue giant]] stars, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as [[supernovae]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mass Extinctions and The Sun's Encounters with Spiral Arms|author=Erik M.

==Oort cloud objects (OCOs)==
[[Image:Sedna-NASA.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Sedna, a possible inner Oort cloud object discovered in 2004]]
Only two known objects have orbits which suggest that they may belong to the Oort Cloud: [[90377 Sedna]] and [[(148209) 2000 CR105|2000 CR<sub>105</sub>]]. Unlike scattered disc objects, their perihelia are not within gravitational reach of Neptune, and thus their orbits cannot be explained by [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] by the [[gas giant]] planets.<ref>{{cite journal|title=DISCOVERY OF A CANDIDATE INNER OORT CLOUD PLANETOID|author=Michael E.
