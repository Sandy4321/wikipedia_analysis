'''South Creek''' or '''''Wianamatta''''',<ref name=gnbw/> a [[perennial stream|creek]] that is part of the [[Hawkesbury River|Hawkesbury]]-[[Nepean River|Nepean]] catchment, is located in [[Greater Western Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

==Course and features==

The creek rises in [[Sydney]]'s south western suburbs below the former [[Oran Park Raceway]] about {{convert|4|km}} north-east of [[Narellan, New South Wales|Narellan]] and {{convert|7|km}} west of [[Minto, New South Wales|Minto]]. In its upper catchment, the creek forms the boundary between the suburbs of [[Oran Park, New South Wales|Oran Park]] and [[Catherine Field, New South Wales|Catherine Field]]. The creek flows generally north, joined by seventeen [[tributary|tributaries]] including [[Badgerys Creek]], [[Kemps Creek]], [[Ropes Creek (New South Wales)|Ropes Creek]] and [[Eastern Creek]], until reaching its [[confluence]] with the Hawkesbury River, near [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]]. The creek descends {{convert|94|m}} over its {{convert|70|km}} [[Course (navigation)#Determining the track|course]].<ref name=bonzle/>

From source to [[mouth (river)|mouth]], the creek flows through or forms the boundary of the suburbs of [[Bringelly, New South Wales|Bringelly]],  [[Rossmore, New South Wales|Rossmore]], [[Badgerys Creek, New South Wales|Badgerys Creek]], [[Kemps Creek, New South Wales|Kemps Creek]], [[Claremont Meadows, New South Wales|Claremont Meadows]], [[Orchard Hills, New South Wales|Orchard Hills]], [[Werrington, New South Wales|Werrington]], [[St Marys, New South Wales|St Marys]], [[Werrington County, New South Wales|Werrington County]], [[Dunheved, New South Wales|Dunheved]], [[Llandilo, New South Wales|Llandilo]], [[Shanes Park, New South Wales|Shanes Park]], [[Berkshire Park, New South Wales|Berkshire Park]], [[Windsor Downs, New South Wales|Windsor Downs]], [[Riverstone, New South Wales|Riverstone]], [[Vineyard, New South Wales|Vineyard]], [[Mulgrave, New South Wales|Mulgrave]], [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]], [[McGraths Hill, New South Wales|McGraths Hill]] and [[Pitt Town Bottoms, New South Wales|Pitt Town Bottoms]].<ref name=bonzle/>

=== Tributaries ===
The South Creek or ''Wianamatta'' is joined by Lowes Creek and Rileys Creek at Bringelly; by Thompsons Creek at Rossmore; by Badgerys Creek and by Kemps Creek at the suburb of Badgerys Creek; by Cosgrove Creek at Luddenham; by Blaxland Creek at Orchard Hills; by Byrnes Creek at St Marys; by Claremont Creek at Werrington; by Werrington Creek at Werrington County; by three unnamed creeks at Llandilo, Marsden Park, and Riverstone; by Ropes Creek at Shanes Park; by Eastern Creek at Vineyard; by McGraths Hill Wetlands and by McKenzies Creek at McGraths Hill.

== Etymology ==
''Wianamatta'' is an [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal]] word of the [[Dharug language]], meaning 'mother place'.<ref name=gnbw/>

South Creek was dual-named as ''Wianamatta'' on 28 March 2003 by the [[Geographical Names Board of New South Wales]] (GNB).<ref name=gnbw/><ref name=gnbsc/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camden.nsw.gov.au/files/2003_minutes/development_committee_28_april_2003.pdf|format=PDF|date=28 April 2003|title=Minutes of the Development Committee Meeting|publisher=[[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]]|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>

It was dual-named after a submission that the name be changed. However, a lengthy investigation followed, and after consultation with local [[Aboriginal Land Council]]s it was decided after extensive workshops carried by the GNB, that instead, a dual-naming proposal should be pursued instead. Following that decision, the GNB carried out an extensive consultation throughout the entire state of NSW, contacting all Aboriginal land councils on record as well as placing entries in every prominent and regional newspaper explaining the proposal and inviting comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/67344/GNB_report_-_pp71-76_PDF_399_kb.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|work=NSW Department of Lands|year=2007|accessdate=20 June 2013|title=Geographical Names Board Report}}</ref>

==Township==
A township of South Creek used to exist{{citation needed|datee=January 2011|date=January 2011}} where the creek joins the Hawkesbury River. The name only existed for a few years in the early settlement of New South Wales and now it is part of Windsor. One of its pioneer settlers was [[Thomas Jamison]] (1753<U+2013>1811) who arrived with the First Fleet and became Surgeon-General of New South Wales in 1801.
