==School Song==

'''''First Verse'''''<br />
In the valley where skies are so blue,<br />
,< />
Where our hearts are all loyal and true,<br />
Where there's joy in the air and goodwill everywhere,<br />
Stands the school that we all adore.<br /><br />

We will love you our old Morgan High,<br />
Til the stars cease to shine in the sky,<br />
Live or die we stand together, sun or rain our school forever,<br />
For we love you our Morgan High.<br /><br />

'''''Second Verse'''''<br />
There's a place in our hearts all your own,<br />
Tis the sweet tender longing for home.<br />
May the deeds that we do reflect honor to you,<br />
When far from your portals we roam.<br /><br />

Give three cheers for our old Morgan High,<br />
Where we never say can't but I'll try, <br />
Heart and hand to thee we render, brain and brawn be thy defender,<br />
For we love you our Morgan High.<br /><br />

'''''Third Verse''''' <br />
You're the best little school in the land,<br />
From the freshies to seniors so grand,<br />
From the shop with its' noise to our basketball boys,<br />
For victory and honor we stand.<br /><br />

We are proud of our boys in the game,<br />
They bring honor to Morgan's proud name.<br />
They are never spoiled by winning, they can lose and keep on grinning,<br />
They're the product of Morgan High.<br /><br />

'''''Fourth Verse''''' ''(Sung by Seniors at Graduation only)''<br />
Still you bring us an hour of regret,<br />
When we smile while our eyelids are wet,<br />
In our hearts there's a sigh, as we bid you goodbye,<br />
Tis the hour that we won't forget.<br /><br />

Now we'll miss you our old Morgan High<br />
From the hour we bid you goodbye,<br />
But you've gilded all our sorrow with a bright hope for tomorrow,<br />
And we love you our old Morgan High.<br />
