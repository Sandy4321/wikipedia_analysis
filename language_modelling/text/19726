==Biography==
===Early years===

George Ross Kirkpatrick was born February 24, 1867 in [[West Lafayette, Ohio]], the son of a farmer.<ref name="ALWW">Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), ''The American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 126.</ref> He attended Allegheny College Preparatory School before enrolling in [[Ohio Wesleyan University]]. He received his [[Bachelor's degree]] from [[Albion College]] and did graduate coursework at [[Vanderbilt University]] and the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="ALWW" />

Upon graduation, Kirkpatrick worked as a teacher at [[Ripon College]] for 4 years before moving to the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party-]]affiliated [[Rand School of Social Science]] in [[New York City]].<ref name="ALWW" />

===Political career===

Kirkpatrick joined the Socialist Party in 1903. For nearly 20 years thereafter, Kirkpatrick traveled across America as a lecturer for the party, speaking to general audiences on the topic of militarism and other political and economic questions.<ref name="ALWW" />

In 1910 he self-published his first full-length book, a blistering attack on [[militarism]] called ''War <U+2014> What For?'' The first printing of 2500 copies sold out almost immediately and the book was subsequently reprinted many times over the course of the decade.<ref>Kirkpatrick clearly tried to get his readers to assist in the distribution of the work <U+2014> the dust jacket of the 2nd edition listed wholesale rates of as little as 55 cents per copy on 100 pieces for a cover price of $1.20.</ref>

[[File:Kirkpatrick-warwhatfor-dj-1910.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The widespread popularity among the party rank-and-file of Kirkpatrick's 1910 book, ''War <U+2014> What For?'' was key to his being chosen as the Socialist Party's VP nominee in 1916.]]
In 1916, a mail referendum of the membership of the Socialist Party of America named Kirkpatrick as the party's Vice Presidential nominee, topping [[St. Louis]] feminist [[Kate Richards O'Hare]] in the contest.<ref>David A. Shannon, ''The Socialist Party: A History.'' New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 91.</ref> Kirkpatrick appeared on the ballot along with with Presidential hopeful [[Allan L. Benson]] and he toured extensively in support of the ticket.

In 1924, Kirkpatrick was in Chicago on the payroll of the Socialist Party as the manager of its "Department of Literature."<ref>George R. Kirkpatrick, "Select Your Weapons," ''The Socialist World,'' vol. 5, no. 5 (May 1924), pg. 11.</ref> In that capacity he prepared several propaganda leaflets which were distributed in quantity by the party during the 1924 campaign season: a first on the growing wealth of the capitalist class (a four page leaflet entitled ''Silence!),'' another detailing the party's opposition to the then-booming [[Ku Klux Klan]], and a third on unemployment. He also edited the party's monthly magazine, ''The Socialist World,'' with Executive Secretary [[Bertha Hale White|Bertha Hale White's]] name appearing on the masthead of the publication as "Business Manager."

From November 15, 1925, Kirkpatrick served a brief stint as acting Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party, following the resignation of Bertha Hale White, herself a former teacher and journalist.<ref>Shannon, ''The Socialist Party: A History,'' pg. 184.</ref> Kirkpatrick, who had been serving as Organization Director, was elected Assistant Executive Secretary by the National Executive Committee at its meeting of October 10, on the heels of White tendering of her resignation effective in a month.<ref>"Minutes of National Executive Committee Meeting, Breslin Hotel, New York City, October 9-10, 1925," ''The Socialist World,'' vol. 6, no. 8 (October 1925), pg. 8.</ref> Kirkpatrick's time at the helm of the declining organization would be a short one, however, and he soon departed to be replaced by [[William H. Henry]] of [[Indiana]].

Kirkpatrick later ran for [[U.S. Senate]] from [[Illinios]] on the Socialist Party ticket in 1928, and for the U.S. Senate from [[California]] in 1932 and 1934.<ref>Larry Kestenbaum (ed.), [http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/kirkpatrick.html "Kirkpatrick, George R.,"] political graveyard.com  Retrieved March 6, 2010.</ref>
