Mara and Clara were switched at birth in the nursery when they were born, and the details of this event were recorded by Karlo, a hospital staff, in his diary. Mara lived as the poor daughter of the couple Susan and Gary David and Clara, their real daughter, was brought up by the rich Amante and Alvira del Valle. 

The good-natured del Valle couple takes in Mara as a servant and decides to spend for her education not knowing that she is their real daughter. Gary, who is actually a gang/syndicate leader, approves of the idea that Mara lives with the del Valles to extort money. Clara makes life for Mara difficult.
