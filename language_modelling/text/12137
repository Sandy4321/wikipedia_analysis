'''Jule Styne''' (December 31, 1905 &ndash; September 20, 1994) was a [[United Kingdom|British]]-born [[United States|American]] [[songwriter]] especially famous for a series of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musicals]], which included several very well known and frequently revived shows.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Styne was born in [[London]], [[England]] as '''Julius Kerwin Stein''' of [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/570351/Jule-Styne|title=Jule Styne|work=Britannica Online|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> At the age of eight he moved with his family to [[Chicago]], where at an early age he began taking [[piano]] lessons. He proved to be a [[Child prodigy|prodigy]] and performed with the Chicago, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] Symphonies before he was ten years old.

===Career===
Styne attended Chicago Musical College, but before then he had already attracted attention of another teenager, [[Mike Todd]], later a successful film producer, who commissioned him to write a song for a musical act that he was creating. It would be the first of over 1,500 published songs Styne would compose in his career. 

Styne established his own dance band, which brought him to the notice of Hollywood, where he was championed by [[Frank Sinatra]] and where he began a collaboration with lyricist [[Sammy Cahn]], with whom he wrote many songs for the movies, including "It's Been a Long, Long Time," "Five Minutes More," and the [[Academy award|Oscar]]-winning "[[Three Coins in the Fountain (song)|Three Coins in the Fountain]]." He collaborated on the score for the 1955 musical film ''[[My Sister Eileen]]'' with [[Leo Robin]]. Ten of his songs were nominated for the Oscar, many written with Cahn, including "It Seems I Heard That Song Before",  "[[I'll Walk Alone]]", "[[It's Magic]]", and  "[[I_Fall_In_Love_Too_Easily|I Fall in Love Too Easily]]."

In 1947 Styne wrote his first score for a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, ''[[High Button Shoes]]'' with Cahn, and over the next several decades wrote the scores for many Broadway shows, most notably ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'' (additional music), ''[[Bells Are Ringing]]'', ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'', ''[[Do Re Mi (musical)|Do Re Mi]]'', ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', ''[[Sugar (musical)|Sugar]]'' (with a story based on the movie [[Some Like It Hot]], but all new music), and the Tony-winning ''[[Hallelujah, Baby!]]''. 

His collaborators included, among others, [[Sammy Cahn]], [[Leo Robin]], [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], [[Stephen Sondheim]], and [[Bob Merrill]].

Styne wrote original music for the short-lived, themed [[amusement park]] [[Freedomland U.S.A.]] which opened on June 19, 1960.

Styne was elected to the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1972 and the Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981, and he was a recipient of a [[Drama Desk Special Award]] and the [[Kennedy Center]] Honors in 1990.
