'''SMS ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] built by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the early 20th century. She was launched on 11 September 1901 as second of three {{sclass|Habsburg|battleship|0}} battleships.<ref name="Conways330">Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 330</ref> Along with her sisterships, she participated at the bombardment of [[Ancona]] during [[World War I]]. After the ar, all of the Habsurg-class battleships were ceded to Great Britain as war prizes. She was scrapped in [[Italy]] in 1921.

==Construction and layout==

[[File:Habsburg class linedrawing2.jpg|thumb|left|Line-drawing of the ''Habsburg''-class ships; shaded areas show the extent of the armor layout]]
''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' was the second of three battleships of her class. Her hull was laid down on 10 June 1899 at the [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] shipyard in [[Trieste]]. Following more than two years of construction, she was launched on 11 September 1901. After final fitting-out work was finished, ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' was fully ready for service and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian navy on 15 June 1903.<ref name=Conways333>Gardiner & Gray, p. 333</ref>

Like all ships of her class, the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' was 113.11&nbsp;m (371&nbsp;ft) [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and was 114.55&nbsp;m (375&nbsp;ft 10&nbsp;in) in [[length overall|overall length]].<ref name=Conways1860>Gardiner, Chesneau, & Kolesnik, p. 272</ref> She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of 19.8&nbsp;m (65&nbsp;ft) and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of 7.5&nbsp;m (24&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in).<ref name=Hore/> [[Freeboard]] was approximately {{convert|5.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} forward and about {{convert|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} aft.  She also displaced 8,364&nbsp;[[metric ton]]s (8,232&nbsp;[[long ton]]s). Once construction on her had finished and she was commissioned into the Navy, ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' had a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=Hore>Hore, p. 91</ref> 

The ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' was powered by 2-shaft, 4-cylinder vertical [[triple expansion engine]]s, which were supplied with steam by 16 Belleville [[boiler]]s. ''Habsburg''{{'}}s power output was rated at 14,307&nbsp;[[indicated horsepower]] (ihp), which produced a top speed of {{convert|19.65|kn}}.<ref name=Conways1860/> 

The hull for the ship was constructed from longitudinal and transverse steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were [[rivet]]ed into place. The hull incorporated a [[double bottom]] that ran for 63% of the ship's length. A series of watertight bulkheads also extended from the [[keel]] to the gun deck. All in all, there was a total of 174 [[watertight compartment]]s in  the ship.<ref>US Office of Naval Intelligence, LArry Phelps p. 25</ref> ''Habsburg'' had a [[metacentric height]] of between {{convert|.82|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.02|m|ft|abbr=on}}. [[Bilge keel]]s were mounted on either side of the hull to reduce rolling and prevent her from capsizing.<ref>US Office of Naval Intelligence, Larry Phelps p. 26</ref> ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' had a flush main deck that was planked with wood, while the upper decks were covered with [[linoleum]] or [[corticine]]. 

The ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' had three 24&nbsp;cm (9.4&nbsp;in) L/40 guns, two mounted in a twin [[Gun turret|turret]] forward and one mounted in a single turret aft of the main superstructure. The C&nbsp;97-type guns were manufactured by [[Krupp]] in Germany.<ref name=Conways1860/> The main guns fired at a [[rate of fire|rate]] of between three to four 215&nbsp;kg (474&nbsp;lb) [[armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] (AP) shells per minute. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;inch) SK L/40 guns in [[casemate]]s.<ref name=Conways1860/> These guns could fire at 4&ndash;5 shells per minute. She was built with [[Case hardening|face-hardened]] chrome-nickel steel. The main [[belt armor|armored belt]] was {{convert|220|mm|in|abbr=on}} in the central portion of the ship, where the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other critical areas were located. The belt tapered slightly to {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} on either end of the central section.<ref name=Conways1860/>

==Service history==
===Peacetime===
''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' took part in her first fleet maneuvers in mid 1903 with her sistership ''Habsburg''. By the summer of 1904, ''Babenberg'' was commissioned and participated in succeeding fleet drills. Following a series of simulated wargames between the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' and her sister ships against the three {{sclass|Monarch|battleship|3}}s,<ref name=Sondhaus/> the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' and the other two ''Habsburg''-class ships became the I Battleship Division.<ref>United Service Magazine, p. 437</ref> This new division was active in the Mediterranean region. When the ''Habsburg'' underwent a training cruise of the area with the three ''Monarch''-class battleships in January 1903, ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' joined her the next year in a voyage around the Mediterranean Sea.<ref name=Sondhaus>Sondhaus, p. 158</ref> With the commissioning of the {{sclass|Erzherzog Karl|battleship|3}}s in 1906 and 1907, the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' and her sisterships were transferred from the I to the II Battleship Division, and the three ''Monarch''-class battleships were moved from the II to the III Battleship Division.<refname=Sondhaus/> In 1910&ndash;1911, the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' had one of her superstructure decks removed to reduce weight.<ref name="Conways330" />

===World War I===
During the early period of [[World War I]], ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' was transferred to the IV Division after the first new {{sclass|Tegetthoff|battleship|3}}s came into service. At around the same time, she was mobilized along with her sisterships {{SMS|Habsburg||2}} and {{SMS|Babenberg||2}} and the remainder of the Austro-Hungarian Navy to support the flight of {{SMS|Goeben}} and {{SMS|Breslau||2}}. The two German were ships stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of [[Messina]], which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey. After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina, the Navy was recalled. The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as [[Brindisi]] in southeastern Italy.<ref>Halpern, p. 54</ref>. After [[Italy]] entered the war on the side of [[France]] and [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], the Austro-Hungarian Navy bombarded several Italian port cities along the Adriatic coast. ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'' took part in the [[Adriatic_Campaign_of_World_War_I#Bombardment_of_Ancona|bombardment of Ancona]].<ref name=Hore/> She was later decommissioned and served as a harbor defense ship for the latter half of the war.<ref name=Conways330/> ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d''{{'}}s crew was then transferred to man new [[U-boat]]s and aircraft.<ref name=Hore/> Following the end of the war, the ''<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d'', along with her sisterships, were awarded to Great Britain as [[war prize]]s. They were sold to Italy and broken up for scrap in 1921.<ref name=Conways330>Gardiner and Gray (1984), p. 330</ref>
