The municipality borders those of  [[<U+017D>abljak]], [[Bijelo Polje]] and [[Mojkovac]] in Montenegro, as well as the republics of [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. With a total area of 1,346 km<U+00B2>, it is the third largest [[municipality]] in [[Montenegro]]. The city lies at an altitude of 770 m. The highest point of the [[municipality]] is on the [[Ljubi<U+0161>nja]] mountain at an altitude of 2,238 m, while the lowest point is in the canyon of Tara river with an altitude of 520 m above sea level. In 2003, the [[municipality]] of Pljevlja had a population of 36,918, while the city  itself had a population of about 21,000.

==History==

The first [[human]] settlements in Pljevlja<U+2019>s region were in the last [[Ice Age]]. The evidence, which is considered to be the earliest in this part of [[Europe]], can be found in [[Mali<U+0161>ina]] cave close to the modern city of Pljevlja. However, far richer are the settlements from the [[Stone Age]] found in Medena Stijena.
The first cultural people in this region are considered the Illyric tribes, Pirust, which lived there until the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of the first century AD. The Romans built their own city on the ruins of the [[Illyrian]] city and named it '''Municipium S''' (S is the first letter of the name of the city that was founded on the ruins near Pljevlja's Komini suburb). The city was the second largest Roman city in modern [[Montenegro]] after [[Doclea]]. Municipium S was the large trade and religious center of the upper Roman province of [[Dalmatia]]. A large number of valuable objects including jewellery pieces, glass vases and pottery have been found in the ruins of the old city. The most valuable object is the Diatreta or [[cage cup]], a glass vase trimmed with blue glass threads which is considered to be priceless and the only one of its kind in the world.

The [[Slavs]] eventually entered this region in the 6th century and built a city called '''Breznik''' (Breznica), first mentioned in 822, named after the river which runs through the city. The city blossomed over the centuries and became one of the main cities in the early [[Serbia]]n state of [[Ra<U+0161>ka]]. Breznik was on the main routes from [[Dubrovnik]], Trieste and [[Kotor]] to [[Constantinople]], [[Sarajevo]] and [[Belgrade]] and because of that, the first customs was opened in 1338. From 14th century city had the double name '''Breznik''' and '''Pljevlja'''. After the breakdown of Du<U+0161>an<U+2019>s empire, Breznik (Pljevlja) was ruled by many rulers: from 1368 to 1373 by [[Nikola Altomanovi<U+0107>]], 1373 to 1435 by Bosnian King [[Tvrtko]] and from 1435 till [[September 1]] 1462 by Herzog [[Stefan Vuk<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] when he lost the city to the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The new name, Pljevlja, was not in use for a long time because after the Ottoman invasion the city was renamed '''Taslid<U+017E>a''' (rocky terms). Turks upgraded the city to 'kasaba', a larger Ottoman city without a fortress. The 15th and 16th centuries were a period of much construction in the city: in 1465 a [[monastery]] was founded dedicated to the Holy Trinity; in 1569 Husein-pa<U+0161>a<U+2019>s [[mosque]] was built and during the 16th century the city got a sewage system. When the center of  [[Herzegovina|Hercegova<U+010D>ki]] [[Sanjak]] (''Sanjak of Herzegovina'') was moved to Pljevlja from Fo<U+010D>a in 1572, the city started to change rapidly: urban housing increased&mdash; 72 houses in 1468, 150 in 1516, 300 in 1570; in the 17th century Pljevlja had around 650 houses in the city center and over 400 in the surrounding area. The first muslim religious school, Medresa, was built in the 17th century; water-works were constructed in the 18th century. The Russian consul visited Pljevlja in the 19th century and wrote that Pljevlja was a very beautiful oriental city with gardens and fountains, mosques and churches and over 800 houses in the city center (7,000 citizens) which made Pljevlja the second largest city in Hercegova<U+010D>ki Sanjak beside [[Mostar]]. After two big fires that burned the city center to the ground, the city's economy was ruined. That was the reason for displacing the center of Hercegova<U+010D>ki Sanjak to [[Mostar]] in 1833. After 1833 the city stagnated in both an economic and cultural sense.

In 1878, Pljevlja was occupied by [[Austria-Hungary]] like [[Novi Pazar|Yenipazar]] sanjak. 5,000 army soldiers with their wives and children came to Pljevlja. That was a beginning of a new era for the city because Austrians transformed Pljevlja into a modern western city with hotels, bookstores, theater and cultural events. The first modern drug store was opened in 1879, a photo store in 1892, hospital in 1880 and beer factory in 1889 (<U+0160>e<U+0107>erovi<U+0107> beer factory). Austrians withdrew from the town in 1908 and the Ottoman army returned to it. In 1880 Pljevlja became the center of Pljevaljski Sanjak (''Sanjak of Ta<U+015F>l<U+0131>ca'') which existed till 1912 when Pljevlja was captured from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Serbian and Montenegrin armies captured Pljevlja on the same day. In 1913 Pljevlja became a part of [[Kingdom of Montenegro]], and after [[World War I]] a part of Zetska Banovina in the Kingdom of [[Yugoslavia]]. Finally, in 1945, after [[World War II]], Pljevlja become a part of [[Montenegro]].
