The '''Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building''', commonly known as '''Tech Tower''', is a historic building located on Cherry Street in [[Midtown Atlanta]] and a focal point of the central campus of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (Georgia Tech). Erected in 1888 and named the '''Academic Building''', Tech Tower was one of the first two buildings to be completed on the Georgia Tech campus. Tech Tower was built as a venue for classroom instruction to complement the hands-on training taking place in the shop building beside it. Since the shop's razing in 1892 following a disastrous fire,<ref name="towerweb">{{cite web|first=John|last=Holcombe|url=http://www.space.gatech.edu/danshiki/Tower/TowerWeb.html|title=TowerWeb: Historic Images and Information about the Georgia Tech Tower''s''|publisher=Georgia Tech Capital Planning and Space Management|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref name="moniker">{{cite news|first=Karl|last=Guertin|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-02-13/opinions/2|title=Tech<U+2019>s moniker reveals its true history|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[2004-02-13]]|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Tech Tower enjoys the distinction of being the oldest structure on the Georgia Tech campus.<ref name="vtour">{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/vtour/quick-tour/quicktour.swf|title=Tech Virtual Tour|publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref>

Tech Tower derives its nickname from a prominent seven-story central tower dominating the building's [[facade]] and visible from many parts of the Georgia Tech campus and surrounding area. Lighted signs in the shape of the word ''TECH'' hang atop each of the tower's four sides. A number of times, Georgia Tech students have accomplished the arduous task of [[Tech Tower#Stealing the 'T'|stealing the letter 'T']] from one of these signs, a prank now strictly forbidden by Institute officials despite prior attitudes to the contrary.<ref name="PresidentialOpinions">{{cite news|title=Presidential opinions change over time|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2001-08-24/news/12|date=[[2001-08-24]]|accessdate = 2007-02-01|last=Shaw|first=Jody|work=[[The Technique]]}}</ref>

Tech Tower has achieved local cultural and historical significance in the century since its construction. Monuments and plaques commemorating philanthropy towards Georgia Tech adorn Tech Tower and the surrounding landscape. The red brick, [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] building serves as the architectural anchor of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District]],<ref name="Historic District">{{cite web

{{seealso|History of Georgia Tech}}
[[Image:Tech Tower and Shop 1899.jpg|An early photograph of the new Shop Building (left) and Tech Tower (right), circa 1899.|right|thumb]]

In 1887, the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] acquired nine [[acre]]s of land from Atlanta pioneer [[Richard Peters (Atlanta)|Richard Peters]] that would form the original campus of what was then called the Georgia School of Technology, as well as the site of its first two structures. The state hired the well-known architectural firm Bruce &amp; Morgan to design an Academic Building, containing "ample accommodations in halls, offices, apparatus rooms, recitation and lecture rooms, [[drawing|free hand]] and [[technical drawing|mechanical drawing]] rooms, library and chapel," as well as a Shop Building, in which "[[boiler room|boiler]] and engine rooms, [[carpentry|wood shop]], [[machining|machine shop]], [[forge|forge room]] and [[foundry]]" were located.<ref name="AnnualCatalogue">{{ cite book | title = Annual Catalogue | year = 1888 | publisher = Georgia School of Technology }}</ref> 

Both buildings boasted towers and edifices of similar design. The complementary names and purposes of these buildings reflected the School's founding principles of valuing both [[theory]] and [[practice]], while their similar appearance emphasized the equal standing of these principles. Construction work, contracted by Angus McGilvray with his low bid of [[United States dollar|US$]]43,250, began with the Academic Building in June 1887; the building was completed in September 1888. The Shop Building, completed shortly afterward, was destroyed by fire in 1892 and rebuilt more modestly without a tower.<ref name="towerweb" /> Following this, the Academic Building, later known as Tech Tower,<ref name="NamingEvans">{{cite web

Georgia Tech's Class of 1922 installed the famous ''TECH'' signs on all four sides of Tech Tower, giving rise to the building's present nickname. The signs were originally made of wood and painted white and gold &mdash; the Institute colors. In the 1930s, lightbulbs were affixed to the signs to illuminate them more effectively than the earlier ground-based spotlights. In 1949, the ''TECH'' signs were supplemented by [[neon sign|neon lighting]] in metal frames.<ref name="TechHistory">{{cite web

In 1978, Tech Tower and the surrounding nine acres of the original campus were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the [[Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/GA/Fulton/state2.html|title=Georgia (GA), Fulton County: Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|work=National Register of Historical Places|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/atlanta/git.htm|title=Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District|publisher=National Park Service Atlanta|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Near the entrance to Tech Tower, a [[historical marker]] maintained by the [[Georgia Historical Society]] commemorates this listing as well as the early history of Georgia Tech|history of the Georgia Tech campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=035-8|title=Historic Marker: Plaque|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref>

A restoration project called the "Tech Tower Renovation" began in 1987, spearheaded by alumnus Eugene M. Clary's gift of new copper shingles with which to replace Tech Tower's aging roof tiles.<ref name="TechHistory"/> One of these shingles and a small marker inside the Tech Tower entrance lobby commemorate Clary and his donation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=035-17|title=Tech Tower Renovation: Plaque|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref>

On [[May 22]], [[1998]], Tech Tower was officially renamed the Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building in a ceremony presided over by Tech president [[G. Wayne Clough]].<ref name="NamingEvans"/> Although neither she nor her husbands attended Georgia Tech as a student, [[Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans]] was a longtime benefactor of the Institute, contributing over $340 million through her [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] organization, the Lettie Pate Evans Foundation.<ref name="FiftyYears">{{cite news|url=http://www.gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/fall02/article1.html|title=Fifty Years, Fifty Women|work=Georgia Tech Alumni Magazine Online|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Fall 2002|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> As of 2006, Evans is the only woman to be recognized by Georgia Tech with a building named in her honor.<ref name="FiftyYears"/>

==Structure and appearance==
[[Image:GeorgiaTechSteamWhistle.jpg|right|thumb|The "steam engine," a steam-driven [[air compressor]] on Cherry Street, with Tech Tower in the background]]
Tech Tower is built in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] influences. The building's original specifications, according to Georgia Tech's first ''Annual Catalogue'' published in 1888, are listed as 130&nbsp;feet wide and 120&nbsp;feet deep.<ref name="AnnualCatalogue" /> It is constructed primarily of red brick and trimmed with [[granite]]. The [[gable]]d roof, originally [[terra cotta]], was later replaced by copper shingles.<ref name="TechHistory"/> The main complex of the building stands four stories high plus a basement. The tower portion stands seven stories high and is topped with four lighted ''TECH'' signs (one on each side) and a high pitched roof. The main entrance to the building is accessed by ascending a small staircase and entering a small porch which forms the base of Tech Tower. Most of the building's windows are simple rectangular frames, with the exception of those on the third floor, which are arched. The entire complex sits on the crest of a tree-dotted hill, giving it the appearance of being larger than it actually is.<ref name="MSAA" />

===Surroundings===
As the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, Tech Tower has accumulated a number of peripheral [[monument]]s and sites of interest over the years. Two walkways encircle the building, including the Tower Walk, donated by the Class of 1950 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=035-6|title=Class Of 1950 Tower Walk: Plaque|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=031-1|title=Class Of 1975 Reunion Walk: Plaque|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://gtalumni.org/news/ttopics/win00/black.html#article2|title=Lasting Generosity|work=Tech Topics|publisher=Georgia Tech Alumni Association|date=Winter 2000|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Georgia Tech's first class memorial, a marble drinking fountain, was donated in 1911 by the Class of 1903 and is situated east of Tech Tower's main entrance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=035-4|title=Class Of 1903: Fountain|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Also near the main entrance to Tech Tower is a [[marble]]d pair of benches donated by the Class of 1925 in memory of those who died in [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irp.gatech.edu/space/mon.cfm?ffn=035-15|title=Class Of 1925 Ww I Memorial: Bench|work=Monument List|publisher=Georgia Tech Institutional Research and Planning|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> A few feet away stands a marbled bench memorial to Paul Howes Norcross, a 1902 Georgia Tech alumnus and former [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] president who perished in the [[M.E.

Tech Tower is considered an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and of higher education in [[Atlanta]]. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]]. [[Kessler Campanile]], a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide [[brand|branding]] campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Georgia Tech Kessler Campanile | publisher = Architectural Support Services, Inc. | url = http://assi-cad.com/gatech.html | accessdate = 2007-02-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Multimedia.jsp?id=m-3802|title=Kessler Campanile|work=New Georgia Encyclopedia|accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.<ref name="UseTheTower" />

==Stealing the 'T'==
{{seealso|Georgia Tech traditions}}
Students have stolen the huge, symbolic letter 'T' on the Tech Tower's ''TECH'' signs a number of times.<ref name="ujc">{{ cite news | date = [[2001-09-07]] | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | work = [[The Technique]] | title = UJC recommends suspension for 'T' thieves | last = Barday | first = Nasir | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2001-09-07/news/2 }}</ref> The 'T' is then returned at the halftime of the [[homecoming]] [[college football|football]] game, and the students' achievement celebrated.

===Notable thefts===
[[Image:TechTowerSign.jpg|A closeup of Tech Tower's iconic ''TECH'' signage|thumb|right]]
The 'T' was first stolen in April 1969 by a secret group of Georgia Tech fraternity brothers calling themselves the "Magnificent Seven."<ref name="Dismantling">{{ cite news | title = Dismantling a tradition | work = Tech Topics | publisher = Georgia Tech Alumni Association | date = Winter 1999 | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | url = http://gtalumni.org/StayInformed/techtopics/win99/hill.html#stealing | last = Coffee | first = Hoyt }}</ref> The students, who were inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in 1968 at [[Harvard University]], planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President [[Edwin D. Harrison]]'s retirement. The 'T' was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.|Ivan Allen]].<ref name="PresidentialOpinions"/>
On [[November 9]], [[1997]], the 'T' was nearly stolen from Tech Tower by five students wielding [[bolt cutters]] and [[rappelling]] equipment.<ref name="tbook" /> The students were caught by Georgia Tech police acting on a tip provided by an anonymous informant. Each student was required to pay $2,446.75 in damages, although criminal charges were not filed.<ref>{{cite news|first=Scott|last=Lange|url=http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/winter1998/feb6/news2.html|title=Kidnapped 'T' returns to Tech Tower|work=[[The Technique]]|date=[[1998-02-06]]|accessdate=2007-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{ cite news | title = 'T' thieves face the music | work = [[The Technique]] | last = Lange | first = Scott | url = http://technique.library.gatech.edu/issues/winter1998/feb13/news9.html | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | date = [[1998-02-13]] }}</ref>

One of the most theatrical thefts of the 'T' occurred over the summer of 1999. The 'T' on the north face of Tech Tower was stolen by a group of "six or seven people" on the morning of [[June 3]], [[1999]]. The perpetrators wrote a letter detailing the theft to the editorial staff of ''[[The Technique]]'', Georgia Tech's student newspaper. The letter, an abridged version of which was subsequently printed in the summer issue of ''The Technique'', described the process of stealing the 'T' by lowering it via a rope and moving it to a secret location. The letter also included a photograph of the 'T' "on vacation" in [[Bath (Berkeley Springs), West Virginia|Berkeley Springs, West Virginia]]. Finally, the perpetrators indicated plans to return the 'T' during the Georgia Tech Homecoming Parade, according to tradition, as long as no criminal charges would be brought against them. The letter was signed by fictitious Georgia Tech alumnus [[George P. Burdell]].<ref name="vacation">{{ cite news | last = Burdell | first = George P. | accessdate = 2007-05-19 | date=[[1999-07-09]] | work = [[The Technique]] | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-07-09/opinions/2 | title = Summer vacation isn't just for students and profs; why not let the 'T' have some fun now and then? }}</ref>

The same 'T' was stolen again on [[May 28]], [[2001]] by three students, two of whom were found guilty of numerous conduct code violations by the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet and subsequently suspended.<ref name="ujc"/> The students had successfully removed the 'T' from its mount but were caught by authorities when the removal triggered an alarm. In October 2005, a replica of the 'T' was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.<ref>{{cite news

The tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has inspired [[copycat crimes]] involving other signage on the Georgia Tech campus. In late 2001, a group of Georgia Tech students calling itself the "Caldwell Liberation Army" stole 32 'T's from signs on 16 campus buildings over a period of two nights. The students, who were not caught, vandalized the signs to express their bitterness at being displaced from Caldwell Residence Hall while renovations were taking place.<ref>{{ cite news | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2002-02-22/focus/1 | last = Adiga | first = Madhu | coauthors = Sriram Narasimha | title = When stealing only one <U+201C>T<U+201D> just won<U+2019>t do | work = [[The Technique]] | date = [[2002-02-22]] | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}</ref> In February 2006, it was noticed that small vinyl 'T' stickers were being stolen from informational signs located around the Georgia Tech campus, creating confusion for visitors and new students.<ref>{{ cite news | title = Tech tradition causes problems for students | work = [[The Technique]] | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2006-02-10/focus/1 | date = [[2006-02-10]] | accessdate = 2007-02-02 | last = Kaddi | first = Chanchala }}</ref>

===Institute reaction===
[[Image:StealingTechTowerT.jpg|thumb|right|Georgia Tech facilities workers replace the 'T' stolen in 2001]]
The Georgia Tech administration's position on stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has been varied. When the 'T' was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President Vernon Crawford was so upset he considered canceling classes until it was returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to [[turn a blind eye]] to the practice, with one president, [[John Patrick Crecine]], going so far as to endorse it.<ref name="PresidentialOpinions" />
{{cquote|I think stealing the <U+2018>T<U+2019> off the Tech Tower is among the all-time greatest rituals.}}
Today, stealing the 'T' is prohibited and is officially punishable with expulsion, although this has not happened in practice. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]] in 1999,<ref>{{ cite news | title = Accident on campus claims woman's life | url = http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-07-23/news/4 | date = [[1999-07-23]] | accessdate = 2007-02-01 | last = Dykes | first = Jennifer | work = [[The Technique]] }}</ref> Institute President [[G.
