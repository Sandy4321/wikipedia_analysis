'''Jonathan Pryce''' (born '''John Price'''; [[June 1]], [[1947]]) is a [[List of Welsh people|Welsh]] [[theatre|stage]] and [[film]] actor. He began his career as a stage actor in the late 1970s, after studying in the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] and getting married to [[Ireland|Irish]] actress [[Kate Fahy]] in 1974. His work in theater got him several supporting roles in film and television; these would eventually led him on to star in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s [[cult film]] ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]''.

He is known for being a versatile actor<ref>[http://london.broadway.com/story/id/3008926 London.broadway.com - Jonathan Pryce]Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[November 10]].</ref><ref>[http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=5986 Broadwayworld.com - Jonathan Pryce Confirmed To Step Into 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels']Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[November 10]].</ref> and has participated in box-office hits such as ''[[Evita (film)|Evita]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean films|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The New World]]'', as well as being involved in independant projects such as ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]'' and ''[[Carrington (film)|Carrington]]''. His career in theatre has also been prolific, and he has won two [[Tony Awards]] - the first in 1977 for his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in ''[[Comedians (play)|Comedians]]'', the second for his 1991 role as "the Engineer" in the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Miss Saigon]]''.

==Biography and career==
Pryce was born '''John Price''' in [[Holywell]], [[Flintshire]], [[Wales]] to Margaret Ellen ([[N<U+00E9>e]] Williams), a retail cashier and shopkeeper, and Isaac Price, a coal miner who also ran a small general grocery shop; he has two older sisters. Price was educated at Holywell Grammar School (today [[Holywell High School]]), after which he started training to be a teacher at [[Edge Hill College]] in [[Ormskirk]]. It was then that he became interested in acting and after taking drama classes, he won a scholarship to the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/northeast/guides/halloffame/showbiz/jonathan_pryce.shtml BBC.co.uk Jonathan Pryce] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[October 28]].</ref><ref>[http://www.tribute.ca/people/bio/2478 Tribute.ca - Jonathan Pryce] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[October 28]].</ref>

===1970s===
After graduating from the RADA, Pryce went on to perform with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and at the [[Nottingham Playhouse]] theatre. He then joined the [[Everyman Theatre|Everyman Theatre Liverpool Company]], eventually becoming the theatre's Artistic Director.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/03_march/06/sherlock_pryce.shtml BBC.co.uk Jonathan Pryce is Sherlock Holmes] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[October 28]].</ref><ref>[http://www.onsayfa.com/oyuncu/jonathan-pryce-t518.html Jonathan Pryce <U+00D6>n Sayfa] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[October 28]].</ref> While working at the Everyman Theatre Pryce met [[Ireland|Irish]] actress [[Kate Fahy]], the two got married in 1974.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/50/Jonathan-Pryce.html Filmreference.com Jonathan Pryce Biography (1947-)] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[October 28]].</ref> It is during this time that he made his first appearance on the screen, having a minor role on a 1972 episode of the British [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]] programme ''[[Doomwatch]]'', called ''Fire & Brimstone''. It was not until 1976, however, that he got his first movie role, playing ''Joseph Manasse'' in the film drama ''[[Voyage of the Damned]]'', starring [[Faye Dunaway]].

===1980s===
In 1980, his performance in the title role of [[Hamlet]] at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] won him an [[Olivier Award]], and was acclaimed by some critics as the definitive Hamlet of his generation.<ref>[http://www.rsc.org.uk/hamlet/about/stage.html ''Hamlet'' - Stage History] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[November 6]]</ref><ref>[http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/awards/winners Laurence Olivier Awards: Past winners] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[November 6|11-06]]</ref> That year he also appeared in the film ''[[Breaking Glass]]'', a film that is remarkable in that it also featured in the cast (sometimes in small roles) very many actors who would eventually become stars of film and television, actors such as [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Richard Griffiths]] and [[Phil Daniels]]; also during this year, Pryce had a small but pivotal role in the 12th episode of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' radio series, one that he reprised for the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]]'' which was broadcast in 2005.

After appearing mostly on TV films, such as ''[[Martin Luther, Heretic]]'', ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983 film)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' and the [[Ian McEwan]]-scripted film ''[[The Ploughman's Lunch]]'', he achieved a breakthrough with his role as the subdued protagonist Sam Lowry in the ex-[[Monty Python]] [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1985 film, ''[[Brazil (film)|Brazil]]''. The film, an analogy to [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s novel [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]], was acclaimed in Europe and won two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA Film Awards]]. In the [[United States|American]] version some scenes were removed by its distributor, [[Universal Pictures]], so as to make the film "shorter" and more consumer-friendly.<ref name="essay">{{cite journal | last = Matthews | first = Jack | title = Dreaming Brazil | journal = Essay accompanying DVD release by [[The Criterion Collection]]}}</ref> Despite being 43 minutes shorter than the original version, the movie was also well received in the United States and won three awards from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] and two [[Academy Awards]] nominations.

During this period of his life, Pryce continued to perform on stage, noteworthy as the successful but self-doubting writer Trigorin in a London production of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' in late 1985.<ref>[http://masterclass.org.uk/JonathanPryce_biog.asp Jonathan Pryce's Biography at the Theatre Royal Haymarket website] Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[November 26]]. </ref>

In 1988 Pryce worked once again with Terry Gilliam in ''[[The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', playing "[[The Right Honourable|The Right Ordinary]] Horatio Jackson".
