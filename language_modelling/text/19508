Germany is a [[Constitutional democracy|democratic]] parliamentary [[Federation|federal]] republic of 16 [[States of Germany|states]] ({{lang|de|''Bundesl<U+00E4>nder''}}). The country previously consisted of several sovereign states with their own history, culture, and religious affiliation.

==History==
{{main|History of Germany}}
===Antiquity===
{{main|Germanic peoples|Germania}}
The [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] is thought to have occurred during the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], or at the latest, during the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]]. The tribes began to extend south, east and west from southern [[Scandinavia]] and what is now northern Germany in the first century BC.<ref name="Claster">Jill N. Claster: ''Medieval Experience: 300-1400''. NYU Press 1982, p. 35. ISBN 0814713815</ref> Under [[Augustus]], the Roman General [[Publius Quinctilius Varus]] invaded Germania, and it was in this period that the Germanic tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare. Due to a series of defeats of Roman legions at the hands of Germanic forces, the greater part of what is now known Germany, as far as the Rhine and the Danube, remained outside the [[Roman Empire]]. By AD 100 Germanic tribes settled along the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers, occupying most of the area of modern Germany. The frontier was defined by the Rhine and Danube, and by a series of forts, the [[Limes Germanicus]]. The 3rd century saw the emergence of several large West Germanic tribes: [[Alamanni]], [[Franks]], [[Chatti]], [[Saxons]], [[Frisians]], [[Sicambri]], and [[Thuringii]]. Around AD 260, the Germanic peoples broke through the Roman frontier.<ref name="Cambridge ancient history">The Cambridge Ancient History, vol. 12, p. 442. ISBN 0521301998</ref>

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{main|Holy Roman Empire}}
[[Image: Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The seven [[prince-elector]]s of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. From a 1341 parchment]]
The [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Holy Roman Empire]] stemmed from the division in 843 of the [[Carolingian Empire]], which had been founded by [[Charlemagne]] in [[800]].  The Holy Roman Empire existed in varying forms until 1806, its territory stretching from the [[Eider River]] in the north to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast in the south. Under the reign of the [[Ottonian]] emperors (919&ndash;1024), the [[Stem duchy|duchies]] of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Bavaria]] were consolidated, and the German king was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of these regions in 962. Under the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] and [[Hohenstaufen]] emperors, the empire absorbed northern [[Italy]] and [[Burgundy]] and extended its influence south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. During this period northern German towns grew prosperous as members of the [[Hanseatic League]]. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] provided the basic constitution of the empire until its dissolution. It codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics. From the 15th century onwards, the emperors were elected nearly exclusively from the [[Habsburg]] dynasty of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].

In 1517 the monk [[Martin Luther]] wrote [[95 Theses]] questioning the [[Roman Catholic Church]], thereby sparking the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church emerged and became established in many states of Germany, following the example of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1530. Religious conflict led to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618&ndash;1648), which devastated German lands. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) ended religious warfare in Germany, but the empire was greatly weakened by its ''de facto'' division into numerous independent principalities. From 1740 onward, the century-old [[France-Habsburg rivalry]] was replaced by a dualism between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and a new power, the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. As a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the Holy Roman Empire was overrun and dissolved in 1806.<ref name="concise h">Fulbrook, Mary: ''A Concise History of Germany'', Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 97.

===Revolution and Second German Empire===
{{main|German Confederation|German Empire}}
Following the fall of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] convened in 1814 and founded the [[German Confederation]], a loose league of [[List of German Confederation member states|39 sovereign states]].  The rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] and [[nationalism|nationalist]] movements was in part a consequence of disagreement with restoration politics. These movements were subject to repression by the Austrian statesman, [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] but a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]] were started by intellectuals, culminating in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. The monarchs initially yielded to the revolutionaries' liberal demands and King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, though with a loss of power. He rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the revolutionary movement. In the [[Second War of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], the new [[Prime Minister of Prussia]] who had been appointed in 1862, gained control over [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. The territory was then jointly administered with the [[Austrian Empire]], but tensions between the two powers soon led to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. A quick Prussian victory enabled Bismarck to create the [[North German Confederation]] and to exclude [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] from the affairs of the remaining Southern German states, which had supported Austria.

[[Image:Reichsgruendung2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Foundation of modern Germany at Versailles in 1871. [[Bismarck]] is in white in the middle. Painting by [[Anton Alexander von Werner]], 1877]]
The French Emperor declared the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870 but was defeated by Prussian and Southern German forces. The effect of the French attack was to unify the German states under Prussian leadership. [[German Empire]] (''Deutsches Kaiserreich'') was proclaimed in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] on [[January 18]] [[1871]]. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the dynasty of Prussia, ruled the new empire, whose capital was [[Berlin]]. The empire encompassed all previously scattered parts of Germany except Austria, a concept known as [[Kleindeutsche L<U+00F6>sung|''Kleindeutschland'']], or "Lesser Germany". In the ''[[Gr<U+00FC>nderzeit]]'' (Founding Era) following this [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy secured Germany's position as a great power by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] through diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Nevertheless, Germany also set upon an [[imperialism|imperialistic]] course [[New Imperialism|like other European powers]] and in 1884 began establishing [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] outside Europe. These actions eventually caused friction with neighbouring countries, such that most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed and new alliances excluded the country. Significantly, France established new relationships by signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and securing ties with the [[Russian Empire]]. Consequently, apart from its contacts with [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany became increasingly isolated.

The [[Assassination in Sarajevo|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Austria's crown prince]] on [[July 28]] [[1914]] triggered a series of events leading to [[World War I]]. Fearing attack by Russia, Germany tried to first eliminate Russia's ally, France, by invading via [[Belgium]] but thereby also brought the [[United Kingdom]] into the conflict. Fighting on two fronts, Germany, as part of the unsuccessful [[Central Powers]], suffered defeat at the hands of the [[Allies|Allied Powers]] in [[World War I casualties|one of the bloodiest]] conflicts of all time. The [[German Revolution]] broke out in November 1918, and Emperor William II and all German ruling princes [[Abdication|abdicated]]. An [[Armistice with Germany (Compi<U+00E8>gne)|armistice]] putting an end to the war was signed on [[November 11]], and Germany was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919. Its negotiation, contrary to traditional post-war diplomacy, excluded the defeated Central Powers. Germans resented what they called the Versailles ''diktat'', and its harshness is often cited as having facilitated the later rise of [[Nazism]].<ref name="lee h">Stephen J. Lee: ''Europe, 1890-1945''. Routledge 2003, p. 131. ISBN 0415254558</ref> After the success of the [[German Revolution]] in November 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed. The [[Weimar Constitution]] came into effect with its signing by [[President of Germany|President]] [[Friedrich Ebert]] on [[August 11]], [[1919]]. The [[Communist Party of Germany|German Communist Party]] was established by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]] in 1918, and the German Workers Party, later known as the National Socialist German Workers Party or [[Nazi Party]], was founded in January 1919.

===Nazi Germany===
{{main|Nazi Germany|History of Germany during World War II}}
Suffering from the [[Great Depression]], the harsh peace conditions dictated by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and a long succession of more or less unstable governments, the political masses in Germany increasingly lacked identification with the country's system of [[parliamentary democracy]]. This was exacerbated by a widespread right-wing ([[Monarchism|monarchist]], ''[[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement|v<U+00F6>lkisch]]'', and [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]) ''[[Dolchsto<U+00DF>legende]]'' (backstabbing legend), a political myth which claimed that Germany lost World War I because of domestic treachery rather than military failure. On the other hand, radical left-wing [[communism|communists]] such as the [[Spartacist League]] sought to abolish what they perceived as "[[Capitalism|capitalist rule]]" in favour of a ''[[Council communism|R<U+00E4>terepublik]]'' of workers' councils. Paramilitary forces were assembled by several parties and thousands of politically motivated murders occurred. These forces intimidated voters and seeded violence and anger among the public, which suffered from high unemployment and poverty. After a succession of unsuccessful cabinets, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], seeing few alternatives and pushed by right-wing advisors, appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Chancellor of Germany]] on [[January 29]], [[1933]].

[[Image:Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] with [[Benito Mussolini]] in Axis-occupied [[Yugoslavia]]]]
Basic democratic rights were quickly abrogated under an [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] after the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was set on fire]] on [[February 27]], [[1933]]. An already persecuted and fragmented opposition was completely neutralized by the passing of the [[Enabling Act]] on [[23 March]], [[1933]] through the [[Reichstag]], giving Hitler's government full legislative power.<ref name="Stackelberg">Roderick Stackelberg, ''Hitler's Germany: origins, interpretations, legacies''.

Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]]</ref> A centralized [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[single-party state]] was established, and industry was closely regulated in order to set the economy on a war footing. In violation of the Treaty of Versailles, German troops entered the demilitarized [[Rhineland]] in 1936, but there were no repercussions from the Treaty's signatories. Emboldened by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] policies, Hitler followed a policy of [[expansionism]] to establish [[Gro<U+00DF>deutschland|Greater Germany]], beginning with the annexations of [[Anschluss|Austria]], the [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland]], and the [[Memel Territory]]. To avoid another war on two fronts, he concluded the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] in August 1939. In what later became known as the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], the Nazi regime enacted governmental policies directly subjugating many sectors of society: [[Jew]]s, [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Roma people|Roma]], [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[Freemasonry|freemasons]], political dissidents, priests, preachers, religious opponents, and the [[disability|disabled]], amongst others. About 11 million people were murdered in the Holocaust, including more than 6 million Jews.<ref>Schwartz, Terese.

Its [[Causes of World War II|territorial ambitions]] led [[Nazi Germany]] to launch a [[blitzkrieg]] against Poland on [[September 1]], [[1939]]. Two days later the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. However Germany quickly gained direct or indirect control of most of [[Western Europe]], with the exception of the [[United Kingdom]]. On [[June 22]], [[1941]], Hitler broke the pact with the Soviet Union by opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invading the Soviet Union]]. Germany declared war on the [[United States]] four days after [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the American base at Pearl Harbor]]. Although the German army rapidly advanced into the surprised [[Soviet Union]], the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] marked a major turning point in the war. The German army then began to retreat on the Eastern Front. Heavy aerial bombardment by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[U.S. Air Force]], and the opening of a new front after a massive [[D-Day|invasion]] in [[Normandy]] by American, British and Canadian forces put further pressure on Germany. After the [[Red Army]] occupied [[Berlin]], [[Victory in Europe Day|Germany surrendered]] on [[May 8]], [[1945]].

===Division and reunification (1945-90)===
{{main|History of Germany since 1945}}
[[Image:Adenauer.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Konrad Adenauer]], the first [[Chancellor of Germany]] after World War II]]
The war resulted in the deaths of nearly ten million German soldiers and civilians, the destruction of major German cities, and [[Oder-Neisse line|large territorial losses]] to East European countries. [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|The expulsion of about 15 million Germans]] from these territories resulted in additional chaos and loss of life. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] partitioned Germany and [[Berlin]] into four military occupation zones. The sectors controlled by [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] were merged to form the ''Federal Republic of Germany'' on [[May 23]], [[1949]]; the Soviet Union established the ''German Democratic Republic'' on [[October 7]], [[1949]]. The two states were known informally as "[[West Germany]]" and "[[East Germany]]", respectively.

West Germany, with its capital in [[Bonn]], established a liberal [[parliamentary republic]] with a "[[social market economy]]" and was allied with the U.S., the UK, and France. The country came to enjoy prolonged economic growth from the early 1950s, known as ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]''. The recovery occurred largely because of the previously forbidden currency reform of June 1948, and from 1949 onwards partly through U.S. assistance in the form of [[Marshall Plan]] loans.<ref>Henderson, David.

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which included the ''de facto'' acceptance of Germany's territorial losses in World War II. 

[[Image:Berlin-wall-dancing.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Berlin Wall]] that had partitioned [[Berlin]] in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] shortly after the opening of the wall]] 
In the face of mass demonstrations and a growing migration of East Germans to West Germany via [[Hungary]], East German authorities unexpectedly eased the border restrictions in November 1989, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West. This accelerated the reform process in East Germany. [[German reunification]] occurred on [[October 3]], [[1990]] under the political leadership of West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], with Berlin again becoming the capital. The reunited Germany has taken a leading role in the European Union and NATO.

Germany is a [[Federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[Representative democracy|representative]] [[Democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 [[Constitution|constitutional document]] known as the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]] ("[[Basic Law]]"). Amendments to the Grundgesetz require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the articles guaranteeing fundamental rights, a democratic state, and the right to resist attempts to overthrow the constitution are valid in perpetuity and cannot be amended.<ref>[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_79.html Article 79 of the ''Grundgesetz'']</ref> The Grundgesetz remained in effect, with minor amendments, after [[German reunification]] in 1990. 

The [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] is the [[head of government]] and exercises [[Executive (government)|executive power]]. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]], comprised of the [[Bundestag]] ("[[Diet (assembly)|Federal Diet]]") and [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] ("[[Federal Council]]"). The Bundestag is elected through [[direct election]]s; the members of the Bundesrat represent the governments of the 16 [[States of Germany|federal states]] and are members of the state cabinets, which appoint them and can remove them at any time.

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] U.S. Library of Congress. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 7|12-07]]</ref> although smaller parties, such as the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (which has had members in the Bundestag since 1949) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (which has controlled seats in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. 

The German [[head of state]] is the [[President of Germany]], elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates. The second highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the [[President of the Bundestag]], who is elected by the Bundestag itself. He is responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the [[chancellor]]. He or she is nominated by the President of Germany and elected by the Bundestag. If necessary, he or she can be removed by a constructive [[motion of no confidence]] of the Bundestag, with ''constructive'' referring to the fact that the Bundestag has to elect a successor in such a case.

[[Image:Karlsruhe bundesverfassungsgericht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] in [[Karlsruhe]]]]

The [[Judiciary of Germany]] is independent of the executive and the legislative branches. Germany has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil or statute law system]] that is based on [[Roman law]] with some references to [[Germanic law]]. Legislative power is divided between the Federation and the individual federated states. [[Criminal law]] and [[private law]] are codified on the national level in the ''[[Strafgesetzbuch]]'' and the ''[[B<U+00FC>rgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' respectively. Many of the fundamental matters in [[administrative law]] remain in the jurisdiction of the individual federated states, though most states follow the 1976 ''Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz'' (Administrative Proceedings Law) in important points of administrative law. Germany's supreme court system is specialized. For civil and criminal cases, the highest court of appeal is the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|''Bundesgerichtshof'']] (Federal Court of Justice), located in [[Karlsruhe]]. The courtroom style is [[Inquisitorial system|inquisitorial]]. The  ''[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'' (Federal Constitutional Court), also located in Karlsruhe, is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [[judicial review]]. It acts as the highest legal authority and ensures that legislative and judicial practice conforms to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution]]. It acts independently of the other state bodies, but cannot act on its own behalf.

Germany has played a leading role in the [[European Union]] since its inception and has maintained a [[Franco-German cooperation|strong alliance with France]] since the end of World War II.

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Germany}}
[[Image:Deutschland topo.png|thumb|right|Altitude levels]]
Germany has the largest population in Europe, after the European parts of Russia, and is seventh in area. The territory of Germany covers [[1 E11 m<U+00B2>|357,021]] [[square kilometre|km<U+00B2>]] (137,850 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]), of which land makes up 349,223 km<U+00B2> (134,835 mi<U+00B2>) and water makes up 7,798 km<U+00B2> (3,010 mi<U+00B2>). Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at 2,962&nbsp;m (9,718&nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|ft]])) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (Nordsee) in the north-west and the [[Baltic Sea]] (Ostsee) in the north-east. Between lie the forested uplands of central Germany and the low-lying lands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at 3.54 metres (11.6&nbsp;ft) below sea level), traversed by some of Europe's major [[river]]s such as the [[Rhine]], [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].<ref name="CIA">[https://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/gm.html Germany] CIA Factbook. Nov. 14, 2006. Retrieved [[2006]], [[November 29|11-29]]</ref> Because of its central location, Germany shares borders with more European countries than any other country on the continent. Its neighbours are [[Denmark]] in the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] in the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] in the south, [[France]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the south-west and [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the north-west.

[[Image:Karwendel-Ahornboden.jpg|thumb|left|The scenery in the Alps of southern [[Bavaria]]]]
Most of Germany has a cool, temperate climate in which humid westerly winds predominate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], which is the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the [[North Sea]] including the peninsula of [[Jutland]] in north Germany and the area along the [[Rhein]], which flows into the [[North Sea]]. Consequently in the north-west and the north, the climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]]; [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs year round with a maximum during summer. [[winter|Winters]] there are mild and [[summer]]s tend to be cool, though temperatures can exceed 30 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]] (86 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]]) for prolonged periods. In the east, the climate is more [[continental climate|continental]]; winters can be very cold, summers can be very warm, and long dry periods are often recorded. Central and the southern Germany is a transition region which varies from moderately oceanic to continental. The maximum temperature can exceed 30 <U+00B0>C (86 <U+00B0>F) in summer.<ref>[http://www.handbuch-deutschland.de/book/en/002_001_001.html German Climate] Handbuch Deutschland.

Germany is often called ''das Land der Dichter und Denker'' (the land of poets and thinkers).<ref>Wasser, Jeremy. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,410135,00.html Sp<U+00E4>tzle Westerns] Spiegel Online International. Apr. 6, 2006. Retrieved [[2006]], [[December 6|12-06]]</ref> German culture began long before the rise of Germany as a [[nation-state]] and spanned the entire [[German language|German speaking]] world. From its roots, culture in Germany has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and secular. As a result, it is difficult to identify a specific German tradition separated from the larger context of European [[high culture]].<ref>[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576917_4/Germany.html Federal Republic of Germany: Culture.] Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2006. Retrieved [[2007]], [[January 2|01-02]]</ref> German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]. Various German authors and poets have won great renown including [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]. The collections of folk tales published by the [[Brothers Grimm]] popularized German folklore on the international level.  Germany's [[German philosophy|influence on philosophy]] is historically significant and many [[List of German-language philosophers|notable German philosophers]] have helped shape [[western philosophy]] since the Middle Ages. [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s contributions to [[rationalism]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s establishment of [[German idealism]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s formulation of [[Communist theory]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s development of [[Perspectivism]] were especially influential.

Numerous German painters have enjoyed international prestige through their work in diverse artistic currents. [[Matthias Gr<U+00FC>newald|Gr<U+00FC>newald]] and [[Albrecht D<U+00FC>rer|D<U+00FC>rer]] were important artists of the [[Renaissance]], [[Caspar David Friedrich|Friedrich]] of [[Romanticism]], and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]] of [[Surrealism]]. [[Architecture|Architectural]] contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were important precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. The region later became the site for significant works in styles such as [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modern movement]], especially through the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. German cinema dates back to the very early years of the medium with the work of [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky]]. It was particularly influential during the years of the [[Weimar Republic]] with [[German expressionism|German expressionists]] such as [[Robert Wiene|Wiene]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|Murnau]]. [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schl<U+00F6>ndorff|Schl<U+00F6>ndorff]] and [[Werner Herzog|Herzog]], and films such as [[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' (2003)'', have enjoyed international success.
