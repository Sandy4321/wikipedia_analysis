'''William Graily Hewit''' or '''Graily Hewitt'''  (1864-1952)  was a British  novelist and calligrapher, second only to [[Edward Johnston]] in  importance to the revival of [[calligraphy]] in the country at the turn of the twentieth century.

Hewitt was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Venn|id=HWT883WG|name=Hewitt, William Graily}}</ref> First training as a [[lawyer]], he interrupted his career to write   a novel and a volume of [[short stories]]. He later attended  Edward Johnston's* evening classes at the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]]  and  quickly became a teacher there , and at the [[Camberwell School of Art]], taking up Johnston's previous work. Hewitt remained  at the Central School until the 1920s and 1930s,  publishing together with Johnston throughout the early part of the century and working with a series of other illuminators  over the decades.

Hewitt was central to the revival of [[gilding]] in calligraphy , and his prolific output on type design also appeared between 1915 and 1943 .   His contributions to ''Writing, illuminating and Lettering'' and his guide ''Lettering for Students & Craftsmen (1930)'' are considered particularly crucial to  the revival of gilding. He is attributed with the  revival of  gilding with [[gesso]] and gold leaf on [[vellum]]. Elements of Hewitt's work are included in a variety of manuscript books. He was  one of the initiators  of the Society of Scribes and Illuminators,  in 1921.

Hewitt sought to link  calligraphy and [[type design]], arguing  that type should represent creations of pen. The Treyford Type, employed for  The Pen and Type Design, was a design of Hewitt's. He also created  a series  of initials for St. John Hornby's Ashendene Press, during the long period 1902 to 1935. He  continued calligraphy up  to his death on December 22, 1952  aged 88.

His work is kept in the  [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]'s collection.
