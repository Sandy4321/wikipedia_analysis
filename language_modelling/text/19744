'''Orlando "Tubby" Smith''' (born {{birth date|1951|6|30}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[college basketball]] coach. He is currently the men's basketball head coach at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Smith previously served in the same role at the [[University of Tulsa]], the [[University of Georgia]], and most recently, [[University of Kentucky]], where he coached the Wildcats to the [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998 NCAA championship]].

Over his 18 seasons as a head coach, Smith has had 16 twenty-win seasons. In 2005, he joined [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]], [[Nolan Richardson]], [[Denny Crum]] and [[Jim Boeheim]] as the only head coaches to win 365 games in 15 seasons or less. Entering the 2007 season, Smith's career record was 387-145 and his .733 winning percentage was eighth among active coaches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tubby Smith Named Head Basketball Coach at University of Minnesota|url=http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=38661&SPID=3302&DB_OEM_ID=8400&ATCLID=832303|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>  With Minnesota's invite to the 2009 NCAA tournament, Smith became the fifth coach to lead four different teams to the NCAA tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gophers' Smith on brink of NCAA berth with fourth school|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/lopresti/2009-03-13-tubby-smith_N.htm|accessdate=2009-03-15 | work=USA Today | date=2009-03-14}}</ref>

==Early years==
Smith was born in [[Scotland, Maryland]], in [[Saint Mary's County, Maryland|Saint Mary's County]], is the sixth of 17 children born to [[sharecropping|sharecroppers]] Guffrie and Parthenia Smith. His large family accounts for his unusual nickname. Of all the Smith children, Tubby was most fond of staying in the galvanized washtub where the children were bathed. Smith says he tried to shake the moniker several times, but it stuck incessantly. He recalls that a 10<sup>th</sup> grade teacher who didn't tolerate nicknames was the last person to call him by his proper name, Orlando.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/03/20/spt_wwwtubby.html |title=Sweet redemption for UK's Smith |last=Wilstein |first=Steve |publisher=''The Cincinnati Post'' |date=2003-03-20 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

After having a scholarship offer from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] rescinded, Smith enrolled at High Point College (now [[High Point University]]), graduating in [[1973]]. He played under three different head coaches at High Point, including future boss [[J. D. Barnett]]. He lettered four times and was an all-conference performer as a senior. Smith earned a Bachelor of Science degree in health and physical education while at High Point, and also met his future wife, Donna, who was the [[homecoming queen]].<ref name=ukhpnotes>{{cite web |url=http://story.scout.com/a.z?s=218&p=2&c=472123 |title=Kentucky, High Point Game Notes |publisher=Scout.com |date=2005-11-28 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

After a brief stint in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kykernel.com/media/storage/paper305/news/2005/11/29/Sports/Smith.Thankful.For.Alma.Mater.Experience-1115175.shtml?norewrite200701121043&sourcedomain=www.kykernel.com |title=Smith thankful for alma mater experience |last=Wood |first=Ryan |publisher=''The Kentucky Kernel'' |date=2005-11-29 |accessdate=2007-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Smith began his coaching career with a four-year stint at his high school ''[[alma mater]]'' - [[Great Mills High School]] in [[Great Mills, Maryland]], compiling a 46-36 record. His next stop was Hoke County High School in [[Raeford, North Carolina]], where he recorded a 28-18 mark in two seasons.<ref name=uka.com />

==Assistant coaching positions==
===Virginia Commonwealth University===
At the college level, Smith began as assistant coach at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] under his former High Point coach [[J. D. Barnett]]. From 1979 to 1986, VCU amassed a 144-64 record, winning three [[Sun Belt Conference]] Championships.<ref name=uka.com /> 

Smith took two important things away from his experience as an assistant coach for the Rams. First, under Barnett, Smith learned the principles of the ball-line defense, a hallmark of Smith's teams throughout his head coaching career.<ref name=uka.com /> Second was a relationship with fellow assistant David Hobbs, an assistant and associate head coach under Smith during his tenure at the [[University of Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vcurams.vcu.edu/generalnew/hobbs_alumnistar.html |title=Former Ram Now Prowls Wildcat Sideline |publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University |date=2006-01-05 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

===University of South Carolina===
Smith left Virginia Commonwealth in 1986 to join George Felton's staff at the [[University of South Carolina]]. Felton remembered Smith from having recruited one of his players while Smith was at Hoke High School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kernel.uky.edu/1998/spring/02/19/spt42.shtml |title=The nomadic coach: Felton leaves Oregon to work with a friend in Lexington |last=Mosolgo |first=Eric |publisher=''The Kentucky Kernel'' |date=1998-02-19 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> During Smith's three years, the [[South Carolina Gamecocks|Gamecocks]] were 53-35.<ref name=uka.com /> Later, roles would be reversed, with Smith bringing Felton in as an assistant coach at Kentucky.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.kypost.com/sports/tubby061897.html |title=Smith assembles UK staff |work=[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]] ([[Associated Press]]) |publisher=[[E. W. Scripps Company]] |date=1997-06-18 |accessdate=2007-01-12|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051104112455/http://www.kypost.com/sports/tubby061897.html| archivedate=2005-11-04}}</ref>

===University of Kentucky===
Smith joined the [[University of Kentucky]] under then head coach [[Rick Pitino]], who had the challenge of rebuilding a UK program that had been rocked by NCAA probation and player defections.

With only eight scholarship student-athletes, none taller than 6-7, the staff molded the Cats into winners once again, exceeding expectations to record a 14-14 mark. The following year, with Smith promoted to associate coach and UK still on probation, the Wildcats earned a 22-6 record, a final ranking of ninth in the AP poll, and an SEC-best 14-4 record.

Smith wasn't the only soon-to-be high profile name on Pitino's coaching staff at Kentucky. Future head coaches [[Ralph Willard]], [[Herb Sendek]], [[Billy Donovan]], and Bernadette Locke-Mattox were all Smith's colleagues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibaawards.com/index.cfm?id=8&partid=47 |title=Tubby Smith - 2002 Keynote |publisher=Rotary Club of Tulsa |accessdate=2007-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Head Coaching Stops==
===University of Tulsa===
From 1991 to 1995, Smith led the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's basketball|Golden Hurricane]] to a 79-43 record. Rebuilding the basketball program his first two years, he then led the team to two consecutive [[Missouri Valley Conference]] regular season titles and two appearances in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 1994 and 1995. Smith's 1994 Tulsa team upset UCLA in the tourney's first round before knocking off Oklahoma State. In '95, the Golden Hurricane defeated Big Ten team Illinois to open March Madness.

===University of Georgia===
On March 29, 1995, Smith accepted the head coaching job at the [[University of Georgia]], becoming the school's first [[African-American]] head coach.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2D6173AF933A05750C0A963958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fU%2fUniversity%20of%20Tulsa |title=Smith Is Leaving Tulsa To Coach at Georgia |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=1995-03-30 |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> In two seasons, he led the [[Georgia Bulldogs|Bulldogs]] to a 45-19 record, including the first back-to-back seasons of 20 wins or more in school history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/tubby_smith_bio.html |title=Tubby Smith 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Assistant Coach |publisher=USA Basketball |accessdate=2007-01-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070101141415/http://www.usabasketball.com/biosmen/tubby_smith_bio.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-01-01}}</ref>  His teams achieved a [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]] finish in the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 NCAA Tournament]] and lost in the first round of the [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1997 NCAA Tournament]]. The Bulldogs defeated Clemson to open the '96 tournament before upsetting the top-seeded Purdue Boilermakers.

===University of Kentucky===
Tubby Smith was introduced as the Wildcats' 20<sup>th</sup> head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the task of replacing popular coach [[Rick Pitino]], who left to become the head coach of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Boston Celtics]]. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and played in the national title game in 1997. The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/03-98/03-26-98/d05sp272.htm |title=Final Four coaches savor first-time experience |last=Shannon |first=Kelley |publisher=''South Coast Today'' |accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

In his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the [[Elite Eight]]. His 1998 national championship is unique in modern times, as being the only team in over twenty years to win without a first-team All-American or future NBA lottery pick. (see [[1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1998 NCAA Tournament]]).

Smith's teams, known primarily for a defense-oriented slower style of play coined "Tubbyball", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. 

Smith led Kentucky to one national championship in 1998, a perfect 16<U+2013>0 regular season conference record in 2003 (as well as being named national AP Coach of the Year), five SEC regular season championships (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004), with six Sweet Sixteen finishes and four Elite Eight finishes (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his nine seasons after the 1998 championship. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach except Hall of Fame member [[Adolph Rupp]], reaching the plateau in 130 games.

Although Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his recruiting was subpar and his failure to achieve a Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. Some UK fans went as far as to place "for sale" signs on his front lawn.  He did come just a double overtime loss short of a Final Four appearance in 2005, losing to Tom Izzo's Michigan State Spartans. This drought is the longest of any coach in UK history. Smith struggled to land many top recruits. In one instance he passed up McDonald's All-American Corey Brewer saying Brewer was too skinny to play in the SEC. Smith, instead, opted for the more robust Perry Stevenson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17631234 |title=Tubby should keep job, despite spoiled fans |last=Davis |first=Ken |publisher=''MSNBC'' |accessdate=2007-09-11}}</ref>  That along with his double digit losing seasons (which led to Tubby's critics nicknaming him "Ten-Loss Tubby") led to the pressure.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bracket.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/17/bluegrass-controversy |title=Bluegrass Controversy |last=Evans |first=Thayer |publisher=''New York Times'' |accessdate=2007-09-11 | date=2007-03-17}}</ref> On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK head coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2808406 ESPN - Smith leaving Kentucky to coach Minnesota - Men's College Basketball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Smith led the Wildcats to an overall record of 263<U+2013>83 record for a winning percentage of .760. In his 10 seasons with Kentucky, he averaged over 26 wins per season.<ref name=gs.com/>

===University of Minnesota===
Smith was hired as the new men's head coach of the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|University of Minnesota]] on March 22, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/myfox/pages/Sports/Detail?contentId=2741881&version=5&locale=EN-US&layoutCode=TSTY&pageId=6.1.1 |title=Tubby Smith to Coach Gophers |last=Durkin |first=Michael |publisher=''Minnesota Fox 9 News'' |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref> 
He replaced [[Dan Monson]] who resigned from Minnesota on November 30, 2006 and [[Jim Molinari]] who had been serving as the [[interim management|interim]] coach since Monson's resignation. Coach Smith joined [[Minnesota]] after several disappointing seasons for the Gophers. Since Monson was brought in from [[Gonzaga Bulldogs|Gonzaga]] on July 4, 1999 to rebuild a Minnesota program scandalized by academic fraud during [[Clem Haskins]]' regime, the Gophers made the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] just one time, and in 2007 endured the first twenty loss season in their history.

The team went from 8<U+2013>22 in 2006<U+2013>07 to 20<U+2013>14 in 2007<U+2013>08. Smith also led his Golden Gophers to the Big Ten Tournament semi-finals after defeating 2nd seeded Indiana. Coach Smith also harvested a top 25 recruiting class, the best in years for the program.  In the 2008<U+2013>09 season, Tubby led Minnesota to a record of 22<U+2013>11, culminating in a berth in the NCAA tournament. In the 2009-10 season, Smith's team struggled throughout the year with off court issues and close losses. However, in the Big Ten Tournament, Smith guided the team to win 3 games in 3 days (one in overtime) to advance to Minnesota's first ever appearance in the Big Ten championship game. They would lose to regular season co-champion Ohio State and player of the year candidate Evan Turner. The team's efforts were not all for naught, as their impressive run vaulted them into the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year.

As of the 2009-10 season, Smith has 17 consecutive 20-win seasons.

In 2008, Smith had the highest salary of any state employee in [[Minnesota]].<ref>Howatt, Glenn - "[http://www.startribune.com/local/25555194.html?location_refer=Homepage Quick, find the 1,425 people who earn more than the guv]" [[Star Tribune]], July 17, 2008. "The highest paid include county attorneys and medical examiners, a zoo director, state treatment center medical workers and more than 800 university professors. And earning the most among this group was Gophers basketball coach Tubby Smith at $1 million."</ref>

==U.S. Olympic Basketball==
Smith was selected to help coach the 2000 [[United States men's national basketball team|U.S. Olympic men's basketball team]] in [[Sydney]]. He served as an assistant to then-[[Houston Rockets]] coach [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] as the Americans met the high expectations set for them, capturing the gold medal. 

Currently, he serves on the NCAA Committee to study basketball issues, joining [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]'s [[Mike Krzyzewski]] and former [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] head coach [[Ernie Kent]]. He serves on the National Association of Basketball Coaches Board of Directors and in June 2000, spoke at a Congressional hearing on the issue of gambling in college sports.

==Personal life==
Smith has been very active in the [[Lexington, Kentucky]] community. The Tubby Smith Foundation, which he established to assist underprivileged children, has raised over $1.5 million in the past 5 years. Also, several community centers in the greater Lexington area bear the moniker "Tubby's Clubhouse" due to his work within the centers.
