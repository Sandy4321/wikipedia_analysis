The '''Mount Lindesay Highway''' is an [[Australia]]n national [[highway]] located in [[Queensland]], also known as National Route 13. The highway runs southwest from [[Brisbane]], where it leaves [[Ipswich Road, Brisbane|Ipswich Road]] in the suburb of [[Moorooka, Queensland|Moorooka]] (as Beaudesert Road to the [[Logan Motorway]]), to the Queensland &ndash; [[New South Wales]] border and is approximately {{convert|129|km}} in length.

==Location and route==
[[Image:Mount Lindesay Australia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Mount Lindesay (Queensland)|Mount Lindesay]], located adjacent to the Mount Lindesay Highway.]]
Until 1977, the Mount Lindesay Highway as a named road extended beyond the Queensland &ndash; New South Wales border to [[Tenterfield]] but the New South Wales section of the road, which still includes some unpaved portions, was decommissioned as a highway by the New South Wales Government due to very low traffic volumes. Approximately {{convert|8|km}} south of the Queensland &ndash; New South Wales border the decommissioned part of the Mount Lindesay Highway intersects the northern end of the [[Summerland Way]], known as New South Wales route B91, which runs south to [[Casino, New South Wales|Casino]] and then on to [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]].

South of [[Rathdowney, Queensland|Rathdowney]] the highway becomes very winding as it climbs the [[McPherson Range]]. However it is a scenic road, and connects to the northern end of the [[Lions Road]], a scenic drive between [[Innisplain, Queensland|Innisplain]] and the Summerland Way just south of [[Roseberry, New South Wales|Roseberry]], passing [[Mount Chinghee National Park]] and [[Border Ranges National Park]] on the way. 

The highway is named after [[Mount Lindesay (Queensland)|Mount Lindesay]], the residue of a solidified [[magma]] core, that is part of the [[Mount Warning]] [[volcanic]] area and is situated in the western extreme of Border Ranges National Park.

Until the 1950s it formed part of the main traffic route between Brisbane and [[Sydney]]. The coastal route (now the [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]]) was not favoured due to the large number of ferry crossings of the wide coastal rivers, the frequency and severity of flooding of these rivers and the consequent poor state of much of the road for extended periods, and its steep, winding nature as it crossed the intermediate hills between each river valley. In the mid-1950s a sealed road was constructed west from [[Boonah, Queensland|Boonah]] through [[Cunninghams Gap]] to [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]], and this supplanted the Mount Lindesay Highway as the main Brisbane &ndash; Sydney traffic route as far south as Tenterfield. This in turn has since the 1980s been supplanted by the Pacific Highway as the major Brisbane &ndash; Sydney route, as a result of extensive upgrading and deviations of the Pacific Highway.

Between 2007 and 2009 {{convert|4.5|km}} of the highway in the [[Logan City|Logan City local government area]] was upgraded.<ref name="rc">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadconstruct.com.au/news/mount-lindesay-highway-upgrade-in-logan-completed|title=Mount Lindesay Highway upgrade in Logan completed|author=Gomez, Kevin|accessdate=16 July 2010|date=7 December 2009|work=Road Construct|publisher=Reed Business Information }}</ref> As well as providing dual carraigeways, the work included building service roads so that local traffic does not have to travel on the main carriageways, thereby reducing congestion.
