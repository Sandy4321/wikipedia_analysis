'''''Poquita Ropa''''' ({{lang-en|''Few Clothes''}}) is the twelfth [[studio album]] by [[Guatemala]]n [[singer]]-[[songwriter]] [[Ricardo Arjona]]. It was released on August 24, 2010 through [[Warner Music]]. It was recorded in [[Mexico City]], [[New York]], and [[Los Angeles]] and was produced by Lee Levin and Dan Warner under their production name Los Gringo, with additional works from [[Matt Rollings]] and [[Brian Lang]].

A drastic change from his previous albums, ''Poquita Ropa'' was produced trying to use the least number of [[musical instrument]]s as possible. Arjona's goal was to produce the songs "almost as they were born", this was done by using nonexistent sounds giving them a more acoustic-feel. With this, the singer achieved a production style that seemed to be [[a capella]] performances, commenting that "music and women look better with little clothes."

Critically and commercially successful, it became his third number-one set on the [[Billboard Top Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Top Latin Albums]] and Latin Pop Albums chart, and also topped the lists in [[CAPIF|Argentina]] and [[AMPROFON|Mexico]]. The album was certified Platinum in Argentina and Mexico, and reached Gold status in Chile, Colombia and the United States. The album was nominated at the [[53rd Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album|Best Latin Pop Album]]. ''Poquita Ropa'' was given generally positive reviews. Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] considered the album a "stripped-down acoustic effort" though stating that it was "impressive".

''Poquita Ropa'' spawned three singles. "[[Puente (song)|Puente]]", a song with Cuban influences, was released as the [[lead single]] off the album and peaked at No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' [[Latin Pop Songs]] chart. The other two singles released were "[[Vida (song)|Vida]]" and "[[Marta (song)|Marta]]", both of which failed to gain success on charts. Instead of embarking on another worldwide tour, Arjona promoted the album with an eponymous film. It was broadcasted on [[HBO]] and [[A&E Network|A&E]], and were directed by Joaqu<U+00ED>n Cambre, and features Mexican [[Soap opera|telenovela]] actress [[Edith Gonz<U+00E1>lez]].

In ''Poquita Ropa'', Arjona drastically changed his musical style. Arjona tried to use the least number of instruments as possible. The result was a production that seems to be a capella performances. Arjona has commented about this album that "music and women look better with little clothes."<ref name=unionradio1>[http://www.unionradio.net/ActualidadUR/Nota/visorNota.aspx?id=52024&tpCont=1 "Arjona desnuda sus canciones en "Poquita ropa"] (in Spanish).

Retrieved on 23 March 2012.</ref> He further commented that "they [the songs] are like women, they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them."<ref name=unionradio1/> 

Production was handled by Arjona himself and Dan Warner, who has worked with [[Shakira]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].<ref name=puente1>[http://www.nacion.com/2010-08-09/Entretenimiento/NotaPrincipal/v09-GERAR-MUSICA1.aspx "Ricardo Arjona tiende hoy su Puente"].

"[[Puente (song)|Puente]]", the [[lead single]], has a length of eight minutes and thirty seconds and is divided in three parts. The first one is a cappella song, sang mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with [[Caribbean music|caribbean]] and [[Latin music|Latin sounds]], with some [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[Cuban music|Cuban-influences]].<ref>[http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetoluca/notas/n1739751.htm "Le canta al pueblo cubano"] (in Spanish).

When asked about "Puente"'s main theme, Arjona commented: "Although many believe is a treshed topic, it isn't for a cuban, be it on the island or Florida. The status of this dispute hasn't changed since 1959 and i've never seen something as disgusting as a rivality between people occasionated from politics.

"[[Vida (song)|Vida]]", the second single, is considered by Arjona as an autobiographical song.
