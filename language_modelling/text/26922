'''YouTube''' is a [[Video hosting service|video sharing]] [[website]] on which users can upload and share [[video]]s. Three former [[PayPal]] employees created YouTube in February 2005.<ref>{{cite web | title=Surprise!

The company is based in [[San Bruno, California]], and uses [[Flash Video|Adobe Flash Video]] technology to display a wide variety of [[user-generated content|user-generated video content]], including [[film|movie]] clips, [[television program|TV]] clips, and [[music videos]], as well as amateur content such as [[video blogging]] and short original videos. Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, although media corporations including [[CBS]], the [[BBC]], [[Universal Music Group|UMG]] and other organizations offer some of their material via the site, as part of the YouTube partnership program.<ref>{{cite web | title=BBC strikes Google-YouTube deal|author=Weber, Tim| publisher = [[BBC]]| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6411017.stm|accessdate= 2009-01-17 }}</ref>

Unregistered users can watch the videos, while registered users are permitted to upload an unlimited number of videos. Videos that are considered to contain potentially offensive content are available only to registered users over the age of 18. The uploading of videos containing [[defamation]], [[pornography]], [[copyright violation]]s, and material encouraging criminal conduct is prohibited by YouTube's [[terms of service]].

{{main|History of YouTube}}
[[File:901cherryave.jpg|thumb|right|YouTube's current headquarters in [[San Bruno, California]].]]
YouTube was founded by [[Chad Hurley]], [[Steve Chen (YouTube)|Steve Chen]] and [[Jawed Karim]], who were all early employees of [[PayPal]].<ref name="usatoday">{{cite web | url = http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-11-21-video-websites_x.htm | title = Video websites pop up, invite postings | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2005-11-21 | accessdate = 2006-07-28 | last = Graham | first = Jefferson}}</ref> Hurley studied design at [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], while Chen and Karim studied [[computer science]] together at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube: Sharing Digital Camera Videos |publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]| url =http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/news/articles.php?id=2006Feb3-126|accessdate= 2008-11-29 }}</ref>

According to a story that has often been repeated in the media, Chad Hurley and Steve Chen developed the idea for YouTube during the early months of 2005, after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at Chen's apartment in [[San Francisco]]. Jawed Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, and Chad Hurley commented that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party "was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible."<ref>{{cite web | title=The Gurus of YouTube|author=Cloud, John| publisher = [[Time Magazine]]| url =http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1570721,00.html|accessdate= 2008-11-29 }}</ref>

YouTube began as a venture-funded technology startup, primarily from a US$11.5 million investment by [[Sequoia Capital]] between November 2005 and April 2006.<ref>{{cite web | title=Venture Firm Shares a YouTube Jackpot|author=Miguel Helft and Matt Richtel| publisher = [[The New York Times]] |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/technology/10payday.html|accessdate= 2008-11-30 }}</ref> YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a [[pizza|pizzeria]] and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese restaurant]] in [[San Mateo, California]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Ready for Its Close-Up|author=Sara Kehaulani Goo| publisher = [[Washington Post]]| url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600660.html|accessdate= 2008-11-29 }}</ref> The [[domain name]] <code>www.youtube.com</code> was activated on February 15, 2005, and the website was developed over the subsequent months.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://whois.domaintools.com/youtube.com| title = Whois Record for <code>www.youtube.com</code> | accessdate = 2009-04-01 | work = | publisher =DomainTools |}}</ref> The first YouTube video was entitled ''Me at the zoo'', and shows founder Jawed Karim at [[San Diego Zoo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=YouTube: Overnight success has sparked a backlash|author=Alleyne, Richard| publisher = [[Daily Telegraph]]| url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2480280/YouTube-Overnight-success-has-sparked-a-backlash.html|accessdate= 2009-01-17 }}</ref> The video was uploaded on April 23, 2005, and can still be viewed on the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw|title=Me at the zoo|publisher=YouTube|date=2005-04-23|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>

YouTube offered the public a [[beta test]] of the site in May 2005, six months before the official launch in November 2005. The site grew rapidly, and in July 2006 the company announced that more than 65,000 new videos were being uploaded every day, and that the site was receiving 100 million video views per day.<ref>{{cite news |title=YouTube serves up 100 million videos a day online |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-07-16-youtube-views_x.htm |work= |publisher= [[USA Today]]|date=2006-07-16 |accessdate=2008-11-29}}</ref> According to data published by [[market research]] company [[comScore]], YouTube is the dominant provider of online video in the [[United States]], with a [[market share]] of around 43 percent and more than six billion videos viewed in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web | title=YouTube Surpasses 100 Million U.S. Viewers for the First Time|author=| publisher =[[comScore]]| url =http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=2741|accessdate= 2009-03-05 }}</ref> It is estimated that 20 hours of new videos are uploaded to the site every minute, and that around three quarters of the material comes from outside the United States.<ref>{{cite web | title=Zoinks! 20 Hours of Video Uploaded Every Minute!|author=Junee, Ryan|date = 2009-05-20| publisher =YouTube |url = http://www.youtube.com/blog?entry=on4EmafA5MA|accessdate= 2009-05-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Eric Schmidt, Princeton Colloquium on Public & Int'l Affairs|author=| publisher = YouTube| url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nXmDxf7D_g#t=14m52s|accessdate= 2009-06-01 }}</ref> It is also estimated that in 2007 YouTube consumed as much [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] as the entire [[Internet]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web | title = Web could collapse as video demand soars|author=| publisher = [[Daily Telegraph]]| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/07/nweb107.xml|accessdate= 2008-04-21 }}</ref> In March 2008, YouTube's bandwidth costs were estimated at approximately US$1 million a day.<ref name=Moneyclip>{{cite news|first=Yi-Wyn|last=Yen|date=2008-03-25|url=http://techland.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/03/25/youtube-looks-for-the-money-clip|title=YouTube Looks For the Money Clip|accessdate=2008-03-26}}</ref> [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] ranks YouTube as the third most visited website on the Internet, behind [[Yahoo!]] and [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Alexa Traffic Rank for YouTube (three month average)|author=| publisher = [[Alexa Internet]]| url =http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/youtube.com|accessdate= 2009-08-07}}</ref>

The choice of the domain name <code>www.youtube.com</code> led to problems for a similarly named website, <code>www.utube.com</code>. The owner of the site, [[Universal Tube & Rollform Equipment]], filed a lawsuit against YouTube in November 2006 after being overloaded on a regular basis by people looking for YouTube. Universal Tube has since changed the name of its website to <code>www.utubeonline.com</code>.<ref>{{cite web | title = Help!

In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with [[MGM]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] and [[CBS]] which will allow the companies to post full-length films and television shows on the site, accompanied by advertisements.

==Social impact==
{{main|Social impact of YouTube}}
[[Image:Guitar youtube.png|right|thumb|[[Jeong-Hyun Lim]] performs [[Pachelbel's Canon]] in one of YouTube's most viewed videos.]]

Before the launch of YouTube in 2005, there were few simple methods available for ordinary computer users who wanted to post videos online. With its easy to use interface, YouTube made it possible for anyone with an Internet connection to post a video that millions of people could watch within a few minutes. The wide range of topics covered by YouTube has turned video sharing into one of the most important parts of [[Cyberculture|Internet culture]].

An early example of the social impact of YouTube was the success of the [[Bus Uncle]] video in 2006. It shows a heated conversation between a youth and an older man on a bus in Hong Kong, and was discussed widely in the mainstream media.<ref>{{cite web | title = Irate HK man unlikely Web hero|author=Bray, Marianne| publisher = [[CNN]]| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/06/07/hk.uncle/|accessdate = 2008-05-28 }}</ref> Another YouTube video to receive extensive coverage is ''guitar'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjA5faZF1A8|title=guitar|date=2005-12-20|accessdate=2009-08-03|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> which features a performance of [[Pachelbel's Canon]] on an [[electric guitar]]. The name of the performer is not given in the video, and after it received millions of views ''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed the identity of the guitarist as [[Jeong-Hyun Lim]], a 23-year-old from South Korea who had recorded the track in his bedroom.<ref name="nyt-heff">{{cite news|last = Heffernand|first=Virginia|title= Web Guitar Wizard Revealed at Last

YouTube was awarded a 2008 [[George Foster Peabody Award]] and cited for being "a 'Speakers' Corner' that both embodies and promotes democracy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/event.php?id=59|title=Complete List of 2008 Peabody Award Winners|date=2009-04-01|publisher=Peabody Awards, University of Georgia|accessdate=2009-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/printedition/2009/04/02/peabody0402.html|title=Peabody honors CNN, TMC|last=Ho|first=Rodney|date=20009-04-02|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|accessdate=2009-04-14}}</ref>

==Criticism==
{{main|Criticism of YouTube}}
===Copyrighted material===
YouTube has been criticized for failing to ensure that its videos respect the law of [[copyright]]. At the time of uploading a video, YouTube users are always shown a screen with the following message:
<blockquote>Do not upload any TV shows, music videos, music concerts or commercials without permission unless they consist entirely of content you created yourself. The Copyright Tips page and the Community Guidelines can help you determine whether your video infringes someone else's copyright.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/955/li1.htm|title=Stardom and youtubism|work=Al-Ahram|first=Salonaz|last=Sami|date=2009-07-09|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref></blockquote>
Despite this advice, there are still many unauthorized clips from television shows, films and music videos on YouTube. YouTube does not view videos before they are posted online, and it is left to copyright holders to issue a takedown notice under the terms of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Organizations including [[Viacom]] and the English [[Premier League]] have filed lawsuits against YouTube, claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted material.<ref>{{cite web | title = Viacom will sue YouTube for $1bn|author=| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6446193.stm|accessdate= 2008-05-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Premier League to take action against YouTube |author=| publisher = [[Daily Telegraph]]| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2007/05/05/ufnrup05.xml|accessdate= 2008-05-24 }}</ref> Viacom, demanding US$1 billion in [[damages]], said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed "an astounding 1.5 billion times". YouTube responded by stating that it "goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works". Since Viacom filed its lawsuit, YouTube has introduced a system called Video ID, which checks uploaded videos against a database of copyrighted content with the aim of reducing violations.<ref>{{cite web | title = YouTube law fight 'threatens net' |author=| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7420955.stm|accessdate= 2008-05-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = What is YouTube's Video Identification tool?|author=| publisher = YouTube| url = http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=83766&hl=en-uk|accessdate= 2008-05-27 }}</ref>

In August 2008, a U.S. court ruled that copyright holders cannot order the removal of an online file without first determining whether the posting reflected [[fair use]] of the material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who had made a [[home video]] of her 13-month-old son dancing to [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "[[Let's Go Crazy]]" and posted the 29-second video on YouTube.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/20/MNU412FKRL.DTL |quote= |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2008-08-25 }}</ref>

===Privacy===
In July 2008, [[Viacom]] won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the site. The move led to concerns that the viewing habits of individual users could be identified through a combination of their [[IP address]]es and login names. The decision was criticized by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], which called the court ruling "a set-back to privacy rights".<ref>{{cite web | title = Google must divulge YouTube log|author=| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7488009.stm|accessdate= 2008-07-03 }}</ref> U.S. District Court Judge [[Louis Stanton]] dismissed the privacy concerns as "speculative", and ordered YouTube to hand over documents totalling around 12&nbsp;[[terabyte]]s of data. Judge Stanton rejected Viacom's request for YouTube to hand over the [[source code]] of its [[search engine (computing)|search engine]] system, saying that there was no evidence that YouTube treated videos infringing copyright differently.<ref>{{cite web | title = YouTube ordered to reveal its viewers|author=| publisher = [[CNN]]| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/TECH/biztech/07/03/youtubelawsuit.ap/index.html|accessdate= 2008-07-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Google Told to Turn Over User Data of YouTube|author=Helft, Miguel| publisher = [[The New York Times]]| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/04/technology/04youtube.html?bl&ex=1215230400&en=2144c0053de49341&ei=5087%0A|accessdate= 2008-07-04 }}</ref>

===Inappropriate content===
YouTube has also faced criticism over the offensive content in some of its videos. Although YouTube's [[terms of service]] forbid the uploading of material likely to be considered inappropriate, YouTube does not check every video before it goes online. Controversial areas for videos have included [[Holocaust denial]] and the [[Hillsborough Disaster]], in which 96 football fans from [[Liverpool]] were crushed to death in 1989, conspiracy theories and religion.<ref>{{cite web | title =YouTube criticized in Germany over anti-Semitic Nazi videos|author=| publisher = [[Reuters]]| url = http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/898004.html|accessdate= 2008-05-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =Fury as YouTube carries sick Hillsboro video insult|author=| publisher = icLiverpool| url = http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0100regionalnews/tm_headline=fury-as-youtube-carries-sick-hillsboro-video-insult%26method=full%26objectid=18729523%26page=1%26siteid=50061-name_page.html|accessdate= 2008-05-24 }}</ref>

YouTube relies on its users to flag the content of videos as inappropriate, and a YouTube employee will view a flagged video to determine whether it violates the site's [[terms of service]].<ref name="guidelines" /> In July 2008 the Culture and Media Committee of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] stated that it was "unimpressed" with YouTube's system for policing its videos, and argued that "Proactive review of content should be standard practice for sites hosting [[user generated content]]." YouTube responded by stating: "We have strict rules on what's allowed, and a system that enables anyone who sees inappropriate content to report it to our 24/7 review team and have it dealt with promptly. We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our users. Given the volume of content uploaded on our site, we think this is by far the most effective way to make sure that the tiny minority of videos that break the rules come down quickly."<ref>{{cite web | title =YouTube attacked by MPs over sex and violence footage|author=| publisher = [[Daily Telegraph]]| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/07/31/dlyoutube131.xml|accessdate= 2008-08-21 }}</ref>

This allows the site to display videos with quality comparable to more established video playback technologies (such as [[Windows Media Player]], [[QuickTime]], and [[RealPlayer]]) that generally require the user to download and install a [[web browser]] [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] to view video content.<ref>{{cite web | title =Did YouTube Cut the Gordian Knot of Video Codecs?|author=Atwood, Jeff| publisher = Coding Horror|url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000755.html|accessdate= 2008-12-04 }}</ref> Viewing Flash video also requires a plug-in, but [[market research]] from [[Adobe Systems]] has found that its Flash plug-in is installed on over 95% of personal computers.<ref>{{cite web | title =Adobe Flash Player Version Penetration|author=| publisher = [[Adobe Systems]]| url=http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html|accessdate= 2008-12-04 }}</ref>

Videos uploaded to YouTube are limited to ten minutes in length and a file size of 2&nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]].<ref name="10min">{{cite news|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/youtube-10-minute-limit-deters-copyrighted-video-uploads/3200/|title=YouTube 10 Minute Limit Deters Copyrighted Video Uploads|date=2006-03-31|first=Loren|last=Baker|publisher=Search Engine Journal|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title =YouTube doubles video file size to 2G|author=| publisher = AFP| url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j7PQ2PETQQW2NgOkKsCWcE3gAZqQ|accessdate= 2009-07-03 }}</ref> When YouTube was launched in 2005, it was possible for any user to upload videos longer than ten minutes, but YouTube's help section now states: "You can no longer upload videos longer than ten minutes regardless of what type of account you have. Users who had previously been allowed to upload longer content still retain this ability, so you may occasionally see videos that are longer than ten minutes."<ref name="longer">{{cite web | title =Account Types: Longer videos|author=| publisher = YouTube| url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=71673&ctx=sibling|accessdate= 2008-12-04 }}</ref> The ten minute limit was introduced in March 2006, after YouTube found that the majority of videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films.<ref name="10min"/><ref name="longer"/><ref>{{cite web | title =YouTube caps video lengths to reduce infringement|author=Fisher, Ken| publisher = [[Ars Technica]]| url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060329-6481.html|accessdate= 2008-12-04 }}</ref>

YouTube accepts videos uploaded in most formats, including [[Windows Media Video|.WMV]], [[Audio Video Interleave|.AVI]], [[Matroska|.MKV]], [[QuickTime|.MOV]], [[Moving Picture Experts Group|MPEG]], [[MPEG-4 Part 14|.MP4]], [[DivX]], [[Flash Video|.FLV]], and [[Ogg Theora|.OGG]]. It also supports [[3GP]], allowing videos to be uploaded directly from a [[mobile phone]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Video Formats: File formats|author=| publisher = YouTube| url=http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=55744&topic=10526|accessdate= 2008-12-04 }}</ref>

===Video quality===
YouTube originally offered videos in only one format, but it now has three main formats, as well as a "mobile" format, for viewing on [[mobile phones]]. The original format, now labeled "standard quality", displays videos at a resolution of 320x240 [[pixel]]s using the [[Sorenson Spark]] codec, with [[monaural|mono]] [[MP3]] audio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sorensonmedia.com/news/?n=379|title=Market Deamnd for Sorenson Media's Sorenson Spark Video Decoder Expands Sharply|publisher=Sorenson Media|date=2009-06-02|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> This was, at the time, the standard for streaming online videos.

"High quality" videos, introduced in March 2008, are shown at up to 864x480 pixels with stereo [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.youtube.com/blog?entry=W6MpIqdrtIE|title=YouTube Blog - YouTube Videos in High Quality|date=2008-03-24|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> This format offers a significant improvement over standard quality. In November 2008 [[720p]] [[high-definition video|HD]] support was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.youtube.com/blog?entry=80oHX7A6Krw|title=Bigger Isn't Always Better... But in This Case, We Believe It Is|work=YouTube Blog|date=2008-11-25|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2009-04-04}}</ref> At the same time, the YouTube player was changed from a [[4:3]] [[aspect ratio]] to a [[widescreen]] [[16:9]]. 720p videos are shown at 1280x720 pixels resolution and encoded with the [[H.264]] video codec. They also feature stereo audio encoded with AAC.

=== 3D videos and viewing ===
In a video posted on July 21st, 2009<ref>{{cite web|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ANcspdYh_U|title=YouTube in 3D|publisher=YouTube|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref>, YouTube software engineer Peter Bradshaw announced that YouTube users can now upload [[3-D_film|3D videos]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/news167575864.html|title=YouTube in 3D?|work=Physorg|date=2009-07-23|accessdate=2009-08-03|first=Miranda|last=Marquit}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://techie-buzz.com/video-tools/youtube-3d-videos.html|title=YouTube 3D Videos|date=2009-07-20|work=Techie Buzz|first=Keith|last=Dsouza|accessdate=2009-08-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thinkdigit.com/Internet/YouTube-adds-a-dimension-3D-goggles-not_3219.html|title=YouTube adds a dimension, 3D goggles not included|date=2009-07-21|accessdate=2009-08-03|work=thinkdigit|first=Kshitij|last=Sobti}}</ref> After each 3D video is uploaded and processed, users have several choices on how to view the video. For users without 3D glasses they have the option to watch the video Cross-Eyed, Parallel, Mirror-Split and Left and Right Image Only. Users who have 3D glasses simply have to chose what color pairing they have on their glasses in order to view the video in 3D. Neither GeForce 3D Vision nor [[polarized 3D]] viewing are currently supported.

==Content accessibility==
One of the key features of YouTube is the ability of users to view its videos on web pages outside the site. Each YouTube video is accompanied by a piece of [[HTML]], which can be used to embed it on a page outside the YouTube website. This functionality is often used to embed YouTube videos in [[social networking]] pages and [[blog]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtube.com/sharing|title=Sharing YouTube Videos|author=YouTube|date=|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> Some [[mobile phone]]s are capable of accessing YouTube videos, dependent on the provider and the data plan. YouTube Mobile was launched in June 2007, and uses [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] streaming for the video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.youtube.com/|title=YouTube Mobile}}</ref> Not all of YouTube's videos are available on the mobile version of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/06/mobile-youtube.html|title=Mobile YouTube|author=Google Operating System|date=2007-06-15|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref>

Since June 2007, YouTube's videos have been available for viewing on a range of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products. This required YouTube's content to be transcoded into Apple's preferred video standard, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], a process that took several months. YouTube videos can be viewed on devices including [[Apple TV]] and the [[iPhone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/20youtube.html|title=YouTube Live on Apple TV Today; Coming to iPhone on June 29|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=2007-06-20|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> A [[TiVo]] service update in July 2008 allowed the system to search and play YouTube videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gizmodo.com/5026092/tivo-getting-youtube-streaming-today|title=TiVo Getting YouTube Streaming TODAY|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=2007-07-17|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> In January 2009, YouTube launched "YouTube for TV", a version of the website tailored for set-top boxes and other TV-based media devices with web browsers, initially allowing its videos to be viewed on the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Wii]] [[video game console]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/01/youtube-wii-ps3.html|title=YouTube video comes to Wii and PlayStation 3 game consoles|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-01-15|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Coming Up Next...

YouTube does not usually offer a download link for its videos, and intends that they are viewed through its website interface.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/t/terms|title=Terms of Use, 6.1|publisher=YouTube|date=|accessdate=2009-02-20}}</ref> A small number of videos, such as the weekly addresses by President [[Barack Obama]], can be downloaded as [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] files.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10144823-2.html|title=(Some) YouTube videos get download option|author=[[CNET]]|date=2009-01-16|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref> Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] allow users to download YouTube videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/---mark-milian.html?cid=149000259|title=YouTube looks out for content owners, disables video ripping|author=Milian, Mark|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2009-02-19|accessdate=2009-02-21}}</ref> In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free or for a fee paid through [[Google Checkout]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/12/AR2009021203239.html|title=YouTube Hopes To Boost Revenue With Video Downloads|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=2009-02-12|accessdate=2009-02-19}}</ref>

==Localization==
On June 19, 2007, [[Google]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Eric E. Schmidt]] was in [[Paris]] to launch the new [[Internationalization and localization|localization]] system.<ref name="local"/> The entire interface of the website is now available with localized versions in 22 countries:

The YouTube interface suggests which local version should be chosen based on the [[IP address]] of the user. In some cases, the message "This video is not available in your country" may appear due to copyright restrictions or inappropriate content.<ref>{{cite web| title = Learn More: Video not available in my country|author=|publisher = YouTube Help| url = http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en-uk&answer=92571|date=|accessdate= 2009-08-04}}</ref>

Plans for YouTube to create a local version in [[Turkey]] have run into problems, since the Turkish authorities asked YouTube to set up an office in Turkey, which would be subject to Turkish law. YouTube says that it has no intention of doing this, and that its videos are not subject to Turkish law. Turkish authorities have expressed concerns that YouTube has been used to post videos insulting to [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] and some material offensive to [[Muslim]]s.<ref>{{cite news| title = Long-standing YouTube ban lifted only for several hours|author=| publisher = Today's Zaman| url = http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=145219&bolum=101|date=2008-06-19|accessdate= 2008-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title =Turks censor YouTube censorship|author=Danforth, Nick| publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle]]| url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/30/ED68191LKM.DTL|date=2009-07-31|accessdate= 2009-08-04}}</ref>

In March 2009, a dispute between YouTube and the [[PRS for Music|Performing Rights Society]] led to premium music videos being blocked for YouTube users in the [[United Kingdom]]. The removal of videos posted by the major record companies occurred after failure to reach agreement on a licensing deal. The [[Music Publishers' Association]] described the decision as "particularly disappointing".<ref>{{cite news| title = Google and PRA accused of 'posturing' over YouTube music by Stephen Carter|author=Khan, Urmee|publisher = [[Daily Telegraph]]| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/google/4968182/Google-and-PRA-accused-of-posturing-over-YouTube-music-by-Stephen-Carter.html|date=2009-03-10|accessdate= 2009-03-10}}</ref> In April 2009, a similar dispute led to the removal of premium music videos for users in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Now YouTube stops the music in Germany|author=|publisher = [[The Guardian]]| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2009/apr/01/youtube-digital-music-and-audio|date=2009-04-01|accessdate= 2009-04-02}}</ref>
