The '''Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge''' is a railroad drawbridge ([[movable bridge]]) over the [[Pequonnock River]] in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Owned by the State of Connecticut and maintained and operated by [[Metro-North Railroad]], it is also referred to as Pequonnock River Bridge, PECK Bridge, and Undergrade Bridge 55.90 (the mileage from [[Grand Central Terminal]]). Currently the bridge is part of the [[Northeast Corridor]] line, carrying rail traffic of [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North, as well as freight trains operated by the [[Providence & Worcester Railroad]].

==History==
The previous bridge was constructed in 1902 by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] (replacing an earlier bridge) as one of two through girder Scherzer rolling [[bascule bridge]]s on the New Haven Line. The bridge consisted of twin parallel rolling lift spans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/87000843.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination: Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge / Pequonnock River Bridge |author=Ann Baggerman |format=pdf |pages= |date=August 10, 1977 |accessdate=2010-07-28 |quote= |publisher=National Park Service }} and [http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Photos/87000843.pdf accompanying photograph].</ref>

It was one of eight legacy moveable bridges on the Amtrak route through Connecticut surveyed in one multiple property study in 1986.<ref name="nrhpmps">{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/64000097.pdf |title=Movable Railroad Bridges on the NE Corridor in Connecticut TR |date=February 4, 1986 |author=Bruce Clouette, Matthew Roth and John Herzan |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>  The eight bridges from west to east were:  [[Mianus River Railroad Bridge]] at Cos Cob, built in 1904 (the surviving twin of the Pequonnock Bridge); [[Norwalk River Railroad Bridge]] at Norwalk, 1896; [[Saugatuck River Railroad Bridge]] at Westport, 1905; the Pequonnock Bridge; [[Housatonic River Railroad Bridge]], at Devon, 1905; [[Connecticut River Railroad Bridge]], Old Saybrook-Old Lyme, 1907; [[Niantic River Bridge]], East Lyme-Waterford, 1907; and [[Thames River Bridge (Amtrak)|Thames River Bridge]], Groton, built in 1919. The old bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1987, an honor not enjoyed for long, as it was obvious even before the survey that total replacement, rather than repair, was needed for the span. 

By the 1980s, the 1902 bridge had seriously deteriorated due to corrosion and metal fatigue. Compounding this was downstream movement of the main (pit) pier which supported the machinery and the waterproof chamber housing the descending component of the rolling lift spans; all of these issues forced a 10 mph restriction on all trains and closed the bridge to marine traffic. A new structure was designed with the same alignment utilized, but with improved [[Track transition curve|track spirals]] to allow higher train speeds, and a bascule component which allowed a higher clearance and a wider channel for shipping. <ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=David W.|title=Replacement of the Pequonnock River Railroad Bridge (PECK) and Bridgeport Viaduct in Bridgeport, Connecticut|url=http://www.heavymovablestructures.org/assets/technical_papers/00320.pdf|work=3rd Biennial Symposium of the Heavy Movable Structures Movable Bridges Affiliate of the American Consulting Engineers Council, St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, November 12-15, 1990|publisher=Heavy Movable Structures, Inc.|accessdate=30 November 2011}}</ref> In 1992, $80 million in federal funds were put aside to help replace the Pequonnock River railroad bridge by Rep. [[Christopher Shays]], R-4th District and Rep. [[Rosa L. DeLauro]], D-3rd District.<ref>http://articles.courant.com/1992-10-06/news/0000111630_1_congressional-budget-office-election-year-members-projects</ref>.

Construction work, which had begun as early as 1989, commenced at full speed by the mid-1990s with trains being diverted to a fixed [[shoofly]] bridge, and electrical utilities ([[United Illuminating]] as well as Metro-North) relocated to temporary structures. All work was completed in 1998. As on the old bridge, the movable span is twin parallel spans, capable of independent as well as tandem operation.
