'''Latymer Upper School''', founded in 1624 by [[Edward Latymer]], is a selective [[Independent School (UK)|independent school]] in [[Hammersmith]], west [[London]], lying between King Street and the [[Thames]]. It is a day school for 1,130 pupils - boys and girls aged 11-18 (there is also the Latymer Prep School for boys and girls between 7-11). The Sixth Form of 340 is one of the largest in London and offers 35 academic courses as well as a range of extra curricular activities.

According to the league tables published by the BBC, at [[GCSE]] it ranked as the middle achiever of the three selective schools in its area [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/05/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/205_gcse_lea.stm], and bottom of those three schools both in terms of value added to its pupils' results [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/05/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/205_va_lea.stm] and in terms of [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] exams [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/05/school_tables/secondary_schools/html/205_alevel_lea.stm].   It should be noted that the other two schools are not directly comparable as they are girls-only schools.

Pupils come from a wide area of [[London]]. However, like many independent schools, it reflects the local community only partially {{Fact|date=March 2007}}. After the Labour Government's abolition of the [[Assisted Places Scheme]] for the children of poorer families, the social range has narrowed and the relatively small number of bursary places that are subsidised by the School is not able to compensate for this.<ref>[http://www.adamsmith.org/pdf/lambert-3-02.pdf Access to Education], [[Adam Smith Institute]] essay by Chris Walken, 2002</ref> In particular, Hammersmith's substantial Polish and Afro-Caribbean communities are significantly under-represented.<ref>[http://www.isinspect.org.uk/reports/2001/0626_01.htm Inspection Report, 2001]</ref><ref>[http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Council_and_Democracy/Statistics_and_Census_Information/Census_information/20261_2001_Census_Part2.asp 2001 Census; Report 2: Ethnic Groups in Hammersmith & Fulham]</ref> The Sixth Form has been mixed sex since [[1996]], and the main school became fully co-educational, with the introduction of girls into Year 7 for the first time in [[2004]]. 

The PE department offer extracurricular programmes. Optional sports include rugby, cricket, rowing, athletics, soccer, tennis, cross-country, fencing, karate, scuba diving, table tennis, squash, badminton and swimming. 300 students are currently learning to play a musical instrument, with 175 involved in the school's 2 full orchestras and 5 string orchestras and around 150 in the choirs.

Student societies in the school are active and cover a range of interests. The [[J. S. Mill]], Literary and Latymer Societies have recently played host to a series of distinguished guest speakers, including Professor [[Jon Stallworthy]] of [[Oxford University]], Dr. [[Madsen Pirie]], President of the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and the actor/director [[Alan Rickman]], a former pupil. In all, there are over 40 clubs and societies at Latymer, including [[Bridge (game)|bridge]], [[chess]], [[debating]], philosophy and photography. Drama is also quoted as particularly strong, with several productions each year.

The school has links with other schools across Europe with a joint orchestra, as well as other trips (such as work experience), with [[Godolphin and Latymer School]]. There are organized trips abroad throughout the year, such as skiing trips, language exhanges, work experience in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]] and [[Stockholm]], [[Classics]] trips to Italy and Greece, sports tours, expeditions to Peru (2002) and Tibet (2004). Latymer Upper is also a strong participant in the [[Duke of Edinburgh Award]] scheme.

The school is active in [[Charitable organization|charity]] work: the annual "Charities' Week" raised <U+00A3>3,000 in [[2006]]. The school branch of [[Amnesty International]] is involved in numerous fund- and awareness-raising campaigns. A student-led [[environmentalist]] group has ensured that each classroom is equipped with a recycling bin, and is currently working towards providing a solar panel to power an upcoming building project.

Latymer Upper works closely with the local community, and in particular with the Education Department of the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, as well as other bodies. Latymer contributes to local music, art, drama, dance and sports projects, as well as acting as venue for a Saturday School and [[Scuba diving]] for the disabled. Some sixth Form students are encouraged to help in local primary schools and old people's homes as part of their general studies program, as well as with groups helping the homeless and disabled.

==Facilities==

The school's sporting facilities on site include a boathouse with direct access to the [[Thames]], a sports hall and an indoor swimming pool. The school also maintains playing fields about a mile and a half away, on [[Wood Lane]], with a sports pavilion and changing rooms.

150 computers are provided for pupil use, networked and with e-mail and internet access, and [[ICT (education)|ICT]] is taught in one lesson a week in Years 7 to 9.

The <U+00A3>4 million Latymer Arts Centre opened in January [[2000]] with a 300-seat theatre, music study rooms, art galleries and studios and a cafe and atrium area.

Pupils are permitted to cycle to school, with storage space provided for their bikes. Meals are self-service in the lunch hall, and there is a caf<U+00E9> in the "atrium".

The library / old music building was recently demolished and a new one is currently being built, funded by an anonymous <U+00A3>3million donation. <ref>New Music Building[http://www.latymer-upper.org/music-build-project-1.html]</ref>.

==History and traditions==
In [[1624]], a wealthy [[puritan]], [[Edward Latymer]], pledged on his death-bed to educate and feed "eight poore boies" of [[Hammersmith]]. For the next twenty years, local boys were educated in a school erected in [[Fulham]]'s churchyard, moving in 1648 to another school built in Hammersmith. Later, in 1657, a parochial charity school was set up, which served as the Latymer legacy for the following century until it was rebuilt in 1755. A new facility was built on what is now King Street in Hammersmith in 1863, and was replaced in 1890 with a new building between King Street and the [[Thames]]. This structure persists to the present day as the core of the Upper School.  

The school now charges fees amounting to <U+00A3>12,465 a year per student.<ref>School Fees Information[http://www.latymer-upper.org/admissions.html]</ref>

Each year, the school gathers in the nearby St. Paul's Church for "Founder's Day", an annual reflection upon and celebration of Edward Latymer and other beneficiaries of the school.

Latymer featured in the national press in April 2007 when it was revealed that four pupils had been expelled after being caught distributing [[MDMA|ecstasy]] at the school's Sixth Form [[prom]] at the [[Bond Street]] nightclub, L'Equipe Anglaise.<ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=18971920%26siteid=89520-name_page.html The Mirror, 27th April 2007]</ref>

==Coat of arms==
[[Image:Oldcoatofarms.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original coat of arms]]
The school for many years used the armorial bearings of the founder, Edward Latymer.  This included his motto, ''paulatim ergo certe'' ("Slowly therefore surely"), which doubled as a pun, including the word "latimer" (spelt thus due to there being no letter ''[[y]]'' in [[Latin]]). An intermediate coat of arms was taken from one of the quarters of the original coat of arms which combined that of the Latymer Foundation and of the Latymer School.  The motto was dropped recently, along with the coat of arms, and a new, much simpler shield (described in the school literature as a "new crest") was adopted.<ref>[http://www.latymer-upper.org/download.php?file=TWpRPQ Old Latymerian News, October 2004] ([[PDF]] document). Accessed December 15th, 2006.</ref>  No approval was obtained from the College of Arms for this new coat of arms, and it is, therefore, unauthorised by the [[Law of Arms]]. <ref>[http://www.latymer-upper.org/download.php?file=TWpRPQ Old Latymerian News, October 2004] ([[PDF]] document). Accessed December 15th, 2006.</ref>

The original arms continue to be used, with a different motto, by the sister foundation, [[The Latymer School]].
