'''Ferrocarril Central Andino''' (FCCA) is the consortium which operates a railway in [[Peru]] linking the Pacific port of [[Callao]] and the capital [[Lima]] with [[Huancayo]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]]. It is the second highest railway in the world (after [[Qingzang railway|the line to Tibet]]), with La Cima station at 4818 meters (15,807 feet) above sea level. 

In July 1999 the government awarded a consortium led by [[Railroad Development Corporation#Peru|Railroad Development Corporation (RDC)]] of Pittsburgh, USA, a concession to operate the former Ferrocarril del Centro for 30 years. Investors in Ferrocarril Central Andino include RDC, Juan Olaechea & Company, Minas Buenaventura, ADR Inversiones, and Inversiones Andino.<ref>{{cite web | title=RDC operating entities | url=http://www.rrdc.com/op_peru_fcca.html | publisher=''[[Railroad Development Corp]]'' | accessdate 2007-09-08}}</ref>

== Route ==
The line starts at [[Callao]] port city and goes through [[Lima]] parallel to the [[R<U+00ED>mac River]]. It crosses into [[Jun<U+00ED>n]] state via the Galera Tunnel, the highest railroad tunnel in the world. It reaches [[La Oroya]], where it splits in two: the southern branch goes to [[Huancayo]], while the northern branch goes into [[Pasco Region|Pasco]] state, through [[Cerro de Pasco]] (the state capital) to the Goyllarisquizga coal mines. Formerly a branch split off at Cerro de Pasco and ran into [[Pachitea Province]] in [[Hu<U+00E1>nuco region|Hu<U+00E1>nuco]] state.

In June 2006, the Peruvian government agreed that FCCA should go ahead with converting the {{RailGauge|914}} gauge [[Huancayo]] - [[Huancavelica]] line to {{RailGauge|1435}} gauge.  Estimated to take 16 months, the US$33m project will be funded jointly by the government and the [[Andean Development Corporation]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Huancavelica upgrade | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | accessdate = 2007-09-08 | date=2006-06-01 | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2006/06/3802/huancavelica_upgrade.html}}</ref> <ref>[http://www.trainsunlimitedtours.com/great-south-american-rail-adventure.html Great South American Rail Adventure<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

RDC has suggested the building of a 21 km, US$400m tunnel in the [[Andes]], to reduce the spectacular 332 km Lima - Huancayo journey to 4 hours.<ref> RailwaysAfrica [[15 June]] [[2006]]</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:Peru railroad steel bridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Steel bridge near Matucana]]
In 1851, engineer [[Ernest Malinowski]] proposed to extend the Lima-to-Callao railroad as far as the valley of [[Jauja]]. Malinowski, a Polish ex-pat, was voluntarily exiled in Peru by political questions in his country, occupied at that time by Germany, Russia and Austria.

The government commissioned Felipe Barreda, Mariano Felipe Peace Sold<U+00E1>nm, and Brown Manuel to report in detail on the project.  This commission devised a detailed plan for the railroad which, after approval by the Peruvian Congress, was integrated with the Malinowski proposal.

The Peruvian Congress named a new commission to make recommendations on alternate construction plans.  This second commission delivered a meticulous report of the four possible routes that it had explored and evaluated:
* By the gorge of the R<U+00ED>mac River, starting in Lima and proceeding through Matucana, San Mateo and Tarma.
* By the gorge of the Chill<U+00F3>n River, from Lima, through Horseman, Yangas, Obrajillo, Casachanca and Carhuacancha
* Along the Chancay River, from Lima, through Chancay, Macas, Huamantanga, Huaillay and Cerro de Pasco
* Along the Lur<U+00ED>n River, from Lima, through Lur<U+00ED>n, Sisicaya, Tupicocha, San Dami<U+00E1>n, Tuctucocha, Pumacocha, Basket, Tarma and Jauja.

According to the report, construction of the proposed line was possible but difficult by R<U+00ED>mac gorge, almost impossible by Chill<U+00F3>n gorge, impossible by the Chancay, but very easy by the Lur<U+00ED>n. This last option was the choice of engineer Gerrit Backus, reputed to be one of the most able professionals in the design and construction of railway routes.  This third phase lasted until March 1866 when work stopped due to the war with Spain.

In 1868, Don Diego Mas<U+00ED>as brought in [[Henry Meiggs]], a North American who had been a contractor in both New Jersey and in Chile, who had been working in Chile.  The audacious Meiggs, after some negotiation, appeared before the government on [[21 September]] of that year proposing to design and construct a railroad between Lima and Jauja.  Meiggs reportedly told the government, "I will place rails there, where the flames walk."  The studies were approved and, with a construction budget that had climbed to 27 million pounds, Meiggs' proposal was accepted. The contract specified that work had to be completed within six years and would be financed by the sale of special bonds, with an annual interest of 6% and amortization of 2% ten years after their sale.

The contract was finalized and signed on [[December 23]], [[1869]].

Construction began in January 1870 with an elaborate ceremony in which the first stone in the present Monserrate station in Lima was placed. The work began under the direction of Malinowski, head of the Technical Body, and fellow Polish engineer [[Edward Jan Habich]].

== Locomotives ==
In 2006 FCCA began a program to convert five [[General Electric]] C30-7 locomotives and two GE B39 locos to run on compressed natural gas and diesel fuel.<ref>{{cite news | title=Climbing the Andes with dual fuel power | publisher = ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' | author=Jack A Roberson | accessdate = 2007-09-08 | date=2006-07-01 | url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2006/07/4428/climbing_the_andes_with_dual_fuel_power-1.html}}</ref>

== Traffic ==

Traffic includes minerals, fuels, cement and food products.

== Tourism ==
The route has very beautiful landscapes of the Peruvian Andes. Currently FCCA makes several turistic trips a month to [[Huancayo]] <ref>http://www.ferrocarrilcentral.com.pe/en_turismo.html</ref>
