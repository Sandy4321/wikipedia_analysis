'''Albionbaataridae''' is a family of small, [[fossil]] mammals within the order [[Multituberculata]]. Remains are known from the Upper [[Jurassic]] and Lower [[Cretaceous]] of Europe. These [[herbivore]]s lived their obscure lives during the [[Mesozoic]], also known as the "age of the [[dinosaur]]s." They were among the more derived representatives of the informal suborder "[[Plagiaulacida]]". The taxon Albionbaataridae was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Ensom P.C. in 1994.

These creatures have small euro-teeth, which once inhabited small euro-mouths, though long before [[Europa (mythical)|Europa]] was seduced by [[Zeus]]. Expressed rather more knowledgeably, it is a "Shrew-sized taxa that differ from all other multituberculates in having relatively flat, multi-cusped anterior upper premolars, with 10-14 cusps arranged in three rows, rather than 3-4, rarely up to nine high cusps in two rows, and in having lingual slope of all premolars covered by prominent, subparallel ridges...," (Kielan-Jaworowska & Hurum, 2001, p.414).
