'''Vancouver''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]]: {{IPA|[v<U+00E6>n<U+02C8>ku<U+02D0>v<U+025A>]}}) is a city in southwestern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. It is the largest [[census metropolitan area|CMA]] in western Canada and the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|third largest]] in the country. Vancouver is one of the cities of the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] (GVRD) and of the larger [[geographic]] region commonly known as the [[Lower Mainland]] of British Columbia.

The [[Port of Vancouver]] is significant on a world scale, and Vancouver is the third largest film production centre for US-based productions in [[North America]] after [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York]],<ref>[http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/key_sectors/film_tv.htm Film & TV], Vancouver Economic Development Commission.</ref> giving it the nickname of [[Hollywood North]]. In 2010, the city will host the [[2010 Winter Olympics|XXI Olympic Winter Games]] in conjunction with nearby [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. In 2006, Vancouver was ranked the 56th most expensive city to live among 144 major cities in the world, and the 2nd most expensive in Canada (after [[Toronto]]).<ref>{{cite news|first=Eric|last=Beauchesne|title=Toronto pegged as priciest place to live in Canada|publisher=CanWest News Service|date=[[2006-06-24]]|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=245b1dc8-1b43-46cb-bd84-6e78ab8a5afb&k=54140|accessdate= 2006-06-24}}</ref> Despite this, Vancouver is consistently ranked in the top five most livable cities in the world.<ref>>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2299119.stm Vancouver and Melbourne top city league], ''BBC News'', [[4 October]] [[2002]]; >[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4306936.stm Vancouver is 'best place to live'], ''BBC News'', [[4 October]] [[2005]]; [http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/03/03/cities030303 Vancouver world's second-best place to live: survey], ''CBC News'', [[3 March]] [[2003]]; [http://www.concierge.com/bestof/readerschoice/top_cities/topcities_americas ''Cond<U+00E9> Nast Traveler'', Readers Choice Awards 2005]</ref>

The city's population is estimated to be 583,267 (2005 est.)<ref>{{cite web| title= BC Municipal Population Estimates, 1996-2005, Sorted by Size| url=http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/data/pop/pop/mun/Mun9605s.asp |publisher=BC Stats |accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> and that of the metropolitan area 2,208,300 (2005 est.).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo05a.htm |title=Population of census metropolitan areas (2001 Census boundaries) |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref>  Some predict that by 2020, the population of the metropolitan area will be 2.6&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_2020_2.html Urban Statistics - 2020 projection], City Mayors.</ref> A resident of Vancouver is called a "Vancouverite."

==History==
{{Main|History of Vancouver}}

Archaeological records indicate the presence of [[First Nations|Aboriginal peoples]] ([[Sto:lo]]) in the Vancouver area from 3,500-9,000 years ago.<ref>[http://home.istar.ca/~bthom/LONGTERM-FIN.htm Brian Thom, "St<U+00F3>:lo Culture - Ideas of Prehistory and Changing Cultural Relationships to the Land and Environment"]</ref> Captain [[George Vancouver]] explored the [[Burrard Inlet]] in 1792, giving various parts of the area [[United Kingdom|British]] names.<ref name="Caroun">{{cite web|title=Canada: History of Vancouver|url=http://www.caroun.com/Countries/America/Canada/Vancouver/2-VancouverHistory.html|accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref>
[[Image: First Vancouver Council Meeting after fire.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Re-enactment of the first Vancouver City Council meeting after the 1886 fire.[http://www.lestwarog.com/newsArticle-1945.html]]]
In 1808, [[Simon Fraser (explorer)|Simon Fraser]] arrived in what is now [[Marpole]]. He was searching for the [[Columbia River]], but soon discovered that he was not in Columbia and was captured by natives. The river he did search was later renamed after him.<ref name="Caroun"/> The gold rush of 1858-1859 brought 25,000 men, mainly from [[California]], to the Fraser River and what would become Vancouver.<ref name="Vancouver's past">{{cite book|title=Vancouver's Past|last=Hull|first=Raymond|coauthors=Soules, Gordon, Soules, Christine|id=ISBN 0295953640}}</ref> During the 1898 [[Klondike gold rush]], Vancouver merchants sold a great deal of equipment to prospectors.<ref name="Vancouver's past"/>

==Geography==
[[Image:Strait of Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Strait of Georgia.]]
Vancouver is adjacent to the [[Strait of Georgia]], a body of [[water]] that is shielded from the [[Pacific Ocean]] by [[Vancouver Island]]. It is in the Pacific [[Time Zone]] (UTC-8) and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.<ref>[http://www.ec.gc.ca/soer-ree/English/Framework/NarDesc/pacmar_e.cfm Pacific Maritime Ecozone], Environment Canada.</ref> The city itself forms part of the [[Burrard Peninsula]], lying between [[Burrard Inlet]] to the north and the [[Fraser River]] to the south. Those unfamiliar with the region may be surprised to learn that Vancouver is not on [[Vancouver Island]]. However, both the island and the city (and its [[Vancouver, Washington|U.S. counterpart]]) are named after [[Royal Navy]] Captain [[George Vancouver]].

Vancouver is internationally renowned for its beautiful scenery<ref>{{cite web|title=World66 - Vancouver Travel Guide|url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/canada/britishcolumbia/vancouver|accessdate|2006-10-18}}</ref> and has one of North America's largest urban parks, [[Stanley Park]]. The [[North Shore Mountains]] dominate the city landscape and on a clear day scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano [[Mount Baker]] in the State of [[Washington]] to the southeast, [[Vancouver Island]] across the [[Strait of Georgia]] to the west and southwest, and the [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]] to the northwest.

Vancouver has an area of 114.67 km<U+00B2> (44 sq miles), including both flat and hilly ground. The [[climate]] is wet and the city is surrounded by water. Early records show that there may have been as many as fifty creeks and streams in the area although only four remain. {{see|Bodies of water in Vancouver}}

===Climate===
[[Image:Stanley Park 1999 Rain.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A rainy day at Third Beach and [[Siwash Rock]] in [[Stanley Park]]]]
{{Main|Climate of Vancouver}}

Vancouver's climate is unusually temperate by Canadian standards; its winters are the fourth warmest of Canadian cities monitored by [[Environment Canada]] after nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Nanaimo, British Columbia|Nanaimo]], and [[Duncan, British Columbia|Duncan]],<ref>[http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/element.cfm?lang=e Weather Winners &mdash; Mildest Winters], Environment Canada.</ref> all of which are found on Vancouver Island. Vancouver has daily minimum temperatures falling below 0<U+00B0>C (32<U+00B0>F) on an average of 46 days per year and below -10<U+00B0>C (14<U+00B0>F) on only two days per year. The annual precipitation is about 1,219 mm (48 in) <ref name="aboutvancouver">{{cite web|url=http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/aboutvan.htm|title=City of Vancouver - About Vancouver|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> Summer months are generally sunny with moderate temperatures but can be very dry, often resulting in yellow grass in parks and lawns. The daily maximum averages 22<U+00B0>C (72<U+00B0>F) in July and August, although sometimes temperatures rise above 26<U+00B0>C (78<U+00B0>F).<ref>{{cite web|title=British Columbia - Weather and Climate|url=http://www.britishcolumbia.com/information/details.asp?id=16|accessdate=2006-10-08}}</ref> More than half of all winter days receive measureable precipitation. Snow falls on only 11 of those days on average, with only three days receiving 6 or more centimetres.

Despite 59% of hours in Vancouver having 80-100% cloud cover, Vancouver also averages 288 days per year with measurable [[sunlight|sunshine]].<ref>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=ALL&StationName=vancouver&SearchType=BeginsWith&LocateBy=Province&Proximity=25&ProximityFrom=City&StationNumber=&IDType=MSC&CityName=&ParkName=&LatitudeDegrees=&LatitudeMinutes=&LongitudeDegrees=&LongitudeMinutes=&NormalsClass=A&SelNormals=&StnId=889& Canadian Climate Normals 1971-2000], Environment Canada.</ref>

===Flora===
The original vegetation of most of Vancouver and its suburbs was dense [[temperate rain forest]], mostly conifers with scattered pockets of maple and alder, as well as large areas of swampland (even in upland areas due to poor drainage). The conifers were a typical coastal BC mix of [[Sitka spruce]], [[Western red cedar]], [[Western hemlock]], [[Douglas fir]], and [[yew]], and were reckoned to be the greatest concentration of the largest of these trees on the entire [[British Columbia Coast]]. Only in [[Seattle]]'s [[Elliott Bay]] did the trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay in size. The largest trees in Vancouver's old-growth forest were in the area of what is now [[Gastown]], where the first logging occurred, and on the south slopes of [[False Creek]] and [[English Bay]], especially around [[Jericho Beach]]. Stanley Park is mostly second and third growth and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as [[springboard]] notches can still be seen there.
[[Image:vanc_scenery2006.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stanley Park and a Downtown residential area.]]
A diverse range of plants and trees were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and can be found growing throughout Vancouver and the [[Lower Mainland]]. Various species of palm trees have proven hardy in this climate and are a common sight, as are large numbers of other exotic trees such as the [[monkey puzzle tree]], the [[Japanese maple]], and various flowering exotics such as [[magnolias]], [[azaleas]], and [[rhododendrons]]. Many rhododendrons have grown to immense sizes, as have other species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe. The native [[List of Acer species|Douglas maple]] can also attain a tremendous size. Many streets in the city are lined with flowering varieties of [[Japanese cherry]] trees that were donated by [[Japan]] in the 1930s. Certain areas of [[West Vancouver]] that have the right balance of sunlight and rainfall are home to the [[arbutus]] ([[Arbutus menziesii]]), which is more associated with the climate of the [[Gulf Islands]], [[Greater Victoria]], and northern [[Puget Sound]].

===Air pollution===
The air quality in the city has been deteriorating over the last several decades due to an increasing number of cars in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoinfo.org/env_ind/region/smog/smog_e.cfm|title=Ecosystem Information|accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref> Smog can be seen year around. Vancouver is a fast-growing city mainly as a result of a high immigration rate,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/research/papers/census2001/vancouver/parta.html|title=Recent Immigrants in Metropolitan Areas: Vancouver<U+2014>A Comparative Profile Based on the 2001 Census"|accessdate=2006-10-09}}</ref> but the car population is growing at almost twice the speed of the human population <ref>[http://www.earthfuture.com/community/carsharevancouver.asp Earth Future - Car Sharing in Vanvouver]</ref>, resulting in increased congestion and pollution. Some actions have be taken by various levels of government to limit the problem, such as improving automobile efficiency, promoting cleaner fuels, and relocating [[beehive burner]]s. Air quality in the Fraser Valley often suffers as Vancouver's pollution is blown in that direction and "boxed in" by the mountains. Air quality measurements for the Lower Fraser Valley, including Vancouver, are updated and published every hour online by the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]].<ref>[http://www.gvrd.bc.ca/aqi/chartpage.asp?SEL=H&TS=T001 Greater Vancouver Area - Air quality measurements], Greater Vancouver Regional District.</ref>

==Social fabric==
Vancouver is considered to be a relaxed city, particularly by North American standards. There is a lively cultural scene, many diversions, and year-round access to outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, boating, and skiing. Some have called it a "city of neighbourhoods", each with a distinct character and ethnic mix. 

Vancouver's population density on the downtown peninsula is 49 people per acre (2001 census).<ref>[http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/commsvcs/cityplans/CityFacts04.pdf City facts 2004 (PDF)], City of Vancouver.</ref> City planners in the late 1950s and 1960s deliberately encouraged the development of high-rise residential towers in the [[West End, Vancouver|West End]] downtown neighbourhood, which has resulted in a compact, pedestrian/transit/bike friendly urban core. Vancouver continues to pursue policies intended to increase density as an alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]], such as Mayor [[Sam Sullivan|Sullivan]]'s Eco-Density initiative.

===Demographics===
[[Image:Punjabi Market Vancouver street sign.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Punjabi street sign on Main Street]]
{{Main|Demographics of Vancouver}}

The [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] are by far the largest visible ethnic minority group in the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visible minorities (2001 census|url=http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/demo53e.htm|accessdate=2006-10-19}}</ref> Vancouver has one of the most diverse Chinese-speaking communities, with several dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] being represented.<ref name="GVB"/>  Vancouver contains the second largest [[Chinatown (Vancouver)|Chinatown]] in North America (after [[San Francisco]] [[San Francisco Chinatown|Chinatown]]). There are also many multicultural neighbourhoods, such as the [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Punjabi Market]], [[Little Italy, Vancouver|Little Italy]], [[Greektown, Vancouver|Greektown]], [[Japantown, Vancouver|Japantown]], [[Commercial Drive]], and a series of [[Koreatown, Vancouver|Koreatowns]]. Bilingual street signs can be seen in various neighbourhoods, including Chinatown and the Punjabi Market.
[[Image:Chinatown vancouver streetsign.jpg|thumb|left|A bilingual street sign in Chinatown.]]

Many immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] made Vancouver their home following the transfer of sovereignty of that former British colony from the United Kingdom to China. This continued a tradition of immigration from around the world that had already established Vancouver as the second most multi-ethnic of Canada's cities (after [[Toronto]]) before the Hong Kong influx began. Other significant Asian ethnic groups in Vancouver are South Asians (mostly Punjabis, usually referred to as Indo-Canadians), [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Filipino people|Filipino]], [[Korean people|Korean]], [[Cambodian people|Cambodian]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]].

Non-visible minorities, such as newly-arrived Eastern Europeans and the new wave of Latin American arrivals, are also a feature of the city's ethnic landscape. Prior to the Hong Kong influx of the 1980s, the largest non-British ethnic group in the city was German, followed by Ukrainian and the Scandinavian ethnicities. 

There is also a sizable community of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] people in Vancouver as well as in the surrounding metropolitan region, with the result that Vancouver constitutes the largest native community in the province.<ref>{{cite web|title=Statistics Canada (2001 census)|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/Profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=5915022&Geo2=PR&Code2=59&Data=Count&SearchText=Vancouver&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=|accessdate=2006-10-18}}</ref>

===Lifestyle===
The city has adopted a ''Four Pillars Drug Strategy'',<ref>[http://www.vancouver.ca/fourpillars/ Four Pillars Drug Strategy]</ref> which combines harm reduction (e.g. needle exchanges, supervised injection sites) with treatment, enforcement, and prevention. The strategy is largely a response to endemic [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]] among injection drug users in the city's [[Downtown Eastside]] neighbourhood. The area is characterized by entrenched poverty, the commercial sex trade, and an [[AIDS]] epidemic that in the 1990s became the worst in the developed world. Some community and professional groups &mdash; such as ''From Grief to Action''[http://www.fromgrieftoaction.org/] and ''Keeping the Door Open''[http://www.keepingthedooropen.com/] &mdash; are fostering public dialogue in the city about further alternatives to current drug policies.

The former mayor, Larry Campbell, came to office in 2002 in part because of his willingness to champion alternative interventions for drug issues, such as supervised injection sites. Although it is technically illegal, Vancouver police generally do not arrest people for possessing small amounts of [[marijuana]]. Police have, however, been involved in raids on storefront businesses that openly sold marijuana (such as the Da Kine Cafe) and have aggressive programs to shut down hydroponic marijuana growing operations (nicknamed "grow-ops") in residential areas.{{fact}}

While not completely free of racial tension, Vancouver has relatively harmonious race relations.<ref>[http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/commsvcs/socialplanning/initiatives/multicult/index.htm Multiculturalism & Diversity]. City of Vancouver.</ref> One result is a relatively high rate of intermarriage; mixed ethnicity couples are unremarkable in any neighbourhood.  Sushi is one of the most popular foods in the city, with more than 300 sushi restaurants in the metropolitan area. Both the annual Dragon Boat Festival and Lunar New Year's Day Parade are well attended by residents of all ethnic backgrounds. Vancouver has a relatively large music and arts scene and one of the largest [[gay community|gay communities]] in [[North America]]. The area of downtown along Davie Street is home to most of the city's gay clubs and bars and is known as Davie Village. Every year Vancouver holds one of the country's largest Gay Pride Parades.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Vancouver Pride Society|title=Sponsorship Package|url=http://www.vancouverpride.ca/images/docs/2006VPSSponsorshipPackage.pdf|format=pdf}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vancouver}}

With its location on the [[Pacific Rim]] and at the western terminus of Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway|transcontinental highway]] and rail routes, Vancouver is one of the nation's largest industrial centres.

The [[Port of Vancouver]], Canada's largest and most diversified, does more than $43 billion in trade with over 90 countries annually. Port activities generate $4 billion in gross domestic product and $8.9 billion in economic output.

Vancouver is the headquarters of [[Forestry|forest product]] and [[mining]] companies. In recent years, Vancouver has become an increasingly important centre for [[software development]], [[biotechnology]] and a vibrant [[film industry]]. 

The city<U+2019>s scenic location makes it a major tourist destination. Visitors come for the city<U+2019>s gardens, [[Stanley Park]], Queen Elizabeth Park, and a combination of mountains, ocean, forest and parklands surrounding the city. The numerous beaches, parks, waterfronts, and mountain backdrop, combined with its cultural and multi-ethnic character, all contribute to its unique appeal and style for tourists. Over a million people annually pass through Vancouver en route to a [[cruise ship]] vacation, usually to [[Alaska]]. 

The city's popularity comes with a price. Vancouver can be an expensive city, with the highest housing prices in Canada. Several 2006 studies rank Vancouver as having the least affordable housing in Canada, one ranking it fifteenth least affordable in the world, marginally more affordable than [[London]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Fiona|last=Anderson|title=Vancouver housing 'severely unaffordable'|publisher=CanWest News Service|date=[[2006-01-30]]|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=ff7fd1e0-f52e-4de7-af5b-6117dc6cded5|accessdate=2006-09-01}}; [http://www.demographia.com/dhi-ix2005q3.pdf Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2006, Wendell Cox Consultancy.}}; [http://www.rbc.com/economics/market/pdf/house.pdf RBC Financial Group "Housing Affordability"], RBC Financial Group, September 2006. Retrieved 2006-09-27.</ref> The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs, including cooperative housing, legalized secondary suites, increased density and [[smart growth]]. Nevertheless, as with many other cities in North America, homelessness is a concern, as is the growing gap between [[wealth|rich]] and [[poverty|poor]]. The city<U+2019>s residents are generally affluent, a perception reinforced by the number of [[luxury vehicles]] on city streets, the rate at which residential properties sell (median house price $741,000, Greater Vancouver, 3rd Quarter 2006), and, according to the Vancouver Sun, the fact that Vancouverites are three times more likely to dine out than other Canadians. The issue of house prices is most evident because as of July 2006, 30% of all houses in Vancouver are listed at over a million dollars, which makes the city more expensive than in any other major Canadian city, with Toronto in second, with house prices averaging $370,000 in comparison. It should be noted that a number of municipalities in British Columbia within 2-3 hours from Vancouver, such as Whistler, Victoria, Langley, have average house prices ranging from $500,000 to 2.5 million dollars. <ref>[http://www.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/bestplacestolive/index.jsp?pageID=article&year=2006&content=homeprices&type=homeprices Canadian Business] - House pricing in Whistler</ref> 

A major and ongoing downtown condominium construction boom began in the late 1990s, financed in large part by a huge flow of capital from [[Hong Kong]] immigrants prior to the [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|1997 hand-over]] to [[China]]. High-rise residential developments from this period now dominate the Yaletown and Coal Harbour districts of the downtown peninsula, and also cluster around some of the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] stations on the east side of the city.  

The [[1986 World Exposition]] was held in Vancouver. This [[World's Fair]] was the last to be held in North America and was considered a success.

== Governance ==
{{main|Government and politics of Vancouver}}
<!-- restored city hall pic. To the editor who removed it originaly: please leave a message on the talk page if you wish to remove it agian. Thanks. -->
Vancouver is governed by the ten-member [[Vancouver City Council]], a nine-member School Board, and a seven-member Parks Board, all elected for three-year terms through an at-large system. 

Historically, in all levels of government, the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along [[conservatism|conservative]] or [[centre-right]] lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along [[left-wing]] lines. This was reaffirmed with the results of the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 provincial election]].
=== Politics ===
[[Image:Sam_Sullivan_portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Sam Sullivan, Mayor of Vancouver.]]
Though polarized, a political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around a number of issues. Protection of urban parks, a focus on the development of rapid transit as opposed to a freeway system, a harm reduction approach to illegal drug use and a general concern about community based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the [[political spectrum]] in Vancouver.

In the [[Vancouver municipal election, 2005|2005 Municipal Election]] elections, City Council swung back to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] after a term dominated by the leftist [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE). [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA) mayoral candidate [[Sam Sullivan]] narrowly defeated [[Jim Green]] for the position of mayor and was joined by 5 of his party's members on Council. The centrist [[Vision Vancouver]] (VVN) brought 4 members to Council with the final seat going to COPE. The NPA also won 6 of 9 School Board seats and 5 of 7 Parks Board seats, while the remaining Board seats were won by COPE. Former Mayor [[Larry Campbell]] chose not to run for re-election and was subsequently appointed to the [[Senate of Canada]]. 	 

In the [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia]], Vancouver has ten constituencies: in the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 provincial election]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal Party]] and the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|BC New Democratic Party]] each won five seats.

In the [[Canadian House of Commons]], Vancouver has five constituencies: in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal elections]], the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] won four seats and the [[New Democratic Party]] one. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal elections]], all the same MPs were re-elected. However, on [[February 6]], [[2006]], [[David Emerson]] of [[Vancouver Kingsway]] defected to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]], giving the Conservatives one seat in Vancouver. As of February 2006, the Liberals hold three seats, and the NDP and the Conservatives hold one each.

=== Law and order ===
While most of the Lower Mainland is policed by the [[RCMP]]'s "E" Division, <ref>[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/bc/about_ediv/index_e.htm RCMP "E" Division's official website]</ref> Vancouver has its own [[Vancouver Police Department|city police force]] (as do [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]], [[West Vancouver, British Columbia|West Vancouver]], [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]], and [[Port Moody, British Columbia|Port Moody]]), with a strength of 1174 sworn members and an operating budget of almost $150,000,000 (in 2005 figures).<ref>[http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/police/Planning/Reports/2005AnnualReport.pdf  ''Beyond the Call: Vancouver Police Department Annual Report, 2005'', 3]; [http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/police/policeboard/financial/OperatingResults0405.pdf  ''Vancouver Police Department Operating Results'', 2005.]</ref> Over 16% of the city's budget was spent on police protection in 2005.<ref>[http://vancouver.ca/publications/pdf/COVannualreport2005.pdf  City of Vancouver, ''2005 Annual Report'', 31.]</ref> The Vancouver Police has numerous operational divisions, including a bicycle squad, a marine squad, and a dog squad.

As of 2005, Vancouver (CMA) had the fourth highest crime rate among all Canadian cities.<ref>[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060720/d060720b.htm Vancouver crime statistics]. Statistics Canada.</ref> However, as with other Canadian cities, the over-all crime rate has been falling "dramatically."<ref>[http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/police/Planning/Reports/2005AnnualReport.pdf  Chief Constable Jamie Graham, "What a Difference a Year Makes," ''Beyond the Call: Vancouver Police Department Annual Report, 2005'', 1.] and [http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060720/d060720b.htm Vancouver crime statistics].

==Transportation==
{{main|Transportation in Vancouver}}
City councils, as part of a long term plan, prohibited the construction of freeways in the 1980s. Because of this, Vancouver passed [[Melbourne]] as the world's most livable city.<ref>{{cite news|last=Millar|first=Royce|title=No freeways puts Vancouver on top|date=2006-09-11|work=The Age|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/09/10/1157826813807.html}}</ref> The only major freeway within city limits is [[Trans-Canada Highway|Highway 1]], which passes through the eastern edge of the city.

[[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] transportation authority, is responsible for roads and public transportation within region. It provides [[bus]] service, [[B-Line]] Rapid Bus Service (2 of the 3 B-Lines run in Vancouver with 2 more B-Line's by 2008),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.translink.bc.ca/files/pdf/plan_proj/2006_Transportation_Plan.pdf|title=2006 Transportation plan|format=PDF}}</ref> a foot passenger and bicycle ferry service (known as [[SeaBus]]), a two-line automated [[metro]] system called [[Vancouver SkyTrain|SkyTrain]], and the commuter rail [[West Coast Express]].  Future projects include the [[Canada Line]], a commuter metro line will connect YVR (Vancouver International Airport) and the neighbooring municipality, Richmond together from Downtown in less than 26 min. (2009).

Inter-city passenger rail service is operated from [[Pacific Central Station (Vancouver)|Pacific Central Station]] by [[VIA Rail]] to points east; [[Amtrak Cascades]] to [[Seattle, Washington]]; and [[Rocky Mountaineer]] rail tour routes.  The city is also served by two [[British Columbia Ferry Corporation|B.C. Ferries]] terminals.  One is to the northwest at [[Horseshoe Bay, British Columbia|Horseshoe Bay]], [[West Vancouver, British Columbia|West Vancouver]], and the other is to the south, at [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen]] (in [[Delta, British Columbia|Delta]]).

Vancouver is served by [[Vancouver International Airport]] (YVR), located on [[Sea Island, British Columbia|Sea Island]] in the City of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], immediately south of Vancouver. Vancouver's airport is Canada's second busiest airport and the second largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. [[HeliJet]] and two [[float plane]] companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour.

==Education==
Vancouver is served by [[School District 39 Vancouver]], the second largest [[school district]] in British Columbia.<ref>[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/review/039_2005.pdf District Review Report, School District No. 39 Vancouver] <small>(PDF)</small></ref>  As in other parts of the province, numerous [[independent school]]s are also eligible for provincial funding - including [[religious school]]s, [[Secularism|non-denominational]] schools, and [[Special education|special-needs]] schools, nearly all of which also charge tuition. Also, Vancouver includes several elementary and secondary schools that are part of the province-wide CSF (Conseil Scolaire Francophone), the francophone public school district.

Vancouver is served by the Lower Mainland's two major public universities, the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) and [[Simon Fraser University]] (SFU). UBC and SFU have satellite [[campus|campuses]] within the city, as does the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] which provides [[polytechnic]] education and grants [[Academic degree|degree]]s in several fields. [[Vancouver Community College]] and [[Langara College]], along with other colleges in surrounding communities, provide career, trade, and university-transfer programs for Vancouver residents. [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] grants certificates, diplomas, and degrees in art and design.

==Architecture==
[[Image:Van City Hall 2010 Flag.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vancouver City Hall]] with the 2010 Winter Olympics Flag.]]
Notable buildings within the city include [[Christ Church Cathedral (Vancouver)|Christ Church Cathedral]], the [[Hotel Vancouver]], the [[Museum of Anthropology]] ([[Arthur Erickson]], architect) at the [[University of British Columbia]], and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]]. There are several striking modern buildings in the downtown area, including the Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as Robson Square ([[Arthur Erickson]]) and the [[Vancouver Library Square]] ([[Moshe Safdie]], architect), reminiscent of the Colosseum in Rome. The original [[BC Hydro]] headquarters building at Nelson & Burrard Streets is a [[modernism|modernist]] high-rise, now converted into the Electra condominiums. Also notable is the "concrete waffle" of the MacMillan-Bloedel building on the north-east corner of the Georgia and Thurlow intersection. A prominent addition to the city's landscape is the giant tent-frame [[Canada Place]], the former Canada Pavilion from [[Expo '86]], which includes the [[Vancouver Convention & Exhibition Centre|Trade and Convention Centre]] as well as a Cruise Ship Terminal and the Pan-Pacific Hotel. Two modern skyscrapers that define the skyline looking south are the city hall and the Centennial Pavilion of Vancouver Hospital, both by Townley and Matheson (1936 and 1958 respectively).

A collection of Edwardian buildings in the city's old downtown core were, in their day, the tallest buildings in the [[British Empire]]. These were, in succession, the Province Building, the [[Dominion Building]] (1907. both at Cambie & Hastings Streets), and the [[Sun Tower]] (1911) at Beatty and Pender Streets. The Sun Tower's cupola was finally exceeded as the Empire's tallest by the elaborate Art Deco-flavoured [[Marine Building]] in the 1920s. The Marine Building is known for its elaborate ceramic tile facings and brass-gilt doors and elevators, which make it a favourite location for movie shoots. Another famous Edwardian building in the city is the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] building, designed by Francis Mawson Rattenbury who also designed the provincial Legislature and the original and highly decorative [[Hotel Vancouver]] (torn down after WWII as a condition of the completion of the new Hotel Vancouver a block away).
[[Image:Vancityskyline cropped.jpg|thumb|right|600px|Downtown Vancouver as seen from Spanish Banks.]]
Topping the list of [[List of Vancouver's 10 tallest skyscrapers|tallest buildings in Vancouver]] as of June 2006 is [[One Wall Centre]] at 150&nbsp;m and 48&nbsp;storeys, followed closely by the [[Shaw Tower (Vancouver)|Shaw Tower]] at 149&nbsp;m and 41&nbsp;storeys. 

====Skyline====
The View Protection Guidelines were approved in [[1989]] and amended in [[1990]], establishing view corridors in the downtown with height limits to protect views of the [[North Shore Mountains]]. These guidelines have succeeded in preserving mountain views, although some find Vancouver's skyline flat and lacking in visual interest. Many agree that there is a need for some taller buildings to reflect Vancouver's contemporary image, but others are concerned about proposals for much higher buildings. Many believe that the natural setting, and in particular, views of the [[North Shore Mountains]], may be hindered as tall buildings grow in number. In response to these concerns, [[Vancouver City Council|Council]] commissioned a "Skyline Study" in [[1997]].
[[Image:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|left|Skyline of the northern shore of [[False Creek]]]]
The Skyline Study concluded that Vancouver's skyline would benefit from the addition of a handful of buildings exceeding current height limits, to add visual interest to Vancouver's skyline. This led to the ''General Policy on Higher Buildings''. The study noted that the opportunities for such buildings were restricted due to a limited number of large development sites in the downtown. There were at least five sites identified where buildings exceeding the 450 foot height limit are possible and at least two sites in the northwest corner of the central business district where heights up to 400 feet (exceeding the 300 foot limit) might be considered..<ref>[http://www.vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/970407/skyline.htm  City of Vancouver Special Council Meeting Minutes - Downtown Vancouver Skyline Study, 7 and 23 April 1997]; [http://www.city.vancouver.bc.ca/COMMSVCS/Guidelines/H005.pdf  City of Vancouver, "General Policy for Higher Buildings," 6 May 1997].</ref> Eight years later, five of the seven identified sites for higher buildings have been developed or are in the development application process. The tallest of these new buildings is the [[Living Shangri-La (Vancouver)|Living Shangri-La]] hotel/residential tower, which when completed in 2007 will stand 197 m tall (61 storeys).<ref>http://www.skyscrapernews.com/news.php?ref=708  "Shangri Las Vancouver Classy Skyline Peak," from skyscrapernews.com [online], 31 August 2006.</ref>

==Arts and culture==
===Theatre and the arts===
Prominent theatre companies in Vancouver include the [[Arts Club Theatre Company]], the [[Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company]], and [[Bard on the Beach]]. Smaller companies include [[Touchstone Theatre]], [[Carousel Theatre]], and the [[United Players of Vancouver]]. Until 2005, [[Theatre Under the Stars]] produced shows at Malkin Bowl in Stanley Park. In addition, Vancouver holds an annual [[Vancouver Fringe Festival|Fringe Festival]] and [[Vancouver International Film Festival|International Film Festival]].

Vancouver is the home to a number of museums and galleries. The [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] has a permanent collection of over 7,900 items and is the home of a significant number of works by [[Emily Carr]]. The [[Vancouver Maritime Museum]] is a nautical museum with the [[St. Roch]], an historic [[arctic]] exploration ship, as its centrepiece. The [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]] is a leading museum of [[Pacific Northwest|Pacific Northwest Coast]] [[First Nations]] culture and the [[Vancouver Museum]] is the largest civic museum in Canada. More interactive museums include [[Science World at TELUS World of Science|Science World]] and the [[Storyeum]].

In 1986, Greater Vancouver<U+2019>s cultural community created the Alliance for Arts and Culture to provide a strong voice for the sector and an avenue to work together. This coalition now numbers more than 320 arts groups and individuals. The Alliances mission is to, "strive towards an environment that recognizes, respects, and responds to the contribution our sector makes to society<U+2019>s well-being."

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Vancouver}}
[[Image:Vogue-thtr.jpg|thumb|150px|The Vogue Theatre]]
Vancouver is a major regional centre for the development of Canadian music. The city's musical contributions include performers of classical, folk and popular music. <!--not that I like any of them, but a listing of noted classical composers and performers resident/emergent is needed-->

The city played an important role in the development of [[punk rock]], perhaps most famously including the band [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]], [[Nomeansno]], and the [[industrial music|industrial]] group [[Skinny Puppy]]. Other Vancouver bands who achieved stardom in London during the punk era were [[The Pointed Sticks]], [[I, Braineater]], [[U-J3RK5]] (pronounced "you jerk": the five is silent), the [[Young Canadians]] (originally the K-Tels) and [[The Modernettes]]. Vancouver was also where the punk movie "Terminal City Ricochet" was filmed; the movie's name comes from a hockey team called the Terminal City Ricochets.

Mainstream pop music has featured bands and performers such as [[Prism (band)|Prism]], [[Trooper (band)|Trooper]], [[Chilliwack (band)|Chilliwack]], [[Econoline Crush]], and [[Bryan Adams]]. <!--this is a big list of names; why none were mentioned when cantopop was placed FIRST was kinda grating, actually....-->  Some music stars whose names were made "at large" have chosen Vancouver as their residence: [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Jerry Doucette]], [[Randy Bachman]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Jim Byrnes]] and more.  

Larger performances are usually held at venues such as [[GM Place]], [[BC Place Stadium]] or the [[Pacific Coliseum]], while smaller acts are held at places such as the [[Plaza of Nations]], the [[Commodore Ballroom]], the [[Orpheum, Vancouver|Orpheum Theatre]] and the [[Vogue Theatre (Vancouver)|Vogue Theatre]].

Vancouver also hosts two significant annual music festivals. The [[Vancouver Folk Music Festival|International Folk Music Festival]] and the [[Vancouver International Jazz Festival|International Jazz Festival]] showcases music in their respective genres from around the world.

Vancouver is home to two professional orchestras: the [[CBC Radio Orchestra]] and the [[Vancouver Symphony Orchestra]]. It is also home to a major opera company, the [[Vancouver Opera]], and numerous regional opera companies throughout the metropolitan area.<!--also regional symphonies, e.g. the New Westminster Philharmonic; not just opera companies should be here, but also things like the Royal City Musical Theatre and more-->

Vancouver's large Chinese population has a significant music scene, which has produced several [[Cantopop]] stars. Similarly, various Indo-Canadian artists and actors have a profile in [[Bollywood]] or other aspects of India's entertainment industry.

===Sports and recreation===
[[Image:BCPLACESTADIUM.jpg|thumb|right|225px|BC Place Stadium, home of the BC Lions.]]
{{Main|Sports in Vancouver}}
The mild climate of the city and close proximity to ocean, mountains, rivers and lakes make the area a popular destination for outdoor recreation. Indeed, Vancouver has a low adult obesity rate of 12% compared to the Canadian average, 23%;<ref>[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/060822/d060822b.htm Health Reports: Regional differences in obesity], Statistics Canada, [[22 August]] [[2006]].</ref> but 51% of Vancouverites are overweight, making it the fourth thinnest city in Canada after Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax.<ref>{{cite news|first=Sharon|last=Kirkey|title=Suburban Sprawl|publisher=CanWest News Service|date=[[2006-08-23]]|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=eee5654b-03e0-4dc3-8e3c-c116ee68a15c&k=82271&p=2|accessdate= 2006-09-01}}</ref>

Vancouver has over 2,700 acres (11 km<U+00B2>) of parks, with [[Stanley Park]] being the largest. The municipality also has several large beaches, many flowing into each other, with the largest groups extending from the coast of Stanley Park before reaching False Creek, and on the other side of English Bay, starting in the Kitsilano neighbourhood all the way to the [[University Endowment Lands]], which are separate from Vancouver. The 18 kilometres (11 miles) of beaches that surround Vancouver include English Bay (First Beach), Jericho, [[Kitsilano Beach]], Locarno, Second Beach (Stanley Park), [[Spanish Bank]] East, Spanish Bank Extension, Spanish Bank West, Sunset, and Third Beach (Stanley Park). The coastline provides for many types of water sport, and the city is a popular destination for boating enthusiasts.

The nearby [[North Shore (Greater Vancouver)|North Shore]] mountains are home to three ski hills - [[Cypress Provincial Park|Cypress Bowl]], [[Grouse Mountain]], and [[Mount Seymour]] - each within 20 to 30 minutes of downtown Vancouver. Mountain bikers have created world-renowned trails across the North Shore. Three rivers - [[Capilano River]], Lynn Creek, Seymour River - each within 20 minutes of downtown provide opportunities to white water enthusiasts during periods of rain and spring melt. 

Nightlife in Vancouver had, for years, been seen as restricted in comparison to other cities, with early closing times for bars and night clubs, and a reluctance by authorities to allow for further development. However, in the past few years, Vancouver has experimented with later closing hours and relaxed regulations, and an effort has been made to develop the Downtown core even further as an entertainment district, especially on and around Granville Street.

Vancouver will be the host city for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], and the 2009 [[World Police and Fire Games]]. [[Swangard Stadium]], just across the city line in [[Burnaby]], will host some games for the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].

<!--The 9'O Clock Gun looks like trivia to me. A simple comment out for now..
===9 O'Clock Gun===
[[Image:VancouverCannon.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[9 O'Clock Gun]]]]
Every evening an automated cannon (the [[9 O'Clock Gun]]), situated on the Brockton Point peninsula in [[Stanley Park]] facing [[Coal Harbour]] and downtown, is fired. It is loud enough to be heard throughout the larger region.  Its original purpose was for ship's captains in harbours to regularize their [[chronometers]].-->
