==Life==
Josie Petrick Kemarre was born around 1953 at the Santa Teresa Mission, near [[Alice Springs]] in Australia's Northern Territory.<ref name="Birnberg125">{{cite book|last=Birnberg|first=Margo|coauthors=Janusz Kreczmanski|title=Aboriginal Artist Dictionary of Biographies: Australian Western, Central Desert and Kimberley Region|publisher=J.B. Publishing|location=Marleston, South Australia|year=2004|page=125|isbn=1-876622-47-4}}</ref> Kemarre is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of eight used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of the Anmatyerre people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=23 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&date=2010-10-11|archivedate=12 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="de Brabander">{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra, ACT|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=9780855752347}}</ref> Thus Josie Petrick is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. Josie Petrick began painting for Mbantua Gallery, in central Australia, in 2008 and indicated to the gallery that her name was Josepha rather than Josie, and that this was how she henceforth wished to be known;<ref name="Mbantua"/> however Mbantua's biography is the only source that uses that version of her name.

Married to Robin Petyarre, brother of artist [[Gloria Petyarre]], Josie Petrick moved to the region of [[Utopia, Northern Territory|Utopia]], north-east of Alice Springs. They had seven children. By 2008, Robin had died;<ref name="Mbantua"/> their son Damien Petrick went on to marry and become an artist like his mother.<ref name="Mbantua"/>

==Art==
===Background===
Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, assisted by teacher [[Geoffrey Bardon]].<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last=Bardon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=James Bardon|title=Papunya <U+2013> A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=Miegunyah Press & University of Melbourne|location=Melbourne, VIC|year=2007|ISBN=9780522854343}}</ref> Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983.<ref name="Dussart06">{{cite journal|last=Dussart|first=Francoise|year=2006|title=Canvassing identities: reflecting on the acrylic art movement in an Australian Aboriginal settlement|journal=Aboriginal History|volume=30|pages=156<U+2013>168}}</ref> By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally.<ref name="Morphy99">{{cite book|last=Morphy|first=Howard|title=Aboriginal Art|publisher=Phaidon|location=London|year=1999|pages=261<U+2013>316|ISBN=0714837520}}</ref> The first artists, including all of the founders of the [[Papunya Tula]] artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting.<ref name="Strocchi06">{{cite journal|last=Strocchi|first=Marina|year=2006|title=Minyma Tjukurrpa: Kintore / Haasts Bluff Canvas Project: Dancing women to famous painters|journal=Artlink|volume=26|issue=4}}</ref> However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Utopia, [[Kintore, Northern Territory|Kintore]], [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]], [[Balgo, Western Australia|Balgo]], and on the [[outstation movement|outstations]], people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.<ref name="Morphy99"/>

===Career===
Josie Petrick commenced painting about 1990<ref name="Birnberg125"/> or 1992.<ref name="AAC98">{{cite journal|date=Jan<U+2013>Mar 1998|title=Josie Petrick Kemarre|journal=Australian Art Collector|issue=3|page=68}}</ref> By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as [[Charles Sturt University]],<ref name="AAC98"/> and in 2005 a work was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].<ref name="NGV"/> Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 ''Landmarks'' exhibition and its catalogue; her painting was printed opposite that of [[Yannima Tommy Watson]], who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the [[Mus<U+00E9>e du quai Branly]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian Indigenous Art Commission: Musee du quai Branly|editor=Claire Armstrong|publisher=Eleonora Triguboff, Art & Australia, and Australia Council for the Arts|date=2006|pages=46<U+2013>50|isbn=0646460455}}</ref><ref name="Newstead"/>

In 2006 a commissioned work by Josie Petrick was exhibited at the [[University of New South Wales]] and sold for [[Australian dollar|AUD]]$22,000, while the record price for her work, set at auction, was $22,800 in May 2007.<ref name="Newstead">{{cite web|url=http://www.aboriginalartcoop.com.au/aboriginal-art/top-200-artists/josie-petrick-kemarre.php|title=Josie Petrick Kemarre c.1953|last=Newstead|first=Adrian|work=Top 200 Australian Aboriginal Artists Special Feature|publisher=Aboriginal Art Coop Gallery|accessdate=5 November 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aboriginalartcoop.com.au%2Faboriginal-art%2Ftop-200-artists%2Fjosie-petrick-kemarre.php&date=2010-11-05|archivedate=5 November 2010}}</ref> A [[triptych]] by Josie Petrick, ''Bush Berries'', was the basis for the cover design of a book on the visual perception of motion, ''Motion Vision''.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Zanker, Johannes M. and Zeil, Jochen|title=Motion vision: computational, neural, and ecological constraints|url=http://www.springer.com/life+sciences/animal+sciences/book/978-3-540-65166-6|accessdate=15 November 2010|year=2001|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=3540651667}}</ref> 

Central Australian artists frequently paint particular '[[dreaming (spirituality)|dreamings]]', or stories, for which they have responsibility or rights.<ref name="JohnsonIntro">{{Cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Aboriginal Artists of the Western Desert: A Biographical Dictionary|chapter=Introduction|publisher=Craftsman House|location=Roseville East, NSW|pages=7<U+2013>12|year=1994|isbn=9768097817}}</ref> The paintings of Josie Petrick portray two different groups of dreamings, rendered in two distinct styles.<ref name="Newstead"/>  Her paintings of [[Carissa spinarum|bush plum]] dreaming are undertaken with red, blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development.<ref name="Mbantua"/> She also paints women<U+2019>s ceremonies (''Awelye'') and dreamings, and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women's ceremonial [[iconography]].<ref name="Newstead"/>
