The main '''campus of [[University of the Philippines at Los Ba<U+00F1>os|University of the Philippines at Los Ba<U+00F1>os (UPLB)]]''' is located in the [[Municipalities of the Philippines|towns]] of [[Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna|Los Ba<U+00F1>os]] and [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Laguna province|Laguna]], some 64 kilometers southeast of [[Manila]]. It comprises of 5,445 hectares (13,450 acres) of land encompassing the entire [[Mount Makiling|Makiling Forest Reserve (MFR)]] and surrounding areas. Meanwhile, its [[land grant]]s, spread in the provinces of Laguna, [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Quezon]], have a combined land area of 9,760 hectares (24,120 acres). The land grants serve as UPLB's research sites and are mostly undeveloped.<ref name='OVCRE'>{{cite web|url = http://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/about-uplb-rde/resources-for-research-extension/9-facilities-equipment-and-library-resources | title = Facilities, Equipment and Library Resources | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Extension | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}</ref>

The [[University of the Philippines|University of the Philippines (UP)]] [[Board of regents|Board of Regents]] initially purchased 72.63 hectares of abandoned farmland in 1909 at the foot of Mount Makiling to serve as the campus of the newly created UP College of Agriculture with students taking part in [[Deforestation|clearing]] the forest area. Classes were first held in tents while practical instruction were done at the [[plantation]]s, such as as [[corn]], [[sugar cane]] and [[tobacco]], in the campus. Expansion followed in February 1918 through [[list of Philippine laws|Act]] 2730 by the [[Philippine Legislature]], which appropriated 379 hectares for the creation of an "Agricultural Experiment Station," and <U+20B1>125,000 (US$2,900)<ref name="conversion"/> that was used by the college to further acquire 261.76 hectares of experimental farms and [[pasture|pasture land]].<ref name='CA history'>{{cite web|url = http://old.uplb.edu.ph/ca/aboutCA/ces/background | title = Historical Background | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os | accessdate = 2011-04-12}}</ref><ref name = '100 Years 0'>{{cite book| pages = 3<U+2013>46 | chapter = Chs. 1<U+2013>3 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/guest4f33786/100-years-chapters-13 | accessdate = 2011-04-11 | date = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Alumni Association, Inc. | location = Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

Although most of the early structures had been demolished during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], some still exist up to this day, including the Palma Bridge and Baker Memorial Hall (both built during [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Bienvenido M. Gonzalez's term from 1927 to 1938). The [[Second World War|war]] destroyed 23 College of Agriculture buildings, 13 student [[dormitory|dormitories]] and [[bungalow]]s, 22 faculty and employee houses and all the student residences. The [[University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os College of Forestry and Natural Resources|School of Forestry]] was likewise devastated.

Grants from [[USAID]] and Mutual Security Agency in the 1950s accelerated the development of the campus with the [[University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Graduate School|Graduate School]] building, the UPCA Library (now [[University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] building) and the Women's Dormitory (now Math Building) built during this period. Meanwhile, grants from the [[United States|US]] Economic Cooperation Agency worth US$239,552, the International Cooperation Administration (ICA) worth US$175,000, and ICA-[[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council]] allowed the construction of the Forest Products Laboratory (believed to to the "largest and best equipped in the [[eastern hemisphere]]" by the time it was constructed) in 1954<ref name='DOST Forest'>{{cite web|url = http://fprdi.dost.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=42&Itemid=67 | title = History | date = 2007-07-01 | accessdate = 2011-04-13 | publisher = Forest Products Research and Development Institute }}</ref>, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute in 1957, and further construction of school and dormitory buildings in the School of Forestry campus in the 1960s, respectively.<ref name="100 Years"/><ref name = '100 Years 2'>{{cite book| pages = 123<U+2013>160 | chapter = Chs. 9<U+2013>10 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-910 | accessdate = 2011-04-11 | date = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Alumni Association, Inc. | location = Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

Aside from international assistance, Five-Year Development Programs in during the terms of [[Dean (education)|Dean]] Domingo Lantican (1958-1971) of the School of Forestry, and Dean [[Dioscoro Umali]] (1959-1970) of the College of Agriculture were also instrumental in developing the campus.

The MFR serves a an outdoor laboratory to students, mostly from the College of Forestry and Natural Resources. Jurisdiction of the MFR, both created in 1910, was originally under the Bureau of Forestry. It was only in 1960 when administration of the MFR was transferred to UP. [[National Power Corporation|NAPOCOR]] acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR, however, in 1987 as part of the [[Philippines]]' [[energy development]] program under [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]].

==Transportation and amenities==

[[Public transportation|Public utility]] [[jeepney]]s are a popular means of transportation around the campus. Since August 2007, a new jeepney route has been under implementation. Jeepney drivers have been since required to post ''kanan'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "right") or ''kaliwa'' ("left"), in reference to their direction. The new route prohibits access to the "middle campus," which contains most of the university's main buildings, to promote walking, and lessen noise and air pollution inside the campus. Being the riding point of many passengers, jeepney drivers calculate a loss of <U+20B1>200-300 (US$5-7)<ref name="conversion"/> and 90% loss of passengers. Due to this, the implementation was met with protest, including a [[Strike action|transport strike]]. Similarly, a [[walkout]] was staged by around 500 students, with students speculating alleged lack of community consultation before its implementation.<ref name='USC letter'>{{Cite web | url = http://www.arkibongbayan.org/2008-02Feb29-UP/doc/uplb%20supports%20transport%20strike.txt | title = Drivers paralyze transport in UPLB; students support transport strike amid continuing protests for GMA ouster | author = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os University Student Council | publisher = Arkibong Bayan | date = 2009-02-26 | accessdate = 2011-04-24}}</ref><ref name = 'transpo2'>{{cite journal | url = http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/270/e/d/UPLB_Perspective_Vol_34_Issue1_by_uplbperspective0708.pdf | title = OVCCA rejects USC, LBCTF appeals: PUJ rerouting <U+2018>dry run<U+2019> continues | author = Rogene Gonzales | page = 10 | journal = UPLB Perspective | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | date = 2007-09-27 | accessdate = 2011-04-24}}</ref> The [[mayor]] of [[Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna|Los Ba<U+00F1>os]] refused to interfere.<ref name='transpo'>{{cite journal | url = http://fc02.deviantart.com/fs20/f/2007/296/5/2/UPLB_Perspective_Vol_34_Issue2_by_uplbperspective0708.pdf | title = Velasco firm on ambulant vending, rerouting issues | author = Angelica Mendoza | author2 = Harriet Melanie Zabala | date = 2007-10-22 | volume= 34 | issue = 2 | journal = UPLB Perspective | accessdate = 2011-04-24 | page = 2}}</ref>
