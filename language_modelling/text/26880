'''HMS ''Aldenham''''' ([[pennant number]] L22) was an [[destroyer escort|escort destroyer]] of the Type III [[Hunt class destroyer|''Hunt''-class]]. The [[Royal Navy]] ordered its construction in July 1940. Upon completion in February 1942, she was deployed to convoy escort duty. ''Aldenham'' is one of the ships credited with the sinking of [[German submarine U-587|German submarine ''U-587'']] on 27 March 1942. After circumnavigating Africa, she joined the [[Mediterranean Fleet]], escorting convoys between [[Alexandria]], Malta and [[Tobruk]]. She took part in the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], landings at [[Salerno landings|Salerno]] and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], the [[Dodecanese Campaign]] and [[Operation Dragoon]] before being assigned to the [[Adriatic Campaign of World War II|Adriatic Campaign]].

On 14 December 1944, ''Aldenham'' was sunk by a [[naval mine]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] off [[Pag (island)|Pag Island]] after she led a Royal Navy force in a [[naval bombardment|bombardment]] mission against targets on the island of Pag and near the town of [[Karlobag]] in support of the [[Yugoslav Partisan]]s. Although the rest of the force came to pick up survivors, cold weather and severe damage to ''Aldenham'' permitted the rescue of only 63 of her crew. Her [[shipwreck|wreck]], broken in two by the explosion, was discovered in 1999&ndash;2000. It is a [[war grave]], where 126 crew members and two Yugoslav Partisans aboard ''Aldenham'' at the time of the mining died. She was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in [[World War II]].

==Design and construction==
HMS ''Aldenham'' (L22) was a [[Royal Navy]] Type III [[Hunt-class destroyer|''Hunt''-class destroyer]]. She had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|85.34|m|ft|abbr=off}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.45|m|ft|abbr=off}} and a maximum [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert/spell |3|m|ft|abbr=off}}. ''Aldenham'' had a standard [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] of {{convert|1015|t|abbr=off}}, and a [[Full-load displacement|full load]] of {{convert|1490|to|1545|t|abbr=off}}. Her two [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove two [[propeller shaft]]. Steam was supplied by two Admiralty three-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at {{convert|13970|kW|shp|lk=in}} and gave ''Aldenham'' a speed of {{convert|28.3|kn|lk=in}} during [[sea trial]]s, but she achieved up to {{convert|27|kn|abbr=off}} on deployments.<ref name=Freivogel66>{{harvnb|Freivogel|2008|p=66}}</ref>

''Aldenham'' was armed with four [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing]] {{convert/spell |4|in|mm|adj=on}} [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|Mk XVI naval gun]]s on twin mounts, four [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] {{convert|40|mm|in|adj=on}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun]]s and three [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon]]s. She also had two {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on}} [[torpedo]] tubes, and 70<U+2013>100 [[depth charge]]s deployed by four throwers and two chutes.<ref name=Freivogel66/>

The ship was ordered on 4 July 1940.<ref name=Friedman331>{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=331}}</ref> She was [[Keel|laid down]] by [[Cammell Laird]] shipyard in [[Birkenhead]] on 22 August 1940 as construction project J 3766. ''Aldenham'' was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 August 1941 and completed on 5 February 1942.<ref name=Freivogel66/>

==Service==
''Aldenham'' and its crew of 170 completed brief training at [[Scapa Flow]] before deploying for the first time on 21 March 1942, as a part of an [[Escort Group]] assigned to the [[List of World War II convoys|WS 17 convoy]] sailing to the [[Cape of Good Hope]].<ref name=Freivogel66/> On 27 March, ''Aldenham'', together with [[USS Twiggs (DD-127)|HMS ''Leamington'']], [[HMS Grove (L77)|HMS ''Grove'']] and [[HMS Volunteer (D71)|HMS ''Volunteer'']], sank [[German submarine U-587|German submarine ''U-587'']] in the [[North Atlantic]], due west of [[Ushant]], [[France]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heden|2006|p=295}}</ref> ''Aldenham'' was commanded by [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Alex Stuart-Menteth.<ref name=Telegraph>{{harvnb|The Telegraph|6 June 2000}}</ref>

Circumnavigating [[Africa]] and transiting the [[Suez Canal]] accompanied by ''Grove'', ''Aldenham'' joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].<ref name=Freivogel6667/> There she performed convoy escort duties, protecting shipping between [[Alexandria]], [[Malta]] and [[Tobruk]].<ref name=Telegraph/> On 29 August 1942, she was assigned coastal bombardment duties,<ref name=Greene122>{{harvnb|Greene|Massignani|2004|p=122}}</ref> including the area of [[RAF El Daba|El Daba]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shrubb|Sainsbury|1979|p=179}}</ref> Sources disagree which ships took part in the bombardment of El Daba itself. According to J<U+00FC>rgen Rohwer, ''Aldenham'' and [[HMS Eridge (L68)|HMS ''Eridge'']] were the only ships involved,<ref>{{harvnb|Rohwer|2005|p=191}}</ref> while Paul Kemp places ''Eridge'' at the scene supported by [[HMS Croome (L62)|HMS ''Croome'']] and [[HMS Hursley (L84)|HMS ''Hursley'']].<ref>{{harvnb|Kemp|1999|p=192}}</ref> ''Aldenham'' towed ''Eridge'' back to Alexandria after the latter ship was disabled by an Italian [[MTSM motor torpedo boat]] during the bombardment.<ref name=Greene122/>

''Aldenham'' was a part of an [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[blockade]] off [[Cap Bon]] in May 1943 and escorted [[landing craft]] during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July and the [[Salerno landings]] in September that year.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Freivogel6667>{{harvnb|Freivogel|2008|pp=66-67}}</ref> She assisted [[HMS Eskimo (F75)|HMS ''Eskimo'']] removing wounded when ''Eskimo'' was attacked and hit by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' on 15 July.<ref>{{harvnb|Tomblin|2004|p=210}}</ref> ''Aldenham'' also took part in failed [[Dodecanese Campaign]] of 1944, when she sustained minor damage in an aircraft attack. After repairs in Alexandria, ''Aldenham'' saw action in [[Operation Shingle]] off [[Anzio]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], and escorted convoys between [[Oran]], [[Algeria]] and [[Naples]]. She was based in [[Taranto]] in May, and transferred to [[Bari]] in June, before supporting [[Operation Dragoon]], protecting landing craft off southern France. Afterwards, she sailed again to the [[Adriatic Sea]], joining a Royal Navy flotilla fighting the [[Adriatic Campaign of World War II|Adriatic Campaign]].<ref name=Freivogel6667/>

The Royal Navy Adriatic flotilla consisted of ''Aldenham'', [[HMS Atherstone (L05)|HMS ''Atherstone'']], [[HMS Avon Vale (L06)|HMS ''Avon Vale'']], [[HMS Lamerton (L88)|HMS ''Lamerton'']], [[HMS Lauderdale (L95)|HMS ''Lauderdale'']], [[HMS Wheatland|HMS ''Wheatland'']], [[HMS Wilton (L128)|HMS ''Wilton'']], [[HMS Brocklesby (L42)|HMS ''Brocklesby'']] and [[HMS Quantock (L58)|HMS ''Quantock'']]. In late November 1944, the flotilla, led by ''Aldenham'' under [[Commander]] James Gerald Farrant, intercepted and captured German [[hospital ship]] ''Bonn'' (ex-[[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[steamship]] ''<U+0160>umadija''). She and ''Atherstone'' [[Naval gunfire support|bombarded]] German units deployed to the island of [[Rab]] on 9 December. The bombardment was in support of [[Yugoslav Partisans]] advance north along the eastern coast of the Adriatic, capturing the coast and islands from retreating German forces.<ref name=Freivogel67>{{harvnb|Freivogel|2008|p=67}}</ref>

What became ''Aldenham''{{'}}s final deployment began on 14 December 1944, when she and ''Atherstone'' sortied from a Royal Navy base at [[Ist (island)|Ist Island]] and anchored off the western coast of [[Pag (island)|Pag Island]], north of [[Zadar]], to bombard an artillery battery near [[Karlobag]] and other military targets on Pag. Because of poor visibility, the [[artillery observer]]s on Pag directed destroyers to strike the Pag Island objectives first. Each destroyer fired 500 {{convert/spell |4|in|mm|adj=on}} shells against bunkers and barracks on the island between 09:00 and 11:20. The town of [[Pag (town)|Pag]] itself was targeted by the destroyers for an hour at 14:00, while ''Aldenham'' alone engaged the battery at Karlobag at approximately 13:00 and again before 15:00 as visibility improved, firing 200 shells against that target. At 15:00, the destroyers started their return to Ist with ''Aldenham'' in the lead and ''Atherstone'' following her at {{convert|20|kn|abbr=off}}.<ref name=Freivogel67/>

==Sinking==
As ''Aldenham'' was making a turn at a position north of the islet of [[<U+0160>krda]], to sail between islands of [[Planik]] and [[Olib]], she hit a [[Naval mine|mine]] that exploded under her [[engine room]]. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by ''Atherton'' and accompanying [[motor launch]]es ''ML 238'' and ''HDML 1162'', and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were pulled out of the sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan [[liaison officer]], [[Colonel]] Ivan Preradovi<U+0107>.<ref name=Freivogel67/> ''Aldenham'' was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in [[World War II]].<ref name=Freivogel66/><ref>{{harvnb|BLF|18 January 2011}}</ref>

A portion of the surviving crew revisited the site on 14 December 1984, but the [[shipwreck]] was not located until 15 years later. In 1999, Italian [[wreck diver]]s located {{convert|30|m|adj=on}} long bow section {{convert/spell |1|nmi|km|abbr=off}} off <U+0160>krda. It lies on port side, at a depth of {{convert|86|m|abbr=off}}, but it is normally obscured by silt stirred up by [[trawling]] further north in the [[Kvarner Gulf]]. The aft section of the ship was discovered in 2000 through testimony of a fisherman from Pag. It was found closer to <U+0160>krda, approximately {{convert|700|m|abbr=off}} away from the bow section. ''Aldenham'''s  boilers and propellers were still operating as sank, and the section struck the silty seafloor at a depth of {{convert|82|m|abbr=off}}, with her keel on top. Her rudder is now at a depth of {{convert|67|m|abbr=off}}. The wreck was declared a British [[war grave]],<ref>{{harvnb|Freivogel|2008|pp=67-68}}</ref> and forms a part  of "the Ghost Fleet of Pag" together with wrecks of ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' destroyer ''TA 20'' (ex-Italian ''Audace''), corvettes ''UJ 202'' and ''UJ 208'' (ex-Italian ''Melp<U+00F3>mene'' and ''Spingarda'') sunk in the [[Action of 1 November 1944]], and [[World War I]] wrecks of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] steamships SS ''Albanien'' and SS ''Euterpe''.<ref>{{harvnb|Freivogel|2008|pp=49<U+2013>50}}</ref>
