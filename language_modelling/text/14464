== History ==

With its origin in the [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown]] machine translation effort, SYSTRAN was one of the few machine translation systems to survive the major decrease of funding after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC Report]] of the mid-1960's.  The company was established in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]], [[California]] to work on translation of Russian to English text for the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Cold War]]. Large numbers of Russian scientific and technical documents were translated using SYSTRAN under the auspices of the USAF Foreign Technology Division (later the National Air and Space Intelligence Center) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio. The quality of the translations, although only approximate, was usually adequate for understanding content.

The company was sold during 1986 to the Gachot family, based in [[Paris]], [[France]], and is now  traded publicly by the French stock exchange.  It has a main office at the [[Grande Arche]] in [[La Defense]] and maintains a secondary office in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California]].
