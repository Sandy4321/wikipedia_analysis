# RNN-LSTM for assessing quality of Wikipedia articles.

This repo contains our implementation of using bidirectional LSTM for automatically assessing the quality of Wikipedia articles.

The solution is validated against English, French and Russian Wikipedia datasets.

One of the most important advantages of this approach compare to handed-feature machine learning approach is that it can be applied to any language without prior knowledge about this language.
