==Plot==
The whole [[Simpson family]] gathers to celebrate [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]'s first birthday. At the party, [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] feels lonely and bored, so [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] suggests she set him up for a date with her mother, [[Jackie_(The_Simpsons)#Jacqueline_Bouvier|Mrs. Bouvier]]. Eventually, the elderly couple falls in love, which upsets [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]; his theory is that if the pair married, he and Marge would be brother and sister and the children would look like freaks. To impress Marge's mother, Grampa takes her out on the town, but when he does, she meets [[Mr. Burns]] and falls for him instead. Grampa is heartbroken. Mr. Burns declares that he is in love with Mrs. Bouvier, and they are going to get married, against Marge's interests. Meanwhile, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] buys a $350 ''[[Itchy & Scratchy]]'' [[animation cel]] with one of Homer's credit cards. In order to pay Homer back, Bart robs $350 from Mr. Burns.

On the day of the wedding, Mr. Burns and Marge's mother attempt to marry. However, Grampa crashes the ceremony and asks that Mrs. Bouvier marry him instead of Mr. Burns. Partly due to Mr. Burns's obnoxious behavior, she declares that she does not want to marry either man, which is good enough for Grampa. He grabs her and they hop on a bus and look anxious about their future.

==Production==
[[File:Bill Oakley2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bill Oakley]] was one of the writers of the episode.]]
"Lady Bouvier's Lover" was written by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], and directed by [[Wes Archer]].<ref name="book"/> The article was inspired because ''The Simpsons'' has many elderly characters, which the writers felt was unique for network television, so they sought to highlight those characters. Originally, the episode was supposed to be about misery. One of the ideas was that Grampa would get injured on Mr. Burns's property and get stuck there, leading Grampa to think that Mr. Burns would kill him when he was discovered there. However, this idea was cut out later in production because the script was over eighty-five pages long.<ref name="Oakley"/>

The episode was recorded at the [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] Building on the [[20th Century Fox]] lot in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]], where the cast and crew of ''The Simpsons'' gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show ([[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], and [[Hank Azaria]]) sat down with executive producer [[David Mirkin]] and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was "genuine hearty laughter at various points" during the script run-through, said [[Ray Richmond]], a reporter for the ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]''. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the "astounding versatility" of the actors became clear; "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to [[Barney Gumble|Barney]] without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities."<ref>{{cite news|title='Simpsons' Actors Voice Their Appreciation|last=Richmond|first=Ray|date=November 14, 1993 |work=Los Angeles Daily News|pages=L4|accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref> Mirkin said the episode was also a [[Tour de Force (expression)|tour de force]] for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with "gravelly voices".<ref name="Mirkin">{{cite video | people=Mirkin, David|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Lady Bouvier's Lover"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson called the episode a "generally good program, though not one of the year<U+2019>s best". Jacobson said he dislikes Marge's mother; "she<U+2019>s one of the series<U+2019> less interesting characters, which is probably why she appears so rarely." However, he thinks Grampa is "always fun", and "it<U+2019>s nice to see him in an ebullient mood, at least for a while."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonfive.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993)  |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin }}</ref> Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict the episode a B&minus; grade and said he is "never terribly interested in episodes that revolve around [Grampa] Simpson". He believes Grampa is "great as a background character, but less so when he takes center stage". He added: "I'm also especially uninterested in episodes revolving around Marge's mother. Having said that, this episode does have a number of inspired moments<U+2014>notably the subplot involving Bart's pursuit of an ''Itchy & Scratchy'' cel, as well as one of the series' many homages to ''The Graduate''."<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2009-01-24 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason5.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Bromley, Patrick }}</ref> Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13784/simpsons-the-complete-fifth-season-the/|title=The Simpsons - The Complete Fifth Season|last=Gibron|first=Bill|date=December 23, 2004|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: "Homer's nightmare vision of Bart, Lisa and Maggie as ordinary kids is a highlight of this especially crazy<U+2014>surreal jokes, flashbacks and dream sequences whizz by at an alarming rate<U+2014>installment."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season5/page21.shtml|title=Lady Bouvier's Lover|accessdate=2008-04-12|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
