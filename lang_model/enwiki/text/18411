The '''Southeastern Conference''' ('''SEC''') is a collegiate [[List of NCAA conferences|athletic conference]] whose member institutions are located primarily in the [[Southern United States|southeastern]] part of the United States.  It is headquartered in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The SEC participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] in athletic competitions; for [[college football|football]], it is part of the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A.  The conference is one of the most successful financially, consistently leading most conferences in revenue distribution to its members, including an SEC record $220.0 million for the 2010<U+2013>11 fiscal year.<ref name="SEC-08Rev">{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/226366/2010-11-sec-revenue-distribution.aspx|title=2010<U+2013>2011 SEC Revenue Distribution |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 6, 2010}}</ref>

The SEC was also the first NCAA Division I conference to hold a championship game (and award a subsequent title) for [[college football]] and was one of the founding members of the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).  The current SEC commissioner is [[Michael Slive]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.secsports.com/new/local/commissioner_070202.html| title=Slive Named Southeastern Conference Commissioner| publisher=SEC| date=July 2, 2002| accessdate=November 5, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  The conference sponsors team championships in nine men's sports and twelve women's sports.

==History==
[[File:SECLocations3.png|400px|right|thumb|Locations of the SEC full-member institutions.]]

===Founding and former members===

The SEC was established on December 8 and 9, 1932, when the thirteen members of the [[Southern Conference]] located west and south of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] left to form their own conference.  Ten of the thirteen founding members have remained in the conference since its inception: the [[University of Alabama]], [[Auburn University]], the [[University of Florida]], the [[University of Georgia]], the [[University of Kentucky]], [[Louisiana State University]] ("LSU"), the [[University of Mississippi]] ("Ole Miss"), [[Mississippi State University]], the [[University of Tennessee]], and [[Vanderbilt University]].

The other charter members were:

*[[Sewanee: The University of the South|The University of the South]] ("Sewanee") left the SEC on December 13, 1940, and later de-emphasized varsity athletics.<ref name="Sewanee1">{{cite news |title=Sewanee quits Southeastern |first=Romney |last=Wheeler |agency=Associated Press |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VuU-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_kwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4638%2C4829781 |publisher=Google News Archives |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |date=December 13, 1940 |page=1 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}</ref> It is currently a member of the [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] [[Southern Athletic Association]].

*[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] ("Georgia Tech") left the SEC in 1964.  In 1975, it became a founding member of the [[Metro Conference]], one of the predecessors to today's [[Conference USA]].  Georgia Tech competed in the Metro Conference in all sports except football, in which it was independent.  In 1978, Georgia Tech joined another Southern Conference offshoot, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], for all sports, where it has remained ever since.

*[[Tulane University]] left the SEC in 1966.  Along with Georgia Tech, it was a charter member of the [[Metro Conference]].  Unlike Tech, however, Tulane remained in the Metro Conference until it merged with the [[Great Midwest Conference]] in 1995 to form Conference USA.  Tulane remained an independent in football until C-USA began football competition in 1996. Tulane will leave C-USA to join the [[American Athletic Conference]] in 2014.

===1990 expansion===
{{Further|Southwest Conference}}

In 1990, the SEC expanded from ten to twelve member universities with the addition of the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] and the [[South Carolina Gamecocks]]. The two new teams began SEC competition with the 1991<U+2013>1992 basketball season.

At the same time, the SEC organized competition for some sports into two divisions.  The Western Division comprised six of the seven member schools in the [[Central Time Zone]], while the Eastern Division comprised the five member schools in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] plus Vanderbilt, which is in the Central Time Zone but was placed in the Eastern Division to preserve its rivalry with Tennessee.  Initially, the divisional format was used in football, baseball, and men's basketball.  The divisional format was dropped for men's basketball following the 2011-2012 season.

Following expansion, the SEC was the first conference to receive permission from the NCAA to sponsor an annual [[SEC Championship Game|football championship game]], featuring the winners of the conference's Eastern and Western divisions.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?change_well_id=9993&s |title=About the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>  The [[1992 SEC Championship Game|1992]] and [[1993 SEC Championship Game|1993]] championship games were held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, and all championship games from [[1994 SEC Championship Game|1994]] onward have been held at the [[Georgia Dome]] in Atlanta.<ref name="about"/>

===2012 expansion===

===Television and radio contracts===

The SEC televises football games across various networks during the fall. SEC coverage is primarily provided by [[CBS]] and the [[ESPN]] family of networks, which includes ESPN, [[ESPN2]], [[ESPNU]] and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].  [[Fox Sports Networks]] also has rights to air seven live football games over the course of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=2&url_subchannel_id=&url_article_id=12865&change_well_id=2 |title=Official Site of the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

ESPN reported paying $2.25 billion for broadcast rights of SEC football games beginning in the 2009 season and running through the fiscal year 2025.<ref>Michael Smith & John Ourand, "[http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/59824  ESPN pays $2.25B for SEC rights]", ''Sports Business Journal'' (August 25, 2008).  Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref>

Games scheduled for airing are generally picked two weeks before they occur, with a few matches that are selected by CBS and ESPN prior to the season.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

CBS has the first pick for a game and selects the highest-profile game to broadcast to a national, over-the-air audience. The CBS game is usually broadcast at 3:30 Eastern. Some weekends, CBS will air a doubleheader of SEC games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/cbssports/schedules/page/collegefootball |title=CBS Sports TV Schedule |publisher=CBSSports.com |date=June 11, 2008 }}</ref> CBS also has the rights for the SEC Championship Game.

ESPN will air several SEC games each week among its various channels, with Saturday time slots generally at 12:00 ET, 7:00 ET, and 7:45 ET, and some SEC games will be shown on Thursday nights.  In previous years, [[Raycom Sports]] (and before it, Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial Sports) syndicated regional coverage for an SEC game of the week at 12:30 ET, but the new contract replaced it with a new ESPN-produced syndication package, the [[SEC Network]]{{emdash}}whose football games kickoff at 12:21 ET.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=2&url_subchannel_id=&url_article_id=12874&change_well_id=2 |title=Official Site of the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

The currently scheduled Fox Sports Net games are set for 7:00 ET.<ref name="secsports.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?url_article_id=5905&change_well_id=2 |title=Official Site of the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

For games not selected by any broadcast provider, certain schools may offer regional pay-per-view.

As of 2008, all SEC schools are affiliated with XM Radio, offering their radio broadcasts to an audience on XM.  According to SiriusXM, the SEC will not be included as part of the "Best of XM" package deal for Sirius customers.

====2008 television contract====
During the 2007<U+2013>2008 fiscal year review meeting, there was discussion among SEC leadership about the possibility of starting a TV network dedicated to its conference, much in the same way the [[Mountain West Conference]] and [[Big Ten Conference]] have done with [[MountainWest Sports Network|the mtn.]] and [[Big Ten Network]]s, respectively.  A decision was made to postpone the decision until at least the following year.<ref>[http://www.tidesports.com/article/20080531/NEWS/733342667/1011/news&tc=yahoo SEC considering starting own TV network | TideSports.com]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>

In August 2008, the SEC announced an unprecedented 15-year television contract with CBS worth an estimated $55 million a year.  This continues the relationship the SEC already has with CBS, which puts the SEC in the unique position as the only conference to have its own exclusive national television network of the four major over-the-air broadcast networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox) to display the SEC's events.<ref name="about"/>

In the same month, the league also announced another landmark television contract with ESPN worth $2.25 billion or $150 million a year for the life of the contract, which is for fifteen years.  It is the longest and wealthiest contract among all television deals among the major conferences.  With these contracts, the SEC had, at the time of the deal, the richest television deals in the country outside the Big Ten and helped make the SEC one of the most nationally televised and visible conferences in the country with the coverage that was provided by these contracts.<ref>http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080826/SPORTS/808260339</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://secsports.com/index.php?s=&url_channel_id=3&url_article_id=11428&change_well_id=2 |title=Official Site of the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

====2014 SEC Network Launch====
{{Main|SEC Network (television network)}}

[[File:SEC Network logo.jpg|200px|thumbnail|The SEC Network's official logo]]
The [[SEC Network (television network)|SEC Network]]  is a [[television]] and multimedia network that will feature exclusively Southeastern Conference content through a partnership between [[ESPN]] and the SEC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/244762/sec-and-espn-announce-new-tv-network.aspx |title=SEC And ESPN Announce New TV Network > SEC > NEWS |publisher=Secdigitalnetwork.com |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref> The new network is scheduled to launch on August 21, 2014 with the first football game scheduled for a week later between Texas A&M and South Carolina on Thursday, August 28 in Columbia, S.C. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/246413/sec-releases-2014-conference-football-schedule.aspx |title=SEC Releases 2014 Conference Football Schedule > SEC > NEWS |publisher=Secdigitalnetwork.com |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>

The network is part of a deal between the Southeastern Conference and ESPN which was a 20-year agreement, beginning in August of 2014 and running through 2034. The agreement served to create and operate a new multiplatform television network and accompanying digital platform in the hope of increasing revenue for member institutions and expanding the reach of the Southeastern Conference.

Adams]] (pictures right) was President of the [[University of Georgia]] and chair SEC Presidents and Chancellors during the formation of SECU.]]
Under the leadership of [[Michael F. Adams]] the then President of the [[University of Georgia]] and chair of SEC Presidents and Chancellors, the member institutions of the Southeastern Conference joined forces in 2005 to form the SEC Academic Consortium (SECAC), a collaborative endeavor designed to promote research, scholarship and achievement amongst the universities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southeastern Conference Creates Consortium to Strengthen Academic Programs at SEC Institutions|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/SECAC_created.pdf|publisher=SEC Digital Network|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, the SEC Academic Consortium was relocated to the SEC headquarters in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], from its original home on the campus of the [[University of Arkansas]] in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]] and was renamed SECU. The SECU rebranded its mission to better serve as a means through which the collaborative academic endeavors and achievements of Southeastern Conference universities would be promoted and advanced. The SECU's goals included highlighting the endeavors and achievements of SEC [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], students and its universities; advancing the academic reputation of SEC universities; identifying and preparing future leaders for high-level service in [[academia]]; increasing the amount and type of [[study abroad]] opportunities available for students; and providing opportunities for collaboration among SEC university personnel.<ref>{{cite web|title=SECU|url=http://www.secsymposium.com/secu.php|publisher=SEC|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SECU: The Academic Initiative of the SEC|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/AcademicConsortium|publisher=SEC Digital Network|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref> The [[Big Ten Conference]] has a similar program called the [[Committee on Institutional Cooperation]].

The SEC Academic Network was created in 2009 in partnership with [[ESPN]]. The SEC Academic Network was an online library of institutionally produced videos featuring academic initiatives and stories from all Southeastern Conference institutions. The SEC Academic Network was officially merged into the SECU operation.<ref>{{cite web|title=About SECU|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/secac_sec_fact_sheet.pdf|publisher=SEC Digital Network|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

===SECU academic programs===

There are several programs that have been implemented under SECU.<ref>{{cite web|title=SECU Programs|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/SECU%20Programs%20and%20Activities%20List.pdf|publisher=SECNetwork|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

The '''SEC Academic Leadership Development Program''' seeks to identify, prepare and advance academic leaders for roles within SEC institutions and beyond. It has two components, a university-level program and two, three-day, SEC-wide workshops held on specified campuses for all participants.

The '''SEC Faculty Achievement and Professor of the Year Awards''' recognize faculty with outstanding records in research and scholarship. There is one winner per campus and one overall winner for the Conference.

[[File:Southeastern Conference Academic Consortium.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|The old site housing the headquarters of the Southeastern Conference Academic Consortium in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas]].]]
The '''SEC Faculty Travel Grant Program''' is intended to enhance collaboration that stimulates scholarly initiatives between SEC universities. The program offers faculty from each SEC university the opportunity to travel to other SEC universities to develop grant proposals and conduct research.

The '''SEC College Tour''' occurs each spring, and administrators from all SEC universities participate in events intended to introduce SEC universities to students, parents and high school counselors from outside of the Southeast region.

The '''SEC Symposium''' is an academic conference-type event intended to address a scholarly issue in an area of strength represented by all SEC universities. Held in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], this marquee event puts on display the research and innovation of SEC institutions for an audience of academicians, government officials, grant funding agents and other stakeholders.

In 2013, the SEC Symposium was organized and led by the [[University of Georgia]] and the [[University of Georgia#UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute|UGA Bioenergy Systems Research Institute]]. The topic of the Symposium was titled, the "Impact of the Southeast in the World's Renewable Energy Future".<ref>{{cite web|title=SEC Symposium to address role of Southeast in renewable energy|url=http://news.uga.edu/releases/article/sec-symposium-to-address-role-of-southeast-in-renewable-energy/|publisher=University of Georgia|accessdate=13 February 2013}}</ref>

The '''SEC Cooperative Education Abroad Agreement''' provides opportunities for students from all SEC universities to access international programs offered at other SEC universities. And as part of a renewable agreement, Italian engineering students from the Politecnico di Torino (PdT) have the opportunity to enroll at SEC universities each fall, and engineering SEC students may study there the following spring.

The '''SEC MBA Case Competition''' are graduate level competitions provide an opportunity for SEC business schools to showcase their students<U+2019> skills at solving simulated, real-world problems that cover the spectrum of business disciplines (e.g., organizational dynamics, budgeting, capitalization, competitive environment, etc.). The competition is held on one SEC campus and teams of four MBA students compete against other SEC teams, the best receiving various awards and recognition. The event is generally in April.

The '''SEC University Collaboration Program''' gives university personnel groups (e.g., deans of colleges, chief financial officers, etc.) a mechanism to share best practices and ideas. Regular meetings and workshops are held university campuses, the Conference office or other similar locations.

The '''International/Education Abroad Activities program''' was established as a part of a renewable agreement, Italian engineering students enroll at SEC universities each fall, and engineering SEC students study in Italy each spring
(i.e., February to July) at the [[Politecnico di Torino]]. In addition, by utilizing a cooperative programming agreement, students from all SEC universities have access to education abroad programs offered at other SEC universities.

==Member universities==

===Current members===

The SEC has fourteen member institutions in eleven contiguous states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=9998 |title=SEC Members |publisher=secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>  The geographic domain of the conference stretches from Texas to South Carolina (west to east) and from Missouri to Florida (north to south).

The SEC is divided into two geographic divisions: the Eastern Division and the Western Division.  These division groupings are currently used only in football and baseball scheduling and standings.  Starting with the 2011<U+2013>12 season, the SEC abandoned its previous divisional alignment in men's basketball, following a vote by SEC head coaches on June 1, 2011 at the conference's annual meeting.<ref name="MBB changes">{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/SECNation/SECTraditions/tabid/1073/Article/226326/destin-recap-day-two.aspx |title=Destin Recap: Day Two |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}</ref>  This change makes the SEC more consistent with other conferences, since none of the other five "BCS conferences" use divisions in basketball even if they are used in football, baseball or other sports.  Effective July 1, 2012, the fourteen members of the SEC are:

[[File:AmericanFootball current event.svg|40px|alt=|link=2013 Southeastern Conference football season]] ''For the upcoming season, see [[2013 Southeastern Conference football season]]''

Before the 1991 expansion, each SEC school played seven conference games. Five of these games were against permanent opponents, developing some traditional rivalries between schools, and the other games rotated around the other four members of the conference.

The SEC went to an eight game conference schedule starting in 1992, with each team playing the five other teams in their division and three opponents from the other division. The winners of the two divisions would then meet in the [[SEC Championship Game]].

From 1992 through 2001, each team had two permanent inter-divisional opponents, allowing many traditional rivalries from the pre-expansion era (such as Florida vs. Auburn, Kentucky vs. LSU and Vanderbilt vs. Alabama) to continue.  However, complaints from some league athletic directors about imbalance in the schedule (for instance, Auburn's two permanent opponents from the East were Florida and Georgia <U+2013> two of the SEC's stronger football programs at the time <U+2013> while Mississippi State played Kentucky and South Carolina every year) led to the SEC reducing the permanent inter-division opponents to only one per team starting in the 2002 season.

Under the current format, each school plays a total of eight conference games, consisting of the other six teams in its division, one school from the other division on a rotating basis, and one school from the other division that it plays each year.  All permanent inter-divisional games, with the exception of Arkansas vs. South Carolina, were played annually before SEC expansion in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&change_well_id=2&url_article_id=317 |title=SEC Football Scheduling Format |publisher=secsports.com }}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

Starting in 2014, Arkansas and Missouri will become permanent inter-division opponents, with Texas A&M and South Carolina becoming permanent rivals.<ref>Dave Matter, "[http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2012/oct/18/2013-missouri-football-plays-ole-miss-not-arkansas/?tigerextra  In 2013, Missouri football plays Ole Miss, not Arkansas]," ''Columbia Tribune'' (October 18, 2012).  Retrieved October 26, 2012.</ref>

Some league athletic directors have advocated discarding the current scheduling format and adopting the one used for divisional play by the [[Big 12 Conference]] through 2010, where teams play three teams from the opposite division on a home-and-home basis for two seasons and then switch and play the other three teams from the opposite side for a two-year home-and-home. However, the potential loss of such heated (and profitable, as the games are often shown on national TV) long-standing rivalries as [[Deep South's Oldest Rivalry|Auburn-Georgia]], [[Third Saturday in October|Alabama-Tennessee]], and [[Florida<U+2013>LSU football rivalry|Florida<U+2013>LSU]] have scuttled such plans on the drawing board. The loss of the annual rivalry between [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] had led some Big 12 athletic directors to make a push to adopt the SEC format for the Big 12 prior to [[2010<U+2013>13 Big 12 Conference realignment|the loss of Colorado and Nebraska]] following the 2010 season. The [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] followed the SEC's lead and went one step further, adopting the permanent rival format for both football and basketball (in the latter sport each school had two designated rivals until expansion to 14 schools rendered that arrangement impractical). The [[Big Ten Conference]], which [[2010<U+2013>13 Big Ten Conference realignment|added Nebraska in 2011]], is also following the SEC's lead in its scheduling format.

{{Main|SEC Championship Game}}

The [[SEC Championship Game]] pits the SEC Western Division representative against the Eastern Division representative in a game held after the regular season has been completed.  The first two SEC Championship football games were held at [[Legion Field]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  Since 1994, the game has been played at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta]].  The team designated as the "home" team alternates between division champions; the designation goes to the Eastern champion in even-numbered years and the Western champion in odd-numbered years.  As of 2012, the Eastern division of the SEC narrowly leads the Western division in overall wins in the championship game [[SEC Championship Game#Results|11 to 10]].

===Bowl selection procedures===
If the SEC champion is selected to participate in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], the Sugar Bowl is not required to pick the SEC runner-up but may select any eligible BCS team.  However, since 2006, the Sugar Bowl has selected either a division runner-up (2006 LSU, 2007 Georgia, 2010 Arkansas, and 2012 Florida) or conference runner-up (2008 Alabama, 2009 Florida), which has been the second highest ranked SEC team in the BCS standings.  The Sugar Bowl was unable to select an SEC team in 2011, since two conference teams, LSU and Alabama, were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the final BCS standings, and thus committed to the BCS National Championship Game (which was coincidentally scheduled for New Orleans). Under BCS rules, no conference may have more than two schools play in BCS games, a provision which kept No. 5 Arkansas out of the more lucrative contests and relegated the Razorbacks to the Cotton Bowl, where they defeated #8 Kansas State. With the SEC off-limits, the January 2012 Sugar Bowl matched Big Ten at-large Michigan and ACC at-large Virginia Tech. 

Under SEC guidelines, unless the Sugar Bowl selects the SEC runner-up, the Capital One Bowl must then pick the SEC runner-up if that team has at least two more total wins than the next team in the selection order. 2012 runner-up Georgia was the first such team to play in the Capital One Bowl since Arkansas following the 2006 season.

After those selections, the Outback Bowl and the Cotton Bowl Classic have the next choices.  Due to geographical considerations, the Outback Bowl has the first choice of the remaining teams in the SEC East, while the Cotton Bowl Classic has the first choice of those left in the SEC West.

The Chick-fil-A Bowl, Gator Bowl and Music City Bowl then have the next three picks.

The Liberty Bowl and BBVA Compass Bowl work together, along with the SEC office, to determine the bowls' picks.

The Independence Bowl picks last.  In the case that the SEC does not have enough bowl-eligible teams, another bowl eligible team will be selected instead.

The SEC is presently second in BCS Bowl appearances, with twenty-one appearances, and first in all-time wins and winning percentage, with fifteen wins and a .714 winning percentage.  The BCS Bowls include the Rose, Sugar, Orange, Fiesta, and the BCS National Championship Game.

Since the advent of the BCS National Championship Game format, the SEC is 9<U+2013>1 in those games.  The one SEC loss, however, was at the hands of another SEC team when the conference sent an unprecedented two teams to the 2012 National Championship game.  The SEC was 2<U+2013>0 in the games where the BCS National Championship Game was played as one of the traditional New Year's Day bowls, and since 2007 (when the game was moved to a separate contest one week later) an SEC team has participated in all seven games and has won all seven. Interestingly, in games that involved only one SEC school, the SEC team was ranked No. 1 only three times going into the game (the first contest featuring Tennessee in 1998, followed by Alabama in 2009 and Auburn in 2010); the other five times the SEC team (LSU twice, Florida twice, and Alabama once) was ranked No. 2. In the 2012 championship game, second-ranked Alabama defeated top-ranked LSU. The SEC's last loss to outside competition in a national championship game was Tennessee's setback vs. Nebraska in the Orange Bowl following the 1997 season, the last before the BCS.

==Men's basketball==
[[File:Basketball current event.svg|40px|alt=|link=2012<U+2013>13 Southeastern Conference men's basketball season]] ''For the most recently completed season, see [[2012<U+2013>13 Southeastern Conference men's basketball season]].''

As of the 2012<U+2013>13 season, SEC teams play an 18-game conference schedule. Before expansion to 14 teams, the conference schedule was 16 games. Although the divisions were eliminated beginning with the 2011<U+2013>12 season, that season's schedule was still set according to the divisional alignments, with each team facing each team from its own division twice and each team from the opposite division once. As part of the proposal by SEC head coaches that led to the scrapping of the divisional structure, a task force of four coaches and four athletic directors was set to discuss future conference scheduling. At that time, options included a revamped 16-game schedule, an 18-game schedule, or a full double round-robin of 22 conference games.<ref name="MBB changes"/>  However, these discussions came before Texas A&M and Missouri were announced in late 2011 as incoming members for the 2012<U+2013>13 season.

At the 2012 SEC spring meetings, league athletic directors adopted an 18-game conference schedule. Each school will have one permanent opponent they will play home and away every season, and each school will face four other opponents in a home-and-home series during a given season, and then the remaining teams one each (four home, four away). The permanent opponents are Alabama-Auburn, Arkansas-Missouri, Florida-Kentucky, Georgia-South Carolina, LSU-Texas A&M, Ole Miss-Mississippi State and Tennessee-Vanderbilt. The home-and-home opponents, apart from the permanent opponent, will rotate each season.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/235185/sec-mens-basketball-scheduletournament-formats.aspx |title=SEC Men's Basketball Schedule/Tournament Formats |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref>

Before the 1991 expansion to 12 schools, teams played a double round-robin, leading to an exhausting 18-game conference schedule. Not surprisingly, no team ever ran the table when the conference schedule featured 18 games; three teams went 17<U+2013>1 (Kentucky in 1970 and 1986, LSU in 1981). During the period from 1992 to 2012 when the league slate was 16 games, Kentucky went undefeated in SEC play in 1996, 2003 and 2012 (although only the 2003 team went on to win the conference tournament).

The new SEC coordinator of basketball officials for 2013-14 was announced as Dr. Robert "Jake" Bell. Bell is a former SEC and NCAA tournament official. He lives in Lexington, KY.<ref>{{cite web|author=By Staff, Special Reports |url=http://www.kentucky.com/2013/06/11/2674075/lexingtonian-bell-new-sec-coordinator.html |title=Lexington's Jake Bell named new SEC coordinator of men's basketball officials &#124; College Basketball |publisher=Kentucky.com |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}</ref>

===Basketball tournament===
{{Main|SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|}}
The ''[[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]]'' (sometimes known simply as the ''[[SEC Tournament]]'') is the competition that determines the SEC's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA men's basketball tournament]]. Notably, it does not determine the SEC conference champion in men's basketball<U+2014>the conference has awarded its championship to the team(s) with the best regular-season record since the 1950<U+2013>51 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/menshoops/SECMBBGuide.pdf |title=Through the Years: SEC Champions |work=2012<U+2013>13 SEC Men's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=Southeastern Conference |format=PDF |page=67 |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |quote=Since 1951, when the round-robin schedule was introduced, the title has been decided by a winning percentage on the conference schedule.}}</ref> It is a single-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records.

With the expansion to 14 members in 2012, the 2013 tournament was the first with a new format covering five days. The teams seeded 11 through 14 play on the first day, with the winners advancing to play the No. 5 and 6 seeds on Thursday. The top four teams receive a "double bye" and do not play until the quarterfinals on Friday.

The tournament is most often held at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], though sometimes takes place at the [[New Orleans Arena]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], [[Bridgestone Arena]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] or the [[Tampa Bay Times Forum]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].

Prior to moving to the Georgia Dome, the tournament was most often contested at the [[Birmingham-Jefferson Convention Complex|Birmingham-Jefferson Civic Center]], home of the SEC's headquarters and centrally located prior to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina. Other sites to host include on-campus arenas at LSU, Tennessee and Vanderbilt; [[Rupp Arena]] in Lexington; and the [[Amway Arena|Orlando Arena]].

===Awards===
The [[SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year]] is awarded to the player who has proven himself, throughout the season, to be the most exceptional talent in the Southeastern Conference. Various other awards, such as the best tournament player in the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament]] and all conference honors are given out throughout the year.

==Baseball==
{{See also|SEC Baseball Tournament}}

Schools play a 30-game league schedule (10 three-game series). From 1996 through 2012, schools played all five schools within their division and five of the six schools from the opposite division. With the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M, schools will now miss three opponents from the opposite division in a given season.

Since 1990, the SEC has become the most successful conference on the college baseball diamond. That year, Georgia captured the conference's first national championship at the [[College World Series]]. Following that, LSU won 6 of the next 19 titles, including 5 of 10 between 1991 and 2000 and its sixth title in 2009. This was followed by South Carolina winning back to back titles in 2010 and 2011. During that same span, 5 teams have also been runner ups at the CWS. In 1997 and 2011 both of the two final teams in the CWS have been from the SEC. The only SEC member that has never appeared in the CWS is [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Kentucky]].

SEC teams have also become leaders in total and average attendance over the years. In 2010 five of the top six drawing programs hailed from the SEC. Six more teams placed in the top 35 nationally.

The NCAA automatic berth is given to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, which was first started in 1977. It is a double-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. Since 1998, the tournament has been held at [[Regions Park]] in [[Hoover, Alabama]] and contested under the format used at the [[College World Series]] from 1988 through 2002, with two four-team brackets leading to a single championship game. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]].

SEC presidents and athletic directors voted to expand the SEC Tournament to 10 teams starting in 2012. The division winners will receive a bye on the first day of competition, and the tournament will become single-elimination after the field is pared to four teams.

In addition to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, the Southeastern Conference usually gets several at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams have qualified for the NCAA Tournament despite failing to qualify for the SEC Tournament. One of those, Mississippi State, reached the College World Series in 2007.

===Rivalries===
Several baseball rivalries have developed in the SEC:
*[[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]-[[Tulane Green Wave|Tulane]]
:Historically these schools are arch-rivals, but following Tulane's decades long deemphasis of sports, including its exit from the SEC in 1966, this is the only sport in which the two schools are more evenly matched. On several occasions matchups between the two have drawn national record-setting attendances. Tulane reached its first [[College World Series]] in 2001 by defeating LSU in three games in the super regional at [[Zephyr Field]]. In 2002, the Tigers and Green Wave drew an NCAA regular season record crowd of 27,673 to the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome|Louisiana Superdome]].
*[[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]-[[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State]]
:Before the arrival of [[Skip Bertman]] as LSU's baseball coach in 1984, Mississippi State had long dominated the conference in baseball, with most of that success coming under legendary coach [[Ron Polk]] (who returned to coach the Bulldogs in 2002 after retiring following the 1997 season), who coached future MLB stars such as [[Rafael Palmeiro]], [[Will Clark]] and [[Jeff Brantley]]. But when Bertman arrived in Baton Rouge, LSU's long-dormant program took off, winning 11 SEC championships and five [[College World Series]] championships in 18 seasons from 1984 through 2001.
*[[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]-[[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]]
:This instate rivalry has long been an intense local affair, with the Gamecocks and Tigers meeting each regular season. It has intensified over recent years and gained national prominence as both teams are often ranked in the top 10 nationally. The two highlights of the rivalry have been the [[2002 College World Series|2002]] and [[2010 College World Series|2010]] meetings in the final four of the [[College World Series]]. Each time, South Carolina emerged from the losers bracket to beat Clemson twice and advance to the National Championship match-up, winning the title in 2010. The Gamecocks defeated the Tigers twice by one run in the 2012 Columbia regional.
*[[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]-[[North Carolina Tar Heels baseball|North Carolina]]
:To say that the two teams are familiar with each other would be an understatement as the [[Gamecocks]] and [[Tar Heels]] have met in the NCAA tournament five times between 2002 and 2013. The [[2002 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2002 NCAA Regional]], [[2003 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2003 NCAA Super Regional]], [[2004 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2004 NCAA Regional]] and [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2013 NCAA Regional]] featured both schools against each other. [[South Carolina]] took two of three games over the [[Tar Heels]] to advance in the postseason in 2002, won both games in 2003 to reach the [[College World Series]] and won a pair of games in 2004 to go on to another Super Regional. In 2007 and 2013, the Tar Heels took both series in Chapel Hill, two games to one, to advance to the College World Series. South Carolina baseball coach [[Ray Tanner]] had an even longer history with the Tar Heels, having coached [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] rival [[North Carolina State Wolfpack|North Carolina State]] for nine seasons (1988<U+2013>96) before leaving for Columbia. Current South Carolina coach Chad Holbrook played and coached under UNC's Mike Fox for 15 seasons before joining the Gamecock staff under Tanner and later being named the Gamecocks' head coach.

==Women's basketball==
The SEC has historically been the most dominant conference in women's basketball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/news/2000/11/17/sec_one/ |title=As Strong As Ever |last=Traub |first=Seth |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=November 17, 2000 |publisher=CNNSI.com}}</ref> Since the 2009<U+2013>10 season, teams have played a 16-game conference schedule with a single league table; prior to that time the conference schedule was 14 games, again in a single table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=5083 |title=SEC women's schedule affects seedings for tournament |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=March 3, 2010 |work=The Starkville Dispatch |last=Minichino |first=Adam}}</ref> Like SEC men's basketball, women's basketball used the divisional alignment for scheduling purposes through the 2011<U+2013>12 season; however, the women's scheduling format was significantly different from the men's. Each team played home-and-home games against five schools<U+2014>one permanent opponent, two teams from the same division, and two teams from the opposite division; the non-permanent home-and-home opponents rotated every two years.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.ukathletics.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/082409aaa.html |title=UK Hoops Announces 2009<U+2013>10 Schedule |publisher=[[Kentucky Wildcats|University of Kentucky Athletics]] |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 16, 2011 |quote=The system increased the existing 14-game schedule by adding an additional rotating team from the East and West divisions.  Kentucky's permanent partner is South Carolina and for the next two seasons, UK will face Auburn and Arkansas as their Western home-and-home opponent (''sic''). The Wildcats' Eastern Division partners are Georgia and Vanderbilt.}}</ref> The remaining games were single games against the six other schools in the conference, with three at home and three away.

The league voted to keep a 16-game league schedule even after the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M. Arkansas and LSU are no longer permanent opponents, with the Lady'Backs picking up Missouri and the Lady Tigers picking up Texas A&M. The other permanent opponents are the same as men's basketball, except for Florida-Georgia and Kentucky-South Carolina (both pairs had been permanent women's basketball opponents before the 2012 expansion). Each school plays two others home-and-home during a given season and the other 10 once each. The divisional alignments no longer play any role in scheduling.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/235149/sec-spring-meetings-notes.aspx |title=SEC Spring Meetings Notes |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref>

The recent history of SEC women's basketball is dominated by [[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]], who have won regular season and/or conference tournament championships in 20 of the last 22 seasons, as well as 8 national championships since 1987. In the 28 seasons the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]] has been held, SEC schools have reached the Final Four 32 times, more than twice as often as any other conference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/the_sec/default.aspx |title=The SEC |publisher=Southeastern Conference |accessdate=March 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>

===Basketball tournament===
{{Main|SEC Women's Basketball Tournament|}}
The ''[[SEC Women's Basketball Tournament]]'' is currently held a week before the men's basketball tournament. Like the men's version, it is a single-elimination tournament involving all conference members, with seeding based on regular season records. With the expansion to 14 schools, the bottom four teams in the conference standings play opening-round games, and the top four receive "double byes" into the quarterfinals. The winner earns the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA women's basketball tournament]]. Also paralleling the men's tournament, the women's tournament does not determine the SEC champion; that honor has been awarded based on regular-season record since the 1985<U+2013>86 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/wbasketball/2012-13_sec_wbb_guide.pdf |title=Championships: SEC Champions |work=2012<U+2013>13 SEC Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=Southeastern Conference |format=PDF |page=88 |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |quote=From 1980 to 1985, the SEC champion was the winner of the SEC Tournament. Since 1986, the SEC champion has been determined by the regular season schedule.}}</ref>

The tournament, inaugurated in 1980, was originally held on campus sites; the first tournament to take place at a neutral site was in 1987. The two most frequent sites for the tournament have been [[McKenzie Arena]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (seven times) and the [[Albany Civic Center]] in [[Albany, Georgia]] (six times); however, the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 and Chattanooga in 2000. Because demand for women's tournament tickets is generally lower than for the men's tournament, it is typically played in a smaller venue than the men's tournament in the same season. The most frequent venues in recent years have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, [[Verizon Arena]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]], and the [[Arena at Gwinnett Center]] in [[Duluth, Georgia]]. Since 2000, Bridgestone Arena has hosted the event five times, with the other two venues doing so three times each.

===Rivalries===

*[[Tennessee Lady Volunteers basketball|Tennessee]]-[[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|UConn]]
{{See also|Tennessee-UConn rivalry}}
:The Lady Vols have historically been the nation's dominant program in that sport. Starting in the mid-1990s, UConn has emerged as Tennessee's main rival for national prominence. The Huskies won four national titles between 2000 and 2004; in three of those years, their victim in the NCAA final was Tennessee. Connecticut also defeated Tennessee in the 1995 Championship game, the Huskies' first-ever title.

==Other sports==
Besides football, basketball, and baseball, there are a number of other sports in which the Southeastern Conference actively competes.

===Rivalries===
*[[Alabama Crimson Tide gymnastics|Alabama]]-[[Georgia Gym Dogs|Georgia]], women's gymnastics
:These two storied programs have often butted heads for not only SEC titles, but NCAA titles, as well. Georgia has won ten national championships to Alabama's six.  For decades the rivalry was dominated by the two long standing coaches of the two schools, [[Suzanne Yoculan]] of Georgia and [[Sarah Patterson (coach)|Sarah Patterson]] of Alabama.  Yoculan has since retired bringing their personal rivalry to an end.
*[[University of Alabama athletics|Alabama]]-[[University of Florida|Florida]], women's softball
:These two nationally acclaimed softball programs have proven to be the elite of the SEC and the nation.  While consistently being ranked in the nation's Top Ten, both teams find their way to the SEC Tournament Finals and often clash once more in the Women's College Softball World Series.
*[[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn]]-[[Texas Longhorns|Texas]], men's swimming and diving
:One of the youngest rivalries featuring an SEC team, the Tigers and Texas Longhorns are the two most successful swimming and diving programs in the country. The two have combined for 17 NCAA National Titles since 1981 (9 for Texas, 8 for Auburn) and between 1999 and 2007 won every national title awarded. The two regularly face off in a meet during the regular season, Auburn's men own an 12<U+2013>9 record over the Longhorns. The women just recently began an annual series, with the Tigers winning the series so far 3<U+2013>1.  Texas was the only team to beat the Auburn men between 2001 and 2007.<ref name="Texas">{{cite web|url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/011107aaa.html |title= Auburn Men's Swimming And Diving Falls To No. 1 Texas, Snapping 44-Dual Meet Win Streak |publisher= Auburn University Athletics |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}</ref>

==National team championships==

{{Main|List of SEC national champions}}

Since the SEC's founding in December 1932, the varsity athletic teams of its current 14 members have won over 200 national team sports championships.

The following is the list of the national team championships claimed by current SEC member schools, including those tournament championships currently or formerly sponsored by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).<ref name="ncaa mens titles">{{cite web | title = NCAA Men's Championships  | url =http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/Men.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =June 3, 2009}}</ref><ref name="ncaa womens titles">{{cite web | title = NCAA Women's Championships | url =http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/Women.pdf | format =PDF | accessdate =June 3, 2009}}</ref>  The NCAA has never sponsored a tournament championship for major college football, the championship game for which is currently sponsored and operated by the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).  Prior to 1992, championships for major college football were determined by a "consensus" of major polling services, including the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] college football polls.  Recognized [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women championships|women's championships]] from 1972 to 1982 were administered by the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW), not the NCAA.  There was a one-year overlap period during the 1981<U+2013>82 school year, when both the AIAW and the NCAA operated women's championship tournaments; since 1982, only the NCAA has sponsored women's championship tournaments.  National equestrian tournament championships are currently sponsored by the [[National Collegiate Equestrian Association]] (NCEA), not the NCAA.  Those national championships dating from before 1933 predate the founding of the SEC in December 1932; championships won by Arkansas and South Carolina before the 1992<U+2013>93 school year predate their membership in the SEC; championships won by Missouri and Texas A&M before the 2012<U+2013>13 school year predate their membership in the SEC.

*{{note|j}}J.&nbsp;Series was annual rivalry when Arkansas and Texas A&M were both in the [[Southwest Conference]]. The teams began playing annually at [[Cowboys Stadium]] starting in 2009; beginning in 2012 the series will become a conference matchup and will revert to a home-and-home for 2012 and 2013, then return to Cowboys Stadium in 2014.
*{{note|k}}K.&nbsp;The series doesn't have an official nickname (the unofficial nickname is due to both teams sharing the same mascot name), but due to the close margin most years, some individual games do. Not an annual rivalry until Auburn and LSU were placed in SEC West division in 1992.
*{{note|l}}L.&nbsp;Series has only been played twice in regular season since 1987.
*{{note|m}}M.&nbsp;Played in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. The rotates every year depending on which team is the designated home team. Also known as the "World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party" though use of the term is discouraged due to the issue of underage alcohol use.
*{{note|n}}N.&nbsp;For decades the trophy of this game was a red, white, and blue [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] barrel, but this practice was discontinued in 1999 following a DUI accident that killed two Kentucky football players.
*{{note|o}}O.&nbsp;Whereabouts of the original rag are unknown; a new rag was presented to LSU after victories in 2001 and 2006. Series was only contested twice from 1995 through 2005, but a 10-year contract began in 2006.
*{{note|p}}P.&nbsp;Since joining the SEC this game has been played on or around Halloween every year, accordingly many students dress in costume for this game. The contrasting team colors are also typical Halloween colors.
*{{note|q}}Q.&nbsp;For 74&nbsp;years the trophy of this game was the Beer Barrel: an orange, white, and blue beer keg. However, this practice was discontinued in 1999 following the aforementioned DUI accident.
