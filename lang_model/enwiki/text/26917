In [[gridiron football]], '''roughing the kicker''' is an action in which a defender, having missed an attempt to block a kick, tackles the kicker or otherwise runs into the kicker in a way that might injure the kicker or his vulnerable extended kicking leg. This protection is also extended to the holder of a place kick. It is a separate penalty from '''"[[running into the kicker]]."'''<ref name=nelson520>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=David|title=The anatomy of a game: football, the rules, and the men who made the game |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OmwfnipKuogC&pg=PA476&dq=%22Roughing+the+kicker+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TdgJT4GwKMro0QGm6tyfAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Roughing%20the%20kicker%20%22&f=false|page=520}}</ref>

The penalty for such a violation in most leagues is 15 yards and an automatic first down. When such a violation occurs, the team about to surrender possession via a [[punt]] will retain its possession as a result. If the violation occurs when a successful field goal is kicked, the yardage is assessed on the ensuing kickoff.<ref name=nelson515>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=David|title=The anatomy of a game: football, the rules, and the men who made the game |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OmwfnipKuogC&pg=PA476&dq=%22Roughing+the+kicker+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TdgJT4GwKMro0QGm6tyfAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Roughing%20the%20kicker%20%22&f=false|page=515}}</ref>



==History==
In 1914, the term "roughing the kicker" came into use. Previously, it was known as "running into the fullback after the kick."<ref name=nelson476>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=David|title=The anatomy of a game: football, the rules, and the men who made the game |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=OmwfnipKuogC&pg=PA476&dq=%22Roughing+the+kicker+%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TdgJT4GwKMro0QGm6tyfAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Roughing%20the%20kicker%20%22&f=false|page=476}}</ref>

In 1917, penalties for roughing the kicker were measured from the spot where the ball was put out of play.<ref name=nelson476/>
