'''Earl of Enniskillen''' is a title in the [[Peerage of Ireland]]. It was created in [[1789]] for '''William Cole, 2nd Baron Mountflorence'''. He had already been created '''Viscount Enniskillen''' in the Peerage of Ireland in [[1776]]. The title of '''Baron Mountflorence''', of Florence Court in the County of Fermanagh, was created in the Peerage of Ireland in [[1760]] for his father '''John Cole''', who had earlier represented [[Enniskillen (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Enniskillen]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. 

Lord Enniskillen was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented [[Fermanagh (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh]] in the [[British House of Commons]], served as [[Lord Lieutenant of County Fermanagh]] and sat as an [[Representative peer|Irish Representative Peer]] in the [[House of Lords]] from [[1804]] to [[1840]]. In [[1815]] he was created '''Baron Grinstead''', of Grinstead in the County of Wiltshire, in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]], which gave him and the later Earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords. 

His son, the third Earl, was a [[palaeontologist]] and also sat as [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] for Fermanagh. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl, who represented [[Enniskillen (UK Parliament constituency)|Enniskillen]] in Parliament as a Conservative. His son, the fifth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Fermanagh. He was succeeded by his nephew, the sixth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Galbraith Lowry Egerton Cole, third son of the fourth Earl. As of [[2007]] the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in [[1989]].  

The ancestral seat of the Cole family was [[Florence Court]] in [[County Fermanagh]]. The house has been in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] since [[1953]].
