'''''Rag Doll''''' is a [[1961 in film|1961]] British [[B-movie]] crime film, directed by [[Lance Comfort]] and starring actor and singer [[Jess Conrad]].  The film gained a new audience in the 2000s in response to Conrad's elevation to cult status as a purveyor of late-1950s and early-1960s pre-Beatles British kitsch, and received a Region 2 DVD release in 2009 in a double bill with Comfort's 1962 film ''[[The Painted Smile]]''.

==Plot==
17 year-old Carol (Christina Gregg) flees her small-town home to escape from her alcoholic stepfather, and heads off to London to live with her aunt.  Once in London she is drawn to the sleazy excitement of [[Soho]] and finds work in a coffee bar.  She falls in love with handsome young nightclub singer Joe Shane (Conrad) and soon they are a couple.  She then discovers that Joe is a small-time crook on the side, with a gang background and a line in petty burglary.

At work, Carol finds herself on the receiving end of lecherous advances from all manner of older men including Wilson ([[Kenneth Griffith]]), who professes to be in love with her and is also known to be wealthy.  Joe sees a chance to turn a profit, and encourages Carol to lead Wilson on and let him act as her protector, to provide them with an opportunity to lay their hands on some easy money.  However Joe's schemes go disastrously wrong and he ends up being shot dead during an attempted robbery, leaving Carol alone and pregnant.
