'''Interstate 81''' ('''I-81''') is a part of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that runs from [[Dandridge, Tennessee]] to [[Fishers Landing, New York]].  In [[Maryland]], the Interstate highway runs {{convert|12.08|mi|km}} from the [[West Virginia]] state line at the [[Potomac River]] in [[Williamsport, Maryland|Williamsport]] north to the [[Pennsylvania]] state line near [[Maugansville, Maryland|Maugansville]].  I-81 is the primary north&ndash;south Interstate highway in [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]], connecting [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] with [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] to the north and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]], [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]], and [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] to the south.  I-81, which like all mainline Interstate highways is a part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], is the shortest mainline Interstate in Maryland and contains the shortest portion of I-81 of all six states through which the Interstate highway passes.<ref name="National Highway System"/><ref name="Interstate System FotD"/>  The Interstate was dedicated as Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987.<ref name="Interstate System FotD"/>

The idea of a north&ndash;south bypass of Hagerstown to relieve congestion on the contemporary main highway through the [[Hagerstown Valley]], [[U.S. Route 11 in Maryland|U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;11]] (US&nbsp;11), predates the Interstate system.  Construction on the Hagerstown Bypass began in the mid 1950s and was completed in 1958 from [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]] north to the Pennsylvania state line.  I-81 was assigned to the new freeway in 1959.  The southern section of the freeway from the Potomac River to US&nbsp;40 was built starting in 1962 and completed in 1966.  Beyond interchange improvements, I-81 has changed very little from the four-lane freeway of the 1960s.  Long-range plans call for widening I-81 to six lanes and effecting further interchange improvements along what is a major commuting and trucking corridor.

==Route description==
[[File:I-81 northbound at I-70 exit.jpg|thumb|left|I-81 northbound at I-70 interchange]]
I-81 crosses the Potomac River from West Virginia and enters Maryland as a four-lane freeway with a speed limit of {{convert|65|mph|km/h}}.  The Interstate curves to the northeast around Williamsport, where the highway meets [[Maryland Route 68|MD&nbsp;68]] and [[Maryland Route 63|MD&nbsp;63]] (Lappans Road) at a [[diamond interchange]] (Exit 1) to the south of the town and US&nbsp;11 (Virginia Avenue) at a [[partial cloverleaf interchange]] (Exit 2) to the east.  Beyond US&nbsp;11, I-81's speed limit drops to {{convert|60|mph|km/h}}.  The Interstate passes along the edge of the Hagerstown suburb of [[Halfway, Maryland|Halfway]], where the highway meets I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway) at a [[cloverleaf interchange]] (Exit 4) with [[collector/distributor road|collector-distributor lanes]] on both I-81 and I-70.  Traffic for [[Interstate 68|I-68]] is advised to use I-70 west.  I-81 meets Halfway Boulevard, which leads to several shopping centers including the [[Valley Mall (Hagerstown)|Valley Mall]], at a partial cloverleaf interchange (Exit 5).<ref name="Washington HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps I-81 in MD"/>

I-81 continues northeast along the west edge of Hagerstown.  The Interstate crosses [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]'s [[Lurgan Subdivision]] and passes under [[Maryland Route 144|MD&nbsp;144]] with no access before reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US&nbsp;40 (National Pike) (Exit 6).  The freeway intersects [[Maryland Route 58|MD&nbsp;58]] (Cearfoss Pike) at a partial cloverleaf interchange (Exit 7).  Immediately to the north, I-81 has a partial interchange with Maugansville Road (Exit 8) featuring a loop exit ramp from southbound I-81 and a straight entrance ramp to the northbound direction.  The Interstate curves to the north and crosses [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s [[Lurgan Branch]].  The speed limit increases to {{convert|65|mph|km/h}} as the Interstate passes along the eastern edge of Maugansville, where the highway meets Maugans Avenue at a diamond interchange (Exit 9).  I-81 meets Showalter Road, which is used to access [[Hagerstown Regional Airport]], at a cloverleaf interchange (Exit 10) as the freeway gently curves around the airport's runway.  The Interstate heads northeast to the Pennsylvania state line, on top of which the highway meets [[Pennsylvania Route 163|PA&nbsp;163]] (Mason Dixon Road) at Exit 1 of the Pennsylvania exit sequence.  The southbound exit ramp to and entrance ramp from PA&nbsp;163 are in Maryland and the northbound ramps are in Pennsylvania.<ref name="Washington HLR"/><ref name="Google Maps I-81 in MD"/>

==History==
[[File:I-81 northbound at Maugans Avenue exit.jpg|thumb|right|I-81 northbound at Maugans Avenue interchange]]
The first section of I-81 to be constructed in Maryland was the pre-Interstate Hagerstown Bypass that was planned to provide relief to the existing north&ndash;south highway through downtown Hagerstown, US&nbsp;11.<ref name="1958 src report"/>  The highway was planned to run from US&nbsp;40 west of downtown Hagerstown to the Pennsylvania state line, where the [[Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|Pennsylvania Department of Highways]] would continue the bypass north to tie into US&nbsp;11 near [[Greencastle, Pennsylvania|Greencastle]].<ref name="1956 map"/>  Preliminary engineering on the Hagerstown Bypass began in 1954 and construction began in 1956, by which time a southern extension was planned south to US&nbsp;11 east of Williamsport.<ref name="1958 src report"/><ref name="1956 map"/><ref name="1956 src report"/>  The freeway was completed from US&nbsp;40 (now MD&nbsp;144) to the Pennsylvania state line in 1958, including an interchange with the present alignment of US&nbsp;40 west of downtown Hagerstown, a highway that was completed around 1963.<ref name="1958 map"/><ref name="1963 map"/>  Traffic from the Hagerstown Bypass followed Mason Dixon Road to US&nbsp;11 until the bypass was extended into Pennsylvania and tied into US&nbsp;11 around modern Exit 3 in 1960.<ref name="1959 map"/><ref name="1960 map"/><ref name="NBI PA 163"/>  The new freeway was marked as I-81 beginning in 1959.<ref name="1959 map"/>

Construction on the portion of I-81 south of US&nbsp;40 began in 1962 to fill a gap between the portion of I-81 in Maryland and the portion of the Interstate completed between [[West Virginia Route 9|WV&nbsp;9]] near Martinsburg and US&nbsp;11 southwest of Williamsport in West Virginia.<ref name="1962 map"/>  MD&nbsp;144's bridge over I-81 was constructed in 1963 once the relocated US&nbsp;40 opened.<ref name="1963 map"/><ref name="NBI MD 144"/>  The cloverleaf interchange between I-81 and the future I-70 was constructed in 1964, including the collector/distributor lanes.<ref name="NBI I-70 CD"/>  The remainder of the highway south to the Potomac River, including the bridge over the Potomac River, was under construction by 1965.<ref name="NBI Potomac River"/>  The southern section of I-81 from the West Virginia state line to US&nbsp;40 opened in 1966.<ref name="Interstate System FotD"/><ref name="1967 map"/>

I-81 remains very similar to when it was completed in 1966.  Exit numbers were first marked in 1974; these exit numbers have not changed.<ref name="1974 map"/>  The Maugansville Road interchange was originally a full interchange, but was reduced to a partial interchange in 1968.<ref name="1964 map"/><ref name="1968 map"/>  The interchange with MD&nbsp;68 and MD&nbsp;63 south of Williamsport originally only had a northbound exit ramp and a southbound entrance ramp; ramps to and from the direction of Hagerstown were added between 1981 and 1989.<ref name="1972 map"/><ref name="USGS 1981 Topo"/><ref name="USGS 1989 Aerial"/>  The junction with Halfway Boulevard was a diamond interchange until it was rebuilt as a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2001.<ref name="1972 map"/><ref name="Washington HLR 2001"/><ref name="Hagerstown Projects"/>

==Future==
I-81 is presently heavily congested within Maryland due to the 1960s era freeway being used as both a commuter route within a rapidly growing [[Hagerstown Metropolitan Area|metropolitan area]] as well as a major trucking corridor.  In 2009, the highway had a minimum [[annual average daily traffic]] of 47,030 between Showalter Road and PA&nbsp;163 and a maximum of 68,040 between I-70 and Halfway Boulevard.<ref name="Washington HLR"/>  The Interstate is often used by long-distance traffic as an alternative to [[Interstate 95|I-95]] to avoid traveling through the major cities of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].  As a result, in 2001 the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]] began developing long-term plans to upgrade the entire length of I-81 in Maryland.  The state completed the planning process for the eventual upgrades to the Interstate highway in November 2010; the next step is preliminary engineering work.  The state plans to expand I-81 to six lanes to address capacity concerns.  In addition, many of the interchanges will be rebuilt to reduce or eliminate [[Grade separation#Weaving|weaving]].  In particular:
*The collector-distributor lanes within the I-70 interchange would be extended north through the Halfway Boulevard interchange.
*The US&nbsp;40 and Showalter Road interchanges would be changed from a full cloverleaf interchange to a partial interchange by removing the two loop ramps from the crossroad onto I-81.
*The MD&nbsp;58 interchange may be converted from a partial cloverleaf interchange to a diamond interchange.
*The Maugans Avenue diamond interchange may have a loop ramp added from westbound Maugans Avenue to southbound I-81.
At almost every interchange, acceleration and deceleration lanes would be lengthened to modern standards.  The ramps within the I-70 interchange would be modified to better handle traffic passing between two freeways.  Auxiliary lanes would be added in both directions between the US&nbsp;40 and MD&nbsp;58 interchanges, and southbound between the Showalter Road and Maugans Avenue interchanges.  In addition, there is an option to construct a truck [[weigh station]] somewhere along I-81 within the state; there are presently no weigh stations along either the Maryland or West Virginia segments of I-81.<ref name="I-81 Project Information"/>
