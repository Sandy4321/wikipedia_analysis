'''''The Lion King''''' is a 1994 American animated [[musical film|musical]] [[adventure film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] and released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. It is the 32nd animated feature in the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney Animated Classics]] series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by the [[Bible|biblical]] tales of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] and the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] play ''[[Hamlet]]''. The film was produced during a period known as the [[Disney Renaissance]]. ''The Lion King'' was directed by [[Roger Allers]] and [[Rob Minkoff]], produced by [[Don Hahn]], and has a screenplay credited to [[Irene Mecchi]], [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] and [[Linda Woolverton]]. Its songs were written by composer [[Elton John]] and lyricist [[Tim Rice]], with an original score by [[Hans Zimmer]]. The film features a large [[Ensemble cast|ensemble voice cast]] led by  [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Jeremy Irons]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Jonathan Taylor Thomas]], [[Moira Kelly]] and [[Nathan Lane]]. ''The Lion King'' tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is fooled into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.

Development of ''The Lion King'' began in 1988 during a meeting between [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Roy E. Disney]] and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] while promoting ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' in Europe. [[Thomas Disch]] wrote a [[film treatment]], and Woolverton developed the first scripts while [[George Scribner]] was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in [[Kenya]] to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences took place at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] in Florida. [[Computer animation]] was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede scene.

''The Lion King'' was released on June 15, 1994 to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation. Following a [[3D film|3D]] re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US $987 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest-grossing hand-drawn film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States and the [[List of highest-grossing films|19th-highest-grossing feature film]] of all time. ''The Lion King'' garnered two [[Academy Award]]s for its achievement in music and the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture <U+2013> Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture <U+2013> Musical or Comedy]].  The film lead to many derived works, such as [[The Lion King (musical)|a Broadway adaptation]], two [[direct-to-video]] follow-ups - sequel ''[[The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' (1998) and the prequel/[[Sequel#Parallel|parallel]] ''[[The Lion King 1<U+00BD>]]'' (2004) - and spin-off series ''[[Timon and Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon and Pumbaa]]''.

==Plot==
In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of son [[Simba]] to King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. 

After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the domain, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the circle of life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden [[elephants' graveyard|elephant graveyard]], despite the protests of Mufasa's [[hornbill]] [[majordomo]] Zazu. At the graveyard, the [[spotted hyena]]s Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba.

The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of [[wildebeest]] into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar announces to the other lions that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.

After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. [[Timon and Pumbaa]], a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto "[[hakuna matata]]" ("no worries"). 

When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry.

As Simba enters the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's [[mandrill]] friend and advisor, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is "alive" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight.

At the Pride Lands, Simba confronts Scar, who taunts Simba over his "part" in Mufasa's death. But when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he admits he himself killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the other lions. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, saying he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba says he does not believe Scar anymore, but spares his life and commands him to forever leave the Pride Lands. Scar meekly walks past him, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce battle, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them.

With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands and the "circle of life" continues.

===Development===
The idea for ''The Lion King'' was conceived in late 1988 during a conversation between [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Roy E. Disney]] and [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]] on a plane to Europe to promote ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.<ref name="memoir">{{cite video|title=The Lion King: A Memoir <U+2013> Don Hahn|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |format=Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> The idea was then developed by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink.<ref name="neuwirth" /> Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death,<ref name="pride" /> and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, "It is a little bit about myself."<ref name="pride" /> In November of that year [[Thomas Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'') wrote a [[film treatment|treatment]] entitled ''King of the Kalahari'',<ref name="LionKingDisch">{{cite web |url=http://news.jamescumminsbookseller.com/?p=59|title=The Origins of 'The Lion King'|accessdate=2011-10-22|publisher=James Cummins Book Seller}}</ref> and afterwards [[Linda Woolverton]] spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled ''King of the Beasts'' and then ''King of the Jungle''.<ref name="neuwirth" /> The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah,<ref name="pride">{{cite video|title=The Pride of the King|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |format=Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref> and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.<ref name="dvdcommentary" /> Simba would also not leave the kingdom, but become a "lazy, slovenly, horrible character" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age.<ref name="neuwirth">{{cite book|title=Makin' toons: inside the most popular animated TV shows and movies|first=Allan|last=Neuwirth|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc.|year=2003|isbn=978-1-58115-269-2}}</ref> By 1990, producer [[Thomas Schumacher]], who had just completed ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', decided to attach himself to the project "because lions are cool".<ref name="neuwirth" /> Schumacher  likened the script for ''King of the Jungle'' to "an animated ''[[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]]'' special".<ref name=schu/>

''Oliver & Company'' director [[George Scribner]] was the initial director of the film,<ref name="mane" /> being later joined by [[Roger Allers]], who was the lead story man on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in October 1991.<ref name="memoir" /> Allers brought with him [[Brenda Chapman]], who would become the head of story.<ref name="neuwirth" /> Afterwards, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Hahn, Chapman, and production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]], took a trip to [[Hell's Gate National Park]] in Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.<ref name="art" /> After six months of story development work Scribner decided to leave the project, as he clashed with Allers and the producers on their decision to turn the film into a musical, as Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.<ref name="memoir" /><ref name="mattinson" /> [[Rob Minkoff]] replaced Scribner,<ref name="art" /> and producer [[Don Hahn]] joined the production as Schumacher became only an executive producer due to Disney promoting him to Vice President of Development for Feature Animation.<ref name=schu>{{cite press release|url=http://www.disney.com.au/tlk/media/TLK_Media_Kit_v4.pdf|title=The Lion King: The Landmark Musical Event|year=2013|publisher=Walt Disney Company|accessdate=2014-02-14|page=7}}</ref> Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as "leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directors [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Gary Trousdale]], who had just finished ''Beauty and the Beast''.<ref name="art">{{cite book|title=The art of The Lion King |author=Finch, Christopher |pages=165<U+2013>193|chapter=Afterword|publisher=Hyperion|year=1994|isbn=978-0-7868-6028-9}}</ref> The script also had its title changed from ''King of the Jungle'' to ''The Lion King'', as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.<ref name="memoir" />

''The Lion King'' was the first Disney animated feature to be an original story, rather than being based on an already-existing work. The filmmakers have said that the story of ''The Lion King'' was inspired by the [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Moses]] stories from the [[Bible]] and [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]''.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins">{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Origins|medium=DVD |publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=1994-06-15}}</ref> During the summer of 1992, the team was joined by screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]], with a second screenwriter, [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]], joining a few months later. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comic business for Pumbaa, Timon and the hyenas.<ref name="LionKingProduction">{{cite press release|url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=2008-08-05|publisher=Walt Disney Pictures|date=1994-05-25}}</ref>  Lyricist [[Tim Rice]] worked closely with the writing team, flying to California at least once a month, as his songs needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics <U+2013> which were reworked up to the production's end <U+2013> were even pinned to the [[storyboard]]s during development.<ref name="art" /> Rewrites were frequent, with animator [[Andreas Deja]] saying that completed scenes would be delivered only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated due to dialog changes.<ref name="neuwirth" />

===Casting===
The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters <U+2013> for instance, [[James Earl Jones]] was cast because the directors found his voice "powerful" and similar to a lion's roar.<ref name="making"/> Jones commented that during the years of production, Mufasa "became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king".<ref name=fone/> [[Nathan Lane]] originally auditioned for Zazu, and [[Ernie Sabella]] for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.<ref name="making">{{cite video | title =The Making of The Lion King | location=''The Lion King'' [[laserdisc]]| medium =Laserdisc| publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  |year=1995}}</ref><ref name="latimes">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/sep/15/entertainment/la-et-lion-king-20110915|title=A 'Lion's' tale|first=Susan|last=King|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-24}}</ref> For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite [[Cheech & Chong]], but while [[Cheech Marin]] accepted to play Banzai, [[Tommy Chong]] was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by [[Whoopi Goldberg]].<ref name="dvdcommentary" /> Matthew Broderick was cast as adult Simba early during production, and during the three years of voice acting only recorded with another actor once, and only discovered Moira Kelly voiced Nala at the premiere.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/27/movies/at-the-movies.html|title=The Lion Evolves|work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Kehr|date=December 27, 2002|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref> Jeremy Irons had at first refused the role due to not being comfortable going from the dramatic performance as [[Claus von B<U+00FC>low]] in ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' to a comedic role. But once he came in, Irons' performance even inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von B<U+00FC>low - even adding one of that character's lines, "You have no idea" - and animator Andreas Deja to watch both ''Reversal of Fortune'' and ''[[Damage (1992 film)|Damage]]''  to pick up Irons' facial traits and tics.<ref name=fone>{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2011/09/15/jeremy-irons-and-james-earl-jones-on-the-lion-king-3d-and-keep/|title=Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones on 'The Lion King 3D' and Keeping It Together When Mufasa Dies|publisher=Moviefone|date=September 15, 2011|first= Aiden |last=Redmond|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-15/entertainment/ca-57883_1_jeremy-irons|title=SUMMER SNEAKS '94 : You Can't Hide His Lion Eyes |work=The Los Angeles Times|date=May 15, 1994|first=Chris|last=Willman|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref>

===Animation===
{{Quote box|width =33%|quote="''The Lion King'' was considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks. The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by his uncle set to the music of Elton John. People said, 'What? Good luck with that.' But for some reason, the people who ended up on the movie were highly passionate about it and motivated."|source=Don Hahn<ref name=latimes/>}}
The development of ''The Lion King'' started concurrently with  ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'', which most of the animators of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] decided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name="PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins" /> The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with [[Brenda Chapman]] declaring she was reluctant to accept the job "because the story wasn't very good",<ref name="neuwirth" /> and writer [[Burny Mattinson]] saying to co-worker [[Joe Ranft]] about the film that "I don't know who is going to want to watch that one."<ref name="mattinson">{{cite book|title=Walt's People -, Volume 9|editor=Ghez, Didier|author=Norman, Floyd|pages=463<U+2013>464|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4500-8746-9}}</ref> Most of the leading animators were either doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.<ref name="pride" /> Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters included [[Mark Henn]] on young Simba, [[Ruben A. Aquino]] on adult Simba, [[Andreas Deja]] on Scar, Aaron Blaise on young Nala, [[Anthony DeRosa]] on adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.<ref name="LionKingProduction" /> Nearly 20 minutes of the film, including the "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" sequence,<ref name="dvdcommentary">Allers, Roger; Hahn, Don, and Minkoff, Rob (1995). Laserdisc/DVD audio commentary for ''The Lion King''. Walt Disney Home Entertainment</ref> were animated at the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios|Disney-MGM Studios]] facility. Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to ''The Lion King'' over the course of its production.<ref name="mane" /> Weeks before the film was to be released, production was affected by the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], which shut off the studio and required the animators to finish their work from home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/producer-don-hahn-shares-his-experiences-working-on-9456197.html?cat=40|title=Producer Don Hahn Shares His Experiences Working on 'The Lion King'|first=Eric|last=Shirey|publisher=Yahoo!|date=Sep 28, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-24}}</ref>

The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the 1942 Disney film ''[[Bambi]]''. [[Jim Fowler]], renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel.<ref name="art" /> The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries <U+2013> which employ [[telephoto lens]]es to shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher <U+2013> which, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such as [[lens flare]] <U+2013> and the works of painters [[Charles Marion Russell]], [[Frederic Remington]] and [[Maxfield Parrish]].<ref name="art" /><ref>{{cite book|page=66|title=Dream worlds: production design for animation|first=Hans P.|last=2007|publisher=Focal Press|isbn=0-240-52093-9}}</ref> Since the characters were not anthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through usage of longer shots following the characters.<ref name="dvdcommentary" />

The use of computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the "wildebeest stampede" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. <!--the "Be Prepared" sequence was done by animating a handful of hyenas by hand and duplicating them, not my using he same CGI process as the wildebeests--><ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=1994-06-15}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half minute stampede sequence.<ref name="LionKingProduction" /> Other usages of computer animation were done through [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]], which helped simulate camera movements such as [[tracking shot]]s, and was employed on the coloring, lighting and particle effects.<ref name="dvdcommentary" />

==Music==
{{Main|The Lion King (soundtrack)}}

Lyricist [[Tim Rice]], who was working with composer [[Alan Menken]] on songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', was invited to write the songs, and accepted on the condition of finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of [[Elton John]],<ref name="making" /> after Rice's invitation of [[ABBA]] fell through due to [[Benny Andersson]] being busy with the musical ''[[Kristina fr<U+00E5>n Duvem<U+00E5>la]]''.<ref name="pride" /> John expressed an interest in writing "ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them", mentioning a possible influence of ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', where he felt the "music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Elton John: The Billboard Interview|last=White|first=Timothy|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=95<U+2013>96|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1wkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA27|date=1997-10-04}}</ref>

John and Rice wrote five original songs for this film ("[[Circle of Life]]", "[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]", "[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]", "[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]" and "[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]") with the singer's performance of "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" playing over the end credits.<ref name="music" /> The [[IMAX]] and DVD releases added another song, "The Morning Report", which was based on a song discarded during development that eventually got featured in [[The Lion King (musical)|the live musical version of ''The Lion King'']].<ref>{{cite video | title =The Making of The Morning Report|location=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1) | medium =DVD  | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date=1994-06-15}}</ref> The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]], who was hired based on his work in two films in African settings, ''[[The Power of One (film)|The Power of One]]'' and ''[[A World Apart (film)|A World Apart]]'',<ref name="art" /> and supplemented the score with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref name="music">{{cite video | title =The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), Music: African Influence  | medium =DVD  | publisher =[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]  | date=1994-06-15}}</ref> Zimmer's partners [[Mark Mancina]] and [[Jay Rifkin]] helped with arrangements and song production.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Lion King|others=Hans Zimmer, Elton John, Tim Rice|publisher=[[Walt Disney Records]] |type=Original soundtrack|year=1994|id=60858-7}}</ref>

The use of the song "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa has led to disputes between Disney and the family of South African [[Solomon Linda]], who composed the song (originally titled "Mbube") in 1939. In July 2004, the family filed suit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a legal settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.<ref name="undisclosed">{{cite news |publisher=BBC News|date=2006-02-16 |title=Disney settles Lion song dispute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4721564.stm | accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>

==Release==
For ''The Lion King''{{'}}s first [[film trailer]], Disney opted to for the first time feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song "Circle of Life". [[Buena Vista Pictures Distribution]] president [[Dick Cook]] said the decision was made for such an approach because "we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen", and Don Hahn added that "Circle of Life" worked as a trailer as it "came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying ''[[The Three Musketeers (1993 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' in theaters, as only a third of ''The Lion King'' had been completed.<ref name=den/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-29/entertainment/ca-62180_1_lion-king|date=November 29, 1993|author=Welkos, Robert W.|title=Will 'Lion King' Be Disney's Next 'Beast'?|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.<ref name=den>{{cite web|author=Brew, Simon|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/18284/don-hahn-interview-the-lion-king-disney-pixar-frankenweenie-and-the-future-of-animation|title=Don Hahn interview: The Lion King, Disney, Pixar, Frankenweenie and the future of animation|publisher=Den of Geek ([[Dennis Publishing]])|date=2011-11-03|accessdate=2014-04-05}}</ref> Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 [[test screening]]s.<ref name=70mm/>

===== IMAX and large-format =====
The film was re-issued on December 25, 2002 for [[IMAX]] and [[large-format]] theaters.

===Critical response {{anchor|Critics}} ===
''The Lion King'' was released to critical acclaim. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calculated an overall approval rating of 90% with a [[weighted average]] score of 8.2/10 based on 96 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lion_king/| accessdate=2006-09-24}}</ref> [[Metacritic]]'s [[Standard score|normalized score]] calculated an average of 83/100 based on 14 reviews.<ref name="meta">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lion-king | title=The Lion King (1994): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS]] |accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3 1/2 out of 4-stars and called the film "a superbly drawn animated feature" and, in his print review wrote, "The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to ''Hamlet'', is a learning experience as well as an entertainment."<ref name="tlkebertreview">{{cite web | last=Ebert | first=Roger | authorlink =Roger Ebert |work=rogerebert.com |date=June 24, 1994 | title=The Lion King review | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lion-king-1994| accessdate =April 14, 2014}}</ref> On the television program ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|Siskel & Ebert]]'', the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to previous Disney films. Ebert and his partner [[Gene Siskel]] both gave the film a "Thumbs Up" but Siskel said that it was not as good as earlier films such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and was "a good film, not a great one".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper]]| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=1140 | accessdate=2008-02-28 |archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080514012002/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&subsec=1140 |archivedate =2008-05-14}}</ref> Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "an impressive, almost daunting achievement" and felt that the film was "spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations", but was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, "Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange."<ref name="washingtonpost">{{cite news | last=Hinson | first=Hal |work=The Washington Post|date=1994-06-24| title=The Lion King review|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/lionkinghin.htm| accessdate=2008-08-06}}</ref>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film, writing that it "has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie".<ref>{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=1994-06-24| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302734~1~~,00.html| accessdate=2008-08-12}}</ref>
''[[Rolling Stone]]'' film critic [[Peter Travers]] praised the film and felt that it was "a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart".<ref>{{cite web|last=Travers|first=Peter |work=Rolling Stone|date=1994-07-14| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947315/review/5947316/the_lion_king|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080429201931/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947315/review/5947316/the_lion_king|archivedate=2008-04-29| accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] from ReelViews praised the film saying, "With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more. ''The Lion King'' is the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded."<ref>{{cite web|last=Berardinelli|first=James | publisher=ReelViews.net| title=''The Lion King'' review|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=39| accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

Some reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative. The staff of ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote that while ''The Lion King'' was technically proeficient and entertaining, it "offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution."<ref>{{cite web| work=TV Guide| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/lion-king/review/129956| accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like "manipulat[ing] our responses at will", as "Between traumas, the movie serves up  soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy".<ref>{{cite web| work=New Yorker|author=Rafferty, Terrence| title=''The Lion King'' movie review|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/the_lion_king_minkoff| accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref>

Certain elements of the film were considered to bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s Japanese [[anime]] television show, ''[[Kimba the White Lion]]'', with characters having analogues, and various individual scenes being nearly identical in composition and camera angle.

===Sequels and spin-offs===
The first ''Lion King''-related animated projects involved the characters of Timon and Pumbaa. First the duo starred in the animated short "Stand by Me", featuring Timon singing [[Stand by Me (song)|the eponymous song]], which was released in 1995 accompanying the theatrical release of ''[[Tom and Huck]]''. Then the duo received their own animated show, ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|The Lion King's Timon and Pumbaa]]'', which ran for three seasons and 85 episodes between 1995 and 1999. Ernie Sabella continued to voice Pumbaa, while Timon was voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]] and [[Kevin Schon]] in addition to Nathan Lane himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Walt Disney's animated characters|author=Grant, John|page=150|publisher=Hyperion Books|year=1998|ISBN=0786863366}}</ref>
