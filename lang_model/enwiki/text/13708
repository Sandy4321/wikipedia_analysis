The '''M1911''' is a [[Trigger (mechanism)|single action]], [[Semi-automatic self-loading pistol|semi-automatic handgun]], chambered for the [[.45 ACP]] [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. It was designed by [[John Browning]], and was the standard-issue handgun for the [[Military of the United States|United States Armed Forces]] from 1911 to 1985. It was widely used in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. Its formal designation as of 1940 was '''Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911''' for the original Model of 1911 or '''Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1''' for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924. Nomenclature changed to '''Pistol, Caliber .45, Automatic, M1911A1''' in the Vietnam era. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911 and M1911A1 pistols during its service life.

The same basic design has also been offered commercially, and has been used by other militaries. In addition to the .45 ACP, models chambered for [[.38 Super]], [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9 mm Parabellum]] and other cartridges were also offered. The M1911 was developed from earlier [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] designs firing rounds such as [[.38 ACP]]. The design beat out many other contenders during the government's selection period, during the late 1890s and 1900s, up to the pistol's adoption. The M1911 officially replaced a range of revolvers and pistols across branches of the U.S. armed forces, though a number of other designs would see some use over in certain niches.

The M1911 is the most well-known of John Browning's design to use the [[Recoil operation#Short recoil operation|short recoil]] principle in its basic design. Besides the pistol being widely copied itself, this operating system rose to become the pre-eminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern pistols.

==History==
===Early history and adoption===
The [[firearm]] originated in the late 1890s' search for a suitable self-loading handgun to replace the variety of .38 revolvers then in service. The U.S. Armed Forces were adopting new firearms at a phenomenal rate <U+2014> several new handguns and two all-new service rifles (the [[Krag-J<U+00F8>rgensen#American Krag-J<U+00F8>rgensen rifles|M1892/96/98 Krag]] and [[M1895 Navy Lee]]), as well as a series of revolvers by Colt and [[Smith & Wesson]] for the Army and Navy just in that decade. The next decade would have a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade.

[[Hiram Stevens Maxim|Hiram S. Maxim]] had made a design for an automatic [[pistol]] in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with [[machine gun]]s. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using bullet energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in the 1890s. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century.

During the end of 1899 and start of 1900, a test of self-loading pistols was conducted, which included an entry from [[Mauser]] (caliber 7.63 mm), Mannlicher (caliber 7.6 mm), and Colt, (caliber .38). (See [[Mauser#C96|Mauser C96]], [[Steyr Mannlicher M1894]], and [[Colt M1900]].)

This led to a purchase of 1,000 DWM [[Luger pistol|'Luger' pistols]], chambered for 7.65 mm. These would go on field trials but ran into some issues, especially in regard to round power. Other governments had also levied similar complaints, which resulted in DWM producing an enlarged version of the round <U+2014> the 9 mm Parabellum (a necked-out version of the 7.65 round). Fifty of these were sampled by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as well in 1903.

In response to problems encountered by American units fighting [[Moro Rebellion|Moro]] guerillas during the [[Philippine-American War]], the then-standard [[.38 Long Colt]] revolver was found to be unsuitable for the rigors of [[jungle warfare]], particularly in terms of [[stopping power]], as the Moros had very high battle morale and frequently used native drugs to inhibit the sensation of pain. The U.S. Army briefly reverted to the .45 Colt revolvers which had been standard during the last decades of the 19th century; the slower, heavier bullet was found to be more effective against charging tribesmen. The problems with the .38 Long Colt led to the army shipping new Double Action .45 Colt revolvers to the Philippines in 1902. It also prompted the then-[[Chief of Ordnance]], General [[William Crozier (artillerist)|William Crozier]] to authorize further testing.

[[Image:William_Crozier.jpg|thumb|125px|left|General William Crozier became Chief of Ordnance of the Army in 1901]]

In 1904, the [[Thompson-LaGarde Tests]] were conducted, in which various types of rounds being considered at the time were shot at live [[cow]]s, though the testing was not very consistent. The variation in cows aside, they were not all shot in the same location or all rounds given the exact same test. The rounds tested included .45 Colt (.45 Long Colt), 7.65 mm Luger, 9 mm Luger, .476 Eley, .38 ACP, .455 Man-Stopper. An example was to shoot a cow, then see how long it took to die (such as 4 minutes) and kill it with a hammer if it took too long. Another test was to keep shooting it until it died. The final test was to shoot at a hanging cadaver at various distances and rate the effect.

The end result was that they decided the caliber of the new pistol "should not be of less than .45", as well as some smaller requirements. This led to the 1906 trials, for which various gun makers had produced designs. The Ordnance Board, headed by [[John T. Thompson]], concluded that a .45 caliber (11.4 mm) semi-automatic weapon would be most appropriate, and took bids from six firearms manufacturing companies in 1906. This included Colt, Bergmann, ''[[Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken]]'' (DWM), [[Savage Arms|Savage Arms Company]], Knoble, [[Webley and Scott|Webley]], and White-Merril.

Of the six designs submitted, two were selected for field testing in 1907, one of them being [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]]'s model, which was Browning's earlier auto-loading [[Colt Model 1902]] .38 ACP (.355-inch bullet diameter) design modified by himself to government specifications, resulting in the [[Colt Model 1905]]. Most pistols were eliminated early, leaving the Savage, Colt, and DWM designs. These three still had issues that needed correction, but only Colt and Savage resubmitted their designs. There is some debate over the reasons for DWMs withdrawal <U+2014> some say they "felt" there was bias, though this does not fit well with the earlier 1900 purchase of the DWM design over the Colt and Steyr entries.{{citation needed}} In any case, a series of field tests went on to decide between the Savage and Colt designs, between 1907 and 1911. Both designs were improved between each testing over their initial entries, leading up to the final test before adoption.

Among the areas of success for the Colt, was a 6,000 round test at the end of 1910 attended by [[John Browning|John Moses Browning]]. The Colt gun passed with flying colors, having no malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37.

In order to meet the Ordnance Board's requirements, the 1911 was designed to fire a .45 caliber (11.4 mm), 230-[[Grain (measure)|grain]] (15 [[Gram|g]]) bullet at approximately 800 [[feet per second]] (240 [[Metre per second|m/s]]). These specifications were championed by Gen. Thompson, and were the result of terminal ballistics tests conducted in 1904 at the Nelson Morris Company stockyards in Chicago on live cattle and human cadavers. Some aspects of these tests lacked scientific rigor, but the stopping power of the .45 ACP cartridge was clearly demonstrated. Nearly 70 years later, in the move to the 9 mm [[M9 Pistol]], many similar debates about round effectiveness in a combat handgun were started.

===Service history===
[[Image:Springfield_Armory_M1911A1.JPG|right|thumb|200px|M1911A1 by [[Springfield Armory]] (contempory remake of WWII G.I. Model, [[Parkerize|Parkerized]])]]
[[Image:M151911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[M15 General Officers]] was adopted in the 1970s]]

The weapon was formally adopted by the Army on [[March 29]], [[1911]], thus gaining its designation. It was adopted by the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1913. Originally manufactured only by Colt, demand for the firearm in [[World War I]] saw the expansion of manufacture to the government-owned [[Springfield Armory]].

Battlefield experience in the First World War led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, designated M1911A1. Changes to the original design were minor and consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, a curved mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent hammer "bite"), a wider front sight, a longer spur on the thumb safety, and simplified grip checkering. Those unfamiliar with the design are often unable to tell the difference between the two versions at a glance. No internal changes were made.

====WWII====
[[World War II]] and the years leading up to it created a great demand for the weapon. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including [[Remington Rand]] (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), [[Ithaca Gun Company]] (400,000), [[Union Switch and Signal Company]], [[Singer Corporation|Singer]], the Springfield Armory and [[Rock Island Arsenal]]. So many were produced that, after 1945, the government did not order any new pistols, and simply used existing parts inventories to 'arsenal refinish' guns when necessary.

Before World War II, a small number of Colts were produced under license at the Norwegian weapon factory [[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]] (these Colts were known as "kongsbergcolts"). After the German occupation of Norway the production continued, but this time with a [[Swastika]] mark next to the serial number; these pistols are highly regarded by modern collectors. Captured 1911 pistols were highly prized by German troops as well due to the necessity of capturing or killing an officer for one. The 1911 pattern also formed the basis for the Argentine [[Ballester-Molina]] and certain Spanish [[Star (disambiguation)|Star]] and Llama pistols made after 1922.

====Replacement for most uses====

After the Second World War, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay in the United States Armed Forces, in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]] and was even used during [[Desert Storm]] in some U.S. Army units. It would officially be replaced with a 9 mm sidearm, largely due to considerations of [[NATO]] commitments. The US was one of the few NATO members not using the round, and standardizing to compatible rounds was a major goal. In the Late 1970s, Congress withheld funding for .38 Special ammunition, and the existing M1911A1 were wearing out. This resulted in a program for a new Joint Service handgun run by the Air Force- the result was the [[Beretta 92SB]]. This result was contested by the Army which ran its own competition which eventually lead official adoption of the [[Beretta 92F/FS|Beretta 92F]], on January 14, 1985.  By the later 1980s production was ramping up, among other events (including a controversial retrial, which was boycotted by some entrants) a dangerous problem with slides was discovered that resulted in injuries. This resulted in it being updated to the 92FS standard.  By the early 1990s, most M1911A1s were replaced by the [[M9 Pistol|M9]] though many remain in use by special units, and some units resisted as long as possible. In particular the USMC was against it, and they eventually managed to keep using some M1911, as did many smaller special groups within the armed forces. USSOCOM issued a requirment for a [[.45 ACP]] handgun- the [[OHWS]] trials. This resulted in the [[Heckler & Koch OHWS]] becoming the [[MK23 Mod 0]] Offensive Handgun Weapon System (beating a [[Colt OHWS]]. The M9 did nearly entirely replace .38 revolvers and pistols, though even these can be found in remaining in some places of the Armed Forces that have more flexibility in procuring arms and ammunition.

The U.S. went to the [[9 mm Luger Parabellum|9 x 19 mm NATO]] round with the M9, however, it is poised to at least partially go back to .45 if the [[Joint Combat Pistol]] is a success. Among the requirements for it, are use of the .45 ACP round. If the cancelled [[XM8]] project is any judge, or for that matter the XM9/XM10 pistol trials, what is actually adopted is never certain.

The M9 and M11 will likely remain in service to some degree, as even during the M1911's tenure there was a need for smaller caliber pistols. Whether .45 ACP is re-adopted or not as the standard combat pistol round, 9 mm will likely remain as a permanent replacement for the .38 Special revolvers and pistols.

===Current users===
The M1911A1 design is favored by a large number of police SWAT teams throughout the United States. A large number of military and law enforcement organizations in the United States continue to use (often modified) M1911A1 pistols because they favor the stopping power of the .45 cartridge and the superior handling of the weapon in close fighting. Marine Force Recon, Los Angeles Police Department Special Weapons and Tactics and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta ([[Delta Force]]) are among some of them.

The M1911 is also extremely popular among the general public in the United States for practical and recreational purposes. The pistol is commonly used for concealed carry, personal defense, target shooting, and competition. Numerous aftermarket accessories allow the user to customize the pistol to his or her liking. There are a growing number of manufacturers of 1911-type pistols and the model continues to be quite popular for its reliability, simplicity, and nationalist appeal. Various tactical, target, and compact models are available. Price ranges from a low end of $250 for an imported model to more than $3,000 for the best competition or tactical models such as those by [http://www.wilsoncombat.com/p_tactical_elite.asp Wilson], [http://www.kimberamerica.com/goldmatch.php Kimber] and [http://www.lesbaer.com Les Baer].

====MEU M911====
USMC [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s continue to issue M1911's to [[U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] units. Hand-selected Colt M1911A1 frames were gutted, deburred, and prepared for additional use by the USMC [[Precision Weapon Section]] (PWS) in [[Quantico, VA]]. They were then assembled with after-market grip safeties, ambidextrous thumb safeties, triggers, improved high-visibility sights, accurized barrels, grips, and improved Wilson magazines. These hand-made pistols were tuned to specifications and preferences of end users.

In the late 1980s, then USMC Colonel Robert Young laid out a series of specifications and improvements to make Browning's design ready for 21st century combat, many of which have already been included in MEU(SOC) pistol designs. However, as the U.S. Marine Corps began its process of hand selecting members from its Force Recon to be submitted to [[United States Special Operations Command|USSOCOM]] as [[Marine Corps Special Operations Command - Detachment One]], or MCSOCOM Det-1, the selection of a .45 ACP M1911A1-based pistol meant roughly 150 units would be needed, quickly. The PWS, already backlogged with producing [[DMR]]s, [[U.S. Marine Corps Squad Advanced Marksman Rifle|USMC SAM-R]]s, and updating [[M40A1]]s to [[M40 (rifle)#M40A3|M40A3]]s, so Det-1, based in [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]] began the search for COTS, Commercial Off The Shelf surrogates to use. Given the familiarity with the USMC and [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] (Los Angeles Police Department), and that the LAPD's choice of the Kimber LAPD [[SWAT]] CustomII was met with much enthusiasm, a sole source request was issed to Kimber for such a pistol. Without waiting for their TLE/RII models to be in production, Kimber began producing what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol (ICQB). Maintaining the simple recoil assembly, 5-inch barrel (though using a stainless steel match grade barrel), and internal extractor, the ICQB is not much different from Browning's original design. 

The final units as issued to MCSOCOM Det-1 are the Kimber ICQB's with Surefire IMPL ([[Integrated Military Pistol Light]]), Dawson precision rails, Tritium Novak lo-mount sights, Gemtech TRL Tactical Retention Lanyards, modified Safariland 6004 holsters, and Wilson '47' 7 round magazines. They have reportedly been used with over 15,000 rounds apiece.

The 1911 is slated to be the issue handgun for all Marine Expeditionary Units (Special Operations Capable), and MEU(SOC) pistols are currently being designed, tested, and evaluated for use. Over a century after Browning's original design, the 1911 is still projected to be a preeminent handgun for years to come.

==Design==
Asking for a .45 caliber automatic pistol was a tall order that few manufacturers or inventors attempted successfully in the early 20th century. To accomplish this, Browning settled on a design that is so timeless, it has been changed little in nearly 100 years of production.  The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation.  As the bullet and combustion gasses travel down the barrel, they give momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle.  After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.

At this point, a link pivots the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and brings the barrel to a stop.  As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case pivoting it out and away from the pistol.  The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber.  At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again.

The military mandated a [[grip safety]] and a [[manual safety]].  A grip safety, [[sear (firearm)|sear]] disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911(A1)'s. Several companies have developed a [[firing pin block safety]]. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers use one operated by the grip safety.

Despite being challenged by more modern and lightweight pistol designs in .45 caliber, such as the [[GLOCK 21]], the [[SIGARMS]] [[P220]] and the aforementioned [[Heckler & Koch]] [[Mark 23|Mk 23]], the original 1911 design shows no signs of decreasing popularity. Despite its large size, the M1911 has a very flat profile owing to its single stack design, making the gun surprisingly easy to conceal.

==In Popular Culture==
{{main|M1911 in Popular Culture}}
The .45 Government Model pistol is as ubiquitous in [[film|movies]], [[TV shows|television shows]], [[video games]], and other media as it is in actual use. Produced for almost 100 years, the .45 Government Model automatic has firmly entrenched itself in American society.  In popular culture, it shares the name "Colt .45" with Colt's other famous .45 caliber handgun, the [[Colt Single Action Army handgun|Single Action Army]] "Peacemaker" [[revolver]]. The M1911 is also sometimes called a ".45 ACP", but as noted above, that is the cartridge it fires&mdash;not a proper name for the handgun. Interestingly enough, many early depictions in movies and TV utilized the Spanish Star 9mm variant since an effective .45 ACP blank that could operate the action were hard to come by. Actual .45 Government Models were used in non-firing close ups.

<blockquote>"The 1911 was the design given by God to us through John M. Browning that represents the epitome of what a killing tool needs to be. It was true in 1911 and is true now." <U+2014>Colonel Robert J. Coates, USMC</blockquote>
