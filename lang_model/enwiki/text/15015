'''Barney Frank''' (born March 31, 1940) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House Representative]] for {{ushr|MA|4|}}, serving since 1981. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

From 2007 to 2010, Frank was the chairman of the [[House Financial Services Committee]], which oversees the entire financial services industry including the securities, insurance, banking, and housing industries and was considered to be one of the most powerful members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/washington/13barneybox.html| title=A Way With Words|publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=May 13, 2008|accessdate= 2009-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/11/60minutes/main4663945_page2.shtml |title=Barney Frank on Bailouts, Welfare |work=[[60 Minutes]] |date=December 14, 2008 |author=Bar-On, Shachar (prod.)}}</ref>  He lost the position after the Democratic Party lost its majority in the House following the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]].

==Early life==

Frank was born Barnett Frank<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/57533-barney-frank-has-eye-on-cabinet-post|title=Barney Frank wants Cabinet post|first=Bob|last=Cusack|date=September 7, 2009|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=September 8, 2009}}</ref> to a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], one of four children of Sam and Elsie.  Frank's father ran a [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] truck stop<U+2014>a place Frank describes as "totally corrupt"<U+2014>and served a year in prison, when Frank was 6 or 7, for refusing to testify to a [[grand jury]] against Frank's uncle.<ref name="Toobin"/>  Frank was educated at [[Harvard College]], where he resided in [[Matthews Hall (Harvard University)|Matthews Hall]] his first year and then in [[Kirkland House]] and [[Winthrop House]], graduating in 1962. Frank's undergraduate studies were interrupted by the death of his father, and Frank took a year off to help resolve the family's affairs prior to his graduation.<ref name="Toobin"/> He taught undergraduates at Harvard while studying for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], but left in 1968 before completing the degree, to become [[Boston]] mayor [[Kevin White (mayor)|Kevin White]]'s Chief Assistant, a position he held for three years. He then served for a year as Administrative Assistant to Congressman [[Michael J. Harrington]].  Frank later graduated from [[Harvard Law School]], in 1977, while serving as Massachusetts State Representative.

==Career==

In 1972 Frank was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] where he served for eight years. Frank made a name for himself in the mid-1970s as a political defender of the [[Combat Zone (Boston)|Combat Zone]], Boston's notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank's district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), Frank introduced a bill into the [[Massachusetts General Court]] that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston's Financial District. <ref>{{cite news |title=A Frank Suggestion: Hookers in the Financial District |work=Boston Herald-American |date=November 25, 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Guest Post: Anne Gray Fischer Presents A History of 'The Combat Zone' |url=http://v.tgdn.net/2009/09/guest-post-anne-gray-fischer-history-of-the-combat-zone.html |author=Fischer, Anne Gray |work=Vernacular |date=September 29, 2009}}</ref> The bill, which had the support of Boston's Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him having attempted to permit red light districts in all Bay State communities.

While in state and local government, Frank taught part time at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]], the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard and at [[Boston University]]. He published numerous articles on politics and public affairs, and in 1992 he published ''Speaking Frankly'', an essay on the role the Democratic Party should play in the 1990s.

In 1979, Frank [[Admission to the bar in the United States|was admitted to the bar]] in Massachusetts. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in the 4th congressional district, hoping to succeed Father [[Robert Drinan]], who had left Congress following a call by [[Pope John Paul II]] for [[priest]]s to withdraw from political positions. In the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] held on September 16, 1980, Frank won 51.3 percent of the vote in a four-candidate field. His nearest opponent, Arthur J. Clark, won 45.9 percent and finished almost 4,500 votes behind.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://ia360903.us.archive.org/0/items/massachusettsele1980mass/massachusettsele1980mass.pdf |title=Massachusetts Election Results, 1980}}</ref> As the Democratic nominee, Frank faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Richard A. Jones in the [[general election]] and won narrowly, 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/1980election.pdf |title=1980 election results |publisher=Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives}}</ref>

For his first term, Frank represented a district in the western and southern suburbs of [[Boston]], anchored by [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] and [[Newton, Massachusetts]].  However, in 1982, [[redistricting]] forced him to run against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Margaret Heckler]], who represented a district centered on the [[South Coast (Massachusetts)|South Coast]], including [[Fall River, Massachusetts|Fall River]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. Although the newly configured district retained Frank's district number <U+2014> the 4th <U+2014> it was geographically more Heckler's district. Frank focused on Heckler's initial support for President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s tax cuts, and won by twenty percentage points. He has not faced significant opposition since, and has been reelected fifteen times.<ref name=Advocate /><ref name=Advocate2>{{cite web|author=Benoit Denizet-Lewis, with photographs by Henry Leutwyler|url= http://www.advocate.com/issue_story_ektid67124.asp |title=Harrumph!

====LGBT issues====

Frank has been outspoken on many [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] issues, including [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights]].

I'm a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] gay Jew. I've never felt, automatically, a member of any majority." In 1995, then-Republican [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] famously referred to Frank as "Barney [[faggot (slang)|Fag]]" in a press interview. Armey apologized and said it was "a slip of the tongue". Frank did not accept Armey's explanation, saying "I turned to my own expert, my mother, who reports that in 59 years of marriage, no one ever introduced her as Elsie Fag."<ref>{{Cite news| last =Rich| first =Frank| author-link =Frank Rich | title =Journal; Closet Clout | newspaper =[[The New York Times]]| date= February 2, 1995| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DF113AF931A35751C0A963958260| postscript =<!--None-->}}</ref> In 1998, Frank founded the [[National Stonewall Democrats]], the national LGBT Democratic organization.

In 2006, Frank and incoming [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] were accused by Rep. [[John Hostettler]] (R-[[Indiana|IN]]) of having a "radical [[homosexual agenda]]"; Frank responded "I do have things I would like to see adopted on behalf of LGBT people: they include the [[same-sex marriage in the United States|right to marry the individual of our choice]]; the [[Don't ask, don't tell|right to serve in the military]] to defend our country; and the [[employment discrimination law in the United States|right to a job based solely on our own qualifications]].<ref name=Toobin>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/01/12/090112fa_fact_toobin|title=Barney's Great Adventure: The most outspoken man in the House gets some real power|author=Jeffrey Toobin|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref><ref name="RFOTIOPWT"/> I acknowledge that this is an agenda, but I do not think that any self-respecting [[Political radicalism|radical]] in history would have considered advocating people's rights to get married, join the army, and earn a living as a terribly inspiring [[revolutionary]] platform."<ref name="RFOTIOPWT">{{cite web |title=News Release from Barney Frank |publisher=United States House of Representatives |date=March 4, 2008 }} {{wayback |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080801144133/http://www.house.gov/frank/antidiscriminationmarch2008.html |date=20080801144133}}</ref> Frank's stance on [[outing]] gay Republicans has been called the "Frank Rule" whereby a [[closeted]] person who uses their power, position, or notoriety to hurt [[LGBT]] people can be outed.<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/ink/04/44/news-ireland.php THE OUTING | David Dreier and his straight hypocrisy]</ref> The issue became relevant during the [[Mark Foley scandal]] of 2006, during which Frank clarified his position on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'': "I think there's a [[Privacy law|right to privacy]].

In 2006, Frank was one of three Representatives to oppose the [[Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act]], which restricted protests (notably those of [[Fred Phelps]]' [[Westboro Baptist Church]]) at soldiers' funerals. He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on [[civil liberties]] and [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] grounds. Frank said of the vote, "I think it<U+2019>s very likely to be found unconstitutional.  It<U+2019>s true that when you defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when you let them provoke you into overdoing it.

====Online gambling====

Frank has partnered with [[Ron Paul]] in support of online gambling rights. In 2006, both strongly opposed H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act, and H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777]</ref><ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411]</ref> To restore online gambling rights, in 2007 Frank sponsored H.R. 2046, the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:h2046: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 2046]</ref>  This bill would have established licensing and regulation of online gaming sites.

In 2008, he and Paul introduced H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act, a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[SAFE Port Act|Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling".

In 1996 Frank co-sponsored the "Federal Law Enforcement Dependents Assistance Act" (H.R.4111.

"The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself.

==House Financial Services Committee==

===Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac===

In 2003, while the ranking Democrat on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Financial Services Committee]], Frank opposed a [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] proposal, in response to accounting scandals, for transferring oversight of [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] from Congress and the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to a new agency that would be created within the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].  The proposal, supported by the head of Fannie Mae, reflected the administration's belief that Congress "neither has the tools, nor the stature" for adequate oversight.  Frank stated, "These two entities...are not facing any kind of financial crisis.... The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of [[affordable housing]]."<ref name="query.nytimes.com">{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D6123BF932A2575AC0A9659C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all |title=New Agency Proposed to Oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae <U+2013> New York Times |publisher=Query.nytimes.com |author=Stephen Labaton |date=Published: September 11, 2003 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> In 2003, Frank also stated what has been called his "famous dice roll":<ref>{{cite news |title=The Fannie Mae Dice Roll Continues |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=11 November 2009 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704402404574527440083580698.html |accessdate=13 December 2009}}</ref> "I do not want the same kind of focus on safety and soundness [in the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] that we have in the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] and the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]].

Frank was criticized by [[Conservatism|conservative organizations]] for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008. [[Bill Sammon]], the Washington managing editor for [[Fox News]], claimed the donations from Fannie and Freddie influenced his support of their lending programs, and said that Frank did not play a strong enough role in reforming the institutions in the years leading up to the [[Late-2000s recession|Economic crisis of 2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,432501,00.html |title=FOXNews.com <U+2013> Lawmaker Accused of Fannie Mae Conflict of Interest <U+2013> Politics &#124; Republican Party &#124; Democratic Party &#124; Political Spectrum |publisher=Foxnews.com |author=Bill Sammon |date=October 3, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}</ref> In 2006 a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/research/200810100022#documented|title=Mediamatters.org <U+2013> Myths and falsehoods about the purported link between affordable housing initiatives and the financial crisis <U+2013> Politics &#124; Republican Party &#124; Democratic Party &#124; Political Spectrum |publisher=mediamatters.org |author=Bill Sammon |date=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> In response to criticism, Frank said, <U+201C>In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people. And I said at the time, <U+2018>Hey<U+2014>(a) this is going to jeopardize their profitability, but (b) it<U+2019>s going to put people in homes they can<U+2019>t afford, and they<U+2019>re gonna lose them.<U+2019><U+201D> <ref name="Toobin"/>

In 2009 Frank responded to what he called "wholly inaccurate efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [me] in particular" for the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], which is linked to the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010#Origins and growth of the housing bubble|financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2009]].<ref name="FSATRA"/> He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican [[Mike Oxley]] that died because of opposition from President Bush.<ref name="FSATRA">[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/financialsvcs_dem/press0312092.shtml Frank Seeks Antidote to Republican Amnesia].</ref> The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. <U+201C>If it had passed, that would have been one of the ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing,<U+201D> Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, [[Lawrence B. Lindsey]], a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank <U+201C>is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters.<U+201D><ref name="Toobin"/> Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.1427: H.R. 1427]) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R.3915: H.R. 3915]) to passage in 2007.<ref name="FSATRA"/> Frank also said that the Republican-led [[Gramm<U+2013>Leach<U+2013>Bliley Act]] of 1999, which repealed part of the [[Glass<U+2013>Steagall Act]] of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown.<ref name="FSATRA"/> Frank further stated that "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [Bush] administration<U+2019>s approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]<U+2019>s desk in July 2008. Moreover, "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and we could have done it much quicker if the [Bush] administration had cooperated."<ref>[http://www.barneyfrank.net/node/208 Congressman Frank's Letter To The Editor Replying To False Republican Accusations Concerning Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac] September 23, 2008.</ref>

During the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], Frank was characterized as "a key deal-maker, an unlikely bridge between his party<U+2019>s [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] base and [...] [[free market]] [[Conservatism|conservative]]s" in the Bush administration.<ref name="ALWBB">{{Cite news |last=Herszenhorn |first=David M. |date=May 13, 2008 |title=A Liberal Wit Builds Bridges to the G.O.P. |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/washington/13barney.html |postscript=<!--None--> }}</ref><ref>[http://firstrunfeatures.com/letsgetfrankdvd.html "Let's Get Frank"] documentary.</ref> [[Henry Paulson|Hank Paulson]], the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] for the Bush administration, said he enjoyed Frank<U+2019>s penchant for brokering deals, "he is looking to get things done and make a difference, he focuses on areas of agreement and tries to build on those."<ref name="ALWBB"/>

''The New York Times'' noted that the [[Federal Housing Administration]]'s crucial role in the nation's housing market, providing low-down-payment mortgages during the crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010 when no mortgages would otherwise have been available, "helped avert full-scale disaster" by helping people purchase or refinance homes and thereby putting a floor under falling home prices. However, due to the tighter flow of credit from the banks, total FHA loans in 2009 were four times that of 2006, raising concern that year that if the economy were to dip back into recession, more Fed funds could be required to keep those loans afloat.  Frank's response was that the additional defaults<U+2014>2.2% more of the total portfolio in 2009 than the year before<U+2014>were worth the economic stabilization of the broader policy, noting "It was an effort to keep prices from falling too fast."  In that context, he opined, "I don't think it's a bad thing that the bad loans occurred."  In fact, the unprecedented number of loans made since 2008 were noted to be performing far better than those in the prior two years.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/business/09fha.html?pagewanted=2&_r=2 F.H.A.

==Personal life==

According to Stuart Weisberg's 2009 biography ''Barney Frank: The Story of America's Only Left-Handed, Gay, Jewish Congressman'', Frank dated women in an effort to deny his homosexuality. His last romance with a woman was a nearly two-year long affair with Irish-American Catholic Kathleen Sullivan, the daughter of [[New England Patriots]] owner [[Billy Sullivan]], that began in 1974. When the two split up, at Frank's instigation, he admitted to her that he was gay. He was still closeted publicly.

According to Frank, he "realized it was crazy" to try to have a romance with someone he cared for but was not compatible with due to his homosexuality. "That was the last effort to avoid being gay," Weisber quotes Frank as saying. Frank never again dated a woman.

Frank started [[coming out]] as [[gay]] to friends before he ran for Congress and came out publicly in 1987, "prompted in part by increased media interest in his private life<U+2026>" and the death of [[Stewart McKinney (politician)|Stewart McKinney]], "a [[closeted]] bisexual Republican representative from Connecticut"; Frank told ''The Washington Post'' after McKinney's death there was <U+201C>An unfortunate debate about 'Was he or wasn't he?
