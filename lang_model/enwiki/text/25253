The '''Russian ironclad ''Ne Tron Menia''''' was the second of the three {{sclass|Pervenets|ironclad|0}} [[Ironclad warship#Broadside_ironclads|broadside ironclads]] built for the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] during the mid-1860s. She joined the [[Baltic Fleet]] upon completion and never left Russian waters. Beginning in 1870 the ship was assigned to the Gunnery Training Detachment and was frequently rearmed. ''Ne Tron Menia'' was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] and [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed a decade later. In 1905 the ship was disarmed and she was sold in 1908. After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]], she was acquired by the Soviets before being sold to a factory in 1925. The ship was sunk during the [[Siege of Leningrad]] during [[World War II]] and was [[ship breaking|scrapped]] after she was [[marine salvage|salvaged]] in 1950.

==Design and description==
The ship was designed as a [[Coastal defence ship|coast defense]] vessel to protect the approaches to [[Saint Petersburg]] and was referred to as a "self-propelled armored [[floating battery]]". As such a heavy armament and protection were the most important factors in the ship's design. ''Ne Tron Menia'' means ''Touch Me Not'' and refers to the Biblical verse, John 20:17.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 115, 127</ref>

''Ne Tron Menia'' was {{convert|220|ft|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|53|ft|m|1}} and a designed [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|14|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She displaced {{convert|3340|LT|t}} and her iron [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] had a pronounced [[tumblehome]]. She was fitted with large [[naval ram|rams]] at [[bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]]; the stern ram also serving to protect her [[rudder]] and [[propeller]].<ref name=m7>McLaughlin, p. 117</ref> The ship did not steer well and had "an unpredictable habit of suddenly lurching to one side or another", probably as a result of poor water flow to the rudder. ''Ne Tron Menia'' required six men to man her [[Ship's wheel|wheel]]<ref name=m9>McLaughlin, p. 119</ref> and her total crew numbered 459 officers and men.<ref name=m7/>

She received the refurbished engine from the steam [[ship of the line]] {{ship|Russian ship of the line|Konstantin||2}} as a cost-cutting measure, originally intended for her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|Russian ironclad|Pervenets||2}}. This was probably a [[Marine steam engine#Direct acting|direct-acting steam engine]] and was built by the British firm of [[Humphrys & Tennant]]. Steam was provided by four rectangular [[fire-tube boiler]]s. During [[sea trial]]s on 18 July 1865, the engine produced a total of {{convert|1200|ihp}} and gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|7.75|-|8|kn|lk=on}}. She carried a maximum of {{convert|500|LT|t}} of coal, but her endurance is unknown. ''Ne Tron Menia'' was [[schooner]]-rigged with three iron [[mast (sailing)|mast]]s. Under a combination of sail and steam the ship could reach a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 117, 124<U+2013>26</ref>

''Ne Tron Menia'' was completed with seventeen {{convert|8|in|0|adj=on}} [[Rifling|rifled]] guns. Fifteen were mounted on the [[broadside]] on the main deck and two guns were placed in [[pivot gun|pivot mounts]] on the upper deck to serve as [[chase gun]]s. One of the main deck guns was removed and a {{convert|7.72|in|adj=on|0}} 60-pounder [[smoothbore]] gun was added on the upper deck in 1868.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 120, 122</ref> 

Unlike ''Pervenets'', the ship's [[tumblehome]] of 27<U+00B0>, intended to deflect shells, began above the [[waterline]] so the narrow vertical strake of wrought iron armor at the waterline was increased to a thickness of {{convert|5.5|in|0}} in compensation for its reduced protective abilities. The rest of the ship's side was protected with 4.5 inches of armor that reduced to {{convert|4|in|0}} beginning {{convert|30|ft|m|1}} from the ship's ends. It backed by {{convert|10|in|0}} of teak and extended {{convert|4|ft|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. The ship's hull was divided by six watertight transverse and two longitudinal [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s for protection against underwater damage. The open-topped [[conning tower]] was also protected by 4.5 inches of armor.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 122, 124</ref>

==Service==
''Ne Tron Menia'' was ordered on 31 May 1862 when a contract was signed with the British shipbuilder [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]. The total price of the ship was 923,500 rubles. The state-owned [[Admiralty Shipyard|Galerniy Island Shipyard]] in Saint Petersburg was leased to Mitchell and the Naval Ministry agreed to upgrade the facilities to handle iron-hulled, [[ironclad warships]]. The construction of a new [[slipway]] large enough to handle the ship delayed the start of construction until 30 January 1863 and the delay allowed the design to be modified to handle larger and more powerful eight-inch rifles about to enter service. These guns required more room to operate than the older, ineffectual smoothbore guns, so the main deck was slightly widened by raising the point at which the hull's tumblehome began. Based on the experiences with her sister, bilge keels {{convert|12|in|0}} deep and {{convert|20|ft|1}} were fitted to reduce the ship's rolling. ''Ne Tron Menia'' was not formally [[Keel|laid down]] until 1 December 1863 and she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 23 June 1864.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 115<U+2013>16, 119</ref>

The ship entered service on 18 July 1865 with the Baltic Fleet. She collided with the [[armored frigate]] {{ship|Russian ironclad|Petropavlovsk||2}} in July 1869, and was frequently assigned to the Gunnery Training Detachment after 1870. As part of this formation, ''Ne Tron Menia''  was frequently rearmed to train officers and men on some of the latest guns to enter service. In 1880 she mounted a dozen 8-inch on her gun deck. On her upper deck, sometimes mounted on platforms that extended over her [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#B|bulwarks]], were a {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], a {{convert|3.42|in|adj=on|0}} four-pounder, four-barreled gun, a {{convert|1.75|in|adj=on|0}} Engstrem gun, and a {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} [[Helge Palmcrantz|Palmcrantz]] [[auto-cannon]]. The mortar was removed in 1881 as it strained the ship's structure.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 120, 122</ref>

To alleviate the cramped conditions of the steersmen, the ship's wheel was transferred from the gun deck to a platform that spanned her bulwarks in front of the mizzenmast in 1871. The conning tower was removed 1876<U+2013>77 and new boilers were installed. These increased the engine's power to {{convert|1700|ihp}} and ''Ne Tron Menia'' reached 8.5 knots on sea trials. In 1883, she [[naval ram|rammed]] the Norwegian ship ''Heiden'' in 1882 and the ship was placed in reserve three years later. She was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and was hulked on 23 March 1895. ''Ne Tron Menia'' served with the Mine School at Kronstadt before she was disarmed on 15 September 1905 and stricken from the [[Navy List]] on 11 October 1905. Turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal, she was sold on 8 September 1908 to be used as a barge. ''Ne Tron Menia'' was acquired by the Soviets after the Russian Civil War and then sold to the [[Leningrad Metal Works]] on 24 June 1925. During World War II, she was sunk in the [[Neva River]]. She was raised in 1950 and subsequently scrapped.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 124, 126<U+2013>27</ref>
