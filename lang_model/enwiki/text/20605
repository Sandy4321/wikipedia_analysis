'''State Route 78''' (SR 78) is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]] in the [[United States]] (U.S.) that runs from [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] east to [[Blythe, California|Blythe]], traversing the entire width of the state. Its western terminus is at [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] (I-5) in [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] and its eastern terminus is at [[Interstate 10 (California)|I-10]] in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]]. The route is a freeway through the heavily populated cities of northern San Diego County and a two-lane highway running through the [[Santa Rosa Mountains (California)|Santa Rosa Mountains]] to [[Julian, California|Julian]]. In [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]] SR 78 travels through the desert near the [[Salton Sea]] and passes through the city of [[Brawley, California|Brawley]] before turning north and passing through an area of sand dunes on the way to its terminus in Blythe.

SR 78 was one of the original state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of [[Brawley, California|Brawley]] until 1959. The freeway section in the [[San Diego North County, California|North County]] of [[San Diego]] that connects Oceanside and [[Escondido, California|Escondido]] was built in the middle of the twentieth century in several stages, including a transitory stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in that region. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley is also under construction.

==Route description==
State Route 78 is designated as [[Ronald Packard]] Parkway (after a former [[Congressman]] from the area) from I-5 in the city of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] to [[Interstate 15 in California|I-15]] in the city of [[Escondido, California|Escondido]],<ref name="sdut">{{cite news|first=Logan|last=Jenkins|title=Political heritage precedes hopefuls for 74th|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/jenkins/20060427-9999-1mi27jenkins.html|work=The San Diego Union-Tribune|publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Company|date=April 27, 2006|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> and [[Ben Hulse]] Highway (after a former [[California Senate|state senator]]) from [[SR 86 (CA)|SR 86]] near Brawley to I-10 near the city of [[Blythe, California|Blythe]].<ref name="pe">{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Miller|title=Bill would reassign highway-naming duties to Caltrans|url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/transportation/stories/PE_News_Local_D_names17.3f7c1a9.html|work=The Press-Enterprise|publisher=Press-Enterprise Company|date=May 16, 2007|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> The portion of SR 78 from SR 86 in Brawley to [[County Route S3 (California)|County Route S3]] (CR S3) near [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] is designated as part of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail]] auto tour route, promoted by the [[National Park Service]].<ref name="NPSSD">{{cite web|url=http://www.solideas.com/DeAnza/TrailGuide/San_Diego/index.html|title=Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail Guide: San Diego County|publisher= National Park Service|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref><ref name="NPSImp">{{cite web|url=http://www.solideas.com/DeAnza/TrailGuide/Imperial/index.html|title=Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail Guide: Imperial County|publisher= National Park Service|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> SR 78 is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]],<ref name="cafes">{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=shc&group=00001-01000&file=250-257|title=CA Codes (shc:250-257)|publisher= California State Legislature|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> although only the metropolitan section of SR 78 is a [[freeway]].

State Route 78 begins in Oceanside as a continuation of Vista Way. As it encounters a traffic signal and crosses over I-5, the route becomes a suburban freeway traveling east through Oceanside.<ref name="SANDAGts">{{cite web|url=http://www.sandag.org/uploads/publicationid/publicationid_995_4463.pdf|format=PDF|title=I-5/SR-78 Interchange Improvements Fact Sheet|publisher= San Diego Association of Governments|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> The freeway loosely parallels Buena Vista Creek before entering the city of [[Vista, California|Vista]]. The freeway then turns southeast, continuing into the city of [[San Marcos, California|San Marcos]] near [[California State University San Marcos]] and entering Escondido, where it has an interchange with [[Interstate 15 (California)|I-15]]. After passing the Center City Parkway ([[Interstate 15 Business (Escondido, California)|I-15 Business]]) interchange, the freeway abruptly ends at the intersection with Broadway. SR 78 then makes a turn south onto Broadway and continues through downtown Escondido by turning east onto Washington Street and south onto Ash Street, which becomes San Pasqual Valley Road.<ref name="tgsd" />

[[Image:CASR78atS14.jpg|thumb|right|State Route 78 in Oceanside at El Camino Real overpass]]
Turning east once again, SR 78 leaves the Escondido city limits and enters the [[San Pasqual Valley]] as it provides access to the [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]] and [[Battle of San Pasqual|San Pasqual Battlefield State Park]]. After leaving the San Pasqual Valley, the road follows a serpentine alignment, heading south to enter the community of [[Ramona, California|Ramona]] as Pine Street. In Ramona, SR 78 intersects [[State Route 67 (California)|SR 67]] and makes a turn east onto Main Street, going through downtown Ramona. The highway leaves Ramona as Julian Road, which continues on a winding mountain alignment through [[Witch Creek, California|Witch Creek]] to [[Santa Ysabel, California|Santa Ysabel]] where it meets State Route 79. SR 78 runs concurrently with SR 79 across the headwaters of the [[San Diego River]] and through the hamlet of [[Wynola, California|Wynola]], briefly entering [[Cleveland National Forest]] before reaching [[Julian, California|Julian]] as Washington Street. SR 78, still concurrent with SR 79, turns east onto Main Street and travesl through downtown Julian before SR 79 diverges south towards [[Cuyamaca, California|Cuyamaca]] and SR 78 heads northeast as Banner Road. The road intersects with [[County Route S2 (California)|County Route S2]] (CR S2) in what is known as Scissors Crossing; the junction's name refers to the shape of the interchange as CR S2 runs concurrently in a [[Concurrency (road)#Wrong-way concurrency|wrong-way concurrency]]. Shortly afterwards, SR 78 enters Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and is designated as a scenic highway for its length in the state park. Although this route travels many miles south of the town of [[Borrego Springs, California|Borrego Springs]], it provides access to the town via CR S3. SR 78 travels through the town of [[Ocotillo Wells, California|Ocotillo Wells]] before exiting the state park and entering [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]].<ref name="tgsd" />

In Imperial County, State Route 78 intersects with State Route 86, running concurrently with it southwest of the [[Salton Sea]] and northwest of San Felipe Creek. SR 78 passes through the desert community of [[Elmore Desert Ranch, California|Elmore Desert Ranch]] before entering the city of [[Westmorland, California|Westmorland]]. SR 78, still concurrent with SR 86, enters into the city of [[Brawley, California|Brawley]] as Main Street, where SR 86 splits off to the south towards [[El Centro, California|El Centro]]. After going through downtown for several blocks, the highway intersects with [[SR 111 (CA)|SR 111]] and runs concurrently with it for about a mile, where SR 111 turns south again. SR 78 then intersects with [[SR 115 (CA)|SR 115]] east of Brawley, running concurrently with it as well for a brief distance. Shortly after passing through the small community of [[Glamis, California|Glamis]], the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the [[Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range|Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve]]. As it nears the [[Colorado River]] and the [[Arizona]] border, SR 78 briefly passes through [[Cibola National Wildlife Refuge]] before entering the community of [[Palo Verde, California|Palo Verde]], where the river turns away from the highway and SR 78 enters [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]].<ref name="tgsd">{{Cite map| publisher=Thomas Brothers| title=San Diego County Street Atlas| year=2009}}</ref>

As it nears Blythe, the highway makes a sharp turn east onto 32nd Avenue before turning north on Rannels Boulevard. It makes a right on 28th Avenue before turning north on Washington Boulevard and passing through [[Ripley, California|Ripley]]. SR 78 continues north for a few more miles to its terminus at [[I-10 (CA)|I-10]] a few miles west of Blythe.<ref name="tgriv">{{Cite map| publisher=Thomas Brothers| title=Riverside County Street Atlas| year=2009}}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
Before the designation of SR 78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed around 1900. This road roughly followed the current routing of SR 78 from Escondido to the east of Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley.<ref name="1900map">{{cite map|publisher=West Coast Map Company|year=circa 1900|title=Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway Map and Information|scale=1"=7 miles}}</ref><ref name="1919map" />

No road connected Brawley with Glamis at this time; it was necessary to travel north through [[Calipatria, California|Calipatria]] to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing by Smith Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the routing of SR 78.<ref name="1919map">{{cite map|publisher=Automobile Club of Southern California|year=1919|title=Automobile Road Map Touring Imperial County, California|scale=1"=5 miles}}</ref> Around the 1930s, the road from Escondido to Ramona was a gravel road, and the portion from Julian to [[U.S. Route 99]] (US 99), which is currently designated as SR 86, was a dirt road.<ref name="1932map">{{cite map|year=1932|title=California and Nevada|publisher=Texaco|cartography=Rand McNally & Company|scale=1"=25 miles}}</ref>

SR 78 was originally formed along with the originally signed state highways in California (Sign Routes) in 1934; however, it only extended to what was then US 99 near [[Kane Springs, California|Kane Springs]].<ref name="GBC">{{cite web|author=[[California Division of Highways]]|url=http://www.gbcnet.com/roads/ca_routes_1934.html|title=State Routes will be Numbered and Marked by Distinctive Bear Signs|publisher=GBCnet.com|year=1934|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> In the North County, SR 78 was legislatively designated as Legislative Route 196 from then-[[US 101 (CA)|US 101]] (present-day I-5) to Vista, and as Legislative Route 77 from Vista to [[U.S. Route 395 (California)|U.S. Route 395]] in Escondido. SR 78 was legally known as Legislative Route 197 from Escondido to Ramona, and Legislative Route 198 from Ramona to US 99, which is now SR 86. From US 99 in Brawley to SR 115, SR 78 was defined as Legislative Route 187.<ref name="CAstat1933">{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767}}</ref>

===Construction===

[[Image:CA78histmap.jpg|thumb|right|State Route 78 in 1947 before the freeway was built]]
During the 1940s, US 395 ran concurrently along the portion of SR 78 from Vista to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s. At this time, all of SR 78 that existed had been paved.<ref name="1947map">{{cite map|year=1947|title=California Points of Interest and Touring Map|publisher=RPM Motor Oil|catrography=The H.M. Gousha Company}}</ref>

Before the present-day freeway was built, SR 78 was routed on the Vista Way Freeway (which was an expressway) from Oceanside east to downtown Vista. After this, it followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east (now signed as [[County Route S14 (California)|CR S14]]), continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido. After intersecting US 395, SR 78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway.<ref name="1959map">{{cite map|publisher=Thomas Brothers Maps|year=1959|title=Street Map of San Diego and Vicinity}}</ref>

The Vista Way Freeway opened in April 1962 between I-5 and Melrose Drive, but was not entirely [[grade-separated]].<ref name="centersec" /><ref name="1962map">{{cite map|publisher=Texaco|year=1962|title=California}}</ref> The first section of the SR 78 freeway from San Marcos to west of Vista was completed in early 1963, at a cost of [[USD|$]]3.9&nbsp;million (about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|3900000|1963|r=2}}}} today).<ref name="centersec">{{cite news|title=Vista Area Expressway Progresses|format=Microfilm|work=The San Diego Union|publisher=Copley Press|date=November 19, 1962|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> The rest of the freeway between San Marcos and Escondido was constructed between 1963 and 1968.<ref name="1968map2">{{cite map|publisher=Shell Oil Company|title=San Diego, Southern California, Mexico|year=1968}}</ref> The section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.<ref name="1973map">{{cite map|publisher=Rand McNally|title=San Diego|year=1973}}</ref> The College Boulevard [[diamond interchange]] on this western segment opened to traffic on October 24, 1967, and functioned to connect the recently opened [[MiraCosta College]] to the freeway. The interchange, previously an [[at-grade intersection]], improved traffic flow to the college. The construction of the interchange cost $800,941 at the time (about ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|800941|1967|r=2}}}} today).<ref name="1967sdu">{{cite news|title=MiraCosta Interchange Nearly Ready|format=Microfilm|work=The San Diego Union|publisher=Copley Press|date=September 24, 1967|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref>

The missing portions of the current SR 78 routing in Imperial County were constructed after 1963, when the state legislature allowed for a road to be built from SR 115 to the Riverside County line.<ref name="1963stat">{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385}}</ref> This portion of the road was specifically designed to address the challenges of building it through sand dunes.

In 1969, plans to extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway interchange through Escondido were delayed by [[Caltrans]] director Jacob Dekema due to a lack of funding; however, these plans fell through, as the bypass does not exist today.<ref name="1969sdu">{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Brown|title=Dekema Sees Road Delays at Escondido|format=Microfilm|work=The San Diego Union|publisher=Copley Press|date=January 16, 1969|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}</ref> Finally, in 1971, the entire routing of SR 78 as it is today began to appear on highway maps.<ref name="1971AOL">{{cite map|year=1971|publisher=American Oil Company|title=California|cartography=Diversified Map Corporation|scale=1"=28 miles}}</ref>

===Following initial construction===

During the last decade, several significant improvements have been made to SR 78 in the North County. A new interchange with Vista Village Drive was opened in 1998, and the College Boulevard interchange in Oceanside was revised along westbound SR 78. In addition to this, a new interchange was constructed at Las Posas Road in San Marcos, which opened in 2006.<ref name="Caltransfact" /><ref name="NCTimes2">{{cite news|first=David|last=Garrick|title=Las Posas interchange getting rave reviews|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/06/24/news/inland/62307181950.txt|work=The North County Times|publisher=Lee Enterprises|date=June 23, 2007|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref>

In the Imperial and Riverside County portion from Brawley to Blythe, the road goes through several [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]]. During the [[monsoon]] season, these washes can be left with several inches of water, sand, and rock [[Debris#Meteorological|debris]] following rainstorms.
