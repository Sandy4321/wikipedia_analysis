A '''hot dog''' is a type of fully-cooked sausage in bread, [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] and sometimes [[Smoking (cooking technique)|smoked]] [[sausage]] of even texture and flavor that is softer and  moister than most other sausages. It is the sausage most readily eaten as [[finger food]], especially in the [[United States]]. It is usually placed hot in a soft, sliced bun of the same shape as the sausage, and optionally includes [[condiment]]s and toppings. The resulting [[sandwich]] is also called a '''hot dog'''.

The flavor of hot dog sausages varies widely by region and by personal preference, as do the toppings on the sandwich. The flavor of the sausage itself can resemble a range of similar meat products from [[bologna sausage|bologna]] on the bland side to [[salami|cooked salami]] in the spicier varieties.

Hot dogs are traditionally made from [[beef]], [[pork]], or a combination of both meats. Unlike many other sausages (which may be sold cooked or uncooked), hot dogs are always cooked before being offered commercially. Unless they have spoiled, hot dogs may be safely eaten without further cooking though they are usually warmed up before serving. [[Vegetarian hot dog]]s and sausages which are made completely from [[meat analogue]] are also widely available in most areas where hot dogs are popular.  

Hot dogs are also called '''frankfurters''', or '''franks''' for short (named after the city of [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt, Germany]], the original frankfurters are made of pork only), or '''wieners''' or '''weenies''' (named after the city of [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]], whose German name is "Wien", the original wieners are made of a mixture of pork and beef). In Australia, the term ''frankfurt'' is used rather than ''frankfurter''. Tiny frankfurts, called ''cocktail franks'' or ''cheerios'', {{Fact|date=April 2007}} are sometimes served at parties and eaten on the end of a toothpick. In the [[German language|German]] speaking countries, except [[Austria]], hot dog sausages are generally called '''Wiener''' or '''Wiener W<U+00FC>rstchen.''' (''W<U+00FC>rstchen'' means "little sausage") In [[Swiss German]], it is  called ''Wienerli''; but, in Austria, the terms '''Frankfurter''' or '''Frankfurter W<U+00FC>rstchen''' are used.

== History ==

[[Image:Hotdog too.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A "home-cooked" hot dog with [[mayonnaise]], [[onion]], and [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]]-[[relish]]]] 

Claims of "invention" of the hot dog are difficult to assess, because different stories assert the creation of the sausage itself, the placing of the sausage (or another kind of sausage) on bread or a bun as finger food, the mass popularization of the existing dish, or the application of the name "hot dog" to a sausage and bun combination.

The city of [[Vienna]] traces the lineage of the hot dog to the ''wienerwurst'' or Viennese sausage, the city of [[Frankfurt]] to the ''frankfurter wurst'', which it claims was invented in the 1480s; the hot dog has also been attributed to Johann Georghehner, a 17th century butcher from the [[Bavaria]]n city of [[Coburg]] who is said to have invented the "dachshund" or "little-dog" sausage and brought it to Frankfurt.<ref>{{harvcolnb|Schmidt|2003|p=241}}</ref>

Around 1870 on [[Coney Island]], a German immigrant named Charles Feltman began selling sausages in rolls.<ref>{{harvcolnb|Immerso|2002|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{harvcolnb|Sterngass|2001|p=239}}</ref>

Others have also been acknowledged for supposedly having "invented" the hot dog, including Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger, a Bavarian sausage seller who is said to have started serving sausages in rolls at the [[World's Fair]]<U+2014>either the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago or the 1904 [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in St Louis<ref>{{harvcolnb|McCullough|2000|p=240}}</ref><U+2014>because the white gloves he gave to customers so that they could eat his hot sausages in comfort began to disappear as souvenirs.<ref name=js>{{harvcolnb|Jakle|Sculle|1999|p=163<U+2013>164}}</ref>

The association between hot dogs and baseball may have began as early as 1893 with [[Chris von der Ahe]], a German immigrant who owned not only the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]], but also an amusement park, beer garden and brewery near [[Sportsman's Park]], where he sold his beer.<ref>{{harvcolnb|McCollough|2006}}:[http://www.coveringsports.com/hotdog.htm Frankfurter, she wrote: Hot dog shrouded in mystery]</ref>

In 1916, an employee of Feltman's named Nathan Handwerker was encouraged by celebrity clients [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] to go into business in competition with his former employer.<ref name=immerso131>{{harvcolnb|Immerso|2002|p=131}}</ref>
Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging ten.<ref name=immerso131/>
At a time when food regulation was in its infancy, and the pedigree of the hot dog particularly suspect, Handwerker made sure that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at [[Nathan's Famous]] in order to reassure potential customers.<ref name=js/>

== Etymology ==

The term "dog" has been used as a synonym for sausage since at least 1884 ('A sausage-maker...is continually dunning us for a motto. The following, we hope, will suit him to a hair: "Love me, love my dog."') and accusations that sausage-makers used dog meat date to at least 1845 ("Dogs...they retails the latter, tails and all, as sassenger meat.")<ref name=wilton>{{harvcolnb|Wilton|2004|pp=58<U+2013>59}}</ref>

According to a popular myth, the use of the complete phrase "''hot'' dog" in reference to sausage was coined by the newspaper cartoonist [[Thomas A. Dorgan|Thomas Aloysius "TAD" Dorgan]] ca. 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] baseball game at the [[Polo Grounds]].<ref name=wilton/>
However, TAD's earliest usage of "hot dog" was not in reference to a baseball game at the Polo Grounds, but to a bicycle race at [[Madison Square Garden]], in the December 12 and December 13, 1906 editions of ''[[New York Journal American|The New York Evening Journal]]'' dated December 12, 1906, by which time the term "hot dog" in reference to sausage was already in use.<ref name=popik>{{harvcolnb|Popik|2004}}:"[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/hot_dog_polo_grounds_myth_original_monograph/ Hot Dog (Polo Grounds myth & original monograph)]"</ref><ref name=wilton/>

The earliest usage of "hot dog" in clear reference to sausage found by Barry Popik appeared in the 28 September 1893 edition of ''The Knoxville Journal''.<ref name=popik/>{{epigraph | quote =It was so cool last night that the appearance of overcoats was common, and stoves and grates were again brought into comfortable use. Even the weinerwurst men began preparing to get the "hot dogs" ready for sale Saturday night. | cite =28 September 1893, Knoxville (TN) Journal, "The [''sic''] Wore Overcoats," pg. 5}}Another early use of the complete phrase "hot dog" in reference to sausage appeared on page 4 of the October 19, 1895 issue of ''[[The Yale Record]]'': "they contentedly munched hot dogs during the whole service."<ref name=popik/>

==General description==
[[Image:Hotdogs.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Grilled hot dogs]]
A hot dog is typically distinguishable from other sausages by its smaller size and relative lack of spicing. A regular hot dog of the kind popular at sporting events and readily available in supermarkets is roughly 6 inches in length (15 cm), though thickness and length can vary. The mild seasoning and smaller size allows children to eat hot dogs more easily than other sausages.  There are many nationally distributed brands that tend to market similar products to all geographical areas, but many local brands still survive, mostly due to wide variations in regional hot dog preferences.  Twelve-inch (30-cm) or "footlong" hot dogs are popular in some regions, for example.

===Ingredients===
There is no fixed specification for hot dog [[meat]], with pork and beef being the most popular. Less expensive hot dogs typically contain chicken, due to the low cost and availability of [[Mechanically separated poultry|mechanically separated chicken]], and some pork. Hot dogs are generally regarded as unhealthy insofar as most have high [[sodium]], [[fat]] and [[Sausage making#Cures: sodium and potassium nitrite and nitrate|nitrate]] content. In recent years, due to changing dietary preferences in the U.S., manufacturers have turned to [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], chicken, or vegetarian [[meat substitutes]] as well as lowering the salt content.

In general, if a manufacturer produces two different hot dog-type sausages, "wieners" tend to contain pork, and to be the blander of the two, while "franks" tend to be all-beef, and more strongly seasoned. This is particularly true of [[Oscar Mayer]] products.

====Condiments====
[[Image:Hot dog mural.jpg|thumb|200px|right|This wall painting shows some of the more common hot dog condiments: mustard, ketchup and relish.]]
[[Image:coneyhdog.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Detroit]] [[Coney Island hot dog]] with chili, onion and mustard.]]
Throughout the world, there are numerous variations in hot dog condiments from region to region. The most common are [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[ketchup]], [[chili con carne|chili]], [[sauerkraut]], [[cole slaw]], [[relish|pickle relish]] and chopped [[onion]] {{Fact|date=April 2007}}. Others include [[mayonnaise]], chopped [[lettuce]], [[tomato]] (chopped, sliced, or in wedges), [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]] spear, [[celery salt]], [[cheese]], [[avocado]], canned [[corn]], deep-fried [[potato]] sticks, and [[hot pepper]]s, and usually served in a [[hot dog bun|bun]].

In the United States, the [[National Sausage and Hot Dog Council]] conducted a poll in [[2005]], which found mustard the most popular condiment (32 percent). "Twenty-three percent of Americans said they preferred ketchup. [...] Chili came in third at 17 percent, followed by relish (9 percent) and onions (7 percent). Southerners showed the strongest preference for Chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup. Nationwide, however, mustard prevailed."<ref>http://www.hot-dog.org/pr/052505.htm</ref>

Some Americans believe that a properly made hot dog should never be topped with ketchup.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} Often these people believe the flavor of ketchup overpowers and destroys the taste of the hot dog instead of complementing it.<ref>http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_095.html</ref> In [[Chicago]], some restaurants and hot dog stands that consider themselves to be "true" [[Chicago-style hot dog|Chicago hot dog]] grills do not, as a rule, carry ketchup in stock, even if they serve other food items that use this condiment, such as [[French fries]]. The National Hot Dog & Sausage Council, in its tongue-in-cheek recommendations for proper [http://www.hot-dog.org/hotdogetiquette.html Hot Dog Etiquette] capitulate only slightly to the public's general regard for ketchup, saying, "Don't use ketchup on your hot dog after the age of 18." (This alludes to the fact that many children like ketchup on their hot dogs due to the sweet taste, but adults are expected to have a more sophisticated palate).

The [[Coney Island hot dog]], which is topped with a special "coney sauce" (generally a beanless chili), is also a favorite in the [[US Midwest]]. Several restaurants in [[Michigan]] claim to have invented the Coney dog, which is virtually unknown in its namesake [[Coney Island]], [[New York]].

===Commercial preparation===
Hot dogs are typically prepared commercially by mixing all of the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers, if any) in large vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation, assuring a homogeneous product. This mixture is then forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are called "skinless" as opposed to more expensive "natural casing" hot dogs.

====Natural casing hot dogs====
As with virtually all sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing in order to be cooked. Traditionally this casing is made from the thoroughly cleaned [[small intestine]]s of [[sheep]], and are known as "natural casing" hot dogs or frankfurters.<ref name=levine>{{harvcolnb|Levine|2005}}:[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/dining/25dogs.html It's All in How the Dog Is Served]</ref> These kinds of hot dogs are preferred by some for their firmer texture and the "snap" that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten into.<ref name=levine/>

[[Kosher]] hot dogs are not permitted natural casings and are therefore either skinless or have artificial [[collagen]] casings.<ref name=levine/>

====Skinless hot dogs====
[[Image:Hot Dog Toaster.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the more recent developments in hot dog preparation: The hot dog toaster.]]
"Skinless" hot dogs also must use a casing in the cooking process when the product is manufactured, but here the casing is usually a long tube of thin cooking plastic that is completely removed after cooking and before packaging. Skinless hot dogs vary in the texture of the product surface but have a softer "bite" than natural casing hot dogs. Skinless hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size than natural casing hot dogs and less expensive to produce. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Final preparation===
''For a full list of regional differences in hot dog preparation and condiments, see [[Hot dog variations]].''

Hot dogs may be [[Grilling|grilled]], [[steaming|steamed]], [[boiling|boiled]], [[barbequed]], pan fried, deep fried, broiled, microwaved, or eaten cold (most of the sausages themselves are cooked before packaging).

==Availability in the United States==
[[Image:HillbillyHotDogs.jpg|left|thumb|240px|A roadside hot dog stand located near [[Huntington, West Virginia]].]]

In the U.S., along with ballparks, regional restaurants offer hot dogs.

A few chains in the U.S. that offer hot dogs include [[Sonic Drive-In]] and [[Dog n Suds]], who call it a coney; [[Hardee's]] (but not their counterpart [[Carl's Jr.]] on the west coast of the United States, which is ironic due to founder [[Carl Karcher]] having started the Carl's Jr. empire with a hot dog stand); [[Dairy Queen]]; [[Wienerschnitzel]] (originally Der Wienerschnitzel), whose menu focuses on hot dogs; [[The Frankfurter]] in Seattle, Washington; [[Woody's Chicago Style]]; [[Nathan's|Nathan's Famous]], which sponsors the annual [[Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest]]; [[A&W Restaurants|A&W]] and Spike's Junkyard Dogs located in Rhode Island and Boston. [[Krystal]] restaurants in the southeast offer a small hot dog called a Krystal Pup, and [[Fatburger]], located mostly on the west coast of the U.S., offers hot dogs and chili dogs. 

[[Yocco's Hot Dogs]], founded in 1922, maintains six restaurants in the [[Lehigh Valley]] region of [[Pennsylvania]] and is known for its long-standing specialty on hot dogs and various toppings. Given Yocco's strong global popularity, the restaurant also has a mail-order business, providing frozen hot dog bags to customers around the U.S. and the world.  A map of the world in each of their six restaurants marks the thousands of locations in the U.S. and internationally that have ordered Yocco's hot dogs.

[[Casual dining]] restaurants often have a hot dog on their children's menu, but not on the regular menu.  [[Hot dog stand]]s and trucks sell hot dogs and accompaniments, as well as similar products, at street and highway locations.  Convenience stores such as [[Seven-Eleven]] often sell hot dogs that are kept heated on rotating grills; a selection of flavors and sizes is sometimes offered.

[[Walter's Hot Dog]] in Mamaroneck, New York, is one of the nation's oldest independent roadside stands.

[[Pink's Hot Dogs]] is another famous independent stand and is located in Hollywood, California.

==Competitions==
[[Image:60m Hot Dog Akasaka Aug4 06.jpg|thumb|100px|right|The [[World's Longest Hot Dog]] at the Akasaka Prince Hotel]]
Hot Dog's are used in many competitions, including eating competitions and attempts to create world record sized hot dogs. On June 2, 2007, [[Joey Chestnut]] set a new record when he ate 59<U+00BD> hotdogs in 12 minutes   at a Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest qualifier event in Tempe, AZ, breaking the previous record 53<U+00BE>.<ref>http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/more/06/02/hot.dog.record.ap/index.html</ref>


The [[World's Longest Hot Dog]] created was 60m (196.85 ft), and rested within a 60.3m bun. The hot dog was prepared by Shizuoka Meat Producers for the All-Japan Bread Association who baked the bun, and coordinated the event, which included the official measurement for the World Record. The hot dog and bun were the center of a media event in celebration of the Association's 50th anniversary on August 4, 2006, at the Akasaka Prince Hotel, Tokyo, Japan.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhJlmerwRNE</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1H1XvKRzH4</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOaqNrkfDoI</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDPJD-df7E4</ref>

==In popular media==
[[Mickey Mouse]]'s first spoken words were "Hot Dogs!".<ref>http://www.intercot.com/discussion/showthread.php?t=54998</ref>

==Festivals==
The city of [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], [[West Virginia]], hosts the annual West Virginia Hot Dog Festival.<ref>http://www.edarnold.net/hotdog/ West Virginia Hot Dog Festival</ref>
Each year [[Suffolk Downs]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], thousands of people come to the [[Hot Dog Safari]] to contribute money to help people with [[cystic fibrosis]].<ref>http://www.hotdogsafari.com/</ref>  Another future festival possibility comes from a meat market owner in [[DuBois, Pennsylvania]], created a [[peanut butter]] hot dog recipe at the suggestion of the mother of a seven-year-old customer.  The popularity of this invention spread around via the internet, and now the town of DuBois is discussing a "peanut butter hot dog" festival.<ref>http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06162/697385-34.stm</ref>

==Cultural taboos==
In [[Discordianism]], hot dog buns are considered taboo because of the "Original Snub" as depicted in the [[Principia Discordia]].
