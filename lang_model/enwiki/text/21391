'''Henry Fitz''' was a notable [[United States|American]] telescope manufacturer.<ref name ="abrahams"> Abrahams, Vol. 6</ref> 

==Early life==

Fitz was born in 1808 in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. The family moved to [[Albany, New York]], some eleven years later and to [[New York City]] later on. Fitz as a boy was already very interested in science and mechanics. He initially learned the printing trade from his father. They printed the religious weekly publication called "The Gospel Herald". With his mechanical ability he learned the locksmith trade. One of his many hobbies he enjoyed was astronomy. In the 1830s Fitz was already well-known as an amateur astronomer when he was a boy. His first telescope was made using a lens from a pair of eyeglasses when he was fifteen years old.<ref name ="abrahams"/> 

==Mid life==

Fitz knew [[Alexander Wolcott]], who was working on a speculum mirror for a Cassegrain reflector in the early 1830s. Fitz was able to obtain the half-finished blank that Wolcott had done. He then completed the mirror in 1837 to make a telescope.<ref name ="abrahams"/>

Fitz traveled to Europe from August to November of 1839 learning astronomical and photographic optics. He learned the French were the best makers of high quality glass. The English and German [[optician]]s taught Fitz the techniques of sawing and grinding glass. By the 1840s Fitz had turned his amateur astronomer hobby into a successful business building telescopes.<ref name ="abrahams"/> 

Fitz pioneered techniques of correcting poor quality glass which made him one of the first important American telescope makers. He was the first American to make ''very large'' professional [[refracting telescope]]s.<ref> The Observatory, ''Henry Fitz, of New York, is credited with being the first American who obtained special distinction for the manufacture of refractors; he constructed 30 with object-glasses varying from 6 to 16 inches in diameter.''</ref> Fitz made the largest refractory telescopes in [[United States|America]], five different times.<ref> Abrahams, ''Fitz was the first important American telescope maker because his pioneering techniques of local correction of poor quality glass allowed him to construct the largest American made refractor on five different occasions.''</ref>

Fitz made forty percent of all the United States telescopes sold from 1840 to 1855. He also manufactured eighty percent of all [[astronomical]] telescopes made in the United States at this time. Manufacturing locally in the United States instead of Europe was an important factor in the proliferation of observatories in the nineteenth century in America.<ref name ="abrahams"/>

Fitz contributed considerably in the development of [[astronomical photography]]. Making telescopes and related astronomical components was a labor of love for him. Often he would be found working after midnight. He was the best known American maker of telescopes and [[achromatic]] instruments before the Civil War.<ref> Lankford, p. 211 </ref>

Fitz was in partnership with Wolcott and developed a patented [[Daguerrotype]] camera. They had a photographic studio in Baltimore in 1841. Fitz invented and built foot power machines for the grinding of lenses. He also had employees do all the other tasks involved and trained them accordingly in the process of making lenes and mirrors. The critical final mirror polishing he did himself, however, and did not allow his employees to do that. Fitz made a six inch refractor telescope in 1845 for the American Institute Fair of which he received a gold medal.<ref name ="abrahams"/>

The [[South Carolina College]] at Columbia in 1851 bought a 6 3/8 inch telescope form Fitz for $1,200.  The telescope was used by the college for the next decade. After the Civil War it was stolen for scrap brass. The
[[Haverford College]] in Pennsylvania purchased an eight inch refractor telescope from Fitz in 1852. The [[West Point Academy]] purchased from Fitz in 1856 a 9 3/4 inch refractor telescope costing $5,000.<ref name ="abrahams"/>

==Later life and death==
After his death his wife recalls Fitz making doublet lenses, with the flint element ground from the bottom 
of a tumbler and the crown element made from plate glass. The original workshop of Fitz<U+2019>s is now in storage at the U.S. National Museum of American History.<ref name ="abrahams"/>

Fitz<U+2019>s telescope business was successful, so in 1863 he was in the process of building a new house. Fitz, however, died suddendly at the end of the year. Some have reported that the cause was when a large chandelier fell from the ceiling of his new home. Obituaries report, however, his demise was from [[tuberculosis]].<ref name ="abrahams"/>
