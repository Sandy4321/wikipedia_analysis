'''''Community''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[comedy]] series currently airing on [[NBC]] about students at a [[community college]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. The series premiered on September 17, 2009, and currently airs in the 8:00 pm ET time slot.<ref>{{cite news | author=Matt Mitovich| title=NBC ANNOUNCES FALL SERIES PREMIERE DATES | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx | work=TV Guide Online | date=25 June 2009 | accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> It was previously in the 9:30 pm ET time slot, beginning with its debut, but later relocated as of the fourth episode.
The show is a joint-venture production between [[Universal Media Studios]] and [[Sony Pictures Television]].
The series [[television pilot|pilot]] premiered on [[Facebook]] where it was viewable for a limited time. It has since been available on [[Amazon Video on Demand]], the video-on-demand service for [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Hulu]].

==Premise==
''Community'' centers on Jeff Winger ([[Joel McHale]]), a suspended lawyer who is back in school after his college degree is deemed invalid by the [[state bar association|State Bar]]. The show focuses on Jeff's experiences attending fictional Greendale Community College in Greendale, [[Colorado]], and the people he meets there. He has an obvious crush on Britta ([[Gillian Jacobs]]), a female student trying to get her life back on track, and receives perplexing life lessons from Pierce ([[Chevy Chase]]), an aged moist-towelette tycoon who has been married seven times.

Supporting characters and study group members include Abed ([[Danny Pudi]]), a film student, Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]), a recently divorced mother attending college for the first time, former high school quarterback Troy ([[Donald Glover]]), and straight-laced nerd Annie ([[Alison Brie]]), who has had an unrequited crush on Troy since high school. Also recurring is unbalanced Spanish instructor Se<U+00F1>or Ben Chang ([[Ken Jeong]]), psychology professor Ian Duncan ([[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]), whom Jeff represented for a DUI, and the overwhelmed Dean Pelton ([[Jim Rash]]), who desperately wants his school to be more like a real university as well as extremely politically correct.

==Cast and characters==
The show revolves around the on-campus exploits of seven students who are connected through their Spanish study group at Greendale Community College.  The series also features several recurring characters who are students and teachers at Greendale.

===Main characters===
*'''Jeff Winger''' ([[Joel McHale]]) who is a snarky, glib lawyer attending Greendale Community College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/community/bios/joel-mchale.shtml|title=Community TV - Joel McHale|date=NBC|publisher=2010-02-16|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> He was a lawyer until the [[Law and government of Colorado|Colorado Bar Association]] found out that he did not get a bachelor's degree from [[Columbia University]] but, in fact, got one that was "less than legitimate" from the country of [[Colombia]]. Jeff returns to college by attending ''Greendale Community College'' as a "deal" with the bar in order to prevent him from being [[disbarred]]. He was born in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], and favorite kind of pizza is four cheese.<ref name="jeff bio" />  Jeff is attracted to fellow student Britta and constantly hits on her, despite her shooting him down constantly.<ref name="jeff bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/campus-connect/jeff-winger.shtml | title=Greendale Community College - Jeff Winger | publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref>

*'''Britta Perry''' ([[Gillian Jacobs]]) who is a twenty-something woman attending Greendale after a somewhat aimless, varied career life. She dropped out of high school and joined the Peace Corps, trying to make a difference until she realized she was flat broke.<ref name="Greendale site">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/|title=Greendale Community College | publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> She then got her G.E.D. and enrolled in Greendale.<ref name="Greendale site" /> She is often the voice of reason within the group. Although she has unceasingly displayed a lack of romantic interest in Jeff, one episode shows she may have recently discovered secret feelings for him.<ref name="britta bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/campus-connect/britta-perry.shtml|title=Greendale Community College - Britta Perry | publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> Britta and Jeff like to think of themselves as the group's mom and dad, and often assume they know what is best for their friends; this dynamic of their relationship is explored in several episodes.

*'''Pierce Hawthorne''' ([[Chevy Chase]]) who is an elderly [[moist towelette]] [[tycoon]] attending Greendale Community College.  He created Hawthorne Wipes, the award-winning moist towelette company.<ref name="Greendale site" /> He is a world traveler, a toastmaster, magician, keyboardist and self-styled hypnotherapist, and considers himself a "quality of life person".<ref name="Greendale site" /> He enrolled in Greendale looking for companionship and popularity, but is held back by his clumsiness and his lack of tact.  He is sometimes disoriented by youth culture while still trying to embrace it.

*'''Abed Nadir''' ([[Danny Pudi]]) who is a pop-culture junkie who aspires to become a director and is currently taking film directing classes at Greendale Community College.<ref name="Greendale site" /> His original plan was to take business classes at Greendale to eventually help run his father's falafel restaurant, but this became his backup plan when Britta inspired him to switch professions.<ref name="Greendale site" /> He has emotion and sympathy for his new friends, but speaks with a rather detached and emotionless tone. Despite his odd social behavior, Abed seems to glean certain insights on life by comparing his life to various television shows and movies. He even openly references the [[fourth wall]], by referencing the dynamic of the characters in relation to the show, and can sometimes even predict what each of them will do that day. He also possesses many hidden talents that usually go overlooked. Abed and Troy share an unusually close bond, leading others in the group to comment on their "weird little relationship"; the two usually close the show during the final credits, usually while hanging out on the library couch. Abed is a [[Palestinian American]].

*'''Shirley Bennett''' ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) who is a recently divorced mother of two who attends Greendale Community College.<ref name="shirley bio" /> Shirley is a devoted Christian and is very sweet but also has thinly-veiled rage issues and gossips compulsively. She is proud to be an African American and a woman but appreciates not being defined by those characteristics.<ref name="shirley bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/campus-connect/shirley-bennett.shtml | title=Greendale Community College - Shirley Bennett | publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> She is taking classes which will allow her to market her baked goods, specifically her famous brownies.<ref name="shirley bio" /> She is very friendly to everyone, but sometimes has problems minding her own business or keeping secrets.

*'''Annie Edison''' ([[Alison Brie]]) who is a repressed, straight-laced, [[Jewish]] eighteen-year-old who is in her first year at Greendale Community College.<ref name="annie bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/campus-connect/annie-edison.shtml | title=Greendale Community College - Annie Edison| publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> She lost her college scholarship and dropped out of high school due to an addiction to [[Adderall]]. She likes to think of herself as an "old soul."<ref name="annie bio" /> She used to study obsessively and pine after Troy, on whom she had a crush since high school. She's the most cheerful one of the group and tries to arrange activities.  She is enthusiastic when it comes to helping out the school.

*'''Troy Barnes''' ([[Donald Glover]]) who is a former high school football star who now attends Greendale Community College.<ref name="troy bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/campus-connect/troy-barnes.shtml | title=Greendale Community College - Troy Barnes | publisher = NBC | accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> Born and raised in Greendale, Colorado, Troy made a name for himself as the varsity quarterback of his high school football team, and was also prom king.<ref name="troy bio" /> He rides his bike to class and plays quarterback for the nonathletic Greendale Human Beings.<ref name="troy bio" /> He refers to Abed as "my other half."

*'''Se<U+00F1>or Ben Chang''' ([[Ken Jeong]]) who is the group's unhinged Spanish teacher.<ref name="ken nbc bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/community/bios/ken-jeong.shtml||title=Community TV - Ken Jeong|date=NBC|publisher=2010-02-16|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> He is the only main character who is not a member of the Spanish study group.  He can be quite theatrical at times (once even faking his own death to get a rise out of his students), and also has a ton of ego and anger-management issues.

===Webisodes===
In addition to the regular episodes, NBC produced a series of webisodes, the newest ones are of Abed copying his friends' lives and turning them into student films. These webisodes are featured on the front page of the Greendale Community College website on the AV Department page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greendalecommunitycollege.com/av_dept/|title=AV Department|accessdate=2009-12-28}}</ref>

==Production==
===Casting===
[[Dan Harmon]] emphasized the importance of the cast to making the premise of the comedy work. "Casting was 95 percent of putting the show together," he said in an interview.<ref name="OWH">{{cite news|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20091022/ENTERTAINMENT/710229873|title=Fine writing spurs Chevy to move to <U+2018>Community'|date=2009-09-22|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> He had worked with several of the cast members earlier; Joel McHale, John Oliver, and Chevy Chase all had cameo roles in episode 9 of ''Water and Power'', the short film series produced by Harmon for [[Channel 101]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel101.com/shows/view.php?media_id=2621|title=Water and Power Episode Nine at Channel101.com|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> Actor Chevy Chase had long been a favorite of Harmon. Though principally not very partial to sitcoms, Chase was persuaded to take the job by the quality of the show's writing.<ref name="OWH"/> Harmon saw similarities between Chase and the character he plays on the show. Though Chase has often been ridiculed for his career choices, Harmon believed this role could be redeeming: "What makes Chevy and Pierce heroic is this refusal to stop."<ref name="AV">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/milwaukee/articles/how-dan-harmon-went-from-doing-comedysportz-in-mil,34126/|title=  How Dan Harmon went from doing ComedySportz in Milwaukee to creating NBC's Community|last=Hyden|first=Steven|date=2009-09-19|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> Harmon had to warn Chase against playing a "wise-ass" the way he often does in his roles, since the character of Pierce is a rather pathetic figure who is normally the butt of the joke himself.<ref name="AV"/>

McHale, known from the [[E!]] comedy ''[[The Soup]]'', was also (like Chase) impressed by Harmon's writing. He commented that "after reading Dan's script it was so head and shoulders above everything else that I was reading."<ref name="FB">{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbolt.com/tvinterview.php?id=244|title=Joel McHale & Dan Harmon of Community|last=Loggins|first=Emma|date=2009-10-19|work=Fanbolt|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> McHale appealed to Harmon because of his likeable quality, which allowed the character to possess certain unsympathetic traits without turning the viewer against him.<ref name="AV"/> For the role of Annie, Harmon wanted someone who would resemble [[Tracy Flick]], [[Reese Witherspoon]]'s character from the 1999 movie ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]''. Originally the producers were looking for a Latina or Asian Tracy Flick, for greater diversity, but could not find any. Instead they ended up casting [[Alison Brie]], known from her role as Trudy Campbell on ''[[Mad Men]]''.<ref name="AV"/>

===Development===
The premise of ''Community'' was based on Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his relationship with his then-girlfriend, he enrolled in [[Glendale Community College (California)|Glendale Community College]] northeast of [[Los Angeles]], where they would take Spanish together.<ref name="OWH"/> Harmon got involved in a study group and, somewhat against his own instincts, became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," he explains, "even though they had nothing to do with the film industry and I had nothing to gain from them and nothing to offer them."<ref name="AV"/> With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself.  He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realized the value of connecting with other people.<ref name="AV"/>

About the creative process behind the writing, Harmon says that he had to write the show as if it were a movie, not a sitcom. Essentially, he says, the process was no different from the earlier work he had done, except for the length and the target demographic.<ref name="AV"/>

===Filming===
Filming the show involved a lot of improvisation, particularly from Chevy Chase. About Chase, Harmon said that he "tends to come up with lines that you can actually end scenes with sometimes."<ref name="JE">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/19728/|title=College Daze|last=Elkin|first=Michael|date=2009-10-01|work=[[The Jewish Exponent]]|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref> He also mentioned Joel McHale and Donald Glover, the actor who portrays Troy, as adept improvisers.<ref name="FB"/>

==Reception==
The show's general reviews have been mostly positive, scoring a 69 out of 100 with critics on [[Metacritic]] and a 8.0/10 with viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/community|title=Community reviews at Metacritic.com|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref> Notably, David Bushman (Curator, Television) of the [[Paley Center for Media]] called ''Community'' the best new show of the fall season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/bushman-and-the-best-new-show-of-the-season-is|title=And the Best New Show of the Season Is...|last=Bushman|first=David|date=2009-10-13|publisher=Paley Center|accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

As such, it held 93% of this audience from ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', which had been in the previous time slot. The show was called the "bright spot for the night" for [[NBC]], seeing how ''The Office'' was down 18% from the previous year's premiere, while ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', in the preceding time slot, was down 30%.<ref name="TbtN">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/09/18/tv-ratings-thursday-strong-bones-weak-parks-office-survivor-good-start-community/27540|title=TV Ratings Thursday: Strong: Bones; Weak: Parks, Office, Survivor; Good Start: Community|last=Gorman|first=Bill|date=2009-09-18|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=2009-10-25}}</ref>
