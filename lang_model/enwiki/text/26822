'''Forti Corse''', commonly known as '''Forti''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Auto racing|motor racing]] team chiefly known for its brief, and unsuccessful, involvement in [[Formula One]] in the mid-1990s. It was established in the 1970s and competed in lower formulae for two decades, with some success. The team graduated to F1 as a [[List of Formula One constructors|constructor]] and [[:Category:Formula One entrants|entrant]] in {{F1|1995}} and continued into {{F1|1996}}, before succumbing to financial problems mid-season. The team competed in a total of 27 Grands Prix, scoring no points, and is recognised as one of the last truly privateer teams to race in an era when many large [[List of automobile manufacturers|car manufacturers]] were increasing their involvement in the sport.

==Establishment and early years==
Forti was founded by [[Italy|Italian]] businessmen [[Guido Forti]], a former driver, and [[Paolo Guerci]], an engineer, in the late 1970s<ref name="gpprofile">{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/con-forti.html |title= Constructors: Forti Corse S.R.L.|publisher=grandprix.com|accessdate= 2008-03-14}}</ref> and was based in [[Alessandria]] in northern Italy.<ref name="f1rejects">{{cite web |url=http://www.f1rejects.com/teams/forti/profile.html |title= Forti-Corse - full profile |publisher= f1rejects.com |accessdate= 2006-10-29}}</ref> It was initially run in lower motor racing categories such as [[Formula Ford]] and [[Formula Three]], both at Italian and [[Europe]]an levels. The team was well-equipped and soon became a regular winner. Forti drivers [[Franco Forini]], [[Enrico Bertaggia]], [[Emanuele Naspetti]] and [[Gianni Morbidelli]] (who would all go on to drive in F1) won [[Italian Formula Three Championship|Italian F3]] titles in 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1989 respectively. In addition, Bertaggia won the prestigious [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau F3 Grand Prix]] and the [[List of Monaco Grand Prix Formula Three support race winners|Monaco Grand Prix F3 support race]] in 1988.<ref name="gpprofile"/> Forti also won the [[FIA European Formula Three Cup]] in 1989 with Morbidelli.<ref name=EuroF3Cup>Higham, p.248</ref> [[Teo Fabi]] and [[Oscar Larrauri]] also raced for the team in its formative years, the former winning the Italian FFord 2000 championship as early as 1977, and the latter racing as far afield as [[Formula Three Sudamericana]].<ref name="gpprofile"/>  Forti continued racing in F3 until the end of 1992, when it quit the formula in order to concentrate solely on [[Formula 3000|International Formula 3000]].

==Formula 3000==
For [[1987 Formula 3000 season|1987]], Forti moved up to [[Formula 3000|International Formula 3000]] with less immediate success than experienced in F3.<ref name="gpprofile"/> The main reason for this was the decision on which chassis the team should use to compete with. Instead of using customer [[Lola Racing Cars|Lolas]], [[March Engineering|Marches]] or [[Ralt]]s, all of which were produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their F3 Italian chassis supplier [[Dallara|Gian Paolo Dallara]], who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in [[Formula One]] for the [[BMS Scuderia Italia]] F1 team, as that team's F1 car was not ready for the first race of the {{F1|1988}} season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year. In addition, the team did not attend every race on the schedule.<ref name="gpprofile"/> Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in the following seasons, as did a change to more competitive [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola]] and then [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] chassis.<ref name="gpprofile"/>

[[Image:Noda Formula3000.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hideki Noda]] driving for the Forti [[Formula 3000|International Formula 3000]] team during the [[1994 Formula 3000 season|1994]] season.]]

After a full season in [[1988 Formula 3000 season|1988]] and the team's first championship points courtesy of [[Claudio Langes]] in [[1989 Formula 3000 season|1989]], it became apparent that Forti was improving as a competitive force.  In [[1990 Formula 3000 season|1990]], [[Gianni Morbidelli]] scored Forti's first victory in an F3000 race,<ref name="gpprofile"/> and although no Forti driver won a championship title in this category, the team established itself as a frequent front-runner.<ref name="f1rejects"/> From [[1993 Formula 3000 season|1993]] onwards, Forti concentrated solely on F3000, and ran drivers such as [[Emanuele Naspetti]], [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]], [[Andrea Montermini]] (who would later race for the team in F1) and [[Hideki Noda]] (who would lose out to Montermini for the F1 seat).<ref name="gpprofile"/> This was Forti's most successful season in F3000, with Naspetti finishing third in the Drivers' Championship, only ten points behind champion [[Christian Fittipaldi]]. Although the team's form dipped over subsequent years, by [[1994 Formula 3000 season|1994]] Forti was the most experienced team in the championship, employing Noda and [[Pedro Diniz]] as drivers.  Forti scored nine wins and five [[pole position]]s as an F3000 team.

==Formula One==
===Preparation===
As his team became more successful, Guido Forti started thinking about the next logical move upwards, into [[Formula One]]. However, there had been several discouragingly recent examples of teams which had graduated from F3000 into F1 and failed more or less immediately due to a lack of finance. In preceding years, examples of unsuccessful teams of this nature included [[Enzo Coloni Racing Car Systems|Coloni]] and [[Onyx (racing team)|Onyx]]. But conversely, [[Eddie Jordan]] had shown that the move could be made successfully, with an impressive performance in {{F1|1991}} with his [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]] team, which had finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship with a total of seven finishes in the points. Forti considered a solid financial base to be the most important factor for success. In 1991 he therefore started working on his Formula One project. At the end of {{F1|1992}}, he signed a deal with wealthy [[Brazil|Brazilian]] driver [[Pedro Diniz]], whose personal fortune and sponsorship connections proved invaluable in increasing the team's budget.<ref name="gpprofile"/> Diniz's father, [[Ab<U+00ED>lio dos Santos Diniz|Ab<U+00ED>lio dos Santos]], was the owner of the large Brazilian distribution company [[Companhia Brasileira de Distribui<U+00E7>ao]] and the supermarket chain [[Pao de Acucar (supermarket)|Pao de Acucar]].  By offering companies preferential product-placement in the Brazilian market, the Diniz family was able to obtain personal sponsorship deals with brands such as [[Parmalat]], [[Kaiser (beer)|Kaiser]], [[Arisco]] and [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] to fund Pedro's career.<ref>{{cite news| title =The Diniz Family buys into Prost| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns03225.html| date =[[2000-11-30]]| accessdate =2008-07-26}}</ref>  By {{F1|1993}}, through Diniz, Forti met [[Carlo Vallarino Gancia|Carlo Gancia]], an [[Italo-Brazilian]] businessman.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Gancia became a co-owner of the team, buying Guerci's shares, and started working on the team's Formula One project. He finally managed to ensure a respectable budget for Formula One by late {{F1|1994}}, which was "effectively underwritten by the Diniz family".<ref name="gpprofile"/> He also hired several experienced personnel, including designer [[Sergio Rinland]] and former [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] team manager [[Cesare Fiorio]].<ref name="gpprofile"/> Guerci remained with Forti as one of its race engineers.<ref>{{cite news| last=Saward| first=Joe| authorlink=Joe Saward| title =Seasonal Preview 1996| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00214.html |date =[[1996-02-01]]| accessdate =2008-07-03}}</ref>

===The Forti FG01 car===
{{main|Forti FG01}}
With this securing of financial assistance and recruitment of staff, Forti's participation in [[Formula One]] for {{F1|1995}} was assured.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Financed by various [[Brazil]]ian enterprises, such as Kaiser and [[Sadia]], and the Italian corporation Parmalat which were brought in by Ab<U+00ED>lio dos Santos Diniz,<ref name="Tremayne1">Tremayne, p.95.</ref> the team was guaranteed financial stability in the short term, with a first year budget of around <U+00A3>7.5 million.<ref name="f1rejects"/> In addition, this was only the first year of a planned three-year contract with Diniz and his backers.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95">''Formula 1 Review: Forti'' &ndash; Constanduros, Bob. Henry (ed.) (1995), p.71.</ref> However, the harder task for the team was designing and building its own car for the first time (as required by the F1 regulations). This turned out to be the main obstacle for Guido Forti, as he insisted on having a reliable car built instead of a fast one. That was precisely what he received: his first F1 chassis, the [[Forti FG01]], was an outdated, overweight and very slow machine, and has been described as nothing more than "a revised F3000 car"<ref name="GEF1">M<U+00E9>nard, Vol. 2, p.626.</ref> and, more harshly, "a fearful pile of junk".<ref name="gpreview">{{cite news| last=Saward| first=Joe| authorlink=Joe Saward| title =No news is big news!| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00420.html| date =[[1996-01-01]]| accessdate =2007-08-23}}</ref>

[[Image:Roberto Moreno Forti 1995 Britain (crop).jpg|thumb|left|[[Roberto Moreno]] driving the [[Forti FG01|FG01]] at the [[1995 British Grand Prix]]. He retired on lap 48 when the car's hydraulic pressure dropped.]]

{{quote box|quote="It simply wasn't efficient and we had to restart it. We took off more than 60&nbsp;kg from the first version to the last and by [[1995 British Grand Prix|Silverstone]] we were on the [[minimum]] weight limit. During the year we also had to re-homologate the nose and side pods, develop the semi-automatic gearbox, which was worth about half a second a lap, and redesign the monocoque, not in terms of shape but in terms of the lay-up of the skins."|source=&ndash;[[Giorgio Stirano]] on the problems experienced with the FG01.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/>|width=300px|align=right}}

The FG01 had many influences. Its roots dated back to {{F1|1991}} when former [[Brabham]] designer Rinland left the British team before the season ended. Rinland set up Astauto Ltd. in Tolworth, England, hiring several of his former collaborators from Brabham when the team closed its doors. Brabham sold the building and wind tunnel at Chessington to [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]], facilities that Astauto rented to develop the new [[Fondmetal]] GR02, which was designed and built by June 1992, just six months after it was commissioned by Gabriele Rumi. The Fondmetal GR02 was a natural successor of the Brabham BT60, in concept, as it was conceived by the same design team. Due to Fondmetal's own severe financial troubles, the GR02 was run only in a few races before the team was closed. When in late {{F1|1994}}, Forti bought the remains of the Fondmetal Team, acquiring all the spares of the GR02 in the process, the team then turned to Rinland to purchase the design of what would have been the {{F1|1993}} F1 car design by the Astauto Design Team after the collapse of the Fondmetal team. At that time, Rinland was living and working in California on a new [[ChampCar]] project. Forti sent his Chief Designer and former Astauto employee [[Chris Radage]] to California to gather all the technical information, data and drawings from Rinland, returning to Italy to design and develop the new Forti FG01. Rinland joined the team in early 1995 for a short period as Technical Director, once he had returned to Europe.<ref name="Rinland joins Forti">{{cite news| title =Rinland joins Forti| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00069.html| date =[[1995-03-27]]| accessdate =2006-01-13}}</ref> Rinland assisted experienced Italian engineers [[Giorgio Stirano]]<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> and [[Giacomo Caliri]] in designing the car.<ref>{{cite news| title =Forti - getting ready for action| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00011.html| date =[[1995-02-06]]| accessdate =2007-04-03}}</ref> The car's [[aerodynamics]] were completed by former Brabham employee [[Hans Fouche]] using [[Wind tunnel|wind-tunnels]] in [[South Africa]], and composite work was done by the [[Belco Avia]] company.<ref name="gpprofile"/> However, it was rumoured that the FG01 was little more than a re-working of the GR02.<ref name="f1rejects"/>

Thus the FG01 did not promise much in terms of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor aerodynamic performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-[[Cosworth]] ED [[V8 engine|V8]] customer engine largely financed by [[Ford do Brasil]]. It was also the only car to have a [[manual gearbox]] in the 1995 F1 season. The car was liveried in a blue-and-yellow colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green wheel-rims, illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Rinland subsequently left the team after a few weeks, after falling out with the team's management over the car's lack of competitiveness.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/><ref>{{cite news| title =Rinland leaves Forti?| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00124.html| date =[[1995-05-08]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref>

===The 1995 season=== 
Forti's number one driver for the {{F1|1995}} season was rookie Pedro Diniz who had raced for Forti in F3000, but without much success. However, he was guaranteed a seat as his family and sponsors were paying a significant amount of the team's budget.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> The second driver was later confirmed as his more experienced compatriot [[Roberto Moreno]], who had last competed in F1 back in {{F1|1992}} when he had a disastrous year driving for the infamous [[Andrea Moda Formula|Andrea Moda]] team. However, his seat was initially only guaranteed on a race-by-race basis,<ref name="Rinland joins Forti"/> as [[Portugal|Portuguese]] driver [[Pedro Lamy]] amongst others was also considered.<ref>{{cite news| title =Pedro Lamy for Forti?| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00092.html| date =[[1995-04-10]]| accessdate =2007-01-14}}</ref> The team had also had the option of signing several other experienced Brazilian drivers including [[Christian Fittipaldi]], [[Mauricio Gugelmin]] and [[Gil de Ferran]].<ref name="f1rejects"/> It was speculated that whoever joined the team would be contractually bound to be number two to Diniz,<ref>Tremayne, p.67.</ref> and that his father had insisted on an all-Brazilian driver line-up.<ref name="GEF1"/>

At the beginning of the season, the cars were embarrassingly slow, despite a healthy amount of testing.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening [[1995 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian GP]], but was seven laps down on winner [[Michael Schumacher]]. In [[1995 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]], this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner [[Damon Hill]] at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap ([[Domenico Schiattarella]] in the [[Simtek]]).<ref>''1995 Grands Prix - Argentine Grand Prix'' &ndash; Constanduros, Bob; Hamilton, Maurice and Henry, Alan. Henry (ed.) (1995), p.103.</ref> [[1995 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and brought up the tail of the field. Forti were already the butt of [[paddock]] jokes,<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: [[Pacific Racing|Pacific]], Simtek, and [[Minardi]]. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 minimum weight limit of 595&nbsp;kg<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/>), and a [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and [[monocoque]] were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.

[[Image:Pedro Diniz Forti 1995 Britain (crop).jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro Diniz]] driving the FG01 at the 1995 British GP. He retired on lap 13 with a broken gearbox.]]

Indeed, Forti's finishing record was good for rookies at 50% (excluding the non-classifications),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autocoursegpa.com/season_team~season~1995~teamsroot_id~7519.htm |title=Forti - 1995 Statistics |accessdate=2007-08-24 |publisher=autocoursegpa.com }}</ref> helping Diniz to establish a reputation as a steady, dependable driver.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> Forti were then elevated when Simtek folded after the [[1995 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco GP]], and Pacific's lack of finance and development enabled Forti to start matching them from the half-way point of the season.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> At the [[1995 German Grand Prix|German GP]], both Fortis outqualified both the Pacifics, and this happened on two further occasions during 1995. Forti's improvement was also aided by Pacific taking on two slow pay-drivers to ensure that the team finished the season, and regular driver [[Bertrand Gachot]] being race-rusty on his return for the last two races of the year.<ref name="f1rejects"/> At the final race of the season, in [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|Adelaide]], Forti seemed to have established a firm base for the {{F1|1996}} season, emphasised by Moreno qualifying within [[Formula One racing#107% Rule|107%]] of [[pole position]] for the first time - a crucial result, as this percentage of the pole time would be used to determine non-qualifiers in 1996 - and Diniz scoring the team's best result in F1, with a reliable run to seventh place, ahead of Gachot in the Pacific. This was only one position behind the points-scoring placings.<ref>See [[List of Formula One World Championship pointscoring systems]] for more information.</ref> Nevertheless, despite not scoring any points, Forti finished a ''de facto'' 11th in the [[1995 Formula One season|Constructors' Championship]], ahead of Pacific and Simtek by virtue of better finishes outside of the points.

Post-championship, Forti took part in the 1995 [[Bologna Motor Show]], where three FG01s &ndash; driven by [[Andrea Montermini]], [[Giovanni Lavaggi]] and [[Vittorio Zoboli]] &ndash; raced against, and lost to three Minardis in the [[1995 Formula One Indoor Trophy|Formula One Indoor Trophy]].<ref name="f1rejects"/>

Despite the progress made by Forti during the course of the season, 1995 was still regarded as a failure. The team had spent more money than its immediate rivals in designing, building and developing a fundamentally inefficient car.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Diniz and his sponsors were described as "throwing their money away",<ref name="gpreview"/> and the Brazilian's reputation as a serious F1 driver was damaged, as it took him several years to prove that he was not just in the sport because of his funding.<ref>Jones, p.91</ref> In addition, Moreno's participation with Forti was lamented by many observers, who felt that the experienced driver did not deserve the ignominy of such an uncompetitive car.<ref name="gpreview"/> The team's lack of pace was demonstrated by calculating all of the 1995 drivers' average qualifying time: both Diniz and Moreno were an average of over seven seconds off the fastest average qualifier, [[David Coulthard]].<ref name="f1rejects"/> The only positives were the decent reliability record &ndash; with the cars completing 59.1% of the total 1995 race distance<ref name="f1rejects"/> &ndash; and the fact that Forti would still be funded for two further years by the Diniz family.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/>

===The 1996 season===
With a solid base to build on and a healthy budget, {{F1|1996}} looked promising for Forti.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE95"/> The team negotiated for the most powerful and expensive [[Cosworth]] V8 engines in late 1995 to replace the outdated and underpowered ED models.<ref>{{cite news| title =Forti bids for new Ford V8| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00312.html| date =[[1995-10-02]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> However, these aspirations was dealt a devastating blow when Pedro Diniz signed for the more competitive [[Ligier]] team, taking [[Martin Brundle]]'s vacated seat as the latter moved to [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]. Forti's sponsors brought in by the Diniz family, including Parmalat and Marlboro, all left; the budget was significantly dented. For a time it seemed that the team would not compete in 1996 at all,<ref>{{cite news| title =...Forti to follow| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00385.html| date =[[1995-12-04]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> and its survival was constantly questioned.<ref name="Tremayne1"/> The new car was delayed, and the team was forced to use the uprated [[Forti FG01|FG01B]] car for the start of the season with the only slightly more competitive [[Cosworth|Ford Zetec-R]] [[V8 engine]] (instead of the "JS" it had been negotiating for),<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96">''Formula 1 Review: Forti'' &ndash; Henry, Alan. Henry (ed.) (1996), p.92.</ref> and to rely on temporary sponsors. Nevertheless, Forti remained in the sport for the 1996 season. [[Roberto Moreno]] was not retained after failing to beat Diniz the previous year, and the team signed Minardi and Pacific refugees [[Luca Badoer]]<ref>{{cite news| title =Forti signs Badoer| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00495.html| date =[[1996-02-26]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> and Montermini to drive (although [[Hideki Noda]] was also considered),<ref>{{cite news| title =Noda close to Forti| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00437.html| date =[[1996-01-15]]| accessdate =2006-11-24}}</ref> both drivers bringing a small amount of personal backing.  Frenchman [[Franck Lagorce]] was also signed as a test driver.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Pacific had folded during the off-season, and it was clear that Forti would be some way behind the rest of the field in the slow FG01B.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/> Badoer and Montermini failed to make the new 107% cut in qualifying for the [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] and thus did not start the race, but both then managed to qualify for the Grands Prix held in [[1996 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and [[1996 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]], scoring a 10th and an 11th place finish between them in the races. Badoer, however, attracted attention in Argentina for a different reason. As Diniz attempted to lap him, the two collided and Badoer's car flipped over; the Italian escaping injury. Both cars then failed to qualify at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|N<U+00FC>rburgring]].

Forti produced a new chassis, the [[Forti FG03|FG03]], for the next race of the season in [[1996 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]]. It had been designed by [[George Ryton]], who had become Forti's Technical Director after moving from [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] in April,<ref>{{cite news| title =Ryton to Forti| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00541.html| date =[[1996-04-01]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> and was also worked on by [[Chris Radage]] and [[Riccardo de Marco]].<ref name="f1rejects"/> Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity,<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/> but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind [[Ricardo Rosset]] in the [[Arrows|Footwork]]. Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind [[Pedro Lamy]]'s Minardi. Both drivers qualified in [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out [[Jacques Villeneuve]] as he was being lapped by the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]. He was fined [[United States dollar|$]]5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.<ref>''1996 Grands Prix - Monaco Grand Prix'' <U+2013> Constanduros, Bob; Hamilton, Maurice and Henry, Alan. Henry (ed.) (1996), p.147.</ref>

===Deal with Shannon Racing===

[[Image:Forti badoer montreal 1996.jpg|thumb|right|A new livery signalled a major sponsorship deal with Shannon, but did nothing to save the team from its collapse mid-season. This is [[Luca Badoer]] driving the [[Forti FG03|FG03]] at the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix]].]]

After the Monaco GP, there were rumours that Forti would not survive the season without some form of takeover.  In the period before the next race, the [[1996 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish GP]], [[Belco Avia]] boss [[Arron Colombo]] announced that a deal had been reached between Guido Forti and an entity known as [[Shannon Racing]], owned by parent company [[Finfirst]],<ref name="The end of the road for Forti?">{{cite news| title =The end of the road for Forti?| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00707.html| date =[[1996-07-29]]| accessdate =2007-01-14}}</ref> for the latter to buy a 51% share of the team.<ref name="gpprofile"/> Shannon Racing was believed to be an [[Ireland|Irish]]-registered section of a [[Milan|Milanese]] financial group, and had already established teams in various [[Formula Three]] championships and in [[Formula 3000]] in 1996. The group was keen to move into Formula One, and Forti provided an opportunity for this to happen. It was believed that Colombo had organised the deal because Belco Avia was owed money by Forti.<ref name="f1rejects"/>

For the Spanish GP, the cars therefore appeared in a new green-and-white livery, apparently confirming Shannon Racing's acquisition of 51% of Forti.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/>  This financial boost appeared to ensure the team's survival.<ref name="The end of the road for Forti?">{{cite news| title =The end of the road for Forti?| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00707.html| date =[[1996-07-29]]| accessdate =2007-01-14}}</ref> With all the off-track confusion, both drivers again failed to qualify. Nevertheless, at the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian]] and [[1996 French Grand Prix|French]] Grands Prix, both Fortis made it to the grid, Badoer even outqualifying Rosset in [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Montr<U+00E9>al]]. However, Forti had lost its good 1995 reliability record, as these starts only resulted in four retirements. By this time, Forti's financial problems, caused by a conflict between Guido Forti and Shannon Racing, were becoming increasingly urgent in nature. Both cars retired with "engine problems" at the French GP, although it was widely rumoured that this was due to the team running out of engine mileage as it went into debt with engine suppliers [[Cosworth]].<ref name="Forti - times are hard">{{cite news| title =Forti - times are hard| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00677.html| date =[[1996-07-08]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref>

===Bankruptcy and withdrawal from Formula One=== 
Guido Forti alleged that Shannon Racing had not paid him any money, and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team.<ref name="f1rejects"/> He duly took the company to court over the matter.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/><ref name="The end of the road for Forti?"/> As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the [[1996 British Grand Prix|British GP]].<ref name="Forti - times are hard"/> In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and was running out of engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/><ref>{{cite news| title =Shambles at Forti| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00689.html| date =[[1996-07-15]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> In the midst of the turmoil, Fiorio left the team and was replaced by [[Daniele Coronna]].<ref name="f1rejects"/> The team made it to the next race at [[1996 German Grand Prix|Hockenheim]], but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/> With the prospect of heavy [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-imposed fines for missed races looming if the situation did not improve,<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/> Forti withdrew his team from the sport. The team did not make an appearance at the [[1996 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian GP]],<ref>{{cite news| title =Forti disappears| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00746.html| date =[[1996-08-26]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> nor at any further point in the championship. [[Luca Badoer|Badoer]] and [[Andrea Montermini|Montermini]] were left without drives, and the promising FG03 chassis would no longer race. By the time Shannon Racing won the court case in September, Forti had ceased to exist.<ref>{{cite news| title =Forti chaos| publisher =grandprix.com| url =http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00754.html| date =[[1996-09-02]]| accessdate =2007-01-13}}</ref> Shannon Racing's teams in the lower motorsport categories also closed down.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Coincidentally, Guido Forti had signed the 1997 [[Concorde Agreement]] shortly before his team's demise, which could have given his team a chance of surviving if it had made it into {{F1|1997}} due to the extra television revenue that was granted to each of the teams from that year onwards.<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/>

==Legacy==
Forti's withdrawal marked not only the end of its participation in Formula One, but also terminated a team which had enjoyed success in [[Formula 3000]] and other minor categories. It is generally agreed that Forti may have succeeded if it had its 1995 budget and the FG03 car at the same time, and that Diniz's departure meant that it stood little chance of survival,<ref name="GEF1"/> but the team has become another example of a small, backmarking team unable to finance its aspirations;<ref name="AUTOCOURSE96"/> one of the final "privateer" teams to enter the sport in an era of increasing influence and participation from the large car manufacturers.<ref name="GEF1"/> Forti is often cited along with Pacific and Simtek as prime examples of this tendency.<ref name="f1rejects"/><ref name="GEF1"/> It was also argued that the increasing amount of money involved in financing an F1 team which was forcing many of the smaller teams to withdraw in the early to mid-1990s was a long-term threat to the future of the sport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/96/bri/waller3.html |title=The 107% Dilemma  |accessdate=2007-12-19 |publisher=atlasf1.autosport.com |last=Waller |first=Toby }}</ref> Alternatively, some saw Forti and similar tail-enders as undeserving of a place in F1, and it has been suggested that the imposition of the 107% rule by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] in 1996 was a move to force them to raise their game or leave the sport altogether.<ref>''Storm Clouds Gather? The State of Formula One'' &ndash; Henry, Alan. Henry (ed.) (1995), p.38.</ref>

However, the Forti F1 cars have since been used for other purposes. At the 2000 [[Autosport International]], two Forti chassis were used as part of an "F1 Driving Experience" programme organised by the [[Aintree Racecourse|Aintree]] Racing Drivers' School.<ref name="f1rejects"/> Examples of the FG03 are also currently being used as part of F1-themed [[track day]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] at motor racing circuits such as [[Rockingham Motor Speedway|Rockingham]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.intotheblue.co.uk/site/pages/ui_category3.aspx?Cat3ID=17|title= Formula 1|publisher =intotheblue.co.uk|accessdate= 2007-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockingham.co.uk/drivingdays/ultimate.asp |title=The Ultimate Driving Day |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=rockingham.co.uk }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racing-school.co.uk/driving/formula1.asp |title=Formula 1 Driving Experience |accessdate=2007-09-27 |publisher=racing-school.co.uk }}</ref>

Forti appears in the [[PlayStation]] [[video game]] ''[[Formula 1 (PS1)|Formula 1]]'', the first in a [[Formula One (video game series)|long-running series]] of [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] games based on the sport. The team is also featured in the [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[F1 Pole Position 64]]'', featuring the white and green Shannon livery. The games were based on the [[1995 Formula One season|1995]] and [[1996 Formula One season|1996]] seasons respectively.
