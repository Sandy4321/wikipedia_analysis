==Transitions==
===Bendayan to Correa (1988)===
[[File:Sabado Sensacional.jpg|thumb|left|The original ''S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional'' logo.]]
The heavy schedule of a long running variety television show took its toll on [[Amador Bendayan]]'s health at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s. His abuse of cigarettes and his struggle with [[diabetes mellitus]] made it sometimes impossible to please his audience, forcing him to rest down, with his absence being covered by other hosts, including model and actress Miriam Ochoa, C<U+00E9>sar Gonz<U+00E1>lez (''"el amigo de todos" - "Everybody's friend"''), journalist and broadcaster Napole<U+00F3>n Bravo and  Gilberto Correa, who at the time was the host of another successful Venevision show ''"De Fiesta Con Venevisi<U+00F3>n"'' (and would eventually take over as permanent host until 1996). Meanwhile, people were patient enough to wait for Bendayan's constant returns, welcoming him with the now memorable slogan of ''"<U+00C1>nimo Amador"'' (Cheer up, Amador) which later became a stample of the show during the entire decade.

Bendayan's wish for a better respect to artists around the country was fulfilled in 1985, when he hosted an event celebrating his idea of '''La Casa del Artista''' (The Artist's House, which was inaugurated officially in late 1988). But despite his efforts, Amador's health was rapidly deteriorating by this time and was forced to retire completely from the show, while the audience still watched his show and the many musical performers would sign a flipchart pleading for his return.

In late July 1989, agonizing in his deathbed, Bendayan made producer Ricardo Pe<U+00F1>a write a letter as a farewell message to Venezuela and his wish to continue producing the show with Gilberto Correa, who was in charge of reading Bendayan's last will on a special aired the day after he died, on August 4, 1989.

Amador Bendayan's death was a hard blow on everyone who worked or participated on the show, particularly on Ricardo Pe<U+00F1>a (who would later pass away in 2009). Despite the grief, the show kept on with new host Gilberto Correa, generating higher ratings and focusing even more on multitudinary events, like state fairs, the "Super Bingo de la Bondad", and the "Festival de la Orquidea" (an event founded by Amador Bendayan in 1982, to celebrate the Maracaibo Chiquinquira Fair).

===Correa to Sarcos (1996)===

[[Daniel Sarcos]]'s youthful energy caught the eye of Gilberto Correa, who at the time saw his own inevitable retire that same year. Sarcos started by covering the "Mega Match Sensacional" segment (which took place next door to the main studio) for his first appearance on the show, while Correa was hosting in the main studio. One of the most well known segments on the show was ''La Guerra De Los Sexos''. Introduced in 2001, this segment is where a team of three male celebrities compete against a team of three female celebrities in various games. ''La Guerra De Los Sexos'' later became its own show in early 2009. The talent show segment, "El Precipicio" was added in 2006, featuring a jury of three people dressed like [[Juan Gabriel]], El Chacal (from ''[[Sabado Gigante]]''), [[Alejandro Corona]], [[Do<U+00F1>a Gurmesinda]], [[Don Francisco]], etc. They have many other new segments covered many slots of the show's duration, generating criticism amongst its viewers, ''S<U+00FA>per S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional'' still goes strong over 40 years on air, maintaining its place as one of the longest running variety shows in Latin America.

In 2009, a tribute was made to Amador Bendayan for the 20th anniversary of his death. Former host Gilberto Correa, as well as many other previous guests of ''S<U+00FA>per S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional'' all returned to participate in the tribute. The original ''S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional'' theme song was used for the intro of this episode.

===Sarcos to Villalobos (2010)===
Sarcos later signed a contract with a network in Ecuador. [[Venevision]] got deeper into details with the situation, and by January 2010, Sarcos finally admitted that he has signed a contract with [[Ecuavisa]], and was willing to still continue with Venevision, but production executives did not allow it. His contract with Venevision expired, and Sarcos left ''S<U+00FA>per S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional''.

On February 13, 2010, entertainer [[Leonardo Villalobos]] debuted as host of ''S<U+00FA>per S<U+00E1>bado Sensacional'', following his departure from his previous show, [[Portada's]].
