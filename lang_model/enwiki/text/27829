Bomis began a search for experts to vet articles on Nupedia; these steps proved tedious in nature.<ref name="brennenjensen" /> In August 2000, Nupedia included over 60 academics contributing to the peer review process on the site; a majority of them held doctor of philosophy or [[doctor of medicine]] degrees.<ref name="nupedialaunchesopen">{{cite journal|title=Nupedia Launches Open-Content Model|journal=School Library Journal|volume=46|issue=8|date=August 2000|page=S6|publisher=Library Journals, LLC.

Nupedia was encumbered due to its laborious peer review system.<ref name="patrickseitz" /><ref name="edemariam" /> The peer review method on Nupedia consisted of a seven-step-process.<ref name="kensmyers" /><ref name="johnplewis" /> Articles were required to go through multiple stages of both review and copy editing.<ref name="heatherhasan" /> Wikipedia grew at a faster rate than Nupedia.<ref name="ayers" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Wikipedia's knowledge quest|first=Helen|last=Twose|date=November 10, 2007|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|location=Auckland, New Zealand|page=5|publisher= APN Newspapers Pty Ltd.}}</ref> In November 2000, Nupedia had 115 potential articles awaiting entrance into its peer review process.<ref name="frauenfelder" /><ref name="johnplewis" /> By September 2001, after a total investment of US$250,000 from Bomis, Nupedia had produced 12 articles.<ref name="cynthiabarnett" /><ref name="koerner">{{cite book|pages=115<U+2013>117|title=The Best of Technology Writing 2006|first=Brendan I. |last=Koerner|year=2006|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-03195-5}}</ref><ref name="johnplewis" /> From the period of 2000 through 2003, Nupedia contributors produced a total of 24 finalized articles.<ref name="elisecraig" /><ref name="ayers" /><ref name="kensmyers" /> Wikipedia had about 20,000 articles and functioned in 18 languages by the tail end of 2001.<ref name="jennykleeman" />

From January 15, 2001 through March 1, 2002, Sanger was the sole paid editor of Wikipedia.<ref name="spotlightsanger" /> He stepped down from his dual roles as Chief Organizer of Wikipedia and Editor-in-Chief of Nupedia on March 1, 2002, because he felt he would be unable to significantly commit to these arenas as a volunteer in a non-full-time capacity.<ref name="spotlightsanger" /> Sanger felt there was a dearth of "the habit or tradition of respect for expertise" from the high-ranking members of Wikipedia.<ref name="mahadevan" /> He continued to contribute to community discussions and felt optimistic about the potential for the future success of Wikipedia.<ref name="jaredduval">{{cite book|pages=74<U+2013>75, 80<U+2013>81|title=Next Generation Democracy: What the Open-Source Revolution Means for Power, Politics, and Change|first=Jared|last= Duval|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60819-066-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Encyclopedias go digital Educational tomes shrink in size, but grow in number |date=May 6, 2002 |first=Kim|last=Peterson|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|page=C-1|publisher=Union-Tribune Publishing Co.}}</ref>

===Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees===
[[File:WM2006 0044.jpg|thumb|In 2004 community elections added two Wikipedia contributors to the Board; the three founders of Bomis retained their seats.<ref name="andrewlih" />]]
Since Wikipedia became a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and Sanger decided to fund the project through charity.<ref name="neate"/> Bomis was placed into a position where it needed to lay off the majority of its employees in order to continue operating, as Wikipedia was not producing revenues for the company.<ref name="susanmeyer" /> Bomis effectively owned the assets of Wikipedia from its creation through 2003.<ref name="rosenzweig" /><ref name="canhistorybeopen" /> Wales utilized approximately US$100,000 of revenues from Bomis to assist Wikipedia prior to the decision to shift the encyclopedia to a non-profit status.<ref name="martinhickman">{{cite news|first=Martin|last=Hickman|coauthors=GeneviAve Roberts|title=Wikipedia under the microscope over accuracy|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London, England|date=February 13, 2006|page=12|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/wikipedia-under-the-microscope-over-accuracy-466444.html|accessdate=January 18, 2014}}</ref>

In June 2003, the property of Wikipedia was formally given over to the nascent non-profit organization, the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].<ref name="rosenzweig" /><ref name="canhistorybeopen" /> The Wikimedia Foundation was formed to serve as a charitable institution with a mission of supervising Wikipedia and multiple other associated wiki-based sites.<ref name="kangwanchern" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Feature|work=Computer Weekly|volume=203|date=January 13, 2009|publisher=TechTarget}}</ref> Once the Wikimedia Foundation was set up, its staff began to solicit sources of public funding.<ref name="kangwanchern" /> Bomis turned over its associated ownership rights regarding Wikipedia to the new non-profit.<ref name="jaredduval" /> All hardware owned by Bomis used to run Wikipedia associated web sites was given to the Wikimedia Foundation.<ref name="ayers" /> Wales swapped the copyright ownerships related to Wikipedia from Bomis to the Wikimedia Foundation.<ref name="ayers" /> The Wikimedia Foundation was first headquartered in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]],<ref name="ayers">{{cite book|pages=46<U+2013>47, 448<U+2013>451|title=[[How Wikipedia Works|How Wikipedia Works: And How You Can Be a Part of It]]|first=Phoebe|last=Ayers|coauthors=Charles Matthews, Ben Yates|publisher=No Starch Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59327-176-3}}</ref> where Bomis was located.<ref name="mehegan" />
