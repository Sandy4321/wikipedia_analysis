Oxford were pre-race favourites, but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station.<ref name=rage>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/rowing/2295825/Boat-Race-Row-rage-wins-day-for-Oxford.html| title = Boat Race row rage wins day for Oxford | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | first = Rachel | last = Quarrell | date = 30 March 2008 | accessdate = 27 June 2014}}</ref>  Oxford took an early lead,<ref name=sink>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583194/Oxford-sink-Cambridge-in-University-Boat-Race.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | title = Oxford sink Cambridge in University Boat Race | date = 29 March 2008 | accessdate = 26 June 2014 }}</ref> but the boats closed on each other, and Umpire John Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both coxes in an attempt to prevent a collision.  By [[Craven Cottage]], Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded; by the time the crews passed under [[Hammersmith Bridge]] they were level.  Along [[Chiswick Eyot]] Oxford moved ahead once again, and were clear of Cambridge after 30 strokes.  Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in 20 minutes 53 seconds, six lengths and 22 seconds ahead of their opponents.<ref name=rage/>  Driving rain, strong winds and choppy water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years,<ref name=sink/> but the largest margin of victory since the [[The Boat Race 2004|2004 race]].<ref name=results/>
