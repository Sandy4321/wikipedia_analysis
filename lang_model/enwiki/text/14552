RM&nbsp;2023 was originally designated in 1952 as a Farm to Market Road in Nacogdoches County. FM&nbsp;2023 began at [[U.S. Route 59 in Texas|U.S. Highway&nbsp;59]] (US&nbsp;59) in [[Garrison, Texas|Garrison]] and proceeded {{convert|4.0|mi|km|1}} to the southeast. In 1958, that route designation was cancelled when the road was added to {{roadlink|state=TX|FM|138}} as an extension.<ref name="RM 2023"/>

The current route in Pecos County was designated along its present extent in 1959. The road previously terminated at {{roadlink|state=TX|US|290}}, the predecessor route to I-10 through much of western Texas.<ref name="RM 2023"/>
