'''''Blue's Clues''''' is an American [[children's television show]] that premiered on September 8, 1996, on the cable television network [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]],<ref name="tenyears-1"/> and ran for a decade, until August 6, 2006.  Producers [[Angela Santomero]], [[Todd Kessler]], and [[Traci Paige Johnson]] combined concepts from [[child development]] and early-childhood education with innovative animation and production techniques that helped their viewers learn. It was hosted originally by [[Steve Burns]], who although a crucial factor in its success, left in 2002 to pursue a music career, and was replaced by [[Donovan Patton]]. The show follows an animated blue-spotted dog named Blue as she plays a game with the host and the viewers.  ''Blue's Clues'' became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was critical to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called "one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking [[preschool]] television series of all time".<ref name="tenyears-1"/>  A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] called ''[[Blue's Room]]'' premiered in 2004.

The show's producers and creators presented material in a [[narrative]] format instead of the more traditional [[magazine]] format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in the U.S., and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement.  Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show, and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers, and resembled a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple [[construction paper]] shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures.  Its home-based setting was familiar to American children, but had a look unlike other children's TV shows.  A live production of ''Blue's Clues'', which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.

By 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for excellence in children's programming, educational software, and licensing, and had been nominated for nine [[Emmy Awards]].  Versions of the show have been produced in other countries, and it has been syndicated in 120 countries and translated into 15 languages. It was one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content. The show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several research studies that have provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool.

==History==
[[File:BluePeriwinkle.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Toy versions of the characters Blue and Periwinkle]]

''Blue's Clues'' was developed during a transitional period for children's television.  In 1990, [[United States Congress|Congress]] had passed the [[Children's Television Act]], which required networks and TV stations to devote a portion of their programming to children's shows, but the legislation did not specify how many hours of programming broadcasters were required to air. It set no guidelines or criteria for educational programs and had no provisions for enforcement.  According to author Diane Tracy in her 2002 book ''Blue's Clues for Success'', "The state of children's television was pretty dismal".<ref name="tracy-5" />{{#tag:ref|Tracy's book is a business guide based on Nickelodeon and the history of ''Blue's Clues''. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''{{'}}s noted the value in Tracy's discussion of the creators' and producers' business model, but found Tracy's tone "less then optimal for discerning executive readers".<ref name="pweekly"/>|group=note}} Since the late 1960s, [[PBS]] was one of the few sources for children's educational television programming in the U.S., and most other US educational TV shows were violent and were created for the purpose of selling toys.<ref name="tracy57"/> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ruled in 1997 that the commercial networks had to air educational children's programs for a minimum of three hours per week. The cable network [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], which had been airing programs for 6- to 12-year-olds, was not legally bound by this legislation, but complied with it anyway, many years before the laws and regulations were passed.<ref name="tracy57"/>

Nickelodeon assigned a team of producers to create a new U.S. television program for young children in mid-1994, using research on [[early childhood education]] and the viewing habits of preschoolers. These producers, who were made up of the "green creative team"<ref name="tenyears-1"/> of [[Angela Santomero]], [[Todd Kessler]], and [[Traci Paige Johnson]], met at [[Nickelodeon Studios]] for a month to develop ''Blue's Clues''. Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson, according to Tracy, did not have the traditional backgrounds of most producers of children's programs, but "did possess an amazing combination of talents, backgrounds and personal attributes".<ref name="tracy-12"/>{{#tag:ref|Santomero worked at Nickelodeon as a researcher, Kessler was a freelance producer, and Johnson was a freelance artist and animator.<ref name="tracy-1314"/>  Kessler left Nickelodeon in 2000, but was listed as an executive producer throughout the show's run.<ref name="carter"/>|group=note}}  Researcher [[Daniel R. Anderson]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], who had also worked on ''Sesame Street'', was an adviser for the new show.<ref name="anderson2-34"/>  The character Blue was originally conceived as a cat, and the name of the show was to be "Blue's Prints", but the show's name was changed and Blue became a dog because Nickelodeon was already producing a show about a cat.<ref name="tenyears-1"/> Kessler handled the show's production, Santomero the research, and Johnson the animation and design.<ref name="repetition"/> They were given a modest $150,000 to produce a pilot.<ref name="tracy-14"/>

''Blue's Clues'' premiered in the U.S. on September 8, 1996.<ref name="tenyears-2"/> It was a smash hit, largely due to the producers'<U+00A0>extensive research,<ref name="interactive"/> and became crucial to Nickelodeon's growth.<ref name="schmelzer"/> Within 18 months of its premiere, ''Blue's Clues'' was as well known as more established children's shows such as the 30-year-old ''Sesame Street''.<ref name="tracy-3"/> It became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on commercial television.<ref name="tubefortots"/> By 2002, 13.7 million viewers tuned in each week.<ref name="tracy-3"/>

In January 2006, a spin-off, ''[[Blue's Room]]'', was launched. It starred ''Blue's Clues'' second host, [[Donovan Patton]], and featured puppets instead of animation. ''Blue's Clues'' celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2006 with a DVD that consisted of a 12-minute retrospective produced by [[VH1]]'s "[[Behind the Music]]" staff, and a collection of "milestone"<ref name="skein"/> episodes, including first host [[Steve Burns]]' 2002 departure.<ref name="schmelzer"/>

===Casting===
The most important casting decision was that of the host, the only human character in the show. The host's role was to empower and challenge the show's young viewers, to help increase their self-esteem, and to strongly connect with them through the television screen. The producers originally wanted a female host,<ref name="tracy-45"/> but after months of research and over 1,000 auditions, they hired actor/performer Steve Burns based on the strength of his audition.<ref name="tenyears-1"/><ref name="tracy-45"/> Burns received the strongest and most enthusiastic response in tests with preschoolers.<ref name="tracy-46"/> Johnson said that what made Burns a great children's TV host was that "he didn't want to be a children's host&nbsp;... He loved kids, but he didn't want to make a career out of it".<ref name="meandyou"/> Burns remained on ''Blue's Clues'' for seven years and was in over 100 episodes before he left to pursue a musical career in 2002.<ref name="tenyears-2"/> Burns himself stated, "I knew I wasn't gonna be doing children's television all my life, mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid's TV show, and it was happenin'<U+2014>fast."<ref name="tenyears-2"/>

Accompanied by a "concentrated multiplatform promotional campaign"<ref name="nondog"/> that included articles in Nickelodeon's magazine and on its webpage, an arc of three episodes introduced Burns' replacement Donovan Patton, who played Steve's brother Joe.<ref name="tracy-47"/> Patton was subjected to the same kind of scrutiny to earn the job,<ref name="tenyears-2"/> and was selected out of 1,500 auditions.{{#tag:ref|Burns was involved in Patton's selection.<ref name="tracy-48"/>|group=note}}<ref name="newhost"/> Patton had never seen ''Blue's Clues'' before he auditioned for the part, but like Burns, was the favorite with preschool test audiences.<ref name="tracy-47"/> Burns helped train Patton to perform the role. "We saw Steve Burns' retirement from the show as a chance to put ''Blue's Clues'' on a new course", Johnson said.<ref name="newhost"/> Also according to Johnson, Joe's character was more like a preschooler and more innocent than Steve.<ref name="newhost"/>

Johnson was cast as Blue's voice because, of the show's crew, she was able to sound the most like a dog. [[Nick Balaban]], who wrote the music for the show along with Michael Rubin, was cast as the voice of Mr. Salt. Balaban initially used a [[Brooklyn]] accent for Mr. Salt before settling on a French accent.<ref name="tenyears-1" />  Rubin performed the voice of Mailbox.<ref name="tracy-52" />

==Format==
In ''[[The Tipping Point]]'', author [[Malcolm Gladwell]] called the show "sticky", and described its format:
<blockquote>
Steve, the host, presents the audience with a puzzle involving Blue, the animated dog&nbsp;... To help the audience unlock the puzzle, Blue leaves behind a series of clues, which are objects marked with one of her paw prints.  In between the discovery of the clues, Steve plays a series of [[games]]<U+2014>mini-puzzles<U+2014>with the audience that are thematically related to the overall puzzle&nbsp;... As the show unfolds, Steve and Blue move from one animated set to another, jumping through magical doorways, leading viewers on a journey of discovery, until, at the end of the story, Steve returns to the living room. There, at the climax of the show, he sits down in a comfortable chair to think<U+2014>a chair known, of course, in the literal world of ''Blue's Clues'', as the Thinking Chair. He puzzles over Blue's three clues and attempts to come up with the answer.<ref name="gladwell-122"/>
</blockquote>

Nickelodeon researcher Daniel R. Anderson called the structure of ''Blue's Clues'' a game that presented its viewers with increasingly challenging and developmentally appropriate problems to solve.<ref name="anderson-181"/>  Early episodes focused on basic subjects such as colors and numbers, but later the programs focused on [[Mathematics|math]], [[physics]], [[anatomy]], and [[astronomy]].<ref name="schmelzer"/> The show's producers believed that comprehension and attention were strongly connected, so they wrote the episodes to encourage and increase their viewers' attention.  They used content and production characteristics such as pacing which gave children time to respond,<ref name="watchlearn"/> as well as "camera techniques, children's voices, musical cues, sound effects, clear transitions, repeatable dialogue, and visuals".<ref name="anderson-181"/>  Participation, in the form of spoken or physical response from the audience, and the mastery of thinking skills were encouraged by the use of repetition, both within the structure of individual episodes and across multiple episodes.<ref name="watchlearn"/>  The producers used a variety of formal features, which were auditory, and content features, which consisted of invitations given to the audience, such as "Will you help?"  The features were also in the form of both recurrent and unique formats and content.  The purpose of the recurrent formats and content, which were similar in every episode, was to increase viewers' attention, comprehension, and participation during key educational lessons.<ref name="crawley-267"/>

Nickelodeon originally aired the same episode daily for five days before showing the next one.  The producers believed this telecast strategy empowered young children by giving them many opportunities to master the content and problems presented to them.<ref name="repetition"/><ref name="crawley-265"/>

==Educational goals==
The creators' and producers' goals were to "empower, challenge, and build the self-esteem of preschoolers"<ref name="anderson-180"/> while entertaining them.  Kessler, Santomero, and Johnson were influenced by ''[[Sesame Street]]'', the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research.<ref name="truglio-234"/>  "We wanted to learn from ''Sesame Street'' and take it one step further," Santomero said.<ref name="gladwell-111"/>  Like ''Sesame Street'', [[Formative assessment|formative research]], which the producers called their "secret sauce",<ref name="tracy-67"/> was used during all aspects of the creative and decision-making process during the production of ''Blue's Clues''.<ref name="tracy-66"/><ref name="tracy-70"/>  In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' its "call and response style",<ref name="schmelzer"/> that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and [[Prosocial behavior|prosocial]] messages.<ref name="anderson-180"/>  In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play.  By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra.<ref name="bugs-3"/>{{#tag:ref|Alice Wilder joined the team shortly after its debut and, according to Tracy, reinvented the role of research in children's television, as well as helping to train the writers and animators to trust and use research.<ref name="tracy-68"/>|group=note}} The research team and creators worked collaboratively.<ref name="tracy-72"/>

Unlike ''Sesame Street'', which tested a third of its episodes,<ref name="gladwell-127"/> the ''Blue's Clues'' research team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two to six in preschool environments such as [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs, public schools, and private day care centers.  There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis.<ref name="anderson-182"/>  In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven,<ref name="tracy-21"/> the show was "immediately successful."<ref name="tenyears-1"/>  They found that as the pilot progressed, children's attention was not only captured and sustained, but they became excited and actively participated with what they saw, to the point that they stood up to get closer to the television and spoke back to the host.<ref name="tracy-2223"/>  The producers and researchers also consulted outside advisers, who were chosen based on their expertise and the needs of each script.  As Anderson stated, the formative research team served "as a liaison between the feedback provided by the preschoolers and outside advisers and the production team, including writers, talent, producers, directors, element artists, and animators".<ref name="anderson-182"/>

Twenty years worth of research had showed that television, a "cultural artifact" accessible to most American children, could be a "powerful educational agent".<ref name="bugs-3"/>  The show was designed and produced on the assumption that, since children are cognitively active when they watch television,<ref name="anderson2-34"/> a show could be an effective method of scientific education for young children by telling stories through pictures and by modeling behavior and learning.<ref name="tracy-40"/>  The creators and producers used film techniques to present information from multiple perspectives in many "real world" contexts, or situations within the daily experiences of young children.  They wanted to provide their viewers with more "authentic learning opportunities"<ref name="bugs-3"/> by placing problem-solving tasks within the stories they told, by slowly increasing the difficulty of these tasks, and by inviting their involvement.<ref name="bugs-3"/><ref name="anderson2-35"/>  These learning opportunities included the use of [[mnemonics]] in the form of mantras and songs, and what Tracy called "metacognitive wrap-up"<ref name="tracy-40"/> at the end of each episode, in which the lessons were summarized and rehearsed.  The producers wanted to foster their audience's sense of empowerment by eliciting their assistance for the show's host and by encouraging their identification with the character Blue, who served as a stand-in for the typical preschooler.<ref name="tracy-2122"/>

''Sesame Street'' was designed around the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans, so its curriculum was a magazine-like format<ref name="watchlearn"/> in which each episode was made up of a variety of segments.<ref name="truglio-234"/>  Based on research conducted over the 30 years since the launch of ''Sesame Street'' by theorists like Anderson, the producers of ''Blue's Clues'' wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but ''Blue's Clues'' was one of the first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement.  Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected<U+2014>for up to a half hour<U+2014>and learn more.  They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional [[narrative]] format.  As ''Variety Magazine'' stated, "...&nbsp;The choice for ''Blue's Clues'' became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page."<ref name="interactive"/>  Every episode of ''Blue's Clues'' was structured in this way.<ref name="interactive"/>

The pace of ''Blue's Clues'' was deliberate, and its material was presented clearly.<ref name="tubefortots"/>  Similar to Mr. Roger's Neighborhood, which also inspired the producers,<ref name="tracy-18"/> one way this was done was in the use of pauses that were "long enough to give the youngest time to think, short enough for the oldest not to get bored."<ref name="interactive"/>  The length of the pauses, which was estimated from formative research, gave children enough time to process the information and solve the problem.  After pausing, child voiceovers provided the answers so that they were given to children who had not come up with the solution, and helped encourage viewer participation.  Researcher Alisha M. Crawley and her colleagues stated that the show was "unique in making overt involvement a systematic research-based design element".<ref name="crawley-265"/>  In 2002, the success of ''Blue's Clues'' inspired the producers of ''Sesame Street'' to change its format and add more interactive segments.<ref name="schmelzer"/> ''Blue's Clues'' also differed from ''Sesame Street'' by not using cultural references or humor aimed at adults, as this could confuse preschoolers, but instead made the show literal, which the producers felt would better hold the children's attention.<ref name="tracy-19"/>  The structure of each episode was repetitive, designed to provide preschoolers with comfort and predictability.<ref name="tracy-40"/>

==Production==
''Blue's Clues'' was set in the home<U+2014>the environment that was most familiar and secure for preschoolers<U+2014>and looked like no other children's television show.<ref name="tracy-18"/>  Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year.  Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed and approved by the show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story in the form of a storybook and take notes about the children's responses.  The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback.  A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.<ref name="tracy-8284"/>

Most of the show's production was done in-house, rather than by outside companies as was customary for children's TV shows.<ref name="tracy-103"/>  The show's creators understood that the look and visual design of the show would be integral to children's attachment with it.<ref name="tracy-95"/>  Johnson expanded on the "cut-out" style she had created during her college years. ''Blue's Clues'' was the first animated series for preschoolers that utilized simple cut-out construction paper shapes of familiar objects with a wide variety of colors and textures, resembling a storybook.<ref name="tracy-41"/> Johnson also used primary colors and organized each room of the home setting into groups.  The green-striped shirt worn by the show's original host, Steve, was inspired by [[Fruit Stripe gum]].<ref name="tracy-42"/>  The goals were to make the show look natural and simplistic; as Tracy put it, "freshly cut and glued together with a vivid array of textures, colors, and shadows"<ref name="tracy-4243"/> similar to picture book illustrations. The music, produced by composer Michael Rubin and pianist Nick Balaban, was simple had a natural sound, and exposed children to a wide variety of genres and instruments.  According to Tracy, the music empowered children and gave the show "a sense of playfulness, a sense of joy, and a sense of the fantastic".<ref name="tracy-51"/>  Rubin and Balaban encouraged the musicians who performed for the show to improvise.<ref name="tracy-5052"/>

The host performed each episode in front of a "[[Chroma key|blue screen]]", with animation added later.<ref name="tracy-45"/> The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background.<ref name="tracy-103"/> This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth.<ref name="tracy-43"/>  Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a [[Macintosh]] computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as [[Media 100]], [[Ultimatte]], [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]], and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]],<ref name="tracy-100"/>{{#tag:ref|[[Adobe Systems]] was surprised that their products were being used in the production of a children's television show.  According to Tracy, "Not even the developers of the software knew it could be used to create character animation on the scale ''Blue's Clues'' was using it".<ref name="tracy-106"/>  Adobe later requested that the show's animators join their client development group, and made several changes and improvements to their software as a result.|group=note}} instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation. The result was something that looked different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods.<ref name="tracy-94"/>  Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences.<ref name="tracy-101"/>  Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story.<ref name="tracy-105"/>  By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a "state-of-the-art"<ref name="tracy-109"/> $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.<ref name="tracy-107"/>

==Reception==
Ratings for ''Blue's Clues'&nbsp;'' were high during its first season, and it was Nickelodeon's most popular preschool program.<ref name="anderson2-35"/>  It has been described as the first commercial television show for preschoolers that was both educational and profitable.<ref name="tracy-35"/>  Its creators met regularly with businesses that developed ''Blue's Clues'' merchandise and products, to ensure that toys that were educational and met "the same high&nbsp;... standards as the show".<ref name="tracy-35"/>  Products, like the show, were heavily tested prior to marketing.<ref name="tracy-156"/>{{#tag:ref|In order to keep the integrity of the ''Blue's Clues'' brand intact, a branding guide "bible" called ''Blues Clues 101'' was created that explained the show and provided examples of products that both correctly and incorrectly reflected it.<ref name="tracy-155"/>|group=note}}  ''Blue's Clues'' had sold almost 40 million units of its 45 VHS and DVD titles by 1998,<ref name="skein"/> and generated over $1 billion in product licensing in 2000.<ref name="tracy-3"/>  More than ten million ''Blue's Clues'' books were in print by 2001, and over three million copies of six CD-ROM titles based on the show had been sold.<ref name="tracy-4"/>  Seven ''Blue's Clues'' titles sold at least 1 million copies each.<ref name="skein"/>  The show's first [[direct to video]] production was ''[[Blue's Big Musical Movie]]'' (2000), featuring [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Persuasions]]; it received mostly positive reviews<ref name="goodall"/> and has sold over 3 million copies since 2006.<ref name="skein"/>  The launch of ''Blue's Clues'' products at [[FAO Schwarz]]'s flagship store in New York City was the most successful product launch in the store's history, and was attended by over 7,000 people.<ref name="tracy-5"/>  By 2002, ''Blue's Clues'' had received several awards for children's programming, educational software, and licensing<ref name="tracy-4"/> and been nominated for nine [[Emmy Award]]s.<ref name="tracy-xi"/>

Starting in 1999, a live production of ''Blue's Clues'' toured the U.S. to positive reviews.<ref name="tracy-53"/>  Johnson compared the show's audience participation with that of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.<ref name="skiddoos"/>  As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.<ref name="tracy-53"/> The creators of the TV show were involved in all aspects of the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage,<ref name="tracy-55"/> and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience.<ref name="skiddoos"/> The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer,<ref name="tracy-53"/> Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater.<ref name="tracy-54"/> Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for the TV show, composed the live show's soundtrack.<ref name="tracy-55"/> The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of the TV show), but his young audience enthusiastically accepted embraced him.<ref name="tracy-56"/> Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run.  The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.<ref name="tracy-5657"/>

Regional versions of the show, featuring native hosts, have been produced in other countries. It was successful in the UK (hosted by [[Kevin Duala]]), became part of [[pop culture]] in Korea,<ref name="tracy-5960"/> was syndicated in 120 countries, and was translated into 15 languages.<ref name="schmelzer"/>  In 2000, it became one of the first preschool shows to incorporate [[American Sign Language]] into its content, with between five and ten signs used consistently in each episode.<ref name="lee"/>  ''Blue's Clues'' won an award from the Greater Los Angeles Agency on Deafness (GLAD) for promoting deaf awareness in the media.<ref name="tracy-58"/>

==Influence==
The show's extensive use of research in its development and production process inspired several studies that provided evidence for its effectiveness as a learning tool.  Field tests showed that the attention and comprehension of young viewers increased with each repeat viewing.<ref name="gladwell-125126"/>  In 1999, Anderson and a team of researchers, some of which were his colleagues at Nickelodeon, studied how episode repetition affected comprehension, audience participation, and visual attention. The researchers tested whether repeated viewings of the show resulted in mastery over the material presented, or whether viewers would habituate or become bored.<ref name="anderson-183"/>  They discovered that audience participation was lower for the first few viewings, because children paid more attention to unfamiliar material, and because it was more cognitively demanding to understand and solve the problems presented.  After five viewings, more of the viewers' cognitive resources were available for interaction and participation, so they answered more questions.  Episode repetition seemed to empower viewers, as shown in their enthusiastic efforts to solve the problems presented to them.<ref name="anderson-184"/>  Repetition, which the researchers called "an inexpensive tool to maximize comprehension",<ref name="anderson-192"/> improved comprehension, held children's attention, and increased audience participation.<ref name="media-51"/>  Children were not only tolerant of repetition, they were "positively enthusiastic"<ref name="anderson-192"/> about it.  [[Nielsen ratings]] of the show's first season, when the same episode was shown daily, were flat over the five-day period, which indicated to Anderson that young children did not tire of its repetition or of its complexity over time.<ref name="anderson2-35"/>  Anderson and Crawley felt that the telecast strategy helped increase the show's ratings, and called it a success.<ref name="effect-636"/>

In 2000, another team of researchers, including Anderson, Crawley, and other Nickelodeon colleagues, studied if experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with the show than less-frequent viewers did, and whether regular viewers of the show interacted more with other shows than did children who were not.<ref name="anderson184185"/>  They found that when the content of a program was new and challenging, children paid more attention, and when it was familiar, either from previous viewings or in a format they recognized, they instead interacted more.  In short, they found that "interaction in ''Blue's Clues'' to some extent reflects mastery".<ref name="anderson185186"/>  A similar study, also conducted in 2000 by many of the same researchers, found that experienced ''Blue's Clues'' viewers interacted more with other educational programs than did inexperienced viewers, which proved that watching ''Blue's Clues'' changed the way children watch television.<ref name="anderson-186"/> Researcher Shalom M. Fisch, however, stated that although the show attempted to be "participatory", it could not truly be so, because unlike interactive computer games, the viewers' responses could not change or influence what occurred on-screen.<ref name="learning"/>

Jennings Bryant conducted a two-year longitudinal study of the effects of ''Blue's Clues'' at the [[University of Alabama]] in 2001, to ascertain whether or not the show's curriculum goals were achieved.  He compared regular viewers and nonviewers and found that the show's episode repetition strategy improved children's comprehension while holding their attention and increasing their participation, which suggested that watching ''Blue's Clues'' increased children's learning and social interactions.  At the end of the study, regular viewers outperformed the non-viewers, solving problems more successfully and systematically.<ref name="media-46"/>  Anderson stated, "Given the program's large audience, it appears that the program is not only doing well, but it is also doing good".<ref name="anderson-192"/>

In 2002, Crawley, Anderson, and their colleagues conducted another study on the effects of ''Blue's Clues'', this time researching whether more experienced viewers mastered the content and cognitive challenges faster and easier than first-time viewers.  They surmised that experienced viewers would comprehend and interact more with the recurring and familiar segments of the show designed to aid comprehension,<ref name="crawley266268"/> but found that familiarity with the structure of an individual episode did not provide experienced viewers with an advantage over the inexperienced viewers.  Crawley and Anderson also studied whether experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted more with other children's TV shows,<ref name="crawley-274275"/> and whether the viewing behaviors they learned from ''Blue's Clues'' could be transferred to other shows.<ref name="crawley-278"/>  They found that although experienced viewers of ''Blue's Clues'' interacted with an episode of another series, they did not spend more time watching it than viewers unfamiliar with the show.  The researchers stated, "It is apparent that, although preschoolers learn to enthusiastically engage in overt audience participation, they do not, by and large, have a metacognitive understanding of why they do so."<ref name="crawley-278"/>  The 2002 studies demonstrated that experience with watching one TV series affects how children watch other programs, especially in the way they interact with them.<ref name="crawley-278"/>  They also showed that since children are selective in the material they attend to and that their interaction increases with comprehension and mastery, children tend to pay more attention to novel information and interact more with material they have seen before and mastered.  The researchers predicted that since shows like ''Blue's Clues'' help children feel empowered to learn, it could have long-term effects in motivating children to learn and provide them with a lifelong love of learning.<ref name="crawley-279"/>

Erin Ryan and her colleagues performed a 2009 study on the effect of the use of American Sign Language (ASL) in ''Blue's Clues'' episodes.  They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used, and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs.<ref name="ryan-17"/><ref name="ryan-20"/>  The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either.  The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals.  Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication.  They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated, and provide them with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.<ref name="ryan-17"/>

Georgene L. Troseth and her colleagues at [[Vanderbilt University]] studied how toddlers use information gained from pre-recorded video and from interactions with a person through closed-circuit video, and found that two-year olds do not learn as much from pre-recorded videos because the videos lack social cues and personal references.<ref name="troseth-786"/>  Two-year olds who viewed a pretaped video with instructions about how to find a toy in an adjoining room by a non-interactive researcher did not use the information, even though they smiled and responded to questions. Troseth speculated that their research had implications for interactive educational shows like ''Blue's Clues'', which although was "on the right track"<ref name="troseth-796"/> due to the way in which the host invites interaction with the show's viewers, did not provide children with the social cues to solve real-world problems.   Troseth stated that repetition, repeated exposure, and familiarity with the show's host may increase children's ability to learn facts and to use strategies they learn from ''Blue's Clues'' to solve new problems.  Her research suggested that ''Blue's Clues'' engageed young children and elicited their active participation because they mimicked social interaction.<ref name="troseth-796"/>  A longitudinal study published in 2005 found that early exposure to ''Blue's Clues'' to children between six and thirty months of age was positively linked with vocabulary and expressive language later learned.<ref name="media-49"/>
