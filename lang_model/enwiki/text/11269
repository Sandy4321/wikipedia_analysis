Casting Crowns' lead vocalist [[Mark Hall (musician)|Mark Hall]] explained that: "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. We cut ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/article.php?article_id=123|title=Behind the Song with Kevin Davis|last=Davis|first=Kevin|date=5 April 2008|publisher=New Release Tuesday|accessdate=5 March 2012}}</ref> In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life.
