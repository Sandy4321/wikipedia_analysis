'''Boron nitride''' is a [[chemical compound]], consisting of equal numbers of [[boron]] and [[nitrogen]] atoms; its [[chemical formula]] is therefore BN. When boron and nitrogen atoms are bonded together they have the same number of electrons as [[carbon]] atoms and therefore, like carbon, exist in various [[Polymorphism (materials science)|crystalline forms]]. The [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal form]] corresponds to [[graphite]] - it is the most stable and softest among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic ([[Zincblende_(crystal_structure)#Zincblende_structure|sphalerite structure]]) variety called c-BN is analogous to [[diamond]]. Its hardness is inferior only to diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare [[wurtzite]] BN modification is similar to [[lonsdaleite]] and may even be harder than the cubic form. 

Boron nitride is not found in nature and is therefore produced synthetically from [[boric acid]] or [[boron trioxide]]. The initial product is amorphous BN powder, which is converted to crystalline h-BN by heating in nitrogen flow at temperatures above 1500 <U+00B0>C. c-BN is made by annealing h-BN powder at higher temperatures, under pressures above 5 GPa. Contrary to diamond, larger c-BN pellets can be produced by fusing ([[sintering]]) relatively cheap c-BN powders. As a result, c-BN is widely used in mechanical applications. 

Because of excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has a great potential in nanotechnology. Nanotubes of BN can be produced that have a structure similar to that of [[carbon nanotube]]s, i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, however the properties are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a wide bandgap of ~5.5 eV (same as in diamond), which is almost independent of tube chirality and morphology. Similar to other BN forms, BN nanotubes are more thermally and chemically stable than carbon nanotubes which favors them for applications.

Boron nitride has been produced in an amorphous (a-BN) and several crystalline forms. The most stable crystalline form is the [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] one, also called h-BN, <U+03B1>-BN, or g-BN (graphitic BN). It has a layered structure similar to graphite. Within each layer, boron and nitrogen atoms are bound by strong [[covalent bond]]s, whereas the layers are held together by weak [[van der Waals force]]s. The interlayer "registry" of these sheets differs, however, from the pattern seen for graphite, because the atoms are eclipsed, with boron atoms lying over and above nitrogen atoms.  This registry reflects the polarity of the B-N bonds. Still, h-BN and graphite are very close neighbors and even the BC<sub>6</sub>N hybrids have been synthesized where carbon substitutes for some B and N atoms.<ref>{{cite journal|author =M. Kawaguchi et al.| title = Electronic structure and intercalation chemistry of graphite-like layered material with a composition of BC6N | journal = Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids| volume = 69 |year= 2008 |page = 1171| doi = 10.1016/j.jpcs.2007.10.076}}</ref>

As diamond is less stable than graphite, cubic BN is less stable than h-BN, but the conversion rate between those forms is negligible at room temperature. The cubic form has the [[sphalerite]] crystal structure, same as diamond structure, and is also called <U+03B2>-BN or c-BN. The [[wurtzite]] BN form (w-BN) has similar structure as lonsdaleite, rare hexagonal polymorph of carbon. In both c-BN and w-BN boron and nitrogen atoms are grouped into [[tetrahedra]], but the angles between neighboring tetrahedra are different.<ref>{{cite book| author = M. S.

The partly [[ionic]] structure of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite.  The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence of color and a large [[band gap]]. Very different bonding - strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them - causes high [[anisotropy]] of most properties of h-BN. For example, the hardness, electrical and thermal conductivity are much higher within the planes than perpendicular to them. On the contrary, the properties of c-BN and w-BN are more homogeneous. Those materials are extremely hard, with the hardness of c-BN being slightly smaller and w-BN even higher than that of diamond.<ref>{{cite journal| author =Z.

===Thermal stability===
Hexagonal and cubic (and probably w-BN) BN show remarkable chemical and thermal stabilities. For example, h-BN is stable to decomposition in temperatures up to 1000 <U+00B0>C in air, 1400 <U+00B0>C in vacuum, and 2800 <U+00B0>C in an inert atmosphere. The reactivity of h-BN and c-BN is relatively similar, and the data for c-BN are summarized in the table below.

Thermal stability of c-BN can be summarized as follows:<ref name=BN/>
*In air or oxygen: B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> protective layer prevents further oxidation to ~1300 <U+00B0>C; no conversion to hexagonal form at 1400 <U+00B0>C.
*In nitrogen: some conversion to h-BN at 1525 <U+00B0>C after 12 h.
*In vacuum (10<sup><U+2212>5</sup> Pa): conversion to h-BN at 1550 - 1600 <U+00B0>C.

===Chemical stability===
Boron nitride is insoluble in usual acids, but is soluble in alkaline molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, Li<sub>3</sub>N, Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, Sr<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, Ba<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> or Li<sub>3</sub>BN<sub>2</sub>, which are therefore used to etch BN.<ref name=BN/>

==Synthesis==
Boron nitride has not been found in nature and therefore is produced synthetically. The most common raw materials for BN synthesis, [[boric acid]] and [[boron trioxide]] are produced on industrial scales by treating minerals [[borax]] and [[colemanite]] with [[sulfuric acid]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]:

Boron trioxide is obtained by heating boric acid.<ref>{{cite book | last =Patnaik | first =Pradyot  | year = 2003 | title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds | publisher = McGraw-Hill | page = 119| isbn =0070494398 |  url= http://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&pg=PA119 | accessdate = 2009-06-06}}</ref>

===Preparation and reactivity of hexagonal BN===
Hexagonal boron nitride is obtained by the reacting boron trioxide (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) or boric acid (B(OH)<sub>3</sub>) with [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) or [[urea]] (CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) in nitrogen atmosphere:<ref name=prod>{{cite journal| author= S.

The resulting disordered ([[amorphous]]) boron nitride contains 92-95% BN and 5-8% B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The remaining B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> can be evaporated in a second step at temperatures >1500<U+00B0>C in order to achieve BN concentration >98%. Such annealing also crystallizes BN, the size of the crystallites increasing with the annealing temperature.<ref name=dkg/><ref>{{cite web|url =http://hubacek.jp/bn/bn.htm|accessdate=2009-06-06|title=Synthesis of Boron Nitride from Oxide Precursors}}</ref>

===Preparation of cubic BN===
Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods as that of diamond: Cubic boron nitride is produced by treating hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as [[synthetic diamond]] is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18 GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230 <U+00B0>C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion.<ref name=wentorf>{{cite journal| author = R.

Low-pressure deposition of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, the major problem is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this is achieved by adding hydrogen gas, [[boron trifluoride]] is used for c-BN. [[Ion beam deposition]], [[plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition]], [[pulsed laser deposition]], [[Sputter deposition|reactive sputtering]], and other [[physical vapor deposition]] methods are used as well.<ref name=cvd/>

Both c-BN and w-BN are formed by compressing h-BN, but formation of w-BN occurs at much low temperatures close to 1700 <U+00B0>C.<ref name=vel/>

===Production statistics===
Whereas the production and consumption figures for the raw materials used for BN synthesis, namely boric acid and boron trioxide, are well known (see [[boron]]), the corresponding numbers for the boron nitride are not listed in statistical reports. An estimate for the 1999 world production is 300 to 350 metric tons. The major producers and consumers of BN are located in the United States, Japan, China and Germany. In 2000, prices varied from about US$ 75/kg to $120/kg for standard industrial-quality h-BN and were about up to $200<U+2013>$400/kg for high purity BN grades.<ref name=prod/>

Hexagonal BN is the most widely used polymorph. It is a good lubricant at both low and high temperatures (up to 900 <U+00B0>C, even in an oxidizing atmosphere).  h-BN lubricant is particularly useful when the electrical conductivity or chemical reactivity of graphite (alternative lubricant) would be problematic. Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in [[cosmetics]], [[paint]]s, dental cements, and [[pencil]] leads.<ref name=b1>{{cite book| author = Jochen Greim, Karl A. Schwetz |title = Boron Carbide, Boron Nitride, and Metal Borides, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher = Wiley-VCH: Weinheim |year = 2005 |doi = 10.1002/14356007.a04_295.pub2}}</ref>  

Hexagonal BN was first used in cosmetics around 1940 in [[Japan]]. However, because of its high price, h-BN was soon abandoned for this application . Its use was revitalized in the late 1990s with the optimization h-BN production processes, and currently h-BN is used by nearly all leading producers of cosmetic products for [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundations]], [[make-up]], [[eye shadow]]s, blushers, kohl pencils, [[lipstick]]s and other skincare products.<ref name=dkg/>

Because of its excellent thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used as parts of high-temperature equipment. h-BN can be included in ceramics, alloys, resins, plastics, rubbers, and other materials, giving them self-lubricating properties. Such materials are suitable for construction of e.g. [[bearing]]s and in steelmaking.<ref name=dkg/> Plastics filled with BN have less thermal expansion, higher thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. Due to its excellent dielectric and thermal properties, BN is used in electronics e.g. as a substrate for semiconductors, microwave-transparent windows, structural material for seals.<ref>{{cite journal| author= R.F. Davis| title = III-V nitrides for electronic and optoelectronic applications| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE| year = 1991| volume= 79| pages = 702<U+2013>712| doi = 10.1109/5.90133}}</ref>

Hexagonal BN is used in [[Xerography|xerographic process]] and [[laser printer]]s as a charge leakage barrier layer of the photo drum.<ref>{{cite book| author = Schein, L.B. |title = Electrophotography and Development Physics, Springer Series in Electrophysics | volume = 14 | publisher = Springer-Verlag, Berlin |year = 1988}}</ref> In the automotive industry, h-BN mixed with a binder (boron oxide) is used for sealing oxygen sensors, which provide feedback for adjusting fuel flow. The binder utilizes the unique temperature stability and insulating properties of h-BN.<ref name=dkg/>

===Cubic boron nitride===
Cubic boron nitride is widely used as an [[abrasive]].<ref name="mprg">{{cite book| author = Todd, Robert H and Allen, Dell K. | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide |year= 1994 |page = 43-48 |publisher = Industrial Press Inc}}</ref>  Its usefulness arises from its insolubility in [[iron]], [[nickel]], and related [[alloys]] at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide.  Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used in the [[tool bit]]s of [[cutting tool]]s.  For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used.  Ceramic binders can be used as well.  Commercial products are known under names "[[Borazon]]" (by Diamond Innovations), and "Elbor" or "Cubonite" (by Russian vendors). Similar to diamond, the combination in c-BN of highest thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity is ideal for heat spreaders. Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets can be produced in a simple process (called sintering) of annealing c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature. This ability of c-BN and h-BN powders to fuse allows cheap production of large BN parts.<ref name=b1/>

As cubic boron nitride consists of light atoms and is very robust chemically and mechanically, it is one of the popular materials for X-ray membranes: low mass results in small X-ray absorption, and good mechanical properties allow usage of thin membranes, thus further reducing the absorption.<ref>{{cite journal| author = M. A. El Khakani and M. Chaker

===Amorphous boron nitride===
Layers of amorphous boron nitride (a-BN) are used in some [[semiconductor devices]], e.g. [[MISFET]]s. They can be prepared by chemical decomposition of [[trichloroborazine]] with [[cesium]], or by thermal chemical vapor deposition methods. Thermal CVD can be also used for deposition of h-BN layers, or at high temperatures, c-BN. <ref>{{cite journal| author= W. Schmolla | title = Positive drift effect of BN-InP enhancement n-channel MISFET| doi =10.1080/00207218508939000 |journal =International Journal of Electronics |volume =58 |year =1985 |page = 35}}</ref>

==Other BN forms==
===Boron nitride fibers===
Hexagonal BN can be prepared in the form of fibers, structurally similar to [[carbon fiber]]s, by thermal decomposition of extruded [[borazine]] (B<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) fibers with addition of boron oxide in a nitrogen atmosphere at 1800 <U+00B0>C.  An alternative method is thermal decomposition of [[cellulose]] fibers impregnated with boric acid or [[ammonium tetraborate]] in an atmosphere of ammonia and nitrogen above 1000 <U+00B0>C. Boron nitride fibers are used as reinforcement in [[composite material]]s, with the matrix materials ranging from organic resins to ceramics to metals (see [[Metal matrix composites]]).<ref>{{cite journal| author = T. S. Bartnitskaya| title = Preparation of boron nitride fibers with the use of hydrated cellulose. I.

{{main|Nanomesh}}
[[nanomesh|Boron nitride nanomesh]] is a [[inorganic]] nanostructured two-dimensional material.

The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores. The distance between 2 pore centers is 3.2&nbsp;nm and the pore diameter is ~2&nbsp;nm.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===
{{seealso|carbon nanotube}}
A boron nitride nanotube can be imagined as a rolled on itself graphite-like sheet, where carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. Structurally, it is a close analog of the [[carbon nanotube]], namely a long cylinder with diameter of several to hundred nanometers and length of many microns. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure.<ref name=golberg>{{cite journal| author = Golberg D., Bando Y., Tang C.C., Zhi C.Y. |title = Boron nitride nanotubes | doi = 10.1002/adma.200700179 |journal = Adv. Mater. |volume = 19 | year =2007 |page = 2413}}</ref>
 
All reliable and well-established techniques of carbon nanotube growth, e.g. arc-discharge, laser ablation, and chemical vapor deposition, do not effectively work for BN nanotubes.<ref name=golberg/> However, the latter can be produced by [[ball mill]]ing of amorphous boron, mixed with a catalyst - iron powder, under NH<sub>3</sub> atmosphere. Subsequent annealing at ~1100 <U+00B0>C in nitrogen flow transforms most of the product into BN nanotubes. <ref name=Au/><ref name=eu/>

Electrical and field emission properties of the thus prepared nanotubes can be tuned by doping with gold atoms via sputtering of gold on the nanotubes.<ref name=Au>{{cite journal| author= H.

Like BN fibers, boron nitride nanotubes show promise for aerospace applications where integration of boron and in particular the light isotope of boron (<sup>10</sup>B) into structural materials improves their radiation-shielding properties; the improvement is due to strong neutron absorption by <sup>10</sup>B. Such <sup>10</sup>BN materials are of particular theoretical value as composite structural materials in future manned interplanetary spacecraft, where absorption-shielding from cosmic ray spallation neutrons is expected to be a particular asset in light construction materials.<ref>{{cite journal|author= J.

===Composites containing BN===
Addition of boron nitride to [[silicon nitride]] ceramics improves the [[thermal shock]] resistance of the resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-[[alumina]] and [[titanium nitride]]-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN are, e.g., alumina and [[zirconia]], [[borosilicate glass]]es, [[glass ceramic]]s, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, and composite ceramics with [[titanium boride]]-boron nitride and titanium boride-[[aluminium nitride]]-boron nitride and [[silicon carbide]]-boron nitride composition.<ref>{{cite book| title = Handbook of Composite Reinforcements | author = S. M. Lee| publisher = John Wiley and Sons |year = 1992 |isbn = 0471188611}}</ref>

==Health issues==
Boron nitride (along with Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, NbN, and BNC) is reported to show weak [[fibrigenic]] activity and cause [[pneumoconiosis]]. The maximum concentration recommended for nitrides of nonmetals is 10&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> for BN and 4 for AlN or ZrN.<ref name=BN/>
