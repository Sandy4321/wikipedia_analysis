[[File:Pah Wongso with Chinese flag.jpg|thumb|Pah Wongso in 1938, while raising funds for China]]
'''Louis Victor Wijnhamer, Jr.''' (11 February 1904 <U+2013> 1974), better known as '''Pah Wongso''' ({{zh|c=<U+4F2F><U+738B><U+68AD>|p=B<U+00F3> W<U+00E1>ngsu<U+014D>}}), was an [[Indo people|Indo]] social worker popular within the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] community of what was initially the [[Dutch East Indies]], and subsequently became Indonesia. Educated in [[Semarang]] and [[Surabaya]], Wongso began his social work in the early 1930s, using traditional arts such as ''[[wayang golek]]'' to promote such causes as monogamy and abstinence. By 1938 he had established a school for the poor, and was raising money for the [[Red Cross]] to send aid to China. 

In late 1938, Wongso used a legal defense fund, which had been raised for him when he was charged with extortion, in order to establish another school; this was followed by an employment center in 1939. In 1941, [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]] released two productions starring him and featuring his name in the title. During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], Wongso was held in a series of concentration camps in South-East Asia. He returned to the then-independent Indies by 1948, and raised funds for the Red Cross and ran an employment office until his death in 1974.

==Early life and social work==
Louis Victor Wijnhamer, Jr., was born on 11 February 1904 in [[Tegal, Central Java]], the [[Dutch East Indies]].{{sfn|Registration card}} One of three siblings, Wijnhamer was born to an ethnic Dutch administrator from [[Surabaya]], Louis Victor Wijnhamer, Sr., and J. F. Inen;{{sfn|Registration card}}{{sfn|De Indische courant 1941, Wie}} he was of [[Indo people|Indo]] descent.{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=65}} He studied at the [[Hogere Burgerschool|senior high school]] in [[Semarang]], before spending some time at the Suikerschool in Surabaya, later arriving in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]). There, between 1927 and 1937, he worked as an [[amanuensis]] at the [[STOVIA|School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen]].{{sfn|De Indische courant 1941, Wie}}

By the early 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as Pah Wongso,{{efn|In [[Javanese language|Javanese]], the word ''wongso'' (Indonesian: ''bangsa'') means "people" {{harv|Barnard|2010|p=65}}.}} was recognised in [[West Java]] for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy and faith in western medicine, as well as combating gambling and the use of opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese ''[[wayang golek]]'' (a form of shadow puppets), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from Wongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (''kacang goreng'').{{sfn|Volk en Vaderland 1936}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Nieuws}}

By 1938 Wongso had married an ethnic Chinese woman and opened a school for poor children, particularly those of mixed Chinese descent, in Gang Patikee; it was funded by donations. He was also a member of the Indies branch of the [[Red Cross]], and recognized for his humanitarian work.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Nieuws}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Pah Wongso}} He organised night fairs in various cities in the Indies (including in [[Yogyakarta]], Semarang, and Surabaya), holding auctions and selling drinks and snacks in order to raise money to send aid to China, then [[Second Sino-Japanese War|fighting against the Japanese]].{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Pah Wongso}}

==Establishment of schools and popularity==
[[File:Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster for ''[[Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman]]'' (1941); Wongso's popularity was such that two films bearing his name were released by [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]].]]
After one of these fairs, in Yogyakarta, Wongso was arrested for writing a threatening letter to Liem Tek Hien, who refused to pay [[Netherlands Indies gulden|f.]]&nbsp;10 for a walking stick he said that he had not purchased, and held at Struiswijk Prison in Batavia.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Pah Wongso}}{{Sfn|Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1938, 'Pah Wongso'}}{{sfn|De Indische courant 1938, Pah Wongso}} He was charged with "attempted extortion and unpleasant treatment".{{efn|Original: "''... poging tot afpersing en onaangename bejegening''"}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Pah Wongso voor}} The case was widely followed by ethnic Chinese in the Indies, and the magazine ''Keng Po'' established a defense fund for Wongso, which raised more than f.&nbsp;1,300 by mid-June 1938; this had reached almost f.&nbsp;2,000 by the end of the month.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Pah Wongso voor}} The case was brought to trial on 24 June 1938. Although Liem regretted reporting Wongso to the police, the prosecutor called for a two-month sentence, while the defence asked for an acquittal, or time served.{{sfn|Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1938, 'Pah Wongso'}}{{sfn|De Sumatra post 1938, Tegen}}{{sfn|De Indische courant 1938, Pah Wongso}}

Ultimately, on 28 June 1938 the judge gave a sentence of one month&nbsp;<U+2013> equal to the time Wongso had served&nbsp;<U+2013> and he was released.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Zijn}} Wongso appealed the court sentence, calling for an acquittal;{{sfn|De Indische courant 1938, Pah Wongso in Hooger Beroep}} in August 1938 his sentence was reduced to a 25-cent fine.{{sfn|De Indische courant 1938, Pah Wongso}} The defense fund collected by ''Keng Po'', totaling almost f.&nbsp;3,500 by August, was allocated to the establishment of a school;{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1938, Zijn}} on 8 August 1938 the Pah Wongso Cr<U+00E8>ches school for impoverished youth opened at 20 Blandongan St. in Batavia.{{sfn|Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1938, Pah Wongso Cr<U+00E8>ches}}{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled advertisement 1)|loc=obverse, reverse}} By the end of the year Wongso had participated in a march on opium use and been featured in a special issue of ''Fu Len''.{{sfn|Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1938, Anti-Opium}}{{sfn|De Indische courant 1938, Fu Len}}

In 1939 Wongso expanded his school in Blandongan to include an employment office. Established with f.&nbsp;1,000, the office was located above the school and by November 1939 was training 22 job seekers. The Pah Wongso Cr<U+00E8>ches, meanwhile, served more than 200 ethnic Chinese and [[Native Indonesians|indigene]] students.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1939, Nieuw Tehuis}} He continued speaking out against the working conditions in the Indies, giving a lecture to a 1,000-strong audience at the Queens Theatre in Batavia in October 1939. He remained highly popular with the ethnic Chinese.{{Sfn|Het nieuws van den dag voor Nederlandsch-Indi<U+00EB> 1939, Een Volksbijeenkomst}}

In 1941, [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]] made two films starring Wongso, in order to take advantage of his popularity. The first, ''[[Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman]]'' (''Pah Wongso the Cultured Warrior''), depicted him as a nut seller who investigates the murder of a rich [[hajji]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso}}{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} It was released to popular acclaim, although the journalist [[Saeroen]] suggest this was predominantly because of Wongso's existing popularity within the Chinese community.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=247}} A second film, a comedy titled ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'', depicted Wongso as a suspect in an investigation and was released in December 1941.{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Tirai Terbentang}} Writing in the magazine ''Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film'', "S." praised the introduction of comedy to the Indies' film industry, and expressed hope that the film would "leave audiences rolling with laughter".{{efn|Original: "''membikin orang tertawa terpingkal-pingkal''"}}{{sfn|S.|1941|p=15}}

==Later life==
[[File:Pah Wongso's Japanese occupation registration card.jpg|thumb|upright|Wongso's registration card with the Japanese occupation forces, 1945]]
In March 1942, the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the Dutch East Indies. Wongso was captured in [[Bandung]] on 8 March,{{sfn|Registration card}} and spent three years in a series of concentration camps in South-East Asia, including in Thailand, Singapore and [[British Malaya|Malaya]].{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled advertisement 1)|loc=obverse}} He returned to the Indies, now independent and known as Indonesia, by 1948, when he established the "Tulung Menulung" (literally "mutual assistance") social office;{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled postcard 2)}} he also worked for [[Sharp's Commercials|Bond Motors]]' Jakarta branch.{{sfn|KITLV, Inventory|p=1}} In the mid-1950s he met President [[Sukarno]],{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled postcard 1)}} and by 1957 a biography of Pah Wongso was for sale.{{sfn|Java Bode 1957, Wie}} He and his wife Gouw Tan Nio (also known as Leny Wijnhamer) had their fifth child<!--Lily--> on 3 February 1955.{{sfn|De nieuwsgier 1955, Familieberichten}}

Wongso continued to raise money for the Red Cross by selling fried peanuts.{{sfn|De nieuwsgier 1954, Boksen}} He also continued to operate his school in Blandongan, as well as the employment office, which trained young men and women for positions such as maids, gardeners, and bellhops, then placed them with employers. Several of Wongso's students came from islands other than [[Java]]. ''De Nieuwsgier'' gave the story of one young man, from [[Bengkulu]], who had come to Java to study, been robbed of all his possessions while in Jakarta, then been helped by Wongso to find work.{{sfn|De nieuwsgier 1954, Abdul}}

Wongso continued operating his school and employment office, under the auspices of the Pah Wongso Foundation, into the 1970s. He touted that the foundation had found positions for 1,000 young women and 11,000 young men,{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled advertisement 1)|loc=obverse, reverse}} and advertisements offering to place labourers were issued in Indonesian, English, and Dutch.{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled advertisement 2)}} The institution also provided printing services; wrote letters on demand in English, Dutch, and Indonesian;{{Sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled advertisement 3)}} and provided ''[[wayang]]'' performances with four kinds of puppets.{{sfn|Pah Wongso Foundation, (untitled postcard 3)}} Wongso died in Jakarta in 1974.{{sfn|KITLV, Inventory|p=1}}
