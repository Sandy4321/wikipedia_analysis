'''Michael John Lockwood'''<ref name="OWOW">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/c/crash-holly.html|title=Crash Holly Profile|accessdate=2008-03-06|publisher=Online World Of Wrestling}}</ref> (August 25, 1971 - November 6, 2003)<ref name="Slambio"/> was an [[United States|American]] [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] best known for his time with [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment]] (WWF/E) under the ring name '''Crash Holly'''.<ref name="Slambio"/>

Lockwood wrestled on the [[Independent circuit]], and briefly for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], before he signed a contract with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1999. He debuted as [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]]'s [[Kayfabe|on-screen]] cousin, "Crash Holly". Lockwood earned his greatest success in WWE's [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore division]], winning the title 22 times, leading to him being nicknamed "The Houdini Of Hardcore". In June 2003, he was released from WWE and joined [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] as "Mad Mikey", but died in November 2003, just four months after debuting.

In WWF/E, he was a [[List of WWE European Champions|one-time]] [[WWE European Championship|European Champion]],<ref name="WWE European"/> a [[List of WWF Light Heavyweight Champions|one-time]] [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship|Light Heavyweight Champion]],<ref name="WWE Light Heavyweight"/> and a [[List of WWE Hardcore Champions|22-time]] [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Champion]].<ref name="WWE Hardcore"/> He was also a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Champion]] with [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] as part of the [[tag team]] [[The Holly Cousins]].<ref name="WWE Tag"/>

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career===
Lockwood made his wrestling debut in 1989, as "Johnny Pearson" in Bay Area Wrestling, where he competed until 1994.<ref name="Slambio"/> He dislocated his shoulder about five times, and ended up having to take a year and a half out to recover.<ref name="digest-interview"/> He then competed on the [[independent circuit]] as "Irish Erin O'Grady", and in 1996, moved to [[All Pro Wrestling]] (APW), where he became known as "The Leprechaun Erin O'Grady".<ref name="digest-interview"/> Lockwood became especially famous for his matches with [[Vic Grimes]].<ref name="OWOW"/>

After viewing a tape of a match between O'Grady and [[Michael Modest]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) employee Taz ([[Tazz|Peter Senerchia]]) contacted Lockwood about joining ECW. This resulted in Lockwood having a brief stint there.<ref name="OWOW"/> Lockwood wrestled Grimes in a try-out match for the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on February 20, 1999, and both were signed to contracts.<ref name="digest-interview"/> They were sent to Power Pro Wrestling, WWF's [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|farm territory]] to train, where they won the PPW Tag Team Championship together.<ref name="PPWtag"/> Lockwood also won the PPW Young Guns Championship.<ref name="PPWyoung-guns"/> The WWF talent coordinator [[Bruce Prichard]], also sent Lockwood to Mexico, to prepare him for the style of the WWF's Spanish show.<ref name="digest-interview"/> He competed in [[Monterrey]] for three months, under a [[Lucha libre#Masks|mask]], using the alias "The Green Ghost", a play on the word "[[gringo]]".<ref name="digest-interview"/>

[[Image:Cholly_lockwood.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Crash Holly had a gimmick where he weighed 400&nbsp;lbs.]]
Lockwood debuted as Crash Holly, the [[Kayfabe|on-screen]] cousin of Bob "Hardcore" Holly ([[Bob Holly|Robert Howard]]), on the August 16 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'' in 1999.<ref name="digest-interview"/> The relationship between the [[Kayfabe|on-screen]] cousins was strained, with Hardcore frequently threatening Holly.<ref name="Slambio"/> He was often seen carrying a [[weighing scale]] when he took on the [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]] of claiming himself to be well over 400&nbsp;lbs, along with Hardcore, so that they would be considered heavyweights.<ref name="Slambio"/> Holly, teaming with Hardcore as "[[The Holly Cousins]]", made his [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] in 1999. The pair participated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Gauntlet match|Tag Team Turmoil match]], a match where when one team was eliminated, they were replaced by another, won by the [[Acolytes Protection Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|title=Foley new champ at SummerSlam|last=Powell|first=John|accessdate=2008-09-26|publisher=SLAM!

In early 2000, Holly joined the [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore division]] and went on to win the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] [[List of WWE Hardcore Champions|22 times]], with his first title win coming on the February 24, 2000, edition of ''SmackDown!'' when he defeated Test ([[Andrew Martin]]) for the title.<ref name="WWE Hardcore"/> Holly decreed that he must [[WWE Hardcore Championship#Hardcore rules|defend the championship twenty four hours a day, seven days a week]] ("24/7").<ref name="Slambio"/> This meant that the title was permanently contested, not just in the course of sanctioned matches, and could therefore change hands anywhere, as long as a referee was present to administer the three count. Holly was frequently attacked by other wrestlers while in unlikely locations, including an airport, a funhouse, a circus, and even in his hotel room.<ref name="digest-interview"/> While Holly was often [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]], he normally immediately regained the title from his opponent.<ref name="WWE Hardcore"/> His most common tactic was to steal a win in one of his or someone else's Hardcore Championship match and quick run away to the back, away from other contenders.<ref name="WWE Hardcore"/> This [[List of professional wrestling terms#T|turned]] him into a crowd favorite and earned him the nickname of the "[[Harry Houdini|Houdini]] of Hardcore".<ref name="houdini">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0516996/bio|title=Michael Lockwood|accessdate=2008-11-15|publisher=IMDB}}</ref> During his time in the hardcore division, he had a long standing [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with the members of the [[Mean Street Posse]], Pete Gas ([[Peter Gasperino]]), Rodney ([[Rodney Leinhardt]]), and Joey Abs ([[Jason Arhndt]]).<ref name="WWE Hardcore"/> Holly also became well known for defending the championships against non-wrestlers, including referees and [[Road agent (professional wrestling)|road agents]] like Gerald Brisco ([[Gerald Brisco|Floyd Brisco]]) and Pat Patterson ([[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pierre Clemont]]).<ref name="Slambio"/>

In late 2000, Holly's on-screen cousin Molly Holly ([[Nora Greenwald]]) was introduced. At [[WWE Rebellion#2000|Rebellion]], Holly defeated William Regal ([[Darren Matthews]]) to win the [[WWE European Championship|WWF European Championship]].<ref name="WWE European"/> He, however, dropped the title back to Regal only two days later.<ref name="WWE European"/> In 2001, the Holly Cousins began a feud with [[Dudley Boyz|The Dudley Boyz]].<ref name="slam-molly"/> In the course of this feud, Molly began a relationship with Spike Dudley ([[Matt Hyson]]), leading to internal disputes within each family, as well as a [[Romeo and Juliet]]-style feud between the six of them.<ref name="slam-molly">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosH/holly_molly_01jun30-can.html|title=Molly Holly having a blast in the WWF|last=Molinaro|first=John F.|accessdate=2008-09-26|publisher=SLAM!
