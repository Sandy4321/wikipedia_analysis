'''Timothy Harold "Tim" Vom Steeg''' is an [[United States|American]] [[college soccer|collegiate soccer]] [[head coach]] who is currently with the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] [[UCSB Soccer|men's soccer]] team.  He has been with the Gauchos since 1999 and is the most successful coach in the history of UC Santa Barbara.  He won the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup]] and was runner-up in the [[2004 Division I Men's College Cup]], as well as being named the 2004 and 2006 [[NSCAA Coach of the Year]].

==Personal life==
Vom Steeg resides in [[Santa Barbara, California]] and is married to Almeria Vom Steeg.  They have four sons together (Justin, Carson, and twins Caden and Jared).  He graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1989 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]].  In 2000, he received a [[master's degree]] from UC Santa Barbara.

==Playing career==
Vom Steeg played for UC Santa Barbara from 1985 to 1988 under coach Andy Kuenzli.  He did not seek to go professional.  Instead, he took his knowledge of the game and parlayed it into a coaching job.

==Coaching career==

===Santa Barbara City College===
Vom Steeg's first head coaching job came in 1992 when he was named head coach of [[Santa Barbara City College]].  With the Vaqueros, Vom Steeg won five [[Western State Conference]] as well as the 1996 California Community College State Championship.  Vom Steeg also led SBCC to four State Final Fours.  The team went 121-18-4 (.846) overall under Vom Steeg's reign, which ended in 1998.

Personally, Vom Steeg was the [[Western State Conference|WSC]] Coach of the Year five times out of seven years.  He was also named the State Coach of the Year in 1996 as well as the [[NSCAA Far West Region Coach of the Year]] in 1997.

===UC Santa Barbara===
Vom Steeg was hired as the head coach of UC Santa Barbara, his [[alma mater#Uses in academia|alma mater]], in 1999.  He took the program over from Mark Arya, who from 1992 through 1998 amassed a 40-84-6 (.331) record.  Vom Steeg delivered immediate results, improving upon a 2-17-1 (0-8-1 conference) record under Arya's last year in 1998 to finish the 1999 season with a 13-7-0 (4-3-0 conference) record.  The feat saw Vom Steeg named an [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation|MPSF]] Pacific Division Co-Coach of the Year.

The following seasons saw the Gauchos steadily improve, culminating in the school's first [[Big West Conference]] Championship in 2001, Vom Steeg's third year in charge.  Not satisfied with the accomplishments of the team, Vom Steeg improved the 7-2-1 conference record from 2001 and turned it into a 9-0-1 conference record in 2002, giving UC Santa Barbara its second Big West title in a row.  2002 also saw the Gauchos reach the NCAA Tournament for the first time in school history, reaching the 2nd round.  In 2003, Vom Steeg and UCSB lost the Big West title to rivals [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State Northridge]], but advanced to the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament.

In 2004, Tim Vom Steeg and UC Santa Barbara were firmly put on the map as a bona fide college soccer powerhouse.  The Gauchos compiled an 8-2-0 conference record to recapture the Big West title from Northridge.  Vom Steeg led the Gauchos into the [[2004 Division I Men's College Cup]], reaching the finals against [[Indiana Hoosiers#Men's Soccer|Indiana University]] in [[Carson, California]] before falling on penalties.  The showing led to Vom Steeg being named the 2004 [[NSCAA Coach of the Year]].

Vom Steeg became the winningest coach in UCSB soccer history in 2005.  He passed his former collegiate coach Andy Kuenzli (1981<U+2013>89) with his 96th win when the Gauchos defeated [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] in double overtime October 26.  He went on to become the first coach in program history to reach the 100-win plateau after he led that squad to a 2-0 victory over [[San Diego State Aztecs|San Diego State]] in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.

The crowning achievement of Vom Steeg's career came in 2006.  UC Santa Barbara again won the Big West title and made the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup]], however this time they were unseeded.  After defeating [[San Diego State Aztecs|San Diego State]] and #3 seed [[SMU Mustangs#Soccer|SMU]] among others, the Gauchos made it to the College Cup in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to contend for the National Championship.  UCSB defeated #2 seed [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons|Wake Forest]] in penalties, advancing to the championship match against #8 seed and Southern California rival [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]].  UC Santa Barbara won the title by a 2-1 scoreline, giving the Gauchos their first ever NCAA Championship in soccer and only 2nd NCAA title overall (1979 Men's Water Polo).  Vom Steeg was once again named [[NSCAA Coach of the Year]].

UC Santa Barbara had only one All-American player, Dave Hollingsworth in 1970, before Tim Vom Steeg took over the program.  Since his tenure began, that number has jumped into double digits.  [[Rob Friend]], [[Memo Arzate]], [[Alan Keely]], [[Drew McAthy]], [[Tony Lochhead]], [[Dan Kennedy (soccer)|Dan Kennedy]], [[Tyler Rosenlund]], [[Andy Iro]], [[Eric Avila]], and [[Ciaran O'Brien]] have all won All-America accolades while at UCSB under Vom Steeg.

Coach Vom Steeg was suspended 1 game for yelling at a referee after a loss to UC Davis on Oct 28, 2012.  While Vom Steeg was yelling at the referee, Senior Peter McGlynn the shoved referee to the ground and was arrested on the field.
