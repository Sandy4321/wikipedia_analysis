'''''Freak Out!''''', released [[June 27]], [[1966]] on [[MGM Records|MGM]]/[[Verve Records]], is the debut album of [[The Mothers of Invention]], led by [[Frank Zappa]]. A sardonic farce about rock music and America, ''Freak Out!'' was one of the earliest [[concept album]]s. It was also one of the earliest [[double album]]s in the history of [[rock music]]. 

The album was produced by [[Tom Wilson]], who had also produced albums by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Velvet Underground]]. Wilson signed The Mothers, formally a bar band called the Soul Giants, to a record deal in the belief that they were a [[white people|white]] [[blues]] band.<ref name="RFZB">{{cite book | title = The Real Frank Zappa Book | first = Frank | last = Zappa | coauthors = Occhiogrosso, Peter | year = 1989 | publisher = Poseidon Press | location = New York | pages = Pages 65-80 | id = ISBN 0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref name="BBC">Leigh, Nigel.

The band's original repertoire consisted entirely of cover songs. When Zappa joined the band, he not only changed their name, but also expanded their music to include a wide range of original material. The musical content of ''Freak Out!'' ranges from [[rhythm and blues]], [[doo-wop]] and standard [[blues]]-influenced [[Rock music|rock]] to orchestral arrangements and [[avant-garde]] [[sound collage]]s.

Although the album was initially poorly received in the [[United States]], it was a success in [[Europe]], and gained a [[cult following]] in America. The album influenced the production of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.<ref name="SgtPepper">{{cite web |url=http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/sgt-pepper/biography/its-influence |title=''Sgt.

== History ==
In the early 1960s, [[Frank Zappa]] met [[Ray Collins (rock musician)|Ray Collins]]. Collins supported himself by working as a carpenter, and on weekends sang with a group called the Soul Giants. Collins got into a fight with their guitar player, who quit, leaving the band in need of a substitute, and so Zappa filled in.<ref name="RFZB"/><ref name="HitParader">{{cite web |url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/hitparader68.htm |title=The Incredible History Of The Mothers |accessdate=2007-02-09 |author=Zappa, Frank |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=June 1968 |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Hit Parader |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The Soul Giants' repertoire consisted entirely of cover songs. One night, Zappa suggested that the band should start performing original material and try to get a record contract. While most of the bandmembers liked the idea, then-leader and [[saxophone]] player Davy Coronado felt that performing original material would cost them bookings, and quit the band.<ref name="RFZB"/><ref name="BBC"/> The Soul Giants became The Mothers, and Zappa took over leadership of the band.<ref name="RFZB"/> One night, [[MGM Records|MGM]] staff producer [[Tom Wilson]] attended a performance by The Mothers and heard them performing "Trouble Every Day," a song about the [[Watts riots]].<ref name="HitParader"/> As a result, Wilson offered the band a record deal, believing that they were a [[white people|white]] [[blues]] band,<ref name="RFZB"/><ref name="BBC"/> and the group began to work on their first album, ''Freak Out!'' 

==Album production==
The first two songs recorded for the album were "Any Way The Wind Blows" and "Who Are the Brain Police?"<ref name="RFZB"/><ref name="HitParader"/> When Tom Wilson heard the latter, he realized that The Mothers were not a blues band. In ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', Zappa wrote "I could see through the window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss<U+2014>probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a "white blues band," but...sort of.'"<ref name="RFZB"/> In a 1968 article written for ''Hit Parader'' magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called [[New York City|New York]], and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity."<ref name="HitParader"/> ''Freak Out!'' is an early example of the [[concept album]], a sardonic farce about rock music and America. "All the songs on it were about something," Zappa wrote in ''The Real Frank Zappa Book''. "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept."<ref name="RFZB"/>

<blockquote>"If you were to graphically analyze the different types of directions of all the songs in the ''Freak Out!'' album, there's a little something in there for everybody. At least one piece of material is slanted for every type of social orientation within our consumer group, which happens to be six to eighty. Because we got people that like what we do, from kids six years old screaming on us to play 'Wowie Zowie.' Like I meet executives doing this and that, and they say, 'My kid's got the record, and "Wowie Zowie's" their favorite song.'"<ref name="AgeofRock">{{cite book |last=Eisen |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Age of Rock: Sounds of the American Cultural Revolution |year= |publisher=Random House Inc |location= |isbn=100394705351 }}</ref></blockquote>

The entire album was recorded at Sunset-Highland Studios between March 9 and March 12, 1966.<ref name="dates"/> Some songs, such as "Motherly Love" and "I Ain't Got No Heart" had already been recorded before the ''Freak Out!'' sessions. These early recordings, said to have been made around 1965,<ref name="dates"/> were not officially released until 2004, when they appeared on the posthumous Zappa album ''[[Joe's Corsage]]''. An early version of the song "Any Way The Wind Blows," recorded in 1963,<ref name="LO-liner">''The Lost Episodes''. Liner notes. RCD 40573.</ref> appears on another posthumous release, ''[[The Lost Episodes]]''. The song was written when Zappa considered divorcing first wife Kay Sherman.<ref name="LO-liner"/><ref name="FO-liner">Zappa, Frank. ''Freak Out!'' Liner notes. V/V6-5005-2.</ref> In the liner notes for ''Freak Out!'', Zappa wrote "If I had never gotten divorced, this piece of trivial nonsense would never have been recorded."<ref name="FO-liner"/>
[[Image:FZ-studio-FO.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Frank Zappa in the recording studio.]]
Tom Wilson became more enthusiastic as the sessions continued. In the middle of the week of recording, Zappa told him "I would like to rent $500 worth of percussion equipment for a session that starts at midnight on Friday and I want to bring all the freaks from [[Sunset Boulevard]] into the studio to do something special." Wilson agreed. The material was worked into "The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet."<ref name="RFZB"/> According to Zappa, the record label refused to allow him the time needed to complete the composition, and so it was released in unfinished form.<ref name="FO-liner"/><ref>Zappa, Frank. Radio appearance. WDET, Detroit, MI. November 13, 1967.</ref>

Zappa later found out that when the material was recorded, Wilson had taken [[LSD]]. "I've tried to imagine what he must have been thinking, sitting in that control room, listening to all that weird shit coming out of the speakers, and being responsible for telling the engineer, Ami Hadani (who was not on acid), what to do."<ref name="RFZB"/> By the time ''Freak Out!'' was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25-35,000 of MGM's money.<ref name="RFZB"/> In ''Hit Parader'' magazine, Zappa wrote "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album."<ref name="HitParader"/>

The label requested that two lines be removed from the "It Can't Happen Here" section of "Help, I'm a Rock," both of which had been interpreted by MGM executives to be drug references. However, the label either had no objections to, or else did not notice, a sped-up recording of Zappa shouting the word "fuck" after accidentally smashing his finger,<ref name="WRVR">Biberfeld, Matty. Interview with Frank Zappa. WRVR, New York City, NY. Summer, 1967.</ref> occurring at 11 minutes and 39 seconds into "The Return of the Son of Monster Magnet." MGM also told Zappa that the band would have to change their name, claiming that no DJ would ever play a record on the air by a group called "The Mothers."<ref name="RFZB"/><ref name="RS1988">{{cite web |url=http://home.online.no/~corneliu/rs88.htm |title=Interview |accessdate=2007-02-09 |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1988 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

<blockquote>"...at the time, it was, you know, if you were a good musician, you were a motherfucker, and Mothers was short for collection of motherfuckers. And actually, it was kind of presumptuous to name the band that, because we weren't that good musicians, we were . . . But by bar-band standards in the area, we were light-years ahead of our competition, but in terms of real musicianship, I just suppose we were right down there in the swamp." - Frank Zappa<ref name="BBC"/></blockquote> 

''Freak Out!'' was released with the band's name changed to The Mothers of Invention, a name Zappa chose in favor of MGM's original suggested name, "The Mothers Auxiliary."<ref name="MothersAuxiliary">{{cite web |url=http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Joe's_Corsage.html#Pretty |title="Pretty Pat" (Interview excerpted on ''Joe's Corsage'', VR 20041) |accessdate=2007-02-07 |author=Zappa, Frank |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=Unknown date |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The album's back cover included a "letter" from Zappa-created fictional character [[Suzy Creamcheese]] (who also appears on the album itself), which read:
[[Image:FO-era Mothers.jpg|right|thumb|The Mothers of Invention.]]
<blockquote>"These Mothers is crazy. You can tell by their clothes. One guy wears beads and they all smell bad. We were gonna get them for a dance after the basketball game but my best pal warned me you can never tell how many will show up...sometimes the guy in the fur coat doesn't show up and sometimes he does show up only he brings a big bunch of crazy people with him and they dance all over the place. None of the kids at my school like these Mothers...specially since my teacher told us what the words to their songs meant. Sincerely forever, Suzy Creamcheese, Salt Lake City, Utah."<ref name="FO-back">Zappa, Frank. ''Freak Out!'' Back cover. V/V6-5005-2.</ref></blockquote>

Because the text was printed in a typeface resembling typewriter lettering, some people thought that Suzy Creamcheese was real, and many listeners expected to see her in concert performances. Because of this, it was decided that "it would be best to bring along a Suzy Creamcheese replica who would demonstrate once and for all the veracity of such a beast."<ref name="KBEY-FM">Zappa, Frank. Interview. KBEY-FM, Kansas City, MO. October 22, 1971.</ref> Because the original voice of Suzy Creamcheese, Jeanne Vassoir, was unavailable, [[Pamela Zarubica|Pamela Lee Zarubica]] took over the part.<ref name="KBEY-FM"/>

Early pressings of the album included an advertisement for a "''Freak Out'' Hot Spots!" map, which featured commentary on selected areas of 1966-era California. The map was not offered on later pressings,<ref name="ZappaPatio-FO">{{cite web |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/freakout.html |title=Vinyl Vs.

==Response==
''Freak Out!'' was neither a commercial nor critical success when it was first released in the United States.<ref name="BBC"/> When the album was released, listeners were convinced that the album was drug-inspired,<ref name="RFZB"/> and some interpreted the album's title as slang for a bad LSD trip.<ref name="MixedMedia">Zappa, Frank. Interview. Mixed Media, Detroit, MI
November 13, 1967.</ref> In ''The Real Frank Zappa Book'', Zappa quotes a negative review of the album by Pete Johnson of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who wrote:

<blockquote>"I guess you might call it surrealistic paintings set to music. Not content to record just two sides of musical gibberish, the MOI devote four full sides to their type of 'artistry.' If anyone owns this album, perhaps he can tel me what in hell is going on. [...] The Mothers of Invention, a talented but warped quintet, have fathered an album poetically entitled ''Freak Out'', which could be the greatest stimulus to the aspirin industry since the income tax."<ref>Johnson, Pete.

However, the album gained a cult following in America and was a success in Europe.<ref name="WRVR"/> The album was also an influence on [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt.
