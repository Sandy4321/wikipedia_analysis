"'''Nobody's Fault but Mine'''" is a [[song]] by [[England|English]] [[rock music|rock band]] [[Led Zeppelin]], released in [[1976]] on their album ''[[Presence]]''. 

==Overview==
The track features a phase-treated, [[delta blues]]-based riff in E minor (and later E major) from [[Jimmy Page]] which is complemented by vocalist [[Robert Plant]].  Jimmy Page triple-tracked his guitar intro; playing one guitar an octave higher than the others.

[[Drummer]] [[John Bonham]] and [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] maintain the rhythm of the song, adding some [[Syncopation|syncopated]] accents during repetitions of the introductory phrase. The song also features a [[harmonica]] solo by Plant.

Many of the lyrics in the song such as "Devil he told me to roll" are traditional although [[United States|American]] [[blues]] singer [[Blind Willie Johnson]], recorded it first in December 1927.<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> The 1927 version was about Johnson fretting about physically not being able to read his Bible, being totally blind, and incurring the wrath of God. The song in a sense is apocryphal in that Johnson later died from [[pneumonia]] that set in from sleeping on a wet mattress after the roof burned off of his house.

When the album ''Presence'' was released, the lyrics of "Nobody's Fault but Mine" invited speculation as to what the song was actually about. Some thought it concerned Jimmy Page's [[heroin]] addiction.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

==Live history==
From [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977]] onwards, "Nobody's Fault but Mine" became a vital component of [[Led Zeppelin concerts]], and was played at virtually every show until the group's final [[Tour Over Europe 1980|tour of Europe]] in [[1980]].<ref name=Complete>Dave Lewis (1994), ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin'', Omnibus Press, ISBN 0-7119-3528-9.</ref> One live version, from Led Zeppelin's performance at [[Knebworth Festival 1979|Knebworth in 1979]], is featured on disc 2 of the ''[[Led Zeppelin DVD]]''. During live performances, Plant often exclaimed, "Oh Jimmy!" right before Page went into his guitar solo.

"Nobody's Fault but Mine" was performed at [[Ahmet Erteg<U+00FC>n Tribute Concert|Led Zeppelin's reunion show]] at the [[The O2 arena (London)|O2 Arena]], [[London]] on [[December 10]], [[2007]].

==Other versions==
Robert Plant performed a version of the song during his solo tours in 1988 and 1990.

Jimmy Page performed this song on his tour with [[The Black Crowes]] in 1999.  A version of "Nobody's Fault but Mine" performed by Page and The Black Crowes can be found on the album ''[[Live at the Greek]]''.

[[Page and Plant]] would also record a version in [[1994]], released on their album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]''. This version of the song is performed similarly to acoustic virtuoso [[John Renbourn]]'s version as heard on his 1967 release "Another Monday". Page and Plant played an acoustic version on their subsequent 1995 ''No Quarter'' tour, sometimes swapping it with "[[When the Levee Breaks]]".

A version of the song, with restored lyrics, was recorded by the rock band [[The 77s]] on their album ''[[Drowning With Land In Sight]]''. Their credits indicate "with apologies to Blind Willie Johnson". Led Zeppelin parody cover band [[Dread Zeppelin]] also recorded a version of this song on their album ''[[5,000,000]]''.

A version of this song was played intermittently by [[Jerry Garcia]] with the [[Grateful Dead]] throughout their career, sometimes with lyrics, sometimes without.
