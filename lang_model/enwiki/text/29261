'''''The Last Unicorn''''' is a soundtrack album composed and arranged by [[Jimmy Webb]], released in Germany in 1982 by [[Virgin Records]]. The songs were performed by [[America (band)|America]].<ref name="discogs">{{cite web|title=The Last Unicorn |publisher=''Discogs'' |url=http://www.discogs.com/America-The-Last-Unicorn-Original-Soundtrack/release/894310 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> The popular 1982 animated film was based on the acclaimed children's book ''The Last Unicorn'' by Peter Beagle.<ref name="allmusic"/>

==Production==
''The Last Unicorn'' soundtrack was recorded at De Lane Lea Studios in Wimbley, England in 1982. The album was release in Germany in 1982 by Virgin Records.

==Composition==
The title track plays while the scenes from the [[The Hunt of the Unicorn|Unicorn Tapestries]] form a backdrop for the opening credits, and has been covered by [[Kenny Loggins]] on his ''[[Return to Pooh Corner]]'' album. The film's soundtrack that included the musical score as well as the songs was released in Germany by [[Virgin Records]] in 1982, but it has not been released in the [[United States]]. Mia Farrow's vocals, which appeared in the film, were overdubbed for the soundtrack album by Katie Irving.

==Critical reception==
In his review for ''Allmusic'', James Christopher Monger wrote:
{{quote|The score itself, an appropriately somber and sentimental blend of fairy tale motifs and dark, Wagnerian cues, reflects the story's achingly beautiful tale of a unicorn who attempts to overthrow a maniacal king determined to rid the world of the magical creatures, while the songs are far more creative, daring, and eloquent than all of the cookie-cutter balladry that would eventually replace their type in future animated films. Like ''Watership Down'', ''The Hobbit'', and even Robert Altman's live action, Harry Nilsson-scored ''Popeye'', this hard to find soundtrack is a gem from another age.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Monger |first=James Christopher |title=The Last Unicorn |publisher=''Allmusic'' |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/last-unicorn-mw0000523894 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}</ref>}}
