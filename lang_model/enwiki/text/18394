==Plot==
The story deals with [[Cyrus the Great]] who was called "God's Messiah".  According to <U+02BF>Ezr<U+0101>-n<U+0101>ma, Cyrus was born of Esther and [[Ahaseurus]], King of [[Persia]].  The legend was ceated to possibly answer to important question with regards to Jewish history, the Talmud and the midrashim;  how come a gentile was elected "God's Messiah";why were the Jews freed in [[Babylon]] through [[Cyrus the Great]].  The Book of [[Ester]] retells that Cyrus was seated on the throne of the King [[Solomon]], an honor that had not been granted to the kings of [[Israel]].  Shahin however portrays [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] as [[Esther]]'s son and hence as [[Jew]] through his mother.  In this Jewish Persian epic poem, the birth of Cyrus is depicted as a divine gift.  [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] shows grace, beauty and goodness as a child.  He is presented as a divine figure in parallel with prophets and king of Israel.  In the poem, his sense of truth, justice and bravery are shown to be unrilavled among the kings of the world.  The story then retells the struggle of [[book of Ezra|'Erza]] to rebuild the temple after its destruction of the temple by [[Nebuchadnezzar]].  Erza asks the Jewish people to meet [[Cyrus]] and talk to him about their peoplehood.  Ezra asks [[Cyrus]] to liberate the Jews from torture and let them return to their [[Holy Land]].  The drama of freeing the Jews from Babylonian yoke and restoration of their existence is illustrated vividly in the 'Ezra-nama.  [[Cyrus the Great]] who is depicted as ruling by the will of God is depicted as hero.  After his death, a long eulogy about him brings to end the third of the story.  The poet finishes the poetm by describing the death of [[Esther]] and [[Mordechai]] and their burial in the city of [[Hamadan]].
