'''SMS ''Medusa''''' was the seventh member of the ten-ship {{sclass|Gazelle|cruiser|4}}, built by the [[Imperial German Navy]]. She was built by the [[AG Weser]] dockyard in [[Bremen]], laid down in early 1900, launched in December 1900, and commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] in July 1901. Armed with a main battery of ten {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on}} guns and two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, ''Medusa'' was capable of a top speed of {{convert|21.5|kn|lk=in}}.

''Medusa'' served in all three German navies over the span of over forty years. She served as a fleet scout in the period before [[World War I]], and during the first two years of the conflict, she was used as a coastal defense ship. She was one of six cruisers Germany was allowed to keep by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and she served in the early 1920s in the ''[[Reichsmarine]]''. She was withdrawn from service in 1924 and used in secondary duties, but in 1940, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' converted ''Medusa'' into a floating anti-aircraft battery. She defended the port of [[Wilhelmshaven]] until the closing days of the war, when she was scuttled by her crew. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948&ndash;1950.

''Medusa'' was ordered under the contract name "E" and was laid down at the [[AG Weser]] shipyard in [[Bremen]] in early 1900 and launched on 5 December 1900, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 26 July 1901.<ref name=G992>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 99<U+2013>102</ref> The ship was {{convert|104.8|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|12.2|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|4.84|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|2972|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load.<ref name=G100>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 100</ref> Her propulsion system consisted of two [[triple-expansion engine]]s. They were designed to give {{convert|8000|shp|lk=in}}, for a top speed of {{convert|21.5|kn|lk=in}}. The engines were powered by ten coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Medusa'' carried {{convert|560|t|LT}} of coal, which gave her a range of {{convert|3560|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|10|kn}}. She had a crew of 14 officers and 243 enlisted men.<ref name=G992/>

The ship was armed with ten [[10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/40 guns]] in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to {{convert|12200|m|abbr=on}}. They were supplied with 1,000 rounds of ammunition, for 100 shells per gun. She was also equipped with two {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es. They were submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]].<ref name=G101>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 101</ref> The ship was protected by an armored deck that was {{convert|20|to|25|mm|abbr=on}} thick. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|80|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the guns were protected by {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} thick shields.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 99</ref>

==Service history==
After her commissioning, ''Medusa'' was assigned to the fleet reconnaissance forces.<ref name=G102/> In 1905, she was assigned to the Cruiser Division, alongside her sisters {{SMS|Ariadne||2}} and {{SMS|Amazone||2}} and the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Prinz Heinrich||2}}.<ref>Courtney, p. 22</ref> She served in the fleet scout role up to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, at which point she was employed as a coastal defense vessel. In 1917, she four of her guns removed, and she was used as an [[auxiliary ship]] for the old ironclad {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig Wilhelm||2}},<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, pp. 101&ndash;102</ref> which was being used as a training ship for naval cadets.<ref>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 4</ref> 

''Medusa'' survived the war and was one of six light cruisers Germany was permitted to keep in service by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The ship served in the ''[[Reichsmarine]]'' from 1920 to 1924;<ref name=G102>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 102</ref> in 1922, ''Medusa'' was assigned to the Active Squadron in the Baltic Station, alongside the [[battleship]] {{SMS|Hannover||2}}.<ref>Robinson, p. 1014</ref> In 1924 she was withdrawn from service. On 29 March 1929, she was stricken from the [[naval register]] and thereafter used as a [[barracks ship]] in [[Wilhelmshaven]]. In July 1940, during [[World War II]], ''Medusa'' was converted into a floating anti-aircraft battery in Wilhelmshaven.<ref name=G102/> Her armament at that point consisted of one [[10.5 cm SK C/32 naval gun|10.5 cm SK C/32 gun]], four [[10.5 cm SK C/33 naval gun|10.5 cm SK C/33 guns]], two [[3.7 cm SK C/30|3.7 cm SK C/30 guns]], and four [[2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling|2&nbsp;cm guns]].<ref>Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 222</ref> She was then assigned to Naval Anti-aircraft Group 222, and remained in the harbor at Wilhelmshaven for the duration of the war. Her crews scuttled the ship on 3 May 1945, days before the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]]. The wreck was ultimately salvaged in 1948&ndash;1950 and broken up for scrap.<ref name=G102/>
