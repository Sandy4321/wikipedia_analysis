==Reactions==
At the time of the hijacking, the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Stephen Harper]], was on a state visit to Jamaica. When informed of the hijacking and release of some hostages, he offered the use of his private aircraft to fly the passengers back to [[Canada]]. <ref>Mike Blanchfield, [http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Hostages+held+Canadian+Jamaica/1513311/story.html "Jamaican airline standoff enters eighth hour; crew held hostage"], The Gazette (Montreal) (CanWest News Service), 20 April 2009 7:07am (accessed 7:45am 20 April 2009) </ref>

Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a security analyst for CTV News, and former CSIS officer, expressed concern over airport security in Jamaica, given the state visit by the Canadian Prime Minister at the time of the hijacking. He gave the opinion that security should have been on high alert due to the state visit occurring. <ref name=CTVNewsNetMorning2009-04-20/>

The [[Jamaica Observer]] reports concerns in Jamaica have been raised over the privatized airport security's quality. The security was run by a consortium, MBJ Airports Ltd.,  headed by Canadian firm [[Vancouver Airport Services]] <ref name=JO-2009-4-20-7h00>[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/tools/breakingnews/bnm.asp?bn=966 "Montego Bay Hijacker Surrenders"], [[Jamaica Observer]], 20 April 2009 7:00:40 AM (accessed 20 April 2009 @ 9:30am EDT) </ref> (25% stakeholder) <ref> Toronto Star, [http://www.thestar.com/article/621657 "B.C. firm linked to airport"], '''Bruce Campion-Smith''' & '''Tonda MacCharles''', 21 April 2009 (accessed 25 April 2009) </ref>, and also having [[Abertis]] as a partner.<ref> Toronto Star, [http://www.thestar.com/article/622677 "Workers 'followed procedures' in allowing hijacker on plane"], '''Andrew Chung''', 22 April 2009 (accessed 25 April 2009) </ref>
