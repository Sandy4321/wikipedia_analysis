'''Marek Mal<U+00ED>k''' (born [[June 23]], [[1975]] in [[Ostrava]], [[Czechoslovakia]], now [[Czech Republic]]) is an [[ice hockey]] defenceman, currently playing for the [[New York Rangers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

==Playing career==
Prior to joining the Rangers, Mal<U+00ED>k played for the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. In [[2003-04 NHL Season|2003-04]], while with the Canucks, he shared the [[NHL Plus/Minus Award]] with [[Martin St. Louis]] of the [[Tampa Bay Lightning]]. With the dawn of a new era in the NHL, he has taken his defensive game to [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]], signing a 3-year deal with the Rangers.

Mal<U+00ED>k became a fan-sensation in the NHL after scoring on Washington Capitals netminder [[Olaf K<U+00F6>lzig]] to finish the longest shootout in NHL history, a 15 rounder on [[November 26]], [[2005]]; the goal was described as a "circus shot", as Mal<U+00ED>k drew the puck into the center of the net, put his stick between his legs and shot high on Kolzig's stick side. It has been quite possibly the most memorable shootout moment in the history in the NHL (for example, it was ranked as the best play of the year by [[The Sports Network|TSN]]'s ''[[SportsCentre]]'').
