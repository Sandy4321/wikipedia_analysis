'''Retrocausality''' (also called '''retro-causation''', '''retro-chronal causation''', '''backward causation''', and similar terms) is any of several hypothetical phenomena or processes that reverse [[causality]], allowing an [[result|effect]] to occur before its cause.  

Retrocausality is primarily a [[thought experiment]] in [[philosophy of science]] based on elements of [[physics]], addressing the question: Can the future affect the present, and can the present affect the past?<ref>{{cite journal |last=Barry |first=Patrick |title=What's done is done... or is it? |journal=New Scientist |date=2006-08-28 |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg19125710.900-whats-done-is-done-or-is-it.html |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref> Philosophical considerations of [[time travel]] often address the same issues as retrocausality, as do treatments of the subject in fiction, although the two terms are not universally synonymous.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Faye, Jan |title=Backward Causation |journal=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-backwards/ |date=2001-08-27, rev. 2005-08-29 |accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref>  

A few legitimate physical theories have sometimes been interpreted as leading to retrocausality. This is not considered part of science, since the distinction between cause and effect in physics is not made at the most fundamental level.<ref name="AAASSym">{{cite book |author=Sheehan, D. P., ed. |title=Frontiers of Time: Retrocausation - Experiment and Theory, San Diego, California, 20-22 June 2006.

==As philosophy==
Although philosophical efforts to understand causality extend back at least to [[Aristotle]]'s discussions of the [[Aristotle#Causality.2C_The_Four_Causes|four causes]], the idea that the [[arrow of time]] could be reversed is substantially more recent.  In fact, retrocausality was long considered an inherent self-[[contradiction]] because, as 18th century philosopher [[David Hume]] discussed, when examining two related events, the cause, by definition, is the one that precedes the effect.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hume and the Problem of Causation |author=Beauchamp, Tom L. and Alexander Rosenberg |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0195202366}}</ref>  

Furthermore, the ability to affect the past suggests that causes could be negated by their own effects, creating a [[physical paradox]],<ref>{{cite journal |title=Causality violation and paradoxes |author=Krasnikov, S. V. |journal=Physics Review D |volume=55 |issue=6 |pages=3427<U+2013>3430 |date=March 1997 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.3427}}</ref> such as the well-known [[grandfather paradox]].

In the 1950s, [[Michael Dummett]] wrote in opposition to such definitions, stating that there was no philosophical objection to effects preceding their causes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dummett |first=Michael |title=Can an Effect Precede its Cause |journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |issue=Supp. 28 |year=1954}}</ref>  This argument was rebutted by fellow philosopher [[Antony Flew]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Flew |first=Anthony |title=Can an Effect Precede its Cause |journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society |issue=Supp. 28 |year=1954}}</ref> and, later, by [[Max Black]].  Black's "bilking argument" held that retrocausality is impossible because the observer of an effect could act to prevent its future cause from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Max |title=Why Cannot an Effect Precede Its Cause |url=http://jstor.org/stable/3326929 |journal=Analysis |issue=16 |year=1956 |doi=10.2307/3326929 |volume=16 |pages=49}}</ref>  A more complex discussion of how [[free will]] relates to the issues Black raised is summarized by [[Newcomb's paradox]].  [[Essentialist]] philosophers have proposed other theories, such as proposing the existence of "genuine causal powers in nature"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Philosophy of Nature: A Guide to the New Essentialism |author=Ellis, Brian |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0773524746}}</ref> or by raising concerns about the role of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] in theories of causality.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hume on Causation |author=Beebee, Helen |publisher=Routledge |date=2006-10-25 |isbn=978-0415243391}}</ref>

More recent philosophical inquiries into the topic have often adapted aspects of modern physics, including the hypothetical [[tachyon]] [[particle physics|particle]] and certain [[T-symmetry|time-independent]] aspects of [[quantum mechanics]].  [[Jan Faye]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] has argued that logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction.<ref>{{cite book |author=Faye, Jan, Uwe Scheffler and Max Urchs, eds. |title=Logic and Causal Reasoning |publisher=Wiley-VCH |date=1994-10-13 |isbn=3050025999}}</ref>  Even if such effects are possible, however, they may not be capable of producing effects different from those that would have resulted from normal causal relationships.<ref>{{cite book |author=Elitzur, A., S. Doley and N. Kolenda, eds. |title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics? |publisher=Springer |date=2005-05-25 |isbn=3540221883}}</ref>

[[Jeanne Peijnenburg]] invokes retrocausality to describe how "broad imagination" can redefine or even alter past events, resulting in changes to present-day personality and perception.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Peijnenburg |first=Jeanne |title=Shaping Your Own Life |journal=Metaphilosophy |issue=37}}</ref>  According to [[Cornelis van Putten]], however, there is no need to literally modify the past to achieve the results Peijnenburg discusses.<ref>{{cite journal |last=van Putten |first=Cornelis |title=Changing the Past: Retrocausality and Narrative Construction |journal=Metaphilosophy |issue=37}}</ref>

==As physics==
Established physics does not generally employ retrocausality.  Nevertheless, a number of theories allowing particles or information to travel backward in time have been proposed by prominent scientists or have received meaningful evaluation by the scientific community. <!-- No citation needed: This is a summary of the subsections. -->

=== Antimatter ===
[[Image:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|300px|thumb|right|Time runs left to right in this Feynman diagram of [[electron]]-[[positron]] [[annihilation]].  When interpreted to include retrocausality, the electron (marked e<sup>-</sup>) was not destroyed, instead becoming the positron (e<sup>+</sup>) and moving backward in time.]] 

As the modern understanding of particle physics began to develop, retrocausality was at times employed as a tool to model then-unfamiliar or unusual conditions, including [[electromagnetism]] and [[antimatter]].  

The [[Wheeler<U+2013>Feynman absorber theory]], proposed by [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Richard Feynman]], uses retrocausality and a temporal form of [[destructive interference]] to explain the absence of a type of converging concentric [[wave]] suggested by certain solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wheeler, John and Richard Feynman |title=Interaction with the Absorber as the Mechanism of Radiation |journal=Review of Modern Physics |issue=17 |year=1945}}</ref>  These advanced waves don't have anything to do with cause and effect, they are just a different mathematical way to describe normal waves. The reason they were proposed is so that a charged particle would not have to act on itself, which, in normal classical electromagnetism leads to an infinite self-force.<ref name="Price">{{cite book |last=Price |first=Huw |title=Time's Arrow and Archimedes' Point |date=1997-12-04 |isbn=0195117980 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York}}</ref>  

Feynman, and earlier Stueckelberg, proposed an interpretation of the [[positron]] as an electron moving backward in time<ref>{{cite journal |last=Feynman |first=Richard |title=The Theory of Positrons |journal=Physical Review |issue=76 |year=1949 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.749 |volume=76 |pages=749}}</ref>, reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the [[Dirac equation]]. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive [[electric charge]].  Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that "they are all the same electron" with a complex, self-intersecting [[worldline]].<ref>{{cite speech |title=The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=1965-12-11 |location=Nobel Lecture |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/feynman-lecture.html |accessdate=2007-01-02}}</ref>  [[Yoichiro Nambu]] later applied it to all production and [[annihilation]] of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that "the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from past to future, or from future to past."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Nambu |first=Yoichiro |title=The Use of the Proper Time in Quantum Electrodynamics I |journal=Progress in Theoretical Physics |issue=5 |year=1950}}</ref>  The backwards in time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures, but it doesn't have anything to do with the macroscopic terms "cause" and "effect", which do not appear in a microscopic physical description.

===Current topics===
Open topics in physics, especially involving the reconciliation of [[gravity]] with quantum physics, suggest that retrocausality may be possible under certain circumstances.

[[Closed timelike curve]]s, in which the [[world line]] of an object returns to its origin, arise from some [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] to the [[Einstein field equation]].  Although closed timelike curves do not appear to exist under normal conditions, extreme environments of [[spacetime]], such as a [[Wormhole#Traversable_wormholes|traversable wormhole]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Thorne |first=Kip |title=Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy |publisher=W W Norton |year=1994 |isbn=0-393-31276-3}}</ref> or the region near certain [[cosmic strings]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Gott |first=John Richard |title=Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2002 |isbn=0-618-25735-7}}</ref> may allow their formation, implying a theoretical possibility of retrocausality.  The [[exotic matter]] or [[topological defect]]s required for the creation of those environments have not been observed.  Furthermore, [[Stephen Hawking]] has suggested a mechanism he describes as the [[chronology protection conjecture]], which would destroy any such closed timelike curve before it could be used.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hawking |first=Stephen |title=The Chronology Protection Conjecture |journal=Physical Review D |issue=46 |year=1992 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.603 |volume=46 |pages=603}}</ref>  These objections to the existence of closed timelike curves are not universally accepted, however.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Li |first=Li-Xin |title=Must Time Machine Be Unstable against Vacuum Fluctuations? |journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity |issue=13 |year=1996}}</ref>

Retrocausality has also been proposed as a mechanism to explain what [[Albert Einstein]] called "spooky action at a distance" occurring as a result of [[quantum entanglement]].  Although the prevailing scientific viewpoint is that the effects generated by quantum entanglement do not require any direct communication between the involved particles, [[Costa de Beauregard]] proposed an alternative theory.<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Beauregard |first=Costa |title=Time Symmetry and the Einstein Paradox |journal=Il Nuovo Cimento |issue=42B |year=1977}}</ref> 

At an [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] symposium, [[University of Washington]] physicist [[John G. Cramer|John Cramer]] presented the design for an experiment to test for backward causation in quantum entanglement,<ref name="AAASSym" /> subsequently receiving some attention from the popular media.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Paulson |first=Tom |title=Going for a blast in the real past |journal=Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=2006-11-15 |url=http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/292378_timeguy15.html?source=mypi |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |title=Time-travel physics seems stranger than fiction |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-11-21 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15817394/ |accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref>  Work on Cramer's non-local communication test started in January 2007.  Cramer included a status report on the "UW Test of Nonlocal Quantum Communications with Momentum-Entangled Photon Pairs" in his "Five Decades of Physics" talk at a  symposium in his honor at the University of Washington, Seattle, Washington,  September 11 2009.  Work on the experiment will continue during 2010.<ref>Cramer, John G. "Faster-than-Light Implications of Quantum Entanglement and Nonlocality."  Marc G. Millis (Editor), Eric W. Davis (Editor).

Retrocausality has also been proposed as an explanation<ref>{{cite paper |title=Backward Causation and the EPR Paradox |author=Wharton, William R. |date=1998-10-28 |url=http://arxiv.org/html/quant-ph/9810060 |accessdate=2007-06-21}}</ref> for the [[delayed choice quantum eraser]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Complementarity and the Quantum Eraser |author=Herzog, T.

The hypothetical [[faster-than-light|superluminal]] particle called the tachyon, proposed in the context of the [[Bosonic string theory]] and certain other fields of high-energy physics, moves backward in time.  Despite frequent depiction in [[science fiction]] as a method to send messages back in time, theories predicting tachyons do not permit them to interact with normal "[[Minkowski space|time-like]]" matter in a manner that would violate standard causality.  Specifically, the [[Feinberg reinterpretation principle]] renders impossible construction of a tachyon detector capable of receiving information.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Feinberg |first=Gerald |title=Possibility of Faster-Than-Light Particles |journal=Physical Review |issue=159 |year=1967 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.159.1089 |volume=159 |pages=1089}}</ref>

==As para-science==
Outside the mainstream scientific community, retrocausality has also been proposed as a mechanism to explain purported anomalies, [[paranormal]] events or personal events, but mainstream scientists generally regarded these explanations as [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]]. Most notably, [[Parapsychology|parapsychologist]] [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] presented quantum mechanical justifications for retrocausality,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=Helmut |title=Can an effect precede its cause? A model of a noncausal world |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=8 |date=June 1978}}</ref> eventually claiming that experiments had demonstrated the ability to manipulate [[radioactive decay]] through retrocausal [[psychokinesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schmidt |first=Helmut |title=Collapse of the state vector and psychokinetic effect |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=12 |date=June 1982}}</ref> These results and their underlying theory have been rejected by the mainstream scientific community,<ref>{{cite book |author=Druckman, Daniel and John A.
