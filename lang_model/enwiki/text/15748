The plot focuses around Homer's depression about aging and no longer being cool, and his quest to become cool again by joining the "Hullabalooza" music festival as a carnival freak. The episode title is a play on the [[Lollapalooza]] music festival.

[[Peter Frampton]] and musical groups [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Sonic Youth]] guest star as themselves.<ref name=officialsite/>

==Plot==
After the school bus is destroyed at the auto wrecking yard, Homer is forced to drive his (and other) kids to school. Along the way, he listens to a [[classic rock]] [[radio station]] that plays [[Grand Funk Railroad]] and is shocked to discover that all of the kids hate it, and have never heard of them. After several more days of the kids hating his music (which Bart calls "dinosaur bands"), Homer visits a music store and realizes that what he likes is no longer considered cool. As a result, Homer decides to take Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. At the festival, Homer tries to act cool by wearing a [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] hat, but all he does is humiliate himself and is confronted by an angry crowd of [[Generation X]]ers who mistake him for a [[Narc (narcotics)|narc]]. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of [[Peter Frampton]]'s [[Pink Floyd pigs|inflatable pig]]s (purchased at "[[Pink Floyd]]'s yard sale") at his stomach. The festival head is impressed and Homer is hired as a part of the festival's [[freak show]].

As a result, Homer gets to go on tour with the festival and hangs out with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Sonic Youth]]. Homer suddenly finds himself living the high life: partying with big name rock stars and becoming respected among American youth, including Bart. As the tour approaches a stop in Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to hurt and he is sent to a veterinarian. The veterinarian advises Homer that if he performs his act one more time, his stomach will burst and he will die. Homer shrugs this news off, not wanting to lose his popularity. At first he decides to do his job, but at the last second he loses his nerve and dodges the cannonball. He is released from the festival and goes back to not being respected by his children.<ref name=officialsite/><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1|page=206}}</ref><ref name="Simpsguide">{{cite book|last=Martyn |first=Warren|coauthors=Adrian Wood|title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0495-2|pages=}}</ref>

==Production==
The entire story of this episode is the brainchild of [[David X. Cohen|David Cohen]], although it was written by [[Brent Forrester]], who felt that Cohen at least deserved a "story by" credit.<ref name="Forrester"/> To do research for this episode, Forrester went to one of the Lollapalooza concerts, which he thought would be a fun little perk, but ended up being a horrible experience. Several of the jokes in this episode are based on his experiences: cameras (including his own) were being seized and thrown in the garbage, there were numerous advertisements, several "sour faced teens", a real freak show and at one point a stranger approached Forrester and asked "how's it going, [[Narc (narcotics)|nark]]?"<ref name="Forrester">{{cite video | people=Forrester, Brent|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Homerpalooza"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

During Homer's confrontation with the Hullabalooza crowd, there is a brief shot of Homer with the members of the musical group [[No Doubt]] behind him. [[Gwen Stefani]]'s brother [[Eric Stefani]], who himself had been a member of the band, was working as an animator at ''The Simpsons'' at the time and added them in.<ref name="Archer">{{cite video | people=Archer, Wes|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Homerpalooza"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Casting===
The writers were aiming to have artists that represented several genres: [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] (Cypress Hill), [[alternative rock]] (Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins) and a classic rock singer. Originally, [[Bob Dylan]] was sought for this role, but he was replaced by Peter Frampton.<ref name="Weinstein"/> [[Neil Young]] and [[Pearl Jam]]<ref name="EW">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292523,00.html HOMERIC VERSE] ''EW.com''. Published May 10, 1996, Retrieved on February 8, 2007</ref> were also sought for the episode but turned down the offer.

Originally, [[Courtney Love]] and [[Hole (band)|Hole]] were wanted for this episode, but they declined.<ref name="Keeler">{{cite video | people=Keeler, Ken|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Homerpalooza"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> According to the DVD commentary an unnamed group had said that if Courtney Love was in the episode, they would not be. An [[Entertainment Weekly]] article revealed that the group was Sonic Youth.<ref name="EW"/>  It was thought that Love would appear in the episode because she had recently done a movie with [[James L. Brooks]], but she never responded to the request. Love was wanted specifically for one joke which would be in an exchange between her and Homer:<br />
'''Courtney Love''': ''Hi Homer! I'm a big fan, Courtney Love.<br />
'''Homer''': ''Homer Grateful!''<ref name="Keeler"/><br />
However, she did not appear and the joke was reworded for [[Billy Corgan]] of the Smashing Pumpkins:<br />
'''Billy Corgan''': ''Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins.<br />
'''Homer''': ''Homer Simpson, smiling politely.''
