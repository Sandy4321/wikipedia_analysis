[[File:Robert Parsons (1546-1610).jpg|thumb|Robert Persons, S.J.]]

'''Robert Persons''' (24 June 1546&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;15 April 1610), later known as '''Robert Parsons''', was an English [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest.

He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century "English Mission" of the Society of Jesus.

==Early life==
Born at [[Nether Stowey]], [[Somerset]] to [[yeoman]] parents, by favour of the local parson John Hayward, Persons was sent in 1562 to [[St. Mary's Hall, Oxford]]. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] in 1568.

==College fellow and priest==
A Fellow of Balliol, Persons clashed with the Master, [[Adam Squire]], as well as the academic and Roman Catholic priest [[Christopher Bagshaw]].<ref name="DNB">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Parsons, Robert (1546-1610)|volume=43}}</ref> On 13 February 1574, he was forced to resign. Reconciled overseas through discussion and pupillage with [[William Good (Jesuit)|Father William Good, SJ]], he became a Jesuit at St Paul's, Rome on 3 July 1575.

==English mission: 1580<U+2013>1581==
Persons accompanied [[Edmund Campion]] on his mission to English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, [[Everard Mercurian]], had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English affairs. He was persuaded by Italian Jesuit provincial, and later Superior General [[Claudio Acquaviva]], after [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] had found Mercurian resistant in October 1579.<ref name="ODNB"/> Persons tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English [[secular clergy]]. He was impatient with Father Good's approach. Campion was much less of an enthusiast.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M. McCoog|author2=Campion Hall (University of Oxford)|title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits : Essays in Celebration of the First Centenary of Campion Hall, Oxford (1896-1996)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&pg=PA124|accessdate=25 May 2012|year=1996|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85115-590-6|page=124 note 22}}</ref>

The mission was immediately compromised as [[Pope Gregory XIII|the pope]] had sent a separate group to the Jesuit mission, to support the Irish rebel, [[James FitzMaurice FitzGerald]]. Persons and Campion only learned of this in [[Reims]] while en route to England. After the invasion force under the mercenary [[Thomas Stukley]] had achieved nothing in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor [[recusancy|recusants]] closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

In June 1580 [[Thomas Pounde]], then in the [[Marshalsea Prison]], went to speak to Persons. There resulted a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and [[Henry Tripp]], who used to preach to the [[Marshalsea]] inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was transferred to [[Bishop's Stortford Castle]]; but the prepared statement of Campion was later circulated after his capture.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=69038|title=Pounde, Thomas|first=Thomas M.|last=McCoog}}</ref>

Much of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He did make his negative view on church papism {{Clarify|date=April 2014}} clear to local Catholic clergy, at a synod in [[Southwark]]. The secret press needed to be relocated, moving in early 1581 to [[Stonor Park]]. Campion was captured in July; and then [[Stephen Brinkley]], who ran the press, was taken in August. Quite soon after that Persons left for France.<ref name="ODNB"/> The underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with criticism from the Catholic side. They persisted with it for another two years, but Jesuit opinion came down against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the [[Tower of London]], but under adverse conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

==To the Armada==
Persons spent the winter of 1581<U+2013>82 at [[Rouen]], and embarked on writing projects. He was in close contact with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]], on the coast to the north-east. [[William Creighton (Jesuit)|Father William Creighton, SJ]] was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from [[Esm<U+00E9> Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]]; and they went to Paris to confer with William Allen, [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|James Beaton]] and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the [[raid of Ruthven]] of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.<ref name="DNB"/>

A new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to [[Flanders]], and stayed for some time at the court of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]. The discovery of the [[Throckmorton Plot]] disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. [[Philip II of Spain]] took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.<ref name="DNB"/>

It was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]''. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author.<ref name="ODNB"/> The British historian John Bossy, from the University of York, is inclined to disagree.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M. McCoog|author2=Campion Hall (University of Oxford)|title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits : Essays in Celebration of the First Centenary of Campion Hall, Oxford (1896-1996)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&pg=PA146|accessdate=25 May 2012|year=1996|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85115-590-6|page=146}}</ref>

There is a scholarly consensus that the intention was to affect French domestic politics, strengthening the Guise faction against Anglophiles. Correspondingly his own standing suffered in some quarters.<ref name="ODNB"/> Claudio Acquaviva by the end of the year was concerned that the Jesuit strategies for France and the English mission would turn out to be inconsistent in the longer term, and consulted Pope Gregory XIII on the matter. Persons as his subordinate had been told to drop plans to assassinate Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M. McCoog|author2=Campion Hall (University of Oxford)|title=The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits : Essays in Celebration of the First Centenary of Campion Hall, Oxford (1896-1996)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f01RY4H7MfoC&pg=PA155|accessdate=25 May 2012|year=1996|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-0-85115-590-6|pages=155<U+2013>7}}</ref>

In September 1585, [[Pope Sixtus V]] succeeded Pope Gregory XIII, and Persons and Allen went to Rome; Persons was still there when the [[Spanish Armada]] sailed in 1588. At this period Allen and Persons made a close study of the [[succession to Elizabeth I of England]], working with noted genealogist Robert Heighinton.<ref name="DNB"/> Persons was professed in Rome on 7 May 1587.

==Later life==
Persons was sent to Spain at the close of 1588, to conciliate [[Philip II of Spain]], who was offended with [[Claudio Acquaviva]]. Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of [[English College, Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[English College of St Gregory|Seville]], and [[Madrid]] (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of [[San-Lucar]] and of [[Lisbon]] (which became a college in 1622). He now succeeded in establishing at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of [[Stonyhurst College]] <ref>{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Robert Persons}}</ref>

In 1596, in [[Seville]], he wrote ''Memorial for the Reformation of England'', which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith. He had hoped to succeed [[William Allen (cardinal)|Allen]] as Cardinal on the latter's death. Unsuccessful, he was rewarded with the rectorship of the [[English College at Rome|English College]] in Rome, where he died at the age of 63.
