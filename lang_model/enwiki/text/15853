'''''Beck v. Eiland-Hall''''' is a case filed before the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in 2009 by [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]] [[Glenn Beck]], concerning the [[satire|satirical]] website "GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com". The site was created by Isaac Eiland-Hall as a [[parody]] of Beck's style of commentary. The site name came from Internet discussions which were based on a joke originally used by comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]] at a 2008 [[Roast (comedy)|comedy roast]] of [[Bob Saget]], where Gottfried jokingly implored listeners to disregard the (non-existent) rumor that his fellow comedian raped and murdered a girl in 1990. Internet posters contrasted the meme with Beck's style of arguing, by requesting Beck "prove that he didn't" commit the act in question. Eiland-Hall created a website about it, which launched on September 1, 2009, and had 120,000 page loads within its first 24 hours.

Attorneys representing Glenn Beck's media company Mercury Radio Arts requested the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website to delete the site. They filed a complaint to the WIPO under the [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) asserting that the domain name of the website was itself [[defamation|defamatory]] and claimed trademark over the domain name for its use of "Glenn Beck".  [[Marc Randazza]] represented Eiland-Hall and filed a response brief to WIPO comparing the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Hustler Magazine v. Falwell]]'', and asserted that the website's domain name was "protected political speech", and "satirical political humor". The brief explained the connection between the website and their view on Beck's style of interviewing, where he asks his guests to prove a negative. Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he prefers [[United States law]] over [[international law]].

Randazza sent a letter to Beck's attorneys, requesting that Beck stipulate to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] during the WIPO case. Beck filed a supplemental filing in the case, and argued that the domain name was misleading and could lead individuals to believe it contained factual information rather than criticism. Eiland-Hall filed a surreply which said that Beck "attempted to silence a critic by circumventing (and thereby devaluing) the First Amendment". On October 29, 2009, the WIPO ruled against Beck, concluding that Eiland-Hall was making a political statement through use of parody in a "legitimate non-commercial use" of the Glenn Beck mark. Eiland-Hall wrote a letter to Beck in which he voluntarily turned over ownership of the domain name. He kept the website active at GB1990.com and didglennbeckrapeandmurderayounggirlin1990.com.

Commentators analyzed Beck's actions with respect to the "[[Streisand effect]]", and noted that Beck's actions with regard to the website have served to increase attention to the site itself. Representatives of [[Public Citizen]], the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], and the [[Citizen Media Law Project]] agreed that Beck's trademark claim in his complaint over the website was "preposterous". A journalist for ''[[The First Post]]'' observed that Beck's claim that a website's domain name was itself defamatory "looks like a first in cyber law". After the WIPO ruling, ''Online Media Daily'' noted that a ruling in Beck's favor may have encouraged other U.S. subjects of satirical websites to circumvent the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] by taking claims to WIPO rather than airing them in U.S. courts. The assistant director of the Citizen Media Law Project commented on the conclusion of the case, "It's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution."

===Litigation===
====Beck initiates legal action====
By September 3, 2009, attorneys representing Mercury Radio Arts, Glenn Beck's media company, had requested the domain registrar of Eiland-Hall's website to delete the site.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-30" /><ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> Beck's lawyers called the site's location a "highly defamatory domain name".<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> They demanded that the domain registrar revoke the WhoisGuard privacy protection service of the website, and turn over the the contact information of the then-anonymous Eiland-Hall.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> The registrar, NameCheap, refused.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> On September 4, 2009, Beck's lawyers sent another letter to the domain registrar, repeating their requests, and noting that they had read the website's contents: "We also note that it appears you contacted the individual, as he states on his website hosted on the Defamatory Domain that 'my webhost is taking some flak over this website, so if he gets shuts me down, it may take a bit to get rehosted.'"<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/>

The second letter to NameCheap stated: "Despite our letter yesterday demanding that you delete the Defamatory Domain, suspend and/or terminate your provision of WhoisGuard privacy protection services to the unknown individual who sought to register the domain, and provide us with information identifying the unknown individual, we note that as of Friday, September 4, 2009 at approximately 6:35 EDT, the Defamatory Domain remains active."<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04" /> The domain registrar changed the nameservers of the website without telling Eiland-Hall.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> After Eiland-Hall contacted the registrar, he was permitted to move the nameservers back.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> Eiland-Hall subsequently registered alternate domains, including "DidGlennBeckRapeAndMurderAYoungGirlIn1990.com", and "gb1990.com".<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/><ref name="stone">{{Cite news   | last = Stone  | first = Michael | title = Glenn Beck 1990: Politics of retribution  | newspaper = Portland  Progressive Examiner  | publisher = www.examiner.com  | date = September 8, 2009  | url = http://www.examiner.com/x-4383-Portland-Progressive-Examiner~y2009m9d8-Glenn-Beck-1990-Politics-of-retribution  | accessdate =2009-10-21 }}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[Gawker]]'' on September 9, 2009, Eiland-Hall stated that Beck's attorneys "have gone after the domain registrar, the hosting service, and even the data center that houses the servers on which his site lives".<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04" /> "They basically tried to contact every level to shut it down. My hosting service isn't happy with the situation, but they're standing by me until they get a court order," said Eiland-Hall.<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04" /> He told ''Gawker'' that he wanted his identity to remain anonymous.<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04" /> ''Gawker'' reported that they attempted to obtain a statement from Beck: "We contacted Beck's personal publicist, who declined to comment but confirmed that Beck believes the site to be defamatory and is trying to get it taken down."<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04" />

====WIPO complaint====
In September 2009, lawyers representing Beck and his media company Mercury Radio Arts filed a complaint to the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) under the [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] (UDRP), against the privacy service for Eiland-Hall's website.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /><ref name="Boston Herald 2009-10-02" /><ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30"/> WIPO is a [[Switzerland]]-based agency of the [[United Nations]].<ref name="emerson">{{cite news   | last =Emerson  | first =Jim  | title =All Your Beck Are Belong To Us  | work =Scanners  | publisher =[[Chicago Sun-Times]]  | date =October 2, 2009  | url =http://blogs.suntimes.com/scanners/2009/10/all_your_beck_are_belong_to_us.html  | accessdate = 2009-10-16 }}</ref><ref name="Boston Herald 2009-10-02" /> The rules of WIPO's Arbitration and Mediation Center were created by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN).<ref name="schmidt">{{cite web  | last =Schmidt  | first =Steffen    | title =Media Meme's and Glenn Beck&nbsp;<U+2013> Truth or Lies?  | work =[[Des Moines Register]]  | publisher =The Des Moines Register  | date =October 5, 2009  | url =http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2009/10/05/media-memes-and-glenn-beck-truth-or-lies/  | accessdate =2009-10-06  }}</ref> The privacy service for the website revealed the identity of the site's owner in response to Beck's complaint.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" />

Beck's complaint asserted that Eiland-Hall "is attempting to mislead the public regarding the nature, origin and affiliation of the Web site".<ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30"/> Beck argued that the domain name of the website could be confused with his [[trademark]], "Glenn Beck".<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> The complaint described the website's domain name as "[[defamation|defamatory]]" and asserted it "infringes on Beck's trademark interest in his own name".<ref name="Gawker 2009-10-04">{{cite news| first=John | last=Cook |url=http://gawker.com/5355901/glenn-beck-pr-genius-spreads-the-false-rumor-he-raped-and-murdered-a-young-girl-in-1990|title=Glenn Beck, PR Genius, Spreads the False Rumor He Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990| work=[[Gawker]]|publisher=Gawker Media|date=September 9, 2009|accessdate = 2009-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-11">{{cite news| author=Citizen Media Law Project staff |url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/blog/2009/will-glenn-beck-sue-defamatory-website-2009|title=Will Glenn Beck Sue a Defamatory Website in 2009?| publisher=www.citmedialaw.org|work=[[Citizen Media Law Project]]|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate = 2009-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Adweek 2009-09-29">{{cite news|first=Eriq|last=Gardner|url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3i49ed8b00bbe771aa3d0035e57251257f|title=Glenn Beck Satire Site Fights Back| work=[[Adweek]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=September 29, 2009|accessdate = 2009-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> Beck did not claim libel or defamation as point in the complaint itself, which instead focused on the legal issue of trademark.<ref name="hamilton0910">{{Cite news   | last = Hamilton  | first = David  | title = TV Host Glenn Beck to Take Legal Action Against Nasty Domain  | newspaper = Web Host Industry Review  | publisher = www.thewhir.com  | date = September 9, 2009  | url = http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/091009_TV_Host_Glenn_Beck_to_Take_Legal_Action_Against_Libelous_Domain  | accessdate =2009-10-21 }}</ref><ref name="stone" /> The complaint asserted that the website was "plainly libelous, patently false, not authorized by Mercury or Beck, and is likely to cause confusion for consumers".<ref name="schmelzer" />

Beck's complaint asserted that the very nature of the domain name of the website itself was an example of a bad faith registration.<ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30" /> The complaint argued that Eiland-Hall could have no legitimate interests or rights to the website's domain name.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> As of September 2009, Beck was still in the process of trademarking use of his name for "goods and services", including usage of the name "Glenn Beck" on merchandise.<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-09"/> Eiland-Hall told ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', "I was a little surprised that Beck, of all people<U+2014>after making such a big deal about how international bodies should never be able to trump the U.S. Constitution<U+2014>would take this to an international organization. But as I felt confident I would win, I wasn't too worried about it."<ref name="sarlin" />

====Eiland-Hall response====
[[File:Eiland-Hall Response Brief.pdf|thumb|Brief filed by respondent (September 28, 2009)]]
Eiland-Hall retained [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment rights]] lawyer [[Marc Randazza]] to represent him.<ref name="Boston Herald 2009-10-02" /> According to Randazza, Eiland-Hall sought out legal representation after receiving "threatening letters" from lawyers representing Beck.<ref name="Boston Herald 2009-10-02" /> On September 28, 2009, Randazza filed a 17-page response brief on behalf of his client.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /><ref name="schmidt" /> The response brief asserted the website's domain name is "protected political speech",<ref name="Boston Herald 2009-10-02" /> and "satirical political humor".<ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30" /> According to Randazza, the website was being used for satire purposes, and the website's owner was not attempting to make a profit from such satire.<ref name="schmelzer" />

Randazza wrote: "Only an abject imbecile could believe that the domain name would have any connection to [Beck]".<ref name="National Public Radio 2009-10-04">{{cite news| first=Andy | last=Carvin|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2009/10/when_internet_memes_go_to_cour.html|title=Glenn Beck Internet Meme Gets Ugly| work=[[National Public Radio]]|publisher=www.npr.org|date=October 2, 2009|accessdate = 2009-10-04}}</ref><ref name="Domain Name Wire 2009-10-01">{{cite news| first=Andrew | last=Allemann |url=http://domainnamewire.com/2009/10/01/hot-off-press-domain-owner-responds-to-glenn-beck/|title=Hot off Press: Domain Owner Responds to Glenn Beck |work=Domain Name Wire|publisher=domainnamewire.com|date=October 1, 2009|accessdate = 2009-10-04}}</ref> Randazza wrote that the website's domain name could not be confused with the "Glenn Beck" trademark, except to "[[A moron in a hurry]]".<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> This phrase refers to a legal concept where a reasonable person could become confused or deceived.<ref>{{cite book| last = MacQueen | first =Hector L. | coauthors = Charlotte Waelde, Graeme T.

He wrote: "We are not here because the domain name could cause confusion. We do not have a declaration from the president of the international association of imbeciles that his members are blankly staring at the Respondent's website wondering 'where did all the race baiting content go?'"<ref name="National Public Radio 2009-10-04" /><ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-30" /> Randazza further explained the "moron in a hurry" argument, with respect to this case: "It is specious at best for Mr. Beck to assert that his fans, or the public as a whole, would confuse Respondent<U+2019>s website with Mr. Beck himself<U+2014>unless of course it is Mr. Beck<U+2019>s view that his fans and the average internet user are in fact hurried morons."<ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-30" />

{{Wikinews|US free speech lawyer Marc Randazza discusses Glenn Beck parody}}
Randazza asserted that Beck had not sufficiently showed he has trademark rights over his name, "Glenn Beck".<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> The response asserted that Beck was actually trying to have the website taken down because he did not appreciate the criticism.<ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30" /> "We are here because Mr. Beck wants respondent's Web site shut down. He wants it shut down because Respondent's website makes a poignant and accurate satirical critique of Mr. Beck by parodying Beck's very rhetorical style," wrote Randazza in the response brief.<ref name="MediaPost 2009-09-30" /><ref name="Ars Technica 2009-09-30" /> Randazza argued that Eiland-Hall does have legitimate rights to his website's domain name because of its use as criticism of Beck and as part of the Internet meme that had started on the Fark website.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> "The Web site is a legitimate criticism site, consists of political satire, and thus the Respondent has legitimate rights in the domain name. Mr. Beck's attempt to censor this criticism is improper and should be rejected," wrote Randazza in the brief.<ref name="Adweek 2009-09-29" />

The brief gave a brief history of [[Internet phenomena]], including video parodies of the [[German film]] ''[[Downfall (film)|Downfall]]'', memes based on the film ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', "Hitler Hates Kanye West", "[[All your base are belong to us]]", "[[ate my balls|Mr. Spock Ate My Balls]]", and the "Gerbil story" involving [[Richard Gere]].<ref name="emerson" /><ref name="gloucesterlawyer">{{cite web  | last =Sawyer  | first =Rick  | title =Gloucester Lawyer Defends Satirical Glenn Beck Website  | work =[[Bostonist]]  | publisher =[[Gothamist]]  | date =September 30, 2009  | url =http://bostonist.com/2009/09/30/satirical_glenn_beck_website_based.php  | accessdate = 2009-10-06 }}</ref><ref name="National Public Radio 2009-10-04" /><ref name="Adweek 2009-09-29" /><ref name="schmelzer" /> Randazza traced the website's origin, explaining the internet meme's roots in the Gilbert Gottfried joke: "The meme is a parody of from {{sic}} Glenn Beck<U+2019>s own argumentation style mated with a  Gilbert Gottfried routine performed during the Comedy Central Roast of  <U+201C>comedian<U+201D> Bob Saget.  During Gottfried<U+2019>s speech, he kept repeating (in his trademark nasally voice) that there were rumors that Bob Saget had raped and killed a girl in 1990...".<ref name="schmelzer" /> Randazza then spelled out the "humor equation" of Eiland-Hall's website: "The humor equation is simple: (Outrageous Accusation) + (Celebrity) + (Question Why the Celebrity Does Not Deny the Accusation) = (Confirmation of the Falsity of the Accusation + Laughter)".<ref name="schmelzer" /><ref name="emerson" />

Randazza's argument compared the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] case ''[[Hustler Magazine v.

Beck is represented by a learned and respected legal team.

See, e.g., ''Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell'', 485 U.S. 46 (1988).  Accordingly, Beck is attempting to use this transnational body to circumvent and subvert the Respondent<U+2019>s constitutional rights."<ref name="schmelzer" /> In the legal brief, Randazza pointed out that Beck's action of going to the WIPO in an attempt to get the website taken down was in contradiction to his prior statements saying he prefers [[United States law]] over [[international law]].<ref name="Domain Name Wire 2009-10-01" /> "[Beck<U+2019>s] got good lawyers.

On September 29, 2009, Randazza requested that Beck voluntarily ask that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] be applied to the arbitration case, despite its international setting.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /><ref name="brilliant" /><ref name="todayinrandazza" /> Randazza made this request because Beck's political commentary favored the [[United States Constitution]] over [[international law]].<ref name="brilliant">{{cite web  | last =Brayton  | first =Ed  | title =Brilliant Response to Beck Case  | work =[[ScienceBlogs]]  | publisher =Seed Media Group  | date =October 6, 2009  | url =http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/10/brilliant_response_to_beck_cas.php  | accessdate =  2009-10-06}}</ref> Randazza's September 29, 2009 letter to Beck's attorneys cited statements by Beck himself, where Beck indicated he preferred United States law over international law.<ref name="brilliant" /> These quotes by Beck included the statement: "Once we sign our rights over to international law, the Constitution is officially dead."<ref name="brilliant" /> Randazza's letter concluded: "I hate to presume anything about anyone, but I presume that Mr. Beck will agree to this stipulation.

But a public figure, somebody who has purposely seized the limelight and who has access to the media, has to show something called actual malice. And that means you have to show that it was knowingly false or that it was a reckless disregard for the truth. Now, that might even seem to fit here, however, the Supreme Court has ruled that when in the context it is not really a serious statement of fact, actual malice cannot be proven."<ref name="wprr" /> He cited as an example the ''Hustler Magazine v. Falwell'' case that was popularized in the film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''.<ref name="wprr" />

====Supplemental filing and surreply====
;Beck supplemental filing
Beck submitted a supplemental filing in the case on October 13, 2009.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> In Beck's supplemental filing, his attorneys asserted that the joke of the Eiland-Hall website is not obvious, and therefore the website's domain name is misleading.<ref name="hamilton1021">{{Cite news   | last = Hamilton  | first = David  | title = Glenn Beck Accuses Nasty Domain Of Misleading Visitors  | newspaper = Web Host Industry Review  | publisher = www.thewhir.com  | date = October 21, 2009  | url = http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/102109_Glenn_Beck_Accuses_Nasty_Domain_Of_Misleading_Visitors  | accessdate = 2009-10-21}}</ref> "While there is absolutely nothing humorous or amusing about the statement made by Respondent in his domain name that 'Glenn Beck Raped and Murdered a Young Girl in 1990,' the average Internet user finding the domain name GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlin1990.com ("Disputed Domain Name") in a search would have no reason not to believe that they will be directed to a website providing factual information (as opposed to protected criticism or similar protected speech) about Mr. Beck," wrote Beck's attorneys in the supplemental filing.<ref name="hamilton1021" />

;Eiland-Hall surreply
[[File:Eiland-Hall Respondent's Surreply.pdf|thumb|Respondent's surreply (October 20, 2009)]]
On October 20, 2009, Eiland-Hall filed a surreply in response to Beck's supplemental filing.<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-28" /> Eiland-Hall's attorney Randazza wrote in the surreply, "An average Internet user might not 'get the joke. In fact, the average Internet user does not understand any internet memes. That<U+2019>s the fun of a meme&nbsp;<U+2014> it is an esoteric inside joke that will leave most people scratching their heads."<ref name="hamilton1021" /> In Randazza's conclusion to the Eiland-Hall surreply, he noted, "Glenn Beck is the butt of a viral joke. He may not get the joke, but this does not make the joke likely to confuse or subject the domain name to transfer under the UDRP. Glenn Beck's failure to understand these basic principles of law does not make the joke any less humorous, and does not make him any less of the butt. The First Amendment protects Respondent<U+2019>s right to make Glenn Beck the butt, and his hypocritical attempts to squelch legitimate free speech criticism do nothing to portray himself in a more flattering light. Because his arguments do not satisfy Section 4(a) of the Policy, his request should be denied. Because he has attempted to silence a critic by circumventing (and thereby devaluing) the First Amendment&nbsp;<U+2014> which he publically {{sic}} (and in this proceeding) claims to love&nbsp;<U+2014> he should be deeply ashamed."<ref name="sawyer1021">{{Cite news   | last = Sawyer  | first = Rick  | title = Randazza Strikes Again: Glenn Beck is "the Butt"   | newspaper = [[Bostonist]]  | publisher = Gothamist LLC  | date = October 21, 2009  | url = http://bostonist.com/2009/10/21/randazza-glenn-beck.php  | accessdate = 2009-10-21}}</ref>

Abbott, the WIPO arbitrator, ruled that the domain name could be confused with the "Glenn Beck" mark.<ref name="glennbeckloses" /> On the issue of profit off Beck's mark, WIPO ruled, "While there is some evidence that at some stage third-party vendors of goods and services critical of [Beck] may have earned some income on sales of t-shirts and bumper stickers embodying political slogans based on click-throughs from [Eiland-Hall's] Web site, the panel does not believe this is sufficient 'commercial activity' to change the balance of interests already addressed."<ref name="wiporules" /> Abbott was the sole arbitrator on the WIPO panel.<ref>{{cite news   | last =Kuznia  | first =Rob   | title =Glenn Beck Loses Suit Over Controversial Domain Name  | work =HispanicBusiness.com  | publisher =Hispanic Business Inc.   | date =November 10, 2009  | url =http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/news/newsbyid.asp?idx=166251&cat1=newswire  | accessdate =  2009-11-10}}</ref>

{{Wikinews|Glenn Beck loses domain name case over parody website}}
Abbott concluded that Eiland-Hall had legitimate interests in the website's name, writing, "Respondent appears to the Panel to be engaged in a parody of the style or methodology that Respondent appears genuinely to believe is employed by Complainant in the provision of political commentary, and for that reason Respondent can be said to be making a political statement. This constitutes a legitimate non-commercial use of Complainant<U+2019>s mark under the Policy."<ref name="glennbeckloses" /> Abbott did not make a conclusion on the third point, but stated it would not be likely that Beck would have won on the "bad faith" matter.<ref name="glennbeckloses" /> Abbott wrote that the issue of determining whether the website is defamatory would not be an element for WIPO.<ref name="glennbeckloses" /> The WIPO instead limited the scope of the case to a determination of whether the website registrant had engaged in "abusive domain name registration and use".<ref name="wiporules" />

I chose to criticize you using the well-tested method of satire because of its effectiveness. But, humor aside, your rhetorical style is no laughing matter.

Instead, in legitimizing it by trying to take it down, many more people become aware of the meme&nbsp;<U+2013> and may start calling attention to situations where Beck (and others) make use of such tactics."<ref name="Techdirt 2009-10-04" /> Steffen Schmidt wrote of Beck's predicament in an article in the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'': "Although the mainstream media has avoided any mention of this rumor, Mr. Beck has quite a task ahead of him. Shutting down one web site is like trying to eradicate ''Pueraria lobata'' the dreaded Kudzu vine that is eating the South."<ref name="schmidt" /> The [[Citizen Media Law Project]] agreed with Levy and McSherry that Beck's trademark claim over the website was "preposterous", and noted: "Beck is only making matters worse for himself by threatening legal action against the website. Before, it was just another idiot meme among the oceans of idiot memes online. Now, it's creeping through the blogosphere toward the mainstream news. ... And Beck will be wishing he never called his lawyers in. Believe it."<ref name="Harvard CMLP 2009-09-11" />

Upon conclusion of the WIPO case, Glynnis MacNicol of ''Mediaite'' commented, "So, perhaps one lesson here is: live by the Constitution, put up with Internet by the Constitution."<ref>{{cite news   | last =MacNicol  | first =Glynnis   | title =Glenn Beck Loses Lawsuit Over <U+2018>Murder And Rape<U+2019> Website  | work =Mediaite  | publisher =www.mediaite.com  | date =November 10, 2009  | url =http://www.mediaite.com/online/glenn-beck-loses-lawsuit-over-murder-and-rape-website/  | accessdate = 2009-11-10 }}</ref> Ed Brayton of ''ScienceBlogs'' pointed out, "Ironically, Beck never did respond to Marc Randazza's motion for a stipulation that the panel would have to apply American law in deciding the case, but it didn't matter. He never really had a case even under the standards applicable by this international tribunal."<ref name="wellplayed">{{cite news   | last =Brayton  | first =Ed | title =Beck Loses Domain Dispute&nbsp;<U+2014> But Gets Web Site  | work =[[ScienceBlogs]]  | publisher =Seed Media Group  | date =November 9, 2009  | url =http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/11/beck_loses_domain_dispute_-_bu.php  | accessdate = 2009-11-10 }}</ref> Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after the conclusion of the case, Brayton commented, "Well played, sir.
