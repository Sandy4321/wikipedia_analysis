'''Johann Smidt''' ([[November 5]] [[1773]] &ndash; [[May 7]] [[1857]]) was an important [[Bremen]] [[politician]], [[theologian]], and founder of [[Bremerhaven]].

Smidt studied [[theology]] in [[University of Jena|Jena]], and was one of the founders of the [[Gesellschaft der freien M<U+00E4>nner]] (Community of free men).  He then became Professor of History at the ''Gymnasium illustre'' in his hometown.  He then became 'Syndikus' (company lawyer) for the <U+00C4>lterleute and in 1800 'Ratsherr' (councilman), a position in which he exerted considerable influence on the governmental and commercial development of the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]]. 

In particular as he acted as Bremen's diplomatic representative at the [[Congress of Vienna]] and preserved the independence of the Hanseatic cities and put through their acceptance into the [[German Confederation]] of sovereign states after the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813. In the final revision of the decisions of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, Smidt - unauthorised and unconsented by the other parties - changed the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''in''' the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which ensued serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''by''' the confederal states."<ref>In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des j<U+00FC>dischen Glaubens die denselben '''in''' ['''von''', respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits einger<U+00E4>umten Rechte erhalten." Cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den <U+00E4>ltesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition last time revised by the author himself: Berlin: arani, 1998, ISBN 3-7605-8673-2.</ref> In the Confederation's [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundesversammlung]], he battled the politics of [[Klemens Wenzel Lothar von Metternich]], and was particularly involved in the negotiations which in 1820 established free shipping on the [[Weser]].

Above all, he gave Bremen's commerce an important impulse through the foundation of [[Bremerhaven]] in 1827 and by closing advantageous trade agreements with foreign countries, through widening of consular representation, etc. In 1821 he became [[B<U+00FC>rgermeister]] of Bremen and he held this post &mdash; apart from the democratic period of 1849-1852 &mdash; until his death.

Smidt was a devout member of the [[Reformed Churches|Reformed church]], then Bremen's state church, later merged with [[Lutheran]] communities to form today's [[Evangelical Church of Bremen|Bremian Evangelical Church]]. He worked against tolerating other religions and denominations within the city. Inglorius was Smidt's [[anti-Judaism]]. As burgomaster, Smidt made the "complete expulsion of the children of Israel" an "urgent concern of the state" since 1821. [[Jews]] had settled within the city during its incorporation into the ephemeric [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] (1807-1810) and afterwards into [[First French Empire|France]] (1810-1813), when all inhabitants had become French citizens of equal status. All this ended in 1813/1815. Since it was the French state and not the [[Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], which had emancipated the Jews in Bremen, the city took the altered formulation of the Viennese decisions as the legal grounds to revoke - as did a number of confederal states - the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]] in its territory. In 1826, Smidt had met his goal with the exception of two '[[Schutzjude|Schutzjuden]]' taken over from neighbouring [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]].[http://www.gemeinden.judentum.de/bremen/index.htm] 

Also Bremen's Lutheran congregation, owning and using the [[Bremen Cathedral]], experienced Smidt's steady badgering. The cathedral district, a former [[Sovereign immunity|immunity]], used to be an extraterritorial enclave of the neighboured state of [[Bremen-Verden]] until 1803, when it was incorporated into the [[Free Imperial City]] of Bremen. As burgomaster Smidt confiscated the considerable [[Estate (law)|estates]] of the Lutheran congregation, arguing it would be a legal non-thing, null and void. The representatives of the Lutheran congregation, led by the cathedral preacher [[Johann David Nicolai]], started to fight for its right to exist. The fight lasted until the congregation's official recognition in 1830, asserted by a majority of Bremen's [[Senate#Alternative meanings|senator]]s (government members) against the expressed will of Smidt.<ref>Johann Christian Bosse and Hans Henry Lamotte, ''Der Dom zu Bremen'', 6th ed., Munich and Berlin: Deutscher Kunstverlag, 1990, (Gro<U+00DF>e Baudenkm<U+00E4>ler; No. 340), pp. 12seq.</ref> Smidt abused his governmental power to suppress the Lutheran congregation by way of ordinances, confiscation and public discreditation. 

Smidt dedicated himself to close cooperation between the Hanseatic cities.  In 'Anerkennung der Hilfe nach dem gro<U+00DF>en [[:de:Hamburger Brand|Hamburger Brand]]' (acknowledgement after the great Hamburg fire) in 1843, he was named an [[honorary citizen]] of [[Hamburg]].
