'''English literature''' is the [[literature]] written in the [[English language]], including literature composed in English by [[writer]]s not necessarily from [[England]]; for example, [[Robert Burns]] was [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[James Joyce]] was [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Joseph Conrad]] was [[Polish people|Polish]], [[Dylan Thomas]] was [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Thomas Pynchon]] is [[Americans|American]], [[V.S. Naipaul]] was born in [[Trinidad]], and [[Vladimir Nabokov]] was [[Russians|Russian]], but all are considered important writers in the history of English literature. In other words, English literature is as diverse as the varieties and dialects of English spoken around the world in countries originally colonized by the British. In [[academia]], the term often labels departments and programs practicing ''[[English studies]]'' in secondary and tertiary educational systems. Despite the variety of authors of English literature, the works of [[William Shakespeare]] remain paramount throughout the [[English-speaking world]].

Until the early 19th century, this article deals with literature from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] written in English; then America starts to produce major writers and works in literature. In the 20th century America and [[Ireland]] produced many of the most significant works of literature in English, and after [[World War II]] writers from the former [[British Empire]] also began to challenge writers from Britain. Additional information on literature in English from countries other than the UK and Ireland can be found in [[#See also|see also]] below.

==Old English literature: 450-1153==

[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|left|The first page of [[Beowulf]]]]
The first works in English, written in [[Old English]], appeared in the early [[Middle Ages]], the oldest surviving text being the ''[[Caedmon's Hymn|Hymn]]'' of [[C<U+00E6>dmon]]. The ''Hymn'' itself was composed between 658 and 680, recorded in the earlier part of the 8th century, and survives today in at least 14 verified manuscript copies. The ''Hymn'' is C<U+00E6>dmon's sole surviving composition. [[Orature|Oral tradition]] was very strong in early [[Anglo-Saxon England|English culture]] and most literary works were written to be performed. [[Epic poetry|Epic poems]] were thus very popular, and many, including ''[[Beowulf]]'', have survived to the present day in the rich corpus of [[Anglo-Saxon literature]] that closely resemble today's [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[North Frisian]] and the [[Northumbria]]n and [[Scots English]] dialects of modern English. Much Old English verse in the extant manuscripts is probably adapted from the earlier Germanic war poems from the continent. When such poetry was brought to England it was still being handed down orally from one generation to another, and the constant presence of [[alliterative verse]], or consonant rhyme (today's newspaper headlines and marketing abundantly use this technique such as in ''Big is Better'') helped the Anglo-Saxon people to remember it. Such rhyme is a feature of [[Germanic languages]] and is opposed to vocalic or end-rhyme of [[Romance languages]]. But the first written literature dates to the early Christian monasteries founded by [[Augustine of Canterbury]] and his disciples and it is reasonable to believe that it was somehow adapted to suit the needs of Christian readers.

[[Beowulf]] is the conventional title{{Sfn | Robinson | 2001 | ps =: <U+2018>Like most Old English poems, Beowulf has no title in the unique manuscript in which it survives (British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.xv, which was copied round the year 1000 AD), but modern scholars agree in naming it after the hero whose life is its subject.}} of an [[Old English language|Old English]] heroic [[epic poetry|epic poem]] consisting of 3182 [[Alliterative verse|alliterative long lines]], set in [[Scandza |Scandinavia]], commonly cited as one of the most important works of [[Anglo-Saxon literature]].

After Beowulf slays him, [[Grendel's mother]] attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to [[Geatland]] in [[Sweden]] and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a [[dragon]], but is fatally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants bury him in a [[tumulus]], a burial mound, in Geatland.

[[The Wanderer]] is an [[Old English]] poem preserved only in an anthology known as the [[Exeter Book]], a manuscript dating from the late 10th century. It counts 115 lines of [[alliterative verse]]. As often the case in [[Anglo-Saxon]] verse, the composer and compiler are anonymous, and within the manuscript the poem is untitled. The Wanderer conveys the meditations of a solitary exile on his past glories as a warrior in his lord's band of retainers, his present hardships and the values of forbearance and faith in the heavenly Lord. [[The Battle of Maldon (poem)|Battle  of Maldon]] is the name given to an [[Old English]] [[Old English literature|poem]] of uncertain date celebrating the real [[Battle of Maldon]] of 991, at which the Anglo-Saxons failed to prevent a [[Viking]] invasion.  Only 325 lines of the poem are extant; both the beginning and the ending are lost.

==Middle English literature: 1154-1485==
{{Main|Middle English literature}}

Religious literature continued to enjoy popularity and [[hagiography|Hagiographies]] were written, adapted and translated; for example, ''[[The Life of Saint Audrey]]'', [[Eadmer]]'s (ca. 1060 <U+2013> ca. 1126<ref>J. C. Rubenstein, <U+2018>Eadmer of Canterbury (b. c.1060, d. in or after 1126)<U+2019>, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8383, accessed 8 Feb 2011]</ref>) contemporary biography of [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and the ''[[South English Legendary]]''.

[[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]]s appear in English from the 13th century, with ''[[King Horn]]'' and ''[[Havelock the Dane]]'', based on Anglo-Norman originals such as the ''[[Romance of Horn]]''.<ref>name=Companion </ref> 

In the 12th century a new form of English now known as [[Middle English]] evolved. This is the earliest form of English which is comprehensible to modern readers and listeners, albeit not easily. [[Middle English Bible translations]], notably [[Wyclif's Bible]], helped to establish English as a literary language. [[Wycliffe's Bible]] is the name now given to a group of [[Bible translations]] into [[Middle English]] that were made under the direction of, or at the instigation of, [[John Wycliffe]]. They appeared over a period from approximately 1382 to 1395.<ref>{{Citation | title = Catholic Encyclopedia | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15367a.htm | contribution = Versions of the Bible | publisher = New advent}}.</ref> These Bible translations were the chief inspiration and chief cause of the [[Lollard]] movement, a pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] movement that rejected many of the distinctive teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], most Western Christian people encountered the Bible only in the form of oral versions of scriptures, verses and homilies in Latin (other sources were [[mystery plays]], usually conducted in the vernacular, and popular [[iconography]]). Though relatively few people could read at this time, Wycliffe<U+2019>s idea was to translate the Bible into the vernacular, saying "it helpeth Christian men to study the Gospel in that tongue in which they know best Christ<U+2019>s sentence".<ref>{{Citation | last = Robinson | first = Henry Wheeler | title = The Bible in its Ancient and English Versions | publisher = Greenwood Press | place = Westport, [[Connecticut | CT]], [[United States of America | USA]] | year = 1970 | pages = 137<U+2013>45}}.</ref> Although unauthorized, the work was popular and Wycliffite Bible texts are the most common manuscript literature in Middle English and over 250 manuscripts of the Wycliffite Bible survive.

At the end of the 12th century, [[Layamon]]'s ''[[Layamon's Brut|Brut]]'' adapted [[Wace]] to make the first English language work to discuss the legends of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. It was also the first historiography written in English since the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]].

''[[Piers Plowman]]'' (written ca. 1360 --1387) or ''Visio Willelmi de Petro Plowman'' (''William's Vision of Piers Plowman'') is a [[Middle English]] [[allegorical]] [[narrative poem]] by [[William Langland]]. It is written in unrhymed [[alliterative verse]] divided into sections called "passus" ([[Latin]] for "step"). ''Piers'' is considered by many critics to be one of the early great works of English literature, along with [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', during the Middle Ages. 

''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' is a late 14th-century [[Middle English]] [[Alliterative verse|alliterative]] [[chivalric romance|romance]]. It is one of the better-known Arthurian stories, of an established type known as the "beheading game". Developing from Welsh, Irish and English tradition ''Sir Gawain'' highlights the importance of honour and chivalry. It is an important poem in the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance genre]], which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest that tests his prowess. "Preserved in the same manuscript with Sir Gawayne were three other poems, now generally accepted as the work of its author. These are two alliterative poems of moral teaching, Patience and Purity, and an intricate elegiac poem, [[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]. The author of Sir Gawayne and the other poems is frequently referred to as 'the Pearl Poet.' " <ref> "Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight." Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.

[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer (17th century).jpg|thumb|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
Middle English lasts up until the 1470s, when the [[Chancery Standard]], a form of [[London]]-based English, became widespread and the printing press regularized the language. Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 <U+2013> 1400), known as the Father of English literature, is widely considered the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]] and was the first poet to have been buried in [[Poet's Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]]. Among his many works, which include ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', the ''[[House of Fame]]'', the ''[[Legend of Good Women]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', Chaucer is best known today for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''. This is a collection of stories written in [[Middle English]] (mostly written in [[verse (poetry)|verse]] although some are in [[prose]]), that are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from [[Southwark]] to the shrine of Saint [[Thomas Becket]] at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the [[The Tabard|Tabard Inn]] at [[Southwark]] on their return. Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of the [[vernacular]], [[Middle English]], at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin. The first recorded association of [[Valentine's Day]] with [[romantic love]] is in Chaucer's ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' of 1382.<ref>Oruch, Jack B., "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'', '''56''' (1981): 534<U+2013>65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be "the original mythmaker in this instance."

The multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the 14th century can be illustrated by the example of [[John Gower]] (c. 1330 <U+2013> October 1408).  A contemporary of [[William Langland]] and a personal friend of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], Gower is remembered primarily for three major works, the ''Mirroir de l'Omme'', ''[[Vox Clamantis]]'', and ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'', three long poems written in [[Anglo-Norman]], Latin and, Middle English respectively, which are united by common moral and political themes.<ref>{{cite DNB|Gower, John}}</ref>

Among the many religious works are those in the [[Katherine Group]] and the writings of [[Julian of Norwich]] and [[Richard Rolle]]. Julian's ''[[Revelations of Divine Love]]'' (circa 1393) is believed to be the first published book written by a woman in the English language; it chronicles, to some extent, her extensive [[pilgrimage]]s to various holy sites in Europe and Asia.<ref name="ec">{{cite book

''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', is Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s 15th century compilation of some French and English Arthurian romances, was among the earliest books printed in England. Printed by [[William Caxton|Caxton]] in 1485, it was popular and influential in the later revival of interest in the Arthurian legends. 

;Medieval drama
{{Main|Medieval theatre}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], drama in the vernacular languages of Europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the [[liturgy]]. [[Mystery play]]s were presented on the porch of the cathedrals or by strolling players on [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. [[Miracle play|Miracle]] and mystery plays, along with [[Morality play|moralities]] and interludes, later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama, such as was seen on the Elizabethan stages. Another form of medieval theatre was the [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]], a form of early street theatre associated with the [[Morris dance]], concentrating on themes such as [[Saint George]] and the [[European dragon|Dragon]] and [[Robin Hood]]. These were [[Folklore|folk tale]]s re-telling old stories, and the [[actor]]s travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality. 

[[Mystery plays]] and [[miracle plays]] (sometimes distinguished as two different forms,<ref>'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only. Miracle plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}</ref> although the terms are often used interchangeably) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval]] [[Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They developed from the 10th to the 16th century, reaching the height of their popularity in the 15th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre. The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]''  used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n<sup>1</sup> 9}}</ref> but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''misterium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', a play performed by the [[craft guilds]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|coauthors=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203<U+2013>204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}</ref>

There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late [[medieval period]]; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants. They were performed in the city of [[York]], from the middle of the fourteenth century until 1569. There are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays and most likely performed around the [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Feast of Corpus Christi]] probably in the town of [[Wakefield]], England during the late [[Middle Ages]] until 1576. The ''[[Ludus Coventriae]]'' (also called the [[N Town plays]]" or ''Hegge cycle''), now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]].

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}</ref>

Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, the [[morality play]] is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Tudor period|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment, which represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. In their own time, these plays were known as "interludes", a broader term given to dramas with or without a [[Morality|moral]] theme.<ref>Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).</ref> Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt him to choose a Godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. 

''The Somonyng of Everyman'' (''The Summoning of Everyman'') (c.1509-19), usually referred to simply as ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', is a late 15th-century English [[morality play]]. Like [[John Bunyan]]'s allegory ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'', ''Everyman'' (1678) examines the question of [[Christian salvation]] through the use of allegorical characters. The play is the allegorical accounting of the life of Everyman, who represents all mankind. In the course of the action, All the characters are also allegorical, each personifying an abstract idea such as Fellowship, (material) Goods, and Knowledge and the conflict between good and evil is dramatized by the interactions between characters.

===Renaissance literature: 1486-1625===
{{Main|English Renaissance}}

Following the introduction of a printing press into England by [[William Caxton]] in 1476, [[vernacular literature]] flourished. The [[English Reformation|Reformation]] inspired the production of [[vernacular]] [[liturgy]] which led to the [[Book of Common Prayer]], a lasting influence on literary English language. The poetry, drama, and prose produced under both [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|King James I]] constitute what is today labelled as Early modern (or Renaissance).

====Elizabethan era (1558-1603)====
{{Main|Elizabethan literature}} 
Also [[English Renaissance theatre]]
During the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (1558-1603) and then James I (1603<U+2013>25), in the late 16th and early 17th century, a London-centred culture, that was both [[court]]ly and popular, produced great poetry and drama. The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model: a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London. The linguist and lexicographer [[John Florio]] (1553<U+2013>1625), whose father was Italian, was a royal language tutor at the Court of [[James I of England|James I]], and a possible friend and influence on [[William Shakespeare]], had brought much of the [[Italian language]] and culture to England. He was also the translator of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] into English. The earliest Elizabethan plays includes ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561) by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Sackville]] and [[Thomas Norton|Norton]] and [[Thomas Kyd]]'s (1558<U+2013>94) ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (1592). ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]], or Hieronimo is Mad Again''<ref>http://www.archive.org/details/spanishtragedya00kydgoog</ref> is an [[Elizabethan]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Thomas Kyd]] between 1582 and 1592. Highly popular and influential in its time, ''The Spanish Tragedy'' established a new [[genre]] in English literature theatre, the [[revenge play]] or revenge tragedy. Its [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] contains several violent murders and includes as one of its [[fictional character|characters]] a [[personification]] of [[Revenge]]. ''The Spanish Tragedy'' was often referred to, or parodied, in works written by other Elizabethan [[playwrights]], including [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. Many elements of ''The Spanish Tragedy,'' such as the [[play-within-a-play]] used to trap a murderer and a [[ghost]] intent on vengeance, appear in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]].'' Thomas Kyd is frequently proposed as the author of the hypothetical ''[[Ur-Hamlet]]'' that may have been one of Shakespeare's primary sources for ''Hamlet''.

[[William Shakespeare]] stands out in this period as a [[poet]] and [[playwright]] as yet unsurpassed. Shakespeare was not a man of letters by profession, and probably had only some grammar school education. He was neither a lawyer, nor an aristocrat as the "university wits" that had monopolised the English stage when he started writing. But he was very gifted and versatile, and he surpassed "professionals" as [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]] who mocked this "shake-scene" of low origins. Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres, including [[Shakespearean history|histories]], [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], [[Shakespearean comedies|comedies]] and the late [[William Shakespeare's late romances|romances]], or tragicomedies. His early classical and Italianate comedies, like ''[[A Comedy of Errors]]'', containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid-1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his greatest comedies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=235}}.</ref> ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wood|2003|loc=161<U+2013>162}}.</ref> Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic ''[[The Merchant of Venice|Merchant of Venice]]'', can be problematic because of how it portrays [[Shylock]], a vengeful Jewish moneylender.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wood|2003|loc=205<U+2013>206}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|1998|loc=258}}.</ref> The wit and wordplay of ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'',<ref>{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=359}}.</ref> the charming rural setting of ''[[As You Like It]]'', and the lively merrymaking of ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=362<U+2013>383}}.</ref> After the lyrical ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, ''[[Henry IV, Part 1|Henry IV, parts 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|2]]'', and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shapiro|2005|loc=150}}; {{Harvnb|Gibbons|1993|loc=1}}; {{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=356}}.</ref> This period begins and ends with two tragedies: ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death;<ref>{{Harvnb|Wood|2003|loc=161}}; {{Harvnb|Honan|1998|loc=206}}.</ref> and ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''<U+2014>based on Sir [[Thomas North|Thomas North's]] 1579 translation of [[Plutarch|Plutarch's]] ''[[Parallel Lives]]''<U+2014>which introduced a new kind of drama.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ackroyd|2006|loc=353, 358}}; {{Harvnb|Shapiro|2005|loc=151<U+2013>153}}.</ref> In the early 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called "[[Shakespearean problem play|problem plays]]", ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', and ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'', as well as a number of his best known [[Shakespearean tragedy|tragedies]], including ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Anthony and Cleopatra]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=85}}; {{Harvnb|Muir|2005|loc=12<U+2013>16}}.</ref> The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bradley|1991|loc=40, 48}}.</ref> In his final period, Shakespeare turned to [[Shakespeare's late romances|romance]] or [[tragicomedy]] and completed three more major plays: ''[[Cymbeline]]'', ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tempest]]'', as well as the collaboration, ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dowden|1881|loc=57}}.</ref> Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dowden|1881|loc=60}}; {{Harvnb|Frye|2005|loc=123}}; {{Harvnb|McDonald|2006|loc=15}}.</ref> Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' and ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]'', probably with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|Taylor|Jowett|Montgomery|2005|loc=1247, 1279}}</ref>

Shakespeare also popularized the [[English sonnet]] which made significant changes to [[Petrarch]]'s model. A collection of 154 by [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]], dealing with themes such as the passage of time, love, beauty and mortality, were first published in a 1609 quarto entitled ''SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS.: Never before imprinted.'' (although sonnets [[Sonnet 138|138]] and [[Sonnet 144|144]] had previously been published in the 1599 [[miscellany]]  ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]''). The first 17 poems, traditionally called the [[procreation sonnets]], are addressed to a young man urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation.<ref>[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 439.</ref> Other sonnets express the speaker's love for a young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker's [[Shakespeare's sonnets#The Dark Lady|mistress]]; and pun on the poet's name. The final two sonnets are [[allegory|allegorical]] treatments of Greek [[epigrams]] referring to the "little love-god" [[Cupid]].

Other important figures in [[Elizabethan theatre]] include [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and [[Francis Beaumont]]. Had Marlowe (1564<U+2013>1593) not been stabbed at twenty-nine in a tavern brawl, says [[Anthony Burgess]], he might have rivalled, if not equalled Shakespeare himself for his poetic gifts. Remarkably, he was born only a few weeks before Shakespeare and must have known him. Marlowe's subject matter is different from Shakespeare's as it focuses more on the moral drama of the [[Polymath|Renaissance man]] than any other thing. Marlowe was fascinated and terrified by the new frontiers opened by modern [[science]]. Drawing on German lore, he introduced the story of [[Faust]] to England in his play [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]] (c.1592), about a scientist and magician who is obsessed by the thirst of knowledge and the desire to push man's technological power to its limits. He acquires supernatural gifts that even allow him to go back in time and wed Helen of [[Troy]], but at the end of his twenty-four years' covenant with the [[devil]] he has to surrender his [[soul]] to him. His dark heroes may have something of Marlowe himself, whose death remains a mystery. He was known for being an atheist, leading a lawless life, keeping many mistresses, consorting with ruffians and living the 'high life' of [[London]]'s underworld. But many suspect that this might have been a cover-up for his activities as a secret agent for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], hinting that the 'accidental stabbing' might have been a premeditated assassination by the enemies of [[The Crown]]. [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] are less-known, but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his best dramas, and were popular at the time. It is also at this time that the [[city comedy]] genre develops.

The sonnet was introduced into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] in the early 16th century.  In the later 16th century English poetry was characterised by elaboration of language and extensive allusion to classical myths. One of the most important poet of this period is [[Edmund Spenser]] author of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', an epic poem and fantastical [[allegory]] celebrating the [[Tudor dynasty]] and [[Elizabeth I]]. and [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]] (1554-1586) was an English poet, courtier and soldier, and is remembered as one of the most prominent figures of the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan Age]]. His works include ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'', ''[[The Defence of Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]''. Elizabeth I also produced [[occasional poems]] such as ''[[On Monsieur<U+2019>s Departure]]''. Poems intended to be set to music as songs, such as by [[Thomas Campion]], became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households. ''See [[English Madrigal School]]''.

====Jacobean literature (1603-25)====
{{See also|English Renaissance theatre}}

After Shakespeare's death, the poet and dramatist [[Ben Jonson]] was the leading literary figure of the [[Jacobean era]].  Jonson's aesthetics hark back to the Middle Ages and his characters embody the [[Humours|theory of humours]]. According to this contemporary medical theory, behavioral differences result from a prevalence of one of the body's four "humours" (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) over the other three; these humours correspond with the four elements of the universe: air, water, fire, and earth. However, the stock types of [[Latin literature]] were an equal influence.<ref>"Ben Jonson." ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online Academic Edition''. Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 20 September  2012. <http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127459/Ben Jonson.</ref> Jonson therefore tends to create types or caricatures. However, in his best work, characters are "so vitally rendered as to take on a being that transcends the type".<ref>"Ben Jonson." ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online Academic Edition''.</ref> He is a master of style, and a brilliant satirist. Jonson's famous comedy ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605 or 1606)) shows how a group of scammers are fooled by a top con-artist, vice being punished by vice, virtue meting out its reward. Other major plays by Jonson are ''[[Epicoene]]'' (1609), ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610), and ''[[Bartholomew Fair]]'' (1614).

Others who followed Jonson's style include [[Beaumont and Fletcher]], who wrote the popular comedy, ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'', a satire of the rising middle class, especially of those nouveaux riches who pretend to dictate literary taste without knowing much literature at all. In the story, a couple of grocers wrangle with professional actors to have their illiterate son play a leading role in a drama. He becomes a knight-errant wearing, appropriately, a burning pestle on his shield. Seeking to win a princess' heart, the young man is ridiculed much in the way [[Don Quixote]] was. One of Beaumont and Fletcher's skills was that of portraying of how feudalism and chivalry had turned into snobbery and make-believe and that new social classes were on the rise. 

Another popular style of theatre during Jacobean times was the [[revenge play]], which was popularized in the Elizabethan era by [[Thomas Kyd]] (1558-94) and then further developed later by [[John Webster]] (1578-1632). [[John Webster]]'s (ca.1580-ca.1634) most famous plays are ''[[The White Devil]]'' (1612) and ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' (1613). Other revenge tragedies include ''[[The Changeling (play)|The Changeling]]'' written by [[Thomas Middleton]] and [[William Rowley]], ''[[The Atheist's Tragedy]]'' by [[Cyril Tourneur]], first published in [[1611 in literature|1611]], [[Christopher Marlow]]'s ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'' by [[George Chapman]], ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (ca. 1603) of [[John Marston]] and [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]]'s ''[['Tis Pity She's a Whore]]''. Besides ''Hamlet'', other plays of Shakespeare's with at least some revenge elements, are ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''.

The [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]], one of the most massive translation projects in the history of English up to this time, was started in 1604 and completed in 1611. It represents the culmination of a tradition of [[English translations of the Bible|Bible translation into English]] that began with the work of [[William Tyndale]]. It became the standard [[Bible]] of the [[Church of England]]. This project was headed by James I himself, who supervised the work of forty-seven scholars. Although many other translations into English have been made, some of which are widely considered more accurate, many aesthetically prefer the King James Bible, whose meter is made to mimic the original Hebrew verse.

Besides Shakespeare the major poets of the early 17th century included the [[Metaphysical poet]]s [[John Donne]] (1572<U+2013>1631) and [[George Herbert]] (1593<U+2013>1633). Influenced by continental [[Baroque]], and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism, Donne's metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or "unpoetic" figures, such as a compass or a mosquito, to reach surprise effects. For example, in "Valediction: Forbidding Mourning", one of Donne's ''Songs and Sonnets'', the points of a compass represent two lovers, the woman who is home, waiting, being the centre, the farther point being her lover sailing away from her. But the larger the distance, the more the hands of the compass lean to each other: separation makes love grow fonder. The [[paradox]] or the [[oxymoron]] is a constant in this poetry whose fears and anxieties also speak of a world of spiritual certainties shaken by the modern discoveries of geography and science, one that is no longer the centre of the universe. [[George Chapman]] (?1559-?1634) wrote a couple revenge tragedies, but is remembered chiefly for his famous translation in 1616 of [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] into English verse. This was the first ever complete translations of either poem into the English language. The translation had a profound influence on English literature and inspired a sonnet from [[John Keats]]. The highly popular tale of the [[Trojan War]] had  previously only been available to English readers only in Medieval epic retellings, such as [[Caxton]]'s [[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]].

===The Caroline, Interregnum and Restoration periods (1625-1689)===
{{Main|Restoration Literature}}
[[File:Andrew Marvell Sketch.jpg|thumb|145k|left|Andrew Marvell (1621-1678)]]
The [[Metaphysical poet]]s [[John Donne]] (1572<U+2013>1631) and [[George Herbert]] (1593<U+2013>1633 were still alive after 1625, and later in the 17th century a second generation of metaphysical poets were writing, including [[Richard Crashaw]] (1613<U+2013>49), [[Andrew Marvell]] (1621<U+2013>1678), [[Thomas Traherne]] (1636 or 1637<U+2013>1674) and [[Henry Vaughan]] (1622<U+2013>1695). The [[Cavalier poet]]s were another important group of 17th century poets, who came from the classes that supported King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War]] (1642<U+2013>51). (King Charles reigned from 1625 and was executed 1649). The best known of the [[Cavalier]] poets are [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Lovelace]], [[Thomas Carew]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]]. They "were not a formal group, but all were influenced by" [[Ben Jonson]].<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'',ed. Margaret Drabble,p. 181.</ref> Most of the Cavalier poets were [[courtier]]s, with notable exceptions. For example, Robert Herrick was not a courtier, but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet. Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions, and are influence by [[Latin]] authors [[Horace]], [[Cicero]], and [[Ovid]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=Thomas|title=The Cavalier Mode from Jonson to Cotton by Earl Miner|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring|year=1974|volume=27|issue=1|pages=111|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2859327 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>

Restoration literature includes both ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and the [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|Earl of Rochester]]'s ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery|Sodom]],'' the high spirited sexual comedy of ''[[The Country Wife]]'' and the moral wisdom of ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]].'' It saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises on Government]],'' the founding of the [[Royal Society]], the experiments of [[Robert Boyle]] and the holy meditations of Boyle, the [[Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage|hysterical attacks on theatres]] from [[Jeremy Collier]], the pioneering of literary criticism from Dryden, and the first newspapers. The official break in literary culture caused by censorship and radically moralist standards under Cromwell's Puritan regime created a gap in literary tradition, allowing a seemingly fresh start for all forms of literature after the Restoration. During the Interregnum, the royalist forces attached to the court of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] went into exile with the twenty-year-old [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The nobility who travelled with Charles II were therefore lodged for over a decade in the midst of the continent's literary scene. Charles spent his time attending plays in France, and he developed a taste for [[Spanish language|Spanish]] plays. Those nobles living in Holland began to learn about mercantile exchange as well as the tolerant, [[Rationalism|rationalist]] prose debates that circulated in that officially tolerant nation.

[[John Milton]] is one of the greatest English poets, wrote at this time of religious flux and political upheaval. Milton best known for his epic poem [[Paradise Lost]] (1671). Among other important poems are:  ''[[L'Allegro]]'',1631; ''[[Il Penseroso]]''
1634; ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (a masque), 1638; ''[[Lycidas]]'';  ''[[Paradise Regained]]'', 1671; [[Samson Agonistes]], 1671. Milton's poetry and prose reflect deep personal convictions, a passion for freedom and self-determination, and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day. Writing in English, Latin, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime, and his celebrated [[Areopagitica]], written in condemnation of pre-publication censorship, is among history's most influential and impassioned defenses of free speech and freedom of the press. [[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the "greatest English author",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded "as one of the preeminent writers in the English language".<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism'', [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john "Milton, John <U+2013> Introduction"]</ref>

[[File:John Milton - Project Gutenberg eText 13619.jpg|thumb|174px|[[John Milton]], religious [[epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' published in 1667.]]The largest and most important poetic form of the era was satire. In general, publication of satire was done anonymously. There were great dangers in being associated with a satire. On the one hand, defamation law was a wide net, and it was difficult for a satirist to avoid prosecution if he were proven to have written a piece that seemed to criticize a noble. On the other hand, wealthy individuals would respond to satire as often as not by having the suspected poet physically attacked by ruffians. John Dryden was set upon for being merely ''suspected'' of having written the ''Satire on Mankind.'' A consequence of this anonymity is that a great many poems, some of them of merit, are unpublished and largely unknown.

[[John Dryden]] (1631-1700) was an influential English poet, literary critic, translator, and playwright who dominated the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden. He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the [[alexandrine]] and triplet into the form. In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet. Dryden's greatest achievements were in satiric verse in works like the mock-heroic ''[[MacFlecknoe]]'' (1682). [[W. H. Auden]] referred to him as "the master of the middle style" that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century.<ref>W. H. Auden, ''New Year Letter,'' in Collected Poems</ref> The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident from the elegies that it inspired.<ref>John Dryden, ''Major Works'', ed. by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), p.37.</ref> [[Alexander Pope]] (1688-1744) was heavily influenced by Dryden, and often borrowed from him; other writers in the 18th century were equally influenced by both Dryden and Pope. Though [[Ben Jonson]] had been poet laureate to James I, this was not then a formal position and the formal title of [[Poet Laureate]], as a royal office, was first conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in 1670. The post then became a regular British institution.

Prose in the Restoration period is dominated by [[Christianity|Christian]] religious writing, but the Restoration also saw the beginnings of two genres that would dominate later periods: [[fiction]] and journalism. Religious writing often strayed into political and economic writing, just as political and economic writing implied or directly addressed religion. The Restoration was also the time when [[John Locke]] wrote many of his philosophical works. Locke's empiricism was an attempt at understanding the basis of human understanding itself and thereby devising a proper manner for making sound decisions. These same scientific methods led Locke to his two ''Treatises on Government,'' which later inspired the thinkers in the [[American Revolution]]. As with his work on understanding, Locke moves from the most basic units of society toward the more elaborate, and, like Thomas Hobbes, he emphasizes the plastic nature of the social contract. For an age that had seen absolute monarchy overthrown, democracy attempted, democracy corrupted, and limited monarchy restored, only a flexible basis for government could be satisfying. The Restoration moderated most of the more strident sectarian writing, but radicalism persisted after the Restoration. Puritan authors such as [[John Milton]] were forced to retire from public life or adapt, and those [[Diggers|Digger]], [[Fifth Monarchy Men|Fifth Monarchist]], [[Levellers|Leveller]], [[Quakers|Quaker]], and [[Anabaptists|Anabaptist]] authors who had preached against monarchy and who had participated directly in the [[regicide]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] were partially suppressed. Consequently, violent writings were forced underground, and many of those who had served in the Interregnum attenuated their positions in the Restoration. [[John Bunyan]] stands out beyond other religious authors of the period. Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' is an [[allegory]] of personal salvation and a guide to the Christian life. Instead of any focus on [[eschatology]] or divine retribution, Bunyan instead writes about how the individual [[saint]] can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation. The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both [[drama]] and [[biography]], and yet it also shows an awareness of the grand allegorical tradition found in [[Edmund Spenser]]. During the Restoration period, the most common manner of getting news would have been a [[broadsheet]] publication. A single, large sheet of paper might have a written, usually partisan, account of an event. However, the period saw the beginnings of the first professional and periodical (meaning that the publication was regular) journalism in England. Journalism develops late, generally around the time of [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s claiming the throne in 1689. Coincidentally or by design, England began to have newspapers just when William came to court from [[Amsterdam]], where there were already newspapers being published.

It is impossible to satisfactorily date the beginning of the novel in English. However, long fiction and fictional biographies began to distinguish themselves from other forms in England during the Restoration period. An existing tradition of ''Romance'' fiction in [[France]] and [[Spain]] was popular in England. The "Romance" was considered a feminine form, and women were taxed with reading "novels" as a vice. One of the most significant figures in the rise of the novel in the Restoration period is [[Aphra Behn]]. She was not only the first professional female novelist, but she may be among the first professional novelists of either sex in England. Behn's most famous novel was ''[[Oroonoko]]'' in 1688. This was a biography of an entirely fictional African king who had been enslaved in [[Suriname]]. Behn's novels show the influence of [[tragedy]] and her experiences as a dramatist.

As soon as the previous Puritan regime's ban on public stage representations was lifted, the drama recreated itself quickly and abundantly. The most famous plays of the early Restoration period are the unsentimental or "hard" comedies of [[John Dryden]], [[William Wycherley]], and [[George Etherege]], which reflect the atmosphere at Court, and celebrate an aristocratic [[machismo|macho]] lifestyle of unremitting sexual intrigue and conquest. After a sharp drop in both quality and quantity in the 1680s, the mid-1690s saw a brief second flowering of the drama, especially comedy. Comedies like [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]'' (1700), and [[John Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Relapse]]'' (1696) and ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'' (1697) were "softer" and more middle-class in ethos, very different from the aristocratic [[extravaganza]] twenty years earlier, and aimed at a wider audience. The playwrights of the 1690s set out to appeal to more socially mixed audiences with a strong [[middle-class]] element, and to female spectators, for instance by moving the war between the sexes from the arena of intrigue into that of marriage. The focus in comedy is less on young lovers outwitting the older generation, more on marital relations.

===Augustan literature (1689-1750)===
{{Further|18th century literature}} {{Main|Augustan literature}}
During the 18th century literature reflected the worldview of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (or Age of Reason): a rational and scientific approach to religious, social, political, and economic issues that promoted a secular view of the world and a general sense of progress and perfectibility. Led by the philosophers who were inspired by the discoveries of the previous century by people like [[Isaac Newton]] and the writings of [[Descartes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. They sought to discover and to act upon universally valid principles governing humanity, nature, and society. They variously attacked spiritual and scientific authority, dogmatism, intolerance, censorship, and economic and social restraints. They considered the state the proper and rational instrument of progress. The extreme rationalism and skepticism of the age led naturally to deism; the same qualities played a part in bringing the later reaction of [[romanticism]]. The [[Encyclop<U+00E9>die]] of Denis Diderot epitomized the spirit of the age.

The term Augustan literature derives from authors of the 1720s and 1730s themselves, who responded to a term that [[George I of England]] preferred for himself. While George I meant the title to reflect his might, they instead saw in it a reflection of [[Ancient Rome]]'s transition from rough and ready literature to highly political and highly polished literature. Because of the aptness of the metaphor, the period from 1689 <U+2013> 1750 was called "the Augustan Age" by critics throughout the 18th century (including [[Voltaire]] and [[Oliver Goldsmith]]). The literature of the period is overtly political and thoroughly aware of critical dictates for literature. It is an age of exuberance and scandal, of enormous energy and inventiveness and outrage, that reflected an era when English, Scottish, and Irish people found themselves in the midst of an expanding economy, lowering barriers to education, and the stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

It was during this time that poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]]  (1700-48) produced his melancholy ''The Seasons'' (1728-30) and [[Edward Young]] (1681-1765) wrote his poem ''Night Thoughts'' (1742), though the most outstanding poet of the age is [[Alexander Pope]] (1688-1744). It is also the era that saw a serious competition over the proper model for the [[pastoral poetry|pastoral]]. In criticism, poets struggled with a doctrine of ''decorum,'' of matching proper words with proper sense and of achieving a diction that matched the gravity of a subject. At the same time, the [[mock-heroic]] was at its zenith. Pope's ''[[Rape of the Lock]]'' (1712-17) and ''[[The Dunciad]]'' (1728-43) are still the greatest mock-heroic poems ever written.<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (London: Penguin, 1999), p.514.</ref> Pope also translated  the ''[[Iliad]]'' (1715<U+2013>20) and  the ''[[Odyssey]]'' (1725-6). Since his death, Pope has been in a constant state of re-evaluation. His high artifice, strict prosody, and, at times, the sheer cruelty of his satire were an object of derision for the [[Romantic poets]], and it was not until the 1930s that his reputation was revived. Pope is now considered the dominant poetic voice of his century, a model of prosodic elegance, biting wit, and an enduring, demanding moral force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/apope/ |title=Alexander Pope |publisher=Poets.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref> 

In prose, the earlier part of the period was overshadowed by the development of the English essay. [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]]'s ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' established the form of the British periodical essay, inventing the pose of the detached observer of human life who can meditate upon the world without advocating any specific changes in it. Periodical essays bloomed into journalistic writings; such as [[Samuel Johnson]]<U+2019>s "Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput", titled to disguise the actual proceeding of parliament as it was illegal for any Parliamentary Reports to be reproduced in print. However, this was also the time when the English [[novel]], first emerging in the Restoration, developed into a major art form. [[Daniel Defoe]] turned from [[journalism]] and writing criminal lives for the press to writing fictional criminal lives with ''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress|Roxana]]'' and ''[[Moll Flanders]].'' He also wrote a fictional treatment of the travels of [[Alexander Selkirk]] called ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (1719). The novel would benefit indirectly from a tragedy of the stage, and in mid-century many more authors would begin to write novels.
[[File:Jonathan Swift by Charles Jervas detail.jpg|180px|thumb|left|[[Jonathan Swift]]]]
If Addison and Steele were dominant in one type of prose, then [[Jonathan Swift]] was in another. Swift's prose style is unmannered and direct, with a clarity that few contemporaries matched. He was a profound skeptic about the modern world, but he was similarly profoundly distrustful of nostalgia. He saw in history a record of lies and vanity, and he saw in the present a madness of vanity and lies. He believed that [[Christian]] values were essential, but these values had to be muscular and assertive and developed by constant rejection of the games of confidence men and their gulls. Swift's ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'' announced his skeptical analysis of the claims of the modern world, and his later prose works, such as his war with Patridge the astrologer, and most of all his attacks on pride in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', only left safe the individual who was in constant fear and humility. After his "exile" to [[Ireland]], Swift reluctantly began defending the Irish people from the predations of [[colonialism]]. His ''[[A Modest Proposal]]'' and the Drapier Letters provoked riots and arrests, but Swift, who had no love of Irish [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], was outraged by the abuses and barbarity he saw around him.

Drama in the early part of the period featured the last plays of [[John Vanbrugh]] and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]], both of whom carried on the Restoration comedy with some alterations. However, the majority of stagings were of lower [[farce]]s and much more serious and domestic tragedies. [[George Lillo]] and [[Richard Steele]] both produced highly moral forms of tragedy, where the characters and the concerns of the characters were wholly middle class or working class. This reflected a marked change in the audience for plays, as royal patronage was no longer the important part of theatrical success. Additionally, [[Colley Cibber]] and [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] began to battle each other for greater and greater spectacles to present on stage. The figure of [[Harlequin]] was introduced, and [[pantomime]] theatre began to be staged. This "low" comedy was quite popular, and the plays became tertiary to the staging. [[Opera]] also began to be popular in London, and there was significant literary resistance to this Italian incursion. This trend was broken only by a few attempts at a new type of comedy. Pope and [[John Arbuthnot]] and [[John Gay]] attempted a play entitled ''[[Three Hours After Marriage]]'' that failed. In 1728, however, John Gay returned to the playhouse with ''[[The Beggar's Opera]].'' Gay's opera was in English and retold the story of [[Jack Sheppard]] and [[Jonathan Wild]]. However, it seemed to be an allegory based on [[Robert Walpole]] and the directors of the South Sea Company, and so Gay's follow up opera was banned without a performance. The [[Licensing Act 1737]] brought an abrupt halt to much of the period's drama, as the theatres were once again brought under state control.

An effect of the Licensing Act was to cause more than one aspiring playwright to switch over to writing novels. [[Henry Fielding]] began to write prose satire and novels after his plays could not pass the censors. [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] also turned to novels. In the interim, [[Samuel Richardson]] had produced a novel intended to counter the deleterious effects of novels in ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740). Henry Fielding attacked the absurdity of this novel with two of his own works, ''[[Joseph Andrews]]'' and ''[[Shamela]]'', and then countered Richardson's ''[[Clarissa]]'' with ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]''. [[Henry Mackenzie]] wrote ''[[The Man of Feeling]]'' and indirectly began the [[sentimental novel]]. [[Laurence Sterne]] attempted a Swiftian novel with a unique perspective on the impossibility of biography (the model for most novels up to that point) and understanding with ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', even as his detractor [[Tobias Smollett]] elevated the [[picaresque novel]] with his works. Each of these novels represents a formal and thematic divergence from the others. Each novelist was in dialogue and competition with the others, and, in a sense, the novel established itself as a diverse and open-formed genre in this explosion of creativity. The most lasting effects of the experimentation would be the psychological realism of Richardson, the bemused narrative voice of Fielding, and the sentimentality of Brooke.

The [[graveyard poets]] were a number of pre-Romantic English poets, writing in the 1740s and later, whose works are characterised by their gloomy meditations on mortality, "skulls and coffins, epitaphs and worms" in the context of the graveyard.<ref>Line 23 of "The Grave" by  [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]].</ref> To this was added, by later practitioners, a feeling for the [[Sublime (philosophy)|'sublime']] and uncanny, and an interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry.<ref>William Harmon and C.

During the end of the 18th century, [[Horace Walpole]]'s 1764 novel ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', created the [[Gothic fiction]] genre, that combines elements of [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]. The pioneering gothic novelist [[Ann Radcliffe]] introduced the brooding figure of the gothic [[villain]] which developed into the [[Byronic hero]]. Her most popular and influential work ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'' 1795, is frequently cited as the archetypal Gothic novel. ''[[Vathek]]'' 1786 by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], and ''[[The Monk]]'' 1796 by [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]], were further notable early works in both the gothic and horror literary genres.

===Romanticism (1798-1837)===
{{Main|Romanticism}}
Various dates are given for the Romantic period in British literature. Here the publishing of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' in 1798 is taken as the beginning and the start of Queen Victoria's reign in 1837 as its end, even though, for example, William Wordsworth lived until 1850 and [[William Blake]] published before 1798.

The Romantic movement in English literature had its beginnings in the pre-Romantic poets, [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700<U+2013>48), [[Edward Young]] (1683-1765), [[Thomas Gray]] (1716<U+2013>71), [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]] (1699-1746), [[James Macpherson]] (1736<U+2013>96), [[Thomas Chatterton]] (1752<U+2013>70), [[William Cowper]] (1731-1800), ''etc''., the [[Gothic novel]] and the [[novel of sensibility]].<ref>J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionaryof Literary Rerms'', p.588; "Pre-Romanticism." Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica. Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Online Academic Edition.

A. Cuddon, p.588-9"/> [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757) was another important influence.<ref name="English Literature pp.957-8"/>

[[Robert Burns]] (1759-1796) was another pioneer of the [[Romantic movement]], and after his death he became a cultural icon in Scotland. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected [[Folk music|folk songs]] from across Scotland, often revising or [[Literary adaptation|adapting]] them. His ''Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect'' was published in 1786. Among poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world are, "[[Auld Lang Syne]]"; "[[A Red, Red Rose]]"; "[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]"; "[[To a Louse]]"; "[[To a Mouse]]"; "[[The Battle of Sherramuir]]"; "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]" and "[[Ae Fond Kiss]]".

The changing landscape of Britain brought about by the [[steam engine]] has two major outcomes: the boom of [[industrialism]] with the expansion of the city, and the consequent depopulation of the countryside as a result of the [[enclosure]]s. Most peasants poured into the city to work in the new factories. This abrupt change is revealed by the change of meaning in five key words: industry (once meaning "creativity"), democracy (once disparagingly used as "[[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]"), class (from now also used with a social connotation), art (once just meaning "craft"), culture (once only belonging to farming). But the poor condition of workers, the new class-conflicts and the pollution of the environment causes a reaction to [[urbanism]] and industrialisation prompting poets to rediscover the beauty and value of nature. Mother [[earth]] is seen as the only source of wisdom, the only solution to the ugliness caused by machines.
[[File:William Blake by Thomas Phillips.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[William Blake]] is considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]]]

The poet, painter, and printmaker [[William Blake]] (1757-1827) was one of the first of the Romantic poets. Although Blake was largely unrecognised during his lifetime, he is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]]. Considered mad by contemporaries for his idiosyncratic views, Blake is held in high regard by later critics for his expressiveness and creativity, and for the philosophical and mystical undercurrents within his work.
Among his most important works are ''[[Songs of Innocence]]'' (1789) and ''[[Songs of Experience]]'' (1794) "and profound and difficult 'prophecies' " such as ''[[Visions of the Daughters of Albion]]'' (1793), ''[[The First Book of Urizen]]'' (1794), ''[[Milton (poem)|Milton]]'' (1804<U+2013>?11]), and "Jerusalem: the Emanation of the Giant Albion" (1804<U+2013>?20).<ref>"William Blake."

Web. 2 October  2012. <http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/68793/William-Blake>.</ref> 

Among the earliest Romantics were the [[Lake Poets]], a small group of friends, including [[William Wordsworth]] (1770-1850), [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (1772-1834), [[Robert Southey]] (1774-1843) and journalist [[Thomas de Quincey]] (1785-1859). The early [[romantic poetry|Romantic Poets]] brought a new emotionalism and introspection, and their emergence is marked by the first romantic manifesto in English literature, the "Preface" to ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798). In it Wordsworth discusses what he sees as the elements of a new type of poetry, one based on the "real language of men" and which avoids the poetic diction of much 18th century poetry. Here, Wordsworth gives his famous definition of poetry, as "the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions recollected in tranquility" which "takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility." The poems in ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' were mostly by Wordsworth, although Coleridge contributed the long "[[Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]", a tragic ballad about the survival of one sailor through a series of supernatural events on his voyage through the south seas which involves the slaying of an albatross. Coleridge is also especially remembered for "[[Kubla Khan]]", "[[Frost at Midnight]]", "Dejection: an Ode", "[[Christabel (poem)|Chistabel]]" and his major prose work ''[[Biographia Literaria]]''. His critical work, especially on [[Shakespeare]], was highly influential, and he helped introduce [[German idealism|German idealist]] philosophy to English-speaking culture.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p.215.</ref> Coleridge and Wordsworth, along with [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], were a major influence, through [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], on American [[transcendentalism]].<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', pp.320, 1003.</ref> Coleridge and Wordsworth, however, understood romanticism in two entirely different ways: while Coleridge sought to make the supernatural "real", Wordsworth sought to stir the imagination of readers through his down-to-earth characters taken from real life, in "The Idiot Boy", for example, or the beauty of nature, especially the [[Lake District]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Among Wordsworth's most important poems, are "[[Michael]]", "[[Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey]]", "[[Resolution and Independence]]", "[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]" and the long, autobiographical, epic  ''[[The Prelude]]''. ''The Prelude'' was begun in 1799 but published posthumously in 1850.

[[File:Lord Byron coloured drawing.png|right|180px|thumb|[[Lord Byron]]]]
The second generation of Romantic poets includes [[Lord Byron]] (1788-1824), [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792-1822) and [[John Keats]] (1795-1821). Byron, however, was still influenced by 18th-century satirists and was, perhaps the least 'romantic' of the three. His amours with a number of prominent but married ladies was also a way to voice his dissent on the hypocrisy of a high society that was only apparently religious but in fact largely libertine, the same that had derided him for being physically impaired. His first trip to [[Europe]] resulted in the first two cantos of [[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]] (1812), a mock-heroic epic of a young man's adventures in Europe but also a sharp satire against London society. Despite ''Childe Harold'''s success on his return to England, accompanied by the publication of ''[[The Corsair]]'' (1813) his alleged incestuous affair with his half-sister Augusta Leigh in 1816 actually forced him to leave England for good and seek asylum on the continent. Here he joined Percy Bysshe Shelley, his wife Mary, with his secretary [[John William Polidori]] on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]] during the 'year without a summer' of 1816. Polidori's ''[[The Vampyre]]'' was published in 1819, creating the literary [[vampire literature|vampire genre]]. His short story was inspired by the life of Lord Byron and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]'' (1813).

Shelley is perhaps best known for poems such as ''[[Ozymandias]]'', ''[[Ode to the West Wind]]'', ''[[To a Skylark]]'', ''[[Music, When Soft Voices Die]]'', ''[[The Cloud (poem)|The Cloud]]'' and ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Adona<U+00EF>s]]'', an elegy written on the death of Keats. Shelley's early profession of atheism, in the tract "The Necessity of Atheism", led to his expulsion from Oxford and branded him as a radical agitator and thinker, setting an early pattern of marginalization and ostracism from the intellectual and political circles of his time. His close circle of admirers, however, included the most progressive thinkers of the day, including his future father-in-law, philosopher William Godwin. Shelley became an idol of the next three or four generations of poets, including important [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and Pre-Raphaelite poets such as [[Robert Browning]], and [[Dante Gabriel Rosetti]].    Shelley's influential poem ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' (1819) calls for nonviolence in protest and political action. It is perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of [[civil disobedience|nonviolent protest]].<ref name=AFP>http://www.morrissociety.org/JWMS/SP94.10.4.Nichols.pdf</ref> [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s passive resistance was influenced and inspired by Shelley's verse, and Gandhi would often quote the poem to vast audiences.<ref>Thomas Weber, "Gandhi as Disciple and Mentor," Cambridge University Press, 2004, pp. 28<U+2013>29.</ref>
[[File:RothwellMaryShelley.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Mary Shelley]]]]
The plot for [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (1818) is said to have come from a nightmare she had during stormy nights on Lake Geneva in the company of Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Polidori. Her idea of making a body with human parts stolen from different corpses and then animating it with [[electricity]] was perhaps influenced by [[Alessandro Volta]]'s invention and [[Luigi Galvani]]'s experiments with dead frogs. Frankenstein's chilling tale also suggests modern organ transplants, tissue regeneration, reminding us of the moral issues raised by today's medicine. But the creature of Frankenstein is incredibly romantic as well. Although "the monster" is intelligent, good and loving, he is shunned by everyone because of his ugliness and deformity, and the desperation and envy that result from social exclusion turn him against the very man who created him.

John Keats did not share Byron's and Shelley's extremely revolutionary ideals, but his cult of [[pantheism]] is as important as Shelley's. Keats was in love with the ancient stones of the [[Parthenon]] that Lord Elgin had brought to [[England]] from [[Greece]] (also known as the [[Elgin Marbles]]). He celebrates ancient Greece: the beauty of free, youthful love couples here with that of classical art. Keats's great attention to [[art]], especially in his "[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]" (1818) is quite new in romanticism, and it inspired [[Walter Pater]]'s and then [[Oscar Wilde]]'s belief in the absolute value of art as independent from [[aesthetics]].

Another important poet in this period was [[John Clare]] (1793-1864), Clare was the son of a farm labourer, who came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation for the changes taking place in rural England.<ref>Geoffrey Summerfield, in introduction to ''John Clare: Selected Poems'', Penguin Books 1990, pp 13<U+2013>22.  ISBN 0-14-043724-X</ref> His poetry underwent a major re-evaluation in the late 20th century and he is often now considered to be among the most important 19th-century poets.<ref>Sales, Roger  (2002) ''John Clare: A Literary Life''; Palgrave Macmillian ISBN 0-333-65270-3</ref> His biographer [[Jonathan Bate]] states that Clare was "the greatest labouring-class poet that England has ever produced. No one has ever written more powerfully of nature, of a rural childhood, and of the alienated and unstable self".<ref>Bate, Jonathan (2003) John Clare: A biography; Farrar, Straus and Giroux</ref>

One of the most popular novelist of the era was Sir [[Walter Scott]], whose grand historical romances inspired a generation of painters, composers, and writers throughout Europe. Scott's novel-writing career was launched in 1814 with ''[[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]]'', often called the first [[historical novel]], and was followed by ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. His popularity in England and further abroad did much to form the modern stereotype of Scottish culture. Other novels by Scott which contributed to the image of him as a Scottish patriot include ''[[Rob Roy (novel)|Rob Roy]]''.

[[Jane Austen]]'s works critique the [[sentimental novel|novels of sensibility]] of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th century realism.<ref>Litz, pp.3<U+2013>14; Grundy, "Jane Austen and Literary Traditions", ''The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen'', pp.192<U+2013>193; Waldron, "Critical Responses, Early", ''Jane Austen in Context'', p. 83, 89<U+2013>90; Duffy, "Criticism, 1814<U+2013>1870", ''The Jane Austen Companion'', pp.93<U+2013>94.</ref> Her plots, though fundamentally comic, highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security.<ref>A.

New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991. pp.66<U+2013>75; Collins, 160<U+2013>161.</ref> Austen brings to light the hardships women faced, who usually did not inherit money, could not work and where their only chance in life depended on the man they married. She reveals not only the difficulties women faced in her day, but also what was expected of men and of the careers they had to follow. This she does with wit and humour and with endings where all characters, good or bad, receive exactly what they deserve.  Her work brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews during her lifetime, but the publication in 1869 of her nephew's ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' introduced her to a wider public, and by the 1940s she had become accepted as a major writer. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship and the emergence of a [[Janeite]] fan culture. Austen's  works include ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1811), ''[[Mansfield Park]]'', ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'' and ''[[Emma]]''.
[[File:Last of the Mohicans, Merrill bear.jpg|thumb|left|<center> ''The Last of the Mohicans''<br>Illustration from 1896 edition,<br> by J.T. Merrill</center>]]
At this time in America the prolific and popular novelist [[James Fenimore Cooper]] (1789-1851) began publishing his historical romances of frontier and Indian life, to create a unique form of [[American literature]]. Cooper is best remembered for his numerous sea-stories and the [[historical novel]]s known as the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]''. Among his most famous works is the novel ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'' (1826). Later, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a significant [[Romantic movement]] in [[American literature]], which, though highly original, was influenced by British and European Romanticism. The years 1850-1855 were particularly significant, with the publishing of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s ''[[Representative Men]]'', [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' and ''[[The House of Seven Gables]]'', [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'', [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', and [[Walt Whitman]]'s ''[[Leaves of Grass]]''.<ref>Ann Woodlief, "American Romanticism  (or the American Renaissance): Introduction"

[[File:Charles Dickens 3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Charles Dickens]]]]

It was in the [[Victorian era]] (1837<U+2013>1901) that the novel became the leading [[literary genre]] in English. Another important fact is the number of women novelists who were successful in the 19th century, even though they often had to use a masculine pseudonym. The majority of readers were of course women. At the beginning of the 19th century most novels were published in three volumes. However, monthly serialization was revived with the publication of Charles Dickens' ''[[Pickwick Papers]]'' in twenty parts between April 1836 and November 1837. Demand was high for each episode to introduce some new element, whether it was a plot twist or a new character, so as to maintain the readers' interest. Both Dickens and Thackeray frequently published this way.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed. Marion Wynne-Davies. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), pp.97-8.</ref>

The 1830s and 1840s saw the rise of [[social novel]], also known as social problem novel,  that "arose out of the social and political upheavals which followed the [[Reform Act of 1832]]".<ref>''Bloomsbury Guide'', p. 101.</ref> This was in many ways a reaction to  rapid [[industrialization]], and the social, political and economic issues associated with it, and was a means of commenting on abuses of government and industry and the suffering of the poor, who were not profiting from England's economic prosperity.<ref>"James, Louis(2006)"</ref> Stories of the working class poor were directed toward middle class to help create sympathy and promote change. An early example is [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837-8). 
[[Charles Dickens]] emerged on the literary scene in the 1830s with the two novels already mentioned. Dickens wrote vividly about London life and struggles of the poor,  but in a good-humoured fashion, accessible to readers of all classes. One of his most popular works to this day is  ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843). In more recent years Dickens has been most admired for his later novels, such as ''[[Dombey and Son]]'' (1846-8), ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860-1),''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852-3) and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'' (1855-7) and ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'' (1864-5). An early rival to Dickens was [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], who during the Victorian period ranked second only to him, but he is now much less read and is known almost exclusively for ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1847). In that novel he satirizes whole swaths of humanity while retaining a light touch. It features his most memorable character, the engagingly roguish Becky Sharp. The [[Bront<U+00EB>]] sisters were other significant novelists in the 1840s and 1850s. Their novels caused a sensation when they were first published but were subsequently accepted as classics. They had written compulsively from early childhood and were first published, at their own expense, in 1846 as poets under the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. The sisters returned to prose, producing a novel each the following year: Charlotte's ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Emily's ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'' and Anne's ''[[Agnes Grey]]''. Later, Anne's ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) and Charlotte's ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' (1853) were published. [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] was also a successful writer and first novel, ''[[Mary Barton]]'', was published anonymously in 1848. Gaskell's ''[[North and South (1855 novel)|North and South]]'' contrasts the lifestyle in the industrial north of England with the wealthier south. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, Gaskell usually frames her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes: her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She always emphasised the role of women, with complex narratives and dynamic female characters.<ref>Abrams, M.H., et al. (Eds.) "Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810<U+2013>1865". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, The Major Authors: The Romantic Period through the Twentieth Century'', 7th ed., Vol. B. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. ISBN 0-393-97304-2. DDC 820.8<U+2014>dc21. LC PR1109.N6.</ref> [[Anthony Trollope]]'s (1815<U+2013>82) was one of the most successful, prolific and respected English novelists of the Victorian era.  Some of his best-loved works are set in the imaginary county of [[Barsetshire]], including ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) and ''[[Barchester Towers]]'' (1857). He also wrote perceptive novels on political, social, and gender issues, and on other topical matters, including ''The Way with Live Now'' (1875). Trollope's novels portrayed the lives of the landowning and professional classes of early Victorian England. [[George Eliot]]'s (Mary Ann Evans (1819<U+2013>80), first novel ''[[Adam Bede]]'' was published in 1859. Her works, especially ''[[Middlemarch]]'' 1871-2), are important examples of [[literary realism]], and are admired for their combination of high [[Victorian literature|Victorian literary]] detail combined with an intellectual breadth that removes them from the narrow geographic confines they often depict. 
[[File:H.G. Wells , c1890.jpg|thumb|H. G. Wells studying in London, taken c. 1890]]
An interest in rural matters and the changing social and economic situation of the countryside is seen in the novels of [[Thomas Hardy]] (1840-1928). A Victorian realist, in the tradition of [[George Eliot]], he was also influenced both in his novels and poetry by [[Romanticism]], especially by [[William Wordsworth]].<ref>Dennis Taylor, "Hardy and Wordsworth". Victorian Poetry, vol.24, no.4, Winter, 1986.</ref> [[Charles Darwin]] is another important influence on Thomas Hardy.<ref>Gillian Beer, ''Darwin's Plots''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009.</ref> Like Charles Dickens he was also highly critical of much in Victorian society, though Hardy focussed more on a declining rural society. While Hardy wrote poetry throughout his life, and regarded himself primarily as a poet, his first collection was not published until 1898, so that initially he gained fame as the author of such novels as, ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1874), ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' (1886),  ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891), and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'' (1895). He ceased writing novels following adverse criticism of this last novel. In novels such as ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' and ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' Hardy attempts to create modern works in the genre of [[tragedy]], that are modelled on the Greek drama, especially [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], though in prose, not poetry, fiction, not a play, and with characters of low social standing, not nobility.<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/pva187.html  "Aristotelian Tragedy and the Novels of Thomas Hardy"]</ref> Another significant late 19th century novelist is [[George Robert Gissing]] (1857-1903) who published 23 novels between 1880 and 1903. His best known novel is ''[[New Grub Street]]'' (1891).
Important developments occurred in genre fiction in this era. 

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the 19th century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866-1946) writing career began in the 1890s with [[science fiction]] novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828-1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).

By the mid-19th-century, the pre-eminence of literature from the British Isles began to be challenged by writers from the former American colonies. This included one of the creators of the new genre of the short story, and inventor of the detective story Edgar Allan Poe (1809<U+2013>49). Among the significant American novelists were Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804<U+2013>64), Herman Melville (1819<U+2013>91), and Mark Twain (1835-1910). The essayists Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803<U+2013>82) and Henry David Thoreau (1817<U+2013>62) are also included in the Canon of major writers.
[[File:Nathaniel Hawthorne old.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].]]
In 1837, the young [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] (1804<U+2013>1864) collected some of his stories as ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'', a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents. Hawthorne went on to write full-length "romances", quasi-allegorical novels that explore such themes as guilt, pride, and emotional repression in his native [[New England]]. His masterpiece, ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (1850), is the stark drama of a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery. Hawthorne's fiction had a profound impact on his friend [[Herman Melville]] (1819<U+2013>1891), who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic and sensational sea narrative novels. Inspired by Hawthorne's focus on allegories and dark psychology, Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation. In ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession, the nature of evil, and human struggle against the elements. In another important work, the short novel ''[[Billy Budd (novel)|Billy Budd]]'', Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war. His books sold poorly, and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death, but Melville was rediscovered in the early decades of the 20th century.

=====Genre fiction=====
The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' (1865), and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872), tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. [[Bram Stoker]]'s horror story ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897), belongs to a number of [[literary genre]]s, including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].
[[File:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six [[short stories]] featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[Dr. Watson]]. The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'', in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novel]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894). An important forerunner of modernist literature, [[Joseph Conrad]] published the novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' in 1899. A [[symbolism|symbolic]] story within a story, or [[frame narrative]], about an Englishman Marlow's journey to the Belgian Congo.

[[children's literature|Literature for children]] developed as a separate genre. Some works become internationally known, such as those of [[Lewis Carroll]], ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''. [[Adventure novel]]s, such as those of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850<U+2013>94), are generally classified as for children. Stevenson's ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' (1886), depicts the [[multiple personality disorder|dual personality]] of a kind and intelligent physician who turns into a psychopathic monster after imbibing a drug intended to separate good from evil in a personality. His ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' (1886) is a fast-paced [[historical novel]] set in the aftermath of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]], and ''[[Treasure Island]]'' 1883, is the classic [[Piracy|pirate]] adventure. At the end of the Victorian era and leading into the Edwardian era, [[Beatrix Potter]] was an author and illustrator, best known for her children<U+2019>s books, which featured animal characters. In her thirties, Potter published the highly successful children's book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' in 1902. Potter eventually went on to published 23 children's books and become a wealthly woman.

====Victorian poetry====
[[File:Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson by George Frederic Watts.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]]]
The leading poets during the Victorian period were [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] (1809-1892), [[Robert Browning]] (1812<U+2013>89), [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] (1806<U+2013>61), and [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822<U+2013>88). The poetry of this period was heavily influenced by the [[Romantics]], but also went off in its own directions. Particularly notable was the development of the [[dramatic monologue]], a form used by many poets in this period, but perfected by Browning. Literary criticism in the 20th century gradually drew attention to the links between Victorian poetry and modernism.<ref>Carol T. Christ, ''Victorian and Modern Poetics''. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,1986); "Robert Browning", ''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature''. (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990), p.373.</ref>

Tennyson was [[Poet Laureate]] of the United Kingdom during much of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign. He was described by T. S. Eliot, as "the greatest master of metrics as well as melancholia", and as having "the finest ear of any English poet since Milton".<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p.981.</ref> Browning main achievement was in [[dramatic monologue]]s such as "[[My Last Duchess]]", "[[Andrea del Sarto]]" and "The Bishop Orders his Tomb", which were published in his two-volume ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' in 1855. In his introduction to the Oxford University Press edition of Browning's ''Poems 1833-1864'', Ian Jack comments, that [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T S Eliot]] "all learned from Browning's exploration of the possibilities of dramatic poetry and of colloquial idiom".<ref>{{cite book|last=Browning|title=Browning Poetical Works 1833-1864|editor=Ian Jack|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1970|chapter=Introduction|isbn=019254165}}</ref> Tennyson was also a pioneer in the use of the dramatic monologue, in "[[The Lotus-Eaters]]" (1833), "[[Ulysses (poem)|Ulysses]]" (1842), and '"[[Tithonus]]" (1860).<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', p.468.</ref>  While [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]] was the wife of Robert Browning she had established her reputation as a major poet before she met him. Her most famous work is the sequence of 44 sonnets "[[Sonnets from the Portuguese]]" published in ''Poems'' (1850).<ref>,''The Bloomsbury Guide bro English Literature'', p.372.</ref> [[Matthew Arnold]]'s reputation as a poet has declined in recent years and he is best remembered now for his critical works, like ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869), and his 1867 poem "[[Dover Beach]]". This poem depicts a nightmarish world from which the old religious verities have receded. It is sometimes held up as an early, if not the first, example of the modern sensibility. The influence of [[William Wordsworth]], both in ideas and in diction, is unmistakable in Arnold's best poetry, and Arnold has been seen as a bridge between [[Romanticism]] and [[Modernism]], because of his use of symbolic landscapes was typical of the Romantic era, while his skeptical and pessimistic perspective was typical of the Modern era. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] (1828-1882) was a poet, illustrator, painter and translator. He founded the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in 1848 with [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]], and was later to be the main inspiration for a second generation of artists and writers influenced by the movement, most notably [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]].<ref>''The Cambridge history of English and American literature: An encyclopedia in eighteen volumes'', ed. by A.W. Ward, A.R. Waller, W.P. Trent, J. Erskine, S.P. Sherman, and C. Van Doren. (New York: G.P. Putnam<U+2019>s Sons University Press, 1907<U+2013>21).</ref> Rossetti's art was characterised by its sensuality and its medieval revivalism.<ref>''A handbook to Literature'', ed William Harmon & C. Hugh Holman. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1996), 407.</ref> Poetry and image are closely entwined in Rossetti's work and he frequently wrote sonnets to accompany his pictures. He also illustrated poems by his sister [[Christina Rossetti]] such as ''[[Goblin Market]]''. 

While [[Arthur Clough]] (1819<U+2013>61) was a more minor figure of this era, he has been described as "a fine poet whose experiments in extending the range of literary language and subject were ahead of his time".<ref>[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/clough/bio.html "Arthur Hugh Clough <U+2014> A Brief Biography", Glenn Everett]</ref>

Towards the end of the 19th century, English poets began to take an interest in French [[Symbolist poetry|Symbolism]] and Victorian poetry entered a decadent ''[[Fin de si<U+00E8>cle|fin-de-si<U+00E8>cle]]'' phase.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Two groups of poets emerged, the ''[[The Yellow Book|Yellow Book]]'' poets who adhered to the tenets of [[Aestheticism]], including [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Arthur Symons]] and the [[Rhymers' Club]] group, that included [[Ernest Dowson]], [[Lionel Johnson]] and Irishman [[William Butler Yeats]]. Yeats went on to become an important modernist in the 20th century. Also in the 1890s [[A. E. Housman]] published at his own expense ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'', a cycle of 63 poems, because he could not find a publisher. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success, and its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before [[World War I]], when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' has been in print continuously since May 1896. The poems are pervaded by deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Housman wrote most of them while living in [[Highgate]], London, before ever visiting that part of Shropshire (about thirty miles from his birthplace), which he presented in an idealised pastoral light, as his 'land of lost content'.<ref>A.. E Housman, ''A Shropshire Lad'', XL</ref>

The [[nonsense verse]] of [[Edward Lear]], along with the novels and poems of [[Lewis Carroll]], is regarded as a precursor of [[surrealism]].<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/edward-lear].</ref> In 1846 Lear published ''[[:s:A Book of Nonsense|A Book of Nonsense]]'', a volume of limericks that went through three editions and helped popularise the form. In 1865 ''The History of the Seven Families of the Lake Pipple-Popple'' was published, and in 1867 his most famous piece of nonsense, ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat]]'', which he wrote for the children of his patron [[Edward Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby]]. Many other works followed. Lewis Carrroll's most famous writings are ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1865) and its sequel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', as well as the poems "[[The Hunting of the Snark]]" and "[[Jabberwocky]]". 

Writers of comic verse included the dramatist, librettist, poet and illustrator [[W. S. Gilbert]](1836-1911), who is best known for his fourteen [[comic opera]]s<!--His and Sullivan's preferred term. The G&S Project [[WP:G&S]] uses this term for all of their works.--> produced in [[Gilbert and Sullivan|collaboration]] with the composer Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]], of which the most famous include ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, ''[[The Mikado]]''.<ref>Kenrick, John.

Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty''] accessed 13 October 2006.</ref>

In the 21st century two Victorian poets who published little in the 19th century, [[Thomas Hardy]] (1840-1928) and [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] (1844<U+2013>89), are now regarded as major poets. While Hardy first established his reputation the late 19th century with novels, he also wrote poetry throughout his career. However he did not publish his first collection until 1898, so that he tends to be treated as a 20th century poet. Hopkins ''Poems'' were published posthumously by Robert Bridges in 1918. Hopkins' poem "[[The Wreck of the Deutschland]]", written in 1875, first introduced what Hopkins called "[[sprung rhythm]]."<ref>[http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poem/1051.html Online text and basic information]</ref> As well as developing new rhythmic effects, Hopkins "was also very interested in ways of rejuvenating poetic language" and frequently "employed compound and unusual word combinations".<ref name="poets.org">[http://www.poets.org/gmhop/]</ref> Several 20th century poets, including [[W.H. Auden]], [[Dylan Thomas]], and American [[Charles Wright (poet)|Charles Wright]], "turned to his work for its inventiveness and rich aural patterning".<ref name="poets.org"/>

America also produced major poets in the 19th century, such as [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830<U+2013>86) and [[Walt Whitman]] (1819<U+2013>92). America's two greatest 19th century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style. [[Walt Whitman]] (1819<U+2013>1892) was a working man, a traveler, a self-appointed nurse during the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865), and a poetic innovator. His major work was ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'', in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of American democracy. Whitman was also a poet of the body, or "the body electric," as he called it. In ''[[Studies in Classic American Literature]]'', the English novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]] wrote that Whitman "was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something 'superior' and 'above' the flesh". [[Emily Dickinson]] (1830<U+2013>1886), on the other hand, lived the sheltered life of a genteel, unmarried woman in small-town [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. Within its formal structure, her poetry is ingenious, witty, exquisitely wrought, and psychologically penetrating. Her work was unconventional for its day, and little of it was published during her lifetime. Many of her poems dwell on death, often with a mischievous twist. One, "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]", begins, "He kindly stopped for me." The opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet: "I'm nobody! Who are you? / Are you nobody too?"

====Victorian drama====
A change came in the [[Victorian era]] with a profusion on the London stage of [[farce]]s, [[Victorian burlesque|musical burlesques]], [[extravaganza]]s and [[comic opera]]s that competed with productions of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays and serious drama by dramatists like of [[James Planch<U+00E9>]] and [[Thomas William Robertson]].  In 1855, the [[German Reed Entertainments]] began a process of elevating the level of (formerly risqu<U+00E9>) musical theatre in Britain that culminated in the famous series of comic operas by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and were followed by the 1890s with the first [[Edwardian musical comedies]]. The length of runs in the theatre changed rapidly during the Victorian period.  As transportation improved, poverty in London diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously.  Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values.  The first play to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the London comedy ''[[Our Boys]]'', opening in 1875.  Its astonishing new record of 1,362 performances was bested in 1892 by ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''.<ref>[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&&&www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html Article on long-runs in the theatre before 1920]</ref>  Several of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[comic opera]]s broke the 500-performance barrier, beginning with ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878, and [[Alfred Cellier]] and [[B. C. Stephenson]]'s 1886 hit, ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'', ran for 931 performances. After [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Oscar Wilde]] became the leading poet and dramatist of the late Victorian period. Wilde's plays, in particular, stand apart from the many now forgotten plays of Victorian times and have a much closer relationship to those of the [[Edwardian]] dramatists such as Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1856-1950), whose career began in the last decade of the 19th century, Wilde's 1895 comic masterpiece, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'', holds an ironic mirror to the aristocracy and displays a mastery of wit and paradoxical wisdom.

[[File:Kiplingcropped.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Rudyard Kipling]]]]

===1901-1939 Modernism===
A major British lyric poet of the first decades of the 20th century was [[Thomas Hardy]] (1840-1928). Though not a modernist Hardy was is an important transitional figure between the Victorian era and the 20th-century. A major novelists of the late 19th-century, Hardy lived well into the third decade of the 20th-century, but because of the adverse criticism of his last novel, ''[[Jude the Obscure]]'', in 1895, from that time Hardy concentrated on publishing poetry. On the other hand another significant late 19th-century novelist, [[Henry James]] (1843-1916), continued to publish major works into the 20th-century.  James had lived in Europe since 1875 and became a British citizen, but this was only in 1915, and he was born in America and spent his formative years there.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), p.632.</ref> Another immigrant, Polish-born modernist novelist [[Joseph Conrad]] (1857-1924) published his first important work, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' in 1899 and [[Lord Jim]] in 1900. The American exponent of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s (1871-1945) ''[[Sister Carrie]]'' was also published in 1900. However, the Victorian [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]'s (1844<U+2013>89) highly original poetry was not published until 1918, long after his death, while another major modernist poet, Irishman W. B. Yeats's (1865-1939), career began late in the Victorian era. Yeats was one of the foremost figures of [[20th century in literature|20th century literature]]. A pillar of both the Irish and British literary establishments, in his later years he served as an Irish [[Seanad <U+00C9>ireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] for two terms. Yeats was a driving force behind the [[Irish Literary Revival]].  In 1923 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] as the first Irishman so honoured<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1923/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1923]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 3 June 2007.</ref> Yeats is generally considered one of the few writers who completed their greatest works after being awarded the Nobel Prize; such works include ''[[The Tower (book)|The Tower]]'' (1928) and ''The Winding Stair and Other Poems'' (1929).<ref>Frenz, Horst (Edit.)

But while [[modernism]] was to become an important literary movement in the early decades of the new century, there were also many fine writers who, like Thomas Hardy, were not modernists. Irish playwrights [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1856-1950) and [[J.M. Synge]] (1871-1909) were influential in British drama. Shaw's career began in the last decade of the 19th-century, while Synge's plays belong to the first decade of the 20th-century. Synge's most famous play, ''[[The Playboy of the Western World]]'', "caused outrage and riots when it was first performed" in Dublin in 1907.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature.'' (1996), p.781.</ref> George Bernard Shaw turned the [[Edwardian]] theatre into an arena for debate about important political and social issues, like marriage, class, "the morality of armaments and war" and the rights of women.<ref>"English literature."

Also in the 1920s and later [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] (1899-1973) achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as ''[[Hay Fever]]'' (1925), ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930), ''[[Design for Living]]'' (1932), ''[[Present Laughter]]'' (1942) and ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' (1941), have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. In the 1930s [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Christopher Isherwood]] co-authored verse dramas, of which [[The Ascent of F6]] (1936) is the most notable, that owed much to [[Bertolt Brecht]]. [[T. S. Eliot]] had begun this attempt to revive poetic drama with ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]'' in 1932, and this was followed by ''[[The Rock (play)|The Rock]]'' (1934), ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' (1935) and ''[[Family Reunion]]'' (1939). There were three further plays after the war. Novelists, who are not considered modernists, include: [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865-1936) who was also a successful poet; [[H. G. Wells]] (1866-1946); [[John Galsworthy]] (1867-1933), ([[Nobel Prize]] in Literature, 1932) whose works include a sequence of novels, collectively called ''[[The Forsyte Saga]]'' (1906<U+2013>21); [[Arnold Bennett]] (1867-1931) author of ''[[The Old Wives' Tale]]'' (1908); [[G. K. Chesterton]] (1874-1936); and [[E.M. Forster]]'s (1879-1970), though Forster's work is "frequently regarded as containing both modernist and Victorian elements".<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'', ed.

Other novels include ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''Mr Polly'' (1910). Forster's most famous work, ''[[A Passage to India]]'' 1924, reflected challenges to imperialism, while his earlier novels, such as ''[[A Room with a View]]''(1908) and ''[[Howards End]]'' (1910), examined the restrictions and hypocrisy of Edwardian society in England. The most popular British writer of the early years of the 20th century was arguably [[Rudyard Kipling]], a highly versatile writer of novels, short stories and poems, and to date the youngest ever recipient of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (1907). Kipling's works include ''[[The Jungle Books]]'' (1894-5), ''[[The Man Who Would Be King]]'' and ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' (1901), while his inspirational poem "[[If<U+2014>]]" (1895)  is a national favourite and a memorable evocation of  [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[stoicism]]. Kipling's reputation declined during his lifetime, but more recently postcolonial studies has "rekindled an intense interest in his work, viewing it as both symptomatic and critical of imperialist attitudes".<ref>"Rudyard Kipling."

Chesterton]] was a prolific and hugely influential writer with a diverse output. His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]], who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' published in 1908 is arguably his best-known novel. Of his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise.

The [[Georgian poets]] like Rupert Brooke (1887 -1915), [[Walter de la Mare]] (1873 <U+2013> 1956), [[John Masefield]] (1878 - 1967, Poet Laureate from 1930) maintained a more conservative approach to poetry by combining romanticism, sentimentality and hedonism, sandwiched as they were between the Victorian era, with its strict classicism, and Modernism, with its strident rejection of pure aestheticism. [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] (1878 - 1917) is sometimes treated as another Georgian poet.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble, pp. 988. 377.</ref> Thomas enlisted in 1915 and is one of the [[First World War]] poets along with [[Wilfred Owen]] (1893 -1918), [[Rupert Brooke]] (1887 -1915), [[Isaac Rosenberg]] (1890 -1917), [[Edmund Blunden]] (1896 -1974) and [[Siegfried Sassoon]] (1886 -1967).

(New York: Harcourt Brace), 1999), p.167.</ref> The movement was influenced by the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] (1809<U+2013>82) (''[[On Origin of Species]]'') (1859), [[Ernst Mach]] (1838-1916), [[Henri Bergson]] (1859-1941), [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844-1900), [[James G. Frazer]] (1854-1941), [[Karl Marx]] (1818<U+2013>83) (''[[Das Kapital]]'', 1867), and the psychoanalytic theories of  [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856-1939), among others.<ref>M. H. Abrams, p.167.</ref> The continental art movements of [[Impressionism]], and later [[Cubism]], were also important inspirations for modernist writers.<ref>M. H. Abrams, p.168.</ref> Important literary precursors of modernism, were: [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] (1821<U+2013>81) (''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (1866), ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (1880); [[Walt Whitman]] (1819<U+2013>92) (''[[Leaves of Grass]]'') (1855<U+2013>91); [[Charles Baudelaire]] (1821<U+2013>67) (''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''), [[Rimbaud]] (1854<U+2013>91) (''[[Illuminations (poems)|Illuminations]]'', 1874); [[August Strindberg]] (1849<U+2013>1912), especially his later plays.<ref>Marshall Berman, ''All that is Solid Melts into Air''. (Harmsworth: Penguin,1988), p.23.</ref> 

[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[James Joyce]], 1918]]
Among important early modernists were the [[American poets]] [[T. S. Eliot]] (1888-1965) and [[Ezra Pound]] (1885-1972). Eliot became a British citizen in 1927 but was born and educated in America. His most famous works are: "[[Prufrock]]" (1915), ''[[The Wasteland]]'' (1921) and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1935<U+2013>42). Ezra Pound was not only a major poet, first publishing part of  ''[[The Cantos]]'' in 1917, but an important mentor for other poets, most significantly in his editorial advice for Eliot's poem ''The Wasteland''.<ref name="English Literature p.791">''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble, p.791.</ref> Other important American poets writing early in the 20th-century were [[William Carlos Williams]] (1883-1963), [[Robert Frost]] (1874-1963), who published his first collection in England in 1913, and [[H.D.]] (1886-1961). [[Gertrude Stein]] (1874-1946), an American expatriate living in Paris, famous for her line "[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]],"  was also an important literary force during this time period. American poet [[Marianne Moore]] (1887-1972) published from the 1920s to the 1960s.

Among novelist important early figures were [[Dorothy Richardson]] (1873-1957), whose novel ''Pointed Roof'' (1915), is one of the earliest example of the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique and [[D. H. Lawrence]] (1885-1930), who published ''[[The Rainbow]]'' in 1915, though it was immediately seized by the police.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble, p. 562.</ref> Then in 1922 Irishman [[James Joyce]]'s important modernist novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' appeared.  ''Ulysses'' has been called "a demonstration and summation of the entire movement".<ref>Beebe, Maurice (Fall 1972). "Ulysses and the Age of Modernism". [[James Joyce Quarterly]] (University of Tulsa) 10 (1): p. 176.</ref> Set during one day in [[Dublin]], in it Joyce creates parallels with [[Homer]]'s [[epic poem]] the [[Odyssey]]. [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929) is another significant modernist novel, that uses the [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] technique.

The modernist movement continued through the 1920s and 1930s and beyond. During the period between the World Wars, American drama came to maturity, thanks in large part to the works of [[Eugene O'Neill]] (1888-1953). O'Neill's experiments with theatrical form and his use of both [[Naturalism (theatre)|Naturalist]] and [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] techniques had a major influence on American dramatists. His best-known plays include ''[[Anna Christie]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1922), ''[[Desire Under the Elms]]'' (1924), ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1928), ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931). In poetry [[Hart Crane]] published ''The Bridge'' in 1930 and [[E. E. Cummings]] and [[Wallace Stevens]] were publishing from the 1920s until the 1950s. Similarly William Faulkner continued to publish until the 1950s and was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1949. However, not all those writing in these years were modernists, this includes Americans novelists [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Dos Passos]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Scott Fitzgerald]] (''The Great Gatsby'' 1925), and [[John Steinbeck]]. 

[[File:Virginia Woolf by George Charles Beresford (1902).jpg|160px|right|thumb|[[Virginia Woolf]]]]
Important British writers between the [[World Wars]], include the  Scottish poet [[Hugh MacDiarmid]] (1892-1978), who began publishing in the 1920s, and novelists [[Virginia Woolf]] (1882-1941), [[E. M. Forster]] (1879-1970) (''[[A Passage to India]]'', 1924), [[Evelyn Waugh]] (1903<U+2013>66), [[P. G. Wodehouse]] (1881-1975) (who was not a modernist) and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Lawrence's ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' was published privately in Florence in 1928, though the unexpurgated version was not published in Britain until 1959.<ref name="English Literature p.791"/> Woolf was an influential [[Feminism|feminist]], and a major stylistic innovator associated with the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] technique in novels like ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925) and ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927). Her 1929 essay ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' contains her famous dictum; "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction".<ref>Sue Roe and Susan Sellers ''The Cambridge companion to Virginia Woolf''. (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p.219.</ref> 
An important development, beginning really in the 1930s and 1940s was a tradition of working class novels that were actually written by writers who had a working-class background. Among these were coal miner [[Jack Jones (novelist)|Jack Jones]], [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]], whose father was a stoker and who also went to sea as a young man, and other coal miner authors' [[Lewis Jones (writer)|Lewis Jones]] from [[South Wales]] and [[Harold Heslop]] from [[County Durham]].

[[Aldous Huxley]] (1894-1963) published his famous [[dystopia]] ''[[Brave New World]]'' in 1932, the same year as [[John Cowper Powys]]'s  ''[[A Glastonbury Romance]]''. [[Henry Miller]]'s ''[[Tropic of Cancer]]'' then appeared in 1934, though it was banned for many years in both Britain and America.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble, p.660</ref> [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906<U+2013>89) published his first major work, the novel ''Murphy'' in 1938. This same year [[Graham Greene]]'s (1904<U+2013>91) first major novel ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'' was published. Then in 1939 [[James Joyce]]'s published ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. In this work Joyce creates a special language to express the consciousness of  a character who is dreaming.<ref>''The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature'',  p.644.</ref> It was also in 1939 that another Irish modernist, [[W. B. Yeats]], died. British poet [[W. H. Auden]] was another significant modernists in the 1930s.

===1940 to the 21st Century===
Though some have seen modernism ending by around 1939,<ref>Kevin J. H. Dettmar "Modernism". David Scott Kastan, ed., ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature''. Oxford University Press 2005. <http://www.oxfordreference.com 27 October 2011</ref> with regard to English literature, "When (if) modernism petered out and postmodernism began has been contested almost as hotly as when the transition from Victorianism to modernism occurred".<ref>"modernism", ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online.

Eliot]], [[William Faulkner]],  [[Dorothy Richardson]], and [[Ezra Pound]]. Furthermore [[Basil Bunting]], born in 1901, published little until ''[[Briggflatts]]'' in 1965 and French-resident, Irishman [[Samuel Beckett]], born in 1906, continued to produce significant works until the 1980s, including ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1953), ''[[Happy Days]]'' (1961), ''[[Rockaby]]'' (1981), though some view him as a [[post-modernist]].<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Irish Literature'', ed. John Wilson Foster. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006.</ref>

[[File:GeoreOrwell.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[George Orwell]]]]
Among British writers in the 1940s and 1950s were novelist [[Graham Greene]] whose works span the 1930s to the 1980s and poet [[Dylan Thomas]], while [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[W.H. Auden]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] continued publishing significant work. In 1947 [[Malcolm Lowry]] published ''[[Under the Volcano]]'', while [[George Orwell]]'s satire of totalitarianism, ''1984'', was published in 1949. One of the most influential novels of the immediate post-war period was [[William Cooper (novelist)|William Cooper]]'s naturalistic ''Scenes from Provincial Life'', a conscious rejection of the modernist tradition.<ref>Bradbury, Malcolm. Introduction to Scenes from Provincial Life, Macmillan, London, 1969.</ref> [[Graham Greene]] was a convert to Catholicism and his novels explore the ambivalent moral and political issues of the modern world. Notable for an ability to combine serious literary acclaim with broad popularity, his novels include ''[[Brighton Rock (novel)|Brighton Rock]]'' (1938), ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' (1940), ''[[The Heart of the Matter]]'' (1948), ''[[A Burnt-Out Case]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Human Factor]]'' (1978). Other novelists writing in the 1950s and later were: [[Anthony Powell]] whose twelve-volume cycle of novels ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time]]'', is a comic examination of movements and manners, power and passivity in English political, cultural and military life in the mid-20th century; comic novelist [[Kingsley Amis]] is best known for his academic satire ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954); [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] laureate [[William Golding]]'s [[Allegory|allegorical]] novel ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' 1954, explores how culture created by man fails, using as an example a group of British schoolboys marooned on a deserted island who try to govern themselves, but with disastrous results. Philosopher [[Iris Murdoch]] was a prolific writer of novels throughout the second half of the 20th century, that deal especially with sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious, including ''[[Under the Net]]'' (1954), ''The Black Prince'' (1973) and ''The Green Knight'' (1993). Scottish writer [[Muriel Spark]] pushed the boundaries of realism in her novels. Her first, ''[[The Comforters]]'' (1957) concerns a woman who becomes aware that she is a character in a novel; [[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'']] (1961), at times takes the reader briefly into the distant future, to see the various fates that befall its characters. [[Anthony Burgess]] is especially remembered for his [[dystopian]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1962), set in the not-too-distant future, which was made into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1971. In the entirely different genre of [[Gothic fantasy]] [[Mervyn Peake]] (1911<U+2013>68) published his highly successful [[Gormenghast trilogy]] between 1946 and 1959.

[[Doris Lessing]] from [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]), published her first novel ''The Grass is Singing'' in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the nobel prize for literature in 2007. Other works by her include a sequence of five novels collectively called ''Children of Violence'' (1952<U+2013>69),  ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'' (1962), ''[[The Good Terrorist]]'' (1985), and a sequence of five [[science fiction]] novels the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]: Archives'' (1979<U+2013>1983). Indeed from 1950 on a significant number of major writers came from countries that had over the centuries been settled by the British, other than America which had been producing significant writers from at least the [[Victorian period]]. There had of course been a few important works in English prior to 1950 from the then [[British Empire]].  [[Olive Schreiner]]'s famous novel ''[[The Story of an African Farm]]'' was published in 1883 and [[New Zealand]]er [[Katherine Mansfield]] published her first collection of short stories, ''In a German Pension'', in 1911. The first major novelist, writing in English, from the [[Indian sub-continent]], [[R. K. Narayan]], began publishing in England in the 1930s, thanks to the encouragement of English novelist [[Graham Greene]].<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', ed. Margaret Drabble, p.697.</ref> Caribbean writer [[Jean Rhys]]'s writing career began as early as 1928, though her most famous work, ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'', was not published until 1966. [[Alan Paton]]'s famous ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' dates from 1948. 
[[File:Doris lessing 20060312.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Doris Lessing]], Cologne, 2006]]<br /> From [[Nigeria]] a number of writers have achieved an international reputation for works in English, including novelist [[Chinua Achebe]], who published ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' in 1958, as well as playwright [[Wole Soyinka]] and novelist [[Buchi Emecheta]]. Soyinka won the [[Nobel Prize]] for literature in 1986, as did [[South Africa]]n novelist [[Nadine Gordimer]] in 1995. Other South African writers in English are novelist [[J.M. Coetzee]] (Nobel Prize 2003) and playwright [[Athol Fugard]]. [[Kenya]]'s most internationally renown author is [[Ng<U+0169>g<U+0129> wa Thiong'o]] who has written novels, plays and short stories in English. Poet  [[Derek Walcott]], from [[St Lucia]] in the Caribbean, was another Nobel Prize winner in 1992. Two Irishmen and an [[Australia]]n were also winners in the period after 1940: novelist and playwright, [[Samuel Beckett]] (1969); poet [[Seamus Heaney]] (1995), who though he was British, from [[Northern Ireland]]], emigrated to the [[Irish Republic]]; [[Patrick White]] (1973) a major novelist in this period, whose first work was published in 1939. Another noteworthy Australian writer at the end of this period is poet [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]]. Northern Ireland has also produced other major poets, including [[Paul Muldoon]] and [[Derek Mahon]]. While [[Scotland]] has in the late 20th-century  produced several important novelists, including [[James Kelman]] who like Samuel Beckett can create humour out of the most grim situations. ''[[How Late it Was, How Late]]'', 1994, won the [[Booker Prize]] that year; [[A. L. Kennedy]] whose 2007 novel  ''[[Day (2007 novel)|Day]]'' was named Book of the Year in the [[Costa Book Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/costa2007/story/0,,2245282,00.html|title=Perfect Day for AL Kennedy as she takes Costa book prize|work=The Guardian|date=23 January 2008|accessdate=2008-01-23 | location=London | first=Mark | last=Brown}}</ref> In 2007 she won the [[Austrian State Prize for European Literature]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://salzburg.orf.at/stories/295874/|title=Literatur-Staatspreis an Britin verliehen|work=ORF Salzburg (Austrian Broadcasting Company)|date=27 July 2008|accessdate=2008-07-27}}</ref> [[Alasdair Gray]] whose ''[[Lanark: A Life in Four Books]]'' (1981) is a [[dystopia]]n fantasy set in his home town [[Glasgow]].

Among [[Canadian]] writers who have achieved an international reputation, are novelist and poet [[Margaret Atwood]], poet, song writer and novelist [[Leonard Cohen]], short story writer [[Alice Munro]], and more recently poet [[Anne Carson]]. Another admired Canadian novelist and poet is [[Michael Ondaatje]], who was born in [[Sri Lanka]]. 

An important cultural movement in the British theatre which developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s was [[Kitchen sink realism]] (or "kitchen sink drama"), a term coined to describe art (the term itself derives from an expressionist painting by [[John Bratby]]), novels, film and [[television play]]s. The term [[angry young men]] was often applied members of this artistic movement. It used a style of [[social realism]] which depicts the domestic lives of the working class, to explore social issues and political issues. The [[drawing room play]]s of the post war period, typical of dramatists like [[Terence Rattigan]] and [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] were challenged in the 1950s by these [[Angry Young Men]], in plays like [[John Osborne]]'s  ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' (1956). [[Arnold Wesker]] and [[Nell Dunn]] also brought social concerns to the stage. 

Again In the 1950s, the  [[Absurdism|absurdist]] play ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1955) (originally ''[[En attendant Godot]]'', 1952), by the French resident, Irishman [[Samuel Beckett]] profoundly affected British drama. The [[Theatre of the Absurd]] influenced [[Harold Pinter]] (1930-), (The Birthday Party, 1958), whose works are often characterised by menace or claustrophobia. Beckett also influenced [[Tom Stoppard]] (1937-) (''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead'',1966). Stoppard's works are however also notable for their high-spirited wit and the great range of intellectual issues which he tackles in different plays. Both Pinter and Stoppard continued to have new plays produced into the 1990s. [[Michael Frayn]] (1933- ) is among other playwrights noted for their use of language and ideas. He is also a novelist. 

Other Important playwrights whose careers began later in the century are: [[Caryl Churchill]] (''[[Top Girls]]'', 1982) and [[Alan Ayckbourn]] (''[[Absurd Person Singular]]'', 1972).
[[File:Burgess1.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Anthony Burgess]]]]

An important new element in the world of British drama, from the beginnings of radio in the 1920s, was the commissioning of plays, or the adaption of existing plays, by BBC radio. This was especially important in the1950s and 1960s (and from the 1960s for television). Many major British playwrights in fact, either effectively began their careers with the BBC, or had works adapted for radio. Most of playwright [[Caryl Churchill]]'s early experiences with professional drama production were as a radio playwright and, starting in 1962 with ''The Ants'', there were nine productions with BBC radio drama up until 1973 when her stage work began to be recognised at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].<ref>[http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsC/churchill-caryl.html]</ref> [[Joe Orton]]'s dramatic debut in 1963 was the radio play ''The Ruffian on the Stair'', which was broadcast on 31 August 1964.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.irdp.co.uk/radiodrama.htm Tim Crook, "International radio drama"]</ref> [[Tom Stoppard]]'s "first professional production was in the fifteen minute ''Just Before Midnight'' programme on BBC Radio, which showcased new dramatists".<ref name="autogenerated1"/> [[John Mortimer]] made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955, with his adaptation of his own novel ''Like Men Betrayed'' for the [[BBC]] [[Light Programme]]. But he made his debut as an original playwright with ''[[The Dock Brief]]'', starring [[Michael Hordern]] as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on [[BBC Radio]]'s [[Third Programme]], later televised with the same cast, and subsequently presented in a double bill with ''What Shall We Tell Caroline?'' at the [[Lyric Hammersmith]] in April 1958, before transferring to the [[Garrick Theatre]]. Mortimer is most famous for [[Rumpole of the Bailey]] a [[British television]] series which starred [[Leo McKern]] as Horace Rumpole, an aging London barrister who defends any and all clients. It has been spun off into a series of short stories, novels, and radio programmes.<ref>"John Mortimer Radio Plays": [http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/jmortimer.html; [http://www.filmreference.com/film/69/John-Mortimer.html John Mortimer Biography (1923-2009)]</ref> 

Other notable radio dramatists included [[Brendan Behan]], and novelist [[Angela Carter]]. Novelist [[Susan Hill]] also wrote for BBC radio, from the early 1970s.<ref>[http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/]</ref> Irish playwright [[Brendan Behan]], author of  ''[[The Quare Fellow]]'' (1954), was commissioned by the BBC to write a radio play ''The Big House'' (1956); prior to this he had written two plays ''Moving Out''and ''A Garden Party'' for Irish radio.<ref>''The Columbia encyclopedia of modern drama'', by Gabrielle H. Cody; "Brendan Behan" - RT<U+00C9> Archives [http://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/925-brendan-behan/]</ref>

Among the most famous works created for radio, are [[Dylan Thomas]]'s ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'' (1954), [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[All That Fall]]'' (1957), [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[A Slight Ache]]'' (1959) and [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'' (1954).<ref>J. C. Trewin, "Critic on the Hearth." ''Listener'' [London, England] 5 Aug. 1954: 224.</ref> [[Samuel Beckett]] wrote a number of short radio plays in the 1950s and 1960s, and later for television. Beckett's radio play  ''[[Embers]]'' was first broadcast on the [[BBC Third Programme]] on 24 June 1959, and won the RAI prize at the [[Prix Italia]] awards later that year.<ref>[http://www.prixitalia.rai.it/2008/pdf/vincitori_edizionipassate_en.pdf Prix Italia "PAST EDITIONS&nbsp;<U+2014> WINNERS 1949 - 2007"]</ref>

While poets T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden and Dylan Thomas were still publishing in this period, new poets starting their careers in the 1950s and 1960s included [[Philip Larkin]] (1922<U+2013>85) (''The Whitsun Weddings'',1964), [[Ted Hughes]] (1930<U+2013>98) (''The Hawk in the Rain'',1957) and [[Seamus Heaney]] (1939- ) (''Death of a Naturalist'', 1966), a Catholic from [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] who rejected his British identity and lived in the Republic of Ireland for much of his later life. Northern Ireland has also produced a number of other significant poets, including [[Derek Mahon]] and [[Paul Muldoon]]. In the 1960s and 1970s [[Martian poetry]] aimed to break the grip of 'the familiar', by describing ordinary things in unfamiliar ways, as though, for example, through the eyes of a Martian. Poets most closely associated with it are [[Craig Raine]] and [[Christopher Reid]]. [[Martin Amis]], an important contemporary novelist, carried into fiction this drive to make the familiar strange. Another literary movement in this period was the [[British Poetry Revival]] was a wide-reaching collection of groupings and subgroupings that embraces [[performance poetry|performance]], [[sound poetry|sound]] and [[concrete poetry]]. Leading poets associated with this movement include [[J. H. Prynne]], [[Eric Mottram]], [[Tom Raworth]], [[Denise Riley]] and [[Lee Harwood]]. The [[Liverpool poets|Mersey Beat poets]] were [[Adrian Henri]], [[Brian Patten]] and [[Roger McGough]]. Their work was a self-conscious attempt at creating an English equivalent to the Beats. Many of their poems were written in protest against the established social order and, particularly, the threat of nuclear war. Other noteworthy later 20th century poets are Welshman [[R. S. Thomas]], [[Geoffrey Hill]], [[Charles Tomlinson]] and [[Carol Ann Duffy]], who is the current poet laureate. [[Geoffrey Hill]] (1932- ) is considered one of the most distinguished English poets of his generation,<ref name="Harold Bloom 1986">Harold Bloom, ed. ''Geoffrey Hill (Bloom's Modern Critical Views)'', Infobase Publishing, 1986.</ref> Although frequently described as a "difficult" poet, Hill has retorted that poetry supposed to be difficult can be "the most democratic because you are doing your audience the honour of supposing they are intelligent human beings".<ref>{{cite news|title=Carol Ann Duffy is 'wrong' about poetry, says Geoffrey Hill|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jan/31/carol-ann-duffy-oxford-professory-poetry|accessdate=4 November 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=31 January 2012}}</ref> [[Charles Tomlinson]] (1927-) is another important English poet of an older generation, though "since his first publication in 1951, has built a career that has seen more notice in the international scene than in his native England; this may explain, and be explained by, his international vision of poetry".<ref name="carcanet.co.uk">[http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?owner_id=770 Carcanet Press page for Charles Tomlinson]</ref> The critic Michael Hennessy has described Tomlinson as "the most international and least provincial English poet of his generation".<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/charles-tomlinson]</ref> His poetry has won international recognition and has received many prizes in Europe and the United States.<ref name="carcanet.co.uk"/>

One of Penguin Books most successful publications in the 1970s was [[Richard Adams]]'s [[heroic fantasy]] ''[[Watership Down]]'' (1972). Evoking [[Epic poetry|epic]] themes, it recounts the odyssey of a group of rabbits seeking to establish a new home. Another successful novel of the same era was [[John Fowles]]' ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969), with a narrator who freely admits the fictive nature of his story, and its famous alternative endings. This was made into a film in 1981 with a screenplay by [[Harold Pinter]]. [[Angela Carter]] (1940-1992) was a novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism, and picaresque works. Writing from the 1960s until the 1980s, her novels include, ''[[The Infernal Desire Machines of Doctor Hoffman]]'' 1972 and ''[[Nights at the Circus]]'' 1984. [[Margaret Drabble]] (1939- ) is a novelist, biographer and critic, who published from the 1960s into the 21st century. Her older sister, [[A. S. Byatt]] (1936- ) is best known for ''[[Possession (novel)|Possession]]'' published in 1990.  

[[Salman Rushdie]] is among a number of post Second World War writers from the former British colonies who permanently settled in Britain. Rushdie achieved fame with ''[[Midnight's Children]]'' 1981, which was awarded both the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and [[Booker prize]], and was named [[The Best of the Booker|Booker of Bookers]] in 1993. His most controversial novel ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' 1989, was inspired in part by the life of Muhammad. [[V. S. Naipaul]] (1932- ), born in [[Trinidad]], was another immigrant, who wrote among other things ''A House for Mr Biswas'' (1961) and ''[[A Bend in the River]]'' (1979). Naipaul won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name="nobelweb">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2001/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org}}</ref> Also from the [[West Indies]] is [[George Lamming]] (1927- ), who wrote ''In the Castle of the Skin'' (1953), while from [[Pakistan]], came [[Hanif Kureshi]] (1954-), a playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, novelist and short story writer. His book ''The Buddha of Suburbia'' (1990) won the [[Whitbread Award]] for the best first novel, and was also made into a BBC television series.

===Post-modern literature===
{{Main|Postmodern literature}}
The term Postmodern literature is used to describe certain tendencies in post-World War II literature. It is both a continuation of the experimentation championed by writers of the modernist period (relying heavily, for example, on fragmentation, paradox, questionable narrators, etc.) and a reaction against Enlightenment ideas implicit in Modernist literature. Postmodern literature, like postmodernism as a whole, is difficult to define and there is little agreement on the exact characteristics, scope, and importance of postmodern literature. Among postmodern writers are the Americans [[Henry Miller]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Hunter S. Thompson]], [[Truman Capote]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]].

===20th century genre literature===
[[Agatha Christie]] (1890-1976) was a crime writer of novels, short stories and plays, who is best remembered for her 80 [[detective novel]]s as well as her successful plays for the West End theatre. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]], have given her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and she was one of the most important and innovative writers in this genre. Christie's novels include, ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' and ''[[And Then There Were None]]''. Another popular writer during the Golden Age of detective fiction was [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (1893-1957). Other recent noteworthy writers in this genre are [[Ruth Rendell]], [[P. D. James]] and Scot [[Ian Rankin]].

[[Robert Erskine Childers|Erskine Childers]] ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' 1903, is an early example of the [[spy novel]]. A noted writer in the [[spy novel]] genre was [[John le Carr<U+00E9>]], while in [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] writing, [[Ian Fleming]] created the character [[James Bond 007]] in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953), ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954), ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958), ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959), ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' (1961), and nine [[short story]] works. 

Hungarian-born [[Baroness Emma Orczy]]'s (1865-1947) original play, ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', opened in October 1903 at Nottingham<U+2019>s [[Theatre Royal, Nottingham|Theatre Royal]] and was not a success.  However, with a rewritten last act, it opened at the [[No<U+00EB>l Coward Theatre|New Theatre]] in London in January 1905. The premier of the London production was enthusiastically received by the audience, running 122 performances and enjoying numerous revivals. ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' became a favourite of London audiences, playing more than 2,000 performances and becoming one of the most popular shows staged in England to that date. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her "reckless daredevil" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|musical]] and other media. 

[[John Buchan]] (1875-1940) published the [[adventure novel]] ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' in 1915. 

The novelist [[Georgette Heyer]] created the [[historical romance]] genre.

[[File:Tolkien 1916.jpg|upright|thumb|[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]]]  
The [[Kailyard school]] of Scottish writers, notably [[J. M. Barrie]] (1869-1937), creator of ''[[Peter Pan]]'' (1904), presented an idealised version of society and brought of fantasy and folklore back into fashion. In 1908, [[Kenneth Grahame]] (1859-1932) wrote the children's classic ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. An informal [[literary]] discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "[[Inklings]]". Its leading members were the major [[high fantasy|fantasy]] novelists; [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Lewis is especially known for ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Another significant writer is [[Alan Garner]] author of  ''Elidor'' (1965), while [[Terry Pratchett]] is a more recent fantasy writer. [[Roald Dahl]] rose to prominence with his children's [[fantasy novels]], such as  ''James and the Giant Peach'' and ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'', often inspired by experiences from his childhood, which are notable for their often unexpected endings, and unsentimental, dark humour. [[J. K. Rowling]]  author of the highly successful ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series and [[Philip Pullman]] famous for his ''His Dark Materials'' trilogy are other significant authors of [[fantasy novels]] for younger readers.

Noted writers in the field of [[comic book]]s are [[Neil Gaiman]], and [[Alan Moore]]; Gaiman also produces [[graphic novel]]s.

In the later decades of the 20th-century, the genre of [[science fiction]] begun to be taken more seriously because of the work of writers such as  [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s (''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''), [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Ursula le Guin]], [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]. Another prominent writer in this genre, [[Douglas Adams]], is particularly associated with the comic science fiction work, ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe'', which began life as a radio series in 1978. Mainstream novelists such [[Doris Lessing]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] also wrote works in this genre, while Scottish novelist [[Ian M. Banks]] has also achieved a reputation as both a writer of traditional and science fiction novels.
