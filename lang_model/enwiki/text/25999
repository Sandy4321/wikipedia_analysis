The '''A4400''' (or '''Inner Ring Road''' or '''[[Queensway (Birmingham)|Queensway]]''') was a main road in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] that previously formed a ring around the city centre. Junctions on the road were largely [[grade separated]], with pedestrians kept physically separate from vehicular traffic and most junctions allowing vehicles staying on the road to pass over or under those using the junction. It is now widely regarded as one of the classic [[urban planning]] blunders of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/news/west-midlands-news/2008/08/07/council-blunder-reveals-paradise-circus-secret-65233-21489881/|title=Council blunder reveals Paradise Circus secret|publisher=[[Birmingham Post]]|accessdate=25 January 2010|first=Paul|last=Dale|date= 7 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/jun/29/architecture.regeneration|title=It's all change in the second city... again|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=25 January 2010 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Bayley | date=29 June 2008}}</ref>

Although seen as a revolutionary improvement when the first section opened in 1960, the 'Concrete Collar', as it became known, was viewed by council planners as an impenetrable barrier for the expansion of the city centre. In particular, it became unpopular with pedestrians{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, who were required to use [[subway (underpass)|subway]]s at the [[roundabout]]s, an unpopular route{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} due to fear of crime{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}. However, some users cite the efficiency of [[Grade separation|grade separated]] design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk/comment/|title=Birmingham Big City Plan Comments|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref>

Since 1988, the city council has sought to recreate links between the city centre and the neighbouring areas, enlarging the city centre and improving the pedestrian environment across the city, with an emphasis on shifting vehicular movements out to the [[A4540 road|Middle Ring Road]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbandesigncompendium.co.uk/birminghaminnerringroad Restructuring Birmingham's Inner Ring Road System|title=Restructuring Birmingham's Inner Ring Road |publisher= Urban Design Compendium |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>  Controversially,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consult.birmingham.gov.uk/commonService/consult/viewRepresentation?id=454982&pdf&output:where=portal|title=Birmingham Big City Plan Leaflet Consultation|publisher=Birmingham City Council|accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref> pedestrian crossings are replacing underpasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gifford.uk.com/sectors-and-projects/transport-interchanges/project/masshouse-circus-redevelopment-birmingham/|title=Masshouse Circus Redevelopment, Birmingham|publisher=Gifford, part of Ramboll UK Ltd.|accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref>

==History==
It was first planned by [[Herbert Manzoni]] in the 1943 and an [[Act of Parliament]] permitting construction was passed in 1946. Due to financial controls, the first part of the ring road, Smallbrook Queensway, did not begin construction until 1957 and was completed in 1960. The entire ring road was opened by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1971.

However, since the 1990s, some of Queensway has been altered in order to reverse the earlier strict separation of road and pedestrian traffic with a view to providing a more attractive environment for pedestrians, deter through traffic, and reducing the severance effects of the Inner Ring Road. A number of the altered junctions are in [[redevelopment of Birmingham|regeneration areas]], such as [[Masshouse]]. In early 2008, the St Chads Queensway area near the [[St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St. Chad's Cathedral]] was modified to remove pedestrian underpasses and bring all pedestrian and car traffic back on to the traditional street level.

The road previously consisted on the following roads (anticlockwise from [[A38(M) motorway|A38(M)]] approach (Aston Expressway):
* [[St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham|St Chads]] Queensway (now A38)
* Lancaster Street Queensway
* St Chads Circus Queensway
* Paradise Circus Queensway, below [[Birmingham Central Library]]
* Great Charles Queensway (now A38)
* Suffolk Street Queensway (now A38)
* Holloway Circus Queensway (now A38)
* [[Smalbroke family|Smallbrook]] Queensway (unclassified)
* St Martin's Queenway (demolished to make way for new [[Bull Ring, Birmingham|Bullring]] development)
* Moor Street Queensway (unclassified) rebuilt into "Bus mall" renamed Moor Street Ringway
* [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]] Queensway (unclassified)
* [[Masshouse|Masshouse Circus Queensway]], formerly roundabout over James Watt Queensway (demolished)
