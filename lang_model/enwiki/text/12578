'''Gordon''' or '''Peter''' was a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] on a [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]]<ref>http://historylink101.com/bw/American_Image/slides/4-j-IMG_1583.html</ref> who made his escape from bondage in March 1863.

==Escape==
Gordon escaped from the 3,000 acre plantation of John & Bridget Lyons, who owned nearly forty slaves at the time of the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]].<ref name="Abruzzo 2011" /> The Lyons plantation was located along the right bank of the [[Atchafalaya River]] between [[Melville, Louisiana|Melville]] and [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lyons Shaw|first1=Adonica|title=Captain John lyons of st landry parish|url=http://shawra.com/gen/index_files/Page1884.htm}}</ref> In order to foil the scent of the [[bloodhound]]s who were chasing him, Gordon took onions from his plantation, which he carried in his pockets. After crossing each creek or swamp, he rubbed his body freely with these onions in order to throw the dogs off his scent. He fled over {{convert|40|mi}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil War CDV of African American Contraband, Baton Rouge, La.|url=http://www.cowanauctions.com/auctions/item.aspx?ItemId=66246|website=Cowan's Auctions|accessdate=22 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022160837/http://www.cowanauctions.com/auctions/item.aspx?ItemId=66246|archivedate=22 October 2014|quote=Civil War CDV of African American Contraband, Baton Rouge, La., 2008, Historic Americana Auction, Dec 4 & 5 with imprint of McPherson & Oliver, Baton Rouge, and verso inked inscription Contraband that marched 40 miles to get to our lines.

==Arrival at Union Camp==
Upon arrival at the Union camp, Gordon underwent a medical examination on April 2, 1863 which revealed severe [[Keloid|keloid scars]] from several [[Flagellation|whippings]]. Itinerant photographers William D. McPherson and his partner Mr. Oliver, who were in camp at the time, produced carte de visite portraits of Gordon.

During the examination, Gordon is quoted as saying "Ten days from to-day I left the plantation. Overseer Artayou Carrier whipped me. I was two months in bed sore from the whipping. My master come after I was whipped; he discharged the overseer."<ref>Scars of Slavery, National Archives.</ref>   My master was not present.  I don't remember the whipping.  I was two months in bed sore from the whipping and my sense began to come - I was sort of crazy.  I tried to shoot everybody.  They said so, I did not know.  I did not know that I had attempted to shoot everyone; they told me so.  I burned up all my clothes; but I don't remember that.  I never was this way (crazy) before.  I don't know what make me come that way (crazy).  My master come after I was whipped; saw me in bed; he discharged the overseer.  They told me I attempted to shoot my wife the first one; I did not shoot any one; I did not harm any one.  My master's Capt.

==Colored Troops==
Gordon served the Union troops as a guide, and on one expedition was taken prisoner by the [[Confederate States of America|rebels]], who, infuriated beyond measure, tied him up and beat him, leaving him for dead. He survived, however, and once more made his escape to Union lines. Gordon soon afterwards enlisted in a [[United States Colored Troops|Colored Troops]] [[American Civil War|Civil War]] unit in the [[XIX Corps (Union Army)|XIX Corps]].  He was said to have fought bravely as a [[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] in the [[2nd Louisiana Regiment Infantry (Union)|2nd Louisiana Regiment Infantry]] during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] in May 1863,<ref>{{cite news|title=A Picture for the Tims|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/1164673/sergeant_gordon_of_the_second_louisiana/?|accessdate=16 October 2014|work=The Liberator|date=3 July 1863|location=Boston|page=3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref> the first time that African-American soldiers played a leading role in an assault.<ref>Shumard, Civil War Trust.</ref>

''[[The Atlantic]]'''s editor-in-chief [[James Bennet]] noted "Part of the incredible power of this image I think is the dignity of that man. He's posing. His expression is almost indifferent. I just find that remarkable. He's basically saying, 'This is a fact.'"<ref>Norris 2011, NPR.</ref>

|quote   = There has lately come to us, from Baton Rouge, the photograph of a former slave--now, thanks to the Union army, a freeman.  It represents him in a sitting posture, his stalwart body bared to the waist, his fine head and intelligent face in profile, his left arm bent, resting upon his hip, and his naked back exposed to full fiew.  Upon that back, horrible to contemplate! is a testimony against slavery more eloquent than any words.  Scarred, gouged, gathered in great ridges, knotted, furrowed, the poor tortured flesh stands out a hideos record of the slave-driver's lash.  Months have elapsed since the martyrdom was undergone, and the wounds have healed, but as long as the flesh lasts will this fearful impress remain.  It is a touching picture, an appeal so mute and powerful that none but hardened natures can look upon it unmoved.  However much men may depict false images, the sun will not lie.  From such evidence as this there is no escape, and to see is to believe.  Many, therefore, desired a copy of the photograph, and from the original numerous copies have been taken.

The surgeon of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|First Louisiana regiment, (colored,)]] writing to his brother in the city, encloses this photograph, with these words: -

"I send you the picture of a slave as he appears after a whipping.  I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, ''hundreds of such sights''--so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you.  If you know of any one who talk abut the ''humane manner'' in which the slaves are treated, please show them this picture.  It is a lecture in itself."

<br>{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width = 75% |align=center
|quote  = We received from Baton Rouge the photographic likeness of a slave's naked back, lacerated by the whip [...]  We look on the picture with amazement that cannot find words for utterance.  Amazement at the cruelty which could perpetrate such an outrage as this ; at the brutal folly, the stupid ignorance, that could permit such a piece of infatuation ; at the absence not only of humane feeling, but of economical prudence of common sense, of ordinary intelligence, displayed in such frantic thoughtlessness.  Among what sort of people are such things possible? [...] This card-photograph should be multiplied by the hundred thousand, and scattered over the states.  It tells the story in a way that even [[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]] cannot approach ; because it tells the story to the eye.  If seeing is believing -- and it is in the immense majority of cases -- seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!
