'''Ana Lucia Cortez''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', played by [[Michelle Rodriguez]]. Ana Lucia made her first appearance as a guest star in the [[Exodus (Lost)|first season finale]], and became part of the main cast for [[Lost (season 2)|season two]]. After Oceanic Flight 815 splits in mid-air, the tail section and fuselage crash on opposite sides of a mysterious island. Ana Lucia becomes the leader of the tail section. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] in her two centric episodes, "[[Collision (Lost)|Collision]]" and "[[Two for the Road (Lost)|Two for the Road]]", show her life as a police officer before the crash.

Rodriguez evoked controversy after being stopped by the police for [[driving under the influence]] a few weeks before her character was killed, leading to speculation that this was the reason for her character's death. The producers of ''Lost'' stated that Rodriguez was only interested in appearing for one season, so Ana Lucia's death was written in from the beginning. Ana Lucia is shot and killed by [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael Dawson]].

[[Image:Rodriguez crop.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rodriguez was only interested in appearing in ''Lost'' for 1 year.]]
In February 2005, ''Lost'' producers began looking for a [[Latina]] woman in her mid-thirties who would be the leader of the tail section, and a romantic interest for Jack.<ref name="ausiello"/> Michelle Rodriguez's agent called the producers, informing them Rodriguez was interested in the role, but only for a year.<ref name="ausiello"/> Rodriguez, producers [[Damon Lindelof]] and [[Carlton Cuse]], and ''Lost'' creator [[J. J. Abrams]] met, and Rodriguez explained she would only be interested in one season because she was a "nomadic spirit", but would like to do one "kickass" arc.<ref name="ausiello">Ausiello, Michael, (May 3, 2006) "[http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Did-Lost-Kill/700001362 Why Did Lost Kill Ana Lucia?
