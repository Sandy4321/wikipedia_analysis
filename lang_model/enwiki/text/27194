'''HMS ''Havock'' (H43)''' was an [[G and H class destroyer|H-class]] [[destroyer]] built for the British [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1930s. During the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936<U+2013>1939, the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. During the first few months of [[World War II]], ''Havock'' searched for German [[commerce raider]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and participated in the [[First Battle of Narvik]] during the [[Norwegian Campaign]] of April<U+2013>June 1940 before she was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of [[Malta Convoys|convoys to Malta]]. The ship took part in the  [[Battle of Cape Spada]] in July 1940, the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in March 1941 and the evacuation of [[Greece]] in April 1941. She was damaged during the Battle of Crete the following month, but participated in the [[Syria<U+2013>Lebanon Campaign]] in June. 

''Havock'' began escorting supply convoys in June to [[Tobruk]], [[Libya]] until the ship was damaged in October. She was repaired in time to escort a convoy to Malta during the [[First Battle of Sirte]] in December and was badly damaged whilst protecting another convoy during the [[Second Battle of Sirte]] in March 1942. Repairs were attempted in [[Malta]], but the ship was further damaged in an air raid in early April. The Admiralty decided that further attempts to repair her at Malta were pointless and ordered her to [[Gibraltar]] for permanent repairs. Whilst on passage to Gibraltar on 6 April, ''Havock'' ran aground near [[Cape Bon]], [[Tunisia]] and her crew was interned by the [[Vichy French]]. 

==Description and construction==
''Havock'' displaced {{convert|1350|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1883|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|323|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|5|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|34000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Havock'' carried a maximum of {{convert|470|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5530|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime,<ref name=w78>Whitley, p. 109</ref> but this increased to 146 in wartime.<ref>English, pp. 89, 102</ref>

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Havock'' had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|0.5&nbsp;inch Vickers Mk III]] [[machine gun]]. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch]] torpedoes.<ref name=w78/> One [[depth charge]] rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.<ref>English, p. 141</ref> By mid-1940, this had increased to 44 depth charges.<ref>Friedman, p. 235</ref>

Ordered on 13 December 1934 from [[William Denny & Brothers]], ''Havock'' was [[Keel|laid down]] at their shipyard at [[Dumbarton]], [[Scotland]] on 15 May 1935. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 July 1936 and completed on 16 January 1937. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost <U+00A3>248,470.<ref>English, pp. 102<U+2013>03</ref> 

===Wartime modifications===
Most ships of ''Havock''{{'}}s class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a [[QF 12 pounder 12 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] AA gun after the [[evacuation of Dunkirk]] in 1940, but it is not clear if she received this modification. Other changes may have included exchanging her two quadruple .50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her [[searchlight]] platform and another pair on the wings of the ship's [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]].<ref>Lenton, pp. 160<U+2013>61</ref>

==Service==
''Havock'' was assigned to the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. She patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the [[Non-Intervention Committee]]. On the night of 31 August/1 September 1937, she was unsuccessfully attacked by the {{ship|Italian submarine|Iride}} with torpedoes, between the [[Gulf of Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]. The ship was refitted in [[Gibraltar]] between 19 October and 13 November and required repairs between 16 April and 6 May 1938 after hitting the stone side of a [[quay]]. ''Havock'' was given a brief refit at [[Sheerness|Sheerness Dockyard]] between 15 and 26 August 1939 before returning to Gibraltar.<ref name=e5>English, p. 105</ref>

The ship sailed to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]] on 30 August and arrived on 4 September to search for German commerce raiders. She was transferred back to the UK in November for a more thorough refit at Sheerness between 18 December and 23 March 1940. In the meantime, the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla had been assigned to the Home Fleet and ''Havock'' rejoined them when her refit was finished.<ref name=e5/> On 6 April ''Havock'' and the rest of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla escorted the four destroyer [[minelayer]]s of the 20th Destroyer Flotilla as they sailed to implement [[Operation Wilfred]], an operation to lay [[Naval mine|mines]] in the [[Vestfjord]] to prevent the transport of Swedish [[iron ore]] from [[Narvik]] to Germany. The mines were laid on the early morning of 8 April, before the Germans began their invasion, and the destroyers joined the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} and her escorts.<ref>Haarr, p. 65, 308, 337</ref>

During the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April 1940, ''Havock'' and four other H-class ships of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla attacked the [[Kriegsmarine|German]] destroyers that had transported [[Heer (1935-1945)|German]] troops to occupy [[Narvik]] in northern [[Norway]] the previous day. The [[flotilla leader]] {{HMS|Hardy|1936|2}} led four of her [[sister ship|half-sisters]] down [[Ofotfjord]] in a surprise dawn attack on Narvik harbour during a blinding snowstorm. {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|2}} and {{HMS|Hostile|H55|2}} were initially left at the entrance, but ''Havock'' was third into the harbour and fired five of her torpedoes into the mass of shipping. One torpedo hit {{ship|German destroyer|Z22 Anton Schmitt||2}} in the stern. In addition, the ship hit {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L<U+00FC>demann||2}} twice with {{convert|4.7|in|adj=on}} shells. As the British ships were withdrawing, they encountered five German destroyers at close range. Two of the German ships [[Crossing the T|crossed the T]] of the British ships and quickly set ''Hardy'' on fire and forced her to run aground. ''Havock'' was next in line and fired torpedos at the German destroyers, but they all missed. She was hit in return, but not significantly damaged. In the confusion and limited visibility, ''Havock'' pulled out of the line to find out what happened to ''Hardy'' and to protect the rear of the British formation from the other three German destroyers in pursuit, but then had to then to turn again to allow her rear guns to fire when her forward guns failed. ''Havock'' and ''Hostile'' turned back to protect their badly damaged sister, ''Hotspur'', and all three continued to withdraw down the Ofotfjord. En route, they encountered the German supply ship Rauenfels, loaded with artillery and ammunition, whose crew ran her aground and abandoned ship after ''Hostile'' fired at the ship. A boarding party from ''Havock'' found the ship on fire and she blew up after the ship fired two shells into her.<ref>Haarr, pp. 340<U+2013>48</ref> The ship remained in Norwegian waters until May, when she escorted the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} on an unsuccessful sweep of the [[North Sea]] looking for German ships, early in the month.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 21, 23</ref>

''Havock'' was assigned to the [[Nore Command]] shortly afterwards and bombarded German troops occupying [[Waalhaven]] Airfield on 10 May together with her sister {{HMS|Hyperion|H97|2}}. She rescued suvivors from the sunken ferry Prinses Juliana off the Dutch coast and returned them to the Hook of Holland where she recovered a number of British demolition parties. On 16 May, the ship ordered to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet at Malta and was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July, the ship escorted the Australian [[light cruiser]] {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|2}} and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the {{ship|Italian cruiser|Bartolomeo Colleoni}} together with the other escorting destroyers. Her boiler room was flooded after an attack by Italian aircraft after this battle and she was repaired at [[Suez]] from 29 July to 15 September. ''Havock'' and her sister {{HMS|Hasty|H24|2}} surprised the {{ship|Italian submarine|Berillo}} on the surface on 2 October off the coast of Egypt and forced her to scuttle herself.<ref name=e14>English, pp. 104<U+2013>06</ref> The destroyers rescued 47 survivors between them.<ref name=e14/>

''Havock'' was engaged on escort duties for the next six months, including escorting the carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} during the [[Battle of Taranto]] on the night of 11/12 November,<ref>Rohwer, p. 52</ref> aside from a refit in Malta from 22 December to 20 February 1941.<ref name=e6>English, p. 106</ref> During the Battle of Cape Matapan, she torpedoed and sank the {{ship|Italian destroyer|Alfieri}} on 28 March.<ref>O'Hara, pp. 96<U+2013>97</ref> The ship [[Battle_of_Greece#Evacuation_of_Commonwealth_forces|evacuated Commonwealth troops from Greece]] at the end of April and was one of three destroyers escorting the light cruiser {{HMS|Ajax|22|2}} when they bombarded [[Benghazi]] on the night of 7/8 May.<ref>UK, Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 82, 98</ref> ''Havock'' was damaged by dive bombers on 23 May, killing 15 and wounding 10 men<ref>Shores, Cull and Malizi, p. 409</ref>, after a patrol off [[Heraklion]], [[Crete]]. She was under repair at Alexandria until 16 June.<ref name=e6/> The ship bombarded Vichy French positions in [[Lebanon]] in early July<ref>Rohwer, p. 78</ref> and then began escorting ships to Tobruk until October when her propeller shafts and propellers were damaged. ''Havock'' was under repair from 21 October to 4 December at Alexandria.<ref name=e6/>

In mid-December, the ship escorted the supply ship {{MV|Breconshire||2}} to Malta during the First Battle of Sirte and then joined [[Force K]] in an attempt to intercept an Italian convoy to [[Tripoli, Libya]]. On the night of 18/19 December, the reinforced Force K ran over an Italian minefield that sank one cruiser and damaged two others. ''Havock'' escorted the badly damaged light cruiser {{HMS|Aurora|12|2}} back to Malta.<ref>UK, Admiralty Historical Section, pp. 220<U+2013>24</ref> ''Havock'' was one of four destroyers that escorted ''Breconshire'' back to Alexandria in early January 1942.<ref name=e6/> Whilst escorting another convoy to Malta, the ship was diverted to escort the damaged freighter ''Thermoplylae'' from Benghazi back to Alexandria, but the latter was attacked and sunk by Axis aircraft en route on 19 January. ''Havock'' rescued some 350 survivors before ''Thermoplylae'' sank.<ref>Rohwer, p. 136</ref> The ship was transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in February and continued to escort convoys to Malta.<ref name=e6/> On 22 March 1942, a splinter from a near miss by the {{ship|Italian battleship|Littorio}} perforated one of her boilers during the Second Battle of Sirte, and ''Havock'' was forced to make for Malta for repairs.<ref>O'Hara, p. 166</ref> Whilst in dock, the ship had become a major target for Axis aircraft and sustained some damage on 3 April, so she was ordered to Gibraltar before her repairs were complete. ''Havock'' ran aground off [[Kelibia]], Tunisia, in the [[Strait of Sicily]] on 6 April and was wrecked. One crewman was killed in the incident. Her crew and passengers were interned by the Vichy French and were released after [[Operation Torch]].<ref name=e6/> Her wreck was later torpedoed by the {{ship|Italian submarine|Aradam}}.<ref>Rohwer, p. 157</ref>
