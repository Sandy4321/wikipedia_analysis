The [[Hoysala Empire]] (1025&ndash;1343), in what is now southern India, produced a large body of literature in the [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] languages.<ref name="ascendent">Kamath (2001), p. 132</ref> The empire was established by [[Nripa Kama II]], came into political prominence during the rule of King [[Vishnuvardhana]] (1108&ndash;1152),<ref name="ruling"/> and declined gradually after its defeat by the [[Khilji dynasty]] invaders in 1311.<ref name="plunder">Kamath (2001), p. 129</ref> 

[[Kannada literature]] during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the [[Jain]] and [[Veerashaiva]] faiths, and to a lesser extent that of the [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] faith. The earliest well-known [[brahmin]] writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court.<ref name="brahminwrite">Kamath (2001), pp. 133&ndash;134</ref> While most of the courtly textual production was in Kannada,<ref name="extent">Pollock (2006), pp. 288&ndash;289</ref> an important corpus of [[monastery|monastic]] [[Vaishnava]] literature relating to ''[[Dvaita]]'' (dualistic) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher [[Madhvacharya]] in Sanskrit.<ref name="matha">Kamath (2001), p. 155</ref> 

Writing Kannada literature in native [[Meter (poetry)|metres]] was first popularised by the court poets. These metres were the ''sangatya'', compositions sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument; ''shatpadi'', six-line verses; ''ragale'', lyrical compositions in blank verse; and ''[[tripadi]]'', three-line verses.<ref name="use-native-metre">Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), pp. 164, 203; Rice E.

{{Kannada poets in Hoysala Empire}}
Beginning with the 12th&nbsp;century, important socio-political changes took place in the [[Deccan]], south of the [[Krishna river]]. During this period, the Hoysalas, native [[Kannadiga]]s from the [[Malnad]] region (hill country in modern Karnataka) were on the ascendant as a political power.<ref name="karorg">Quote:"A purely Karnataka dynasty" (Moraes 1931, p. 10)</ref><ref name="rice">Rice, B.

P. (1921), p. 59</ref><ref name="nativemetre2">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1181</ref> 

As in earlier centuries, Jain authors wrote about [[tirthankar]]s (saints), princes and other personages important to the Jain religion. Jain versions of the Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] and [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]] (tales of Hindu god Krishna) were also written.<ref name="kesiraja"/><ref name="naga1">Sastri (1955), p. 357</ref> According to R. Narasimhacharya, a noted scholar on Kannada literature, more Jain writers wrote in Kannada than in any other Dravidian language during the "Augustan age" of Kannada literature, from the earliest known works to the 12th&nbsp;century.<ref name="augustan">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 61, 65</ref> The Veerashaiva writers, devotees of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Shiva]], wrote about his 25 forms in their [[Expository preaching|expositions]] of [[Shaivism]]. Vaishnava authors wrote treatments of the Hindu epics, the Ramayana, the [[Mahabharata]] and the Bhagavata.<ref name="trad">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 61</ref> Breaking away from the old Jain tradition of using the ''champu'' metre for writing Kannada literature, [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] penned poems in the ''ragale'' metre in ''Siva-ganada-ragalegalu'' (1160). His nephew Raghavanka established the ''shatpadi'' tradition by writing a unique version of the story of King [[Harishchandra]] in ''Harishchandra Kavya'' (1200). Sisumayana introduced the ''sangatya'' metre in his ''Anjanacharita'' and ''Tripuradahana'' (1235).<ref name="harish">Sastri (1955), pp. 359, 362</ref><ref name="ragale">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 205</ref> However, some scholars continued to employ Sanskritic metres such as ''champu'' (''Ramachandra Charitapurana''),<ref name="sins"/> ''shataka'' (100-line verses, ''Pampa sataka'')<ref name="comp"/> and ''ashtaka'' (eight-line verses, ''Mudige ashtaka'').<ref name="mudige"/>

The exact beginnings of the [[haridasa]] movement in the Kannada-speaking region have been disputed. Belur Keshavadasa, a noted ''[[Harikatha]]'' scholar, claimed in his book ''Karnataka Bhaktavijaya'' that the movement was inspired by saint Achalananda Dasa of Turvekere (in the modern [[Tumkur district]]) in the 9th&nbsp;century.<ref name="achala">Belur Keshavadasa in the book ''Karnataka Bhaktavijaya'' (Sahitya Akademi 1987, p. 881)</ref> However, neither the language used in Achalananda Dasa's  compositions nor the discovery of a composition with the pen name "Achalanada Vitthala", which mentions the 13th-century philosopher Madhvacharya, lends support to the 9th-century theory. [[Naraharitirtha]] (1281), one of earliest disciples of Madhvacharya, is therefore considered the earliest haridasa to write Vaishnava compositions in Kannada.<ref name="discover">Sahitya Akademi 1987, p. 881</ref> Secular topics were popular and included treatises on poetry (''Sringararatnakara'') and writings on natural sciences (''Rattasutra''), mathematics (''Vyavaharaganita''), fiction (''Lilavati''), grammar (''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]''), rhetoric (''Udayadityalankara'') and others.<ref name="champu"/><ref name="sec"/><ref name="kesiraja"/><ref name="flavor"/>

Important contributions were made by some prominent literary families. One Jain family produced several authors, including Mallikarjuna, the noted anthologist (1245); his brother-in-law Janna (1209), the court poet of King [[Veera Ballala II]]; Mallikarjuna's son [[Keshiraja]] (1260), considered by D. R. Nagaraj, a scholar on literary cultures in history, to be the greatest theorist of Kannada grammar; and Sumanobana, who was in the court of King [[Narasimha I]] and was the maternal grandfather of Keshiraja.<ref name="theorist">Nagaraj (2003), p. 364</ref><ref name="kataka"/> Harihara (1160) and his nephew Raghavanka (1200), poets who set the trend for using native metres, came from a Shaiva family (devotees of the god Shiva).<ref name="theorist"/> 

The support of the Hoysala rulers for the Kannada language was strong, and this is seen even in their [[Epigraphy|epigraph]]s, often written in polished and poetic language, rather than prose, with illustrations of floral designs in the margins.<ref name="floral">Ayyar (2006), p. 600</ref> In addition to the Hoysala patronage, royal support was enjoyed by Kannada poets and writers during this period in the courts of neighbouring kingdoms of the western [[Deccan]]. The Western Chalukyas, the southern [[Kalachuri]]s, the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri]] and the [[Shilaharas of Southern Maharashtra|Silharas]] of [[Kolhapur]] are some of the ruling families who enthusiastically used Kannada in inscriptions and promoted its literature.<ref name="floral"/><ref name="hoy1">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 68</ref><ref name="hoy2">Kamath (2001) p. 143, pp. 114&ndash;115</ref><ref name="humble">Masica (1991), pp. 45&ndash;46</ref>

Writers bilingual in Kannada and [[Telugu]] gained popularity which caused interaction between the two languages, a trend that continued into modern times. The Veerashiva canon of the Kannada language was translated or adapted into Telugu from this time period.<ref name="timeperiod">Velchuru Narayana Rao in Pollock (2003), pp. 383&ndash;384</ref> Palkuriki Somanatha (1195), a devotee of social reformer [[Basavanna]], is the most well-known of these bilingual poets. The Chola chieftain Nannechoda (c.&nbsp;1150) used many Kannada words in his Telugu writings.<ref name="biling">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 27&ndash;28</ref> After the decline of the Hoysala empire, the [[Vijayanagara empire]] kings further supported writers in both languages. In 1369, inspired by Palkuriki Somanatha, Bhima Kavi translated the Telugu ''Basavapurana'' to Kannada,<ref name="bhima">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1182</ref> and King [[Deva Raya II]] (c.&nbsp;1425) had [[Chamarasa]]'s landmark writing ''Prabhulingalile'' translated into Telugu and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].<ref name="tamil">Shahitya Akademi (1987), p. 612</ref> Many Veerashaiva writers in the court of the 17th century [[Kingdom of Mysore]] were multilingual in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit while the [[Srivaishnava]] (a sect of Vaishnavism) Kannada writers of the court were in competition with the Telugu and Sanskrit writers.<ref name="legacy">Nagaraj (2003), pp. 377&ndash;379</ref> 
  
Information regarding several writers from this period whose works are considered lost are available from contemporary records. They include Maghanandi (probable author of ''Rama Kathe'' and guru of Kamalabhava of 1235), Balachandra (guru of Nagachandra of 1105), Nachi Raja (''Nachiraji'', a commentary on the ''Amara Khosha'', 1158), Srutakirti (guru of Aggala of 1189 and author of ''Raghava Pandaviya'' and possibly a ''Jina-stuti''), Sambha Varma (mentioned by Nagavarma of 1145),<ref name="sambha">Rice Lewis (1985), p. xx</ref> Vira Nandi (''Chandraprabha Kavyamala''),<ref name="viranandi">Rice Lewis (1985), p. xxi</ref> Dharani Pandita (''Bijjala raya Charita'' and ''Varangana Charita''),<ref name="dharni">Rice Lewis (1985), p. xxiii</ref> Amrita Nandi (''Dhanvantari Nighantu''), Vidyanatha (''Prataparudriya''), Ganeshvara (''Sahitya Sanjivana''),<ref name="nandi">Rice Lewis (1985), xxiv</ref> Harabhakta, a Veerashaiva mendicant (''Vedabhashya'', 1300), and Siva Kavi (author of ''Basava Purana'' in 1330).<ref name="siva">Rice Lewis (1985), xxvi</ref>

===Jain epics===

During the early 12th-century ascendancy of the Hoysalas, the kings of the dynasty entertained imperial ambitions.<ref name="imperial">Keay (2000), p. 252</ref> King Vishnuvardhana wanted to perform [[Veda|Vedic]] sacrifices befitting an emperor, and surpass his overlords, the Western Chalukyas, in military and architectural achievements. This led to his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. Around the same time, the well-known philosopher [[Ramanujacharya]] sought refuge from the Cholas in Hoysala territory and popularised the [[Sri Vaishnava]] faith, a sect of Vaishnavism. Although Jains continued to dominate culturally in what is now the southern Karnataka region for a while, these social changes would later contribute to the decline of Jain literary output.<ref name="ascendent"/><ref name="decline">Rice Lewis (1985), pp. xxiv-xxv</ref> The growing political clout of the Hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court, who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons.<ref name="panegyrics">Keay 2000, p. 251</ref> 

Nagachandra, a scholar and the builder of the Mallinatha Jinalaya (a Jain temple in honor of the 19th&nbsp;Jain [[tirthankar]], Mallinatha, in [[Bijapur, Karnataka]]), wrote ''Mallinathapurana'' (1105), an account of the evolution of the soul of the Jain saint. According to some historians, King [[Veera Ballala I]] was his patron.<ref name="ramachandra">Kamath (2001), p. 133</ref> Later, he wrote his ''magnum opus'', a Jain version of the Hindu epic [[Ramayana]] called ''Ramachandra Charitapurana'' (or ''Pampa Ramayana''). Written in the traditional ''champu'' metre and in the ''Pauma charia'' tradition of Vimalasuri, it is the earliest extant version of the epic in the Kannada language.<ref name="sins"/> The work contains 16&nbsp;sections and deviates significantly from the original epic by [[Valmiki]]. Nagachandra represents King [[Ravana]], the villain of the Hindu epic, as a tragic hero, who in a moment of weakness commits the sin of abducting [[Sita]] (wife of the Hindu god Rama) but is eventually purified by her devotion to [[Rama]]. In a further deviation, Rama's loyal brother [[Lakshmana]] (instead of Rama) kills Ravana in the final battle.<ref name="sins">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1180</ref> Eventually, Rama takes ''jainadiksha'' (converts to Jainism), becomes an ascetic and attains ''[[nirvana]]'' (enlightenment). Considered a complementary work to the ''Pampa Bharatha'' of [[Adikavi Pampa]] (941, a Jain version of the epic Mahabharata), the work earned Nagachandra the honorific "Abhinava Pampa" ("new Pampa").<ref name="nirvana">Sastri (1955), pp. 357&ndash;358</ref> Only in the Kannada language do Jain versions exist of the Hindu epics, the [[Mahabharata]] and Ramayana, in addition to their brahminical version.<ref name="rama">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 66</ref>

Kanti (1108), known for her wit and humour, was one of the earliest female poets of the Kannada language and a contemporary of Nagachandra, with whom she indulged in debates and repartees.<ref name="wit">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1603</ref> Rajaditya, a native of either Puvinabage or Raibhag (the modern [[Belgaum district]]), was in the Hoysala court during the days of King Veera Ballala&nbsp;I and King Vishnuvardhana.<ref name="ramachandra"/><ref name="ganita">Rice E. P. (1921), p. 36</ref> He wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical topics and is credited with three of the earliest writings on mathematics in the Kannada language: ''Vyavaharaganita'', ''Kshetraganita'' and ''Lilavati''.<ref name="champu"/> Udayaditya, a Chola prince, authored a piece on rhetoric called ''Udayadityalankara'' (1150). It was based on Dandin's Sanskrit ''Kavyadarsa''.<ref name="champu"/>

===Age of Harihara===

[[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] (or Harisvara, 1160), who came from a family of ''karnikas'' (accountants) in [[Hampi]], was one of the earliest Veerashaiva writers who was not part of the ''Vachana'' poetic tradition. He is considered one of the most influential Kannada poets of the Hoysala era. A non-traditionalist, he has been called "poet of poets" and a "poet for the masses". Kannada poetry changed course because of his efforts, and he was an inspiration for generations of poets to follow.<ref name="influence">Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 191</ref><ref name="generation">Sahitya Akademi (1988), pp. 1411&ndash;1412, p. 1550</ref> Impressed by his early writings, Kereya Padmarasa, the court poet of King [[Narasimha I]], introduced him to the king, who became Harihara's patron.<ref name="introduce">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1548</ref> A master of many metres, he authored the ''Girijakalyana'' ("Marriage of the mountain born goddess &ndash; Parvati") in the [[Kalidasa]] tradition, employing the ''champu'' style to tell a 10-part story leading to the marriage of the god [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].<ref name="Parvati">Sastri (1955), pp. 361&ndash;362</ref><ref name="Parvati1">Narasimhacharya, (1988), p. 20</ref> According to an anecdote, Harihara was so against eulogising earthly mortals that he struck his protege Raghavanka for writing about King Harishchandra in the landmark work ''Harishchandra Kavya'' (c.&nbsp;1200).<ref name="eulogising">Nagara (2003), p. 364</ref> Harihara is credited with developing the native ''ragale'' metre.<ref name="develop">Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 551&ndash;552</ref> The earliest poetic biographer in the Kannada language, he wrote a biography of Basavanna called ''Basavarajadevara ragale'', which gives interesting details about the protagonist while not always conforming to popular beliefs of the time.<ref name="bio">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 179</ref><ref name="belief">Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 403&ndash;404</ref> Ascribed to him is a group of 100&nbsp;poems called the ''Nambiyanana ragale'' (also called ''Shivaganada ragale'' or ''Saranacharitamanasa'' &ndash; "The holy lake of the lives of the devotees") after the saint Nambiyana.<ref name="nambiyana">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 205</ref><ref name="nambiyana1">Sastri (1955), pp. 361&ndash;362</ref><ref name="nambiyana2">Rice E.

Famous among Vaishnava writers and the first brahmin writer (of the [[Smartha]] sect) of repute, [[Rudrabhatta]] wrote ''Jagannatha Vijaya'' (1180) in a style considered a transition between ancient and medieval Kannada.<ref name="transition">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 203</ref> Chandramouli, a minister in the court of King Veera Ballala&nbsp;II, was his patron. The writing, in ''champu'' metre, is about the life of the god [[Krishna]]. Leading to the god's fight with Banasura, it is based on an earlier writing, ''[[Vishnu Purana|Vishnupurana]]''.<ref name="bana">Sastri (1955) p.  364</ref> 

Nemichandra, court poet of King Veera Ballala&nbsp;II and the Silhara King Lakshmana of [[Kholapur]], wrote ''Lilavati Prabandham'' (1170), the earliest available true fiction (and hence a novel) in Kannada, with an erotic bent.<ref name="nemi1">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 203</ref><ref name="vasava"/> Written in the ''champu'' metre, with the ancient town [[Banavasi]] as the background, it narrates the love story of a Kadamba prince and a princess who eventually marry after facing many obstacles.<ref name="champu"/> The story is based on a c.&nbsp;610 Sanskrit original called ''Vasavadatta'' by Subhandu.<ref name="vasava">Rice E. P. (1921), p. 43</ref> His other work, ''Neminathapurana'', unfinished on account of his death (and hence called ''Ardhanemi'' or "incomplete Nemi"), details the life of the 22nd&nbsp;Jain tirthankar [[Neminatha]] while treating the life of the god Krishna from a Jain angle.<ref name="nemi">Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 620; (1988), p. 1180</ref>   

Palkuriki Somanatha, a native of modern Karnataka or Andhra Pradesh, is considered one of the foremost multi-lingual Shaiva (or Shiva-following) poets of the 12th and 13th centuries. Historians are divided about the time and place of his birth and death and his original faith. He was adept in the Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada languages. He was a devotee of Basavanna (the founder of the Veerashaiva movement), and all his writings propagate that faith.<ref name="soma">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4133</ref> Arudra, Seshayya and Lakshmikantam believe he was born a brahmin and later adopted the Shaiva faith, although according to Bandaru Tammayya he was born a ''Jangama'' (follower of the Shaiva faith).<ref name="bandaru">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4133</ref> His time of birth has been identified as either the 12th&nbsp;century<ref name="belong">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 20</ref> or late 13th&nbsp;century.<ref name="second">Seshayya in Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4133</ref> In Kannada, his most important writings are ''Silasampadane'', ''Sahasragananama'' and ''Pancharatna''. His well-known poems, written in the ''ragale'' metre, are ''Basava ragale'', ''Basavadhya ragale'' and ''Sadguru ragale''.  He is known to have humbled many Vaishnava poets in debates.<ref name="soma"/><ref name="pal">Sastri (1955), p. 362</ref>

Other well-known personalities from the 12th&nbsp;century included several Jain writers. These include Aggala, who authored ''Chandraprabhapurana'' (1189),<ref name="vasava"/> an account of the life of the eighth Jain tirthankar Chandraprabha; Sujanottamsa, who wrote a [[panegyric]] on [[Gomateshwara]] of Shravanabelagola; and Vritta Vilasa, who authored ''Sastra sara'' and ''Dharmaparikshe'' (1160). The latter was Vilasa's version of the Sanskrit original of the same name written by Amitagati c.&nbsp;1014. In this ''champu'' writing, the author narrates the story of two [[Kshatriya]] princess who went to [[Benares]] and exposed the vices of the gods after discussions with the brahmins there. The author questions the credibility of [[Hanuman]] (the Hindu monkey god) and the [[Vanara]]s (monkey-like humanoids in the Hindu epic Ramayana). Although controversial, the work sheds useful information on contemporary religious beliefs.<ref name="goma">Rice B. L. (1897), p. 499</ref><ref name="amit">Rice E. P. (1921), pp. 37</ref> Kereya Padmarasa, a Veerashaiva poet patronised by King Narasimha&nbsp;I, wrote ''Dikshabodhe'' in the ''ragale'' metre in 1165.

Harihara's nephew and protege, the dramatic poet [[Raghavanka]] of [[Hampi]], whose style is compared to that of 10th-century poet [[Ranna]], was the first to establish the ''shatpadi'' metre in Kannada literature in  the epic ''Harishchandra Kavya'' (1200).<ref name="hari">Sastri (1955), p. 362</ref><ref name="hari1">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 20</ref> According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way.

His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the ''Siddharama charitra'' (or ''Siddharama Purana''), a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige;<ref name="sidda"/> the ''Somanatha charitra'', a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern [[Lakshmeshwar]]), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the ''Viresvara charita'', a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the ''Hariharamahatva'', an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and ''Sarabha charitra''. The last two classics are considered lost.<ref name="task"/><ref name="har">Sastri (1955), p. 362</ref>

In 1209, the  Jain scholar, minister, builder of temples and army commander [[Janna]] wrote, among other classics, ''Yashodhara Charite'', a unique set of stories in 310&nbsp;verses dealing with [[sadomasochism]], [[transmigration of the soul]], passion gone awry and cautionary morals for human conduct. The writing, although inspired by Vadiraja's Sanskrit classic of the same name, is noted for its original interpretation, imagery and style.<ref name="image">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4629</ref> In one story, the poet tells of the infatuation of a man for his friend's wife.

[[Andayya]], taking a non-conformist path that was never repeated in Kannada literature, wrote ''Madana Vijaya'' ("Triumph of cupid", 1217&ndash;1235) using only pure Kannada words (''desya'') and naturalised Sanskrit words (''tadbhava'') and totally avoiding assimilated Sanskrit words (''tatsamas'').<ref name="guna"/> This is seen by some as a rebuttal meant to prove that writing Kannada literature without borrowed Sanskrit words was possible.<ref name="chaste">Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 170</ref> The poem narrates the story of the moon being imprisoned by the god Shiva in his abode in the [[Himalaya]]s. In his anger, [[Kamadeva|Kama]] (Cupid, the god of love, also called Manmata) assailed Shiva with his arrows only to be cursed by Shiva and separated from his beloved. Kama then contrived to rid himself of Shiva's curse. The work also goes by other names such as ''Sobagina Suggi'' ("Harvest of Beauty"), ''Kavane Gella'' ("Cupid's Conquest") and ''Kabbigara-kava'' ("Poets defender").<ref name"cupid">Sastri (1955), p. 359</ref> Kama has an important place in Jain writings even before Andayya. The possibility that this writing was yet another subtle weapon in the intensifying conflict between the dominant Jains<ref name="dominate">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 65</ref> and the [[Veerashaiva]]s, whose popularity was on the rise, is not lost on historians.<ref name="sakkada">Nagaraj (2003), p. 366</ref> 

Mallikarjuna, a Jain ascetic, compiled an anthology of poems called ''Suktisudharnava'' ("Gems from the poets") in 1245 in the court of King [[Vira Someshwara]].<ref name="sukti">Rice E.P. (1921), p. 44&ndash;45</ref> Some interesting observations have been made by scholars about this important undertaking. While the anthology itself provides insight into poetic tastes of that period (and hence qualifies as a "history of Kannada literature"), it also performs the function of a "guide for poets", an assertive method of bridging the gap between courtly literary intelligentsia and folk poetry.<ref name="anthology">Nagaraj (2003), p. 363</ref> Being a guide for "professional intellectuals", the work, true to its nature, often includes poems eulogising kings and royalty but completely ignoring poems of the 12th-century vachana canon (Veerashaiva folk literature).<ref name="theorist"/> However, the selection of poems includes contributions from Harihara, the non-conformist Veerashaiva writer. This suggests a compromise by which the author attempts to include the "rebels".<ref name="theorist"/>

Other notable writers of the early 13th&nbsp;century were Bhanduvarma, author of ''Harivamsabhyudaya'' and ''Jiva sambhodana'' (1200), the latter bearing on morals and renunciation, and written addressing the soul;<ref name="sisu"/> Maghanandycharya, author of ''Sastrasara Samuccaya-tiku'' (1209);<ref name="tiku">Singh (2001), p. 975</ref>  Hastimalla, who worte ''Purvapurana'';<ref name="tiku"/> Chandrama, author of ''Karkala Gomateshvara charite'',<ref name="karkala">Singh (2001), p. 979</ref> and Sisumayana, who introduced a new form of composition called ''sangatya'' in 1232. He wrote an allegorical poem called ''Tripuradahana'' ("Burning of the triple fortress") and ''Anjanacharita''. The latter work was inspired by Ravisena's Sanskrit ''Padma charitra''.<ref name="guna"/><ref name="sisu">Sastri (1955), p. 359</ref> Somaraja, a Veerashaiva scholar, wrote a eulogy of Udbhata, the ruler of Gersoppa, and called it ''Sringarasara'' (or ''Udbhatakavya'', 1222).<ref name="vira">Narasimhacharya (1988), p. 21</ref> Other Jain writers were Parsva Pandita, author of ''Paravanathapurana'', and Gunavarma&nbsp;II, the author of the story of the ninth Jain tirthankar Pushpadanta called ''Pushpadanta purana'' (both were patronised by the Ratta kings of [[Saundatti]]).<ref name="guna">E.P.Rice (1921), pp. 43&ndash;44</ref><ref name="raja">Narasimhacharya (1988), pp. 20&ndash;21</ref> Polalva Dandanatha, a commander, minister, and the builder of the [[Harihareshwara temple]] in Harihar, wrote ''Haricharitra'' in 1224.

[[Keshiraja]] was a notable writer and grammarian of the 13th&nbsp;century. He came from a family of famous poet-writers. Although five of Keshiraja's writings are not traceable, his most enduring work on Kannada grammar, ''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]'' ("Mirror of Word Jewels", 1260), is available and testifies to his scholarly acumen and literary taste.<ref name="kesiraja">E.P.Rice (1921), p. 45</ref><ref name="keshi">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1476</ref><ref name="kesi">Sastri (1955), p. 359</ref> True to his wish that his writing on grammar should "last as long as the sun, the moon, the oceans and the [[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]] mountain lasted", ''Shabdamanidarpana'' is popular even today and is considered a standard authority on old Kannada grammar. It is prescribed as a textbook for students of graduate and post-graduate studies in the Kannada language. Although Keshiraja followed the model of Sanskrit grammar (of the Katantra school) and that of earlier writings on Kannada grammar (by King [[Amoghavarsha I]] of the 9th&nbsp;century and grammarian [[Nagavarma II]] of 1145), his work has originality.<ref name="keshi">Sahitya Akademi (1988), p. 1476</ref> Keshiraja's lost writings are ''Cholapalaka Charitam'', ''Sri Chitramale'', ''Shubhadraharana'', ''Prabodhachandra'' and ''Kiratam'' (or ''Kiratarjuniyam'').<ref name="keshi"/>

A major development of this period that would have a profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the [[Haridasa]] ("servants of [[Hari]] or [[Vishnu]]") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th&nbsp;century (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God.<ref name="tied">Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192&ndash;193</ref> The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of [[Madhvacharya]] of [[Udupi]]. [[Naraharitirtha]] (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of [[Vaishnava]] devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of [[Kalinga]].<ref name="bana"/> The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name="vijaya">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 192</ref> Only three of Naraharitirtha's  compositions are available today.<ref name="three">Shiv Prakash (1997), p. 195</ref>

Other writers worthy of mention are Mahabala Kavi, the author of ''Neminathapurana'' (1254), an account of the 22nd&nbsp;Jain tirthankar Neminatha,<ref name="vasava"/> and Kumudendu, author of a Jain version of the epic Ramayana in ''shatpadi'' metre in 1275. The effort was influenced by ''Pampa Ramayana'' of Nagachandra.<ref name="popular">Rice E. P. (1921), p. 45</ref> Kumara Padmarasa, son of Kereya Padmarasa, wrote the ''Sananda Charitre'' in ''shatpadi'' metre.<ref name="padma">Sahitya Academi (1996), p. 4003</ref> Ratta Kavi, a Jain noble, wrote a quasi-scientific piece called  ''Rattasutra'' (or ''Rattamala'') in 1300. The writing bears on natural phenomena such rain, earthquakes, lightning, planets and omens.<ref name="kesiraja"/><ref name="sisu"/> Towards the end of the Hoysala rule, Nagaraja wrote ''Punyasrava'' in 1331 in ''champu'' style, a work that narrates the stories of [[puranic]] heroes in 52&nbsp;tales and is said to be a translation from Sanskrit.<ref name="kesiraja"/><ref name="sisu"/>

==Sanskrit writings==
{{See also|Vaishnavism|Dvaita}}
[[Image:Melukote Cheluvarayaswami temple.JPG|upright|thumb|Cheluvaraya Swamy temple in [[Melkote]]. Philosopher Ramanujacharya's temporary refuge.]]
The Vaishnava movement in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after the arrival of the philosopher [[Ramanujacharya]] (1017&ndash;1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to [[Melkote]].<ref name="melkote">Kamath (2001), p. 151</ref> But this event had no impact on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238&ndash;1317), propounder of the ''Dvaita'' philosophy, did have a direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as ''haridasa sahitya'' (haridasa literature).<ref name="direct">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 192</ref> 

Born as Vasudeva in [[Pajaka]] village near Udupi in 1238, he learnt the [[Veda]]s and [[Upanishad]]s under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was initiated into ''[[sanyasa]]'' (asceticism) after which he earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha).<ref name="sanyas">Kamath (2001), p. 154</ref> Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first  notable disciple. Unlike [[Adi Shankaracharya]] (788&ndash;820) who preached [[Advaita]] philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).<ref name="vish">Kamath (2001), pp. 150, 155</ref>  

Madhvacharya taught complete devotion to the Hindu god Vishnu, emphasising ''Jnanamarga'' or the "path of knowledge", and insisted that the path of devotion "can help a soul to attain elevation" (''Athmonathi''). He was however willing to accept devotion to other Hindu deities as well.<ref name="deities">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 193</ref> He wrote 37 works in Sanskrit including  ''Dwadasha Sutra'' (in which his devotion to the god Vishnu found full expression), ''Gita Bhashya'', ''Gita Tatparya Nirnaya'', ''Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya'', ''Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya'', ''Mayavada Khandana'' and ''Vishnu Tattwa Nirnaya''.<ref name="matha"/><ref name="deities"/> To propagate his teachings he established eight monasteries near [[Udupi]], the Uttaradhi monastery, and the Raghavendra monastery in [[Mantralayam]] (in modern [[Andhra Pradesh]]) and [[Nanjanagud]] (near modern [[Mysore]]).<ref name="monastery">Kamath (2001), pp. 155&ndash;156</ref>   

The writings of Madhvacharya and Vidyatirtha (author of ''Rudraprshnabhashya'') may have been absorbed by Sayanacharya, brother of [[Vidyaranya]], the patron saint of the founders of the Vijayanagara empire in the 14th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Phil">K. T. Pandurangi in Kamath 2001, pp. 132&ndash;133</ref> Bharatasvamin (who was patronised by Hoysala King Ramanatha) wrote a commentary on ''Samaveda'',<ref name="svamin">Sastri (1955), p. 310</ref> Shadgurusishya wrote commentary on ''Aitareya Brahmana'' and ''Aranyaka'', and Katyayana wrote ''Sarvanukramani''. A family of hereditary poets whose names have not been identified held the title "Vidyacharkravarti" (poet laureate) in the Hoysala court. One of them wrote ''Gadyakarnamrita'', a description of the war between Hoysala king Vira Narasimha&nbsp;II and the [[Pandya]]s, in the early 13th&nbsp;century.<ref name="Vidyachakra">Sastri (1955), p. 316</ref> His grandson with the same title, in the court of king Veera Ballala&nbsp;III, composed a poem called ''Rukminikalyana'' in 16&nbsp;''kandas'' (chapters) and wrote commentaries (on poetics) on the ''Alankarasarvasva'' and ''Kavyaprakasa''.<ref name="Vidyachakra"/> Kalyani Devi, a sister of Madhvacharya, and Trivikrama, his disciple, wrote commentaries on the Dvaita philosophy. To Trivikrama is ascribed a poem narrating the story of Usha and Aniruddha called ''Ushaharana''. Narayana Pandita composed ''Madhwavijaya'', ''Manimanjari'' and a poem called ''Parijataharana''. The Jain writer Ramachandra Maladhari authored ''Gurupanchasmriti''.<ref name="ramachandra"/>

==Literature after the Hoysalas==
Literary developments during the Hoysala period had a marked influence on Kannada literature in the centuries to follow. These developments popularised folk metres which shifted the emphasis towards ''desi'' (native or folk) forms of literature.<ref name="verna">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 167</ref> With the waning of Jain literary output, competition between the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava writers came to the fore. The Veerashaiva writer [[Chamarasa]] (author of ''Prabhulingalile'', 1425) and his Vaishnava competitor [[Kumaravyasa]] (''Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari'', 1450) popularised the ''shatpadi'' metric tradition initiated by Hoysala poet Raghavanka, in the court of Vijayanagara King [[Deva Raya II]].<ref name="shat">Sastri (1955), p. 364</ref><ref name="shat1">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4003</ref> [[Lakshmisa]], the 16th&ndash;17th century writer of epic poems, continued the tradition in the  ''Jaimini Bharata'', a work that has remained popular even in the modern period.<ref name="reader">Sahitya Akademi, (1996), p. 4004</ref> The ''tripadi'' metre, one of the oldest in the Kannada language ([[Kappe Arabhatta]] inscription of 700), which was used by [[Akka Mahadevi]] (''Yoganna trividhi'', 1160), was popularised in the 16th century by the mendicant poet [[Sarvajna]].<ref name="name="sarvajna">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4392</ref> Even Jain writers, who had dominated courtly literature throughout the classical period with their Sanskritic ''champu'' style, began to use native metres. Among them, [[Ratnakaravarni]] is famous for successfully integrating an element of worldly pleasure into asceticism and for treating the topic of [[eroticism]] with discretion in a religious epic written in the native ''sangatya'' metre (a metre initiated by Hoysala poet Sisumayana), his ''magnum opus'', the ''Bharatadesa Vaibhava'' (c.&nbsp;1557).<ref name="pleasure">Nagaraj (2003), p. 373</ref><ref name="ratna">Sahitya Akademi (1987), pp. 453&ndash;454</ref>

Though the Vaishnava courtly writings in Kannada began with the Hoysala poet Rudrabhatta and the devotional song genre was initiated by Naraharitirtha, the Vaishnava movement began to exert a strong influence on Kannada literature only from the 15th century on. The Vaishnava writers consisted of two groups who seemed to have no interaction with each other: the [[Brahmin]] commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty, and the [[Bhakti]] (devotion) writers (also known as haridasas) who played no role in courtly matters.  The Bhakti writers took the message of God to the people in the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the ''kirthane'' (a musical composition with refrain, based on tune and rhythm), the ''suladi'' (a composition based on rhythm) and the ''ugabhoga'' (a composition based on melody). [[Kumara Vyasa]] and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while [[Purandara Dasa]] and [[Kanaka Dasa]] were the most notable of the Bhakti writers.<ref name="thimmanna">Nagaraj (2003), p. 368</ref><ref name="kirthane">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 193&ndash;194</ref> The philosophy of [[Madhvacharya]], which originated in the Kannada-speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries. The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of ''jnana'' (enlightenment), ''bhakti'' (devotion) and ''vairagya'' (detachment).<ref name="bhaktimusic">Sharma (1961), p. 514&ndash;515</ref><ref name="south">Shiva Prakash (1997), pp. 192&ndash;196</ref>

Vachana poetry, developed in reaction to the rigid caste-based Hindu society, attained its peak in popularity among the under-privileged during the 12th century. Though these poems did not employ any regular metre or rhyme scheme, they are known to have originated from the earlier ''tripadi'' metrical form.<ref name="metric">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 169</ref> The Veerashaivas, who wrote this poetry, had risen to influential positions by the Vijayanagara period (14th century).<ref name="position">Shiva Prakash (1997), p. 188</ref> Court ministers and nobility belonging to the faith, such as Lakkanna Dandesa and Jakkanarya, not only wrote literature but also patronised talented writers and poets.<ref name="student">Sahitya Akademi (1996), p. 4003</ref><ref name="sthala">Rice E.P. (1921), p. 70</ref><ref name="sthala1">Sastri (1955), p. 363</ref> Veerashaiva anthologists of the 15th and 16th centuries began to collect Shaiva writings and vachana poems, originally written on palm leaf manuscripts.<ref name="position"/> Because of the cryptic nature of the poems, the anthologists added commentaries to them, thereby providing their hidden meaning and esoteric significance.<ref name="eso">Sahitya Akademi (1987), p. 761</ref> An interesting aspect of this anthological work was the translation of the Shaiva canon into Sanskrit, bringing it into the sphere of the Sanskritic (''marga'' or main stream as opposed to ''desi'' or folk) cultural order.<ref name="sanskritic">Nagraj (2003), p. 368</ref>
