'''Emil Gregory Steiner''' (born November 30, 1978) is an [[United States|American]] [[novelist]], and [[journalist]] who currently writes and edits The League [http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/] -- [[washingtonpost.com]]'s NFL discussion platform. He has also served as the offbeat news blogger for [[The Washington Post]] and as a contributor to [[MSNBC]], [[Washington Post Radio]], [[NPR]], [[CNN]], [[WPHT]] and the [[BBC]].

Steiner is an American, and a descendant of Holocaust survivors, born in [[West Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] on November 30, 1978.  He lived in [[Philadelphia]], [[London]], and [[Prague]] attending [[Friends' Central School]], in [[Wynnewood]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

After graduating in 2001 he worked as an [[journalist]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].  His first novel, ''Drunk Driving'' [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1413753302] was published in April, 2005.

Steiner made international news in June 2007 with his live-blogging of ''[[Pearson v. Chung]]'', the $54 million pants lawsuit. The case involved DC [[Administrative Law]] Judge [[Roy Pearson]] suing his dry cleaner for $54 million under the [[Washington, D.C.|DC]] consumer protection act after they lost his pants.  Steiner's exclusive live-blogging coverage provided the only up-to-the minute reporting from inside the [[Washington, DC]] [[Superior Court]]house.

In October 2007 Steiner published a column <U+201C>Cry Me a River Ellen Degeneres<U+201D> [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat/2007/10/cry_me_a_river_ellen_degeneres_1.html] Steiner pointed out that the talk show host<U+2019>s tears for her dog Iggy may in fact have been damage control.[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0710/17/sbt.01.html]

On November 6, 2007 [[Washington Post]] [[columnist]] Emil Steiner in his OFF/beat blog [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat] reported on the emerging menace/hoax of [[Jenkem]] an African drug made from the fumes of raw sewage.  In his article "Jenkem Madness?" [http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat/2007/11/jenkem_madness_1.html] he cited "a spokesman for the [[Drug Enforcement Agency]] [who] insists that 'there are people in America trying [Jenkem].'" The unnamed DEA spokesman stated that the agency had yet to test Jenkem, however volunteering a theory that "hallucinations from methane fumes" are involved. He also labeled any use of Jenkem "dangerous, bad and stupid."

In May 2008, Steiner moved his OFF/beat blog from [[washingtonpost.com]] to the online tabloid expressnightout.com [http://expressnightout.com/content/offbeat/].
