==Early life==
Harris was born into a middle-class African American family on [[January 17]], [[1899]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. His father was a butcher at a meat shop, and his mother was a schoolteacher.<ref name="Bio"/> The family that ran the Richmond meat shop that Harris' father worked at was German American. As a result of his frequent contact with the family, Harris learned [[German language|German]] and became a fluent speaker of the language. Harris' master of the language would help him later in life, when he examined the writings of German economists and social reformers like [[Karl Marx]].<ref name="Bio"/> 

He attended [[Virginia Union University]] where he studied [[anthropology]], [[black studies]] and [[economics]], graduating in 1922 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree.<ref name="Banks">{{cite web

==Career==
He later published two articles in the [[National Urban League]]'s journal, ''Opportunity'', that discussed the difficulties faced by African American mineworkers. His work in this field also addressed his concern about blacks and their white counterparts. Harris examined race prejudice of blacks by white workers.<ref name="Bio"/> Meanwhile, Harris taught at [[West Virginia State University]], a small historically black public college in [[Institute, West Virginia]]. He taught for a year, before he shifted directions and took the position as director of the Minneapolis Urban League. As director, he prepared a detailed report titled ''The Negro Population in Minneapolis: A Study of Race Relations'' dealing with the living conditions of African Americans in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. Harris described the physical and socio-economic conditions of African Americans in Minneapolis in 1926.<ref>{{cite web

In [[1927]], just a year into his doctorate studies, Harris joined the faculty of [[Howard University]]. There, Harris collaborated with fellow black colleagues [[Ralph Bunche]] and [[E. Franklin Frazier]], and attacked old values and outlooks on race.<ref name="AAR"/>  

Continuing with previous writings, Harris wrote his Ph.D thesis on the rift between African American and white labor in the United States. In 1930, he became the second African American to receive a doctorate in Economics in the United States, following Sadie Mosell Alexander.<ref name="Bio"/> The following year, he collaborated his thesis with political scientist, Sterling Spero, to produce a famous study of African American labor history entitled ''The Black Worker, the Negro & the Labor Movement''.<ref name="AAR"/> Harris believed that African Americans needed to contribute to the development of a working-class political party in the United States. He expressed dislike for other strategies like rebellion, secession, or the various [[Back-to-Africa movement|Back to Africa]] movements <U+2014> which Harris described as "Negro Zionism" <U+2014> led by such figures as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie I]].<ref name="Bio"/> 

In ''The Black Worker'', Spero and Harris asserted that African Americans could put an end to the racial antagonism in the [[working class]]. They wrote about the history of the racial predicament between whites and blacks had stemmed from the days of slavery. They argued that many African Americans had just recently migrated to the urban setting, and had been unaware of [[trade union]]ism and its benefits. They stated that the anti-union beliefs held by organizations such as the [[National Urban League]] also provided for the racial division seen in the working class between blacks and whites. Harris also was the author of a [[Progressive Labor Party (USA)|Progressive Labor Party]] pamphlet in 1930 that called for the formation of a working-class political party in the United States.<ref name="Bio"/>

Harris, along with Frazier and Bunche, led the attack on the older generations at the [[NAACP]]'s 1933 Amenia Conference. Harris' radical beliefs prompted a 1935 report entitled the ''Harris Report'' suggesting that the NAACP take a more active and affirmative stance on race relations in the United States.<ref name="AAR"/> As the [[Great Depression]] progressed, Harris' radicalism declined. As Harris wrote in the 1957 introduction to his personal collection of essays, he was "emerging from a state of social rebellion [while] still adher[ing] somewhat to socialistic ideas by the late 1920s."<ref name="Bio"/> He published his most famous economics work in 1936, ''The Negro as Capitalist: A Study of Banking and Business''. In the work, Harris wrote about the growing anti-business sentiment of the [[Great Depression]]. Harris argued that black businessmen were under the false sense of racial solidarity between whites and blacks. He said that African Americans needed to participate in trade unionism with white businessmen. This was the reason for the problems in the development of black business.<ref>{{cite book | last= Young | first= James O. | title=Black Writers of the Thirties|publisher= [[Louisiana State University]] Press |id=ISBN 0807100609|year=1973| pages=pp35-63 |location=[[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]}}</ref> Harris concluded that the black middle class was using their racial pride and unity to support businesses controlled by the American middle class.<ref>{{cite book | last= Harris | first= Abram Lincoln | title=The Negro as Capitalist|publisher= The American Academy of Political and Social Sciences |id=ISBN 0837127319|year=1936| pages=pp49-50|location=[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]}}</ref> He felt that blacks were not reaching out to whites, and black business would not grow if there was no interracial trade. In reference to black complaints against Jewish businessmen, Harris said: {{cquote|In their confusion, the masses are led to direct their animus against the Jew and against whiteness. The real forces behind their discomfort are masked by race which prevents them from seeing that what the Negro businessman wants most of all is freedom to monopolize and exploit he market they provide. They cannot see that they have no greater exploiter than the black capitalist who lives upon low-waged if not sweated labor, although he and his family may and often do, live in conspicuous luxury.<ref>Harris (1936), p184</ref>}} Despite the heavy criticism against fellow black businesspeople, Harris' book achieved notability and recognition in the field of economics during the [[Great Depression]]. In 1937, Harris founded the liberal Social Science Division of Howard University, and served as the group's leader through the late 1930s and early 1940s.<ref name="AAR"/> 

Harris left Howard in 1945 and moved to the [[University of Chicago]], and became one of the first [[African American]] academics with a high position at a historically white institution. His move was facilitated on part of the efforts of Chicago economist [[Frank Knight]], one of the founders of the famed [[Chicago school (economics)|Chicago School]] of economics that fostered the likes of [[Noble Prize]]-winning economists [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]]. Knight had been publishing many of Harris' papers on the thematics of economic doctrine in the ''Journal of Political Economy'' since the late 1920s when Harris was at Howard. With his move to [[Chicago]], Harris' economic ideologies also seemed to change. His writings took more of the tone of [[orthodox economics]], and his previous defense of [[Karl Marx]] and other radical economists had turned into critical examinations of the works of these men.<ref name="Bio"/> 

Harris expressed deep concerns about the [[Soviet Union]]'s totalitarian direction led by [[Joseph Stalin]] in works such as ''Black Communist in Dixie'', published in the National Urban League magazine, ''Opportunity''.<ref name="AAR"/> However, Harris became silenced on the topic of race, and did not write about it for the remainder of his academic career. Harris spent the rest of his life at the [[University of Chicago]] and died on [[November 18]], [[1963]].

==Legacy==
Harris is best known for his work as an economist and social critic of African American business. He had a heavy influence on both black radical and neo-conservative thought.<ref name="AAR"/> A recipient of the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for Economics in 1935, 1936, 1943 and 1953,<ref>{{cite web

His early works such as ''The Negro as Capitalist'' set the precedent for contemporary African American radical thought. Harris' great number of works on race relations such as ''The Black Worker'' served as a model for future African American studies. His essays in ''The Journal of Political Economy'' have played a significant role for institutionalist economists and for economists studying the history of economic doctrines.<ref name="Bio"/> He is still widely regarded as one of the first African Americans to achieve prominence in academia in the early 20th century, and an influential figure on a wide range of African American topics of interest.
