'''Adam Michnik''' ({{IPA-pl|<U+02C8>adam <U+02C8>mix<U+0272>ik}}; born 17 October 1946 <!-- Please do not put a different birth name here without a reference disputed by subjects family --> in [[Warsaw]], Poland) is a historian, essayist, former dissident, [[Intellectual#Public_intellectual_life|public intellectual]], and the editor-in-chief of Poland's largest newspaper ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''. Brought up in a family of convinced communists, Michnik was one of the most relentless opponents of the communist regime, while remaining faithful to the left-wing ethos. A legendary figure of the Polish anti-communist oppostion, he was imprisoned, first, after the 1968 [[1968 Polish political crisis|March Events]], then, after the imposition of the [[Martial Law in Poland|Martial Law]] in 1981. Michnik also played a crucial role during the [[Polish Round Table Talks]], as a result of which the communists conceded to call [[Polish legislative election, 1989|elections]], which were subsequently won by [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Even though he has withdrawn from active politics he has "maintained an influential voice through journalism".<ref>Judt, Tony, ''Postwar; A History of Europe since 1945'', p.694</ref> He is a laureate of many awards and honors, including a Knight of the Legion of Honour and [[Europeans of the Year|European of the Year]].

==Family==

Adam Michnik was born to a family of Jewish communists. His father, Ozjasz (Uzziah) Szechter, was the first secretary of the [[Communist Party of Western Ukraine]] and his mother, Helena (n<U+00E9>e Michnik), a historian and children's book writer. His half brother, [[Stefan Michnik]], was a judge in the 1950s during the [[Stalinist]] period and is accused of passing death sentences on Polish resistance movement soldiers. He was forced to emigration after the [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968]]; from then on, he supported the anti-communist civil resistance.

==Education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2008}}

Famous KOR leader. While attending primary school, he was an active member of Walter<U+2019>s Troop in [[Polish Scouting Association]] (ZHP), which was led by [[Jacek Kuro<U+0144>]]. During secondary school, the Walter<U+2019>s Troop was banned, and he began to participate at meetings of Klub Krzywego Ko<U+0142>a (Club of the Crooked Circle). After its closing in 1962, with the encouragement from [[Jan J<U+00F3>zef Lipski]] and under Adam Schaff<U+2019>s protection, he founded a discussion group, "Contradiction Hunters Club" (Klub Poszukiwaczy Sprzeczno<U+015B>ci) and became associated with the left wing student oppositionist group, the [[Komandosi]]. Disappointed with life in the People's Republic of Poland, young people were discussing ways to change it. They read and analyzed the classical texts of [[leftist]] thinkers.

In 1964 he began studying history at [[Warsaw University]]. A year later he was suspended because he disseminated an open letter to the members of [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR) among his school mates. Its authors, [[Jacek Kuro<U+0144>]] and [[Karol Modzelewski]] appealed for a beginning of reforms which would repair the political system in Poland. In 1965, the PZPR forbade his texts to be printed. In 1966 he was suspended for the second time for organizing a discussion meeting with [[Leszek Ko<U+0142>akowski]], who was expelled from the PZPR several weeks earlier, for criticizing its leaders. Since that time he wrote under a pseudonym to several newspapers, for example: <U+201C><U+017B>ycie Gospodarcze<U+201D>, Wi<U+0119><U+017A><U+201D>, <U+201C>Literatura<U+201D>.

In March 1968 he was expelled from the University for his activities during [[1968 Polish political crisis]]. The crisis was ignited by the ban of [[Kazimierz Dejmek]]'s adaptation of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]<U+2019>s <U+201C>[[Dziady (poem)|Dziady]]<U+201D> (Forefathers' Eve) in the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre]]. The play contained many anti-Russian allusions, which were greeted with enthusiastic applause by the audience. Michnik and another student, [[Henryk Szlajfer]], recounted the sitation to a correspondent of [[Le Monde]], "whose report was then carried on [[Radio Free Europe]]".<ref>Judt, Tony, ''Postwar; A History of Europe since 1945'', p.433</ref> Both Michnik and Szlajfer were expelled from the university. Upon their expulsion, students organized demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the riot police and "worker-squads".

[[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Gomu<U+0142>ka]]{{cn|date=June 2012}} used Michnik's Jewish background to wage an [[anti-Semitic]] capaign, blaming the Jews for the crisis. Michnik was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment for <U+201C>acts of hooliganism<U+201D>.

In 1969, he was released from prison under an amnesty, but he was forbidden to continue his studies. Not until the middle of the 1970s was he allowed to continue his studies of history, which he finished at the [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in [[Pozna<U+0144>]].

==Opposition==

After he was released from prison, he worked for two years as a welder at the R<U+00F3><U+017C>a Luxemburg ([[Rosa Luxemburg]]) Industrial Plant and then, on the recommendation of [[Jacek Kuro<U+0144>]], he became private secretary to [[Antoni S<U+0142>onimski]].

In 1976<U+2013>77 he lived in Paris. After he returned to Poland, he got involved in the activity of [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (KOR), which had already existed for a couple of months. It was one of the best known opposition organizations of the 1970s. He became one of the most active opposition activists and also one of the supporters of the Society for Educational Courses (Towarzystwo Kurs<U+00F3>w Naukowych).

Between 1977 and 1989, he was the editor or co-editor of underground newspapers published illegally, [[samizdat]]: <U+201E>[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]<U+201D>, <U+201E>Zapis<U+201D>, <U+201E>Krytyka<U+201D>. He was also a member of the management of one of the biggest underground publishers: NOWa.

In years 1980<U+2013>1989 he was an adviser to both the Independent Self-governing trade union "[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]" (NSZZ <U+201E>Solidarno<U+015B><U+0107><U+201D>) in the Mazovia Region and to Foundry Workers Committee of <U+201C>Solidarity<U+201D>.

When [[martial law]] was declared, in December 1981, he was at first an internee, but when he refused to sign, a <U+201D>loyalty oath<U+201D> and assent to voluntarily leave the country, he was jailed and accused of an <U+201C>attempt to overthrow socialism<U+201D>. He was in jail without a verdict until 1984, because the prosecutor<U+2019>s office prolonged the trial on purpose.

Adam Michnik demanded to end proceedings against himself or have his case dismissed. Meanwhile, he wanted to be granted the status of a political prisoner, and went on a hunger strike in jail. In 1984 he was released from jail, under an amnesty.

He took part in an attempt to organize a strike in the Gda<U+0144>sk shipyard. As a consequence, he was rearrested in 1985 and this time sentenced to three years imprisonment. He was released in the following year again under another amnesty.

==Activity since 1989==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2008}}
In 1988 he became an adviser of [[Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa]]<U+2019>s informal Coordination Committee, and later he became a member of the [[Solidarity Citizens' Committee]]. He took an active part in planning and preliminary negotiations for the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] in 1989, in which he also participated.
Adam Michnik inspired and collaborated with the editors of the ''Ulam Quarterly'' prior to 1989 that journal pioneered the World Wide Web in the USA.

After the Round Table Talks, Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa told him to organize a big Polish national daily, which was supposed to be an <U+2018>organ<U+2019> of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, before the upcoming elections. This newspaper, under the Round Table agreement, was ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' ("Election Newspaper"), because it was supposed to appear till the end of the parliamentary election in 1989. After organizing this newspaper on the basis of journalists who worked in the <U+201E>Biuletyn Informacyjny<U+201D>, Adam Michnik became its editor-in-chief.

In the elections to the [[Contract Sejm]] on 4 June 1989 he became a Member of Parliament from Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa<U+2019>s Solidarity Citizens' Committee electoral register, as a candidate for the city of [[Bytom]].

Between 12 April and 27 June 1990 Michnik together with [[Bogdan Kroll]], director of the central archive [[Archiwum Akt Nowych]], and historians [[Andrzej Ajnenkiel]] and [[Jerzy Holzer]] had access to the archives of the Polish [[Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration of the Republic of Poland|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MSW). This group was called <U+201C>Michnik<U+2019>s Committee<U+201D> and was brought into being by an initiative of the historian [[Henryk Samsonowicz]]. The result of three months' work was a short official report which stated that archives are incomplete.

Both as a Member of Parliament and as editor of ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'' he actively supported Prime Minister [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]<U+2019>s government and his candidature in the [[Polish presidential election, 1990|presidential election campaign]] against Lech Wa<U+0142><U+0119>sa in 1990. After the breakup of the Citizens<U+2019> Committee and Mazowiecki's failure, Michnik withdrew from his direct involvement in politics and did not run for a seat in the [[Polish parliamentary election, 1991|next parliamentary election]], instead focusing on editorial and journalistic activities. Under his leadership, ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' was converted into a widely read and influential daily newspaper in Poland. On the basis of ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' assets [[Agora SA]] partnership came into existence. Currently (in May 2004) it is one of the biggest media concerns in Poland, administrating 11 titles monthly issued, portal gazeta.pl, outdoor advertising AMS, and shares in several radio stations. Adam Michnik does not have any shares in Agora and does not hold any office headship, excluding head editor, which is unusual in economic field in Poland. Michnik<U+2019>s shares are kept by Agora.

Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in his expose in September 1989 used a term broad-stroke policy which began new so-called [[broad-stroke]] attitude to political history of the most recent past. He is proponent and advocate of this term. In ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' he used his personal influence to protect General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] and General [[Czes<U+0142>aw Kiszczak]] from the social- political- judicial cleansing campaign that refers to different periods when they held party and civil functions in [[People<U+2019>s Republic of Poland]] (PRL). He postulated for quick and efficient adjudication of brought penal actions and to stop press battle. Crucial role played a famous interview <U+201C>[[Po<U+017C>egnanie z broni<U+0105>. Adam Michnik- Czes<U+0142>aw Kiszczak.]]<U+201D> by [[Agnieszka Kublik]] and [[Monika Olejnik]] which was published in ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' on 3 February 2001.

On 27 December 2002 Adam Michnik and [[Pawe<U+0142> Smole<U+0144>ski]] revealed the so-called <U+201C>[[Rywin affair]]<U+201D> which was to be explained by a specially called select committee.

In autumn 2004 due to health problems (he suffered from tuberculosis) he resigned from active participation in editing ''Gazeta Wyborcza'' and passed his duties to editorial colleague [[Helena <U+0141>uczywo]].

On the anniversary of the introduction of martial law, on 13 December 2005, Michnik delivered exposition at the University of Warsaw (article published in "Gazeta Wyborcza") in which he appealed to president [[Lech Kaczy<U+0144>ski]] for statutory abolition for those who were responsible for the martial law. The article was a response to information about instituting an inquiry by [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) against General Jaruzelski. Michnik appealed about abolition even earlier- in 1991 (during the exposition on Faculty of Law at University of Maria Curie- Sk<U+0142>odowska in Lublin (UMCS), "Gazeta w Lublinie" 11 December 1991) and also in 2001 in the article "Stan wojenny 20 lat p<U+00F3><U+017A>niej" ("Gazeta Wyborcza" 12 December 2001).

He is a member of Association of Polish Writers and [[Council on Foreign Relations]].
