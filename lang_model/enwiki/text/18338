The '''Columbia Slough''' is a narrow waterway, about {{convert|19|mi|km|}} long, in the [[floodplain]] of the [[Columbia River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]].<ref name="BES">{{cite web  | title = Columbia Slough Watershed | publisher = Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, City of Portland | date = 2008 | url = http://www.portlandonline.com/bes/index.cfm?c=32202 | accessdate = May 25, 2008}}</ref> From its source in the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] suburb of [[Fairview, Oregon|Fairview]], the Columbia Slough meanders west through [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] and Portland to the [[Willamette River]], about {{convert|1|mi|km|1}} from the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia.<ref name="topoquest">{{cite web | author = United States Geological Survey |title = United States Geological Survey Topographic Map, Sauvie Island, OR quad | publisher = TopoQuest | url = http://www.topoquest.com/map.php?lat=45.63642&lon=-122.75799&datum=nad83&zoom=8&map=auto&coord=d&mode=zoomout&size=m| accessdate = December 26, 2008 }}</ref> It is a remnant of the historic [[wetland]]s between the mouths of the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]] to the east and the Willamette River to the west. [[Levee]]s surround much of the main [[Slough (wetland)|slough]] as well as many side sloughs, detached sloughs, and nearby lakes.  [[Drainage district]] employees control water flows with pumps and floodgates. [[Tide|Tidal]] fluctuations cause reverse flow on the lower slough. 

The Columbia floodplain, formed by geologic processes including [[lava]] flows, volcanic eruptions, and the [[Missoula Floods]], is part of the Portland Basin, which extends across the Columbia River from [[Multnomah County, Oregon]], into [[Clark County, Washington]]. Five percent of Oregon's population, about 158,000&nbsp;people, live in the slough [[drainage basin|watershed]] of about {{convert|51|sqmi|km2}}.<ref name = "BES"/> Municipal wells near the upper slough provide supplemental drinking water to Portland and nearby cities. The cities, the drainage districts, the county, and a regional government, [[Metro (Oregon regional government)|Metro]], have overlapping jurisdictions in the watershed. A regional agency operates [[Portland International Airport]] along the middle slough and marine terminals near the lower slough. The [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] (DEQ) and the city's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) deal with environmental issues.

Long before [[European American]]s explored the region, tribes of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19th&nbsp;century fur trappers and explorers including [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark]] visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. The newcomers farmed, cut timber, built houses, and by the early 20th&nbsp;century established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines, and industries near the slough. Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area. A flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of [[Vanport City, Oregon|Vanport]], which was never rebuilt. 

Used as a waste repository during the first half of the 20th&nbsp;century and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the slough became one of Oregon's most polluted waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and industrial waste, were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment, and over the next six decades the federal [[Clean Water Act]] and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads. The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57,000&nbsp;people,<ref name ="BES"/> which is also frequented by more than 150&nbsp;bird species and 26&nbsp;fish species and animals including [[North American River Otter|otter]]s, [[beaver]], and [[coyote]]s.<ref name = "7-12"/> One of the nation's largest freshwater urban wetlands, [[Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area]],<ref name="Friends"/> shares the lower slough watershed with a sewage treatment plant, marine terminals, a golf course, and a car racetrack. Watercraft able to portage over [[culvert]]s and levees can travel the entire length of the slough. The [[40 Mile Loop]] and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks.

==Name==
''Slough'' usually rhymes with ''shoe'' in the U.S. except in [[New England]], where it usually rhymes with ''now'', the preferred British pronunciation.<ref name ="Webster"/> ''Slough'' may mean a place of deep mud or [[bog|mire]], a swamp, a river [[inlet]] or backwater, or a creek in a [[marsh]] or [[mudflat|tide flat]].<ref name ="Webster">{{cite web | title = slough | work = Merriam-Webster Online| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slough | accessdate = December 29, 2008}}</ref> The Columbia Slough is classified as a "stream" in the [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS).<ref name="gnismouth"/> The slough takes its name from the Columbia River, of which it was historically a side channel or [[anabranch]]. [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]], a Boston fur trader and whaler who sailed partway up the Columbia River in 1792, named the river after his ship, ''[[Columbia Rediviva]]''.<ref name = "McArthur"/> The Columbia part of the ship's name belonged to the tradition of naming things after explorer [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name = "McArthur">{{cite book | last = McArthur | first = Lewis A. | coauthors = McArthur, Lewis L. | title = Oregon Geographic Names, Seventh Edition | publisher = Oregon Historical Society Press | date = 2003 | location = Portland, Oregon | pages = 220&ndash;21 | isbn = 0-87595-277-1}}</ref>

Running slightly north of and parallel to [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] (Sandy Boulevard), the slough flows by [[Jacob Zimmerman House| Zimmerman Heritage Farm]] on the [[wikt:left bank|left]] (south) about {{convert|17.5|mi|km}} from the mouth, Big Four Corners Wetlands on the [[wikt:right bank|right]] shortly thereafter, and receives Wilkes Creek on the left shortly after that. At about [[river mile]] (RM)&nbsp;15.5 or river kilometer (RK)&nbsp;24.9, it passes through a gated levee that separates the upper slough from the middle slough. Soon it passes Prison Pond Wetlands near Inverness Jail and connects to Johnson Lake Slough, all on the left. Shortly thereafter, it flows under [[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|Interstate 205]]. From here and for most of the rest of its course, the slough runs parallel to and slightly north of Columbia Boulevard. Passing Johnson Lake on the left, it crosses the Colwood National Golf Course and flows by Portland International Airport and an [[Oregon Air National Guard]] base on the right. On the left is Whitaker Ponds Natural Area. Shortly thereafter, it receives Whitaker Slough on the left and crosses the Broadmoor Golf Course. Between {{convert|9|and|8|mi|km}} from the mouth, it receives Buffalo Slough from the left and passes by the defunct Peninsula Drainage Canal (City Canal), which lies to the slough's right. At this point, it passes through a second gated levee that separates the middle slough from the lower slough and its tidal flow reversals.<ref name="paddler's map"/><ref name= "Houck"/> 

In the next stretch, the Columbia Slough flows by Portland Meadows [[horse racing]] track on the right and crosses under [[Interstate 5 in Oregon|Interstate 5]] at about RM&nbsp;7 (RK&nbsp;11). Beyond the interstate, to the slough's north lies [[Delta Park]], [[Portland International Raceway]], and the Heron Lakes Golf Course. Until flooding destroyed it in 1948, the city of Vanport occupied this site. To the south is the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.<ref name="paddler's map"/><ref name="Houck">Houck, pp. 279&ndash;319.</ref> 

The slough flows through the Wapato Wetland and by the Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, including the former St. Johns Landfill, on the right at about RM&nbsp;3 (RK&nbsp;4.8) from the Willamette River, and by Pier Park on the left. Shortly thereafter, it turns sharply north for the rest of its course. It receives North Slough, connected to Bybee Lake, on the right, and passes through the Ramsey Lake Wetlands and [[Kelley Point Park]] before entering the Willamette River about {{convert|1|mi|km|}} from its confluence with the Columbia River. The mouth of the Columbia River is about {{convert|101|mi|km}} further downstream at [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]] on the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="topoquest"/><ref name="paddler's map"/><ref name="Houck"/>

==Watershed==
Draining about {{convert|51|sqmi|km2}}, the Columbia Slough watershed lies in the [[floodplain]] of the Columbia River between the [[River delta|mouth]]s of the [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]] to the east and the Willamette River.<ref name="about"/> Parts of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, [[Maywood Park, Oregon|Maywood Park]], [[Wood Village, Oregon| Wood Village]], and [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] Multnomah County lie within the [[drainage basin]] (watershed).<ref name="about"/> As of 2005, about 158,000&nbsp;people, 5&nbsp;percent of Oregon's population, lived in the basin.<ref name ="BES"/>

The watershed includes residential neighborhoods, agriculture, the airport, open spaces, 54&nbsp;schools, interstate highways, railways, commercial businesses, and heavy and light industry.<ref name = "4-6to8"/> In general, the northern part is industrial and commercial; the southern part is residential, and agricultural areas lie to the east.<ref name = "4-6to8"/> As of 2001, single-family residential [[zoning|zone]]s covered 33&nbsp;percent of the watershed, and mixed-use zones accounted for another 33&nbsp;percent.<ref name = "4-6to8"/> The other zones were 12&nbsp;percent industrial, 12&nbsp;percent parks or open space; 6&nbsp;percent multi-family residential, 3&nbsp;percent commercial, and 2&nbsp;percent were for farming or forests.<ref name = "4-6to8"/> As of 2005, about 3,900&nbsp;businesses operated in the watershed and employed about 57,000&nbsp;people.<ref name = "4-6to8">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 4: Land Use and Demographics", pp. 6&ndash;8</ref> 

Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the watersheds of the Sandy River to the east, [[Johnson Creek (Willamette River)|Johnson Creek]] to the south, the Willamette to the south and west, and the Columbia to the north. Lying slightly north of the watershed, large islands in the Columbia River include, from east to west, McGuire Island, [[Government Island (Oregon)|Government Island]], Lemon Island, and Tomahawk Island, which is connected to [[Hayden Island, Portland, Oregon|Hayden Island]]. Bordered by the Columbia and two arms of the Willamette, [[Sauvie Island]] lies just west of the mouth of the slough.<ref name="RandPortlandmap">{{cite map | publisher = Rand McNally | title = Streets of Portland | edition = 2006 |isbn = 0-528-86776-8}}</ref><ref name="RandVancouvermapmap">{{cite map | publisher = Rand McNally | title = Vancouver, Camas/Washougal Washington | edition = 2003 |isbn = 0-528-99919-2}}</ref>

===Jurisdiction===
Many governmental entities share responsibility for the slough and its drainage basin.

The Columbia Slough is part of the roughly {{convert|770|mi2|km2|adj=on}} Portland Basin, which lies at the northern end of the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon and extends north into [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] in the state of [[Washington]].<ref name="Washington DNR">{{cite web  |last = Evarts |first = Russell C. |date= 2004| title = Geologic Map of the Saint Helens Quadrangle, Columbia County, Oregon, and Clark and Cowlitz Counties, Washington |publisher= United States Geological Survey |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/2004/2834/ |accessdate = October 6, 2008}}</ref> The region is underlain by solidified [[lava]]s of the [[Columbia River Basalt Group]] that are up to 16&nbsp;million years old.<ref>Bishop, pp. 132&ndash;40</ref> Covered by later [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits, the basalts lie more than {{convert|1000|ft|m}} below the surface within the basin.<ref name="Washington DNR">{{cite web  |date= 2008| title = Geology of Washington<U+2014>Portland Basin  |publisher= Washington State Department of Natural Resources |url= http://www.dnr.wa.gov/ResearchScience/Topics/GeologyofWashington/Pages/portland.aspx |accessdate = October 5, 2008}}</ref>  About 10&nbsp;million years ago, eruptions of Cascade Range volcanoes to the east sent flows of mud, ash, and eroded volcanic debris into the Columbia, which was powerful enough to carry the material downstream.<ref name="Bishop 174">Bishop, pp. 174&ndash;75</ref> Deposited above the basalt during the [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]], these loose sands and gravels formed part of what is known as the Troutdale Formation. Extending to the [[Tualatin River]] Valley to the south and into Clark County on the north, the formation is an [[aquifer]] that is the primary source of drinking water for [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in Washington and an auxiliary source for Portland.<ref name="Bishop 174"/>

The Portland Basin is being pulled slowly apart between [[Fault (geology)|fault]]s in the [[Tualatin Mountains]] (West Hills) on the west side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]] further east. About 3&nbsp;million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin, stretched crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, cinders, and debris from these [[Boring Lava Field]] volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.<ref> Bishop, pp. 192&ndash;93</ref>

About 15,000&nbsp;years ago, cataclysmic [[ice age]] events known as the [[Missoula Floods]] or Bretz Floods originating in the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]] region of northern [[Idaho]] inundated the Columbia River basin many times. These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment. Water filled the entire Columbia Gorge to overflowing and turned the Willamette Valley into a lake {{convert|100|mi|km}} long, {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} wide and {{convert|300|ft|m|-1}} deep. The floodwaters ripped the face off [[Rocky Butte]] in Portland and deposited a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on}} gravel bar, [[Alameda Ridge]], that runs parallel to and slightly south of the Columbia Slough.<ref>Bishop, pp. 226&ndash;29</ref> 

Faults associated with the expanding Portland Basin are capable of producing significant earthquakes. More than a thousand earthquakes, many too small to be felt, have been recorded in the basin since 1841. The stronger ones reached about magnitude 5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. In 1892, one estimated at magnitude 5 shook downtown Portland for about 30&nbsp;seconds. In 1962, one centered about {{convert|7|mi|km}} north of Portland was estimated at between magnitude 4.9 and 5.2.<ref>Bishop, pp. 248&ndash;49.</ref>

==Hydrology==
===Rainfall and runoff===
Based on records from 1961 to 1990, the watershed's average annual precipitation, as measured at Portland International Airport, is about {{convert|36|in|mm}}.<ref name ="NOAA">{{cite web | last = National Weather Service, Portland, Oregon  | title = Portland's Monthly and Annual Precipitation Totals | publisher = National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |year=2007 | url = http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/pqr/pdxclimate/PG65.html | accessdate = December 1, 2008}}</ref> About {{convert|21|in|mm|}} falls from November through February and only about {{convert|4|in|mm|}} from June through September.<ref name ="NOAA"/> Since temperatures are normally below freezing fewer than 30&nbsp;days a year,<ref name = "5-9">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 5: Stream Flow and Hydrology", p. 9</ref> most of this precipitation reaches the ground as rain. 

Historically, most rain falling on the watershed was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the [[groundwater]] and provided [[Baseflow|baseflow]]s to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54&nbsp;percent of the watershed. Storm [[surface runoff|runoff]] that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.<ref name ="5-9"/>

===Main channel===
Until the 20th&nbsp;century, the slough and its side channels and associated ponds and lakes were part of the active Columbia River floodplain. When the historic river was high, the slough received water from it near Big Four Corners, about {{convert|17|mi|km}} from the slough's mouth.<ref>Portland BES, "Chapter 5: Stream Flow and Hydrology", p. 2</ref>  In 1917, property owners formed three drainage districts&mdash;Peninsula Drainage District No.&nbsp;1 (Pen&nbsp;1), Peninsula Drainage District No.&nbsp;2 (Pen&nbsp;2), and Multnomah County Drainage District No.&nbsp;1 (MCDD)&mdash;to control flooding. A fourth district, the Sandy Drainage Improvement Company (SDIC), formed in 1939 to manage water flow between the east side of Fairview Lake and the Sandy River further east.<ref name ="MCDD history">{{cite web | title = Drainage Districts History | publisher = Multnomah County Drainage District |year=2007 | url = http://www.portlandonline.com/bes/index.cfm?c=36081&a=63585 | accessdate = December 2, 2008}}</ref> By 2008, the districts maintained {{convert|30|mi|km}} of levees as well as water pumps, floodgates and other water control devices.<ref name="about"/> 

[[Image:Upper ColumbiaSlough.jpg|thumb|left|Upper slough just below Fairview Lake]]The upper slough extends from the slough's source at Fairview Lake, roughly {{convert|18.5|mi|km|0}} from the mouth, to a gated levee known as the ''mid-dike levee'' about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} downstream. This sector, managed by MCDD, covers {{convert|2650|acre|ha}} completely surrounded by levees. A northern side channel extends from the mid-dike levee to MCDD Pump Station No.&nbsp;4 on the Columbia River (Marine Drive) levee near Big Four Corners. Water usually exits this sector through the open gates of the mid-dike levee, but to control threatening flows the MCDD can close the gate and pump water from the northern side channel directly into the Columbia. The pump's maximum capacity is {{convert|275000|USgal|L}} per minute.<ref name = "5-6to8">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 5: Stream Flow and Hydrology", pp. 6&ndash;8.</ref> 

The middle slough, also managed by MCDD, lies between the mid-dike levee and the ''Pen&nbsp;2 levee'', {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} from the mouth. This sector covers {{convert|6848|acre|ha}}, is completely surrounded by levees, and contains many side sloughs, ponds, small lakes, and springs. Pump Station No.&nbsp;1 rests on the Pen&nbsp;2 levee, which is gated across the course of the slough. To control flows, MCDD can open or close the gates, and it can pump water from the middle slough to the lower slough when its flow is reversed by the tide or when gravity flow is insufficient. The pump's capacity is 250,000 U.S. gallons per minute (16,000 L/s).<ref name = "5-6to8"/>

Water levels in the lower slough, managed by Pen&nbsp;2 and Pen&nbsp;1, depend more on Willamette River conditions than on pumping by MCDD. Incoming tides cause a variation in water surface elevation of between {{convert|12|in|cm}} and {{convert|24|in|cm|}} roughly twice per day along the entire lower slough. Flow direction varies with the tide. Pen&nbsp;2 and Pen&nbsp;1, separated by Interstate 5, border the north side of the lower slough. Pen 2 manages {{convert|1475|acre|ha}} east of the highway, and Pen&nbsp;1 manages {{convert|901|acre|ha}} to the west (downstream). Multiple pump stations move water from lesser sloughs in both districts into the main slough. Parts of this subwatershed are unprotected by levees and are vulnerable to [[100-year flood]]s.<ref name = "5-6to8"/>

===Creeks and lakes===
[[Image:Smith lake.jpg|thumb|right|Smith Lake from the north shore]] Historically Fairview Creek flowed north into the Columbia River through a wetlands slightly upstream of Big Four Corners. In the early 20th&nbsp;century, water managers dug an artificial channel connecting the Fairview Creek wetlands to the slough. In 1960, they built a dam on the west side of the wetlands to create Fairview Lake for water storage and recreation. It covers about {{convert|100|acre|ha}} and is {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m}} deep. Fairview Creek forms in a wetland near Grant Butte and flows north for {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} through the cities of Gresham and Fairview to reach the lake. Fairview Creek has two named tributaries, No Name Creek, and Clear Creek. A smaller stream, Osborn Creek, also flows into the lake, which empties through a [[weir]] and [[culvert]] system into the upper slough.<ref name ="5-8"/> 

With one exception, the streams feeding Fairview Lake are the watershed's only remaining creeks, although [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s also reach the surface.<ref name ="5-5">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 5: Stream Flow and Hydrology", p. 5.</ref> Wilkes Creek, the slough's only free flowing tributary, is about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} long and enters the upper slough from the south.<ref name ="5-8">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 5: Streamflow and Hydrology", p. 8</ref> Dozens of similar streams that once flowed into the slough from the south have all been piped or filled.<ref name ="5-5"/>

Many bodies of water in addition to the main slough channel lie within the drainage basin. The area around the middle slough contains several slough arms and small lakes, including Buffalo Slough, Whitaker Slough, Johnson Lake, Whitaker Ponds, and Prison Pond.<ref name = "5-6to8"/> In the lower slough, [[Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area]] at {{convert|2000|acre|ha}} is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States.<ref name="Friends">{{cite web | title = The Wetlands | publisher = Friends of Smith and Bybee Lakes | date = 2008 | url = http://www.smithandbybeelakes.org/wildlife.html| accessdate = December 2, 2008}}</ref> A {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} side slough called North Slough connects Bybee Lake and the main slough channel.<ref name = "5-6to8"/> A water control structure at the outlet from Bybee Lake to the North Slough regulates the lakes' levels.<ref name = "5-6to8"/>

===Aquifers and wells===
Groundwater discharges from an [[aquifer]] near the surface supply an estimated flow between {{convert|50|and|100|cuft/s|m3/s}}  to the middle and upper sloughs. Rain infiltration and artificial [[sump]]s recharge this shallow aquifer. Geologists have identified four other major aquifers separated by relatively impermeable clays or other [[Stratum|strata]] at various levels below the surface aquifer. The City of Portland's water bureau manages the Columbia South Shore Well Field that taps the deeper aquifers. As of 2004, 25&nbsp;active wells drawing from depths ranging from {{convert|60|to|600|ft|m}} could produce up to 100&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (380&nbsp;million&nbsp;L) a day from the field. These were drilled between 1976 and 2003 to supplement the city's main water supply from the [[Bull Run Watershed]] during droughts or emergencies. The Rockwood Water People's Utility District (PUD) and the City of Fairview have also drilled three wells near the upper slough.<ref>Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 5: Stream Flow and Hydrology", pp. 14&ndash;17"</ref>

One settler, Lewis Love, became wealthy by cutting timber in the watershed and using the slough as part of a shipping route to downtown Portland.<ref name="BES history"/> Other settlers logged the forests near the slough and built sawmills, fished, and farmed. In 1852, James John operated a ferry based on the peninsula of land between the Columbia and the Willamette River. The community of [[St. Johns, Portland, Oregon|St. Johns]], [[plat]]ted in the same year on the peninsula, is named after him.<ref name = "McArthur St. Johns">{{cite book | last = McArthur | first = Lewis A. | coauthors = McArthur, Lewis L. | title = Oregon Geographic Names, Seventh Edition | publisher = Oregon Historical Society Press | date = 2003 | location = Portland, Oregon | pages = 837&ndash;38 | isbn = 0-87595-277-1}}</ref> Legislation creating the [[Port of Portland (Oregon)|Port of Portland]] in 1891 improved St. Johns' prospects as a Willamette River port.<ref name="BES history"/> In 1902, the U.S. Congress passed a [[Newlands Reclamation Act|Reclamation Act]] that encouraged irrigation, flood control, and wetland development in places like the peninsula.<ref name = "BES history"/> In 1907, the [[Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway]] began work on a rail line across the peninsula.<ref name = "BES history"/> The railway and the port improvements led to high expectations.

===Open sewer===
As Portland grew, it annexed St. Johns and expanded into the peninsula and other parts of the watershed. East of St. Johns, the [[Swift & Company|Swift Meatpacking Company]] bought {{convert|3400|acre|ha}} in 1906 and established the community of [[Kenton, Portland, Oregon|Kenton]]. Other companies built packing plants and [[slaughterhouse]]s along the slough, and by 1911 Portland had become the main livestock market for the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref>{{cite web | title = When Cattle Was King: Kenton | work = Hog Farms and Sewers: Commercial Communities | publisher = Center for Columbia River History| url = http://www.ccrh.org/comm/slough/kenton(1).htm | accessdate = October 19, 2008}}</ref> These and other early 20th&nbsp;century businesses, including stockyards, a dairy farm, a shingle company, and a lumber mill, flushed waste products into the slough.<ref name="Stroud">{{cite journal  | last = Stroud  | first = Ellen  | title = Troubled Waters in Ecotopia: Environmental Racism in Portland, Oregon | journal = Radical History Review | issue = 74 | pages = 65&ndash;95 | publisher = MARHO | location = New York, N.Y. | date = 1999 | url = http://enviro.lclark.edu:8002/servlet/SBReadResourceServlet?rid=1141854451269_1726668621_752 | issn = 0163-6545 | accessdate = October 20, 2008}}</ref> Starting in 1910, north Portland's residential sewage also poured into the slough through pipes laid for the purpose.<ref name="BES history"/>

In 1917, landowners along the slough had formed three drainage districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees to keep the rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because both ends of the canal were at nearly the same elevation.<ref name = "BES history"/>  

Over the next 30&nbsp;years, more lumber and wood products companies opened along the slough, and tugboats moved log rafts up and down the waterway. Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed. The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower slough and built a new [[Portland International Airport|Portland Airport]] on land along the middle slough. Activists and civic leaders, concerned about pollution on the Willamette River, led cleanup campaigns, but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment. Pollution eventually grew so bad on the slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water.<ref name ="BES history"/>

===World War II and after===
After the start of the war with Japan, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed an order for [[internment]] of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. About 1,700&nbsp;of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Livestock Exposition Center]] (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.<ref>{{cite web | title = Survival on the Slough: ''Shikata Na Gai'' | publisher = Center for Columbia River History | url = http://www.ccrh.org/comm/slough/japanese.htm | accessdate = October 22, 2008 }}</ref>

[[File:Vanport flood.NWS.jpg|thumb|left|Floodwater destroyed Vanport in 1948.]] In 1942, [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser Shipbuilding Company]] began making ships for the war at three huge installations near the lower slough, one in St. Johns, one on Swan Island in Portland's [[Overlook, Portland, Oregon|Overlook]] neighborhood, and one in Vancouver, Washington.<ref name = "Maben 1">Maben, p. 1</ref> St. Johns and Vancouver made [[Liberty ship]]s, while Swan Island made [[tanker (ship)|tanker]]s.<ref name = "Maben 1"/> The St. Johns shipyard became the nation's leading producer of Liberty ships.<ref name = "Maben 1"/> To house shipyard workers and their families, [[Henry J.

By 1943, Vanport's population of 39,000 made it the second largest city in Oregon and the largest wartime housing project in the U.S.<ref name="Stroud"/> After the war, the population fell to about 18,500.<ref name="Stroud"/> This was roughly the number of people living there on May 30, 1948, when a flood broke through Vanport's western levee.<ref name="Stroud"/> The break occurred during the afternoon of a day with mild weather.<ref name="Maben 106"/> The first rush of water soon became a "creeping inundation",<ref name ="Maben 106">Maben, p. 106</ref> slowed in its advance for 35 to 40&nbsp;minutes by water-absorbing sloughs.<ref name ="Maben 106"/> The water's gradual rise within the city allowed most of the residents to escape drowning. The county [[coroner]]'s official list of bodies recovered was set at fifteen, and seven people on a list of missing people were never found.<ref>Maben, p. 122</ref> The flood destroyed the city, which was never rebuilt.<ref name="Stroud"/> 

The Vanport flood induced changes to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt and in some cases fortified to withstand a [[100-year flood]]. Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal, the city plugged it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became [[Portland State University]].<ref name="BES history"/>

[[Image:KelleyPointPark tug.jpg|thumb|left|A [[tugboat]] pushes a [[barge]] from the Willamette River into the Columbia River around Kelley Point Park at the tip of the peninsula through which the slough flows.]]Debate about how to use the slough and its watershed continued through the rest of the century. In 1964, the Port of Portland, interested in industrial development, began to fill Smith, Bybee, and Ramsey lakes with [[dredging|dredge]] sands from the Columbia.<ref name="BES history"/> In the 1970s, the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a [[contour line]] {{convert|11|ft|m|}} above [[mean sea level]] except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat.<ref name="BES history"/> Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor [[Tom McCall]] in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough.<ref name="Stroud"/> Some planners argued that the slough was so filthy that more industry was all it was good for. They portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal.<ref name ="Stroud"/>

At Oregon's request, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] stripped the slough of its [[navigable]] status in 1978.<ref name="little"> {{cite web | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=qhPzEmNKE8EC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=40+Mile+Loop&source=web&ots=qVaqz0Bat6&sig=YrE6Knd_4JHEUv_0gknn_ZbdQQQ&hl=en#PPA76,M1 | title = ''Greenways for America'' | last = Little | first = Charles E. | date = 1990 | publisher = John Hopkins University Press |place = Baltimore, Maryland | isbn = 0801851408 | pages = 78 | accessdate = December 9, 2008}}</ref>  This ended channel dredging on the slough, which could then be used for recreation.<ref name="little"/> Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal [[Clean Water Act]] and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act.<ref name="BES history"/> In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used [[urban renewal]] funds to support industrial projects near the airport.<ref name="BES history"/> In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.<ref name = "BES history"/>

[[Image:Columbia slough eastward from N Vancouver Ave with Hwy 99 P3739.jpeg|thumb|Columbia Slough where it is crossed by North Vancouver Avenue. [[Oregon Route 99]] (Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard) crosses on the green bridge.]]
After years of piping raw sewage directly into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system from all over the city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13&nbsp;outfalls.<ref name="BES history"/>

The city closed the St. Johns Landfill, adjacent to the lower slough, in 1991. Pressed by citizen action groups, it agreed in 1993 to establish a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} environmental conservation zone along the slough. In response to a threatened lawsuit, the city began a comprehensive cleanup of the slough in 1994, and a year later it received a $10&nbsp;million grant from the EPA for the purpose.<ref name="BES history"/>

Of the streams monitored in the lower Willamette basin by the [[Oregon Department of Environmental Quality]] (DEQ) between 1986 and 1995, the Columbia Slough had the worst pollution scores. DEQ's measurements came from the slough at Landfill Road, {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} from the mouth. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Columbia Slough was 22, or "very poor". By comparison, the average in the Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years. Measurements of water quality at the Landfill Road site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of [[phosphate]]s, [[ammonia]] and [[nitrate]]s, [[Fecal coliforms|fecal coliform bacteria]], and suspended solids, and a high [[biochemical oxygen demand]].

==Biology==

===Habitat===
Development since 1850 has greatly altered the places in the watershed where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early [[General Land Office]] survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed that all of the watershed provided plant and wildlife [[habitat]] in 1851, but by 2003 only 33&nbsp;percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10&nbsp;percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other [[wetland]]s that had comprised 22&nbsp;percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1&nbsp;percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by [[Rubus armeniacus|Himalayan blackberry]] and other invasive [[species]] and fragmented by roads. The [[riparian zone]] along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.<ref name ="7-6to7"/>

In 2002 the city, the MCDD, and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] began a project to improve habitat by creating {{convert|7|mi|km}} of stream [[meander]]s and wetland terraces along the slough.<ref name ="7-21">Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, "Chapter 7: Physical Habitat and Biological Communities", p. 21</ref> Through its Watershed Revegetation Program, begun in 1996, the city worked with property owners to plant native vegetation and to remove invasive weeds.

===Trails=== 
Next to Columbia River, long segments of the [[40 Mile Loop]] skirt the north edge of the slough watershed, while other segments such as the north-south [[I-205 Bike Path]] cross it or, as in the case of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail, run through it generally along an east-west axis.<ref name = "Loop map">{{cite web |publisher = 40 Mile Loop Land Trust  |title = 40-Mile Loop Trail Map  |url = http://www.40mileloop.org/maps/40MileLoop_map.pdf  |format = pdf  |accessdate = December 9, 2008}}</ref> The 40&nbsp;Mile Loop is a partly-completed [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]] trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]], architects involved in the planning for Portland's [[Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition]] of 1905, it has expanded to a projected {{convert|140|mi|km}}, encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and [[Johnson Creek (Willamette River)|Johnson Creek]].<ref name="Loop Trust"> {{cite web | url = http://www.40mileloop.org/history.htm | title = History of the 40-Mile Loop | publisher = 40-Mile Loop Land Trust |date = 2004 | accessdate = December 9, 2008}}</ref> The parks and other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40&nbsp;Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.<ref name = "Loop map"/>

Along the east side of the slough watershed, the City of Gresham has opened a  {{convert|1.24|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of the Gresham-Fairview Trail, a planned {{convert|5.2|mi|km|adj=on}}, north-south hiking and biking route between the [[Springwater Corridor]] along Johnson Creek and the 40&nbsp;Mile Loop along the Columbia River.<ref name = "open segments">{{cite web | title = Gresham/Fairview Trail Master Plan | publisher = City of Gresham | date = 2008 | url = http://greshamoregon.gov/city/city-departments/environmental-services/parks-and-recreation/template.aspx?id=5826 | accessdate = December 8, 2008}}</ref> On the west side of the watershed, the Peninsula Crossing Trail connects Willamette Cove on the Willamette River in St. Johns with the 40&nbsp;Mile Loop along the Columbia River.<ref name = "Houck"/> This {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} linear hiking and biking trail crosses the lower slough and passes between Smith Lake and Heron Lakes Golf Course.<ref name = "Houck"/> The trail is level and accessible by [[wheelchair]].<ref name = "Houck"/> Amenities include a picnic area, seats carved from [[basalt]], and art installations.<ref name = "Houck"/>

===Boating===
Accessible to canoers and kayakers of all skill levels, the slough is essentially flat. A trip from source to mouth is possible via the main channel but requires [[portage]]s around levees and other obstacles. BES estimates the time required for a canoe trip of roughly {{convert|18|mi|km}} along the main channel to be at least nine hours. Trips along the lower {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} must be timed with the tides to allow paddling with the current. Eight launch sites, including one just below Fairview Lake at the headwaters and another at Kelley Point Park near the mouth, have been established along the slough.<ref name="paddler's map"/>
