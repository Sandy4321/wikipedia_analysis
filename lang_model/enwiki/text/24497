'''Peter Michael Stephan Hacker''' (born [[15 July]][[1939]] in London) is a British philosopher.
His principal expertise is in the [[philosophy of mind]] and
[[philosophy of language]]. He is well known for his detailed
exegesis of the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]][[comma|,]] and his outspoken
criticism of [[Neurophilosophy|neuroscience-based philosophy]].

==Professional biography==

Peter Hacker studied philosophy, politics and economics at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] from 1960-63. In 1963-65 he was senior Scholar at [[St. Antony's College, Oxford]], where he began graduate work under the supervision of Professor [[H. L. A. Hart]]. His D.Phil thesis "Rules and Duties" was completed in 1966 during a Junior Research Fellowship at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

Since 1966 Peter Hacker has been a fellow of [[St. John's College, Oxford]], and of the Oxford University philosophy department. His visiting positions at other universities include [[Makerere College, Uganda]] (1968); [[Swarthmore College]], USA (1973 and 1986); [[University of Michigan]], USA (1974); Milton C. Scott visiting professor at [[Queen's University, Kingston]], Canada (1985). From 1985 to 1987 he was a British Academy Research Reader in the Humanities. In 1991-94 he was a [[Leverhulme Trust]] Senior Research Fellow.

==Philosophical Views==

Peter Hacker is one of the most powerful contemporary exponents of the
linguistic-therapeutic approach to philosophy pioneered by Ludwig Wittgenstein.
In this approach, the words and concepts used by the language community are 
taken as given, and the role of philosophy is to resolve or dissolve philosophical problems
by giving an overview of the uses of these words and the structural
relationships between these concepts.
Philosophical inquiry is therefore very different from scientific inquiry,
and Hacker maintains accordingly that there is
a sharp dividing line between the two:
"Philosophy is not a contribution to human knowledge, but to
human understanding" (quoted from [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Orrery%20of%20intentionality.pdf "An Orrery of Intentionality"]). This has led him into direct disagreement
with "neuro-philosophers": neuroscientists or philosophers such
as [[Antonio Damasio]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] who think that neuroscience
can shed light on philosophical questions such as the nature of
consciousness or the mind-body problem. Hacker
maintains that
these, like all philosophical problems, are not real problems at all,
but mirages arising from conceptual confusion. It follows that
scientific inquiry (learning more facts
about humans or the world) does not help to resolve them.
His 2003 book "Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience",
co-authored with neuroscientist M. Bennett, contains an
exposition of these views, and critiques of the ideas of many
contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers,  including
[[Francis Crick]], [[Antonio Damasio]], [[Daniel Dennett]],
[[John Searle]], and others.

Hacker in
general finds many received components of current philosophy of mind to be
incoherent.  He rejects mind-brain identity theories, as well as
functionalism, eliminativism and other forms of reductionism.  He advocates
methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human
conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in
terms of reasons and goals.  He denies that psychological attributes can be
intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable
only to the human being as a whole.  He has endeavoured to show that the
puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of
the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that
so-called qualia are no more than a philosopher's fiction.

Hacker frequently collaborated with fellow Oxford philosopher [[G. P. Baker]].
