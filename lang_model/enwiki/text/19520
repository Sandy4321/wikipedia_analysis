The '''Presidio Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora de Loreto de la Bah<U+00ED>a''', known more commonly as '''Presidio La Bahia''', or simply '''La Bahia''' is a [[fort]] constructed by the [[Spanish Army]] that became the nucleus of the city of [[Goliad, Texas]], United States. Originally founded in 1721 on the ruins of the failed French [[Fort Saint Louis (Texas)|Fort Saint Louis]], the presidio was moved to a location on the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] in 1726.  In 1747, the presidio and its mission were moved to their current location on the [[San Antonio River]].  By 1770, the presidio had been rebuilt in stone and had become "the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River".<ref name=roell15>Roell (1994), p. 15.</ref>  A civilian settlement, modern-day Goliad, sprang up around the presidio in the late 18th century, and the area was one of the three most important in [[Spanish Texas]].

The presidio was captured by insurgents twice during the [[Mexican War of Independence]], by the [[Republican Army of the North]] in 1813 and by the [[Long Expedition]] in 1821.  Each time the insurgents were later defeated by Spanish troops.  By the end of 1821 Texas became part of the newly formed [[United Mexican States]]. La Bahia was one of the two major garrisons in [[Mexican Texas]] and lay halfway between [[San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar]] (the political center of Texas) and [[Copano, Texas|Copano]], the major port in Texas.  In October 1835, days after the beginning of the [[Texas Revolution]], a group of [[Texian]] insurgents marched on La Bahia.  After a 30-minute battle, the Mexican garrison surrendered and the Texians gained control of the presidio, which they soon renamed '''Fort Defiance'''.

During the [[siege of the Alamo]], Texian commander [[William B. Travis]] several times asked La Bahia commander [[James Fannin]] to bring reinforcements.  Although Fannin and his men attempted a relief mission, they abandoned the attempt the following day. After the [[Battle of the Alamo|fall of the Alamo]], General [[Sam Houston]] ordered Fannin to abandon La Bahia.  He did so on March 19, but took a leisurely path and the La Bahia garrison was captured and imprisoned in the presidio.  On March 27 the Texian captives were marched from the presidio and executed, in an event known as the [[Goliad Massacre]].

Today, La Bahia is the best-preserved Spanish [[presidio]] in the United States.

==Origins==
Although Spain claimed control over the area now known as [[Texas]], until the late 17th century the province was largely ignored.<ref>Chipman (1992), p. 26.</ref>  In an attempt to take advantage of Spain's disinterest, in 1685 France authorized [[Robert de La Salle]] to organize a colony in the area between [[New Spain]] and [[Florida]].  Although La Salle intended to locate his colony along the [[Mississippi River]], poor maps and improper navigation decisions led the colonists to instead land near [[Matagorda Bay]] in [[Spanish Texas]].<ref name="weber149">Weber (1992), p. 149.</ref>  Believing the French colony was a threat to Spanish mines and shipping routes, Spanish King [[Carlos II|Carlos II's]] Council of War recommended that "Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'"<ref name="weber149">Weber (1992), p. 149.</ref>  After several years of searching, a Spanish expedition finally located the site of [[French colonization of Texas|Fort Saint Louis]] in early 1689.  Several months earlier, [[Karankawa]] Indians had destroyed the fort, killing most of the colonists.<ref name="chipman83">Chipman (1992), p. 83.</ref>  The Spanish expedition burned the remains of the French fort and buried the French cannons.<ref name="weber153">Weber (1992), p. 153.</ref>

The leader of the expedition, [[Alonso De Le<U+00F3>n]], recommended that Spanish authorities establish [[presidio]]s along the [[Rio Grande]], the [[Frio River]], and the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]].  Due to a shortage of funds, the Spanish government chose not to establish any presidios.<ref name=chipman88>Chipman (1992), p. 88.</ref>  From 1691 until 1693 several Spanish missions struggled in [[East Texas]], but they finally failed, leaving Texas again ignored by Spain.<ref name="weber155">Weber (1992), p. 155.</ref>

In the subsequent decades France established a presence in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], causing the Spanish to fear that France could become a threat to other Spanish areas.<ref name="weber160">Weber (1992), pp. 159&ndash;160.</ref>   In 1716, Spain re-established missions in East Texas, this time accompanied by a presidio.<ref name=chipman111>Chipman (1992), p. 111.</ref><ref name=chipman112>Chipman (1992), p. 112.</ref>  After difficulties with France during the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance]] in 1719&ndash;1720, Spain became determined to increase their military presence in Texas.<ref>Weber (1992), pp. 165<U+2013>166.</ref>  In 1721, the [[Marquis de San Miguel de Aguayo]], governor of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Texas and Coahuila]], founded Presidio La Bahia on the site of the former French fort.<ref name=weber168>Weber (1992), p. 168.</ref>  Nearby they established a mission, [[Mission Nuestra Se<U+00F1>ora del Esp<U+00ED>ritu Santo de Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga|Esp<U+00ED>ritu Santo de Z<U+00FA><U+00F1>iga]] (also known as La Bahia), for the Coco, Karankawa, and Cujane Indians.  Ninety&nbsp;men were left at the garrison.<ref name=chipman126>Chipman (1992), p. 126.</ref> 

The priests at the nearby mission were unable to find an effective means to convince the Karankawa to submit to mission life or Catholic teachings.  In April 1725 they requested that the mission be moved to a more favorable location.  The following year, both mission and presidio were relocated {{convert|26|mi|km}} inland, along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] in what is now [[Victoria County, TX|Victoria County]].<ref name=roell11>Roell (1994), p. 11.</ref>  For the next 23&nbsp;years the mission and presidio remained in this location.<ref name=roell12>Roell (1994), p. 12.</ref>

==Establishment on the San Antonio River==
In 1747, the Spanish government sent [[Jos<U+00E9> de Escand<U+00F3>n]] to inspect the northern frontier of the North American colonies.  Escand<U+00F3>n assigned La Bahia's captain, Joaqu<U+00ED>n Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra, to evaluate [[South Texas]].  On reading Orobio's report, Escand<U+00F3>n recommended that La Bahia be moved from its Guadalupe River location to the banks of the [[San Antonio River]], so that it would be more capable of assisting settlements along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref name=roell13>Roell (1994), p. 13.</ref>  Both the presidio and the mission likely moved in October 1749.  Escand<U+00F3>n proposed that 25&nbsp;Mexican families be relocated near the presidio to form a civilian settlement but was unable to find enough willing settlers.<ref name=roell14>Roell (1994), p. 14.</ref>

In February 1750, the new presidio was under the command of Captain Manuel Ram<U+00ED>rez de la Piszena.  Piszena had personally paid for a stone house to be built for himself, and the 50&nbsp;soldiers in the garrison lived either in a large barracks or in one of 40 temporary wood homes that had been built for those with families.  A chapel had also been built for the presidio.  The presidio was fortified with six 8-lb cannon.  Soldiers alternated guard duty at the presidio and the mission; others were assigned to guard the presidio horses or to protect supply trains coming from the Rio Grande or [[San Antonio de B<U+00E9>xar]] from attacks by [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]] raiding parties.<ref name=roell14/>

With the conclusion of the [[Seven Years War]] in 1767, France ceded Louisiana, and French claims to Texas, to Spain.<ref>Weber (1992), p. 198.</ref>  With France no longer a threat to Spain's North American interests, the Spanish monarchy commissioned the Marquis de Rubi to inspect all of the presidios on the northern frontier of New Spain and make recommendations for the future.<ref name=chipman173>Chipman (1992), p. 173.</ref>  Rubi recommended that several presidios be closed, but that La Bahia be kept and rebuilt in stone.  La Bahia was soon ""the only Spanish fortress for the entire Gulf Coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande to the Mississippi River".<ref name=roell15>Roell (1994), p. 15.</ref>  The presidio now sat at the heart of several major trade and military routes.  It quickly became one of the three most important areas in Texas, alongside B<U+00E9>xar and [[Nacogdoches, TX|Nacogdoches]].<ref name=roell15/>  A civil settlement, now known as [[Goliad, TX|Goliad]] soon developed near the presidio.  By 1804 the settlement had one of only two schools in Texas.<ref name=roell19>Roell (1994), p. 19.</ref>

==Mexican Independence==
The [[Mexican War of Independence]] began in 1810 at the instigation of [[Miguel Hidalgo]].<ref>Owsley (1997), p. 40.</ref>  At the end of November, Texas governor [[Manuel Mar<U+00ED>a de Salcedo]] received notice that Hidalgo and his confederates [[Ignacio Allende]] and [[Juan Aldama]] were expected to invade Texas, and that Salcedo was expected to capture them.<ref>Almar<U+00E1>z (1971), p. 109.</ref> On January 2, 1812, Salcedo summoned troops throughout Texas to Bexar, leaving La Bahia with a minimal force.<ref>Almar<U+00E1>z (1971), p. 115.</ref> Mexican revolutionary [[Bernardo Guti<U+00E9>rrez de Lara]] had been in the United States organizing support for the revolution.  In early August 1812 his recruits, calling themselves the [[Republican Army of the North]], invaded Texas.<ref>Almar<U+00E1>z (1971), p. 159.</ref> In November, Salcedo led Spanish Army forces to the Guadalupe River to ambush the Republican Army of the North.    One of the soldiers was captured, however, and revealed details of the ambush.  The invading army turned south to avoid the trap and quickly captured Presidio La Bahia.  Salcedo promptly began a siege of the fort.<ref>Almar<U+00E1>z (1971), p. 164.</ref>  The siege lasted four months, with occasional skirmishes.<ref name=roell20>Roell (1994), p. 20.</ref>  
Unable to win a decisive victory, Salcedo lifted the siege on February 19, 1813 and turned towards San Antonio de Bexar.<ref>Almar<U+00E1>z (1971), p. 168.</ref> The rebels remained in control of the presidio until July or August 1813, when [[Jos<U+00E9> Joaqu<U+00ED>n de Arredondo]] led royalist troops in retaking all of Texas.<ref name=roell21>Roell (1994), p. 21.</ref>  A member of the Republican Army of the North, Henry Perry, led forces back to Texas in 1817 and attempted to recapture La Bahia.  The presidio was reinforced by soldiers from San Antonio, and Perry and his men were defeated on June 18 near Coleto Creek.<ref name=roell21>Roell (1994), p. 21.</ref>

La Bahia was again the target of invaders in 1821.  After the United States and Spain signed the [[Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty]], giving all rights to Texas to Spain, many Americans were angry.  On October 4, the 52&nbsp;members of the [[Long Expedition]] captured La Bahia.  Four days later, Colonel Ignacio P<U+00E9>rez arrived with troops from Bexar; Long surrendered.<ref name=roell23>Roell (1994), p. 23.</ref>  By the end of 1821, Mexico had achieved independence from Spain, and Texas became part of the newly created country.<ref>Weber (1992), p. 300.</ref>

==Texas Revolution==
===Battle of Goliad===
{{main|Battle of Goliad}}
[[Image:Fort Independence (Goliad) 1836.jpg|right|thumb|This map of the presidio was drawn in 1836.]]
By 1835, La Bahia was one of two major garrisons within [[Mexican Texas]], alongside the [[Alamo Mission|Alamo]] at Bexar.<ref name=scott19>Scott (2003), p. 19.</ref>  Bexar was the political center of Texas, and La Bahia lay halfway between it and the major Texas port of [[Copano, Texas|Copano]].<ref name=scott18>Scott (2003), p. 18.</ref>  Within days of the opening of the [[Texas Revolution]] in October 1835, members of the Texian militia in [[Matagorda, TX|Matagorda]] decided to march on La Bahia to kidnap Mexican General [[Mart<U+00ED>n Perfecto de Cos]].<ref name=hardin14>Hardin (1994), p. 14.</ref>  Other Texas settlers flocked to the march, bringing the number of [[Texian]] volunteers to approximately 125&nbsp;men.  Although the Texians learned that Cos had already departed La Bahia to travel to Bexar, they continued their march.<ref name=hardin15/> 
<ref name=hardin15>Hardin (1994), p. 15.</ref>  Several of the Tejanos who lived near Goliad joined the Texian force, reporting that Colonel Juan L<U+00F3>pez Sandoval commanded only 50&nbsp;men, far fewer than the number necessary to defend the entire perimeter of the presidio.<ref name=scott19>Scott (2000), p. 19.</ref><ref name=hardin16>Hardin (1994), p. 16.</ref> 

In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked the presidio.<ref name=hardin16/>  The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.<ref name=scott20>Scott (2000), p. 20.</ref> The Mexican soldiers opened fire, hitting Samuel McCulloch, a freed slave, in the shoulder.<ref name=hardin16/>  Texians returned fire for approximately 30&nbsp;min.  During a pause in the fighting, a Texian spokesperson yelled out that the Texians would "massacre everyone of you, unless you come out immediately and surrender."<ref name=hardin17>Hardin (1994), p. 17.</ref>  The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered.<ref name=hardin17/>

Over the next several days, more Texian settlers joined the group at La Bahia.  [[Stephen F. Austin]], the commander-in-chief of the newly formed [[Texian Army]], ordered that 100&nbsp;men remain at La Bahia, under the command of [[Philip Dimmitt]], while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Bexar.<ref name=handbook/>  Texian troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort.  Although they found 300&nbsp;muskets, most of them were broken and unable to be repaired.<ref name=scott20/><ref name=hardin17/>  The food, clothing, blankets, and other provisions were valued at $10,000.<ref name=scott20/>  For the next three months, the provisions were parcelled out among companies in the Texian Army.<ref name=handbook>{{citation|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|title=Goliad Campaign of 1835|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/GG/qdg1.html|accessdate=2008-07-14|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]}}</ref> The Texians also gained control of several cannon.<ref name=scott21>Scott (2000), p. 21.</ref>

===Battle of the Alamo support===
{{main|Battle of the Alamo}}
[[Image:JamesWFannin.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Fannin]]]]
At some point, Colonel [[James Fannin]] became the commander of the troops at La Bahia.  He renamed the presidio Fort Defiance.<ref name=handbookGoliad>{{Citation |last=Roell|first=Craig|title=''Battle of Coleto''|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/CC/qec1.html|publisher=Handbook of Texas|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> In February 1836, President [[Antonio L<U+00F3>pez de Santa Anna]] led a large force of [[Mexican Army]] troops into Texas to quell the revolution.  Santa Anna and part of his force entered Bexar on February 23 and initiated a [[siege of the Alamo]].  Alamo commander [[William B. Travis]] immediately sent a courier to Fannin, asking him to provide reinforcements to the Alamo.<ref>Nofi (1992), p. 78.</ref>  At first unable to make up his mind, Fannin finally decided to ride to the relief of the Alamo.<ref name=edmondson324/> Historian Robert Scott suggests that the trip was initiated after Fannin's objections were overridden by his officers.<ref name=scott99>Scott (2000), p. 99.</ref>  On the morning of February 26, he set out with 320&nbsp;men, 4&nbsp;cannon, and several supply wagons for the {{convert|90|mi|km}} march from Goliad to the Alamo.<ref name=edmondson324/> The Goliad garrison had no horses to move the wagons and artillery and were forced to rely on oxen.<ref name=todish44>Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 44.</ref> Barely {{convert|200|yd|m}} into their journey, one of the wagons broke down, and the expedition stopped for repairs.<ref name=edmondson324>Edmondson (2000), p. 324.</ref> The group then took six hours to cross the waist-deep water of the San Antonio River. By the time they reached the other side it was dark, and the men camped along the river. The cold front reached Goliad that evening, and the poorly-dressed soldiers were "quickly chilled and miserable" in the driving rain.<ref name=scott100>Scott (2000), p. 100.</ref> On awakening, Fannin realized that all of the Texian oxen had wandered off, and that his men had neglected to pack food for the journey.<ref name=edmondson328>Edmondson (2000), p. 328.</ref> It took most of the day for the men to round up the oxen; after two days of travel, Fannin's men had not even ventured {{convert|1|mi|km}} from their fort.<ref name=nofi95>Nofi (1992), p. 95.</ref> In a letter to Acting Governor James Robinson, Fannin said that his officers approached him to ask that the rescue trip be cancelled, as they had received word that General Urrea's army was marching towards Goliad.<ref name=scott100/>  The officers and men in the expedition claimed that Fannin decided on his own to abort the mission. Several of the men agreed with the decision, with Dr. Barnard writing in his journal, "With but three or four hundred men, mostly on foot, with but a limited supply of provisions, to march a distance of nearly one-hundred miles through uninhabited country for the purpose of relieving a fortress beleaguered by five-thousand men was madness!"<ref name=scott101>Scott (2000), p. 101.</ref>

===Goliad Massacre===
{{main|Goliad Massacre}}
{{see|Battle of Coleto}}
After learning of the [[Battle of the Alamo|fall of the Alamo]], General [[Sam Houston]] ordered Fannin and his men to abandon La Bahia and fall back to Victoria.  They began the retreat on March 19, carrying with them nine pieces of artillery but little food or water.  Fannin showed no signs of haste, and on the banks of Coleto Creek Mexican General [[Jos<U+00E9> de Urrea]] and his men attacked.  Although the Texians initially repulsed the attacks, they soon ran out of water and Fannin surrendered.<ref name=handbookGoliad/>

The Texians were escorted back to La Bahia, arriving by March 22.  Although Urrea requested that Santa Anna treat the prisoners with clemency, on March 27 the men were marched from the fort and executed by Mexican soldiers, in an event known as the [[Goliad Massacre]].<ref name=handbookGoliad/>

==Restoration==
In the 1960s, local philanthropist Kathryn O'Connor donated $1 million to restore the presidio.  Construction took place between 1963 and 1968, under the oversight of architect Raiford Stripling.  The building was essentially rebuilt from the ground up to look exactly as it had originally.<ref name=Mason78>Mason (1974), p. 78.</ref> In his ''Spanish Missions of Texas'', Herbert Malloy Mason remarked that the presidio was one of "the finest examples of 
Spanish ecclesiastical building on the North American continent".<ref name=mason71>Mason (1974), p. 71.</ref>
