'''Herbert Rowse Armstrong''' (1870 <U+2013> 31 May 1922), is the only [[solicitor]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to have been [[hanged]] for [[murder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/web/crime-museum-uk/episode-guide/the-poisoners/ |title=Crime Museum UK - Discovery Channel The Poisoners

==Early life and career==
Armstrong was born in 1870 to a family of modest means in [[Newton Abbot]], [[Devon]]. He studied at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]],<ref>{{Venn|id=ARMN887HR|name=Armstrong, Herbert Rowse}}</ref> gaining a degree in law, and qualified as a [[solicitor]] in 1895.<ref name = Stratford>{{cite web |url=http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/hr_armstrong.htm
|title=Herbert Rowse Armstrong |publisher=www.stephen-stratford.co.uk |accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref> Initially practising in Newton Abbot and Liverpool, he successfully applied for a vacancy in  [[Hay-on-Wye]] in 1906. He married Katharine Mary Friend the following year; the couple would have two girls and a boy. Armstrong was a hard working man and rose in the social community of the town. He was a leading member of the [[Freemasons]] and was appointed [[Magistrates'_Court#Legal_adviser|Clerk to the Justices]]. He joined the county volunteer forces and rose to the rank of Captain. In 1914 he was called up to fight in the [[First World War]], where he eventually gained the rank of "Major" in the regular army, and he was usually referred to as "Major Armstrong".

==Death of Mrs Armstrong==
In 1919 Kate's health began to weaken with a case of [[nephritis]]. At first she was improving but suddenly began to weaken again. Armstrong kept in close contact with the local physician, Dr. Thomas Hincks, and showed great concern for his wife. Hincks found that Kate was showing signs of mental collapse and came to the conclusion that it was connected to her illness. Kate was admitted to hospital, where she began to improve, but shortly after her return home her condition deteriorated and she died on 22&nbsp;February 1921.

==Attempted murder==

[[Oswald Martin]] was Armstrong's only rival solicitor in Hay. They were each representing parties in a lawsuit that ended with Armstrong's client losing and having to pay a large sum to Martin's client. Martin kept mentioning the matter of payment to Armstrong, but the latter repeatedly delayed the payment date. Armstrong eventually invited Martin to a meeting at his home on 26&nbsp;October 1921. Martin found tea laid out with cakes and buttered scones. The two men discussed the date for payment while dining, during which Armstrong picked up a scone, said "Excuse my fingers"<ref>{{cite book |title= Encyclopedia of Murder|last= Wilson|first= Colin|authorlink= |coauthors= Patricia Pitman|year= 1984|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0330283006|oclc= |page= 60|pages= |url= |accessdate=24 September 2009}}</ref> and handed it to Martin, who ate it. Later, having not arrived at any date agreement, Martin left, and shortly afterwards became very ill.

Martin's father-in-law, John Davies, the chemist (pharmacist) for Hay, was suspicious of Martin's sudden illness, and Dr Hincks became struck by how similar it was to the symptoms he had seen in Katharine Armstrong. Hincks, Martin, and Davies discussed the situation and the latter learned of Armstrong's tea party, at which point he remembered that Armstrong took care of his home's lawns with weed killer and [[arsenic]].

It was subsequently discovered that a few weeks before the tea party, a box of chocolates had been anonymously sent to the Martins. Martin's sister-in-law had eaten some and become violently ill. Fortunately, some chocolates remained and when examined were found to have a small nozzle-like hole in the base. The three contacted Scotland Yard and explained what had happened to Martin, as well as their suspicions about Mrs Armstrong's death. Samples of the chocolates and Martin's [[vomiting|emesis]] were examined and found to contain arsenic.  

Scotland Yard had to move slowly so as not to warn Armstrong of their suspicions. They eventually arrested him on 31&nbsp;December 1921, and he was charged with the attempted murder of Martin. When he was arrested, the police found a packet of arsenic in his pocket and many more in his house. Mrs Armstrong's body was [[exhumed]] and examined by [[Bernard Spilsbury]]. Her body revealed high levels of arsenic.

==Trial==

In the trial, before Mr. Justice [[Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling|Charles Darling]], he was defended by Sir [[Henry Curtis Bennett]], one of the leading criminal trial barristers of the 1920s.  A year earlier there had been a trial near Hay of another solicitor, [[Harold Greenwood (solicitor)|Harold Greenwood]], for the murder of his wife by poison, supposedly disguised as an illness.  Greenwood had been acquitted. Also, the fact that the three men who brought the charges to the police included Armstrong's business rival and the latter's father-in-law looked suspicious.<ref>Jones, Frank. ''Beyond Suspicion: True Stories of Unexpected Killers''. Toronto: Key Porter Books, c1992. ISBN 1-55013-278-4 p.53-85</ref>

However, Armstrong had to explain his habits concerning arsenic. He claimed that it was his practice to put small portions of arsenic into individual pouches, which he squirted into the ground near spots where [[dandelions]] tended to grow. One small pouch was found on his person following his arrest, but there was no reasonable explanation offered for his carrying it around, particularly since the arrest was in December. Armstrong did not come off well in a cross-examination by Mr. Justice Darling concerning this point.

In April 1922 Armstrong was found guilty of the murder of his wife at [[Hereford]]. On 16&nbsp;May 1922, the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] dismissed Armstrong's [[appeal]] and he was [[execute]]d at [[Gloucester Prison]] on 31 May 1922. Reportedly, before the trap was opened on the gallows the Major called out, "I am coming Katie!"<ref>Laurence, John. ''A History of Capital Punishment''. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1930. p.131</ref>

Two motives subsequently emerged for Katharine Armstrong's poisoning. The major had decided he wanted a different wife, and was actually romancing several while Katharine was in her forced decline. Secondly, Katharine had written a will in 1917 leaving the bulk of her estate not to her husband, but to their children. Armstrong produced a new will following his wife's death, giving him control of her estate, but it was later found to be forged. Apparently the major was in financial difficulties, and his reluctance to pay Martin was due to him having speculated with his client's funds.

==Media adaptations==

The Armstrong case was dramatised on the [[BBC]] radio series ''[[The Black Museum]]'' in 1952 under the title of ''The Champagne Glass''.

It was also the subject of a 1994 TV mini-series called ''[[Dandelion Dead]]'', which starred [[Michael Kitchen]] as Major Armstrong, [[Sarah Miles]] as Katherine Armstrong, [[David Thewlis]] as Oswald Martin and [[Lesley Sharp]] as Martin's wife. It was directed by [[Mike Hodges]] and won a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] in 1995. As well as telling the main story of Major Armstrong's crimes, the series develops the courtship of Martin and his wife and shows the effects of events on Armstrong's children.

With elements of the Crippen case, [[Francis Iles]] created his novel of murder in a country village, ''[[Malice Aforethought]]'', making the killer a doctor like Crippen and having the murder scheme unravelled by a second murder plot.

''[[Deadly Advice]]'', a black comedy released in 1994, was set in Hay-on-Wye and had [[Jane Horrocks]] becoming a serial killer under the ghostly influence of Armstrong (played by [[Edward Woodward]]) and others like [[Dr. Crippen]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]) and [[Jack the Ripper]] ([[John Mills]]).
