"'''Train Kept A-Rollin''''" (or "'''The Train Kept A-Rollin''''") is a song first recorded by American [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]] musician [[Tiny Bradshaw]] in 1951.  Originally performed in the style of a [[jump blues]], it has been reworked into a "classic [[Ostinato#riff|guitar riff]] song for the ages".<ref name="Koda AM review">

}}</ref>  Bradshaw borrowed lyrics from an earlier song and set them to an upbeat shuffle arrangement that inspired other musicians to perform and record it. [[The Rock and Roll Trio|Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio]] made an important contribution in 1956 by adding a prominent three-note minor key repeating guitar line to the song.  Although the actual guitar player has been questioned, his contribution has been seen as one of the first uses of an intentionally [[guitar distortion|distorted guitar]] in rock music.  

In 1965, [[the Yardbirds]] popularized the song as an early [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[blues rock]] song, due largely to [[Jeff Beck]]'s [[Effects unit#Types|fuzz-toned]] guitar work. Theirs soon became the most copied arrangement with recordings by a variety of musicians.  After guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] joined the group, the Yardbirds recorded an updated version with new lyrics as "Stroll On" for the film ''[[Blowup]]'' in 1966.  With a highly charged rhythm section and a dual lead guitar attack by Beck and Page, it is seen as a forerunner to [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].  

When the Yardbirds broke up in 1968, "Train Kept A-Rollin'" was adopted as a concert opener by Page's new band, [[Led Zeppelin]], during its early (and again later) touring years.  The song also became an important part of [[Aerosmith]]'s early live repertoire and in 1974, they recorded it for their [[Get Your Wings|second album]].  Their version is actually a two-part song <U+2014> the first has a slower, groove-oriented arrangement, while the second uses that of the Yardbirds.  Aerosmith turned it into a [[hard rock]] standard and a staple of [[classic rock]] radio; it remains one of their most popular tunes.  "Train Kept A-Rollin'" has been performed and recorded by numerous other artists.

==Original song==
Tiny Bradshaw and his band first recorded "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" in 1951.  Music researcher Peter Grendysa calls it a "jump opus"<ref name="Grendsya p4">Grendsya 1992, p. 4.</ref> and Birnbaum describes it as "a vibrant mid-tempo song with a [[boogie-woogie bass]] line and a shuffling drumbeat".<ref name="Birnbaum p34">Birnbaum 2012, p. 34.</ref>  The introductory section of the song features [[scat singing]] by Bradshaw answered by a chorus.  His lyrics, with early [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|jazz hipster]] references, are delivered in Bradshaw's "hearty, grainy" vocal:<ref name="Birnbaum p34"/>
:I caught the train I met a real dame, she was a hipster and a gone dame
:She was pretty from New York City, and she trucked on down the ol' fair lane 
:With a heave and a ho, and I just couldn't let her go&nbsp;... 
:The train kept a rollin' all night long, and I still wouldn't let her go
[[Image:Tiny Bradshaw.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tiny Bradshaw in 1942.]]

Bradshaw based his song on "[[Cow-Cow Boogie]]", a 1942 song about a singing cowboy.<ref name="Birnbaum p35">Birnbaum 2012, p. 35.</ref>  He rewrote lines such as "a ditty he learned in the city" and "get along, get hip little doggies, and he trucked 'em on down the old fairway" to meet his new scenario.<ref name="Birnbaum p35"/>  Although the King Records single lists "Bradshaw-Mann" as the songwriters, reissues and subsequent recordings of "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" credit Tiny Bradshaw, [[Lois Mann]] (a pseudonym of [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] owner [[Syd Nathan]]), and Howard Kay.  [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], the performing rights organization, lists the songwriters/composers as "Myron C. Bradshaw, Sydney Nathan, and Howard Kay".<ref>

The recording session took place on October 6, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio.

It was reviewed by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, which commented using jump parlance: "The singer comes thru{{sic}} with a great vocal on a rockin' novelty, with some solid chorus and ork [orchestra aka swing band] backing.  Tune builds all the way.  Platter could catch a lot of change."<ref>

In 1956, Johnny Burnette and the Rock and Roll Trio reworked Bradshaw's song using a rockabilly/early rock and roll arrangement.  The Trio's version features guitar lines in what many historians consider to be the first recorded example of intentionally distorted guitar in rock music,<ref name="Rockabilly">Gordon 2011, p. 99.</ref> although blues guitarists, such as [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]]<ref>Palmer 1981, p. 235.</ref><ref> Morris 1991, p. 6.</ref> and [[Pat Hare]],<ref>Palmer 1981, pp. 237<U+2013>238.</ref><ref>Escott 1990, p. 2.</ref> had recorded with the same effect years earlier.

The Trio's guitarist, [[Paul Burlison]], explained that he noticed the sound after accidentally dropping his amplifier, which dislodged a power tube.<ref name="Forte">Forte 1991, pp. 2<U+2013>3</ref> Later, "whenever I wanted to get that sound, I'd just reach back and loosen that tube".<ref name="Forte"/>  He utilized this effect with the song's main instrumental feature, a "repeated three-note minor key [guitar] riff".<ref>Birnbaum 2012, p. 32.</ref>  Burlison recounted how he came up with the signature riff:
{{cquote|[I was] in the dressing room with the loose tube. Johnny [Burnett] was playing an E chord and I was playing in a G position but I'd take my fingers off and play in octaves [using the thumb and middle or index finger]. He wasn't singing 'The Train Kept A-Rollin'<nowiki>'</nowiki>, it was another song, and I got to doing ''doom diddle doom daddle doom daddle''&nbsp;... [Later] I told Owen Bradley about it at the Barn, where we cut the stuff, and he said, 'let me hear it'.  So I started doing it and he said, 'Well, let's do it'.<ref>Gordon 2011, p. 97.</ref>}}

Later, authors Gordon and DijkemaIt argued that the guitar sound on "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" could be created with "normal distortion for the time period", i.e., a highly-[[Distortion (music)#Valve overdrive|overdriven]] early 1950s guitar amplifier.<ref name="Rockabilly"/><ref>Similar "damaged amplifier" claims have been made, including by blues/R&B guitarist Willie Kizart, whose distorted guitar sound for the 1951 [[Jackie Brenston]]/[[Ike Turner]] hit "[[Rocket 88]]" also has been cited as an early example of deliberate distortion. Palmer 1981, p. 222.</ref> They noted "only the low E string is distorted" with "pretty clean treble strings", whereas with a tube malfunction, all strings would be distorted; the sound could be achieved with the pole piece for the low E string raised "as much as possible without making the string unplayable", thereby allowing it to overload the amplifier more than the treble strings.<ref name="Rockabilly"/> They also argue that Nashville session guitarist [[Grady Martin]] provided the guitar parts for the Trio's recording; they base this on stylistic and technical qualities, since, at the time, Martin was a more accomplished player than Burlison, and these qualities are apparent in his work on other recordings.<ref name="Rockabilly"/>

English rock group the Yardbirds recorded "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" during their first American tour in 1965.  It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but their "propulsive, power-driven version, however, deviated radically from the original&nbsp;... [their] recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity and turned it into a classic among classics".<ref name="Carson">Carson 2001, p. 44.</ref>  The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, claims that he introduced the song the group, "They just heard me play the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it".<ref name="Birnbaum p32">Birnbaum 2012, p. 32.</ref>  [[Giorgio Gomelsky]], the group' first producer, states that [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]'s use of [[blues harp]] to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.<ref>Birnbaum 2012, p. 31.  The author also writes that an earlier 1965 version by [[Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages]] "has little in common with the Yardbirds' version", which lacks the Rock and Trio's signature guitar riff.</ref>  

The song opens with Beck using volume swells on an overdriven guitar to simulate a train whistle and the band launches into the song with rhythm guitarist [[Chris Dreja]], bassist [[Paul Samwell-Smith]], and Beck all following the riff from the Rock and Roll Trio's song.<ref name="Russo">Russo 1998, p. 29.</ref> Two combined takes of [[Keith Relf]]'s vocal, with some differences in the lyrics, come in after twelve-bars.<ref name="Russo"/>  Following the vocal section, the rhythm changes to a shuffle and a 12-bar harmonica and guitar bridge sets the stage for Beck's first solo.  After returning to the original rhythm for another double-tracked vocal section, a brief "rave up"-style section precedes Beck's second solo.<ref name="Birnbaum p30"/>  "Rave up" is used to describe a middle instrumental section of a song, when the beat shifts into double-time and the instrumental improvisation gradually builds to a climax. It was the Yardbirds' signature sound and is usually attributed to bass player Paul Samwell-Smith;<ref>The middle sections of the Yardbirds' hits "[[For Your Love]]",  "[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)#The Yardbirds versions|I'm a Man]]", and "[[Shapes of Things]]" also feature brief "rave ups".</ref> Birnbaum has identified it as "representing some of the earliest psychedlic blues-rock, antedating [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]]".<ref name="Birnbaum p30"/>  Beck's second guitar solo, which extends for two 12-bar sections, features an early use of a fuzz-tone [[Distortion (music)|distortion]] [[effects pedal]].<ref name="Koda AM review"/>  His work on the song has been described as "incendiary"<ref name="Birnbaum p30"/> with his "riveting, relatively complex solos"<ref name="Birnbaum p32"/> making the Yardbirds' rendition the new standard on which "practically all of the many [subsequent] covers of 'The Train Kept A-Rollin'<nowiki>'</nowiki> are modeled".<ref>Birnbaum 2012, p. 33.</ref>

The song was recorded by [[Sam Phillips]] at his [[Phillips Recording]] studio in Memphis, Tennessee September 12, 1965, with further recording by [[Roy Halee]] at Columbia Recording Studio in New York City September 21 and 22, 1965.<ref>Gomelsky has stated that the song was recorded entirely at CBS in New York. Gomelsky 2002, p. 36.</ref>  "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" was included on studio side of the Yardbirds' second American album ''[[Having a Rave Up]]'', which was issued on November 15, 1965. The song, along with another American studio recording, "[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)#The Yardbirds versions|I'm a Man]]", was not released in the UK until the mid-1970s, well after the group had disbanded.  The song was a staple of the band's concerts and they recorded several live versions with Beck, which appear on albums such as ''[[BBC Sessions (The Yardbirds album)|BBC Sessions]]'' and ''Glimpses 1963<U+2013>1968''.

In June 1966, bassist Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds to become a record producer.  His initial replacement, well-known studio guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], soon switched to guitar with second guitarist Dreja taking over on bass. With both Beck and Page on board, the Yardbirds had one of the first dual lead guitar teams in popular rock.  Movie director [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] saw the group's September 23, 1966 performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London and, being impressed with their version of the song, requested that they perform "Train Kept A-Rollin'" for his upcoming film ''[[Blowup]]''.<ref name ="Shadwick">Shadwick 2005, p. 12.</ref>  Less than two weeks later, the group entered the [[Sound Techniques]] studios in London, where they recorded on October 3<U+2013>5, 1966.<ref>Clayson 2002, p. 182.</ref>  Unable to secure the movie performance rights from the song's publisher, singer Keith Relf wrote new lyrics, re-named it "Stroll On", and included credits to the five band members.<ref>Koda 2001, p. 46.</ref>  The Yardbirds also introduced an updated arrangement to go with the new lyrics.  Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick describes the new version as "brutal, menacing, and teetering on all-out violence"<ref name="Shadwick"/> and Birnbaum refers to it as "anticipat[ing] the psychedelic and heavy-metal movements soon to come".<ref name="Birnbaum p29">Birnbaum 2012, p. 29.</ref>  It opens with a new drum part by [[Jim McCarty]] and harmonized guitar [[Audio feedback|feedback]], before Beck's train whistle simulation.<ref name="Shadwick"/>  Unlike their earlier song, Relf's vocal is not double tracked nor does he play harmonica and the rhythm remains on the riff throughout the song.  The guitar work, with both Beck and Page contributing lead-guitar parts,<ref>Relf has stated that Dreja was the second guitarist on "Stroll On", although Dreja has not confirmed this.  The Yardbirds had been filmed earlier performing the song when Page was still on bass. Birnbaum 2012, p. 386, fn 1.</ref> has been called "revolutionary", from the opening "wall of feedback", the use of "jarringly dissonant chords", and the "twining guitar duet".<ref name="Birnbaum p29"/><ref>Birnbaum also writes "the twin guitar part owes a lot to [[Chuck Berry]]" (Birnbaum 2012, p. 30), although his early 1960s recordings with [[Matt Murphy (blues guitarist)|Matt Murphy]] use the conventional rhythm/lead guitar distinction rather than dual leads.</ref>  During October 12<U+2013>14, the Yardbirds were filmed [[lip sync]]ing the song for ''Blowup''.  Their scene was staged on a set at [[Elstree Studios]] designed to resemble the [[Ricky-Tick]], a popular London club and, at Antonioni's direction, Beck smashes his guitar, in the [[Auto-destructive art|manner]] of [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]].<ref>Antonioni reportedly originally wanted the Who to perform their auto-destructive act for ''Blowup'', but they were out of contact. Birnbaum 2012, p. 30.</ref>  The song as performed in the film is edited (doubled) to increase its length for the story line.<ref name="Birnbaum p30"/>  "Stroll On" was later included on the ''Blow-Up'' [[Blow-Up (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] in 1967 and appears on the Yardbirds compilation albums ''Train Kept A-Rollin'/The Yardbirds Story'' and ''[[Ultimate!]]''.

After Jeff Beck's departure in late 1966, the Yardbirds continued to regularly perform the "The Train Kept A-Rollin'".  The original lyrics were used, but the "Stroll On" arrangement was followed with  Jimmy Page playing all the guitar parts.<ref name="Davis p108<U+2013>109">Davis 2003, pp. 108<U+2013>109.</ref>  Live performances with Page were later released on ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page]]'', ''Glimpses 1963<U+2013>1968'', and ''Last Rave-Up in L.A.''.

==Led Zeppelin performances==
Shortly after Keith Relf and Jim McCarty left the Yardbirds in mid-1968, Jimmy Page searched for new musicians for a successor band.  When the future members of [[Led Zeppelin]] rehearsed together for the first time in 1968, the first song they played was "Train Kept A-Rollin'".<ref>Shadwick 2005, p. 31.</ref>  [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] described their performance as "stunning" and Page recalled:
{{cquote|we did 'Train'... It was there immediately.  It was so ''powerful'' that I don't remember what we played after that.  For me it was just like, 'Crikey!' I mean, I'd had moments of elation with groups before, but nothing a intense as that.  It was like a thunderbolt, a lightning flash <U+2014> boosh!  Everyone sort of went 'Wow'...<ref>Wall 2008, p. 46.</ref>}}

The song was included in their early performances as "the New Yardbirds" and was featured as their opening number in Led Zeppelin's 1968 and 1969 tours, and was included on several [[Led Zeppelin bootleg recordings|bootleg albums]].<ref>Lewis 2005, various entries for September 7, 1968 to August 31, 1969 (pp. 21<U+2013>80).</ref>  In an interview, early [[MTV]] [[VJ (media personality)|video host]] [[J.J. Jackson (media personality)|J.J. Jackson]], who pointed out that he does not characterize Led Zeppelin's music as heavy metal, described a bootleg recording from their first American tour, "if this were the only recording somebody ever heard of them, it doesn't get much more 'heavy metal' sounding than this, does it?".<ref>Reddon 2012.</ref>  They later revived it for their final tour "[[Tour Over Europe 1980|Over Europe]]" in 1980. Though a studio version was never recorded by Led Zeppelin, as a solo artist Page recorded, during his ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' sessions in 1988, a version similar to the Led Zeppelin 1980 version.

In 1974, Aerosmith brought "Train Kept A-Rollin'" into the hard-rock mainstream.<ref name="Birnbaum p52"/>  [[Steven Tyler]], [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], and [[Tom Hamilton (musician)|Tom Hamilton]] had performed the song prior to joining Aerosmith.  Perry recalled, "'Train Kept A-Rollin'<nowiki>'</nowiki> was the only song we had in common when we first got together.  Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band&nbsp;... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back&nbsp;... I always thought if I could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me".<ref name="Birnbaum p52"/>  Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of "Stroll On" in ''Blowup''; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966:
{{cquote|I had seen the Yardbirds play somewhere the previous summer with both Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page in the band&nbsp;... In Westport [at their supporting gig on October 22, 1966] we found out that Jeff had left the band and Jimmy was playing lead guitar by himself.  I watched him from the edge of the stage and all I can say is that he knocked my tits off.  They did 'Train Kept A-Rollin'<nowiki>'</nowiki> and it was just so heavy.  They were just an un-fuckin'-believable band.<ref>Davis 2003, p. 48.</ref>}}

The song was an early feature of Aerosmith's concerts and a frequent show closer, including for their first gig in 1970.<ref name="Davis p108<U+2013>109"/>  They wanted to record a live version of the song, but producer [[Jack Douglas (record producer)|Jack Douglas]] persuaded them to record a studio version, which actually consisted of two different versions of the song.  The first part was slower, "more groove-oriented", while the second was a spirited rocker.<ref>

In 1974, "Train Kept A-Rollin'" was included on Aerosmith's second album ''[[Get Your Wings]]''.  A 3:15 edited version of the song without the added audience noises was released as a single, but it did not appear on the record charts.  The song continues to be a highlight of the group's shows and the album version has become a staple of [[album-oriented rock]] and [[classic rock]] radio.  It has become so identified with Aerosmith, that when Jeff Beck (whose 1965 and 1966 recordings with the Yardbirds inspired Tyler and Perry) occasionally performs it, he often hears "Hey, I like your angle on the Aerosmith tune".<ref>Menn 1992, p. 27.</ref>

The song is featured on three Aerosmith live compilations: ''[[Live! Bootleg (Aerosmith album)|Live! Bootleg]]'' (1978), ''[[Classics Live I and II|Classics Live]]'' (1986), and ''[[Rockin' the Joint]]'' (2005).<ref>

Additionally, the band is known to play two different versions of the song, the regular version of the song, as well as a slowed-down version often called "Slow Train" in the setlists.

{{cquote|As it evolved from ragtime through jazz, boogie-woogie, big-band swing, small combo rhythm-and-blues, rockabilly, blues-rock, acid rock, heavy metal, punk, thrash, psychobilly, and points beyond, 'Train Kept A-Rollin'<nowiki>'</nowiki> became increasingly wild and dissonant, as if each performer were trying to surpass the intensity of the previous one.
