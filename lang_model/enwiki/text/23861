'''Lady Tri<U+1EC7>u''' (225<U+2013>248) or '''''B<U+00E0> Tri<U+1EC7>u''''' ([[ch<U+1EEF> H<U+00E1>n]]: <U+5A46><U+8D99>) was a female warrior in 3rd century Vietnam who managed, for a time, to successfully resist the Chinese state of [[Eastern Wu]] during its occupation of Vietnam. She is also called  '''Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Trinh''', although her actual given name is unknown. She is quoted as saying, "I'd like to ride storms, kill sharks in the open sea, drive out the aggressors, reconquer the country, undo the ties of serfdom, and never bend my back to be the concubine of whatever man."<ref>[[:vi:Nguy<U+1EC5>n Kh<U+1EAF>c Vi<U+1EC7>n]] (1913-1997), ''Vietnam, a long history'', The Gioi Publishers, reprinted 2002, p. 22.</ref>
==Names==
Names in use in Vietnam, apart from B<U+00E0> Tri<U+1EC7>u (<U+5A46><U+8D99>) include Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u (<U+8D99><U+5AD7>), Tri<U+1EC7>u Trinh N<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng (<U+8D99><U+8C9E><U+5A18>), and Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Trinh (<U+8D99><U+6C0F><U+8C9E>). There are two primary sources that mention Lady Trieu by name. One is the official L<U+00EA> dynasty history, ''[[<U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t s<U+1EED> k<U+00FD> to<U+00E0>n th<U+01B0>]]'', and other is the official Nguyen dynasty history, ''Kh<U+00E2>m <U+0110><U+1ECB>nh Vi<U+1EC7>t S<U+1EED> Th<U+00F4>ng Gi<U+00E1>m C<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng M<U+1EE5>c''. Both sources give her name as ''Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u'' ({{linktext|<U+8D99>|<U+5AD7>}}).<ref>''[http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/sach/dvsktt/dvsktt04.html <U+0110><U+1EA1>i Vi<U+1EC7>t s<U+1EED> k<U+00FD> to<U+00E0>n th<U+01B0>]''<br/>''[http://www.sugia.vn/upload/fckeditor/kdvstgcm.pdf Kh<U+00E2>m <U+0110><U+1ECB>nh Vi<U+1EC7>t S<U+1EED> Th<U+00F4>ng Gi<U+00E1>m C<U+01B0><U+01A1>ng M<U+1EE5>c]''</ref> This translates to ''B<U+00E0> Tri<U+1EC7>u'' in modern Vietnamese, and to "Lady Trieu" in English. The given name "Th<U+1ECB> Trinh" appears in ''[[Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam s<U+1EED> l<U+01B0><U+1EE3>c]]'' (1921) by [[Tr<U+1EA7>n Tr<U+1ECD>ng Kim]]. Many cities in Vietnam have a street named ''B<U+00E0> Tri<U+1EC7>u'' in her honor.

<blockquote>''The M<U+1EAD>u Th<U+00EC>n year, [248], (11th year of H<U+00E1>n Di<U+00EA>n Hy ([[Liu Shan|Han Yanxi (<U+5EF6><U+7199>)]]); 11th year of X<U+00ED>ch <U+00D4> ([[Sun Quan|Chiwu (<U+8D64><U+70CF>)]])). The people of C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n (Jiuzhen (<U+4E5D><U+771F>)) again attacked citadels, the prefecture was in rebellion.

D<U+1EAD>n arrived, used the people's respect for him to call them to lay down arms, people surrendered, numbering more than 30,000 households, and the prefecture was once again peaceful. Afterwards, a woman from the C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n commandery named Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u assembled people and attacked several commanderies (<U+1EA8>u has breasts 3 th<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c [1.2 m] long, tied them behind her back, often rides elephants to fight). D<U+1EAD>n was able to subdue [her]. (Giao Ch<U+1EC9> records only write: In the mountains of C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n commandery there is a woman with the surname Tri<U+1EC7>u, with breasts 3 th<U+01B0><U+1EDB>c long, unmarried, assembled people and robbed the commanderies, usually wearing yellow tunics, feet wearing shoes with curved fronts, and fights while sitting on an elephant's head, becoming an immortal after she dies). </blockquote>

{{History of Vietnam}} 
''Viet Nam s<U+1EED> l<U+01B0><U+1EE3>c'' (A Brief history of Vietnam), a history book that written in early 20th century by Vietnamese historian [[Tran Trong Kim]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Tran Trong Kim|authorlink=Tran Trong Kim|year=2005|title=Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam s<U+1EED> l<U+01B0><U+1EE3>c|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City General Publishing House|place=[[Ho Chi Minh City]]|language=Vietnamese|pages=44<U+2013>45}} ([http://www.quehuongonline.vn/VietNam/Home/Dat-nuoc-Con-nguoi/Viet-Nam-su-luoc/2005/03/1DFB445D/ online equal source, look for the word "Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u"]. ''Please note that this online source is a bit different on naming style because it was converted from a different edition of the book "Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam s<U+1EED> l<U+01B0><U+1EE3>c". In older editions, real name of Lady Trieu was Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u but in newer editions Tr<U+1EA7>n Tr<U+1ECD>ng Kim changed Tri<U+1EC7>u <U+1EA8>u to Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Chinh (Trinh)'' [Tr<U+1EA7>n Tr<U+1ECD>ng Kim, op. cit., p.44])</ref> said the following about Lady Trieu:

<blockquote>
''In this year on C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n prefecture, there was a woman named Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Chinh{{#tag:ref|The use of the name "Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Chinh" is in this book. This is not a spelling mistake and is used to be faithful in translating the Vietnamese text. In addition, the word "Chinh" was pronounced like "Trinh" in Vietnamese language.|group=nb}} who organized a revolt against the Ng<U+00F4> [Wu].''

<br>
''Our [Vietnamese] history recorded that lady Trieu was a people of N<U+00F4>ng C<U+1ED1>ng district. Her parents were dead all when she was a child, she lived with her older brother Trieu Quoc Dat. At the age of 20, while she was living with her sister-in-law who was a cruel woman, she [Trieu Thi Trinh] killed her [sister-in-law] and went to the mountain. She was a strong, brave and smart person. On the mountain, she gathered a band of 1.000 followers.'' ''Her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him: ''"I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial housework?"''.

<br>
''The M<U+1EAD>u Th<U+00EC>n year, [248], because of the cruelty of Ng<U+00F4> [Wu] mandarins and misery of people, Trieu Quoc Dang revolted in C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n prefecture. Lady Trieu led her troops joined her brother's rebellion, soldiers of Trieu Quoc Dat made her leader because of her braveness. When she went to battles, she usually wore yellow tunics and rode a war-elephant. She proclaimed herself Nh<U+1EE5>y Ki<U+1EC1>u T<U+01B0><U+1EDB>ng qu<U+00E2>n (The Lady General clad in Golden Robe).''

<br>
''Giao Ch<U+00E2>u Inspector L<U+1EE5>c D<U+1EAD>n sent troops to fight [her], she [Trieu Thi Trinh] had managed to fight back the Ng<U+00F4> [Wu] forces for 5 or 6 months. Because of the lack of troops and fighting alone, she [Trieu Thi Trinh] could not manage to fight a long war and was defeated. She fled to B<U+1ED3> <U+0110>i<U+1EC1>n commune (present-day [[Ph<U+00FA> <U+0110>i<U+1EC1>n]] commune, [[M<U+1EF9> H<U+00F3>a]] district) and then committed suicide.''

<br>
''Later, the [[Ly Bon|Nam <U+0110><U+1EBF>]] (Southern Emperor) of [[Early L<U+00FD> Dynasty]] praised her as a brave and loyal person and ordered [his followers] build her a temple, and gave her the title of  ''"B<U+1EAD>t ch<U+00ED>nh anh h<U+00F9>ng t<U+00E0>i trinh nh<U+1EA5>t phu nh<U+00E2>n"'' (Most Noble, Heroic and Virgin Lady). Present day in [[Ph<U+00FA> <U+0110>i<U+1EC1>n]] commune, in the Thanh H<U+00F3>a province there is a temple [for her].''
</blockquote>

==Other accounts==

In the book ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945'' written by [[David G. Marr]], an American Professor, told the story of Trieu Thi Trinh as follow: Trieu Thi Trinh was a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} woman who had {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} breasts. She also had a voice which sounded like a temple bell, and she could eat many rice pecks and walk 500 leagues per day. Moreover, Trinh had a beauty that could shake any man's soul. Because of repeated altercations, she killed her sister and went to a forest in which she gathered a small army and attacked the Chinese.<ref name="Marr">{{cite book|title=Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945|author=David G. Marr|publisher=University of California Press|year=1984|ISBN=0-520-05081-9|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FkcZ_nGkW-oC&pg=PA198&dq=Trieu+Thi+Trinh#PPA198,M1|pages=198<U+2013>199}}</ref> When her brother tried to persuade her from rebelling, she told him:

<blockquote>I only want to ride the wind and walk the waves, slay the big whales of the Eastern sea, clean up frontiers, and save the people from drowning. Why should I imitate others, bow my head, stoop over and be a slave? Why resign myself to menial housework?<ref name="Marr"/></blockquote>

After hearing Trinh's words, her brother decided to join her. At first the Chinese underestimated Trinh for her being a female leader but after some encounters, they feared her because of her gaze. On a battle where Trieu Thi Trinh surrounded a Chinese port, Chinese general made his troops kick up lots of dust while they fought naked making her flee in disgust so her small army lost upon which she committed suicide.<ref name="Marr"/>

After death, Trinh continued haunting the Chinese general and forced him to defend by drawing one hundred penises and hanging them over the door.<ref name="Marr"/> Three centuries later, she still offered spiritual support for male Vietnamese opponent of the Chinese.<ref name="Marr"/> In the [[Ly Dynasty]] she was honored by the court with a lot of posthumous titles.<ref name="Marr"/> During the [[Le Dynasty]], [[Neo-Confucianism]] became Vietnam's national ideology and many scholars aggressively tried to bring the practices of Trieu Thi Trinh into conformity with Neo-Confucianism. Nevertheless, she survived all their manipulations.<ref name="Marr"/>

==Historical differences==
There are some historical differences between the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Vietnam]]ese accounts, however. Chinese records makes no mention of Trieu Thi Trinh.  All available information in regards to Trieu Thi Trinh come from solely from Vietnamese sources that were written during or after the late [[Ming Dynasty]].<ref name="Taylor1"/> For example the ''[[Sanguozhi]]'' (Records of the Three Kingdoms), a classical Chinese historical account, does mention about a rebellion at this time in the [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] of [[Jiaozhi]] ([[wikt:<U+4EA4><U+8DBE>|<U+4EA4><U+8DBE>]]; Vietnamese: Giao Ch<U+1EC9>) and [[Jiuzhen]] (<U+4E5D><U+771F>, Vietnamese: C<U+1EED>u Ch<U+00E2>n)  as following:

<blockquote>''<U+201C>In the 11th year of [[Sun Quan|Chiwu (<U+8D64><U+70CF>)]] [248] in Jiaozhi (<U+4EA4><U+8DBE>), Jiuzhen (<U+4E5D><U+771F>) rebels attacked walled cities which caused a great uproar. Lu Yin (<U+9678><U+80E4>) [of [[Hengyang|Hengyang (<U+8861><U+967D>)]] ] was given rank of the Inspector of Jiaozhou by [[Sun Quan|the Sovereign of Wu]]. He took his troops and entered the southern border and sent word to the rebels. He used his craftiness to convince them to accept his terms. [In] Gao Liang (<U+9AD8><U+6DBC>), the commander Huang Wu (<U+9EC4><U+5433>) with 3,000 households came out to surrender. Lu Yin now led the army south to that region. He announced his sincerity [to the aborigines] and distributed gifts. The [remaining] 100 rebel leaders and 50,000 households, who had been unruly and unapproachable, kowtowed [to Lu Yin]. Thus the territory was handed over peacefully.  At once Lu Yin was given the rank of General who Tranquilizes the South. Again he was sent on a [[punitive expedition]] against the rebels in Cang Wu (<U+84BC><U+68A7>). He defeated them quickly. From start to finish Lu Yin's military troops totaled 8,000. (Later commentaries also cited that Lu Yin then helped to plant crops and kept the people fed.) <U+201D>''<ref name="Ach">{{cite book|title=The Chronicle of the Three Kingdoms (220-265)|author=Ssu-ma, Kuang; Fang, Achilles; Solomon, Bernard S; Baxter, Glen W  |publisher=Cambridge, Mass : Harvard University Press|year=1952|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o4TfGAAACAAJ&dq=chronicles+of+the+three+kingdoms+achilles+fang}}</ref></blockquote>

Keith W. Taylor, an American professor, explained these differences as following:

<blockquote>''<U+201C>Chinese records do not mention Lady Trieu; our knowledge of her comes only from Vietnamese sources. From this it is evident that the events of 248 were remembered differently by the two sides. The Chinese only recorded their success in buying off certain rebel leaders with bribes and promises. The resistance led by Lady Trieu was for them simply a kind of stubborn barbarism that was wiped out as a matter of course and was of no historical interest. On the other hand, the Vietnamese remembered Lady Trieu's uprising as the most important event of the time. Her leadership appealed to strong popular instincts. The traditional image of her as a remarkable yet human leader, throwing her yard-long breasts over her shoulders when going into battle astride an elephant, has been handed down from generation to generation. After Lady Trieu's death, her spirit was worshipped by the Vietnamese. We owe our knowledge of her to the fact that she was remembered by the people.<U+201D>''<ref name="Taylor1">{{cite book|title=The Birth of Vietnam|last=Taylor|first=Keith W.|ISBN= 0-520-07417-3|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|page=90}}</ref></blockquote>

==Impact==
Lady Trieu's rebellion was not only the last Vietnamese rebellion to be led by a woman but also the end of a late political ideals inherited from [[Lac Viet|Lac]] lord.<ref>Taylor, op. cit, p. 91</ref>

Tri<U+1EC7>u Th<U+1ECB> Trinh is a greatly celebrated Vietnamese [[heroine]] and many streets are named after her in Vietnamese cities (there are <U+0110><U+01B0><U+1EDD>ng B<U+00E0> Tri<U+1EC7>u Streets in Hu<U+1EBF>, Hanoi, Saigon, and several other cities).
