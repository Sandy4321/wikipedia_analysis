{{for|songs by other artists|Gang bang (disambiguation)}}
"'''Gang Bang'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], from her twelfth studio album ''[[MDNA (album)|MDNA]]'', which was released on March 23, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.de/MDNA-Deluxe-Edition-Madonna/dp/tracks/B007FOV0QW/ref=dp_tracks_all_1/280-4843734-6314105#disc_1|title=MDNA (Deluxe Edition)|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.de]]|accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was written by Madonna, [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], [[William Orbit]], [[Priscilla Renea|Priscilla Hamilton]], [[Keith Harris (record producer)|Keith Harris]], Jean-Baptiste, Don Juan "Demo" Casanova, and produced by Madonna, Orbit and [[Demacio Castellon|The Demolition Crew]].  Madonna has cited American director [[Quentin Tarantino]] as an inspiration for the song, revealing that she wanted him as the director for the song's music video.

A [[Dance music|dance]]-oriented song, it lyrically portrays a scorned woman seeking revenge on her lover. Police sirens, whispered vocals, throbbing beats and a [[dubstep]] breakdown provide the song with a suspense-filled atmosphere. The song received critical acclaim, most calling it a highlight of the album and also the boldest track of the album.<ref name="Perpetua">{{cite web|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16426-mdna/|title=Madonna: MDNA|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=March 26, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-17}}</ref> Some even hailed it as one of Madonna's best songs.

Although not released as a single, the song has charted on the [[French Singles Chart]]<ref name=charts>{{cite web|title=Lescharts.com - Madonna - Gang Bang|url=http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Madonna&titel=Gang+Bang&cat=s|publisher=Les Charts.com. Hung Medien|accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Hot Dance/Electronic Digital Songs]] chart,<ref name="bb"/> due to strong digital downloads of the parent album. Madonna performed the song on her 2012 [[MDNA Tour]], in a motel setting where she is seen shooting the male dancers who infiltrate her room with blood being splattered on the backdrop. The performance was heavily criticised by the use of guns, but it received favorable reviews from critics.
 
==Background and inspiration==
[[File:Quentin Tarantino (Berlin Film Festival 2009).jpg|thumb|upright|Madonna wrote the song with the American film director [[Quentin Tarantino]] on her mind to direct a video for it.|alt=]]
While working on her then-upcoming album, Madonna enlisted [[William Orbit]] to work with her again; Orbit has worked with Madonna in some of her albums, producing the hits "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]", "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", "[[Beautiful Stranger]]", among others.<ref name=mtvnews1>{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Madonna Made 'Magic' With William Orbit On M.D.N.A.|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1677918/madonna-mdna-william-orbit.jhtml|accessdate=November 18, 2013|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=January 26, 2012}}</ref> The singer confessed, "Magic happens when we get into a recording studio together."<ref name=mtvnews1/> Orbitt insisted that despite the flurry of pop music floating around these days, they didn't give much thought to the music on [[Top 40 radio]]. Instead, they focused on their own music and the bubble of creativity they were living in. Orbit also revealed, "We liked what we're doing in this current time and space," he continued. "What we tended to do was watch old French films from the '60s or listen to music that was so far away that it wasn't, in any way, relevant."<ref name=mtvnews2>{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Madonna Rocked To Kreayshawn, French Films Making MDNA|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681831/madonna-mdna-album-kreayshawn.jhtml|accessdate=November 18, 2013|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=March 27, 2012}}</ref> 

Among the songs recorded for the album, "Gang Bang" was confirmed to be part of the tracklist. On March 8, the singer and co-writer of the track [[Mika (singer)|Mika]], tweeted that it was "weird as fuck, underground and lyrically cool; it's amazing and bizarre. I love it, she sounds so good singing words so harsh."<ref name=billboard>{{cite news|last=Caulfield|first=Keith|title=Madonna, 'MDNA': Track-By-Track Review|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1067073/madonna-mdna-track-by-track-review|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine){{!}}Billboard]]|date=March 9, 2012}}</ref> The same day, a snippet of the track was released.<ref name=idolator/> Orbit also commented about the song's dark tone and lyrics: 
{{quote|"[It's] aggressive". "It's like she sang that off the bat. I mean that. She created it in the moment. And the lyrics were all there, but I think she fell into a character. It was actually a good day. It wasn't a dark day. There wasn't like aggression in the air. The demo created out of the blue pretty much. She loved the spirit of it. We were all dancing around the control room. ... It was a total atmosphere of spontaneity. Pretty good fun, but it's dark."<ref name=mtvnews>{{cite news|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|title=Madonna Proclaims 'Queen Bitch' Status On MDNA|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1681770/madonna-mdna-album.jhtml|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> 
}}

Madonna has also said that she wrote the song with "[[Pulp Fiction]]" director [[Quentin Tarantino]] in mind, saying, "That's who I was thinking about when I was writing the song. I was picturing one of his movies, and one of the female characters. I have a whole thing worked out. All Quentin has to do is show up with a camera. I can't afford a director's fee."<ref name=mtvnewsgang>{{cite news|title=Madonna Wants Tarantino For 'Gang Bang' Video|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/madonna/352314-madonna-gang-bang-quentin-tarantino-girls-gone-wild-ban-uk-tour-date|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=[[MTV News]]|date=March 26, 2012}}</ref> However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, "I don<U+2019>t know.

I<U+2019>m not interested, just as I<U+2019>m not interested in commercials.

"We all just stood there. Everybody who was around me all had shock on their face. I heard a lot of `wows,'" Fransua said.

<blockquote>
"I do not condone violence or the use of guns," she wrote. "Rather they are symbols of wanting to appear strong and wanting to find a way to stop feelings that I find hurtful or damaging.
