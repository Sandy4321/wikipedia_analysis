'''''The Blue Lotus''''' ('''''{{lang|fr|Le Lotus bleu}}''''') is the fifth volume of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', the series of comic albums by Belgian cartoonist [[Herg<U+00E9>]]. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}}, it was serialised weekly from August 1934 to October 1935. Continuing where the plot of the previous story, ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'', left off, the story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who are invited to China in the midst of the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese invasion]], where he reveals the machinations of Japanese spies and uncovers a drug-smuggling ring.

''The Blue Lotus'' was a commercial success and was published in book form shortly after its conclusion. Herg<U+00E9> continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[The Broken Ear]]''.  In 1945, ''The Blue Lotus'' was re-drawn and coloured in Herg<U+00E9>'s distinctive ''{{lang|fr|[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]}}'' style for republication by [[Casterman]].   The ''Adventure'' introduces the recurring characters Dawson and Chang Chong-Chen. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the [[Ellipse Programm<U+00E9>|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.  Critical analysis has argued that ''The Blue Lotus'' is Herg<U+00E9>'s "first masterpiece". The series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]]. The book was included on [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde''{{'}}s 100 Books of the Century]] list.

== Synopsis ==
Staying at the palace of the Maharajah of Gaipajama in [[British Raj|India]], Tintin is approached by a visitor from [[Shanghai]] in [[Republic of China (1912<U+2013>49)|China]]. The visitor supplies him with the name of [[Mitsuhirato]], a Japanese businessman based in Shanghai, but before finishing his message is hit by a dart dipped in Rajaijah, the "poison of madness."{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2002|pp=1<U+2013>5}} Tintin and his fox terrier [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] travel to Shanghai to meet Mitsuhirato, who warns them that the Maharajah is in danger and that they should return to India. Surviving several attempts on his life by mysterious assailants, Tintin attempts to leave for India by boat, but is kidnapped. His abductors reveal themselves as members of a secret society known as the Sons of the Dragon, who are devoted to combating the opium trade. Their spokesman, [[Wang Chen-Yee]], explains to Tintin that Mitsuhirato is both a Japanese spy and an opium smuggler, and enlist Tintin in their fight to stop him. Tintin agrees, and spies on Mitsuhirato at the Blue Lotus [[opium den]]. Following the spy, he discovers him blowing up a Chinese railway. The Japanese government use this as an excuse to invade Northern China, taking Shanghai under its control.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2002|pp=5&ndash;22}}

Tintin is captured by Mitsuhirato, who plans to poison him with Rajaijah; however, a member of the Sons of the Dragon swaps the poison for coloured water, and Tintin escapes unscathed. When Mitsuhirato discovers the deception, he convinces Dawson, the corrupt Chief of Police at the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], to put a warrant out for Tintin's arrest. Meanwhile, Tintin enters the Settlement in search for Professor Fang Hsi-ying, an expert in poisons whom he hopes can develop a cure for Raijajah, but discovers that he has been kidnapped. Dawson's police arrest Tintin and hand him over to the Japanese, who sentence him to death before he is rescued by Wang.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2002|pp=23&ndash;41}}

Travelling to [[Hukow]] with the ransom money for Fang, Tintin comes across a flood that has destroyed a village and rescues a young Chinese orphan, Chang Chong-chen. Chang accompanies Tintin to Hukow, where one of Mitsuhirato's spies ambushes them; they realise that it was a trap and that Fang was not there. Meanwhile, the detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are employed by Dawson to arrest Tintin, but fail on multiple occasions.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2002|pp=42&ndash;48}}
Returning to Shanghai, Tintin intends to confront Mitsuhirato, and allows himself to be captured by him. Being held prisoner at The Blue Lotus, it is revealed that Mitsuhirato is working with the film director [[Roberto Rastapopoulos]], who is the head of the international opium smuggling organisation that Tintin had previously battled in ''Cigars of the Pharaoh''. However, Tintin is formulated a plan, with Chang and the Sons of the Dragon appearing to rescue Tintin and Fang; Rastapopoulos is arrested while Mitsuhirato commits [[seppuku]]. Fang develops a cure for Rajaijah, while Wang adopts Chang as his son.{{sfn|Herg<U+00E9>|2002|pp=49<U+2013>61}}

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|Japanese soldiers enter [[Shanghai]] in 1931; one of the events of the contemporary [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] depicted in the ''The Blue Lotus''.]]
Georges Remi<U+2014>best known under the pen name [[Herg<U+00E9>]]<U+2014>was employed as editor and illustrator of {{lang|fr|''[[Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me]]''}} ("''The Little Twentieth''"),{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1pp=31<U+2013>32|2a1=Thompson|2y=1991|2pp=24<U+2013>25}} a children's supplement to {{lang|fr|''[[Le XXe Si<U+00E8>cle]]''}} ("''The 20th Century''"), a staunchly Roman Catholic, [[social conservatism|conservative]] Belgian newspaper based in Herg<U+00E9>'s native Brussels which was run by the ''[[Abb<U+00E9>]]'' [[Norbert Wallez]].  In 1929, Herg<U+00E9> began ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic for {{lang|fr|''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''}}, revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].  Wallez ordered Herg<U+00E9> to set his first adventure in the [[Soviet Union]] to act as [[anti-socialism|anti-socialist]] propaganda for children (''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]''),{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=22<U+2013>23|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=34<U+2013>37}} to set his second adventure in the [[Belgian Congo]] to encourage colonial sentiment (''[[Tintin in the Congo]]''),{{sfnm|1a1=Assouline|1y=2009|1pp=26<U+2013>29|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2pp=45<U+2013>47}} and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (''[[Tintin in America]]'').{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=46}} On 24 November 1932, ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' published a fictional interview with Tintin in which the reporter announced that he would be travelling to China via Egypt, India, Sri Lanka, and Indochina.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=112|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=62}} This plotline resulted in ''Tintin in the Orient'', the first part of which was an ''Adventure'' set in Egypt, Arabia, and India that Herg<U+00E9> would later title ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''. ''Cigars'' ceased publication in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' in February 1934, with Herg<U+00E9> next providing the standalone story ''[[Popol out West]]'' for the newspaper.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=73}} ''The Blue Lotus'' would be the second half of the ''Tintin in the Orient'' story that Herg<U+00E9> had begun with ''Cigars of the Pharaoh''.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=51|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35}} 

However, Herg<U+00E9> knew as little about China as he did about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=60}} At the time most Belgians held to a negative stereotype of China, viewing it as "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable", and Herg<U+00E9> had long believed this view.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=48}} He had included Chinese characters in two previous ''Adventures'', in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clich<U+00E9>s. In ''Tintin in the Land of the Soviets'', he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in ''Tintin in America'' he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=60|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=51}} Herg<U+00E9> learned a bit about the country from [[Albert Londres]]' book ''China Madness'', based on Londres' experiences in the country.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=48}} He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film ''[[Fl<U+00FC>chtlinge]]'' (''At the End of the World'').{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=76}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="It was at the time of ''The Blue Lotus'' that I discovered a new world. For me up to then, China was peopled by a vague, slit-eyed people who were very cruel, who would eat swallows' nests, wear pig-tails and throw children into rivers... I was influenced by the pictures and stories of the [[Boxer Uprising]], where the accent was always on the cruelty of the yellow people, and this made a deep impact."|source=Herg<U+00E9>, talking to [[Numa Sadoul]].{{sfn|Peeters|1989|p=47}} }}
Learning of Herg<U+00E9>'s intention to set the next ''Adventure'' in China, Abbot L<U+00E9>on Gosset, a Roman Catholic chaplain to the Chinese students at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834<U+2013>1968)|Catholic University of Louvain]], contacted Herg<U+00E9> and asked him to be cautious in his depiction of the country. His students read ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' and he thought it would be counterproductive if Herg<U+00E9> continued to propagate negative stereotypes about the Chinese people. Herg<U+00E9> was sensitive to Gosset's ideas, and Gosset proceeded to put him in touch with two of his Chinese students, Arnold Chiao Ch'eng-Chih and his wife Susan Lin. He also gave him the address of a Chinese student a year his junior, [[Zhang Chongren]].{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=144|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=50|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=74}} The pair first met on 1 May 1934, soon becoming close friends and spending every Sunday afternoon with each other for over a year.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=146|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=50|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=75}} Zhang later commented that he and Herg<U+00E9> became akin to "two brothers."{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=61}} A student of painting and sculpture at Brussels' [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], Zhang taught Herg<U+00E9> about Chinese artistic styles, giving him a set of traditional Chinese brushes and explaining to him the art of painting a tree and Chinese calligraphy, alongside explaining the tenets of [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy. Both his artistic and philosophical training under Zhang would have a profound effect over Herg<U+00E9>.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=60|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2pp=50&ndash;51|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=76}}

Herg<U+00E9> had also gotten in contact with Father <U+00C9>douard Neut, hosteller at the [[Saint-Andr<U+00E9> de Bruges Abbey|Saint-Andr<U+00E9> Abbey]] near [[Bruges]]. Neut had a special interest in China, and was excited by Herg<U+00E9>'s latest venture, commenting that it could contribute to "a work of inter-racial understanding and true friendship between Orientals and whites."{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=146|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=49|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=75}} He sent him two books, Father Thad<U+00E9>e's ''Aux origines du conflict mandchou'' (''On the Origins of the Manchu Conflict'') and Zheng Zheng's ''Ma M<U+00E8>re'' (''My Mother''), a first-hand account of Chinese family life.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=146|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=49|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=75}} He also sent Herg<U+00E9> a 1932 article discussing the differences between Chinese and Japanese cultures.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=146|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=49|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=75}} At the time, Neut worked as the assistant of Lou Tseng-tsiang, a Chinese Catholic who had moved to Belgium, where he published a book on the Japanese invasion and occupation of [[Manchuria]], an area of northern China.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=146}} Mainstream Western press was broadly sympathetic to the Japanese cause, viewing them as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, something that Herg<U+00E9> would eschew.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=52}}

===Original publication, 1934&ndash;1935===
The comic began serialisation in ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' on 9 August 1934 as ''Les Aventures De Tintin Reporter En Extr<U+00EA>me-Orient'' (''The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East'').{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=33|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=51}} It subsequently also began serialisation in France in ''C<U+0153>urs Vaillants'' from 29 December 1935,{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=33}} and then in the Swiss magazine ''L'<U+00C9>cho Illustr<U+00E9>''.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=194}} Alongside Tintin and Snowy, the protagonists of the ''Adventures'', Herg<U+00E9> also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=35}} He also alluded to the movie that Tintin had witnessed being filmed in ''Cigars'', Rastapopoulos' ''The Sheik's House'', having characters enter a cinema where it was being screened.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}}

[[File:The Bloe Lotus Petit Vingtieme.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''The Blue Lotus'' on the front cover of an edition of ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me''.]]
Herg<U+00E9> actively satirised typical European opinions of China in ''The Blue Lotus''. To do so, he had Thomson and Thompson dress in what they perceived as traditional Chinese costume, as [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarins]], only to stand out in stark contrast to the actual clothing worn in China. He also had Gibbons, one of the story's antagonists, express racist attitudes toward the Chinese, and made Tintin give a speech to Tchang explaining western misunderstandings of the Chinese.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=62|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=77}} He also took "a radical view" by expressing a critical view of Western activity in China's International Settlement, depicting it as extremely corrupt and only interested in its own commercial interests.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}} He gained much of his information on such issues from Zhang, who informed him of the political events occurring in China from a Chinese perspective.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=61}} Building on this information, Herg<U+00E9>'s depiction of the Japanese invasion was largely accurate,{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=78}} although it served as an outright attack on Japanese imperialism.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=54}} Herg<U+00E9> depicted fictionalised versions of both the real-life [[Mukden Incident]], although he shifted its location nearer to Shanghai, and Japan's walk-out of the [[League of Nations]].{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=52|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35}} However, ''The Blue Lotus'' contained no mention of one of the central historical events of the period, the [[Long March]] of communist [[Mao Zedong]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=78}} 

Further devoting himself to greater accuracy, Herg<U+00E9> also made increasing use of photographs to draw from, such as of Chinese clothing, street scenes, and landscape.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=61|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2pp=51<U+2013>52}} Herg<U+00E9>'s new found emphasis on accuracy and documentation imbued the rest of the ''Adventures''.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=1989|1p=48|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=74}} Having relied on nonsensical Arabic for the backgrounds in ''Cigars'', for ''The Blue Lotus'' Zhang drew the many [[Chinese character|ideograms]] that appeared as street signs and advertisements throughout the story.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=52|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=33|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3p=75}} Among these ideograms were those of a political nature, proclaiming slogans such as "Down with Imperialism", "Abolish unfair treaties", and "Down with Japanese merchandise".{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=62|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=78}} Zhang also sketched out a number of images for Herg<U+00E9>, such as the outline of Wang's house.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=154}} Zhang's signature was also included twice throughout the comic, reflecting his artistic contribution;{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=62}} Herg<U+00E9> wanted to include his name as co-author.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=52}} In gratitude, Herg<U+00E9> created the character of Tchang in honour of his friend Zhang.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=62|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=51|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=34}}

Upon realising the anti-Japanese tone of the story, Japan's diplomats stationed in Belgium issued an official complaint, conveyed to Herg<U+00E9> by Lieutenant-General Raoul Pontus, president of the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=63|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=55|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=52|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=79}} The diplomats threatened to take their complaint to the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] at [[The Hague]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=63}} In learning of this, Zhang congratulated Herg<U+00E9>, stating that it would only further expose the actions of Japan in China to further international scrutiny and would make Herg<U+00E9> "world-famous".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=79}} Herg<U+00E9>'s comic also came under criticism from a Belgian general, who commented that "This is not a story for children... It's just a problem for Asia!"{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=55}} The story was nevertheless a commercial success, and ''Le Petit Vingti<U+00E8>me'' organised a celebration to commemorate the return of Tintin from the Far East, sponsored by the L'Innovation and Bon March<U+00E9> department stores. Taking place at the [[Cirque Royal]], it was attended by 3000 fans of the series, many of whom were Scouts, and involved an actor portraying Tintin accompany Herg<U+00E9>, the newspaper's staff, a contortionist and a clown.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=54}}

In September 1935, Zhang had to return to China at his family's request.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=169|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=79}}  Herg<U+00E9> meanwhile set about preparing the comic for publication in book form through [[Casterman]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=79}} Very proud of this ''Adventure'', he encouraged them to increase the level of marketing and advertising for this work.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=79}} At their advice, he renamed the story from ''The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East'' to ''The Blue Lotus'', commenting of this new title: "It is short, it sounds Chinese and it is mysterious."{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=182|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=53|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=79&ndash;80}} At Casterman's prompting, he also inserted a number of coloured plates throughout the work, and devised a new design for the front cover.{{sfnm|1a1=Goddin|1y=2008|1p=182|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=53|3a1=Peeters|3y=2012|3pp=79&ndash;80}} The book was finally published in October 1936.{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=33|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=81}} Herg<U+00E9> was very pleased with the product, commenting that "I was just bowled over! It is the height of luxury and my first thought was 'It's much too good for children!'... I was far from expecting that."{{sfn|Goddin|2008|p=194}} He sent a copy to Zhang, who replied to thank him.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=54}} After news of its publication reached China, political leader [[Soong May-ling]] invited Herg<U+00E9> to visit her there, although he was unable to do so due to the impending [[Second World War]]. He finally took up her offer in 1973, visiting her on the island of [[Taiwan]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=63}}

===Second version, 1946===
In the 1940s and 1950s, when Herg<U+00E9>'s popularity had increased, he and his team at [[Studios Herg<U+00E9>]] redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures in colour using the ''{{lang|fr|[[ligne claire]]}}'' ("clear line"){{efn|Herg<U+00E9> himself did not use the term ''ligne claire'' to describe his drawing style. Cartoonist [[Joost Swarte]] first used the term in 1977.{{sfn|Pleban|2006}} }} drawing style he had developed so that they visually fitted in with the new Tintin stories being created. The Studios reformatted and coloured ''The Blue Lotus'' in 1946.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=34}} Little was actually changed for the 1946 edition, although many of the backgrounds were embellished.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=60}} Minor alterations included replacing three highland Scotsman who briefly featured in the story with three Sikhs.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}} The map that appears on the opening page was made smaller, while the reference to [[Sir Malcolm Campbell]] was removed.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}} The European Palace Hotel was renamed The Continental, while Gibbons' company was also renamed from the Americano-Anglo Chinese Stell {{sic}} Company Limited to American and Chinese Steel Incorporated, and the drug smuggling ship known as the S.S. ''City of Doodlecastle'' was renamed the [[Japanese ship-naming conventions#Merchant ships|S.S. ''Harika Maru'']].{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=58}}

===Later publications===
Both Rastapopoulos and Dawson reappeared in the series 20 years later in ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=58|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=35}}  Casterman republished the original black-and-white version in 1979 in a French-language collected volume with ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'' and ''The Broken Ear'', the second part of the ''{{lang|fr|Archives Herg<U+00E9>}}'' collection.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=33}} In 1985, Casterman published a facsimile version of the original.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=33}} Meanwhile, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], the British publisher of ''The Adventures of Tintin'', felt that the story was dated, and only published ''The Blue Lotus'' in 1983, the year of Herg<U+00E9>'s death.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=59}} The translation into English was undertaken by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, although it lost the English accent of the British troops which was conveyed in the original French.{{Sfn|Farr|2001|p=57}} ''The Adventures of Tintin'' also became popular in Japan, something Tintinologist Michael Farr thought indicated that the Japanese had not taken offence to Herg<U+00E9>'s portrayal of them in ''The Blue Lotus''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=55}}  After Herg<U+00E9>'s death, the original illustrated manuscript of ''The Blue Lotus'' was discovered at Studio Herg<U+00E9>, and was subsequently exhibited as the centrepiece of an exhibit commemorating the 60th anniversary of ''The Adventures of Tintin''.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=64|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=59}}

Tintinologists Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier commented that ''The Blue Lotus'' was "unarguably Herg<U+00E9>'s first masterpiece".{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=35}} They felt that for the first time in the series, "one senses that the story has become important" as Tintin first expresses "a purpose, a mission" to his adventure.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=36}} Commenting on the character of Tchang, they thought that he was an "endearing personality" despite having little relevance the plot, also believing that Dawson and Gibbons were the most loathsome characters in the ''Adventure''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=34}} They compared the scene in which the Japanese invaded China with that in ''Tintin in America'' where the U.S. army force Native Americans off of their land, and praised the linear illustrations of the story, although also opined that the original black-and-white version was better than its colour counterpart.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=36}} Overall, they awarded ''The Blue Lotus'' four stars out of five.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=36}}

Tintinologist [[Harry Thompson]] noted that some people believed that Herg<U+00E9>'s depiction of the Japanese as buck-toothed and inherently violent in ''The Blue Lotus'' was [[racism|racist]]. He nevertheless thought that these accusations "stupidly" missed "the point of the story", which was to counter widespread racist attitudes toward East Asians among Belgians.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=62&ndash;63}} Due to the inclusion of actual historical events, he thought that the comic lacked the "timelessness" of other ''Adventures'' but that for 1934 it was "a marvelous piece of comic strip art".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=64}} Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] thought that the book combined "social realism" with the spirit present in the work of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]].{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=49}}

[[File:Benoit Peeters 20100329 Salon du livre de Paris 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a middle-aged man speaking into a microphone.|Herg<U+00E9> biographer and Tintinologist [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] considered ''The Blue Lotus'' to be a turning point in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' "both graphically and ideologically."]]
Herg<U+00E9> biographer [[Beno<U+00EE>t Peeters]] thought that there was an obvious difference in ''The Adventures of Tintin'' before and after ''The Blue Lotus'', and that it represented "an essential turning point both graphically and ideologically" as Herg<U+00E9> shifted from his former "classically right-wing" ideas.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|pp=76&ndash;77, 82}} Also feeling that the work was "exceptionally moving,"{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=76}} he noted that ''The Blue Lotus'' was far from ''Tintin in the Congo'' in its attitude to non-Europeans, while other Belgian comic strips like ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' and ''[[Buck Danny]]'' would continue to perpetuate negative stereotypes of East Asians for decades.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=77}} Elsewhere, he stated that it was the first ''Adventure'' where Herg<U+00E9> "really took control" of the story, also opining that it was the "most politically involved" entity in the series.{{sfn|Peeters|1989|pp=46, 48}}

Tintinologist Michael Farr stated that there was a "general agreement" that ''The Blue Lotus'' was Herg<U+00E9>'s first masterpiece, being "better planned" than its predecessors and for the first time having "a carefully devised structure". At the same time he thought that it retained the best qualities of the earlier works.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=51}} Thinking it "much more serious" than Tintin's prior ''Adventures'', he nevertheless thought it "no less enjoyable", being the first story to bring "emotion and tragedy" to the series.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=55&ndash;56}} Farr thought that Herg<U+00E9>'s "total absorption" in his subject resulted in him gaining an "extraordinary feel" for it and allowed him to foresee future political events in China much like a "finely tuned" political commentator.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=54}} He singled out the depiction of the Mukden Incident for particular praise, thinking it "a marvellous example of political satire".{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=52}} Tintinologist Philippe Goddin thought that this depiction of the build-up to invasion was "brilliantly" done, also comparing it to the scene of ethnic cleansing in ''Tintin in America''.{{sfn|Goddin|2008|pp=157, 159}}

Literary critic [[Tom McCarthy (writer)|Tom McCarthy]] thought that ''The Blue Lotus'' showed evidence of Herg<U+00E9>'s "left-wing counter-tendency" that rejected his earlier right-wing worldview.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=38}} He believed that this was partly due to the influence of Zhang, who had destroyed Herg<U+00E9>'s "European absolutism", and overall thought of it as "the most visually rich of all the Tintin books".{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=48}} Literary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolid<U+00E8>s]] of [[Stanford University]] thought that Wang signified the forces of good in the story while Rastapopoulos represented evil, and that the character Didi&nbsp;<U+2013> who was poisoned with Raijaijah&nbsp;<U+2013> inverted "the model of justice ruling the world of the Good". He saw a similarity between Didi and Tintin, who both have "feline suppleness, a devotion to good causes, and the patience of an animal stalking its prey".{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|pp=75<U+2013>77}} He furthermore argued that Didi's desire to behead people when under the poison's influence expressed his [[Oedipus complex]] and was a substitute for [[castration]].{{sfn|Apostolid<U+00E8>s|2010|p=77}}

==Adaptations==
''The Blue Lotus'' was adapted into a 1991 episode of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' television series by French studio [[Ellipse]] and Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}} Directed by St<U+00E9>phane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}
