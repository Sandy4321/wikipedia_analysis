'''''Slava''''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0421><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0430>}} "Glory") was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], the last of the five {{Sclass|Borodino|battleship}}s. Commissioned too late to participate in the [[Battle of Tsushima]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], she survived while all of her [[sister ship]]s were either sunk during the battle or surrendered to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].

Serving in the [[Baltic Sea]] during [[World War I]], ''Slava'' was the largest ship of the Russian Gulf of Riga Squadron that fought the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German High Seas Fleet]] in the [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga]] in August 1915. She repeatedly bombarded German positions and troops for the rest of 1915 and during 1916. During the [[Battle of Moon Sound]] in 1917 ''Slava'' was badly damaged by the German [[dreadnought]] {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig}}, significantly increasing her draft. The shallow channel made it impossible to escape and she was [[scuttled]] in the Moon Sound Strait between the island of [[Muhu]] (Moon) and the mainland. The Estonians [[scrapped]] her during the 1930s.

==Description==
[[File:Borodino class battleship diagrams Brasseys 1906.jpg|thumb|left|300px|<center>Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906</center>]]''Slava'' was {{convert|389|ft|5|in|m}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]] and {{convert|397|ft|3|in|m|1}} long [[length overall|overall]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|76|ft|1|in|m|1}} and a [[Draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|29|ft|2|in|m|1}}, {{convert|38|in|0}} more than designed. Her normal displacement was {{convert|14415|LT|t|0|lk=on}}, almost {{convert|900|LT|t|abbr=on|0}} more than her designed displacement of {{convert|13516|LT|t|abbr=on|0}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 136</ref>

Two 4-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] drove four-bladed [[propeller]]s, with twenty Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s providing steam to the engines at a pressure of {{convert|19|atm|kPa psi|0|lk=on}}. The engines and boilers were both built by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]]. The engines had a total designed output of {{convert|15800|ihp|0|lk=on}}, but they produced {{convert|16378|ihp|abbr=on}} on trials and gave a top speed of {{convert|17.64|knots}}. At full load she carried {{convert|1350|LT|MT|0}} of coal that provided her a range of {{convert|2590|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. She had four steam-driven [[dynamo]]s, each with a capacity of 150&nbsp;kW, and two auxiliary generators with a capacity of 64&nbsp;kW each.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 137, 144</ref>

''Slava''{{'}}s [[12 inch 40 caliber naval gun|12 inch 40 caliber]] guns were mounted in two twin-gun [[gun turret|turrets]], one each fore and aft. They had a rate of fire of about one round per minute, increasing to one round per 40 seconds sometime before 1914 when their loading equipment was improved.  Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The twelve 45-caliber {{convert|6|in|mm|0|adj=on}} guns were mounted in six electrically powered twin-gun turrets carried on the upper deck. They had a practical rate of fire of about three rounds per minute and were provided with 180 rounds per gun. Four of the twenty {{convert|75|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} guns used against [[torpedo boat]]s were mounted in [[casemate]]s just below the forward main gun turret, two on each side. These guns were placed well above the waterline for use in any weather, unlike the remaining sixteen guns, which were mounted in casemates one deck lower and distributed over the length of the ship, close to the water. This was graphically demonstrated when ''Slava''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperator Aleksander III|1901|2}} made a high-speed turn during her trials, [[Sailing#Heeling|heeling]] 15<U+00B0>, and began taking water through the lower casemates. Each gun had 300 rounds available. All but four of her {{convert|47|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s were removed before she was completed and the remaining guns were used as [[gun salute|saluting guns]]. She carried four {{convert|15|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s, one above water in the bow and one in the stern with two [[torpedo]]es each, and a submerged tube on each side forward with three torpedoes each. Two of these were removed before 1914, although it is not known which ones were retained.<ref>McLaughlin, pp. 142, 295</ref>

===Wartime modifications===
She was reportedly fitted with two 47&nbsp;mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns during the war, but carried only four {{convert|3|in|0|adj=on}} AA guns in early 1917. Her light armament had been reduced to twelve 75&nbsp;mm guns by that same date. While she was laid up over the winter of 1916 at [[Helsinki]], the elevation of her main guns was increased to a maximum of 25<U+00B0> which increased their range to {{convert|23000|yd}}.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 302</ref>

==Service==
''Slava'' was built by the [[Baltic Shipyard|Baltic Works]] at [[Saint Petersburg]]. She was laid down on 1 November 1902, launched on 29 August 1903, and completed in October 1905, too late to participate in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Together with the battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Tsesarevich||2}}, she helped to suppress the [[Sveaborg Rebellion]] in 1906.<ref name=m6>McLaughlin, p. 146</ref> ''Slava'' was assigned to a training squadron for new officers fresh from the Naval College that was formed after the Rebellion as part of the post-[[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]] naval reforms. On one of her training cruises to the [[Mediterranean]], her crewmen rescued survivors during the [[1908 Messina earthquake]] and the ship took casualties to [[Naples]] for medical care. She had a serious boiler accident in August 1910 and was towed by ''Tsesarevich'' to [[Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs before sailing to [[Toulon]] for repairs that required nearly a year to complete. Upon her return to [[Kronstadt]] she was relieved of her training assignment and transferred to the [[Baltic Fleet]].<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 9<U+2013>17</ref>

The Baltic Fleet only had four pre-dreadnoughts in service, as the Second Brigade of Battleships, when World War I began, although the four [[dreadnought]]s of the {{sclass|Gangut|battleship|4}} were almost finished. After they were completed and could defend the mouth of the [[Gulf of Finland]], ''Slava'' sailed through the [[Irbe Strait]] on 31 July 1915 to assist Russian forces defending the [[Gulf of Riga]]. More specifically she was to support the [[Imperial Russian Army]] with her guns and to defend the gulf against [[German Empire|German]] naval forces.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 298</ref>

===Battle of the Gulf of Riga===
{{Main|Battle of the Gulf of Riga}}
Barely a week later, on 8 August, the Germans began to sweep the [[Naval mine|mines]] defending the Irbe Strait, and ''Slava'', accompanied by the gunboats [[Soviet gunboat Krasnoye Znamya|''Khrabryi'']] and {{ship|Russian gunboat|Groziashchii||2}}, [[sortie]]d to fire on the [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s. The German pre-dreadnoughts {{SMS|Elsass||2}} and {{SMS|Braunschweig||2}} attempted to drive the Russians off, but ''Slava'' remained in position despite sustaining splinter damage from near misses. She did not open fire, as her captain did not want to reveal the fact that she was out-ranged by the German battleships.<ref>Nekrasov, p. 47</ref> The Germans were not prepared for the number of mines laid by the Russians and withdrew to reconsider their plans. 

They tried again on 16 August, this time with the dreadnoughts {{SMS|Nassau||2}} and {{SMS|Posen||2}} defending the minesweepers.<ref>Halpern, pp. 196<U+2013>97</ref> ''Slava'' flooded her side compartments to give herself a 3<U+00B0> [[list (watercraft)|list]] which increased her maximum range to about {{convert|18000|yd|0}}. She did not engage the German battleships, but only fired on the minesweepers and any German ships such as the [[armored cruiser]] {{SMS|Prinz Adalbert||2}} when they approached the other Russian ships.<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> When the Germans returned the next day ''Slava'' was hit three times by {{convert|283|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} shells in quick succession. The first hit penetrated her upper belt armor and exploded in a coal bunker; the second hit penetrated her upper deck, hit the supporting tube of the aft port side six-inch turret and started a fire in the ammunition hoist which caused the [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] to be flooded. The third shell passed through a pair of the ship's boats, but exploded in the water off to one side.<ref name=m29>McLaughlin, p. 299</ref> These hits did not seriously damage ''Slava'' and she remained in place until ordered to retreat.<ref>Nekrasov, p. 52</ref> The Germans entered the Gulf the next day, but they were forced to withdraw shortly afterward when the British [[submarine]] {{HMS|E1||2}} torpedoed the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} on 19 August and the Russian [[coastal artillery]] that still commanded the Irbe Strait made it very risky to enter the Gulf of Riga.<ref>Halpern, p. 198</ref>

The German withdrawal allowed ''Slava'', after repairs, to switch to her other task and support the army with gunfire. During one of these missions, as she was bombarding German positions near [[Tukums]] on 25 September 1915, she was hit in the [[conning tower]] while at anchor, killing her captain and five others. McLaughlin attributes the hit to German [[field artillery]],<ref name=m29/> but Nekrasov quotes German accounts that attribute it to a {{convert|10|kg|adj=on|sp=us}} bomb dropped by one of a pair of German seaplanes.<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref> ''Slava'' remained in position and resumed her bombardment. She continued to support the Army until the water in the Gulf of Riga threatened to freeze over at which time she retired to the port of [[Kuivastu]] to winter over.<ref>Nekrasov, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref> While still in port she was hit by three light bombs dropped by a seaplane on 12 April 1916; these did little material damage, but killed seven sailors. On 2 July she resumed her support of the army with a bombardment of advancing German troops despite sustaining one hit by an {{convert|8|in|adj=on|0}} shell on her waterline armor that caused no damage. She repeated these missions a number of times in July and August.<ref>Nekrasov, p. 64</ref> These annoyed the Germans enough that they attempted to sink ''Slava'' with a coordinated ambush by the submarine {{SMU|UB-31}} and low-flying [[torpedo bomber]]s as she responded to a feint by German cruisers on 12 September, but all their torpedoes missed.<ref>McLaughlin, p. 300</ref> This was the first attack by torpedo bombers against a moving battleship.<ref>Nekrasov, p. 67</ref>

===Battle of Moon Sound===
{{Main|Battle of Moon Sound}}
''Slava'' was held back during the initial stages of the German landings ([[Operation Albion]]) on [[Saaremaa]] (Oesel) Island guarding the mouth of the Gulf of Riga in October 1917 to defend Kassar Wiek (Inlet), which separates the outer islands of Saaremaa and [[Hiiumaa]] (Dag<U+00F6>). She intermittently fired at German [[torpedo boat]]s as they fought Russian light forces in Kassar Wiek on 15 and 16 October, but scored no hits from her position near [[Kesselaid]] (Schildau) Island in Moon Sound Strait.<ref>Staff, pp. 85, 98<U+2013>99</ref> On the morning of 17 October the Germans attempted to sweep the Russian mines placed at the southern entrance to Moon Sound Strait. ''Slava'', the pre-dreadnought [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Grazhdanin'']] and the [[armored cruiser]] {{ship|Russian cruiser|Bayan|1900|2}} were ordered south to meet them by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Mikhail Bakhirev]], opening fire on the minesweepers at 8:05 a.m.<ref group=Note>[[Central European Time]] is used in this section</ref> The dreadnoughts {{SMS|K<U+00F6>nig||2}} and {{SMS|Kronprinz|1914|2}} were to provide cover for the minesweepers, but ''Slava'', sailing further south, opened fire on them at 8:12 at nearly her maximum range. ''Grazhdanin'', whose turrets had not been modified for extra elevation, remained behind with ''Bayan'' and continued to engage the minesweepers. The German ships returned fire, but their shells fell short at a range of {{convert|20400|m|yd|sp=us}}. ''Slava'' continued to fire on the Germans, but scored no hits, although some shells impacted only {{convert|50|m|sp=us}} from ''K<U+00F6>nig''. The German ships were at a severe disadvantage as they were sailing in a narrow swept channel and could not maneuver, so they reversed course to get out of range.<ref>Staff, pp. 110, 112</ref>

The German minesweepers made good progress, despite minor damage from shell splinters and numerous near misses by ''Slava'', ''Grazhdanin'', ''Bayan'', and the Russian shore batteries. During this period ''Slava''{{'}}s front turret became inoperable when a [[bronze]] [[rack and pinion]] gear bent so that the gear wheel could not be moved. Only eleven shots had been fired between the two guns in the turret before the breakdown. ''Slava'' and her consorts were ordered north to allow the crews to eat lunch, but returned to the fray and opened fire on the minesweepers again at 10:04 with her rear turret at an approximate range of {{convert|12000|yd|0}}. The minesweepers had cleared a channel to the north while the Russians were eating and the dreadnoughts took advantage of it to engage the Russian pre-dreadnoughts. ''K<U+00F6>nig'' opened fire on ''Slava'' at 10:14 and hit her with three shells from her third salvo. The first hit ''Slava''{{'}}s bow, {{convert|10|-|12|ft}} below the waterline, and exploded in the bow dynamo room, flooding that room, the forward 12-inch magazine and other bow compartments, while the second penetrated the [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]] flat. The ship took on {{convert|1130|MT|LT|0}} of water which gave her a list of 8<U+00B0>, later reduced to 4<U+00B0> by counter-flooding. This also increased her forward draft to about {{convert|32|ft}}. The third shell hit the port side armor abreast the engine room, but failed to penetrate. Two more shells struck her at 10:24 in the superstructure near the forward funnel. They damaged a six-inch magazine and the forward stokehold (boiler room) and started a fire which was put out after about fifteen minutes. However, the forward left six-inch magazine was flooded as a precaution. At 10:39 two more shells hit her, killing three men in the boiler room and flooding a coal bunker. Around this time ''Slava'' and her compatriots were ordered to retire to the north while ''Bayan'' trailed behind to divert fire from the battleships.<ref>Staff, pp. 113<U+2013>16</ref>

''Slava''{{'}}s draft had increased too much to allow her to use the dredged channel between Hiiumaa Island and [[Vormsi]] (Worms) Island so she was ordered to wait until all the other deep-draft ships had entered the channel and then scuttle herself at the channel entrance. However, the Sailors' Committee organized on the ship after the [[February Revolution]] had ordered the engine room abandoned for fear of sinking, and she grounded on a [[shoal]] southeast of the channel because there was no one to obey the captain's order to stop. A number of destroyers evacuated the crew before the rear 12-inch magazine exploded at 11:58. However this was not deemed sufficient and three destroyers were ordered to torpedo her. Only one of their six torpedoes worked and ''Slava'' settled on the shallow bottom with a hole on the starboard side near the funnel.<ref>Staff, pp. 116<U+2013>17</ref> She was officially struck off the Navy List on 29 May 1918 by the Soviets<ref name=m6/> and scrapped in 1935 by the [[Estonia]]ns.<ref>Gardiner and Gray, p. 294</ref>
