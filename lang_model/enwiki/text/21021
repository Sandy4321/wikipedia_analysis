'''Julius Saturninus''' (d. [[280]]) was an [[Roman usurper]].

Julius Saturninus was a [[Gaul]] by birth (others have him as a [[Moors|Moor]]) and was a friend of Emperor [[Probus]]. He was appointed governor of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] by Probus (ca. [[279]]).

After Probus had left Syria for the [[Rhine]] in [[280]], unruly soldiers and the people of [[Alexandria]] forced a reluctant Saturninus to accept imperial office. He fled from Alexandria to escape the pressure but changed his mind in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He proclaimed himself emperor in [[280]]. Before Probus could respond to the threat, Saturninus was dead, killed by his own troops.
