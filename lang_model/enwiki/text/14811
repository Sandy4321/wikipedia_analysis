:''For other persons named Jonathan Jones, see [[Jonathan Jones]]''
'''Jo Jones''' (October 7, 1911 <U+2013> September 3, 1985) (later known as '''Papa Jo Jones''') was an [[United States|American]] drummer, one of the most influential in the history of jazz. 

==Biography==
Born as '''Jonathan David Samuel Jones''' in [[Chicago, Illinois]], he moved to [[Alabama]] where he learned to play several instruments, including saxophone, piano, and drums. He worked as a drummer and tap-dancer at carnival shows until joining [[Walter Page]]'s band, the [[Oklahoma City Blue Devils|Blue Devils]] in [[Oklahoma City]] in the late 1920s. He recorded with trumpeter [[Lloyd Hunter]]'s Serenaders in 1931, and later joined pianist [[Count Basie]]'s band in 1933. Jones, Basie, guitarist [[Freddie Green]] and bassist [[Walter Page]] are one of the more important rhythm sections in jazz. Jones took a brief break for two years when he was in the [[military]]. He played with the band until 1948 and performed in the [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] concert series. {{fact|date=December 2009}}

Jones split off from the band in the late 1940s and created an image for himself. He was one of the first drummers to promote the use of brushes on drums and shifting the role of timekeeping from the bass drum to the hi-hat cymbal. Jones had a major influence on drummers such as [[Buddy Rich]], [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Roy Haynes]], [[Max Roach]], and [[Louie Bellson]]. He also starred in several films, most notably the musical short ''Jammin' the Blues'' in 1944. In 1985 Jones was the recipient of an American Jazz Masters fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts. {{fact|date=December 2009}}

Jones performed regularly in later years at the West End jazz club at 116th and Broadway in New York City. These performances were generally very well attended by other drummers such as Max Roach and Roy Haynes. In addition to his artistry on the drums, Jones was known for his irascible, combative temperament and his fondness for cognac. As he grew older he greatly resented jazz fans mistaking him for the bebop-era drummer [[Philly Joe Jones]] (no relation);{{fact|date=December 2009}} Jo Jones and Philly Joe Jones died a few days apart in 1985.

==Style==
In contrast to drummer [[Gene Krupa]]'s loud, insistent pounding of the bass drum on each beat, Jones often omitted bass drum playing altogether.   Jones also continued a ride rhythm on [[high-hat]] while it was continuously opening and closing instead of the common practice of striking it while it was closed. Jones's style influenced the modern jazz drummer's tendency to play timekeeping rhythms on a suspended cymbal that is now known as the [[ride cymbal]].

== Awards ==
In 1979, Jones was inducted into the [[Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame]] for his contribution to the [[Birmingham, Alabama]] musical heritage.
