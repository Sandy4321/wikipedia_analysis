'''Verificationism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] attitude that aims to formulate criteria of meaningfulness and to develop processes permitting unambiguous assessment of a theory's [[truth value|falsity or truth]].  Although verificationist principles of a general sort<U+2014>grounding [[scientific theory]] in some verifiable [[empiricism]]<U+2014>are found retrospectively even with the American [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[Charles Sanders Pierce|C S Pierce]] and with the French [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] [[Pierre Duhem]]<ref name=Misak/> who fostered [[instrumentalism]],<ref name=Epstein>Miran Epstein, ch 2 "Introduction to philosophy of science", in Clive Seale, ed, ''Researching Society and Culture'', 3<sup>rd</sup> edn (London: Sage Publications, 2012), [http://books.google.com/books?id=uhBCvNlypL4C&pg=PA18&dq=verificationists+verificationism+Popper+falsificationism+Duhem+instrumentalists pp 18<U+2013>19].</ref> the vigorous program termed ''verificationism'' was launched by the [[logical positivists]] who, emerging from [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] and [[Vienna Circle]] in the 1920s, sought [[epistemology]] whereby [[philosophy]] discourse would be meaningful, on par with [[empirical science]]s.

Initially, logical positivists sought a universal language whereby both [[natural language|ordinary language]] and [[physics]] could be [[axiom]]atized and reduced to [[symbolic logic]] while grounded on [[empiricism]].  Logical positivists' ''verifiability principle''<U+2014>that only statements logically or empirically verifiable are ''cognitively meaningful''<U+2014>rendered [[theology]], [[metaphysics]], and evaluative judgements, such as [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]], cognitively meaningless "pseudostatements", merely emotive or such.  Although varying by exact descriptions proposed, the crucial components of this verificationism program, which extended into the 1960s, were the verifiability criterion, the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic gap]], and the observation/theory gap.<ref name=Fetzer/>

==Origin==
Logical positivists garnered the verifiability criterion of cognitive meaningfulness from young [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s [[philosophy of language]] posed in his 1921 book ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'',<ref name=Popper/> and sought [[logicist]] reduction of mathematics to logic led by [[Bertrand Russell]].  Seeking grounding in such empiricism as of [[David Hume]],<ref>Despite Hume's radical empiricism, set forth near 1740, Hume was also committed to [[common sense]], and apparently did not take his own skepticism, such as the [[problem of induction]], as drastically as others later did [Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [http://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&pg=PA156&dq=induction+scandal+sceptical+common+sense "Hume"], p 156].</ref> [[Auguste Comte]], and [[Ernst Mach]]<U+2014>along with the [[positivism]] of the latter two<U+2014>they borrowed some perspectives from [[Immanuel Kant]], and found the exemplar of science to be [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

==Evolution==
Early, some logical positivists within [[Vienna Circle]] recognized that the verifiability criterion was too stringent.<ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer>Sahotra Sarkar & Jessica Pfeifer, eds, ''The Philosophy of Science: An Encyclopedia'', Volume 1: A<U+2013>M (New York: Routledge, 2006), "Rudolf Carnap", [http://books.google.com/books?id=od68ge7aF6wC&pg=PA83 p 83].</ref>  [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Otto Neurath]] led a faction seeking "liberalization of empiricism", a faction that also switched from [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]'s [[phenomenalism]]<U+2014>which accorded the mind virtually no power to know objects, and restricted scientific talk to phenomena as experienced patterns of sensations<U+2014>to Neurath's [[physicalism]],<ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/> which shifts talk to spatiotemporal, publicly observable objects and events.<ref name=Flew-Neurath>Antony G Flew, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', rev 2nd edn (New York: St Martin's Press, 1984), [http://books.google.com/books?id=MmJHVU9Rv3YC&pg=PA245&dq=Neurath+physicalism+verification "Neurath"], p 245.</ref>

Neurath also held that verification essentially [[coherence theory of truth|compares statements to other statements]], rather than [[correspondence theory of truth|statements directly to experience]].<ref name=Flew-Neurath/>  And Carnap suggested that empiricism's basis is but [[pragmatic]].<ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/>  In 1936, Carnap sought a switch from verification to ''confirmation'', as an unrestricted generalization cannot be verified but, according to Carnap, can confirmed.<ref name=Sarkar-Pfeifer/>  Eventually, [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]] proposed two types of verification<U+2014>''strong'' and ''weak''<U+2014>while weak verification would be obtainable when a proposition is rendered probable.  Meanwhile, Carnap sought to axiomatize a universal law's probability as a "degree of confirmation".<ref name=IEP-Carnap>Mauro Murzi [http://www.iep.utm.edu/carnap "Rudolf Carnap (1891<U+2013>1970)"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', 12 Apr 2001.</ref>

==Problems==
Despite employing abundant logical and mathematical tools to formalize a universal law's [[probability]] as "degree of confirmation", [[Rudolf Carnap]] never succeeded in this endeavor.<ref name=IEP-Carnap/>  In all of Carnap's formulations, a universal law's degree of confirmation is always zero.<ref name=IEP-Carnap/>  [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], who had studied with [[Hans Reichenbach]] in [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]] but was a [[prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] of Carnap in [[Vienna Circle]], [[emigrate]]d, as did Carnap and Reichenbach, to America.  The three brought the movement to a milder stance, distinguishable as ''logical empiricism''.  Hempel's [[paradox of the ravens]]<U+2014>aka, paradox of confirmation<U+2014>found that an observation report confirming even one case of a universal law's prediction could not be logically formalized without an apparent absurdity.

==Decline==
The 1951 article "[[Two dogmas of empiricism]]", by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], widely regarded as the most important philosophy article of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, attacked the [[analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic/synthetic division]] and apparently rendered the verificationist program untenable.  [[Carl Gustav Hempel|Carl Hempel]], one of verificationism's greatest internal critics, had recently concluded the same as to the verifiability criterion.<ref name=Fetzer>James Fetzer, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2013/entries/hempel "Carl Hempel"], in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2013): "However surprising it may initially seem, contemporary developments in the [[philosophy of science]] can only be properly appreciated in relation to the historical background of [[logical positivism]]. [[Carl Hempel|Hempel]] himself attained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement.  ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'' (1936; 2nd edition, 1946), authored by [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], offers a lucid exposition of the movement, which was<U+2014>with certain variations<U+2014>based upon the analytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical distinction, and the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness.<br><br>Hempel (1950, 1951), meanwhile, demonstrated that the verifiability criterion could not be sustained.  Since it restricts empirical knowledge to observation sentences and their deductive consequences, scientific theories are reduced to logical constructions from observables.  In a series of studies about cognitive significance and empirical testability, he demonstrated that the verifiability criterion implies that existential generalizations are meaningful, but that universal generalizations are not, even though they include general laws, the principal objects of scientific discovery. Hypotheses about relative frequencies in finite sequences are meaningful, but hypotheses concerning limits in infinite sequences are not.  The verifiability criterion thus imposed a standard that was too strong to accommodate the characteristic claims of science and was not justifiable".</ref>  In 1958, [[Norwood Russell Hanson|Norwood Hanson]] explained that even direct observations must be collected, sorted, and reported with guidance and constraint by theory, which sets a horizon of expectation and interpretation, how observational reports, never neutral, are [[theory-laden|laden with theory]].<ref> Bruce Caldwell, ''Beyond Positivism: Economic Methodology in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century'', rev edn (London: [[Routledge]], 1994), [http://books.google.com/books?id=hrqLZsCOg4sC&pg=PA47&dq=assumption+implicit p 47<U+2013>48].</ref>

[[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]]'s [[The Logic of Scientific Discovery|1959 book]] proposing [[falsificationism]], originally published in German in 1934, reached the [[Anglosphere]] and was soon mistaken for a new type of verificationism,<ref name=Popper/><ref name=Hacohen/> yet refuted verificationism.<ref name=Epstein/><ref name=Popper/><ref name=Hacohen/>  Falsificationism's [[problem of demarcation|demarcation]] ''[[falsifiable]]'' grants a theory the status ''scientific''<U+2014>simply, empirically ''testable''<U+2014>not the status ''meaningful'', a status that Popper did not aim to arbiter.<ref name=Popper>Karl Popper, ch 4, subch "Science: Conjectures and refutations", in Andrew Bailey, ed, ''First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy'', 2<sup>nd</sup> edn (Peterborough Ontario: [[Broadview Press]], 2011), [http://books.google.com/books?id=ngXNqiH_cDQC&pg=PA338&dq=Wittenstein+verifiability#v=twopage pp 338<U+2013>42].</ref>  Popper found no scientific theory either verifiable or, as in [[Rudolph Carnap|Carnap]]'s "liberalization of empiricism", confirmable,<ref name=Popper/><ref name=Godfrey-Smith>Peter Godfrey-Smith, ''Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), [http://books.google.com/books?id=k23egtSWrb8C&pg=PA57 p 57<U+2013>59].</ref> and found unscientific, metaphysical, ethical, and aesthetic statements often rich in meaning while also underpinning or fueling science as the origin of scientific theories.<ref name=Popper/><ref>Falsificationism is simply Popper's ''scientific'' epistemology, whereas [[critical rationalism]] is Popper's ''general'' [[epistemology]].</ref>

[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]]'s landmark book of 1962, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''<U+2014>which identified ''[[normal science|paradigms of science]]'' overturned by [[revolutionary science]] within [[fundamental interactions|fundamental physics]], that is, [[fundamental science]]<U+2014>critically destabilized confidence in scientific [[foundationalism]],<ref>Samir Okasha, ''Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002) ch 5.</ref> commonly if erroneously attributed to verificationism.<ref>"But for a brief lapse around 1929/30, then, the post-''[[The Logical Structure of the World|Aufbau]]'' [[Rudolf Carnap|Carnap]] fully represents the position of [[Vienna Circle]] anti-foundationalism. In this he joined [[Otto Neurath|Neurath]] whose long-standing anti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile likening scientists to sailors who have to repair their [[Neurath's boat|boat]] without ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions contrasted at least ''[[prima facie]]'' with that of [[Moritz Schlick|Schlick]] (1934) who explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle's protocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all scientific statements were [[fallibilism|fallible]] ones, so his position on [[foundationalism]] was by no means the traditional one. The point of his 'foundations' remained less than wholly clear and different interpretation of it have been put forward. ... While all in the [[Vienna Circle|Circle]] thus recognized as futile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge claims, not all members embraced positions that rejected foundationalism ''[[tout court]]''. Clearly, however, attributing [[foundationalist]] ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total misunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development, if it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist faction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left wing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both the empirical and [[formal science]]s" [Thomas Uebel, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/vienna-circle "Vienna Circle"], sec "3.3 Reductionism and foundationalism: Two criticisms partly rebutted", in Edward N Zalta, ed, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Summer 2012 edn)].</ref>  Popper, who had long claimed to have killed verificationism but recognized that some would confuse his falsificationism for more of it,<ref name=Hacohen>Malachi Haim Hacohen, ''Karl Popper: The Formative Years, 1902-1945: Politics and Philosophy in Interwar Vienna'' (Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2000), [http://books.google.com/books?id=3VtHcYGp2pIC&pg=PA212&dq=Habermas+broad+Popper+killed+logical+positivism#v=twopage pp 212<U+2013>13].</ref> was [[knighted]] in 1965.  At 1967, [[John Passmore]], a leading historian of 20<sup>th</sup>-century philosophy, wrote, "Logical positivism is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"<U+2014>a general view among philosophers.<ref name=Hanfling>Oswald Hanfling, ch 5 "Logical positivism", in Stuart G Shanker, ''Philosophy of Science, Logic and Mathematics in the Twentieth Century'' (London: [[Routledge]], 1996), [http://books.google.com/books?id=jIzT7AT3ILIC&pg=PA193#v=twopage pp 193<U+2013>94].</ref>  Logical positivism's fall heralded [[postpositivism]], where Popper's view of human knowledge as hypothetical, continually growing, and open to change ascended,<ref name=Hacohen/> and verificationism became mostly maligned.<ref name=Misak/>

==Aftermath==
Although [[Karl Popper]]'s [[falsificationism]] became soon widely criticized by philosophers, Popper has been the only [[philosopher of science]] often praised by scientists,<ref name=Godfrey-Smith/> whereas [[logical positivists|verificationists]] have been likened to [[economists]] of the 19<sup>th</sup> century who took circuitous, protracted measures to refuse falsification, that is, refutation, of their preconceived principles.<ref>Mark Blaug ''The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain'', 2<sup>nd</sup> edn (Cambridge UK: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1992), ch 3 "The verificationists, a largely nineteenth-century story", [http://books.google.com/books?id=T4y7HyduGnIC&pg=PA51&dq=verificationists p 51].</ref>  Still, logical positivists practiced Popper's principles<U+2014>conjecturing and refuting<U+2014>until they ran their course, catapulting Popper, initially a contentious misfit, to carry the richest philosophy out of [[interwar]] Vienna.<ref name=Hacohen/>  And his [[falsificationism]], as did verificationism, poses a criterion, ''[[falsifiability]]'', to ensure that [[empiricism]] anchors [[scientific theory]].<ref name=Misak/>

In a 1979 interview, [[A. J. Ayer|A J Ayer]], who had introduced logical positivism to the [[Anglosphere]] in the 1930s, was asked what he saw as its main defects, and answered that "nearly all of it was false".<ref name=Hanfling/>  Still, he soon admitted still holding "the same general approach".<ref name=Hanfling/>  The "general approach" of [[empiricism]] and [[reductionism]]<U+2014>whereby mental phenomena resolve to the material or physical, and philosophical questions largely resolve to ones of language and meaning<U+2014>has run through Western philosophy since the 17<sup>th</sup> century and lived beyond logical positivism's fall.<ref name=Hanfling/>  In 1977, Ayer had noted, "The verification principle is seldom mentioned and when it is mentioned it is usually scorned; it continues, however, to be put to work.  The attitude of many philosophers reminds me of the relationship between Pip and Magwitch in [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.  They have lived on the money, but are ashamed to acknowledge its source".<ref name=Misak/>  Nearing the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the vague concept of verification criteria<U+2014>in varying forms varying from [[logical positivist]]s' verificationism<U+2014>was in some rehabilitation by [[Bas van Fraassen]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Crispin Wright]], [[Christopher Peacocke]], [[David Wiggins]], [[Richard Rorty]], and others.<ref name=Misak>C J Misak, ''Verificationism: Its History and Prospects'' (New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [http://books.google.com/books?id=EObr91F6rJ8C&pg=PR8 p viii].</ref>
