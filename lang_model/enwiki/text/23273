==Personal life==

Donald Findlay was born on 17 March 1951 in [[Cowdenbeath]], [[Fife]], the son of a church beadle. He was subsequently educated at [[Harris Academy]] in [[Dundee]], and later at the [[University of Dundee]] and at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His academic links with the [[University of St Andrews]] (of which Dundee was once part) saw him elected as Lord Rector in 1993 and again in 1996. After his retirement from this position, he took the position of Chancellor of the University's [[Strafford Club of the University of St Andrews|Strafford Club]]. St Andrews, allegedly, dropped plans to award him an [[honorary degree]] after one of his controversial outbursts. At this time, he was also noted to be suffering from severe depression and later revealed that he had contemplated suicide.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/476302.stm Song row QC considered suicide], ''[[BBC News]]''</ref>

Findlay is also an [[atheist]].<ref name="Scotsman.com News">[http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=594022005 Scotsman.com News<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|February 2010|date=February 2010}}</ref>  In the mid 1990s he left his third wife Jennie to set up house with the ''[[Reporting Scotland]]'' television reporter Paddy Christie.

In May 2011 Findlay was sent a parcel in the post to Cowdenbeath football club where he is chairman.<ref name="parcel">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13412933|title=Suspicious package sent to Scottish club Cowdenbeath |date=May 17, 2011|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref>  Initially it was thought to contain a bomb but it was later revealed to contain a knife.<ref name="parcel" />

==Career==
A combination of high-profile controversies, acute legal skills and a well-cultivated image has generated Findlay a lot of coverage in the Scottish press in recent years and he now has one of the highest legal profiles in Scotland and widely considered to be Scotland's premier criminal law [[advocate]].<ref name="Scotsman.com News"/> He took silk, becoming a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1988,<ref>{{cite web|author=Mackinnon Stable clerks/webmaster|title=Mackinnon Stable Members|publisher=Faculty of Advocates|url=http://www.advocates.org.uk/stables/ST011members.html|accessdate = 5 May 2007}}</ref> but his behaviour has been censured by the [[Faculty of Advocates]] on more than one occasion (see below). He has served as a defence [[lawyer]] in many high-profile murder cases including [[Jodi Jones]], [[Mark Scott]] and the [[Murder of Kriss Donald|Kriss Donald]] murder trials. He represented [[Peter Tobin]], the murderer of [[Angelika Kluk]] in the so-called "body in the church" case.<ref>.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/6623821.stm Tobin guilty of Angelika's murder], ''BBC News''</ref> Findlay is a member of the [[Mackinnon stables]].

In 2006 he was a defence counsel in the trial of [[Mohammed Atif Siddique]], which saw the youth sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for collecting and sharing online information about terrorists. Donald Findlay successfully appealed this conviction in January 2010. In April 2010 following an eight week trial he secured the acquittal of the English solicitor Marshall Ronald in the infamous Da Vinci recovery trial. 

[[Glasgow]] based newspaper [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] reported that Donald Findlay was one of the highest paid lawyers in 2007, earning <U+00A3>350,000 from his high profile cases.

In June 2010 Findlay was elected chairman of the Faculty of Advocates Criminal Bar Association.<ref>.[http://www.scotsman.com/news/Interview--Donald-Findlay-QC.6386759.jp Interview: Donald Findlay, QC], ''The Scotsman''</ref>

==Controversies==
Findlay is an [[atheism|atheist]], but is mostly noted in Scotland for his support of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], a historically [[Protestant]] football club, and for engaging in controversial behaviour that has been widely interpreted as being [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] in nature.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/><ref name="iht.com"/><ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/><ref name="news.scotsman.com"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050606/ai_n14656016|title=Leading QC pays price for anti-Catholic gaffe... yet again|accessdate=22 June 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/359039.stm|title= BBC News: The Bitter Divide |accessdate=8 April 2007| date=2 June 1999}}</ref>

In May 1999 he was accused of sectarianism, after being filmed singing [[The Sash]] at a private party organised by a Rangers Supporters Club, following the [[1999 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup Final]] in which Rangers beat Celtic 1-0.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=findlay-in-bigot-rap-&method=full&objectid=18471251&siteid=66633-name_page.html Daily Record]{{Dead link|February 2010|date=February 2010}}</ref> For his role in this event, Findlay was forced to resign from the Board of Rangers FC.

In May 2005, shortly after the death of [[Pope John Paul II]], while speaking at [[Larne]] Rangers Social Club in [[Northern Ireland]] he said "It's very smoky in here tonight - has another fucking [[Pope]] died?" ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported that he went on to tell a vulgar joke about a nun, while ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' reported that his routine was "alleged to have been littered with obscenities and jokes about Catholics" although Findlay has stated that he also made jokes about [[Protestantism]] and about the Protestant clergyman and politician [[Ian Paisley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishchristian.com/news/catholic/2005_05_01_archive.shtml|title=Reported by ScottishChristian.com|accessdate=28 June 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061019173637/http://www.scottishchristian.com/news/catholic/2005_05_01_archive.shtml |archivedate = October 19, 2006}}</ref> It is believed that the [[Faculty of Advocates]] passed a vote of no confidence on him following the controversy over his comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalonline.co.uk/news/1001937.aspx|title=Findlay quits over Pope joke|accessdate=22 June 2006}}</ref> He was also fined <U+00A3>3,500 by the Faculty of Advocates.
