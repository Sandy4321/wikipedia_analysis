==High school and college==
S<U+00E1>nchez attended Blanca Malaret High School in [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]], [[Puerto Rico]]. After graduating in 2000, S<U+00E1>nchez pitched for four seasons at [[Ohio Dominican University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. While at the university, S<U+00E1>nchez threw four [[no-hitter|no-hitters]] and set school records for most strikeouts in a single game (sixteen), most strikeouts in a single season (105), most strikeouts in a career (311), and most shutouts in a career (ten).<ref name="MLB"/> 

==Draft and minor league career==
S<U+00E1>nchez was selected by the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the twenty-seventh round (820th overall) of the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft|2004 MLB Draft]]. He enjoyed a fine start to his professional career in 2004, as he went 7-1 with a 3.72 ERA in fifteen games (nine were starts) with the [[Rookie]] league [[Arizona League Giants]] and the [[Single-A]] (short-season) [[Salem-Keizer Volcanoes]]. While pitching in the Arizona League, he tied for third in the league in wins, with five.<ref name="MLB"/>

S<U+00E1>nchez was promoted to the [[Single-A]] [[Augusta GreenJackets]] of the [[South Atlantic League]] in 2005. He only went 5-7 with a 4.08 ERA in twenty-five starts, but he led the [[South Atlantic League]] in strikeouts with 166, averaged 11.9 in nine innings pitched, and was selected to the league's All-star team. During the offseason, S<U+00E1>nchez pitched for the Carolina club of the [[Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League]], posting a 2-2 record with a 2.91 ERA in 19 relief appearances.<ref name="MLB"/>

Coming into 2006, S<U+00E1>nchez was ranked as the sixth best prospect in the Giants' organization by Baseball America.<ref>{{citation |last=Manuel |first=John |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/features/05top10s/giants.html |title=Top Ten Prospects: San Francisco Giants |publisher=Baseball America |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> He began the 2006 season with the [[Double-A]] [[Connecticut Defenders]], where in thirteen appearances (three starts) he went 2-1 with a 1.15 ERA and forty-six strikeouts.

==Major Leagues==
===2006===
After such an impressive performance at [[Double-A]], S<U+00E1>nchez was called up to the Giants on May 26, {{mlby|2006}}. He made his [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] debut two days later on May 28 against the [[Colorado Rockies]]. He pitched one [[inning]] in relief and retired all three batters he faced ([[Todd Helton]], [[Matt Holliday]], and [[Garrett Atkins]]).<ref>{{citation |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/y2006/gd.html?2006_05_28_colmlb_sfnmlb_1 |title=Colorado 6, San Francisco 3 |publisher=MLB |date=2006-05-28 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> His performance went relatively unnoticed, however, because [[Barry Bonds]] hit his 715th home run in the same game to surpass [[Babe Ruth]] for second place on the all-time home run list.<ref>{{citation |last=Bloom |first=Barry |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060502&content_id=1428993&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Bonds passes Babe with 715 homers |publisher=MLB |date=2006-05-28 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

On June 4, S<U+00E1>nchez picked up his first major league win. With the score tied at six in the eleventh inning against the [[New York Mets]], S<U+00E1>nchez entered the game and pitched a scoreless inning. The Giants won the game 7-6 in the twelfth, giving S<U+00E1>nchez his first major league victory.<ref>{{citation |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Mike |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=260604121 |title=Giants 7, Mets 6, 12 innings |publisher=Yahoo! sports |date=2006-06-04 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

S<U+00E1>nchez posted a 2&ndash;0 record with a 1.37 ERA in twenty-two games in his first stint with the team. On July 29, the Giants sent him to their [[AAA (baseball)|AAA]] affiliate, the [[Fresno Grizzlies]], to improve his abilities as a starter.<ref name="MLB"/> He did very well with Fresno, going 2-2 with a 3.80 ERA in six starts. With the expansion of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] rosters on September 1, S<U+00E1>nchez was recalled from Fresno.<ref>{{citation |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/transactions/_/name/sf/year/2006/san-francisco-giants |title=San Francisco Giants Transactions - 2006 |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>

S<U+00E1>nchez won his first major league start on September 6, giving up one run in 5<U+2154> innings pitched in a 3&ndash;2 victory over the [[Cincinnati Reds]].<ref>{{citation |last=Kinney |first=Terry |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=260906117 |title=Giants 3, Reds 2 |publisher=Yahoo! sports |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref> Unfortunately, S<U+00E1>nchez did not pitch well in his last four appearances of the season (three were starts), as he had an 11.36 ERA in them.<ref name="MLB"/>

===2007===
Entering the 2007 season, S<U+00E1>nchez was ranked as the second best prospect in the Giants' organization (behind only [[Tim Lincecum]]) by [[Baseball America]].<ref>{{citation |last=Baggarly |first=Andy |url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/features/263377.html |title=Top 10 Prospects: San Francisco Giants |publisher=Baseball America| date=2007-02-22| accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> S<U+00E1>nchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training for the first time in his career. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when [[Russ Ortiz]] came off the [[disabled list]].<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070521&content_id=1978749&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Notes: Giants go to the dogs |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> S<U+00E1>nchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, [[Russ Ortiz|Ortiz]] got hurt again.<ref>{{citation |last=Grey |first=Jason |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070607&content_id=2012653&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Notes: Ortiz headed to the disabled list |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> On June 13, he picked up his first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7-4 loss to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270613126 |title=Jays tag Giants phenom Lincecum with seven runs |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> On July 4, he was placed on the [[disabled list]] with a strained rib cage,<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070704&content_id=2066639&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Notes: Atchison back in Majors |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> but he was reactivated on July 18.<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070719&content_id=2096822&vkey=news_sf&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Notes: Misch returned to Triple-A |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref>

In 2008, S<U+00E1>nchez made the Giants' starting rotation out of spring training as the fifth starter.<ref>{{citation |last=Addcox |first=Jayson |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080330&content_id=2467026&vkey=spt2008gamer&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Starters have mixed results vs. A's |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2008-03-30 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}</ref> In only his second start of the season, he struck out a career high ten batters against the [[San Diego Padres]] in a game the Giants eventually won 1-0.<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080409&content_id=2510314&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Ortmeier's heroics provide margin |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> S<U+00E1>nchez struck out ten batters again in a 3-1 victory against the [[Cincinnati Reds]] on April 25, becoming the first Giants left-handed pitcher since [[Shawn Estes]] to strike out at least ten batters in a game more than once in a season.<ref name="reds">{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080425&content_id=2588092&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Sanchez racks up K's in win vs. Reds |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> From May 28 through June 12, S<U+00E1>nchez won a career best four straight starts.<ref name="MLB"/> On June 12, in a 10-7 victory over the [[Colorado Rockies]], he became the first Giants' starter to allow seven runs and win a game since [[Russ Ortiz]] did it in 2000.<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080612&content_id=2900786&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Giants bats come alive in win vs. Rox |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> In his next start, on June 17 against the [[Detroit Tigers]], S<U+00E1>nchez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he was ultimately the losing pitcher in a 5-1 loss.<ref>{{citation |last=Haft |first=Chris |url=http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080617&content_id=2946836&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sf |title=Giant's can't pick up Sanchez |publisher=San Francisco Giants |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref> S<U+00E1>nchez finished the first half with an 8-5 record and 115 strikeouts, which were the most ever in the first half of a season by a Giants' left-hander during the Giants' tenure in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].<ref name="MLB"/>

The second half did not go well for S<U+00E1>nchez, though.

===2009===
S<U+00E1>nchez was again the fifth starter in the Giants' rotation in 2009.

S<U+00E1>nchez didn't stay in the bullpen very long though.
