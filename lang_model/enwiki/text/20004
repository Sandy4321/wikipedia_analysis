'''Monkey bike''' is the name given to various small, low-powered [[motorcycles]] first made popular by [[Honda]] in the 1970s. These vehicles are typically 50-90cc, with a single cylinder [[four-stroke engine]], and have a seat height of 24 inches (60&nbsp;cm) or less. This gives the rider a crouched appearance, making him look like a stylized image of a squatting [[monkey]].

Numerous similar designs predate the Honda model, notably the [[World War II]] parachutist motorcycles such as the [[Welbike]], but these were not commonly known by this name until the Honda design made the type of vehicle commonplace.

The "Dax" model is a 2 seat variant.

In [[Japan]], the small size of the vehicle and the availability of [[Engine tuning|tuning]] parts has led to a sub-culture of "racing" monkey bikes, with large amounts of money being spent for minute horsepower gains.

Monkey bikes are utilised by various companies in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] operating driver-only taxi services, typically aimed at customers who have consumed [[Driving under the influence|too much alcohol]] to be able to drive themselves home safely or legally.  A driver arrives on a monkey bike and stows this in the customer's own [[Automobile|vehicle]].  The customer is then driven home; the drivers are  [[Vehicle_insurance#United_Kingdom|comprehensively insured]] to drive most types of vehicle.  Upon arrival at the customer's destination the driver reassembles the bike and continues.
