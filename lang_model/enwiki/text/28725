The second largest city is [[Santiago de Cuba]].<ref name = "BBC profile">{{cite web |title= Cuba profile: Facts |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19583446 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 26 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name = "Thomas 1998 ?">{{Harvnb|Thomas|1998|p=?}}.</ref><ref name = "Thomas 1997 ?">{{Harvnb|Thomas|1997|p=?}}.</ref> To the north of Cuba lies the [[United States]] (150&nbsp;km or 93&nbsp;mi away) and the [[Bahamas]], [[Mexico]] is to the west, the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Jamaica]] are to the south, and [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] are to the southeast.

The island of Cuba was inhabited by numerous Mesoamerican tribes prior to its invasion by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, who claimed it for the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Cuba remained a colony of Spain until the [[Spanish<U+2013>American War]] of 1898, after which it was briefly administered by the United States until gaining [[Platt Amendment|nominal independence]] in 1902. The fragile republic endured increasingly radical politics and social strife, and despite efforts to [[Cuban Constitution of 1940|strengthen its democratic system]], Cuba came under the dictatorship of former president [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/JFK+Pre-Pres/1960/002PREPRES12SPEECHES_60OCT06b.htm |title=Remarks of Senator John F.

Since 1965, the country has been governed as a [[single-party state]] by the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], remaining one of the world's four self-declared [[socialist state]]s.

Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, and with over 11 million inhabitants, is the second-most populous after [[Hispaniola]], albeit with a much lower population density than most nations in the region. A multiethnic country, its [[Cubans|people]], [[Culture of Cuba|culture]], and customs derive from diverse origins, including the aboriginal [[Ta<U+00ED>no people|Ta<U+00ED>no]] and [[Ciboney]] peoples, the long period of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonialism]], the introduction of [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|African slaves]], a close [[Cuba-Soviet relations|relationship with the Soviet Union]] during the Cold War, and close proximity to the United States.

Cuba ranks high in metrics of [[health]] and [[education]], with a high [[Human Development Index]] of 0.783 as of 2012. According to data it presents to the [[United Nations]], Cuba was the only nation in the world in 2006 that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]], with an [[ecological footprint]] of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5 hectares, and a [[Human Development Index]] of over 0.855.<ref>{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development]</ref>

According describe Letters Indies, once Columbus set foot on Cuban soil, knelt in the sand and with the head tilted up said: "This is the most beautiful land that human eyes have ever seen."

Article 136 states: "In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts".<ref name=constitution/> Votes are cast by [[secret ballot]] and counted in public view. Nominees are chosen at local gatherings from multiple candidates before gaining approval from election committees. In the subsequent election, there is only one candidate for each seat, who must gain a majority to be elected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

No [[List of political parties in Cuba|political party]] is permitted to nominate candidates or campaign on the island, including the Communist Party.<ref>[http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/cuba/1990.html Cuba: Elections and Events 1991-2001] Latin American Election Statistics Home</ref> The Communist Party of Cuba has held six party congress meetings since 1975. In 2011, the party stated that there were 800,000 members, and representatives generally constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, while activity within Cuba by [[opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition groups]] is minimal.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Cuba|Municipalities of Cuba}}
The country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del R<U+00ED>o, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camag<U+00FC>ey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cuba}}
[[File:Cuba rel94.jpg|thumb|A general map of Cuba.]]
Cuba is an [[archipelago]] of islands located in the northern [[Caribbean Sea]] at the confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19<U+00B0>]] and [[24th parallel north|24<U+00B0>N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74<U+00B0>]] and [[85th meridian west|85<U+00B0>W]]. The United States lies 90 miles across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] to the north.

[[Haiti]] is to the east, [[Jamaica]] and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south, and [[Mexico]] to the west. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camag<U+00FC>ey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.

The main island named Cuba is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).

The second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Cuba has a total area of {{convert|109884|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Its area is {{convert|110860|km2|abbr=on|0}} including coastal and territorial waters.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Cuba}}
[[File:Valle vinales 1.jpg|thumb|[[Vi<U+00F1>ales Valley]].]]
With most of the island south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba, but has a subtropical climate instead of a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|<U+00B0>C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|<U+00B0>C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. These are most common in September and October.

===Biodiversity===
Cuba signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 12 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 8 March 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |date=|accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], with one revision which was received by the convention on 24 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nbsap-v2-es.pdf |title=Plan de Acci&oacute;n Nacional 2006/2010 sobre la Diversidad Biol&oacute;gica. Rep&uacute;blica de Cuba |date=|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>

The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery. There is, however, virtually no information in that document about biodiversity itself. The country's fourth national report to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]], however, contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: [[animal]]s (17,801 species), [[bacteria]] (270 species), [[chromista]] (707 species), [[fungi]], including [[lichen]]-forming species (5844 species), [[plant]]s (9107 species) and [[protozoa]] (1440 species).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nr-04-es.pdf |title=IV Informe Nacional al Convento sobre la Diversidad Biol&oacute;gica. Rep&uacute;blica de Cuba. 2009 |date=|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>

As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented. The numbers recorded from Cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers which actually occur in Cuba. For most if not all of the other groups, however, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, often considerably, the numbers of those recorded so far.

According to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women.<ref name="cubacensus2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/anuario_2010/anuario_demografico_2010.pdf |title=ANUARIO DEMOGRAFICO DE CUBA 2010 |publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas}}</ref> Its [[birth rate]] (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070926222652/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&subsection=Americas&month=May2007&file=World_News2007051741913.xml |title=Population, birth rate falling in Cuba: Official |publisher=The Peninsula On-line |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> is one of the lowest in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961, the rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, with a fertility rate of 1.43 children per woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20090113074404/http://www.periodico26.cu/english/features/june2008/cuba-population060508.html |title=Population Decrease Must be Reverted |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref>

Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere,<ref>{{cite web|year=1997|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/pubsarchive/fer/ffer.htm|title=United Nations World Fertility Patterns 1997|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref> and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of contraceptives is also widespread, estimated at 79 percent of the female population (in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html|title=The Incidence of Abortion Worldwide|author=Stanley K.

===Ethnoracial groups===
Cuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and subsequently there is a discrepancy regarding the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62 percent of Cubans are black,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|title=A barrier for Cuba's blacks|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref> the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05 percent, was white.

[[File:Young Boys in School Uniform - Pinar del Rio - Cuba.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Young boys in school uniform with soccer ball, [[Pinar del R<U+00ED>o]], December 2006.]]
In fact, the [[Minority Rights Group International]] determined that "An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 33.9 per cent to 62 per cent".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d342c.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples <U+2013> Cuba: Afro-Cubans}}</ref>

[[Asian people|Asians]] make up about one percent of the population, and are largely of [[Chinese Cuban|Chinese ancestry]], followed by [[Filipinos]], [[Koreans]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]. Many are descendants of farm laborers brought to the island by Spanish and American contractors during the 19th and early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[Afro-Cubans]] are descended primarily from the [[Kongo people]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2009|reason=Unreliable source removed: joshuaproject.net}} as well as several thousand [[North Africa]]n refugees, most notably the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi Arabs]] of [[Western Sahara]].<ref>{{cite web|date=31 March 2006|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20061125161820/http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20061125161820/http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816|archivedate=2006-11-25|title=Sahrawi children inhumanely treated in Cuba, former Cuban official|publisher=MoroccoTimes.com|accessdate=2006-07-09}} (archived from [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20061125161820/http://www.moroccotimes.com/Paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=13816 the original] on 2006-11-25)</ref>

===Immigration and emigration===
{{Main|Spanish immigration to Cuba}}
Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarian]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]], [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1899 and 1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |title=La inmigraci<U+00F3>n entre 1902 y 1920 |publisher=Tau.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref> Other prominent immigrant groups included French,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees |title=Etat des propri<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s rurales appartenant <U+00E0> des Fran<U+00E7>ais dans l'<U+00EE>le de Cuba |publisher=Cuban Genealogy Center |date=2007-07-10 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[British people|British]], and [[Irish people|Irish]], as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a [[Cuban exile|large and influential diaspora community]]. During the three decades since January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes <U+2014> constituting 10 percent of the total population <U+2014> [[Cuban migration to Miami|emigrated to the United States]], a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://immigration-online.org/77-cuban-immigration.html |title=Cuban immigration - North American Immigration |publisher=Immigration-online.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref><ref name = "Pedraza 2007 ?">{{Harvnb|Pedraza|2007|p=?}}.</ref><ref name = "Falk 1988 74">{{Harvnb|Falk|1988|p=74}}: "[A] tenth of the entire Caribbean population has .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. Between 30,000 and 80,000 Cubans are estimated to have died trying to flee Cuba.<ref name="Power Kills"/> On 9 September 1994, the U.S. and Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95211.pdf|title=CUBA: U.S. Response to the 1994 Cuban Migration Crisis|publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office|date=September 1995|accessdate=2009-09-14}}</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Cuba}}
[[File:2012-Catedral de San Cristobal anagoria 01.JPG|thumb|[[Cathedral of Havana]].]]
In 2010, the religious affiliation of the country was estimated by the [[Pew Forum]] to be 59.2 percent Christian (mostly [[Roman Catholic]]), 23.0 percent unaffiliated, 17.4 percent [[folk religion]] (such as [[santer<U+00ED>a]]), and the remaining 0.4 percent consisting of other religions.<ref name=pewrel>{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-tables.pdf|work=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious freedom increased through the 1980s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1996|p=105}}: "The expansion of religious liberty began more than a decade ago, for example, and Cuban citizens, by and large, are free to practice their faiths without fear of persecution."</ref> with the government finally amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.<ref name = "Dom<U+00ED>nguez 2003 4">{{Harvnb|Dom<U+00ED>nguez|2003|p=4}}.</ref>

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religion, with its origins rooted in Spanish colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith.<ref name=catholic>{{cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php|title=Catholic church in Cuba strives to re-establish the faith|author=David Einhorn|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|date=31 March 2006|accessdate=2009-09-07}}</ref>

The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by [[syncretisms]] of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with [[Santer<U+00ED>a]], a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of ''Cobre'') is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santer<U+00ED>a, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Oshun]].

Cuba also hosts small communities of Jews, Muslims, and members of the Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith.<ref>{{cite web|year=2005|month=June 13|url=http://news.bahai.org/story.cfm?storyid=377|title=Government officials visit Baha'i center|publisher=Baha'iWorldNewsService.com}}</ref>

===Languages===
The official language of Cuba is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the vast majority of Cubans speak it. Spanish as spoken in Cuba is known as [[Cuban Spanish]] and is a form of [[Caribbean Spanish]]. [[Lucumi language|Lucumi]], a dialect of the West African language [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], is also used as a [[liturgical language]] by practitioners of [[Santer<U+00ED>a]],<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Tndbo3yLEdcC&dq=lucumi+language |title=Santeria from Africa to the New World |author=George Brandon |page=56 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21114-9 |date=1997-03-01}}</ref> and so only as a second language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=luq |title=Lucumi: A Language of Cuba (Ethnologue) |accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref> [[Haitian Creole]] is the second largest language in Cuba, and is spoken by [[Haitians|Haitian]] immigrants and their descendants.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10130814 |title=Cuban Creole choir brings solace to Haiti's children |accessdate=10 March 2010 | work=BBC News}}</ref> Other languages spoken by immigrants include [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Corsican language|Corsican]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CU |title=Languages of Cuba |accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref>

Cuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain and Africa. After the 1959 revolution, the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education to all and established rigorous sports, ballet and music programs.<ref name=hsas>{{cite web|title=For Cuba, a Harsh Self-Assessment|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/americas/harsh-self-assessment-as-cuba-looks-within.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&ref=world|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports which are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally promoted in other Spanish-speaking nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is by far the most popular; other sports and pastimes include [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[track and field athletics|athletics]]. Cuba is a dominant force in [[amateur boxing]], consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions. Cuba also provides a [[Cuba at the Olympics|national team]] that competes in the [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/cuba |title=Cuba &#124; Comit<U+00E9> Ol<U+00ED>mpico Cubano &#124; National Olympic Committee |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}</ref>

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Cuba}}
[[File:Casa de la Trova Santiago Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|A local musical house, Casa de la Trova in Santiago de Cuba]]
Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of culture. The central form of this music is [[Son (music)|Son]], which has been the basis of many other musical styles like [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and an upbeat derivation of the rumba, the [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]].

Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.

During that time, [[reggaet<U+00F3>n]] was growing in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced "low-profile" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani Garc<U+00ED>a]], characterizing its description of sex as "the sort which a prostitute would carry out".<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being "Sexually Explict" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666#.UMJho3ewWSq |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and "Sexually Explicit" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}
[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]
Cuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.

The typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.

===Literature===
{{Main|Cuban literature}}
Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by Jos<U+00E9> Mart<U+00ED>, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Guill<U+00E9>n]] and [[Jose Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce Mar<U+00ED>a Loynaz]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica <U+2013> Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Verify credibility|date=September 2009}}</ref>

Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Da<U+00ED>na Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Guti<U+00E9>rrez]], [[Zo<U+00E9> Vald<U+00E9>s]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.

Higher education is provided by universities, higher institutes, higher [[pedagogical]] institutes, and higher [[polytechnic]] institutes. The Cuban Ministry of Higher Education operates a scheme of distance education which provides regular afternoon and evening courses in rural areas for agricultural workers. Education has a strong political and ideological emphasis, and students progressing to higher education are expected to have a commitment to the goals of Cuba.<ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org" /> Cuba has provided state subsidized education to a limited number of foreign nationals at the [[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19942866/ |title=Students graduate from Cuban school <U+2013> Americas <U+2013> MSNBC.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-25 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6914265.stm|title=Cuba-trained US doctors graduate|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=2009-09-07 | work=BBC News}}</ref>
