'''Eunus''' (d. [[132 BC]]), a slave from [[Apamea]] in [[Syria]], became leader of the slave uprising in the [[First Servile War]] in [[Sicily]]. Eunus rose to prominence in the movement through his reputation as a wonder-worker and prophet. In addition to his ability to blow fire from his mouth, Eunus claimed to receive visions and communications from the goddess [[Atargatis]], a prominent goddess in his homeland, whom he came to identify with Sicilian [[Demeter]]. One of his prophetic predictions was that the rebel slaves would successfully capture the city of [[Enna]].

[[Eunus]] participated in the storming of [[Enna]], standing in the front ranks and blowing fire from his mouth. Upon the capture of [[Enna]], Eunus was crowned king. He subsequently took the name Antiochus, a name used by the [[Seleucids]] who ruled [[Syria]], and called his followers, who numbered around 70,000, his ''Syrians''. After the slave army was defeated by a Roman army under the leadership of [[Perperna]], Eunus, with members of his "court," took refuge in a cavern, where he was subsequently captured.

Most of the literary evidence for Eunus and the First Servile War comes from the writings of [[Diodorus Siculus]], who used [[Posidonius]] as his primary source. [[Florus]]' ''Epitome'', which provides excerpts from lost portions of [[Livy]] is the most detailed Latin account. Both Diodorus and Posidonius were sympathetic to the Romans. Diodorus lived in [[Rome]] and [[Cicero]] asked Posidonius to write an account of the former's consulate. Since Eunus was a defeated enemy of Rome, their accounts of both the slave uprising and its leader were likely biased. On the other hand, [[Posidonius]], like Eunus, was from Syrian [[Apamea]], and the details about Eunus' worship of [[Atargatis]] probably arise from his personal knowledge of the goddess's mendicant priests.

Archaeologists have found a small bronze coin, minted at Enna, which bears the inscription "king Antiochus." It is likely that the Antiochus in question is Eunus.
