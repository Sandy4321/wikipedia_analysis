==Management==
The Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area is managed by the Boston Harbor Islands Partnership, a statutory body established as a federal operating committee by the park enabling legislation. The partnership consists of individual members who represent a range of federal, state, city, and nonprofit agencies, including:
 
* [[National Park Service|United States National Park Service]]
* [[United States Coast Guard]]
* [[Department of Conservation and Recreation (Massachusetts)|Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]]
* [[Massachusetts Port Authority]]
* [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]]
* [[City of Boston]]
* [[Boston Redevelopment Authority]]
* [[Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center]]
* [[The Trustees of Reservations]]

Additionally the partnership includes members representing the ''Island Alliance'', a fund-raising body dedicated to raising funds for the National Recreation Area, and the ''Boston Harbor Islands Advisory Council''. There are 13 members in total, together with 13 alternates. Apart from the representative for the Coast Guard, who is appointed by the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]], all the members of the partnership are appointed by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] after consultation with the appropriate agency or other body.<ref name=bhadm>{{cite web | title = Islands Partnership - Governance | url = http://www.bostonislands.org/manage/manage_admin_partner.html | publisher = Boston Harbor Islands Partnership | accessdate = October 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref name=bhmem>{{cite web | title = Islands Partnership - Membership | url = http://www.bostonislands.org/manage/manage_admin_partner2.html | publisher = Boston Harbor Islands Partnership | accessdate = October 6 | accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref name=bhleg>{{cite web | title =  Public Law 104-33, 110 Stat. 4093 Sec. 1029.
