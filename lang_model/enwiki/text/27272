The '''Pontiac Fiero''' is a [[Mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[sports car]] that was built by the [[Pontiac]] division of [[General Motors]] from 1984 to 1988. The Fiero<U+2014>meaning "proud" in Italian and "wild", "fierce", or "ferocious" in Spanish<U+2014>was designed by George Milidrag and [[Hulki Aldikacti]] as a Pontiac sports car. The Fiero was the first two-seater Pontiac since the 1926 to 1938 coupes, and also the first and only mass-produced mid-engine sports car by a U.S. manufacturer. Many technologies incorporated in the Fiero design such as plastic body panels were radical for its time. Alternative names considered for the car were Sprint, P3000, Pegasus, Fiamma, Sunfire, and Firebird XP.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Fiero ''2M4'' (2-seat, Mid-engine, 4-cylinder) was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1984. The 1984 Fiero was the Official Pace Car of the [[Indianapolis 500]] for 1984, beating out the new 1984 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] for the honor.

370,168 Fieros were produced over the relatively short production run of five years; by comparison, 163,000 [[Toyota MR2]]s were sold in its first five years.<ref name="spotters_guide">{{cite book |first=Mark |last=Corbin |title=Fiero Spotter's Guide |year=1996 |location=Galion, OH |edition=Second Edition}}</ref> At the time, its reputation suffered from criticisms over performance, reliability and safety issues. Today however, compared to less adventurous attempts at two-seaters such as the [[Ford EXP]], the unique style of the Fiero compared to other American cars has left it a cult following as a collectible car. It remains a popular chassis for rebodies and electric conversions.

==History==
Already selling the Corvette, [[General Motors]] management and accountants were opposed to investing in a second two-seater sports car. But in 1979, during the [[1979 energy crisis|oil crisis]], management saw a market opportunity for a fuel-efficient sporty commuter car, and design work on the Fiero commenced. To this end, it was fitted with a fuel efficient version of GM's 2.5&nbsp;L [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] [[GM Iron Duke engine|"Iron Duke"]] engine capable of {{convert|27|mpgus|abbr=on}} in the city and {{convert|40|mpgus|abbr=on}} on the highway with the economy-ratio transmission option. These figures are [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] test-circuit results, published by Pontiac, and confirmed from multiple sources.<ref name="mileage">{{cite book |last=Witzenburg |first=Gary |title=Fiero: Pontiacs Potent Mid-Engine Sports Car |publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers |location=Osceola, WI |year=1990}}</ref> It was impressive mileage for a 2.5-liter engine of the period, and still good by today's standards, but the three-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] reduced highway mileage to only {{convert|32|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}. With respect to fuel economy, the Fiero would appeal to a market niche for which the Corvette with its [[V8 engine]] was unsuitable.

A mid-engine layout was chosen as a way to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight to improve fuel efficiency, and also for its handling, traction, and braking benefits. The sports car potential of the mid-engine layout was not fully realized when the Fiero debuted. In line with its market position, the tires, brakes, and some suspension components were carried over from other GM economy cars (like the [[Chevrolet Citation]] and [[Chevrolet Chevette]]) so the Fiero could be priced appropriately. As a result, the handling and cornering abilities of the initial Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes (''Road & Track'' 1985). The public had high expectations for the Fiero with its mid-engine layout and futuristic styling, which resembles more exotic mid-engine sports cars costing much more. While initially garnering good reviews for its handling (Motor Trend 1984), the Fiero soon received disappointing reviews, as the automotive critics expected higher performance from a mid-engine two-seater. Despite the critical press, the Fiero sold extremely well and Pontiac operated three shifts at the factory during 1984, and could not keep up with initial demand.<ref name="speech" />

The sharing of [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components with other GM cars meant the rear suspension and [[powertrain]] was almost identical to that of the Chevrolet Citation and [[Pontiac Phoenix]]; the Fiero even included rear [[tie rod]] ends attached to a "steering knuckle", although these were hard-mounted to the engine cradle and only used for maintaining the rear tire alignment. The front suspension was derived from the Chevrolet Chevette, and Chevette enthusiasts found that they could upgrade their undersized front brakes and rotors using Fiero parts.

By 1985, the oil crisis was a thing of the past and demand developed for a Fiero having more engine power and better sports car performance. Pontiac responded by introducing the GT model which included upgraded suspension tuning, wider tires, and a V6 engine having {{convert|43|hp}} more than the base four-cylinder. In 1986, the GT model was restyled to look even more sleek.

Numerous changes were made to the 1988 Fiero. The most significant was a completely redesigned [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] (and parts of the space frame) to realize the potential of the mid-engine layout. Now unique to the Fiero, the new suspension included new two piece brake calipers and upgraded brake rotors for 1988.<ref name="CanadianDriver1">{{citation |url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/bv/fiero.htm |title=Motoring Memories: Pontiac Fiero, 1984<U+2013>1988 |publisher=Canadian Driver |date=May 3, 2004 |last=Vance |first=Bill}}</ref> The available [[Inline-four engine|I4]] and [[V6 engine|V6]] engines benefited from evolutionary improvements, but the planned availability of [[turbocharger]]s and newer [[DOHC]] engines did not happen before production ended.

Officially, production ended because of an internal GM forecast of insufficient future profits due to an expected decrease in overall demand for two-seater sports cars, however this decision was commensurate with heavy media coverage of [[#Engine fire reputation|Fiero engine fires]]. GM's forecast may have been a year premature, as the actual sales in 1988 were lower than prior years but still double the forecast.

==Production years==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

===1984===
[[File:Red84fieroSE.jpg|right|thumb|1984 Fiero SE]]
1984 was the first production year for the Pontiac Fiero, beginning production in August 1983. In an effort to sell the car as being economically sensible, GM equipped and sold the Fiero as a commuter car; however, the marketing build up leading to initial release indicated anything but a regular commuter. The car also proved uncomfortable for some drivers because of the lack of power steering.

1984 was the only year in which the Limited "Indy Pace Car" edition, consisting of an [[Indianapolis 500]]-themed option package on ''SE''-model vehicles, was offered (excepting 1985, in which the package was specially reissued). Approximately 2,000 of these vehicles were sold. The Indy had aero body cladding and new front and rear fascias that would be used on the 1985 GT. Only the underpowered four-cylinder engine was available, though a few prototypes could be seen driving around the Greater Detroit area with a unique periscope-style inlet sprouting from the engine compartment and curving up and over the roof.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} This "periscope" style inlet was used on the actual Indy Pace Car Fieros that appeared at the 1984 Indianapolis 500. This inlet scoop, and the 2.5-liter Super Duty engine that they fed, were not available on the production model pace car replicas.

===1985===
1985 saw the introduction of the GT model, which looked just like the 1984 Indy model without the decals or body color wheels. The problem with insufficient power was addressed, much to the satisfaction of the general public. A [[Chevrolet]] 2.8&nbsp;L V6 engine rated at {{convert|140|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|160|ftlb|abbr=on}}. was put into the car, satisfying most critics of the base engine. The High Output V6 was paired with a modified Muncie 4-speed transmission. The four-cylinder engine (known as the "Iron Duke") was now paired with the Japanese-designed [[Isuzu]] five-speed transmission (also produced at the [[Muncie, Indiana]] plant).

===1986===
[[File:Red86fierocoupe.jpg|right|thumb|1986 Fiero Coupe]]
1986 was the first year the fastback roofline was offered (sometimes wrongly referred to as a "1986<U+00BD>" model<U+2014>there was only one "GT" in 1986). Though originally conceived by Pontiac insiders as a new model, possibly called the "GTP" or "GTU," it has been said that GM management at the time felt that using "GTP" or "GTU" suggested a racing car and thus an image they did not want to promote. Individuals present at the unveiling of the new fastback roof style at a GM test track actually thought it was a new Corvette at first. But this new body style simply became the GT model for 1986 while the old 1985 GT body style became the SE model. Also offered late in the production year was a five-speed Muncie-Getrag transmission (coupled only to the V6 engines). Models equipped with the four-cylinder engine remained largely unchanged. The clutch hydraulic systems were redesigned with new master and slave cylinders.

===1987===
[[File:Fd gallery 05.jpg|right|thumb|Modified 1987 Pontiac Fiero GT fitted with aftermarket side scoops and Ferrari style front]]
1987 saw changes to the front and rear fascias on the "base coupe" with the SE & GT models keeping the same "Aero" nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black bumper chunks of the earlier models and had a smoother look. The four-cylinder engine's power rating increased to {{convert|98|hp|abbr=on}} with some major modifications which included a roller cam, redesigned intake manifold, distributorless ignition system [DIS], open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. The car was offered in Bright Metallic Blue and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT. Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade in the form of an "option" that changed the original body to a Ferrari-type body, called the Fiero Mera. While technically a "kit", the change in body style was offered only on new Fieros and is considered a class of car in its own right. There was a limited production of Fiero Meras made however, as the company that produced them, Corporate Concepts, was sued by [[Ferrari]] and ordered to stop.

===1988===
The 1988 Fiero brought a new suspension design, thought by many to have a striking resemblance to those designed by [[Lotus (car)|Lotus]], which at the time, was about to be acquired by General Motors. The suspension was never a Lotus design though: it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. In the back, the old Citation parts were replaced with a real tri-link suspension with all new knuckles. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with {{convert|15|in|mm|sing=on}} by {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on}} wide wheels up front and {{convert|15|in|mm|sing=on}} by {{convert|7|in|mm|sing=on}} wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed another common complaint of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic [[power steering]] unit, the same design later found on the [[GM EV1]], was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production - one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A "Formula" option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the {{convert|120|mph|-1|abbr=on}} speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero, and is also considered to be the best Fiero produced. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. Also 1988 was the only year a yellow exterior color was available from factory. During the Fiero's final model year, the [[Pontiac, Michigan]] plant, where the Fiero was built, was closed down.

===1990 (prototype)===
[[File:90 Proto (Small).JPG|left|thumb|1989/1990 Fiero Prototype, displayed at the 2006 Michigan Fiero Club show, "Fieros at the Hall".]]
[[File:90 Engine (Small).JPG|left|thumb|1989/1990 Fiero Prototype, Engine Bay.]]
[[File:90 dash pod (Small).JPG|right|thumb|1989/1990 Fiero Prototype, Interior.]]

A prototype of the never-produced 1990 Fiero was displayed at the 20th Anniversary show in July 2003, at Fierorama 2005, at the Michigan show in 2006 and most recently at the 25th Anniversary Show in Pontiac, Michigan in 2008. Continued showing of the prototype may no longer be an option in the near future, as GM has taken to cutting funding to relieve the pressure of its financial woes. As of 2011, the GM Heritage Center and the GM Archive do not have any record of the any 1989/1990 Fiero still being in GM's possession. Many of the 89/90 prototypes have been demolished in a scrap yard in Australia.

Much of its design influence is apparent in the [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation (1993<U+2013>2002)|Fourth Generation Firebird]]. New engines were proposed for the 1990 model year, from the then new DOHC {{convert|190|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} "Quad 4" four-cylinder as a base engine to replace the 2.5 Iron Duke to a new 200+ hp DOHC V-6 for the GT models. Even a 231 CID (3.8 L) Buick Turbo V6 powered Fiero is rumored to have been seen at a test track.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The single 1990 Fiero GT prototype had an early version of the upcoming DOHC V-6 that would be put into production in the [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Lumina Z34]] in the early 1990s. This engine developed more than {{convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}.

GM cited slumping and unprofitable sales of the Fiero as the reason for its demise following its 5th model year.

==Technical features==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}

===Suspension design===
The front end of the car is a wider direct derivative of the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common prior to the advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four [[ball joint]]s and four [[tie rod]] ends. Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade available from [[MOOG]] that replaces the upper ball joints with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.

The rear suspension is essentially a GM X-car's (Chevrolet Citation, Oldsmobile Omega and Pontiac Phoenix) front suspension moved to the rear of the Fiero. The uppers are top-plates and [[Chapman strut]]s, while the lowers are attached with ball joints. In lieu of the steering rack which would have been installed in an X-car, tie rod ends are attached to the engine cradle and used to align the rear wheels.

The four-wheel independent suspension provides uncharacteristically accurate handling for a vehicle of its size and price range. However, due to the use of multiple suspension pivot and attachment points (similar to the Corvette's suspension architecture), maintaining the suspension is more costly than some less technical suspension systems.

With the 1988 model year came a completely new front and rear suspension with vented disc brakes at all four corners- what Pontiac's engineers had planned for the car to have from the beginning. The front suspension geometry was changed to decrease the scrub radius thus decreasing steering effort without adding a bulky power steering system. The camber curve was also much improved, the dampers are moved inside the coil springs, and new sealed bearing/hub units were used in 1988. The rear suspension featured multi-link (two lateral links and one trailing arm) [[Chapman strut]] suspension, and the tie-rod related bump steer experienced with the earlier suspension design was fixed. The brakes were also upgraded to {{convert|10.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} vented rotors on the front and rear with an improved slide caliper design having larger diameter slides. The Fiero Formula (new for 1988) and Fiero GT models also received a rear anti-sway bar to compliment non-progressive rate springs.

The 1984<U+2013>1987 frames will accept a 1988 rear cradle. However, the struts must be replaced with a narrower diameter [[Carrera coil-over]] unit with a steel tube extension and offset mounting plates added to replace the Chapman strut unit. Thus yielding a larger, 1984<U+2013>1987 engine compartment with the ride-quality benefits of the 1988 suspension.

In the August 1985 issue of ''[[Road & Track]]'', the Fiero was tested against six other sports cars. The slalom results (MPH): [[Honda CRX|Honda Civic CRX Si]]: 62.5 [[Toyota MR2]]: 61.6
Pontiac Fiero: 61.5 [[Alfa Romeo Spider|Alfa Romeo Graduate]]: 58.4
[[Fiat X1/9|Bertone X1/9]]: 58.3 [[Mazda RX-7|Mazda RX-7 GSL]]: 57.2

====Four-speed manual====
All 4-speed [[manual transmission]]s were built at the [[Muncie, Indiana]] [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance 4-speed with a final drive ratio of 4.10, and an economy 4-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model and part of the 1986 production year came with a 4-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 4-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.

====Five-speed manual====
[[Isuzu]] and Muncie (Getrag)- 5-speed transmissions were available, depending on model and equipment beginning in 1985 for the Isuzu 5-speed which came on 4-cylinder cars and in 1986 for the Muncie 5-speed which came on V6 equipped cars. The [[Getrag 282]] 5-speed is sometimes referred to as the Muncie 282 or the Muncie Getrag 282, as the design was licensed to General Motors for manufacture by Muncie (Getrag never built the 282). This Muncie transmission is the stronger unit, designed for use with the higher output of the V6.

===Crash Safety===
The Pontiac Fiero, being popularly known as being "made entirely of fiberglass," is wrongly accused of being unsafe in a collision.

The Fiero, with its unique plastic body-on-spaceframe design, helped the Fiero achieve a NHTSA NCAP frontal crash test rating of 5 stars, the highest rating available.

According to Hemmings Motor News, the exceedingly sturdy, 600-pound space frame consisted of roughly 280 separate galvanized and high-strength steel stampings joined by 3,800 welds and, when assembled with the Fiero's mechanicals, was fully driveable without its skin.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hemmings.com |url=http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2009/08/01/hmn_feature21.html |title=Space Age Space Frame &#124; Hemmings Motor News |publisher=Hemmings.com |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref> The Fiero's body panels are purely cosmetic and carry no structural load. The Fiero was the second safest vehicle sold in America from 1984 to 1988, bested by the Volvo 740DL station wagon.

The official crash test scores were as follows:

**Head Injury Criterion - 356.5/308.6
**Chest Deceleration (G)-30.9/29.9
**Femur Load (LB)- Left 840/800 Right 800/740<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/database/aspx/searchmedia2.aspx?database=v&tstno=667&mediatype=r&r_tstno=667 |title=NHTSA VSR &#124; Search Media Page |publisher=Nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safecarguide.com/mak/pontiac/idx.htm |title=Pontiac Crash-Test Results, Pontiac Safety Information, Pontiac Insurance Data, NHTSA, NCAP, IIHS, Bonneville, Montana, Vibe, GTO, Firebird, Aztec, Fiero, LeMans, Trans Am, Grand Prix, Grand Am, Sunfire, Transport, Sunbird, 6000, 2000 |publisher=Safecarguide.com |date= |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref>

==Problems and issues==
===Engine fire reputation===
Of the total production of the Pontiac Fiero of 370,168,<ref name="spotters_guide"/> only 260 (0.07%)of them were reported to have had engine fires of some type, depending on the source used.

The engine fires almost exclusively pertained to the 1984 model year. Later model years were produced with upgraded equipment, and frequency of engine fire was significantly reduced.

The Associated Press quoted the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] as saying it had "...received 148 complaints regarding Pontiac Fieros catching fire including reports of six injuries.... Low levels of engine [[oil]] may cause a connecting rod to break, allowing oil to escape and come into contact with engine parts. The oil would catch fire when it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components.... David Hudgens, a GM spokesman in [[Detroit]]... said, 'If you ran out of [[oil]], and then that coupled with some aggressive driving, perhaps, and maybe not changing the [[oil]] very often, you end up with a broken rod, and that's where the connecting rod came in; it is still the owner's responsibility to check the oil.' "<ref name="fire_danger">{{cite news |title=U.S. Steps Up Probe of Alleged Fire Danger in Pontiac Fieros |agency=Associated Press |work=Fiero Owner newsletter |date=1st Qtr 1989}}</ref>

The [[Pontiac]] division claimed in a 1988 press release that "GM tests have shown that running these 1984 cars with low engine oil level can cause connecting rod failure which may lead to an engine compartment fire.... Pontiac is aware of 260 fires attributable to the condition, along with ten reported minor injuries."<ref name="pontiac_division">{{cite press release |publisher=Pontiac Division of GM |date=November 25, 1987 |title=Pontiac Division Release |accessdate=Spring 1988 |publishedin=Fiero News}}</ref>

The larger of the two reported numbers of cars with fires (260) amounts to 0.07% of Fiero models produced. The fires affected the 2.5&nbsp;L engine almost exclusively, and mostly 1984 models (although there may have been additional occurrences after the above reports were published).

There are several possible contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause is thought to be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's [[Saginaw]] plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5 quarts, but a misprint on the [[dipstick]] and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.

Alternatively, some fires may have been due to the engine wiring harness bulkhead connector (C500) being located in the center of the engine bay above the exhaust manifold, where the heat could possibly melt and ignite the wiring. The 1984 model had a magnesium grille over this area. In later models, the main engine harness connector (C500) was moved to the battery area, and was improved to some degree with better heat shielding wrapped around the wiring harness.

A third cause might be cracks in the engine block from over-tightening the head bolts. Some engines developed cracks in the block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or exhaust manifold at the front of the engine compartment.

Most vehicles existing today have been serviced by GM during one of the safety recalls on the car.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer [[AC Delco]] PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.

Any fires that happen today would most likely not be caused by the aforementioned causes, but instead due to faulty repairs and failure of engine components, wiring, etc. due to age.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Cooling system issues===
With an already hot normal [[operating temperature]] of {{convert|220|F}} prior to the recall switching to a {{convert|195|F}} thermostat, the mid-mounted engine utilized long pipes to carry coolant to the front-mounted radiator. This demanded that a special coolant filling procedure be followed to prevent severe overheating. Simply pouring coolant into the thermostat housing (on the engine) would leave an air bubble in the radiator, while adding coolant just to the radiator would leave an air bubble in the engine's coolant passages. Proper procedure (with engine idling and the thermostat removed, filling the thermostat housing, burping the bubble out of the radiator by cracking open the radiator cap until coolant exits) must be followed in order to ensure an air-free cooling system.

A second problem has become common as more Fieros are being serviced by shops unfamiliar with their design. The under-body coolant tubes are positioned in such a manner that a casual glance underneath the car will not suggest their fragility. As a result, many have been crushed by shop lifts, resulting in a near complete lack of engine cooling. The age of the car suggests that even GM dealerships may now be unaware of the proper jacking methods.

{{or section|date=February 2012}}
Currently the Fiero has a cult following of owners and customizers. While all Fiero models are considered to be collectible, the 1988 model year is especially sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades that can be done to improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the [[Quad-4]] engine to the [[Chevrolet small-block V8]] to the Cadillac 4.9&nbsp;L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4&nbsp;L found in the 1993, 1994, or 1995 Camaro/Firebird.  One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has even gone so far as to install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505&nbsp;horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9&nbsp;L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production.<ref name="speech">{{cite conference |last=Aldikacti |first=Hulki |date=July 2003 |title=Speech given to the Classic Fiero Owners Group, International (CFOGi) |booktitle=20th Anniversary of the Introduction of the Fiero Celebration
}}</ref> As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.

A large following of owners still exists with many web pages, groups, and clubs devoted to the car, and the basic chassis is commonly used as a kit-car platform from wild custom rebodies to [[Ferrari F355]] replicas. Due to their small size and weight, they are also a popular choice for all-electric conversions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Fiero has even had some media exposure, including an appearance in the TV Drama "Breaking Bad"  Season 3: Episode 6  - "Sunset"

===Models===
Fiero models and die-cast replicas have come and gone over the years. [[Hot Wheels]] released a 1984 Fiero 2M4 under many paint schemes. These Hot Wheels cars are now very rare. [[Matchbox (brand)|Matchbox]] and [[Majorette_(toy_manufacturer)|Majorette]] also released Fiero models during the car's heyday. [[Monogram_models|Monogram]] has released and re-released a 1985 Fiero GT model (the re-release is currently available). In recent years, a large 1:18 die-cast model of a 1985 GT has been released in red and silver. In 2007 the [[Motor Max]] toy company began releasing small die-cast Fiero GT toys under the 'American Graffiti' and 'Fresh Cherries' lines. Select [[Wal-Mart]] locations sold a special "Since '68" Fiero made by Hot Wheels, which uses the original 1984 mold with a new paint job.
