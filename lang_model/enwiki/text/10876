The '''River Eau''' is a 15 mile (24&nbsp;km) long tributary of the [[River Trent]] that flows through [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]].<ref name="OSmap" />

The Eau catchment lies between that of the Bottesford Beck to the north, and the [[River Witham]] to the south and east, and covers an area of 125 km2. The river is one of the few notable streams that drain the right bank of the tidal Trent.<ref name="OSmap">{{cite book|last=Ordnance Survey|title=Scuntorpe and Gainsborough|publisher=Ordnance Survey|year=2002|series=OS Landranger Map Series 112|isbn=0-319-22712-X}}</ref>

The source of the river is near [[Harpswell, Lincolnshire|Harpswell]], at the foot of the [[Lincoln Cliff|Lincolnshire Edge]], and it joins the tidal River Trent at Barlings, near [[Scotter]]. Unlike other rivers that drain into the tidal Trent, there is no pumping station associated with the outfall, it relies on gravity to discharge during periods of tidal [[low water]].<ref name="LCC">{{cite web|url=http://parishes.lincolnshire.gov.uk/Files/Parish/15/FloodProtectionReportSept09.pdf
|title=Scotter flood protection report |publisher=lincolnshire.gov.uk |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=20 February 2013}}</ref>

The Eau flows through the village of [[Scotter]], which has a history of being flooded by the river; the most recent occasion was in June 2007.<ref name="LCC" />

The river is also important for the drainage of the flat low lying agricultural land that surrounds it, with some 2000 hectares or 20 square kilometres of the Gainsborough [[Internal Drainage Board]] district, relying on the Eau for this function.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gainsborough IDB|url=http://www.gidb.co.uk|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> Whilst the drains that discharge into the Eau are maintained by the Drainage Board, the river is the responsibility of the [[Environment Agency]] being designated as a [[Main river]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=357683.0&y=355134.0&scale=1&layerGroups=default&ep=map&textonly=off&lang=_e&topic=floodmap#x=486932&y=398519&lg=1,&scale=7|title=Environment Agency What's in your Backyard |publisher=Environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2013-02-27}}</ref>

Its tributaries are called Northorpe Beck, Manton Sewer and Dar Beck.<ref name=25kmap>Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 Scale Colour Raster map</ref>
