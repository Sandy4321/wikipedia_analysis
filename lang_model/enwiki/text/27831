"'''Anytime You Need a Friend'''" is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]]. It was released on May 31, 1994 by [[Columbia Records]] as the fourth and final single from Carey's third [[studio album]], ''[[Music Box (album)|Music Box]]'' (1993). Written and produced by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], the song draws influence from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] genres. While the album focused heavily on pop oriented and radio friendly material, "Anytime You Need a Friend" deviated from the formula, finishing as the only gospel-infused song on ''Music Box''. Lyrically, the song's protagonist tells her love interest that anytime he may need a friend, she will be there unconditionally for him. Throughout the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] and climax, critics noted the lyrics altering from those of a friend, to those of a lover.

The song was well received by contemporary music critics, many of which felt Carey's large spanning vocal range on the song, as well as its gospel influence was missing on most of ''Music Box''. Aside from its critical acceptance, the song achieved strong worldwide charting, placing at number twelve on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], however becoming her first single to miss the top-ten. Additionally, it peaked at number five in Canada and topped the singles charts in Finland and the Netherlands. The song attained a top-twenty peak position in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Carey performed "Anytime You Need a Friend" live on several televised talk and award shows around the world, including ''[[The David Letterman Show]]'', the British music chart program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', German entertainment show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'', Australian breakfast program ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' and the 1993 Music Fair in Japan. Additionally, the song served as a closing number on Carey's [[Music Box Tour]] and [[Daydream World Tour]]s, was featured on Carey's compilation albums, ''[[Greatest Hits (Mariah Carey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Ballads (Mariah Carey album)|The Ballads]]'' (2008). Apart from the several remixes commissioned for the song, the C+C remix became the most notable, being produced by [[C+C Music Factory]]'s [[David Cole (producer)|David Cole]] and [[Robert Clivill<U+00E9>s]], and the first of Carey's remixes to feature her on production credits.

The song's music video was filmed by Danielle Federici, in New York, during the summer of 1994. The video is filmed in [[black-and-white]] fashion, and features Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with a straightened hairstyle for the first time in her career. Additionally, the music video showcases scenes of Carey singing by a large church choir in a foyer, as well as several people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, who are alone and depressed. As the video progresses, the child and man are befriended after brief interludes and prayers to God. The song's C+C remix also featured its own music video, showing behind the scenes footage of Carey and her background singers enjoying themselves during the original video's filming. 

== Background and recording ==
In 1989, Carey was discovered by [[Tommy Mottola]], CEO of [[Columbia Records]], and was promptly signed to the label. Carey's [[Mariah Carey (album)|self-titled]] debut [[studio album]], released the following year, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs she had already written in high school alongside fellow classmate, [[Ben Margulies]].<ref name="nickson">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=50}}</ref> Aside from the seven songs taken from Carey's demo tape, four other tracks were written and produced by the former and an array of famed record producers. The album was complimented by critics, who called it a mature debut, full of various genre influences ranging from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]].<ref name="nickson2">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=53}}</ref> The album became a commercial success, selling over fifteen million units globally.<ref name="bet">{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/entertainment/News/mariahtwenty.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished&Referrer=%7B1165D08F-7604-4004-92E0-04CCBC1FAAF0%7D|title=BET Exclusive: Mariah Celebrates 20 Years; Thanks Fans|work=''[[Black Entertainment Television]]''|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=2010-08-15}}</ref> While making a strong impact on pop music, Carey became interested in altering her sound, and deviating from pop music for her second studio effort, ''[[Emotions (album)|Emotions]]'' (1991).<ref name="nickson2"/> Following the success of her debut, Columbia allowed her to take more control over her musical departure, enabling her to change her genre influences and production. During the album's recording, Carey worked with several different musicians and producers, aside from [[Walter Afanasieff]], the only hold over from her debut.<ref name="nickson3">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=55}}</ref>

''Emotions'' contained influences from mostly 1950's, 60's and 70's balladry and [[gospel music]], as well as her continued work of R&B and soul. The album, while praised by some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, selling far less and failing to introduce Carey into a different market.<ref name="nickson4">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=57}}</ref> Following these events, Columbia decided to try and market Carey in a similar fashion to that of her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop record.<ref name="nickson5">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=80}}</ref> Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, ''[[Music Box (album)|Music Box]]'' (1993).

"Anytime you Need a Friend" is a [[Tempo|mid-tempo]] song which borrows influence from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]] musical genres. According to the music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is written in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[C major]], while the beat is set in the signature of [[Time signature|common time]], which moves at a moderate pace of 83 [[Tempo|beats per minute]].<ref name="Sheet Music">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0055835|title=Mariah Carey <U+2013> Anytime You Need a Friend Sheet Music (Digital Download)|work=''Musicnotes.com''|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing|Alfred Publishing Company]]|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> It has a sequence of Fm<sub>7</sub><U+2013>Gm<sub>7</sub><U+2013>Fm<sub>7</sub><U+2013>Gm<sub>7</sub> as its [[chord progression]].<ref name="Sheet Music"/> Carey's vocals in the song span over three octaves, from the low note of an E<sub>3</sub> to the high note of a E<sub>5</sub>. The song was written by Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]], with production helmed by the pair as well. After the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], a church [[choir]] is featured throughout its final chorus and climax. Carey's vocals are layered over the background gospel-styled vocals on the final chorus, after which she uses the [[whistle register]] to close the song. The song's lyrics describe a relationship the protagonist has with another individual, telling them that anytime they need a friend, she will be there unconditionally. 

Throughout the song, the lyrics seemingly show the evolving relationship between the couple.<ref name="nickson10">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=109}}</ref> Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present.<ref name="nickson10"/> Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you just believe in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go.<ref name="nickson10"/> The protagonist is willing to accept the relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget, or "let go."<ref name="nickson10"/>

== Critical reception ==
"Anytime You Need a Friend" was generally well-received by contemporary music critics, many of whom praised the song's gospel influence as well as Carey's [[vocal range]]. Following the mixed reception to the song's parent album, ''Music Box'', "Anytime You Need a Friend" was deemed as a strong contrast to the album's pop influence. Critics agreed that through lowering Carey's vocal bombast, the album suffered due to lowered passion and energy levels. The song however, was considered the only standout from the album, altering heavily from the pop oriented formula of ''Music Box''. J.D. Considine from ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' wrote "Where another singer might have been tempted to turn "Anytime You Need a Friend" into a full-blown sanctified sing-out, Carey and producer Walter Afanasieff use the gospel harmonies on the chorus as contrast for Carey's pop soul vocal."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-08-31/features/1993243208_1_music-box-melody-dreamlover/2|title=A 'Music Box' Full Of Melody|last=Considine|first=J.D.|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|publisher=Tribune Company|date=1993-09-01|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> A writer from ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'' called the song one of Carey's "original classics," and felt it earned a place on her compilation album ''[[Number 1's (Mariah Carey album)|Number 1's]]'', even though it did not top the [[Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ME&p_theme=me&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAE9CC3ABB50CE6&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Lucky 13: Carey Complies No. 1 Hits In Tribute To Fans|work=[[Portland Press Herald]]|publisher=MaineToday Media, Inc.|date=1998-12-06|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> In an article from the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'', a writer commented that Carey's vocal range in the song sounds as if its from a "glass-shattering dimension" and complimented her incorporation of the gospel genre and church choir into the song's climax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&s_site=dfw&p_multi=ST&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF8F4863196072&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Mariah Carey's Voice Is The True Revelation|work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=1993-11-04|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> Christopher John Farley from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the song as "gospel flavored" and wrote "'Anytime You Need a Friend' demonstrates Carey's vocal power, although too fleetingly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979158,00.html|title=Hurray! a B Minus|last=Farley|first=Christopher John|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]].

== Music videos ==
[[Image:Mariah AnytimeYouNeed.jpg|thumb|right|300px|In the still, Carey is seen singing with her hands in the sky. Behind her stand the choir, perched on the large stairwell. Critics noted the inclusions of God and religion in the video, during moments such as this when prayer to God is imminent.]]
The single's music video, directed by Danielle Federici, was filmed during the early summer of 1994. It was filmed in [[Black-and-white|black-and-white]], and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely and in need of a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who it sitting on a withered stoop. 

Consecutively, during the song's bridge, Carey watches as the small child's mother carries her to a nearby playground where her friends are frolicking and playing. Similarly, the elderly man is met with some other elderly citizens, who accompany him to another building nearby. During the song's climax, Carey joins the choir, flailing her hands wildly towards the sky, and smiling and gazing into the cloudy morning. Renee Graham from ''The Boston Globe'' gave the video two out of four stars. She complimented on the fact that the video captured the song's lyrical essence and how it managed to portray it in a clear and concise way. Although calling it "simple," Graham commented that "Videos have never really been Mariah Carey's thing, and frankly, they've never had to be. Carey has a killer voice, so the last thing she'd want to do is overshadow her singing with a lot of choreography, complicated story lines or explosions."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61977213.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+24%2C+1994&author=Renee+Graham&pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=A+voice%2C+not+a+video+diva&pqatl=google|title=A Voice Not A Video Diva|last=Graham|first=Renee|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=1994-06-24|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> Author Chris Nickson compared several parts of the video to religion and belief in God.

Additionally, he claimed it was more evident with each passing scene of the video, as each of the lonely people in the video gaze up into the skies, possibly praying or searching for an answer to their lonliness. A video was commissioned for the C+C club mix of the song. Known as the C+C video edit, it was also directed by Danielle Federici and serves as a behind the scenes addendum to the main music video.<ref name=allm/> It is filmed in black and white, and is composed of clips of Carey and her friends during filming of the video, where they chat, laugh and enjoy time with each other. Carey's husband at the time [[Tommy Mottola]] made a cameo appearance in the video, appearing alongside Carey during the second verse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FF45DF830032546&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=CD Reviews: Mariah Carey - The Remixes|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Journal Communications]]|date=2003-11-13|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref>

== Live performances ==
Carey promoted "Anytime You Need a Friend" through several live televised performances throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. Carey first performed the song during a live appearance on ''[[the David Letterman Show]]'', which was followed by an interview regarding the album.<ref name="argenson"/> Carey appeared on the program wearing a black blouse and matching short skirt. For the song, several male and female background vocalists took stage behind Carey, all sharing five appointed microphones. Promotion through Europe included a visit and performance on the British music chart program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', German entertainment show ''[[Wetten, dass..?]]'', ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' in Australia, and the 1993 Japanese Music Fair.<ref name="argenson"/> Additionally, Carey's performance of the song at an intimate concert at [[Proctor's Theatre (Schenectady, New York)|Proctor's Theatre]] on July 15, 1993 was filmed and released as the [[VHS]] ''[[Here Is Mariah Carey]]''.<ref name="argenson2"/> Aside from the several televised appearances, Carey performed the song throughout her [[Music Box Tour]] (1993) and [[Daydream World Tour]] (1996). During the shows in 1993, Carey featured the song as the fifteenth song on the set-list, and was performed in a similar fashion as on her televised appearances.<ref name="argenson">{{harvnb|Argenson|2008|p=20}}</ref> 

Prior to beginning the song, Carey urged the crowd to "never be lonely" and "always try and find that special person in your life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-18/news/9311180027_1_songs-minnie-riperton-hero|title=Yes, She Can Sing: Carey's Voice Is Not A Studio Creation|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=1993-11-18|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> Following the show in Chicago, ''Chicago Tribune'' critic Greg Kot felt that her performance of the song truly "demonstrated that her multi-octave voice is no studio fabrication."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-18/news/9311180027_1_songs-minnie-riperton-hero|title=Yes, She Can Sing: Carey's Voice Is Not A Studio Creation|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=1993-11-18|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24191515.html?dids=24191515:24191515&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+18%2C+1993&author=Greg+Kot%2C+Tribune+Rock+Critic.&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=YES%2C+SHE+CAN+SING+CAREY'S+VOICE+NO+STUDIO+CREATION&pqatl=google|title=Yes, She Can Sing; Carey's Voice Is No Studio Creation|last=Kot|first=Greg|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=1993-11-18|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref>
During her shows at the [[Tokyo Dome]] during 1996, Carey sported a long and straightened hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown.<ref name="argenson2">{{harvnb|Argenson|2008|p=27}}</ref> She sang the original version of the song, up until half way through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs.<ref name="argenson2"/> However, once the remix began, six male dancers made their way to the right and let sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered.<ref name="argenson2"/> Aside from the usual florescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle.<ref name="argenson2"/> She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.<ref name="argenson2"/>
