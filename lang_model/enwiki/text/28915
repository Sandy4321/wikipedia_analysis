Tebow played quarterback for [[Allen D.

== Early life ==
[[Image:Tebow army all american.jpg|thumb|left|Tebow at the 2006 [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]] as a high school senior.]]
Tebow was born on [[August 14]] [[1987]] in the [[Philippines]] to Bob and Pam Tebow  who were serving as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[missionary|missionaries]]. Both Pam and Bob are University of Florida graduates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio|publisher=''Tim Tebow Zone''| url=http://www.tebowzone.com/about/|accessdate=2008-01-12}}</ref>  Pam suffered infection with a pathogenic [[amoeba]] while pregnant with him, and an [[abortion]] was recommended by her doctors.<ref>The 2007 Heisman Trophy presentation ceremony</ref>
  
All of the Tebow children were [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] by their mother, who worked to instill the family<U+2019>s deep Christian beliefs along the way.<ref>[http://www.btea.org/aboutus.asp The Tebow Family]</ref> In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing homeschooled students to compete in local high school sporting events. The law specifies that homeschool students may participate on the team of the local school in the county and school district in which they live.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodbread|first=Chase|title=She Fought the Law and Tebow Won|publisher=''[[The Florida Times-Union]]''| url=http://www.flhef.org/newsflashes/tebow.html|date=[[1 January]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>  The Tebows lived in Ponte Vedra and Tim played linebacker and tight end for Trinity Christian Academy for one season, but his dream was to play quarterback. Trinity did not pass the ball much, so he began to explore his options with a new high school.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/2006-11-21-transfers-cover_x.htm Tebow shopped for  new high school]</ref> One of Tebow's options was Nease High School, who liked to throw the ball, and Head Coach Craig Howard was known for his passing offense.  With the rest of his family living on a farm, Tim began playing quarterback for Nease High School in [[Ponte Vedra Beach]].  His performance soon began to turn some heads which even led to a minor controversy over him being a homeschooled student.<ref name="tbo_sports">{{cite news |title=A Cut Above |last=Johnston |first=Joey| publisher=''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'' | url=http://gators.tbo.com/gators/MGBQVFCAMHE.html|date=[[25 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>

As a junior, Tebow<U+2019>s stock rose as he became a high profile, highly [[recruiting (athletics)|recruited]] major college quarterback prospect.  The 6<U+2019>3<U+201D>, 225 lb (1.91 m, 102 kg) quarterback continued to impress during his senior season, leading the Nease Panthers to a state title, earning All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a [[Parade Magazine|Parade]] All-American.<ref>[http://all-americans.parade.com/2006_football/story.html 2006 Parade All-Americans]</ref> Tebow finished his high school career with 9,810 passing yards, 3,186 rushing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing touchdowns. He played in the [[U.S. Army]] All-American Bowl Game in [[San Antonio, Texas]] which features the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and is shown nationally on NBC television.<ref>[http://rivals100.rivals.com/content.asp?SID=880&CID=497018 Tebow practices in Amy All-American Bowl]</ref>

Despite having parental and sibling ties to the University of Florida, he remained open-minded during the recruiting process and became very close to [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] coach [[Mike Shula]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Alabama Gets Close-Up Look at Florida's Tebow|last=Long |first=Mark| publisher=''[[The Ledger]]'' | url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060928/NEWS/609280452/|date=[[28 September]] [[2006]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>  After careful consideration he decided to play for the team he felt best suited his skills and style of play, which was [[Urban Meyer]]'s [[Florida Gators]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Tebow commits to Florida |last=Gola |first=Henry| publisher=''[[ESPN]]'' |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/ncaa/recruiting/news/story?id=2257886 |date=[[13 December]] [[2005]]|accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> He chose Florida because they employed a similar <U+201C>[[spread offense|spread option]]<U+201D> offense that he excelled in at Nease High School.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

Tebow was considered one of the nation<U+2019>s top recruits and was the subject of an [[ESPN]] <U+201C>Faces in Sports<U+201D> documentary.  The segment was titled "Tim Tebow: The Chosen One", and focused on Tim<U+2019>s homeschool controversy and missionary work in the Philippines, as well as his exploits on the field of play and the college recruiting process.<ref>[http://alabama.scout.com/2/477962.html Tim Tebow:The Chosen One]</ref> Tim Tebow was also featured in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on the <U+201C>Faces in the Crowd<U+201D> page.<ref>[http://www.staugustine.com/stories/122104/spo_2770650.shtml Tebow in SI's Faces in the Crowd]</ref> In 2007 he was named to [[FHSAA's All-Century Team]] that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100 year history of high school football.<ref>[http://www.fhsaa.org/news/2007/1212.htm FHSAA Announces All-Century Team]</ref>

Prior to the 2006 season, Tebow was listed by ''Sports Illustrated'' as college football's future top mobile quarterback.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/luke_winn/08/22/mobileQB.partthree/index.html |title=The next generation: Plenty of young mobile QBs ready to showcase talent |last-Winn |first=Luke |publisher=''[[Sports Illustrated]]''/[[CNN]] |date=[[22 August]] [[2006]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>   

Tebow made his college debut coming off the bench behind [[Chris Leak]] in a [[goal line (American football)|goal line]] situation against [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles|Southern Miss]]. He rushed for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble on his first play.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores106/106245/NCAAF701468.htm Southern Miss vs. Florida USA Today]</ref> In his next game, he led the team in rushing yards against [[UCF Golden Knights football|UCF]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=262520057 Florida Gators vs UCF Knights ESPN]</ref>

He made his SEC debut against the [[2006 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] on [[September 16]]. His performance included a ten-yard run on his first carry and converting a critical fourth down near the end of the game, which led to the Gators' go-ahead touchdown.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200609160071 Florida-Tennessee game recap]</ref>   

Tebow's biggest game in the season came against the [[2006 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] on [[October 7]], where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another. Tebow had a one-yard run on the goal line for his first score, a one-yard "jump pass" to tight end Tate Casey, in which he jumped in the air and double-pumped his arm before releasing the ball, and a 35-yard play-action pass to [[wide receiver]] Louis Murphy.<ref>http://www.firstcoastnews.com/sports/gators/news-article.aspx?storyid=66505</ref>  

Tebow played a role in the Gators' victory in the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]] against [[2006 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]].

Tebow was named as one of the "Breakout Players of 2007" for college football by ''[[Sporting News]]'', and was named the starter at quarterback for the Florida Gators before the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=162465 |title=Year in Preview: Made men |publisher=''[[The Sporting News]]'' |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref> The Gators' offense in 2007 was expected to be similar to what Urban Meyer used at [[Utah Utes|Utah]], since Meyer views Tebow as <U+201C>very similar to [[Alex Smith]].<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=2765329 |title=Tebow's growth as a passer key for Gators |last=Schlabach|first=Mark |date=[[14 February]] [[2007]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref> Smith was quarterback for Meyer's last team at Utah in 2004, which became the first team from outside the [[BCS conference]]s to play in and win a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl game, and went on to be the top overall pick in the [[2005 NFL Draft]].   

There were some questions about how he would perform as a full time passer,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=272440057&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines |title=Florida's Tebow throws for 300 yards, 3 TDs in debut as starter |date=[[02 September]] [[2007]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref> but he opened the year 13-of-17 for 300 yards and 3 touchdowns in his starting debut against [[Western Kentucky University]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/02/ap/sportsline/main3227782.shtml Tebow Shines As Gators Crush W.

Additionally, he rushed 194 times for 838 yards and 22 touchdowns on the ground through 11 games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/d1mfb/natlRank.jsp?year=2007&div=4&rpt=IA_playerpasseff |title=Bowl Subdivision (FBS) National Player Report: Passing Efficiency |publisher=[[NCAA]] |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>  Tebow's 51 touchdowns were more than 87 Division 1-A Teams scored.{{Fact|date=February 2008}}

In week 4 of the season, when the Gators faced Ole Miss in an SEC match-up, Tebow broke the school record for rushing yards by a quarterback in one game, with 166 yards.<ref>[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?sport=footb&id=12642&html=0 Tebow has big day against Ole Miss]</ref> On November 3, against Vanderbilt, Tebow rushed for two touchdowns to break the all-time SEC quarterback TD record in a single season.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=273070057 Tebow breaks record against Vanderbilt]</ref> Against LSU, leading by 10 in the 4th quarter, Tebow was largely ineffective and had a turnover as he was unable to lead his team to any score, and LSU came back to win the game. LSU went on to win the 2007 National Championship. 

In a game versus the [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] on November 10, Tebow broke the school record for rushing touchdowns in a season and set a career high with 5 rushing touchdowns. This brought his season total to 19 rushing touchdowns, which tied him for the SEC record for any player in a season (shared with [[Shaun Alexander]], [[Garrison Hearst]], and [[LaBrandon Toefield]]). He also broke [[Danny Wuerffel]]'s conference record for touchdowns accounted for in a single season with 42.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071111/SPORTS/711110354/1002/SPORTS |title=Florida Gators' Tebow terrorizes South Carolina |publisher=[[Florida Today]] |accessdate=2007-11-11}}</ref>

On November 17, Tebow had a record day against [[Florida Atlantic University|Florida Atlantic]], he scored his 20th rushing touchdown to set a new conference record for most rushing touchdowns in a season. He also became the only person ever in NCAA History to score 20 touchdowns rushing and 20 touchdowns passing in the same season.<ref name="Twenty"/>

On November 24, against the [[Florida State Seminoles]], Tebow threw for three touchdowns and rushed for two in a 45-12 rout of the Seminoles. It was later revealed that Tebow [[bone fracture|fractured]] his right hand during the third quarter but played the rest of the game. He had to wear a cast for the next three weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/ncaa/specials/bowls/2007/12/14/tebow.cast.ap/ |title=Tebow practices without cast |date=[[14 December]] [[2007]] |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

After the season was over, Tebow became a favorite for the Heisman Trophy, given to the most outstanding college football player of the year, which he won on December 8 in New York City.

While the Gators finished the season in [[Orlando, Florida]] with a 41-35 loss to Michigan in the [[2008 Capital One Bowl]], Tebow maintained his record for both rushing and passing for at least one touchdown in every game played, and he raised the record for total touchdowns accounted for in a single season to 55.<ref>[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=13153&sport=footb&html=0 Capital One Bowl, Gatorzone]</ref> He played with a soft cast on the hand he broke in his previous game.

==Effect on homeschooling movement==
On January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an [[ESPN]] <U+201C>Outside The Lines<U+201D> feature on homeschooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states.   Because a homeschooler's access to public and private school athletic functions vary by state, Tebow and [[Miami Dolphins]] defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] (who was allowed to play at his local high school in [[Pennsylvania]]) argue in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6Yg8Bwa3EY |title=ESPN Outside the Lines - January 7, 2007 |publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

Upon becoming the first homeschooled athlete to win the Heisman trophy, Tebow remarked, "That<U+2019>s really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of homeschoolers as not very athletic <U+2013> it's like, go win a [[spelling bee]] or something like that <U+2013> it<U+2019>s an honor for me to be the first one to do that." <ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usadaily.com/article.cfm?articleID=188229 |title=Homeschooler Snaps Up Heisman Nomination |last=Lyman|first=Isabel |date=[[06 December]] [[2007]] |publisher=''USA Daily'' |accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref>

Tebow's popularity inspired equal access supporters in [[Alabama]] to name their bill in the [[Alabama Legislature]] "The Tim Tebow Bill".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timtebowbill.com |title=The State of Alabama's "Tim Tebow Bill" |accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>   The bill, which is pending in the Alabama Legislature, will allow Alabama home school athletes to play for their local high school teams just as Tebow did in Florida.
