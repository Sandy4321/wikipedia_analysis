'''Whale song''' is the [[sound]] made by [[whale]]s to [[animal communication|communicate]].

The word "[[song]]" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the [[Humpback Whale]]. This is included with or in comparison with [[music]], and male humpback whales have been described as "inveterate [[composers]]" of songs that are "'strikingly similar' to human musical traditions".<ref>Payne Roger, quoted in: Author(s): Susan Milius. "Music without Borders", p.253. Source: ''Science News'', Vol. 157, No. 16, (15 April, 2000), pp. 252-254. Published by: Society for Science &amp; the Public.</ref>

The mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of [[cetaceans]] to another. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. [[Visual perception|Sight]] is less effective for marine mammals because of the way water absorbs [[light]]. [[Olfaction|Smell]] also is limited, as molecules diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. In addition, the [[speed of sound]] in water is roughly four times that in the atmosphere at [[sea level]]. Because sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and [[cetology|cetologists]] are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased ambient noise in the world's oceans caused by ships and marine seismic surveys.

==Production of sound==
Humans produce sound by expelling air through the [[larynx]]. The [[vocal cords]] within the larynx open and close as necessary to separate the stream of air into discrete pockets of air.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} These pockets are shaped by the [[throat]], [[tongue]], and [[lip]]s into the desired sound, allowing humans to [[human voice|speak]].

Cetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans:&nbsp;the&nbsp;''Odontoceti''&nbsp;([[toothed whales]]<U+2014>including dolphins) and the ''Mysticeti'' ([[baleen whale]]s<U+2014>including the largest whales, such as the [[Blue Whale]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Odontocete whale sound production===
[[Image:Delphinschaedel.svg|300px|thumb|alt=Outline of what's inside a dolphin head. The skull is to the rear of the head, with the jaw bones extending narrowly forward to the nose. The anterior bursa occupies most of the upper front of the head, ahead of the skull and above the jaw. A network of air passages run from the upper roof of the mouth, past the back of the anterior bursa, to the blowhole. The posterior bursa is a small region behind the air passages, opposite the anterior bursa. Small phonic tips connect the bursa regions to the air passages.|Idealized dolphin head showing the regions involved in sound production. This image was redrawn from Cranford (2000).]]
Toothed whales do not make the long, low-frequency sounds known as the whale song.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Instead, they produce rapid bursts of high-frequency clicks and whistles. Single clicks are generally used for [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] whereas collections of clicks and whistles are used for communication.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Though a large pod of dolphins will make a veritable cacophony of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound. Frankel quotes one researcher who says listening to a school of odontocetes is like listening to a group of children at a school playground.<ref name=Frankel>''Sound production'', by Adam S. Frankel, in the ''Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals'' (pp 1126<U+2013>1137) ISBN 0-12-551340-2 (1998).</ref>

The multiple sounds odontocetes make are produced by passing air through a structure in the head called the phonic lips.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This structure functions like the human nasal cavity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As the air passes through this narrow passage, the phonic lip membranes are sucked together, causing the surrounding tissue to vibrate. These vibrations can, as with the vibrations in the human larynx, be consciously controlled with great sensitivity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The vibrations pass through the tissue of the head to the [[melon (whale)|melon]], which shapes and directs the sound into a beam of sound useful in echolocation. Every toothed whale except the [[sperm whale]] has two sets of phonic lips and is thus capable of making two sounds independently.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Once the air has passed the phonic lips it enters the [[vestibular system|vestibular sac]]. From there, the air may be recycled back into the lower part of the nasal complex, ready to be used for sound creation again, or passed out through the blowhole.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The [[French language|French]] name for phonic lips<U+2014>''museau de singe''<U+2014>translates to "monkey lips," which the phonic lip structure is supposed to resemble.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} New{{When|date=July 2009}} cranial analysis using [[computed axial tomography|computed axial]] and [[single photon emission computed tomography]] scans in 2004 showed, at least in the case of bottlenose dolphins, that air might be supplied to the nasal complex from the lungs by the [[palatopharyngeal sphincter]], enabling the sound creation process to continue for as long as the dolphin is able to hold its breath.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Houser, Dorian S. | coauthors = Finneran, James, Carder, Don, Van Bonn, William, Smith, Cynthia, Hoh, Carl, Mattrey, Robert and Ridgway, Sam | year = 2004 | title = Structural and functional imaging of bottlenose dolphin (''Tursiops truncatus'') cranial anatomy | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 207 | pages = 3657<U+2013>3665 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.01207 | pmid = 15371474}}</ref>

===Mysticete whale sound production===
Baleen whales, formally called mysticetes, do not have phonic lip structure. Instead, they have a larynx that appears to play a role in sound production, but it lacks vocal cords and scientists remain uncertain as to the exact mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The process, however, cannot be completely analogous to humans because whales do not have to exhale in order to produce sound. It is likely that they recycle air around the body for this purpose. Cranial sinuses may also be used to create the sounds, but again researchers are currently unclear how.

===Mysticete whale sound levels===
The frequency of baleen whale sounds ranges from 10 Hz to 31 kHz.<ref name=RGMT/> A list of typical levels is shown in the table below.

==Purpose of whale-created sounds==
While the complex and haunting sounds of the Humpback whale (and some blue whales) are believed to be primarily used in [[sexual selection]], the simpler sounds of other whales have a year-round use.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} While many{{Weasel-inline|date=July 2009}} toothed whales are capable of using echolocation to detect the size and nature of objects, this capability has never been demonstrated in baleen whales.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Further, unlike some fish such as [[shark]]s, a whale's sense of smell is not highly developed. Thus, given the poor visibility of aquatic environments and the fact that sound travels so well in water, sounds audible to humans may play a role in navigation. For instance, the depth of water or the existence of a large obstruction ahead may be detected by loud noises made by baleen whales.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The singing of whale songs for [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] enjoyment, personal satisfaction, or 'for art's sake', is "an untestable question in scientific terms."<ref>Entomologist Thomas Eisner, quoted in: Milius (2000), p.254.</ref>

==Song of the Humpback Whale==
[[File:Akhumps 128 016 0 500c.gif|thumb|255px|alt=Two spectral images with X axis being time. In one, the Y axis is frequency and there is a complicated pattern in the 10<U+2013>450 Hz region. In the other, the Y axis is amplitude, which is largely constant but with many small spikes.|Humpback whale, sound spectrum]]
Two groups of whales, the Humpback Whale and the subspecies of Blue Whale found in the [[Indian Ocean]], are known to produce a series of repetitious sounds at varying frequencies. This is known as whale song. Marine biologist Philip Clapham describes the song as "probably the most complex in the animal kingdom".<ref>{{cite book | title = Humpback whales | author = Clapham, Philip | publisher = Colin Baxter Photography | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-948661-87-9}}</ref>

Male humpback whales perform these vocalizations only during the mating season, and so it is believed the purpose of songs is to aid sexual selection.<ref name=Frankel/> Whether the songs are a competitive behavior between males seeking the same mate, a means of defining territory or a "flirting" behavior from a male to a female is not known and the subject of ongoing research.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Males have been observed singing while simultaneously acting as an "escort" whale in the immediate vicinity of a female. Singing has also been recorded in competitive groups of whales that are composed of one female and multiple males.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Interest in whale song was aroused by researchers [[Roger Payne]] and [[Scott McVay]] after the songs were brought to their attention by a Bermudian named Frank Watlington who was working for the US government at the SOFAR station listening for Russian submarines with underwater hydrophones off the coast of the island.<ref>{{cite book | title = Thousand mile song | author = Rothenberg, David | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0465071289}}</ref>

The songs follow a distinct hierarchical structure. The base units of the song (sometimes loosely called the "[[note (music)|notes]]") are  single uninterrupted emissions of sound that last up to a few seconds. These sounds vary in frequency from 20 Hz to 10 kHz (the typical human range of hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz). The units may be [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] (i.e., the pitch of the sound may go up, down, or stay the same during the note) or [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (get louder or quieter). However the adjustment of bandwidth on a spectrogram representation of the song reveals the essentially [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulsed]] nature of the FM sounds.

A collection of four or six units is known as a sub-[[phrase]], lasting perhaps ten seconds (see also [[phrase (music)]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A collection of two sub-phrases is a phrase. A whale will typically repeat the same phrase over and over for two to four minutes. This is known as a theme. A collection of themes is known as a song.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The whale will repeat the same song, which last up to 30 or so minutes, over and over again over the course of hours or even days.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This "[[Russian doll]]" hierarchy of sounds has captured the imagination of scientists.{{Weasel-inline|date=July 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

All the whales in an area sing virtually the same song at any point in time and the song is constantly and slowly evolving over time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} For example, over the course of a month a particular unit that started as an "upsweep" (increasing in frequency) might slowly flatten to become a constant note.<ref name=Frankel/> Another unit may get steadily louder. The pace of evolution of a whale's song also changes<U+2014>some years the song may change quite rapidly, whereas in other years little variation may be recorded.<ref name=Frankel/>

"Theme (2 mins)" has 4 ticks. "Phrase (15<U+2013>20 secs)" has 18 ticks. "Sub-phrase (7 secs)" has 36 ticks. "Unit (1 sec)" has many more ticks, this time angled up or down; it also has many gaps in the line.|Idealized schematic of the song of a humpback whale.<br/>Redrawn from Payne, et al. (1983)]]
Whales occupying the same geographical areas (which can be as large as entire ocean basins) tend to sing similar songs, with only slight variations. Whales from non-overlapping regions sing entirely different songs.<ref name=Frankel/>

As the song evolves, it appears that old patterns are not revisited.<ref name=Frankel/> An analysis of 19 years of whale songs found that while general patterns in song could be spotted, the same combination never recurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Humpback whales may also make stand-alone sounds that do not form part of a song, particularly during courtship rituals.<ref name=JMamm>{{cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1381574|title=Humpback Whale Songs on a North Atlantic Feeding Ground|author=Mattila, David. K|coauthors=Guinee, Linda N., Mayo, Charles A.|publisher=American Society of Mammalogists|date=1987|volume=68|issue=4|pp=880-883}}</ref> Finally, humpbacks make a third class of sound called the feeding call.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} This is a long sound (5 to 10 s duration) of near constant frequency. Humpbacks generally feed cooperatively by gathering in groups, swimming underneath shoals of fish and all lunging up vertically through the fish and out of the water together. Prior to these lunges, whales make their feeding call. The exact purpose of the call is not known, but research suggests that fish know what it means.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} When the sound was played back to them, a group of herring responded to the sound by moving away from the call, even though no whale was present.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Some scientists have proposed that Humpback Whale songs may serve an [[animal echolocation|echolocative]] purpose,<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mercado, E. III, and Frazer, L.N. | year = 2001 | title = Humpback whale song or humpback whale sonar?

==Other whale sounds==
Most baleen whales make sounds at about 15<U+2013>20 [[hertz]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} However, [[Marine biology|marine biologists]], led by Mary Ann Daher, at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] reported in ''[[New Scientist]]'' in December 2004 that she had been tracking a whale in the North Pacific for 12 years that was "singing" at 52 Hz.<ref name=NewSci>{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18424774.600-lonely-whales-song-remains-a-mystery.html|date=11 December 2004|accessdate=12 July 2009|title=Lonely whale's song remains a mystery|publisher=[[Reed Business Information Ltd]]|work=[[New Scientist]]}}</ref> The scientists are unable to explain this dramatic difference from the norm; however, they believe the whale is baleen<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_13-12-2004_pg6_14|title=Strange-voiced whale at large in the ocean|author=Associated Press|date=13 December 2004|accessdate=12 July 2009|publisher=''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]''}}</ref> and unlikely to be a new species,<ref name=NewSci/> suggesting that currently known species may have a wider vocal range than previously thought.

Most other whales and dolphins produce sounds of varying degrees of complexity. Of particular interest is the [[Beluga (whale)|Beluga]] (the "sea canary") which produces an immense variety of whistles, clicks and pulses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Human interaction==
[[Image:GPN-2000-001976.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Flat circular disc of gold, with a central label, a hole, and a wide band of very small lines, like a golden version of an old analog record|[[Voyager Golden Record]]s carried whale songs into [[outer space]] with other sounds representing planet Earth.]]
Though some observers suggest that undue fascination has been placed on the whales' songs simply because the animals are under the sea,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} most marine mammal scientists believe that sound plays a particularly vital role in the development and well-being of cetaceans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} It may be argued those against [[whaling]] have [[anthropomorphize]]d the behavior in an attempt to bolster their case,{{Weasel-inline|date=July 2009}}{{Who|date=July 2009}} noting for example that little account is taken of the "moo" of [[cattle]]. Conversely, pro-whaling nations are perhaps disposed to downplay the meaning of the sounds given the surrounding commercial and cultural interests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Researchers use [[hydrophone]]s (often adapted from their original military use in tracking submarines) to ascertain the exact location of the origin of whale noises.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Their methods allow them also to detect how far through an ocean a sound travels. Research by Dr. Christopher Clark of [[Cornell University]] conducted using military data showed that whale noises travel for thousands of kilometers.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4297531.stm|author=Bentley, Molly|date=28 February 2005|accessdate=12 July 2009}}</ref> As well as providing information about song production, the data allows researchers to follow the migratory path of whales throughout the "singing" (mating) season. One important finding is that whales in a process called the [[Lombard effect]] adjust their song to compensate for background [[noise pollution]].<ref name=" Scheifele">Scheifele PM, Andrew S, Cooper RA, Darre M, Musiek FE, Max L. (2005). St. Lawrence River beluga Indication of a Lombard vocal response in the St. Lawrence River Beluga.  J Acoust Soc Am. 117(3 Pt 1):1486<U+2013>92. {{PMID|15807036 }}</ref>

Prior to the introduction of human noise production, Clark says the noises may have traveled right from one side of an ocean to the other, agreeing with a thiry-year-old concept blaming large-scale shipping.<ref name=BBC/> His research indicates that ambient noise from boats is doubling with each decade.<ref name=BBC/> This has the effect of reducing the range at which whale noises can be heard. Clark admitted to being particularly concerned by this increase in ambient noise. [[Environmentalist]]s fear that such boat activity is putting undue stress on the animals as well as making it difficult to find a mate.<ref name=BBC/>
