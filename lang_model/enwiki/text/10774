National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map], accessed April 1, 2011</ref> There are 9 dams along the river's length.<ref>[http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/benviron/compinsp/pdf/damrep01.pdf Governor's Task Force on Dam Safety and Maintenance &ndash; Final Report, January 2001]</ref>

==Course==
The river is formed by the confluence of the [[Ponaganset River|Ponaganset]] and [[Moswansicut River|Moswansicut]] rivers in the area that is now flooded by the [[Scituate Reservoir]], the primary drinking water supply for the city of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and surrounding towns. From the reservoir, it flows southeast through the historic textile mill villages of [[Hope, Rhode Island|Hope]], Arkright, Harris, [[Phenix, Rhode Island|Phenix]], Lippitt and then into River Point, [[West Warwick, Rhode Island|West Warwick]] where it converges with the [[South Branch Pawtuxet River]] to form the main branch of the [[Pawtuxet River]].
