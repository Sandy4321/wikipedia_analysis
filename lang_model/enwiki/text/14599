At age 19, she married Dr Moses Suzman (died 1994), who was considerably older; they had two daughters. She returned to university as a lecturer in 1944. She gave up teaching for politics, being elected to the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]] in 1953 as a member of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]]. 

She switched to the [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] in 1959, and represented the [[Houghton Estate, Gauteng|Houghton]] constituency as that party's sole [[Member of Parliament|Member]] of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]], and the sole parliamentarian unequivocally opposed to apartheid, from 1961 to 1974.<ref>In No Uncertain Terms, Memoirs Helen Suzman Jonathan Ball Publishers</ref> She was often harassed by the police and her phone was tapped by them. She had a special technique for dealing with [[eavesdropping]], which was to blow a whistle into the mouthpiece of the phone.<ref name=NYTimesObituary>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/world/africa/02suzman.html?pagewanted=1&ref=africa|title=Helen Suzman, Relentless Challenger of Apartheid System, Is Dead at 91 |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=01-10-2009 | first1=John F. | last1=Burns | first2=Alan | last2=Cowell | date=2 January 2009}}</ref>

Suzman was noted for her strong public criticism of the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party's]] policies of [[apartheid]] at a time when this was atypical of white South Africans, and found herself even more of an outsider because she was an English-speaking Jewish woman in a parliament dominated by [[Calvinist]] [[Afrikaner]] men. She was once accused by a minister of asking questions in parliament that embarrassed South Africa, to which she replied: "It is not my questions that embarrass South Africa; it is your answers".<ref>[http://www.hsf.org.za/shelen2.asp The Helen Suzman Foundation]</ref>

Later, as parliamentary white opposition to apartheid grew, the Progressive Party merged with [[Harry Schwarz]]'s Reform Party and became the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]]. It was renamed the [[Progressive Federal Party]], and Suzman was joined in parliament by notable liberal colleagues such as [[Colin Eglin]]. She spent a total of 36 years in parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Obituary: Helen Suzman | journal =The Economist | volume =390 | issue =8613 | page =73 | publisher =The Economist Newspaper Ltd | location =London, United Kingdom | date =10 January 2009 | url = | doi = | accessdate = }}</ref>
