'''T.G.I. Friday's''' (often referred to as just "Fridays") is a popular [[United States|American]] [[List of restaurant chains|restaurant chain]] focusing on [[casual dining]], with over 500 [[restaurant]]s across the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Australia]] and [[the UK]], as well as many other countries around the world. The company is a unit of the [[Carlson Companies]]. The name is taken from the expression "[[TGIF]]", or "Thank God It's Friday."  The restaurant chain is known for its appearance, with red-striped canopies, brass railings, [[Tiffany lamp]]s, and frequent use of [[antiques]] as decor.

==History==
The Friday's restaurant chain was founded in 1965 in [[New York City]], featuring standard [[Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]], [[pub grub|bar food]], and alcoholic beverages. The exterior featured a red-and-white striped awning, and blue paint, and the interior included wooden floors, [[Bentwood]] chairs, and striped tablecloth. The bar area added brass rails, and stained glass. The employees were young, with wacky uniforms, and every time someone had a birthday, the whole restaurant crew came around with a cake, and singing Friday's traditional Birthday song. The restaurant's second location was established in 1970 in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]'s Overton Square district. That location has since closed. 

The oldest continually operating Friday's is in Louisville, Kentucky on Linn Station Road. It opened in August 1977 and at the time was the 31st store in operation. This location will be celebrating a 30 year anniversary in 2007. 

Friday's has also been used as a restaurant for hotels run by the [[Holiday Inn]] brand.

==Design==
The newer T.G.I. Friday's franchises, or redesigned ones, are more contemporary, with wallpaper, granite exteriors, and red-and-white striped lamps, instead of Tiffany. The exteriors have stucco, the entrance doors have "F" shaped handles, and a metal cup above the door with a stripe saying "In Here, It's always Friday". Most Friday's have a [[propeller]] and a [[canoe]] on display as part of their antiques.

==Food and drink==
Friday's has a large menu with an emphasis on [[alcoholic beverage]]s. A section of their menu is dedicated to the "Jack Daniel's Grill", a selection of items flavored with a special [[Jack Daniel's]] sauce. Fridays formerly was associated with [[Atkins Nutritional Approach|Atkins]] approved appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Since 2006, the menu has discontinued the Atkins name and several platters were redubbed "Low Carb". 

In turn the company licenses its name to [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] for foods such as [[potato chip|snack items]] and frozen foods in grocery stores around the USA.

*The [[Saturday Night Live]] episode of January 13, 2001 featured a sketch set in a TGI Friday's, where host [[Charlie Sheen]] played a customer out for dinner with his girlfriend, [[Will Ferrell]] played "Thaddeus Garfield Ignatius Friday," and [[Chris Kattan]] played Friday's son as a rude waiter who ruins the couple's dinner. 

*Another parody of the restaurant occurred in the 2002 [[Futurama]] episode "[[Anthology of Interest II]]" where a human version of the character [[Bender]] is seen stumbling out of a [[D.U.I.]] Friday's, which shares the same logo style and lollipop-stripe color scheme.

*In episode 160 of '[[King of the Hill]]' first aired Sunday Feb. 15 2004, a character in the show speaking to 'Bill' said "you must find it difficult living here with no 24-hour gym and no TGI Friday's".

*Yet another parody is found in the 2005 [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] episode [[Selling Out (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Selling Out]]. Mr. Krabs sells the beloved [[Krusty Krab]] to a group which changes the name to '''"Krabby O'Mondays"''' (which is also a parody of [[Beef o' Brady's]]) along with the famous red canopies and suspender wearing servers. Squidward even is requested to sing the famous Birthday Song to a young tyke.

*In the 2006 movie [[Click (film)|Click]] some executives from Japan said that T.G.I. Friday's was "America's greatest cultural achievement".

*A commercial of [[The Simpsons]] when Homer is dreaming about the TGI Friday's appitizer.

*The "Annoying Waitress" sketch on [[The Catherine Tate Show]] is a clear parody of TGI Fridays, with the employees of the restaurant dressed in wacky costumes with lots of badges, and ridiculously exaggerated celebrations when customers order a certain item off the menu.

*[[George Carlin]] rants about the cuteness of the restaurant's name, and suggests a better name would be H.S.I.O.W, or Holy Shit, It's Only Wednesday.

*Chef [[Anthony Bourdain]] often refers to sub-par chain restaurants as "T.G.I. McFunster's" on his [[Travel Channel]] show [[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]].
