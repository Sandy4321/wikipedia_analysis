The '''Daniel S. Schanck Observatory''' is a former [[observatory|astronomical observatory]] on the [[Queens Campus]] of [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It is located along George Street near the corner with Hamilton Street at the side of the car park to [[Kirkpatrick Chapel]], to the northeast of [[Geology Hall]].

The two-story [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] building of the observatory was designed by architect Willard Smith after the [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]] and was built in 1865. It was named after New York City businessman Daniel S. Schanck, who donated a large portion of the funds to construct and equip the observatory. Outfitted with [[telescope]]s, [[clock]]s, and other scientific equipment donated to Rutgers, the Schanck Observatory served as the university's first astronomical observatory and was used to provide instruction to its students through the nineteenth and early twentieth century.

The observatory has not been in use since the 1960s. As part of the Queens Campus, the Schanck Observatory was included on the [[New Jersey Register of Historic Places]] and the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1973. The building was renovated in 2012.
