Born '''Mary Frances Luecke''' in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Frann was a [[Model (person)|child model]] and appeared in commercials for a local television station while she was at [[Nerinx Hall High School]].

Frann studied drama at [[Northwestern University]] in [[Evanston, Illinois]], where she joined [[Delta Gamma]] sorority and worked as weather reporter for the [[NBC]] station in St. Louis.

In 1964, Frann made her television debut in an episode of the ''[[Kraft Suspense Theatre]]''. That same year, she appeared in the television movie ''Nightmare in Chicago'' with [[Carroll O'Connor]]. In [[1966 in film|1966]], Frann made her film debut in ''Nashville Rebel'' with [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Loretta Lynn]]. The movie was a commercial failure. Frann would go on to appear in only one more film, 1976's ''Woman in the Rain'', concentrating on television guest spots and roles in television movies.

In 1974, Frann landed the role of Amanda Howard on the [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of our Lives]]''. She would remain on the show until 1979. While on ''Days of our Lives'', Frann also made guest appearances on TV series such as ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'', ''[[The Rockford Files]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', and ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]''. In 1982, Frann starred in the short lived series ''[[King's Crossing]]'' with [[Linda Hamilton]]. Later that year, she landed her most memorable role as Joanna Loudon, the wife of Vermont inn owner Dick Loudon ([[Bob Newhart]]), in the popular [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Newhart]]''. The series ran from 1982 to 1990, and was nominated for 25 [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and five [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]]. During the run of ''Newhart'', Frann continued acting in various projects. In 1985, she co-starred in the TV movie ''Gidget's Summer Reunion'', and in 1988, she appeared in ''[[Dance 'Til Dawn]]'' with [[Alyssa Milano]], [[Christina Applegate]], and [[Kelsey Grammer]].

Frann co-hosted the [[Miss USA]] and [[Miss Universe]] pageants of 1986 and 1987.  Her last acting role came in the series ''[[Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction]]''.
