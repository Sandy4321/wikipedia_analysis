'''Wayne Mark Rooney''' (born 24 October 1985) is an English [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Aged 10, Rooney joined the youth team of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], for whom he made his professional debut in 2002. He spent two seasons at the [[Merseyside]] club, before moving to Manchester United for <U+00A3>25.6&nbsp;million in the 2004 summer transfer window. Since then, United has won the Premier League three times, the [[UEFA Champions League 2007<U+2013>08|2007<U+2013>08 UEFA Champions League]] and two [[Football League Cup|League Cups]]. He has also been awarded the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 2009<U+2013>10.

Rooney made his [[England]] national team debut in 2003 and, at [[UEFA Euro 2004]], he briefly became the competition's youngest goalscorer. He is frequently selected for the England squad and also featured at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. As of September 2010, he has won 67 international [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 26 goals.<ref name=RooneyProfile/>

==Early life==
Rooney was born in [[Croxteth]], [[Liverpool]] to Thomas Wayne and Jeanette Marie Rooney (n<U+00E9>e Morrey).<ref>[http://www.harpercollins.co.uk/Authors/7515/wayne-rooney Wayne Rooney] Harper Collins</ref> He is of [[Irish people|Irish]]<ref>{{cite web |date=23 May 2006|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,417769,00.html|title= Wayne Rooney Britain's Backstreet Boy|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=9 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=17 December 2006|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/celebrity/article755983.ece|title= Some have celebrity thrust upon them|publisher=[[The Times]]|accessdate=9 July 2010 | location=London | first=Hunter | last=Davies}}</ref> descent and was brought up [[Catholic]] in Croxteth with younger brothers Graeme and [[John Rooney (footballer)|John]];<ref>[http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/0502_graham_rooney.shtml ''Roo been had'' News of the World]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1312932,00.html ''Rooney's Brother Set To Play For Ireland''] Sky News</ref> all three attended [[De La Salle Humanities College|De La Salle School]].

==Club career==
===Everton===
Rooney began playing for Liverpool Schoolboys and at the age of 10 was signed on schoolboy terms by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061024/ai_n16798326 |title=Rooney at 21 |first=Andy |last=Hunter |work=[[The Independent]] |date=24 October 2006}}</ref> After scoring in an [[FA Youth Cup]] match, he revealed a T-shirt under his jersey that read, ''"Once a Blue, always a Blue."''<ref>{{cite web |date=1 September 2005 |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/players/past/Rooney.asp |title=Everton Past Players: Wayne Rooney |publisher=ToffeeWeb |accessdate=22 March 2007 }}</ref> Since he was under 17 at the time and therefore ineligible for a professional contract, he was playing for [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]80 a week and living with his family on one of the country's most deprived [[Council house|council estates]].

On 19 October 2002, five days before his 17th birthday, Rooney scored a match-winning goal against reigning league champions [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]; in addition to ending Arsenal's 30-match unbeaten run,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2317767.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rooney ends Arsenal's run | date=19 October 2002}}</ref> it made Rooney the youngest goalscorer in Premier League history, a record that has since been surpassed twice; first by [[James Milner (footballer)|James Milner]] and then by [[James Vaughan (footballer born 1988)|James Vaughan]]. He was named BBC Sports' 2002 [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year|Young Personality of the Year]]. 

At the end of the 2003<U+2013>04 season, citing Everton's inability to challenge for European competition (they had finished seventh the previous season and only just missed out on a UEFA Cup place, but in 2003<U+2013>04, finishing in 17th place, had narrowly avoided relegation), Rooney requested a transfer that Everton refused to oblige unless the transfer fee was in excess of <U+00A3>50&nbsp;million. A three-year, <U+00A3>12,000-a-week contract offer from the club was snubbed by Rooney's agent in August 2004, leaving Manchester United and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to compete for his signature. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Newcastle were close to signing Rooney for <U+00A3>18.5&nbsp;million, as confirmed by Rooney's agent, but Manchester United ultimately won the bidding war and Rooney signed at the end of the month after a <U+00A3>25.6&nbsp;million deal with Everton was reached.<ref>{{cite web |date=11 October 2005 |url=http://dps.twiihosting.net/manutd/doc/content/doc_10_139.pdf |title=Manchester United plc Report & Accounts 2005 |publisher=Manchester United plc |accessdate=16 November 2006 |format=PDF}}</ref> It was the highest fee paid for a player aged under 20; Rooney was still only 18 years old when he left Everton.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3607620.stm |title=Rooney worth the fight |date=14 August 2004 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=14 February 2007}}</ref>

===Manchester United===
====Debut season====
[[File:Wayne Rooney 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rooney playing for Manchester United]]
Rooney made his United debut on 28 September 2004 in a 6<U+2013>2 [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stage win over [[Fenerbah<U+00E7>e S.K.|Fenerbah<U+00E7>e]], scoring a hat-trick and laying on an assist.<ref>{{cite news |date=28 September 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3677174.stm |title=Rooney's debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce |work=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=11 May 2007}}</ref> However, his first season at [[Old Trafford]] ended without winning a trophy as United could only manage a third place finish in the league (having been champions or runners-up on all but two previous occasions since 1992) and failed to progress to the last eight of the [[European Cup|UEFA Champions League]]. United had more success in the cup competitions, but were edged out of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in the semi finals by a [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] side who also won the Premier League title that season, and a goalless draw with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[2005 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] was followed by a penalty shoot-out defeat. However, Rooney was United's top league scorer that season with 11 goals, and was credited with the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] award.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=43294 Wayne Rooney <U+2013> Manchester United FC] Football Heroes</ref>

====2005<U+2013>07====
In September 2005, Rooney was [[red card (football)|sent off]] in a [[UEFA Champions League]] clash with [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] of [[Spain]] (which ended in a goalless draw) for sarcastically clapping the referee who had booked him for an unintentional foul on an opponent.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/rooney-clapped-out-fergie-left-fuming/2005/09/15/1126750078545.html Rooney clapped out, Fergie left fuming] The Age</ref> His first trophy with United came in the [[Football League Cup 2005-06|2006 League Cup]], and he was also named [[man of the match]] after scoring twice in United's 4<U+2013>0 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in the [[Football League Cup Final 2006|final]]. In the Premier League, however, an erratic start to the season left title glory looking unlikely for United and their title hopes were ended in late April when they lost 3<U+2013>0 at home to champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and had to settle for second place. Rooney's goalscoring further improved in the [[2005-06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06 season]], as he managed 16 goals in 36 Premier League games.

Rooney was sent off in an [[Amsterdam Tournament]] match against [[F.C. Porto|Porto]] on 4 August 2006 after hitting Porto defender [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]] with an elbow.<ref>{{cite news |date=4 August 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/5247208.stm |title=Rooney & Scholes off in friendly |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref> He was punished with a three-match ban by [[The Football Association|the FA]], following their receipt of a 23-page report from referee Ruud Bossen that explained his decision.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 August 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/4796139.stm |title=Rooney & Scholes lose ban appeals|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref> Rooney wrote a letter of protest to the FA, citing the lack of punishment handed down to other players who were sent off in friendlies. He also threatened to withdraw the FA's permission to use his image rights if they did not revoke the ban, but the FA had no power to make such a decision.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lawton, James | date=19 September 2006 |url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/comment/article1619219.ece |title=James Lawton: What's wrong with Wayne Rooney? |publisher=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=14 September 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

During the first half of the 2006<U+2013>07 season, Rooney ended a ten-game scoreless streak with a hat-trick against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]],<ref name="IHT">[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/28/sports/EU_SPT_SOC_English_Roundup.php Rooney hat trick helps Man United to 4<U+2013>0 win] <U+2013> International Herald Tribune, 28 October 2006</ref> and he signed a two-year contract extension the next month that tied him to United until 2012. By the end of April, a combination of two goals in an 8<U+2013>3 aggregate quarter-final win over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and two more in a 3<U+2013>2 semi-final first leg victory over [[A.C.

Rooney collected his first Premier League title winner's medal at the end of the [[2006-07 FA Premier League|2006<U+2013>07 season]], but has yet to pick up an [[FA Cup]] winner's medal; he had to settle for a runners-up medal in the [[2007 FA Cup Final]].

====2007<U+2013>09====
On 12 August 2007, Rooney fractured his left [[metatarsal]] in United's opening-day goalless draw against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]];<ref name="reuters">[http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL1301174520070813 Rooney's broken foot adds to England injury crisis] <U+2013> Reuters UK, 13 August 2007</ref> he had suffered the same injury to his right foot in 2004.<ref name="bbcsport">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/3837995.stm Rooney faces two months out] <U+2013> BBC Sport, 26 June 2004</ref> After being sidelined for six weeks, he returned for United's 1<U+2013>0 Champions League group stage win over Roma on 2 October, scoring the match's only goal.

On 4 October 2008 in an away win over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], Rooney became the youngest player in league history to make 200 appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldsoccer.com/2008/10/premier-league-week-7-round-up.html |title=Rooney becomes youngest Premier League player to play 200 games |publisher=Insideworldsoccer.com |date=2008-10-05 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref> On 14 January after scoring what turned out to be the only goal 54 seconds into the 1<U+2013>0 win over [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], Rooney limped off with a hamstring ailment in the eighth minute.

====2009<U+2013>10====
Rooney's start to the new campaign got off to great scoring ways, grabbing a goal in the 90th minute of the [[2009 FA Community Shield|2009 Community Shield]], though United lost the game to Chelsea on penalties. He then scored the only goal of the opening game of the [[Premier League 2009-10|2009<U+2013>10]] season against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], taking his overall United tally to 99.<ref name="Man Utd 1-0 Birmingham">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8197957.stm Man Utd 1<U+2013>0 Birmingham] <U+2013> ''BBC Sport,'' 16 August 2009</ref> He failed to score in the next game, a historic 1<U+2013>0 defeat to the hands of newly-promoted [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].

On 29 August, United played [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at [[Old Trafford]]. Rooney scored the equaliser from the penalty spot after [[Andrei Arshavin]] had put the Gunners ahead.

On 19 October 2010, manager Alex Ferguson stated at a press conference that Rooney has confirmed the "terribly disappointing" news that he has told United that he will not sign a new contract and "wishes to leave the club".<ref>http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=833731&sec=uefachampionsleague&cc=5901</ref> This came after a period of dispute as to the extent of Rooney's ankle injury, where Rooney had refuted Ferguson's claim that the injury was the reason Rooney had been dropped to the bench.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/9090179.stm | work=BBC News | title=Rooney denies ankle injury claim | date=13 October 2010}}</ref> The next day, Rooney and his representatives released a statement regarding his decision to leave the club.

Rooney made his return to the first team as a substitute against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan]] on 20 November before returning to the starting lineup on 24 November in the Champions League against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. He scored the winning goal from the penalty spot, giving United a 1&ndash;0 victory.

==International career==
[[File:Wayne Rooney.jpg|left|thumb|Rooney playing for [[England national football team|England]]]]
Rooney became the youngest player to play for [[England national football team|England]] when he earned his first cap in a friendly against [[Australia national football (soccer) team|Australia]] on 12 February 2003 at seventeen, the same age in which he also became the youngest player to score an England goal. Arsenal youngster [[Theo Walcott]] broke Rooney's appearance record by 36 days in June 2006.

His first tournament action was at [[Euro 2004]], in which he became the youngest scorer in competition history on 17 June 2004, when he scored twice against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]]; however, this record was topped by Swiss midfielder [[Johan Vonlanthen]] four days later. Rooney suffered an injury in the quarterfinal match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and England were eliminated on penalties.

Following a foot injury in an April 2006 Premier League match, Rooney faced a race to fitness for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. England attempted to hasten his recovery with the use of an oxygen tent, which allowed Rooney to enter a group match against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] and start the next match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. However, he never got back into game shape and went scoreless as England bowed out in the quarterfinals, again on penalty kicks.

Rooney was red-carded in the 62nd minute of the quarterfinal for stamping on Portugal defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]] as both attempted to gain possession of the ball, an incident that occurred right in front of referee [[Horacio Elizondo]]. Rooney's United teammate [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] openly protested his actions, and was in turn shoved by Rooney. Elizondo sent Rooney off, after which Ronaldo was seen winking at the Portugal bench. Rooney denied intentionally targeting Carvalho in a statement on 3 July, adding, ''"I bear no ill feeling to Cristiano but I'm disappointed that he chose to get involved. I suppose I do, though, have to remember that on that particular occasion we were not teammates."''<ref>{{cite news |date=3 July 2006 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373186&cc=5739 |title=Rooney claim: No intent and no ill will |work=[[Soccernet]] |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref> Elizondo confirmed the next day that Rooney was dismissed solely for the infraction on Carvalho.<ref>{{cite news |date=4 July 2006 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373212&cc=5739 |title=Ronaldo cleared over Rooney red card |work=[[Soccernet]] |accessdate=17 November 2006}}</ref> Rooney was fined [[Swiss franc|CHF]]5,000 for the incident.<ref>{{cite news |date=10 July 2006 |url=http://worldcup.reuters.co.uk/england/news/usnL08917618.html |title=FIFA hands Rooney two-match ban |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=17 November 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in South Africa, after England drew with [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]], the England players were booed off the pitch by supporters. Rooney made a comment as he left the pitch to television cameras saying, "Nice to see your home fans boo you, that's loyal supporters".<ref>{{cite news|title=England v Algeria: Wayne Rooney blasts 'loyal supporters' for booing team|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/england/7839459/England-v-Algeria-Wayne-Rooney-blasts-loyal-supporters-for-booing-team.html|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=5 July 2010|date=18 June 2010 | location=London}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He has since apologised for the comment,<ref>{{cite news|title=England's Rooney says sorry for rant on camera|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65I27K20100619|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 July 2010|author=Andrew Cawthorne|date=19 June 2010}}</ref> made during a lacklustre tournament for England who were eliminated in the second round.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Rooney met his wife, [[Coleen Rooney]] (n<U+00E9>e McLoughlin), while both were in their final year of secondary school. They married on 12 June 2008 after six years of dating, during which Rooney admitted to soliciting prostitution in Liverpool in 2004. '"I was young and stupid. It was at a time when I was very young and immature and before I had settled down with Coleen."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/3588112.stm| title=Rooney admits prostitute visits| publisher=BBC| date=22 April 2004| accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref> He has a tattoo of the words "[[Just Enough Education to Perform]]", the title of an album by his favorite band, the [[Stereophonics]]; Coleen arranged for the group to play at their wedding reception.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/news/stereophonics/37949| title=Wayne Rooney gets Stereophonics tattoo| publisher=NME.com| date=9 June 2008| accessdate=8 September 2008}}</ref> The wedding ran into some controversy with the [[Catholic Church]]. The couple held a religious ceremony at La Cervara, a converted monastery near [[Genoa]], despite being warned by the local bishop's office against the plan. The bishop's office told the Rooneys that La Cervara is deconsecrated and not suitable for a wedding. It suggested a different church, five miles away. Nevertheless, the couple ignored the advice and Father Edward Quinn, their local priest from [[Croxteth]], presided over a ceremony in which rings were exchanged.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2138867/Wayne-Rooneys-wedding-to-Coleen-McLoughlin-not-valid-says-Catholic-Church.html| title=Wayne Rooney's wedding to Coleen McLoughlin 'not valid', says Catholic Church| publisher=The Telegraph| date=16 June 2008| accessdate=8 September 2008 | location=London | first=Malcolm | last=Moore}}</ref>

On 9 March 2006, Rooney signed the largest sports book deal in publishing history with [[HarperCollins]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4790978.stm |title=Striker Rooney nets <U+00A3>5m book deal |publisher=BBC |date=10 March 2006|accessdate=7 June 2006}}</ref> who granted him a <U+00A3>5&nbsp;million advance plus royalties for a minimum of five books to be published over a twelve-year period. The first, ''My Story So Far,'' an autobiography ghostwritten by [[Hunter Davies]], was published after the World Cup. The second publication, ''The Official Wayne Rooney Annual,'' was aimed at the teenage market and edited by football journalist [[Chris Hunt]].

In July 2006, Rooney's lawyers went to the [[United Nations]]' [[World Intellectual Property Organisation]] to gain ownership of the Internet domain names ''waynerooney.com'' and ''waynerooney.co.uk'', both of which Welsh actor Huw Marshall registered in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/5207766.stm |title=Rooney's legal fight for website |publisher=BBC |date=23 July 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref> Three months later, the WIPO awarded Rooney the rights to ''waynerooney.com.''<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/north_east/6048958.stm |title=Rooney wins his fight for website |publisher=BBC |date=13 October 2006|accessdate=22 February 2007}}</ref>

===Paul Stretford controversy===
In July 2002, while Rooney was with Everton, agent [[Paul Stretford]] encouraged Rooney and his parents to enter the player into an eight-year contract with Proactive Sports Management. However, Rooney was already with another representation firm at the time, while Stretford's transaction went unreported to the FA, and he was thus charged with improper conduct. Stretford alleged in his October 2004 trial that he had secretly recorded boxing promoter John Hyland (an associate of Rooney's first agent) and two other men threatening and attempting to blackmail him for an undisclosed percentage of Rooney's earnings.<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/2305232/Wayne-Rooney%27s-agent%2C-Paul-Stretford%2C-banned.html Wayne Rooney's agent, Paul Stretford, banned] <U+2013> The Telegraph, 22 July 2008</ref>

Stretford's case collapsed due to evidence that conflicted with his insistence that he had not signed Rooney, and on 9 July 2008, he was found guilty of ''"making of false and/or misleading witness statements to police, and giving false and/or misleading testimony."''<ref name="telegraph"/> In addition, the contract to which Stretford had signed Rooney was two years longer than the limit allowed by the FA. Stretford was fined <U+00A3>300,000 and banned from working as a football agent for eighteen months, a verdict he promptly appealed.<ref name="telegraph"/>

Stretford left Proactive in 2008 and took Rooney with him. Proactive later sued Rooney, claiming <U+00A3>4.3 million in withheld commissions.  In July 2010, Proactive was awarded only <U+00A3>90,000 as restitution.<ref name="guardian">[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/15/wayne-rooney-proactive-paul-stretford Manchester United's Wayne Rooney wins court case brought by Proactive] <U+2013> The Guardian, 15 July 2010</ref>

===David Moyes===
On 1 September 2006, Everton manager [[David Moyes]] sued Rooney for libel after the tabloid newspaper ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'' published excerpts from Rooney's [[Wayne Rooney#Personal life|2006 autobiography]] that accused the manager of leaking Rooney's reasons for leaving the club to the press.<ref>{{cite news |author=Paolo Bandini & agencies |title=Rooney book could be pulped|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=1 September 2006|date=1 September 2006 |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,1862946,00.html | location=London}}</ref> The case was settled out of court for <U+00A3>500,000 on 3 June 2008, and Rooney apologized to Moyes for ''"false claims"'' he had made in the book regarding the matter.<ref name="moyes">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2069407/Wayne-Rooney-settles-autobiography-libel-dispute-with-Everton-manager-David-Moyes.html Wayne Rooney settles autobiography libel dispute] <U+2013> The Telegraph, 3 June 2008</ref>

===Allegations of infidelity===

Rooney, reportedly had sex with a prostitute, Jennifer Thompson. It is understood his lawyers tried to fight the allegations when they first surfaced in early August 2010. He was unable to prevent the publication of the fresh allegations because he had previously spoken of his shame at paying for sex, it is understood. Details of Rooney<U+2019>s alleged infidelities came to light on 5 September 2010 after the Manchester United forward decided not to pursue a super-injunction to suppress the allegations. They included claims that he had intercourse with the prostitute while his wife Coleen was pregnant.<ref name="Affair Claims">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/7982734/Wayne-Rooney-slept-with-prostitute-while-wife-Coleen-was-pregnant.html Affair] <U+2013> The Telegraph, 5 September 2010</ref> Alex Ferguson has suggested Rooney's form for Manchester United had suffered as he is struggling to cope with the intense media scrutiny surrounding his private life due to these allegations.<ref name="Furgeson">[http://www.footballfancast.com/2010/09/football-news/sir-alex-ferguson-admits-wayne-rooney-is-struggling Sir alex ferguson admits wayne rooney is struggling] </ref>
