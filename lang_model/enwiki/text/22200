'''''The Big Eat''''' is a one hour factual entertainment documentary shown on [[Channel 4]] and produced by [[Twofour]] which follows the search for and training of a [[United Kingdom|British]] Champion to compete in the Competitive Eating World Championships in [[New York]].

The competition was won by Rob "Baby-Face" Burns, a 34-year-old from Wolverhampton. He ate 18 mini-pork pies in 12 minutes, but could only finish last in the 2005 [[IFOCE]]/[[Nathan's Famous]] competition at [[Coney Island]], where he finished on 10 hot-dogs. Andy Kocen (a stockbroker, but known as "The Doctor" on account of his medical degree) finished second by only one pork pie, soundly beating Jimmy "Oyster" Glackin, one-time holder of the world record for [[Guinness]] and oyster consumption (a pint and a dozen oysters in 13 seconds).
