'''Owen Hunt''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[medical drama]] television series ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which airs on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States. The character was created by series' producer [[Shonda Rhimes]], and is portrayed by actor [[Kevin McKidd]]. He was introduced in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season five]] as a [[US army|U.S. Army]] [[trauma surgeon]] who served in [[Iraq war|war-torn]] [[Iraq]], and consequently joins the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital to teach medicine as a [[Attending physician|surgical attending]], head of [[trauma surgery]], and eventual chief of surgery, sometimes with unorthodox methods. Originally contracted to appear for a multi-episode story arc, he was upgraded to a series' regular at the conclusion of his first appearance. 

The fictional character serves as a love interest for [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] [[Cristina Yang]], and has an unstable personality when first introduced, suffering from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]]. McKidd's connection with fellow actress [[Sandra Oh]] (Cristina Yang) has been acclaimed amongst critics, with Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' calling the "instant sparks" between McKidd and Oh "electrifying". McKidd was nominated for two awards for his work on the show, successfully winning one of them. Chris Monfette of [[IGN]] has praised the addition of "fresh, new characters" such as Owen Hunt. 

==Storylines==
Before his regular appearances on the show, Owen Hunt was a [[United States Army]] surgeon, specializing in [[trauma surgery]]. The character makes a dramatic first appearance when he performs a [[tracheotomy]] on a man with a pen, winning the admiration of [[Residency (medicine)|resident]] [[Cristina Yang]]. He is offered a job by former chief of surgery [[Richard Webber]], but declines, explaining that he has not completed his tour in Iraq.<ref>{{Cite episode|title=Dream a Little Dream of Me|date=September 25, 2008|accessdate=May 16, 2012|series=Grey's Anatomy|serieslink=Grey's Anatomy|network=[[American Broadcasting Company]]|season=5}}</ref> He later becomes the new head of trauma surgery, at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, and manages to irk both [[Derek Shepherd]] and [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]], head of [[neurosurgery]] and [[plastic surgery]], respectively, who view his treatment of some of the patients as crude.

I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I have been in the job right from day one when everybody's new and getting to know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before.

===Characterization===

{{Quote box|quoted=true|salign=left|width=300px|align=left| quote = There's a great debate there for what the dynamic is, with what Cristina has done to this marriage and her choice and what Owen's choice is and his behavior. There's a really interesting conversation to be had because of those choices: How do you move on? How does that change the dynamic of the relationship? If you can really dive into that -- there's two betrayals, very big ones. I don't know how they sustain that relationship. I don't know how you come back from that kind of betrayal. Certainly if you're married, the notion of the next step would be to have children and if that's been taken away, I would find it very hard for Owen to stay in that relationship.| source= <U+2014> [[Patrick Dempsey]] ([[Derek Shepherd]]) on Owen and Cristina's relationship, involving Cristina's no desire to bear children.<ref name=bettersoon>{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title='Grey's Anatomy' Postmortem: Kevin McKidd Warns of Tougher Times Ahead for Cristina|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-kevin-mckidd-owen-cristina-spoilers-300619|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref>}}
McKidd said of his character: "[...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some [[darkness]] to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...]"<ref name=buddytv/> Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, a sort of a guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with."<ref name="Ask Grey's Anatomy, Part 3">{{cite video|people =[[Kevin McKidd]]|title =Ask Grey's Anatomy, Part 3|url= http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/index?pn=askgreysanatomy|medium = Adobe Flash Player| publisher = [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC.com]]|accessdate = May 20, 2009}}</ref> McKidd's [[unorthodox]] teaching methods have been the subject of controversy. McKidd said of this: {{quote|"You know, I think, at the end of the day, [Owen]'s basically a good man who has some pretty extreme teaching techniques that he learned in the army. And all these things that are in the show are actually the way trauma surgeons are taught. But I think probably beyond that, he very much just calls a spade a spade and looks at each scenario. He's not trying to be difficult. He just looks at each scenario and each case and each patient and knows what is needed and when to cut to the chase, and doesn't want to mess about with the periphery of it. And sometimes that gets him into trouble, and sometimes that is for the best. So, it'd be interesting and kind of exciting to see where he goes."|Kevin McKidd|BuddyTV<ref name=buddytv/>|/quote}} The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the [[antithesis]] of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him.<ref name=marines/> When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told ''[[TV Guide]]'': "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [because of war]."<ref name=tvguide1>{{cite web|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Grey's Anatomy's Kevin McKidd: Love and War Haunt Hunt|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Anatomy-Kevin-1000004.aspx|work=TV Guide|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref>

The character of Owen Hunt had an almost instant attraction to Cristina Yang since his first appearance at Seattle Grace, illustrated by the passionate kiss they share soon after they meet. Owen's story and connection with fellow character [[Cristina Yang|Cristina]] has been a topic of discussion. McKidd said: "Between him [Owen] and her [Cristina], it<U+2019>s going to get really complex and kind of tense and explosive."<ref name=marines/> Owen and Cristina have experienced roadblocks in their fictional relationship, and continue to. McKidd offered this insight on his character's relationship with Cristina: [[File:Sandra Oh WGA adjusted.jpg|right|thumb|upright|McKidd and Oh's characters' relationship and connection has been a major aspect of Owen's characterization.]] {{cquote|It's not going to be easy for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, and this is just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet. It's almost more complicated, but on a really simplistic level, it's almost a love at first sight scenario that happened on the season premiere. And then, what we're seeing is the road to connect that back, because obviously the season premiere was before he went back to Iraq and this event has happened to him that's changed him. And so, they're trying to get that feeling back because there's obviously something really true and meant to be between these two people. But it's complicated right now because she's damaged because of what's happened to her, and he is certainly struggling with himself and the people around him and the world in general, and trying to keep himself together after what's happened to him. So, I think, it's exciting to see what happens with these two guys because, in a way, they're the two people you'd least expect to have a love affair, but it's happening to them and they can't stop it.<ref name=buddytv/>|/cquote}} McKidd has referred to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as "[[soulmate]]s."<ref name="nypost.com">{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/10262008/tv/no_kidding_135258.htm | work=New York Post | title=No Kidding | first=Robert | last=Rorke | date=October 26, 2008}}</ref> Speaking of Owen's [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder|PTSD]] storyline, McKidd stated: "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and Shonda [Rhimes], on a [[prime-time]] network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about.  But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people over the head with it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way."<ref name=tvguide1/> Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|season eight]], leading to Owen having a [[affair|sexual affair]]. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There<U+2019>s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he<U+2019>s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief."<ref name=struggle>{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first=Sandra|title='Grey's Anatomy' star Kevin McKidd previews Owen's struggles|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/04/12/greys-anatomy-star-kevin-mckidd-ew-video/|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 15, 2012}}</ref> Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'': "I think they're meant for each other.

==Reception==

The character has received generally positive feedback from television critics. Weeks after Hunt's first appearance on the show, Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' commented that "Hunt/McKidd is the most encouraging thing to happen to ''Grey's Anatomy'' in quite a while." He also added: "The instant sparks between him [Hunt] and Yang were electrifying."<ref name="Ask Grey's Anatomy, Part 3"/> On the other hand, Robert Rorke of the [[New York Post]] states that McKidd was brought in as Hunt to "boost the sagging fortunes" of the show's ratings.<ref name="nypost.com"/> Kelley L. Carter of ''[[USA Today]]'', describes Hunt as "hardcore" and "the [[antithesis]] of the other males on the show."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2008-11-05-kevin-mckidd-greys-anatomy_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Meet McKidd, new dreamboat doc on 'Grey's Anatomy' | first=Kelley L. | last=Carter | date=November 6, 2008 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref> Chris Monfette of [[IGN]] said that the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this in part to the introduction of "fresh, new characters", Owen and [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]).<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/988/988165p1.html|title=Grey's Anatomy: Season 5 Review |last=Monfette|first=Chris|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 29, 2009|accessdate=August 19, 2009}}</ref> He also referred to McKidd as "the [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|season [five]]]'s best, most effective addition", adding: {{cquote|Not only is McKidd an immediately likeable and engaging actor, his struggle with [[PTSD]] throughout the season <U+2013> and especially how it impacted his burgeoning relationship with Cristina <U+2013> proved both relevant and dramatically gripping.
