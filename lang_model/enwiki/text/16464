The '''Banker horse''' is a [[list of horse breeds|breed]] of [[feral horse|feral]] [[Horse|domestic horse]] (''Equus ferus caballus'') living on the islands of [[North Carolina]]'s [[Outer Banks]]. It is small, hardy, and has a docile temperament. Descended from domesticated [[Iberian horse|Spanish horses]] and possibly brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral [[foundation bloodstock]] may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands by one of the exploratory expeditions led by [[Lucas V<U+00E1>zquez de Ayll<U+00F3>n]] or Sir [[Richard Grenville]]. Populations are found on [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island]], [[Shackleford Banks]], [[Bodie Island|Currituck Banks]], and in the [[Rachel Carson]] Estuarine Sanctuary. 

Although they can trample plants and ground-nesting animals, and are not considered to be [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the islands, Bankers are allowed to remain because of their historical significance. They survive by grazing on marsh grasses, which supply them with water as well as food, supplemented by temporary freshwater pools.

To prevent overpopulation and inbreeding, and to protect their habitat from being overgrazed, the horses are managed by the [[National Park Service]], the State of North Carolina, and several private organizations. The horses are monitored for diseases such as [[equine infectious anemia]], an outbreak of which was discovered and subsequently eliminated on Shackleford in 1996, and they are safeguarded from traffic on the [[North Carolina Highway 12]]. Island populations are limited by adoptions and by birth control. Bankers taken from the wild and trained have been used for [[trail riding]], [[driving (horse)|driving]], and occasionally for mounted patrols.

== Characteristics ==
The typical Banker is relatively small, standing between {{hands|13.0|and|14.3}} high at the [[withers]]<ref name=Hendricks63>{{Harvnb|Hendricks|1995|p=63}}</ref> and weighing {{convert|800|to|1000|lb|kg}}.<ref name=GaitedHorse>{{cite web|url=https://dadair.securesites.net/thegaitedhorse.com/banker_horses.htm |title=Breed Profile: Banker Horses |accessdate=2009-01-12 |last=Campbell Smith |first=Donna |publisher=The Gaited Horse Magazine}}</ref> The forehead is broad and the facial profile tends to be straight or slightly convex. The chest is deep and narrow and the [[back (horse)|back]] is short with a sloped [[Rump (animal)|croup]] and low-set tail. Legs have an oval-shaped [[Equine forelimb anatomy|cannon bone]],<ref name=Sponeberg>{{cite web|url=http://www.horseweb.com/heritagebreedssouthwest/update.htm |title=North American Colonial Spanish Horse Update |accessdate=2009-01-11 |last=Sponenberg |first=D.

Several of the Banker's characteristics indicate that they share ancestry with other [[Colonial Spanish Horse]] breeds. The presence of the [[genetic marker]] ''Q-ac'' suggests that the horses share common ancestry with two other breeds of [[Iberian horse|Spanish descent]], the Pryor Mountain [[Mustang (horse)|Mustang]] and [[Paso Fino]], though these breeds diverged from one another 400&nbsp;years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacklefordhorses.org/timeline.htm |title=Shackleford Horses Timeline- History on Hooves: The Horses of Shackleford Banks |accessdate=2009-01-11 |last=Mason |first=Carolyn |date=1997-11-17 |publisher=The Foundation for Shackleford Horses }}</ref> The breed shares skeletal traits of other Colonial Spanish horses: the wings of the [[atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] are lobed, rather than semi-circular, and the spine may be fused at the fifth and sixth [[lumbar vertebrae]]. No changes in function result from these spinal differences. The convex facial profile common to the breed also indicates Spanish ancestry.<ref name=Sponeberg/>

== Breed history ==
Since they are free-roaming, Bankers are often referred to as [[Wild horse|"wild" horses]]; however, because they descend from domesticated ancestors, they are actually [[feral horse]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|pp=12&ndash;3}}</ref>  It is thought that the Bankers arrived on the [[barrier islands]] during the 16th century. Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the horses' origins, but none have yet been fully verified.
[[Image:NOAA- Outer Banks.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of a barrier island in the North Carolina Outer Banks]]
One theory is that ancestors of the Banker swam ashore from wrecked Spanish [[galleon]]s. Ships returning to Spain from the Americas often took advantage of both the [[Gulf Stream]] and continental [[trade wind]]s, on a route that brought them within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the Outer Banks. Hidden shoals claimed many victims, and earned this region the name "the [[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]". At least eight shipwrecks discovered in the area are of Spanish origin, dating between 1528 and 1564. These ships sank close enough to land for the horses to have been cast on the shores. Alternatively, during hazardous weather, ships may have taken refuge close to shore, where the horses may have been turned loose. However, the presence of horses on Spanish treasure ships has not been confirmed<U+2014>cargo space was primarily intended for transporting riches such as gold and silver.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|p=21}}</ref> 

Another conjecture is that the breed is descended from the 89&nbsp;horses brought to the islands in 1526 by Spanish explorer [[Lucas V<U+00E1>zquez de Ayll<U+00F3>n]]. His attempted colonization of [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] (near the [[Santee River]] in [[South Carolina]]) failed, forcing the colonists to move, possibly to North Carolina. V<U+00E1>zquez de Ayll<U+00F3>n himself and about 450 of the original 600&nbsp;colonists subsequently died, as a result of desertion, disease, and an early frost. Lacking effective leadership, the new settlement lasted for only two months; the survivors abandoned the colony and fled to [[Hispaniola]], leaving their horses behind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|pp=16&ndash;20}}</ref> 

A similar theory is that Sir [[Richard Grenville]] brought horses to the islands in 1585, during an attempt to establish an English naval base. All five of the expedition<U+2019>s vessels ran aground at Wococon (present-day [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]]).<ref name=Prioli257>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|pp=25&ndash;7}}</ref> Documents indicate that the ships carried various types of livestock obtained through trade in Hispaniola, including "mares, kyne [cattle], buls, goates, swine [and] sheep".<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1955 |p=187}}</ref> While the smaller vessels were easily refloated, one of Grenville<U+2019>s  larger ships, the ''Tiger'', was nearly destroyed. It is believed that in an attempt to lighten the ship the horses were either unloaded or thrown overboard and swam to shore. In a letter to Sir [[Francis Walsingham]] that same year, Grenville suggested that livestock survived on the island after the grounding of his ships.<ref name=Prioli257/>

==Life on the barrier islands==
[[Image:Shackleford Horse Digging Well.jpg|thumb|right|Drinking from a horse-dug water hole on Shackleford Banks]]  About 400&nbsp;Bankers inhabit the long, narrow barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks.<ref name=GaitedHorse/> These islands are offshore sediment deposits separated from the mainland by a body of water such as an estuary<ref name=NOAA> {{cite web|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/barrier.htm |title=Barrier Islands: Formation and Evolution |accessdate=2009-01-12 |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration }}</ref> or sound.<ref name=Hendricks63/> The islands can be up to {{convert|30|mi|km}} from the shore; most are less than one&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) wide. Vegetation is sparse and consists mainly of coarse grasses and a few [[Stunt (botany)|stunted]] trees.<ref name=Blythe>{{Harvnb|Blythe|1983|pp=63&ndash;72}}</ref> Each island in the chain is separated from the next by a tidal [[inlet]].<ref name=NOAA/>

The Bankers' small stature can be attributed, in part, to limited nutrients in their diet.<ref name=prioli12>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|p=12}}</ref>  They graze mostly on ''[[Spartina]]'' grasses,  but will feed on other plants such as bulrush (''[[Typha latifolia]]''), [[sea oats]],<ref name=BarrierSpit>{{Harvnb|Rheinhardt|Rheinhardt|2004|pp=253&ndash;8}}</ref> and even [[poison ivy]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|pp=211&ndash;3}}</ref> Horses living closer to human habitation, such as those on [[Bodie Island|Currituck Banks]], have sometimes grazed on residential lawns and landscaping.<ref name="BarrierSpit"/> Domesticated Bankers raised on manufactured horse feed from an early age tend to exhibit slightly larger frames.<ref name=prioli12/>

Water is a limiting resource for Bankers, as the islands are surrounded by [[seawater|salt water]] and have no [[freshwater]] springs or permanent ponds.<ref name=Blythe/>  The horses are dependent on ephemeral pools of rainwater and moisture in the vegetation they consume.<ref name="BarrierSpit"/> Bankers will dig shallow holes, ranging from {{convert|2.5|to|4|ft|m}} in depth, to reach fresh groundwater.<ref name=Blythe/> Occasionally, they may resort to drinking seawater. This gives them a bloated appearance, a consequence of water retention caused the body's effort to maintain [[osmoregulation|osmotic balance]].<ref name=PoultryBook>{{Harvnb|Dohner|2001|pp=400&ndash;1}}</ref>

== Land use controversies ==

The [[National Park Service]] (NPS) is concerned about the impact of Bankers on the environmental health of North Carolina's barrier islands. Initially, the NPS believed that the non-native Bankers would completely consume the ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]'' grasses and the maritime forests, as both were thought to be essential to their survival.<ref name=PoultryBook/>  However, research in 1987 provided information on the horses' diet that suggested otherwise. Half of their diet consisted of ''Spartina'', while only 4% of their nutrients came from the maritime forest. The study concluded that sufficient nutrients were replenished with each ocean tide to prevent a decline in vegetative growth from overgrazing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wood|Mengak|Murphy|1987|pp=236&ndash;44}}</ref> A 2004 study declared that the greatest impact on plant life was not from grazing but from the damage plants sustained when trampled by the horses' [[horse hoof|hooves]].<ref name="BarrierSpit" /> Bankers  pose a threat to ground-nesting animals such as [[sea turtle]]s and [[wader|shorebird]]s. Feral horses interrupt nesting activities, <ref> {{cite web|url=http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/10161/279/1/LaliberteJ.pdf |title=Natural Resource Assessment |accessdate=2009-01-23 |last=Lalibert<U+00E9> |first=Jennifer |format=PDF |work=National Parks Conservation Association |publisher=Duke University }}</ref> and can crush the young.<ref name=PoultryBook/>

== Management and adoption ==
[[Image:NCbarrierislandsmap.png|thumb|right|A map showing herd locations]]
As the Bankers are seen as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to remain on the barrier islands.<ref name=Dutson3235>{{Harvnb|Dutson|2005|p=323&ndash;5}}</ref> However, to cope with the expanding population, prevent [[inbreeding]] and attempt to minimize environmental damage, the herds are now managed by several organizations. 

===Ocracoke===

Since 1959, Bankers on [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island]] have been confined to fenced areas of approximately {{convert|180|acre|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on}}. The areas protect the horses from the traffic of [[North Carolina Highway 12]] as well as safeguarding the island from overgrazing. The NPS, the authority managing the Ocracoke herd, supplements the horses' diet with additional hay and grain. <ref name= NPSCH> {{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/caha/historyculture/ocracokeponies.htm|title=Ocracoke Ponies: The Wild Bankers of Ocracoke Island |accessdate=2008-11-11 |date=2003-11-07 |work=National Park Service: Cape Hatteras National Seashore |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service }}</ref> In 2006, as a precaution against inbreeding, two [[Colt (horse)|colts]] from the Shackleford herd were transported to Ocracoke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|p=77}}</ref>

===Shackleford===
[[Act of Congress|Public Law]] 105-229, commonly referred to as the [[Shackleford Banks]] Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120<U+2013>130&nbsp;horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine [[Porcine zona pellucida]] (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island<U+2019>s horse population is monitored by [[livestock branding|freeze branding]] numbers onto each animal<U+2019>s left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP. Since 2000, adoptions of Bankers from Shackleford have been managed by the Foundation for Shackleford Horses. As of 2007, 56&nbsp;horses had found new homes, 10 resided with another herd on [[Cedar Island, North Carolina|Cedar Island]], and two had been moved to the Ocracoke herd.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|pp=65&ndash;83}}</ref>[[Image:Branded Shackleford Pony.jpg|thumb|left|A freeze branded mare on Shackleford]]

On November 12, 1996, the Shackleford horses were rounded up by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Division and tested for [[equine infectious anemia]] (EIA). EIA is a potentially lethal disease, a [[lentivirus]] transmitted by bodily fluids and insects. Seventy-six of the 184&nbsp;captured horses tested positive. Those who tested negative were allowed to remain on the island and those with the disease were transported to a temporary quarantine facility. Finding a permanent, isolated area for such a large number of Bankers was a challenging task for the Foundation of Shackleford Horses; eight days later the state declared all proposed locations for the herd unsuitable and so the 76&nbsp;infected horses were euthanized. Two more horses died in the process&mdash;one who was fatally injured during the roundup and an uninfected [[foal]] that slipped into the quarantined herd to be with its mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|pp=61&ndash;3}}</ref>

===Currituck Banks===

As a consequence of [[Corolla, North Carolina|Corolla]]'s development in the 1980s, horses on [[Bodie Island|Currituck Banks]] came into contact with humans more frequently. By 1989, eleven Bankers had been killed by cars on the newly constructed Highway 12.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Wild Horses of North Carolina | date=2007 | publisher=NC Beaches Inc. | url =http://www.ncbeaches.com/Features/Wildlife/WildHorsesNorthCarolina/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-12-29 | language = }}</ref> That same year, the Corolla Wild Horse Fund, a nonprofit organization, was created to protect the horses from human interference. As a result of its efforts, a herd of 60 horses was moved to a more remote part of the island,<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.ncwanted.com/ncwanted_home/story/2966627/ |title=Corolla Horses: $ 12,550 Reward for Horse Shootings |accessdate=2008-11-11 |last=NC Wanted |date=2008 |work=NC Wanted |publisher=Capitol Broadcasting Company}}</ref> where they were fenced into {{convert|1800|acre|km2 sqmi|2|lk=on}} of combined federal and privately donated land. Corolla commissioners declared the site a feral horse sanctuary;<ref name=PoultryBook/> the population is now  managed by adopting out [[yearling (horse)|yearling]]s, both [[filly|fillies]] and [[gelding|gelded]] colts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corollawildhorses.com/adoption.html |title=Adoption Program |accessdate=2008-12-29 |date=2008-12-23 |publisher=Corolla Wild Horse Fund }}</ref>

===Rachel Carson Site, North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve===

A herd lives on the [[Rachel Carson]] component of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.nccoastalreserve.net/About-The-Reserve/National-Reserve-Sites/Rachel-Carson/58.aspx |title=Rachel Carson |accessdate=2009-03-15 |date=2007 |publisher=North Carolina Coastal Reserve }}</ref> There were no horses on the Sanctuary until the 1940s, and it is still unclear if the Bankers swam over from nearby Shackleford<ref name=Hendricks65>{{Harvnb|Hendricks|1995|p=65}}</ref>  or if they were left by residents who had used the islands to graze livestock.  They are owned and managed by the State of North Carolina and regarded as a cultural resource. No management action was taken until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when after years of flourishing population, the island<U+2019>s [[carrying capacity]] was exceeded.  Malnourishment caused by overcrowding resulted in the deaths of several horses; the reserve's staff then instituted a birth control program to regulate the herd to about 40&nbsp;animals.<ref name=NCreserve> {{cite web|url=http://www.nccoastalreserve.net/uploads/File/general/siteProfileChapter3%20.pdf |title=Rachel Carson Component |accessdate=2008-11-15 |last=Fear |first=John |coauthors=North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve |date=08-08 |work=North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve |publisher=North Carolina Coastal Reserve |format=PDF}}</ref>

== Uses ==
Adopted Bankers are often used for [[trail riding|pleasure riding]] and [[driving (horse)|driving]].<ref name=Dutson3235/> As they have a calm disposition,<ref name= Hendricks65/> they are used as children's mounts.<ref name=Dutson3235/> The breed has also been used in several mounted patrols.<ref name= Hendricks65/>

Before 1915, the United States Lifesaving Service used horses for beach watches and rescues. In addition to carrying park rangers on patrols,<ref name=Prioli48>{{Harvnb|Prioli|2007|p=48}}</ref> the horses hauled equipment to and from shipwreck sites.<ref name= NPSCH/> The Bankers were used for beach duty at Cape Hatteras National Seashore in the 1980s,<ref name=Prioli48/> and during World War II the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] also used them for patrols.<ref name= NPSCH/>

In 1955, ten horses were taken from the Ocracoke herd for Boy Scout Troop 290. After taming and [[livestock branding|branding]] the horses, the scouts then trained them for public service activities; the Bankers were ridden in [[parade horse|parades]] and used to spray mosquito-ridden salt marshes.<ref name=Prioli48/>
