'''Charles 'Don' Alias'''<ref>surname pronounced ah-LIE-ahs</ref> (b. [[December 25]],  [[1939]] [[New York City]]; d. [[March 29]], [[2006]] [[New York City]]) was an [[United States|American]] jazz [[percussionist]]. 

Alias was best known for his skill at  [[conga]]s and other [[hand drum]]s. He was, however, a capable [[drum kit]] performer: Alias played drums on the song "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" from ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1969) when neither [[Lenny White]] nor [[Jack DeJohnette]] was able to capture the [[marching band]] rhythm requested by trumpeter [[Miles Davis]].<ref>see the notes for ''The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions'' (1998)</ref>

Alias performed on hundreds of recordings, and was perhaps best known for his associations with [[Miles Davis]] and saxophonist [[David Sanborn]], though he also performed or recorded with the group [[Weather Report]], singer [[Joni Mitchell]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Brecker Brothers]], [[Jaco Pastorius]] and many others. It's a little known fact that West Indian born Alias arrived in Boston in the early 1960's intending to study medicine but after playing congas in a number of local bands make an abrupt career switch.
