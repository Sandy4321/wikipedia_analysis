'''Katherine Ann Power''' (born January 25, 1949) is an American ex-[[convict]] and long-time [[fugitive]], who, along with her fellow student and accomplice [[Susan Edith Saxe]], was placed on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Most Wanted Fugitives]] list in 1970. The two participated in robberies at a [[Massachusetts National Guard]] [[Armory (military)|armory]] and a bank in [[Brighton, Massachusetts|Brighton]], [[Massachusetts]] where [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] police officer Walter Schroeder was shot and killed. Power remained at large for 23 years.

A native of [[Colorado]], Power turned herself over to authorities in 1993 after starting a new life in [[Oregon]]. She was imprisoned in Massachusetts for six years before being released on 14-years' probation. While in prison, Power completed her bachelors degree and, after her release, earned a masters degree at [[Oregon State University]]. As of 2008, she resided in the Boston area.

In 1967, Power enrolled at Brandeis<ref name=people/> as a [[sociology]] major and honor student at a time of [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War]] protests at the school. She became known for wandering the campus braless and barefoot in an orange-colored [[Smock-frock|smock]],<ref name=time1970/> for her attendance at [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] protest rallies and for her involvement in the Brandeis Strike Information Center.<ref name=time1970/> She and her room-mate Susan Saxe worked to organize student protests for a committee known as the National Student Strike Force.<ref name=people/><ref name=oregonian2>{{cite news |last=Schulberg |first=Pete |title=Oregon Fugitive Tells Tale on 20/20 |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=February 10, 1994 |postscript=}}</ref> The two also became acquainted with fellow organizer [[Stanley Ray Bond]], an ex-convict and soldier attending classes at the university on a special program.<ref name=people/> He and Power became romantically involved.<ref>http://www.ashbrook.org/publicat/onprin/v1n3/wilson.html</ref>

==Protest and murder==
Through their association with Bond, Power and Saxe became involved in a plot to arm the [[Black Panthers]] as a response to United States involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=people/> Bond introduced them to former convicts William Gilday and Robert Valeri and together the group plotted to rob the State Street Bank & Trust.<ref name=people/> On September 20, 1970, the group robbed a [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] armory in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] and took 400 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=times/> They also stole weapons and set fire to the facility, causing about $125,000 in damage.<ref name=oregonian1>{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Tom |title=Power gets 5 years, fine, lecture |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |pages=D5 |date=November 25, 1993 |postscript=}}</ref>

Three days later, on September 23, 1970, the group robbed a bank in Brighton, Massachusetts, carrying handguns, a shotgun and a submachine gun.<ref name=time1970>{{cite journal |date=October 10, 1970 |title=The Radical Bank Job |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904338,00.html}}</ref><ref name=dispatch>{{cite news |title=Fugitive gives up |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=September 16, 1993 |postscript=}}</ref> The first police officer on the scene, Boston police officer Walter Schroeder, was shot in the back by Gilday when he attempted to stop the robbery.<ref name=wapost/> He subsequently died from his wounds. The group escaped with $26,000 in cash that they planned to use to finance an overthrow of the [[federal government]].<ref name=wapost/> Power was behind the wheel of one of the two getaway vehicles.<ref name=people/>

While raiding her apartment after the bank robbery, police found evidence tying Power to both robberies. This included weapons, ammunition and a [[telephone switchboard]] from the armory.<ref name=time1970/> Power's attorneys would subsequently blame her involvement in the robberies as the result of manipulation by her partner Bond.<ref name=wapost/>

==Fugitive==
Gilday, Valeri and Bond were captured shortly after the Brighton robbery. Bond died in custody while making a bomb as part of an escape bid, while Valeri [[Turn state's evidence|turned state's evidence]] and testified against Gilday. Valeri received a jail term of 25 years for the robbery, while Gilday received a [[life sentence]]. Power and Saxe eluded capture.<ref name=people/>

In November 1970, Power and Saxe became the sixteenth and seventeenth persons on the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitives list.<ref>{{cite journal |date=November 16, 1970 |title=Wanted by FBI |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904476,00.html}}</ref> At first, Power and Saxe traveled together, escaping arrest by hiding out in women<U+2019>s communes.<ref name=dispatch/> For part of this time, the two went to ground in [[Connecticut]] and Power assumed the name Mae Kelly.<ref name=wilson/> Saxe was able to elude arrest until 1975, when she was captured in [[Philadelphia]]. She then served five years in prison.<ref name=people/>

Prior to her surrender in 1993, Power had last been seen in [[Kentucky]] in 1974.<ref name=dispatch/> In 1977, she assumed the alias '''Alice Louise Metzinger''', taking the name from the birth certificate of an infant that had died the year before her birth.<ref name=wilson/><ref name=dispatch/> In 1979, moved west to Oregon<ref name=oregonian1/> and gave birth to a son, Jamie, by an unknown father.<ref name=wilson/>

As time went by, authorities received few tips regarding Power's location and she was eventually removed from the Most Wanted Fugitives list in 1984. The following year, she settled in [[Willamette Valley]], [[Lebanon, Oregon]] with her son Jamie and boyfriend Ron Duncan, a local meat cutter and bookkeeper.<ref name=people/><ref name=wapost/><ref name=time/> While living in Oregon, Power taught cooking classes at [[Linn-Benton Community College]] in [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] and worked at restaurants in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] and [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. She reached the shortlist for the post of food writer for the ''[[Corvallis Gazette-Times]]''&nbsp;<ref name=wapost/> and became part-owner of the Napoli Restaurant and Bakery restaurant in Eugene.<ref name=times/> 

Power had suffered from [[clinical depression]] since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist [[Linda Carroll]].<ref name="klieman">{{cite book |last=Klieman |first=Rikki J. |coauthors=Peter Knobler |title=Fairy Tales Can Come True: How a Driven Woman Changed Her Destiny |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |id=254 |isbn=0060524022}}</ref> She developed the desire to stop living her life under her assumed name<ref>{{cite journal |last=Krauthammer |first=Charles |date=October 4, 1993 |title=From People Power to Polenta |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979318,00.html}}</ref> and, through therapy that included participation in the [[mock trial]] of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends.<ref name=conscience/>

==Surrender==
In 1993, Katherine Ann Power negotiated a surrender with authorities and ended 23 years of hiding.<ref name=wapost/> Negotiations were carried out through her attorneys Steven Black, a public defender, and [[Rikki Klieman]], a prominent Boston lawyer.<ref name=people/> On September 15, 1993, she pleaded guilty to two counts of [[armed robbery]] and [[manslaughter]] in Boston.<ref name=people/><ref name=times/> At the time, her son Jamie was 14 years old and a freshman in high school, while Power was 44 years old.<ref name=wapost/><ref name=seattletimes>{{Cite news

In court, Power made the following statement about officer Schroeder:

Power was sentenced to eight to twelve years in prison for the bank robbery, and five years and a $10,000 fine for the National Guard armory crimes.<ref name=oregonian1/> Additionally, judge Robert Banks of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] Superior Court imposed a probation condition that Power could not profit from her crime.

The second five years were to be served concurrently with the eight to twelve year sentence, with a possibility of [[parole]] after five years.<ref name=oregonian1/> This probation condition also precluded her ability to profit directly or indirectly from telling her story.<ref name=uolaw>Epps, Garrett.

In her only public statement, Power said:

==Cultural references==
Since her surrender, Power and her story have been the basis for a variety of books and even a television episode of ''[[Law & Order]]''. The television episode was a 1994 episode of ''Law & Order'' entitled ''White Rabbit'' which was loosely based on her case. In the show, her character is called Susan Forrest and she is found after money from the robbery turns up in a private safety deposit box after a robbery. [[William Kunstler]] even appears in the episode playing himself as Forrest's lawyer.
