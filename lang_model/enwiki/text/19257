[[Image:Mexico.Tab.OlmecHead.01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Monument 1''', an Olmec colossal head at La Venta]]The '''Olmec''' were an ancient [[Pre-Columbian]] people living in the [[tropic]]al lowlands of south-central [[Mexico]], roughly in what are the modern-day [[mexican state|states]] of [[Veracruz]] and [[Tabasco]] on the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Their immediate cultural influence went much further though, Olmec artwork being found as far afield as [[El Salvador]]. The Olmec predominated in their lands from about [[1200 BC]] to about [[400 BC]] and they are, in fact, claimed by many to be the progenitors and [[mother culture]] of every primary element common to later [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations.

==Overview==
The Olmec heartland is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hill ridges and volcanoes. The [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas|Tuxtla Mountains]] rise sharply in the north, along the [[Bay of Campeche]].  Here the Olmecs constructed permanent city-temple complexes at several locations, among them [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl<U+00E1>n]], [[La Venta]], [[Tres zapotes|Tres Zapotes]], Laguna de los Cerros, and La Mojarra.  They also had great influence beyond the heartland: from [[Chalcatzingo]], far to the west in the highlands of Mexico, to [[Izapa]], on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast near what is now [[Guatemala]], Olmec goods have been found throughout Mesoamerica during this period. In this heartland, the first Mesoamerican civilization would emerge and reign from 1200&ndash;400 BC.  

The Olmec may have been the first Mesoamericans to develop a writing system, but no examples of it have yet been found.  At the present time, there is some debate as to whether or not symbols found in 2002 dated to 650 BC are actually a form of Olmec writing preceding the oldest [[Zapotec]] writing dated to about 500 BC.[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20021207/fob1.asp]  There are other later hieroglyphs known as "[[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec]]".  "Epi-Olmec" means "post Olmec", and while there are some who believe that Epi-Olmec may represent a transitional script between an earlier, unknown Olmec writing system and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] writing, the matter is for the time being unsettled.

The Olmec were perhaps the originators of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes&mdash;certainly they were playing it before anyone else has been documented doing so.

[[Image:Olmec Heartland 1.png|right|thumb|300px|Olmec Heartland]]Their religion developed all the important themes (an obsession with mathematics and with calendars, and a spiritual focus on death expressed through human sacrifice) found in successor groups. Finally, their political arrangements of strongly hierarchical city-state kingdoms were repeated by nearly every other Mexican and Central American civilization that followed.

==Etymology of the name==
The name "Olmec" means "rubber people" in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Mexica ("[[Aztec]]") people. It was the Aztec name for the people who lived in this area at the much later time of Aztec dominance. Ancient [[Mesoamerica]]ns, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, extracted [[latex]] from ''Castilla elastica,'' a type of [[rubber tree]] in the area. The juice of a local vine, ''Ipomoea alba,'' was then mixed with this latex to create [[rubber]] as early as [[1600 BC]] <ref>[http://web.mit.edu/org/m/materialculture/www/rubberprocessing.html]</ref>. The word "Olmec" also refers to the [[rubber]] balls used for their ancient ball game. Early modern explorers applied the name "Olmec" to the rediscovered ruins and art from this area before it was understood that these had been already abandoned more than a thousand years before the time of the people the Aztecs knew as the "Olmec". It is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as "Tamoanchan".

There is a general [[scientific consensus|consensus]] that the Olmec spoke a language in the [[Mesoamerican languages#Mixe-Zoquean|Mixe-Zoquean]] family, although the evidence is limited.<ref>Campbell, pp 80-89</ref>  The Olmec language remains unknown, with no living speakers.

==History==
===Early history===
Olmec culture originated at its base in San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, where distinctively Olmec features begin to emerge around 1150 BC. The rise of [[civilization]] here was probably assisted by the local ecology of well watered rich [[alluvial]] soil, encouraging high [[maize]] production. This ecology may be compared to that of other ancient centres of civilization: [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Nile]] valley. It is speculated that the dense population concentration at San Lorenzo encouraged the rise of an [[elite]] class that eventually ensured Olmec dominance and provided the social basis for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. 

Evidence of materials in San Lorenzo that must have come from distant locations suggests that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Central America. This was probably protected by some sort of military system. Sites such as [[Teopantecuanitlan]] show that the Olmecs were also living in Guerrero.

===Decline===
It is not known with any clarity what happened to this culture. Their main centre, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around [[900 BC]], and La Venta became the main city. Environmental changes may have been responsible for this move, with certain important rivers changing course. However, there is also some evidence suggestive of an invasion and destruction of Olmec artifacts around this time{{citation needed}}. Around [[400 BC]], La Venta also came to an end, although the importance of the ceremonial complexes apparently outlasted the Olmec state or culture.  Within a few hundred years of the abandonment of their last cities, successor cultures had become firmly established in their former lands&mdash;most notably the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] to the east, the [[Zapotec]] to the southwest, and the [[Teotihuacan]] culture to the west.

==Olmec art==
[[Image:Mexico.Tab.LaVenta.01.jpg|right|thumb|225px|'''"The Grandmother"''', Monument 5 at La Venta (reproduction)]]
Olmec artforms emphasize both monumental statuary and small [[jade]] carvings. Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the Pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic era art. Common [[motif (art)|motifs]] include downturned mouths and slit-like slanting eyes, both of which can be seen in most representations of [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|"were-jaguars"]]. [[Olmec figurine]]s are also found abundantly in sites throughout the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Pre-Classic Era|Formative Period]]. 

In addition to human subjects, Olmec artisans were adept at animal portrayals, for example, this ceramic [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/04/cam/ho_1986.45.htm ancient Olmec "Bird Vessel"], dating to circa [[1000 BC]]. [[Pottery|Ceramic]]s are produced in [[kiln]]s capable of exceeding approximately 900[[Celsius|<U+00B0> C]]. The only other [[prehistory|prehistoric]] culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of [[Ancient Egypt]] <ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_n3_v154/ai_21146424], see also [[faience]]</ref>.

===Olmec colossal heads===
Perhaps the best-recognized Olmec art are the enormous helmeted heads. As no known pre-Columbian text explains these, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Given the individuality of each, these heads seem to be portraits of famous ball players or perhaps kings rigged out in the accoutrements of the game.

According to Grove,<ref>Grove, p. 55</ref> the unique elements in the headgear can also be recognized in headdresses of human figures on other Gulf Coast monuments, suggesting that these are personal or group symbols.

The heads range in size from the Rancho La Corbata head, at 3.4 m high, to the pair at Tres Zapotes, at 1.47 m.  Some sources estimate that the largest weighs as much as 40 tons, although most reports place the larger heads at 20 tons.  

The heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic [[basalt]], quarried in the [[Sierra de los Tuxtlas|Tuxtla Mountains]].  It is likely that the heads were carried on large [[balsa]] rafts from the Llano del Jicaro quarry to their final locations.  To reach La Venta, roughly 80 km (50 miles) away, the rafts would have had to move out onto choppy waters of the [[Bay of Campeche]]. 

Some of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and  disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied.  Whether these actions were undertaken as a ritual or as a result of a conflict or conflicts is yet to be decided.

There have been 17 colossal heads unearthed to date.

===Pottery and trade===
In March 2005, a team of archaeologists used NAA (neutron activation analysis) to compare over 1000 ancient Mesoamerican Olmec-style ceramic artifacts with 275 samples of clay so as to "fingerprint" pottery origination.  They found that "''the Olmec packaged and exported their beliefs throughout the region in the form of specialized ceramic designs and forms, which quickly became hallmarks of elite status in various regions of ancient Mexico''"<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/olmec/index.html ''Archaeological Institute of America,]'' [[March 28]], [[2005]] </ref>.

In response, in August 2005 another study, this time using [[petrography]], found that the "''exchanges of vessels between highland and lowland chiefly centers were reciprocal, or two way.''" <ref>[http://www.news.wisc.edu/11377.html "New analysis of pottery stirs Olmec trade controversy". University of Wisconsin - Madison press release August 1, 2005]</ref>.  Five of the samples dug up in San Lorenzo were "unambiguously" from Oaxaca.  According to one of the archaeologists conducting the study, this "''contradicts recent claims that the Gulf Coast was the sole source of pottery''" in Mesoamerica.

The results of the INAA study were later defended in March 2006 in two articles in ''Latin American Antiquity''. Because the INAA sample is much larger than the petrographic sample (a total of over 1600 analyses of raw materials and clays vs. approximately 20 pottery thin sections in the petrographic study), the authors of the ''Latin American Antiquity'' papers argue that the petrographic study cannot possibly overturn the INAA study.

==Religion==
: ''See main article: [[Olmec mythology]]''

Olmec mythology has left no documents comparable to the [[Popul Vuh]] from [[Maya mythology]], and therefore any exposition of Olmec mythology must rely on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art and comparisons with other Mesoamerican mythologies.  Olmec art shows that such deities as the Feathered Serpent and the Rain Spirit were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times. 

==Mathematics==
:''See also: [[0 (number)#First use of the number|First use of the number zero]]''<br>
The late Olmec had already begun to use a true zero (a shell [[glyph]]) several [[centuries]] before [[Ptolemy]] (possibly by the [[fourth century BC]]).  This would later become an integral part of [[Maya numerals]].

==Alternative origin speculations==
[[Image:Olmec1.jpg|right|thumb|An Olmec head noted for its broad nose and full lips]]
Some members of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (Mormons) have suggested that the Olmecs may be the [[Jaredite]]s recorded in the [[Book of Mormon]] because of alleged similarities in the Olmec archaeological record. However, the book mentions things that are known not to have been part of the Olmec culture, such as iron, silk and elephants. This speculation is not supported by any aspect of conventional Mesoamerican scholarship.

Others have pointed to the full lips and broad noses of Olmec monuments as evidence that Olmec [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact|ancestry may trace back]] to west [[Africa]], but virtually all mainstream Mesoamerican scholars reject this and point out the central role of the "were-jaguar", half man, half cat, in early Mesoamerican religions.  Moreover, they point out that not all people with broad noses and full lips are African, and some [[Native American (Americas)|Native Americans]] of the region still display these traits today without any ancestral evidence for any of these possible lineages. Full lips and short broad noses are the norm among [[Mesoamericans]] and tropical peoples generally. It is also noted that the colossal Olmec monuments show eye folds found in the local Mesoamericans, a trait unknown among the peoples of West Africa.  

Some writers have also claimed that the Olmec were related to the [[Mand<U+00E9>]] peoples of West Africa even though there is absolutely no DNA evidence for this.  Such writers have also claimed that Olmec symbols are a script that encodes a [[Mande language]], even though there is no known Mande script until 1949.
<ref>[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/nko.htm N'ko Writing]</ref>
<ref>[http://geocities.com/Athens/Academy/8919/Rtolmec2.htm Argument in favor of Mande theory]</ref><ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/8919/decip1.html Further promotion of the theory]</ref> The script claimed to be related to Olmec is actually a set of North African petroglyphs which have not yet even been identified as writing at all, nor definitively connected to any African language let alone to the distant and as yet unknown Olmec language and writing.  Mainstream scholars remain unconvinced by these speculations. Others are more critical and regard the promotion of such unfounded theories as a form of ethnocentric racism at the expense of indigenous Americans.

By an overwhelming margin the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] view remains that the Olmec and their achievements are wholly indigenous to the region, founded entirely on a remarkable and ancient agriculture that was indigenous, and that they and neighbouring cultures, with whom they had contact, developed their own characters quite independently of any extra-hemispheric influences.
