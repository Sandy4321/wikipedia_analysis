===2005===
Bally roared into action in [[2005 WTA Tour|2005]] at the [[2005 Australian Open - Women's Singles|Australian Open]] qualifying tournament where she won three matches in straight sets to successfully qualify; she beat [[Els Callens]], [[Jaslyn Hewitt]] and [[Teryn Ashley]] in rounds one, two and three respectively. In the first round of the main draw she beat [[Katarina Srebotnik]], 5-7 6-4 6-4, who later remarked that the Brit was ''"on fire"'' and that ''"if [Elena] plays like today, she can beat anyone.

She then immediately reached the finals of another $25,000 ITF event (this one in [[Redbridge, London|Redbridge]]) before being beaten, 0-6 3-6, by [[Nika Ozegovic]]. She again played for [[Great Britain Fed Cup team|Great Britain]] in the [[2005 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]]. She lost her singles rubber against [[Ana Timotic]] from [[Serbia Fed Cup team|Serbia]], won her singles rubber verses [[Karina-Ildor Jacobsgaard]] and was demolished in her third singles rubber against Katarina Srebotnik, 1-6 1-6, in retribution for her first round Australian Open exit.

In June, three consecutive [[Wild card (sports)|wild cards]] granted her entry into the main draws of the [[AEGON Classic|DFS Classic]], the [[AEGON International|Hastings Direct International]] and [[2005 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] where she was beaten by [[Milagros Sequera]] in the second round (after beating Alona Bondarenko in the first), [[Conchita Martinez]] in round one<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/naff-games-cost-baltacha-acircpound50000-494181.html |title='Naff games' cost Baltacha <U+00C2><U+00A3>50,000 |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Sabine Klaschka]] in the first round respectively. Following Wimbledon, Elena traveled to the ITF circuit in the [[United States]] without much success; she won only one of five matches she played in the run-up to the [[2005 US Open - Women's Singles|US Open]] qualifying draw where she also lost in the first round of qualifying. She then returned to the ITF circuit and reached the quarterfinals of the $25,000 event in [[Glasgow]], the semifinals of the $25,000 event in [[Bolton]] and won the $25,000 tournament in [[Jersey]]. Her year-end singles ranking for the 2005 season was '''world No.122'''.<ref name='Activity'/>

===2006===
For Elena, [[2006 WTA Tour|2006]] was a year much shortened by injury. Her first tournament of the year was the qualifying event for the [[2006 Australian Open - Women's Singles|Australian Open]] where she lost to [[Yuan Meng]], 2-6 4-6, at the second stage of qualifying. In February she played one $25,000 [[2006 ITF Women's Circuit|ITF]] event (where she lost to [[Melanie South]] in the first round) and attempted to qualify for three consecutive [[WTA Tier II Events|tier II tournaments]]: [[Proximus Diamond Games|Antwerp]], [[2006 Dubai Tennis Championships|Dubai]] (beaten in final round by [[Kateryna Bondarenko]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/baltacha-back-in-the-groove-to-stand-on-the-brink-of-dubai-open-467198.html |title=Baltacha back in the groove to stand on the brink of Dubai Open |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/baltacha-battles-in-vain-467255.html |title=Baltacha battles in vain |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> and [[Qatar Total Open|Qatar]]. This was then followed by two first round losses in $25,000 ITF tournaments and a run to the semifinals of another. In May she again represented [[Great Britain Fed Cup team|Great Britain]] in the [[2006 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]] and again won all three of her singles matches. She beat: [[Hungary Fed Cup team|Hungarian]], [[Kyra Nagy]], [[Bulgaria Fed Cup team|Bulgaria's]] [[Dimana Krastevitch]] and [[Valeria Bondarenko]] from [[Ukraine Fed Cup team|Ukraine]]. In the Europe/Africa play-off however, she lost to [[Slovakia Fed Cup team|Slovakia's]], [[Magdal<U+00E9>na Ryb<U+00E1>rikov<U+00E1>]].

She underwent keyhole surgery on a [[prolapsed disc]] on the 7th June and spent the rest of the season out-of-action recovering<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/injury-to-djokovic-eases-path-for-nadal-481441.html |title=Injury to Djokovic eases path for Nadal |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> and as a result, her season-ending ranking was '''world No.347'''.<ref name='Activity'/>

===2007===
By the time Elena returned to action in March [[2007 WTA Tour|2007]] after surgery on a [[prolapsed disc]], her singles ranking had fallen to 660 in the world and as such, she had to qualify for her first $25,000 [[2007 ITF Women's Circuit|ITF]] tournament of the year in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. She successfully qualified before losing to [[Sorana Cirstea]], 3-6 6-3 6-7<sup>(1)</sup>, in the first round. She competed in two more $25,000 events in March (reaching the quarterfinals of one) before heading to [[Bulgaria]] to compete in the [[2007 Fed Cup|Fed Cup]] for [[Great Britain Fed Cup team|Britain]]. She played two singles matches (winning one) and four doubles matches (winning two). Following this she reached two consecutive $25,000 ITF semifinals in [[Incheon]] and [[Gimcheon]], one as a qualifier and the other as a [[Lucky loser (tennis)|lucky loser]]. She consolidated these results with a run to the quarterfinals of another $25,000 in [[Changwon]]. In June she received a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] into the main draw of the [[2007 DFS Classic|DFS Classic]] where she showed ''"fighting spirit"'' in her first round loss to [[Milagros Sequera]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/cavadays-shock-victory-lifts-the-gloom-for-britain-452862.html |title=Cavaday's shock victory lifts the gloom for Britain |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> She then received a wild card into the qualifying draw for the [[2007 Hastings Direct International Championships - Singles|Hastings Direct International]] and proved she deserved it by dropping only nine games in the three matches she won to successfully qualify. She then went on to beat the British No.1, [[Anne Keothavong]], in round one of the main draw in a tense three set match, 6-2 2-6 7-6<sup>(5)</sup>, and join fellow Brits, [[Melanie South]] and [[Katie O'Brien]] in the second round, making this the first year since 1991 that three British women reached the second round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/baltacha-survives-british-rollercoaster-to-earn-rapid-rise-453824.html |title=Baltacha survives British roller-coaster to earn rapid rise |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> She couldn't quite match up to world No.14, [[Nicole Vaidisova]], in the second round though; Elena was beaten, 3-6 2-6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/henman-rues-lapses-in-loss-to-tursunov-453973.html |title=Henman rues lapses in loss to Tursunov |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> She then received another wild card into the main draw of [[2007 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] but wasn't able to overcome the 19th seed, [[Katarina Srebotnik]], and lost 6-7<sup>(4)</sup> 6-3 2-6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/obrien-win-hints-at-new-dawn-for-british-women-454783.html |title=O'Brien win hints at new dawn for British women |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref>

After Wimbledon, Elena headed to the [[United States]] to compete again on the ITF circuit where she reached the quarterfinals of the $50,000 event in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. After being beaten in the first round of qualifying for the [[2007 US Open - Women's Singles|US Open]] by [[Evgeniya Rodina]] (2-6 4-6), Elena headed to Japan to attempt to qualify for the [[2007 AIG Japan Open Tennis Championships - Women's Singles|Japan Open]]. She beat [[Maria-Emilia Salerni]], [[Agnes Szatmari]] and [[Natalie Grandin]] to qualify and then continued winning by defeating [[Yan Zi]], 2-6 6-2 6-4, in the first round. She was defeated by No.5 seed and eventual champion, [[Virginie Razzano]], in round 2 with a score of 2-6 2-6. This was followed by an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for a [[WTA Tier III Events|tier III]] event in [[Bangkok]] and then a return to the ITF circuit where she reached the semifinals in [[Makinohara]] and the quarterfinals in [[Hamanako]] (both $25,000), losing both times to Japan's, [[Seiko Okamoto]]. Her final singles ranking of 2007 was '''world No.187'''.<ref name='Activity'/>

===2008===
Baltacha began her [[2008 WTA Tour|2008]] season by qualifying for the [[2008 ASB Classic - Singles|ASB Classic]], beating compatriot, [[Melanie South]], along the way. She faced two-time ASB Classic champion and No.7 seed, [[Eleni Danilidou]], in the opening round and was beaten decisively, 1-6 2-6. She then progressed to round two of the qualifying tournament for the [[2008 Australian Open - Women's Singles|Australian Open]] when her opponent, [[Virginie Pichet]], retired when down one set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/four-british-players-rise-above-heat-to-win-qualifying-matches-769486.html |title=Four British players rise above heat to win qualifying matches |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> She was beaten in the second round of qualifying by [[Zhang Shuai (tennis)|Zhang Shuai]], 4-6 1-6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/henmans-conqueror-tsonga-provides-first-obstacle-for-murray-769791.html |title=Henman's conqueror Tsonga provides first obstacle for Murray |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> In February she tried to qualify for [[2008 Qatar Total Open - Singles|Doha]] ([[WTA Tier I Events|tier I]]) and [[2008 Dubai Tennis Championships - Women's Singles|Dubai]] (WTA Tier II Events|tier II) but was unsuccessful in both. She then returned to action on the [[2008 ITF Women's Circuit|ITF circuit]] and won her next two consecutive tournaments: [[Jersey]] ($25,000) and [[Torhout]] ($75,000). In May she again lost in the first round of the qualifying tournament for the [[2008 French Open - Women's Singles|French Open]] and in June she again received a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] into the main draw of the [[2008 DFS Classic - Singles|DFS Classic]] where she was beaten in round one by [[Ekaterina Makarova]], 5-7 6-7<sup>(1)</sup>. Another wild card granted her entry into the qualifying rounds of the [[2008 International Women's Open - Singles|International Women's Open]] where she won her first match against [[Naomi Cavaday]] before retiring at one set down in her second match against [[Tsvetana Pironkova]]. She then played in the main draw of [[2008 Wimbledon Championships - Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] (again courtesy of a wild card) where she beat [[Angelique Kerber]], 6-3 2-6 7-5 in the first round.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/baltacha-draws-on-fighting-spirit-for-emotional-success-852909.html |title=Baltacha draws on fighting spirit for emotional success |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> She was defeated in the second round by China's eventual semifinalist, [[Zheng Jie]] in straight sets, 2-6 5-7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/baltacha-bows-out-to-face-uncertain-future-once-again-854210.html |title=Baltacha bows out to face uncertain future once again |publisher=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref>

Elena then lost three consecutive matches before defeating [[Anna Korzeniak]] and [[Carly Gullickson]] in the first two rounds of qualifying for the [[2008 US Open - Women's Singles|US Open]]. She fell just short of reaching the main draw when she lost to [[Julie Coin]], 5-7 6-2 6-7<sup>(4)</sup>, in the final round of qualifying. She played seven more higher-level ITF tournaments over the rest of the year and reached the quarterfinals in one of them: the $50,000 event in [[Ismaning]] where she lost to [[Julia Goerges]].<ref name='Activity'/>

===2009===
Elena's first tournament of 2009 was the [[ASB Classic]] where she lost to [[Ekaterina Dzehalevich]] from [[Belarus]] in the first round of qualifying, 6-0 6-3. She then headed to the [[Australian Open]] qualifying tournament as the No.19 seed where she beat [[Anastasija Sevastova]] (6-3 6-4), [[Carly Gullickson]] (5-7 6-0 6-0) and top seed [[Jelena Kostanic Tosic]] (6-1 6-3) to set up a first round clash with former world number 14 [[Anna-Lena Gr<U+00F6>nefeld]]. With [[Katie O'Brien]] also successfully qualifying and [[Anne Keothavong]] and [[Melanie South]] reaching the main draw on merit, this put a total of 4 British women in the main draw; the first time this had happened in a Grand Slam other than [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] since the [[1992 U.S. Open - Women's Singles|1992 U.S. Open]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7834952.stm |title=Baltacha & O'Brien into Open draw |publisher=www.news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/australianopen/4276980/British-pair-Elena-Baltacha-and-Katie-OBrien-qualify-for-Australian-Open.html |title=British pair Elena Baltacha and Katie O'Brien qualify for Australian Open |publisher=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> when [[Clare Wood]] qualified and joined [[Jo Durie]], [[Monique Javer]] and [[Sara Gomer]] in the main draw. Elena beat Gr<U+00F6>nefeld, 6-1 6-4, in the first round becoming the only one of the four British women to reach the second round (O'Brien, Keothavong and South were beaten by [[Monica Niculescu]], [[Anna Chakvetadze]] and [[Marion Bartoli]] respectively) and setting up a battle with former world No.1 and Grand Slam champion, [[Amelie Mauresmo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1123302/Brit-Baltacha-books-place-second-round-victory-German-Groenefeld.html |title=Brit Baltacha books place in second round with victory over German Groenefeld |publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk}}</ref> Despite winning the first set, Baltacha went on to lose the match 4-6 6-3 6-2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1126476/Heartache-Baltacha-fails-chances-Mauresmo.html |title=Heartache for beaten Baltacha as she fails to take her chances against Mauresmo |publisher=www.dailymail.co.uk}}</ref>

In April, Elena was the No.1 seed in the $75,000 ITF tournament in [[Monz<U+00F3>n]]. She beat [[Lenka Tvaroskova]] in the first round to give her the 200th singles victory of her career. In round two she beat compatriot [[Naomi Cavaday]] before falling in the quarterfinals to the sixth seed, former world No.4, [[Kimiko Date-Krumm]] in a close three-setter, 7-5 4-6 6-7<sup>(4)</sup>.
In late April, seeded number 2, Baltacha went on to reach the final of the $25,000 event in [[Changwon]], without losing a set in the whole tournement. She faced the No.6 seed [[Junri Namigata]] in the final and won, 6-3 6-1, to give her the sixth ITF singles title of her career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lta.org.uk/News/All-news-items/2009-04-20/Baltacha-wins-title-in-Korea/ |title=Baltacha wins title in Korea |publisher=www.lta.org.uk}}</ref>
