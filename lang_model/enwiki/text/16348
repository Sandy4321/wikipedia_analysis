[[Ragging]] is a verbal, physical or psychological abuse on newcomers to educational institutions. It is similar to the American phenomenon known as [[hazing]]. [[Sri Lanka]] is said to be its worst affected country in the world. <ref>[http://noragging.com/index.php/Research/Reports/Ragging-History-and-Evolution.html  Ragging: History and Evolution]</ref><ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/07/01/main_Letters.asp Stop murder by ragging!]</ref>

==History==

There is no record to prove such an act has prevailed in the ancient Sri Lankan educational institutions such as [[Mahavihara]] or [[Abhayagiri Vihara]]. It was in the post [[World War II]] era, a concept called ragging came into existence. Ragging is not an indigenous phenomenon, but a direct result of the [[British Ceylon|British colonialism]] in Sri Lanka. Soldiers returning from war re-entered the college and brought with them the technique of ragging learned in military camp. These techniques were used to make individual fail as an individual and succeed as a team. But eventually when lesser number of military persons entered the universities, ragging lost in primary objectives and became a violent and hazardous exercise.

==Present State==

Ragging is continued to happen in most government universities and several private institutions<ref>[http://www.tamilcanadian.com/page.php?cat=73&id=1550 Indiscipline in Sri Lanka universities]</ref>. In majority of the cases, ragging implies that seniors mocking and jesting at freshers. There is a certain period of time, usually the first few months in the university, assigned for each and every undergraduate to undergo ragging. This period is known as the ''ragging period''. It is. In Sri Lanka, several types of ragging can be observed<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/24/fea02.asp Ragging and <U+2018>teaching sessions<U+2019>]</ref>.

===Introduction===

Inception of ragging can be pleasant at first, hence the name ''Mal Samaya''. During this week or so, all newcomers are ordered to memorize the name and home town of their peers. The objective of this exercise is said to be increasing the friendship among batch mates (locally termed as ''batch fit''). 

===Dress Code Ragging===

The freshmen are asked to dress in a specific dress code for a particular period of time. For the dress code prescribed is generally weird, e.g. dressing totally in white or black with the hair oiled and combed in a particular style, dressing shirts that do not contain stripes, dressing long skirts for girls. The dress code ragging may make the freshmen feel awkward and uncomfortable as it often brings them unnecessary attention from everybody.

===Playing the Fool===

The freshmen may be asked to do silly things like climbing a tree, kissing a tree, proposing to someone from the opposite sex, holding a hand of someone from opposite sex and walking etc.

===Verbal Torture===

Verbal torture involves indulging in loose talks. The freshmen may be asked to sing the lyrics of any vulgar song or use abusive language in the presence of a large number of peers.  During this time, seniors assign an abusive and demeaning nick name, known as ''card'' to the juniors and they have to be called by that name throughout their entire university life. In some universities, this nick name is changed to a less vulgar name after the ragging period. These aliases are used primarily as a means of preventing the university authorities identifying the students who are involved in ragging and other unlawful activities. The form of verbal ragging differs from one institution to another. In some universities, students have to memorize poems comprising of filth and recite them in front of others.

===Physical Torture===

This is the severest form of ragging that could take place in an university. Some seniors are mainly interested in details such as the anatomical description of one<U+2019>s body parts, his or her sexual interests etc. In many cases, the freshmen have been asked to strip before the seniors. However, sexual abuse of female students remains rare. Outstation students who stay in hostels are most vulnerable to ragging. They may be asked to do odd acts such as having showers several times per day. This period of time is termed ''Bheeshana Samaya'' locally.

==Effects of Ragging==

Ragging has been frequently associated with a broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, emotional and social problems among the victims. It has independently increased suicide risks in Sri Lankan universities.  Each year, dozens of students leave their course due to unbearable ragging they undergo.  And a new tendency is emerging as students who complete their [[GCE Advanced Level in Sri Lanka|GCE Advanced Level]] examination enter private higher educational institutions where ragging remains minimum, without entering government universities<ref>[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/2/12522_image_headline.html Anti- Ragging Bill will be strengthen - Wishwa Warnapala]</ref>. It should be noted that ragging is not merely a socio-legal problem. It has a certain psychological basis too. Most of the senior students do not will to rag their juniors. But they also succumb to the peer pressure in the end.

==Politics in Ragging==

Since a long time ago, it was alleged that politics has taken control of the university students<U+2019> unions and thus has a direct influence on ragging<ref>[http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/EditorialReviews/erev200011/20001113editorialreview.html Violence among university students]</ref>. This has been proven by the fact that student leaders who are controlling the movements are becoming members of political parties just after they finished their course<ref>[http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/14294 The Fundamental Threat to Sri Lankan University Education]</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2009/11/091123_lanka_students.shtml JVP student leader admits war silence]</ref>.

==Major Incidents==

*In 1975, [[University of Peradeniya]] was the first University in Sri Lanka to report a major ragging related incident when a 22 year old student of the Faculty of Agriculture, ''Rupa Rathnaseeli'' became paralyzed as a result of having jumped from the second floor of the hostel ''Ramanathan'' to escape the physical ragging being carried out by the seniors. She later committed suicide in 1997<ref>[http://www.island.lk/2003/01/11//news01.html Rupa Rathnaseeli, forced to jump from the second floor of the<U+2019>Ramanathan<U+2019>]</ref>.
*In 1997, 21 year old S. Varapragash, an Engineering student of [[University of Peradeniya]], died from a kidney failure following severe ragging by senior students<ref>[http://noragnofear.com/index.html Death of S. Varapragash ]</ref>.
*A girl, also a first year student - in the [[University of Ruhuna]] committed suicide in 1997 as she was unable to bear ragging by her senior students<ref>[http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&artid=174 A student dies after ragging]</ref>.
*Kelum Thushara Wijetunge, a first year student at the Hardy Technical institute in Ampara, died in 1997, from a kidney failure after he was forced to do some tough exercises and drink excessive quantities of liquor as a part of ragging<ref>[http://www.sundaytimes.lk/980104/news2.html Kelum Thushara Wijetunge, asudent in Ampara dies from ragging]</ref>.
*In 2002, [[Samantha Vithanage]], a third year Management student at the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], pioneered an anti-ragging campaign was killed at a meeting while in a discussion about ragging<ref>[http://www.groundviews.org/2009/11/30/ragging-in-our-universities-a-symptom-or-a-disease/ Ragging in our universities: A symptom or a disease?]</ref><ref>[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/dec2002/jvp-d02.shtml JVP-inspired violence leads to crackdown on Sri Lanka campuses]</ref>.

==Legal Framework==

The human rights of citizens of Sri Lanka are protected in terms of the [[Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] which is the supreme law in the country. According to this Constitution, any citizen can produce a petition to the Supreme Court in terms of the article 126 of the Constitution in case of a human right violation or a case closer to the infringement. The Constitution further highlights ruthless, brutal or contemptuous treatment to any party by another as a violation of human rights<ref>[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/29/fea01.asp Legal framework on university ragging]</ref>. University students are also considered as citizens and are subjugated to the Common Law that prevails in the country. Accordingly, the constitutional constrains specified above are equally applicable to university students. Any form of civil or criminal offence executed by them are liable to be punished and in an instance of violation of such rights committed by university students, they shall be produced before the relevant Court and subject to suitable punishment that followed by the trial. After the series of ragging-related incidents happened in 1997, ''Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998''<ref>[http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/poraofovieia20o1998797/ Prohibition Of Ragging And Other Forms Of Violence In Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998]</ref> was passed in the Sri Lankan parliament. As specified in the detailed note of the Act, it is identified as an Act to eliminate ragging and other forms of violent and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment from educational institutions. The Act specifies the relevant Higher Educational Institutions coming under the Act and that includes all the Higher Educational Institutions established under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

==Anti-ragging movement==

Unlike in India, there is no official anti-ragging movement in Sri Lanka. But with the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is a self emerging a anti-ragging movement in each and every faculty of the university that ragging exists.  In the case of [[University of Peradeniya]], the largest university in Sri Lanka, anti-ragging movement has emerged in the year 1996. Prior to that, there was no movement against ragging, but certain individuals who escaped from the rag. In the mean time, anti-ragging movements started to appear in all other universities. Several faculties in several universities have become rag-free due to these movements, strengthened laws as well as practical difficulties in conducting ragging such as not providing accommodation facilities to the first year students.  Internal clashes have erupted several times due to the friction between ragging and anti-ragging movements, best example being [[Samantha Vithanage]], a third year Management student at the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], who pioneered an anti-ragging campaign was killed at a meeting while in a discussion about ragging. This year, Higher Education Minister Prof. [[W. A. Wiswa Warnapala|Wishwa Warnapala]] stressed the need for implementing regulations relating to the Anti-Ragging Bill, which was passed in Parliament several years back, due to the reason that, in the recent past the ragging in universities has increased to an unacceptable limit<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/09/09/news03.asp Minister Talks Tough]</ref>.
