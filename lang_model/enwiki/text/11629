He made his debut in 1993 with the single "[[What's It to You]]", which reached Number One on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts, as did its follow-up, 1994's "Live Until I Die".<ref name="allmusic"/> Both singles were included on Walker's self-titled debut album, also released in 1993.

To date, Walker has released a total of ten albums, including a Greatest Hits package and an album of Christmas music.

==Early Years==
Ernest Clayton Walker, Jr. was born on August 19, 1969 in the city of [[Beaumont, Texas]], also the hometown of country music artists [[George Jones]] and [[Mark Chesnutt]]. After his parents divorced, Clay lived with his father, who gave him a guitar when he was nine years old.<ref name="allmusic"/> At age sixteen, after leaving his shift as night-shift desk clerk at a [[Super 8 Motel]], Walker stopped at a local radio station to deliver a tape of a song that he had written himself. Although the morning [[disc jockey]] told him that the station's policies prohibited playing self-submitted tapes, he nonetheless played Clay's song, announcing that the song was "too good to pass up".<ref name="clay">{{cite web |url=http://claywalker.musiccitynetworks.com/index.htm?id=8743 |title=Clay Walker biography |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=Clay Walker official website}}</ref>

After graduating from Vidor High School in 1987, Walker went on to tour the state of [[Texas]], playing at various local clubs and eventually finding work as the house singer at a bar in Beaumont called the Neon Armadillo.<ref name="allmusic"/> There, Clay was discovered by [[James Stroud]], a record producer who helped him receive a record deal with [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]], a subsidiary label of [[Warner Music Group]].<ref name="allmusic"/>

==Musical career==
{{Expand-section|more info on each individual album; info on critical commentary, musical stylings|date=December 2007}}
Walker's debut album, the self-titled ''[[Clay Walker (album)|Clay Walker]]'', was released in 1993. Its first two singles, 1993's "What's It to You" and 1994's "Live Until I Die", both reached the top of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts,<ref name="allmusic"/> as did the fourth single, "Dreaming with My Eyes Open". The album was also certified platinum in the United States for selling more than one million copies, starting a pattern that would continue with Walker's next three albums.

===Mid-1990s===
''[[If I Could Make a Living]]'' was the title of Clay's second album, released in 1994.<ref name="allmusic"/> Overall, it produced two more Number One singles, the title track (co-written by [[Alan Jackson]]) and 1995's "[[This Woman and This Man]]", as well as a Top 20 hit in "My Heart Will Never Know".

1995 also saw the release of Walker's third studio album, titled ''[[Hypnotize the Moon]]''. Although none of its singles reached Number One, ''Hypnotize the Moon'' produced three consecutive Top Five hits: "Who Needs You Baby", followed by the album's title track and "Only on Days That End in <U+201C>Y<U+201D>".

In 1996, after recording the tracks to his fourth studio album, Clay was playing basketball with a friend, when he began to experience numbness, facial spasms, and double vision.<ref name="ms1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/site/PageServer?pagename=HOM_LIVE_clay_walker |title=Personal Connections to MS: Clay Walker |accessdate=2007-11-16 |work=National MS Society}}</ref><ref name="find1">{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0675/is_1_23/ai_n9474815 |title=Diagnosis: survivor living with multiple sclerosis, country music star Clay Walker has learned to put a positive spin on life |accessdate=2007-11-16 |last=Siegler |first=Bonnie |date=2005-01 |work=American Fitness}}</ref> An [[MRI]] revealed that the singer had [[multiple sclerosis]]. After a year of recovery, Clay released his fourth album, 1997's ''[[Rumor Has It (Clay Walker album)|Rumor Has It]]''. Its title track, which was the first single released, became his sixth and final Number One single that year. Other singles from the album included the Top 20 "One, Two, I Love You", and consecutive Top 5 hits "Watch This" and "Then What?".

===Late 1990s===
Walker's first compilation album, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Clay Walker album)|Greatest Hits]]'', was issued in 1998. Included on the album were two previously unreleased songs, both of which were released as singles. Of these, "Ordinary People" peaked at #35, while "You're Beginning to Get to Me" peaked at #2. ''Greatest Hits'' achieved a gold certification by the RIAA for selling 500,000 copies.

1999 saw the release of ''[[Live, Laugh, Love]]''. The album's first two singles, "My Heart Will Never Know" and the title track, were both Top 20 hits, while 2000's "[[The Chain of Love]]" reached a peak of #3. Although ''Live, Laugh, Love'' was also certified gold in the United States, its fourth single failed to reach Top 40.

===2000s===
In 2001, Warner Music Group merged Giant Records into its [[Warner Bros. Records]] division. The same year, Clay's ''[[Say No More]]'' album was released. Overall, itt only produced two minor chart entries, neither of which made Top 20. After ''[[Believe: A Christmas Collection]]'', a compilation of Christmas music released in 2002, Clay was dropped from Warner Bros.' roster.

A year later, he wrote and recorded a song for the [[National Football League]]'s newest expansion team at the time, the [[Houston Texans]]. Titled "Football Time in Houston", the song was used as the team's official fight song during their inaugural season; except for a temporary switch in the team's second season, the Texans have used "Football Time in Houston" as their fight song ever since.

===2003: Switch to RCA Records===
By 2003, Clay found a second record deal on [[RCA Records]]' Nashville division. His only album for the label, 2003's ''[[A Few Questions]]'', produced consecutive Top Ten singles in its title track and "[[I Can't Sleep (song)|I Can't Sleep]]", which Walker co-wrote with [[Chely Wright]]. "Jesus Was a Country Boy", the third single from ''A Few Questions'', peaked at #31 in late 2004; Clay was dropped from RCA soon afterward.

===''Fall''===
Walker was signed his third record deal in late 2006, this time with Asylum-Curb, a division of [[Curb Records]]. His first single for the label, "[['Fore She Was Mama]]", reached a peak of #21 in March of 2007. It was followed by the release of ''[[Fall (Clay Walker album)|Fall]]'', Walker's tenth album overall. Its title track was released to radio in April 2007; after more than thirty weeks on the ''Billboard'' country charts, "Fall" became Clay's first Top Five hit in seven years. Also included on ''Fall'' was a cover of [[Freddy Fender]]'s hit song "Before the Next Teardrop Falls".

==Charitable efforts==
In 1996, Clay was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), a disease which affects the [[central nervous system]]. Although originally told that he only had a few years to live,{{Fact|date=November 2007}} Walker has managed his MS through daily injections of [[Copaxone]].<ref name="singer">{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/03/29/Artsandentertainment/Walker__Texas_singer.shtml |title=Walker, Texas singer |accessdate=2007-11-16 |date=2004-03-09 |work=St. Petersburg Times}}</ref> He has also participated in several forms of charity to help fight MS; most notably, his own non-profit charity, Band Against MS.<ref name="ms1"/>

Walker also competed at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]] in the cutting competition with his horse, Maddie, and placed seventh.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} He regularly competes in the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am; in 2005, his team won the tournament, and Walker donated his share of the winnings to Band Against MS.<ref name="ms1"/>
