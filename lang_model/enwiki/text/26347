The most numerous  [[Britain|British]] manufactured tank of [[World War II]], the '''Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine''' was known mainly for its inexpensive cost and high reliability.

==History==
Based on the [[Cruiser Mk II|A10 Cruiser tank]], the Valentine was privately designed by the [[Vickers-Armstrong]] corporation (hence its lack of an "A" designation) and was submitted to the [[War Office]] in February [[1938]]. The development team tried to combine the weight of a cruiser tank (so that suspension and transmission parts of the A10 could be used) with the [[vehicle armour|armour]] of an infantry tank, which resulted in a very small vehicle with a cramped interior and two-man [[turret]]. Though its armour was still weaker than the [[Matilda tank|Matilda's]] and, due to a weaker engine, it shared the same top speed, the new design was much less expensive and easy to produce.

The War Office was initially deterred by the size of the turret and the crew compartment. However, concerned by the situation in Europe, it finally approved the design in April 1939. The vehicle reached trials in May 1940, which coincided with the loss of nearly all of Britain's equipment during the [[Operation Dynamo|evacuation at Dunkirk]]. The trials were successful and the vehicle was rushed into production as '''Infantry Tank III Valentine'''.

Several versions exist concerning the source of the name Valentine. The most popular one says that the design was presented to the War Office at [[St. Valentine's Day]] (February 14). Some sources, however, claim that the exact date the design was submitted was February 10. According to other version, the tank was called Valentine in honor of Sir John Valentine Carden, the man who led the development of the A10 and many other Vickers vehicles. Yet another version says that Valentine is an [[acronym]] for '''V'''ickers-'''A'''rmstrong '''L'''td [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|'''E'''lswick]] & [[Newcastle upon Tyne|'''N'''ewcastle-upon-'''Tyne''']].

The Valentine remained in production until April [[1944]], becoming Britain's most mass produced tank during the war with 6855 units manufactured in the UK (by Vickers, [[Metro Cammell|Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage and Wagon]] and [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company|Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon]]) and further 1420 in [[Canada]]. They were the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth's]] main export to the [[Soviet Union]] under the [[Lend-lease]] Act, with 2394 of the British models being sent and 1388 of the Canadian (the remaining 30 were kept for training).

==Combat history==
[[Image:British tanks and crews line up on Tripoli's waterfront.jpg|250px|right|thumb|British tanks and crews line up on Tripoli's waterfront after capturing the city, 1942.]]
The tank first saw combat during [[Operation Crusader]], at which point it began to replace the Matilda. It was extensively used in the [[North African Campaign]], earning reputation of reliable and well protected vehicle. However, the Valentine shared the common weakness of the British tanks of the period - its 2-pdr gun lacked high-explosive capability and soon became outdated as an anti-tank weapon too. The small size of the turret and of the turret ring made upgunning of the tank a difficult task. Although versions with the 6-pdr and then with the OQF 75 mm were developed, by the time they were available in significant numbers better tanks already reached the battlefield. Another weakness was small crew compartment and two-man turret. Larger turret with loader position added was used in some of the 2-pdr armed versions, but in the upgunned variants the position had to be removed again.

By 1944, in the [[European Theater of Operations]] the Valentine was almost competely replaced in the frontline units by the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] and the US-made [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]]. In the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific]] the tank was employed in limited numbers at least until May 1945.

In Soviet service, the Valentine was used from the [[Battle of Moscow]] until the end of the war. It was employed mostly on the southern fronts, both because of the proximity to the Persian supply route and in order to avoid using the tank in very cold climate. Although criticized for its speed and its weak gun, the Valentine was liked due to its small size, reliability and generally good armour protection.

==Variants==
<center>[[Image:Valentine tank hierarchy.png]]</center>

'''Valentine I (Infantry Tank Mk III)''' (350 units produced)<br />
The first model of the Valentine, it was not sent out due to problems from rushed production. The tank had riveted hull, was powered by [[AEC (Associated Equipment Company)|AEC]] A189 135 hp [[gasoline engine]] and equipped with a 2 pdr. gun and a [[Besa]] coaxial [[machine gun]]. Its two-man [[turret]] forced the commander to also act as the guns loader.

'''Valentine II (Infantry Tank Mk III*)''' (700)<br />
This model used AEC A190 131 hp [[diesel engine]]. In order to increase its range, an auxiliary external fuel tank was installed to the left of the engine compartment.

'''Valentine III'''<br />
A larger turret was installed, allowing the addition of a dedicated loader to ease the duties of the commander. The side armour was reduced from 60 mm to 50 mm to save weight.

'''Valentine IV'''<br />
A II using an [[United States|American]] 138 hp [[General Motors Corporation|GMC]] 6004 diesel engine and US-made transmission. Though it had slightly lower range, it was more silent and reliable.

'''Valentine V'''<br />
Valentine III with the GMC 6004 diesel engine and US-made transmission.

'''Valentine VI'''<br />
Canadian-built version of IV. It used some Canadian and American mechanical parts. Late production vehicles had cast [[glacis]] detail. First few produced with a [[Besa]] coaxial machinegun, but soon replaced with a [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|Browning 0.30 cal]] coaxial machinegun.

'''Valentine VII'''<br />
Another Canadian version, it was essetially VI with internal changes, and a different radio set.

'''Valentine VIIA'''<br />
VII with jettisonable fuel tanks, new studded tracks and protected headlights.

'''Valentine VIII'''<br />
A III upgraded with the [[QF 6 pdr|QF 6pdr]] gun. In order to fit it, the coaxial machinegun and the loader crewmember had to be removed. The side armour was reduced again.

'''Valentine IX'''<br />
[[Image:IWM-KID-893-Valentine.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Valentine IX.]]
A V upgraded to the 6 pdr. gun. Similar armour reduction as the VIII. On late production units an upgraded, 165 hp version of the GMC 6004 diesel was installed, somewhat improving mobility.

'''Valentine X'''<br />
A new turret design and 165 hp engine. A [[Besa]] coaxial machinegun was fitted again. Welded construction.

'''Valentine XI'''<br />
An X upgraded with the [[Ordnance QF 75 mm|OQF 75 mm]] gun and 210 hp version of the GMC 6004 diesel. Welded construction. Only served as a command tank.

'''Valentine DD'''<br />
Valentine Mk III and Mk VIII fitted with Straussler's [[Duplex Drive]]. Used by crews in training for the [[Sherman tank|Sherman]] DD's of the Normandy Landings.

'''Valentine OP / Command'''<br/>
Observation post / command version with dummy gun and extra radios.

'''Valentine CDL''' (Canal Defense Light).<br/>
Turret was replaced with searchlight.
[[Image:Valentine brueckenleger axb01.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Valentine Bridgelayer in [[Overloon War Museum]].]]
'''Valentine Scorpion II'''<br/>
Mine exploder, turretless with flail attachment. Never used operationally.

'''Valentine AMRA Mk Ib'''<br/>
Mine exploder with roller attachment. Never used operationally.

'''Valentine Snake'''<br/>
Mine exploder.

'''Valentine Bridgelayer'''<br/>
Turretless Mk II fitted with 34' x 9.5' class 30 scissors bridge. Several dozens were produced, some of them supplied to the USSR.

'''Valentine with 6pdr anti-tank mounting'''<br />
Experimental vehicle built by [[Vickers-Armstrong]] to examine possibility of producing a simple tank destroyer by mounting 6pdr field carriage on hull in place of turret. Trials only, 1942.

'''Valentine Flamethrowers'''<br/>
Two Valentine tanks were modified by Petroleum Warfare Dept to determine which system was best for a tank-mounted flame projector. One used a projector ignited by cordite charges and one used projector operated by gas pressure. The fuel was carried in a trailer and the flame projector was mounted on the hull front. Trials started in 1942 and it showed that gas-operated system was better. From this test installation was developed the Crocodile equipment for the [[Churchill tank|Churchill]] flamethrower used in the NW Europe campaign in 1944-45.

'''Valentine 7.92in flame mortar'''<br/>
Experimental vehicle with turret replaced by fixed heavy mortar intended to project 25 lb TNT incendiary shells to demolish concrete emplacements. Trials only by Petroleum Warfare Dept, 1943-45. Maximum range of this weapon was 2000 yards and effective range was 400 yards.
