'''John Albert Elway, Jr.''' (born June 28, 1960) is a former [[American football]] [[quarterback]] and is now the executive vice president of football operations for the [[Denver Broncos]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played [[college football]] at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] and his entire professional career with the Denver Broncos. Elway recorded the most victories by a starting quarterback at the time of his retirement. He retired in 1999 and statistically was the second most prolific passer in NFL history. Elway led his teams to six [[AFC Championship Game]]s and five [[Super Bowls]], winning his last two. 

Elway set several career records for passing attempts and completions while at Stanford. He also received [[All-America]]n honors. Elway was drafted #1 overall in the [[1983 NFL Draft]] by the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]] before being traded to the Denver Broncos. In 1987, he embarked on what is considered to be one of the most [[Clutch (sports)|clutch]] and iconic performances in sports and in NFL history, helping engineer the Broncos on a 98-yard, game-tying touchdown drive in the [[AFC Championship Game]] against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. The moment is known in [[National Football League lore]] as ''"[[The Drive]]"''. Following the AFC Championship Game, Elway and the Broncos lost in [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[New York Giants]]. It would be the first of a record five Super Bowl starts at quarterback in Elway's career, a record that he solely held until 2012 when [[Tom Brady]] earned his fifth Super Bowl start.

After two more Super Bowl losses, the Broncos entered a period of decline; however, that would end during the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997 season]], as Elway and Denver won their first Super Bowl title by defeating the [[Green Bay Packers]] 31<U+2013>24 in [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. The Broncos repeated as champions the following season in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] by defeating the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 34<U+2013>19. Elway was voted MVP of that Super Bowl, which would prove to be the last game of his career.

Elway was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004 in his first year of eligibility. Since his retirement, Elway has owned several businesses, including being a co-owner of the inactive [[Colorado Crush]], an [[arena football]] team.

==Early life==
Elway and his twin sister were born in [[Port Angeles, Washington]], on June 28, 1960, to Janet ([[n<U+00E9>e]] Jordan) and [[Jack Elway]], then a high school head coach at [http://www.portangelesschools.org/pahs/index.html Port Angeles High School] on the [[Olympic Peninsula]]. The following year, the family of five which included sister Lee Ann, a year older than the twins, moved to southwestern Washington where Jack was the [[junior college]] [[American football|football]] coach at [[Grays Harbor Community College]] in [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]] for five seasons. As a youth he lived primarily in [[Missoula, Montana]], and [[Pullman, Washington]], when his father was an assistant coach at [[Montana Grizzlies football|Montana]] and [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]], respectively.

His father became the [[head coach]] at [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State-Northridge]] in March [[1976 college football season|1976]], and the Elways moved from Pullman to the [[San Fernando Valley]] in [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]], where John played his final three years of [[high school football|football]] at [[Granada Hills High School]] in [[Granada Hills, California|Granada Hills]]. He ended his high school career with 5,711 passing yards and 49 passing touchdowns, and was named to the ''[[Parade (magazine)|PARADE]]'' All America High School Football Team. Known as a dual-threat quarterback, meaning he was accomplished at running and escaping pressure and had impressive passing ability, he was the number-one recruited high school player in the country, receiving over 60 [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} (One of those offers was from his father, who became the head coach at [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]] following the 1978 season.) Also an accomplished [[baseball]] player, Elway was selected by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the 18<sup>th</sup> round of the [[1979 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/index.cgi?draft_round=18&year_ID=1979&draft_type=junreg&query_type=year_round|title=18th Round of the 1979 MLB June Amateur Draft  |publisher=baseballreference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> (The Royals drafted [[Dan Marino]] in the fourth round of the same draft.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/index.cgi?draft_round=4&year_ID=1979&draft_type=junreg&query_type=year_round | title=4th Round of the 1979 MLB June Amateur Draft | publisher=baseballreference.com | date= | accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>)

==College career==
He enrolled at [[Stanford University]] in 1979 where he played football and [[baseball]]. In his senior season in 1982, Stanford was 5-5 and needed to win their final game, the [[Big Game (American football)|Big Game]] against [[University of California, Berkeley|California]], to secure an invitation to the [[Hall of Fame Classic]] [[bowl game]]. With two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was down 19-17 and they were on 4th-and-17 on their own 13-yard line. Elway completed a 29-yard pass and drove the ball downfield to the 35-yard line, where Mark Harmon kicked what appeared to be the winning field goal. However, the clock had four seconds remaining, so Stanford had to kick off. What followed is now simply known as "[[The Play]]", in which Cal players lateraled the ball, [[Rugby football|rugby]]-style, five times <U+2013>; two of them controversial <U+2013>; and scored a touchdown to win the game, 25-20. Elway was bitter about the game afterward, stating that the officials "ruined my last game as a college football player."<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-11-18/entertainment/17270265_1_ham-stanford-s-elway-assistants|title=Stanford's Elway bitter after Big Game loss to Cal in 1982|date=November 18, 2007|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|last=Miller|first=Johnny}}</ref> Stanford athletics director Andy Geiger said the loss cost Elway the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Twenty years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, saying that "each year it gets a little funnier."<ref name="alumni">{{cite journal|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2002/novdec/features/theplay.html|title=And The Band Played On|last=Krentzman|first=Jackie|publisher=Stanford Alumni Magazine|date=Nov/Dec 2002}}</ref>

Although Elway never led his team to a [[bowl game]], he had an accomplished college career. In his four seasons (1979<U+2013>1982) at Stanford, he completed 774 passes for 9,349 yards and 77 touchdowns. Stanford had a 20<U+2013>23 record during his tenure. Elway's 24 touchdown passes in 1982 led the nation, and he graduated with nearly every Stanford and [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pacific-10]] career record for passing and total offense. He won [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] Player of the Year honors in 1980 and 1982, was a consensus [[All-America]]n, and finished second in [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting as a senior.<ref>Elway finished second to [[Herschel Walker]], [http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/awards/heisman-1982.html Sports-Reference.com: 1982 Heisman Trophy Voting]</ref> In 2000, Elway was enshrined in the [[College Football Hall of Fame]]. In 2007, Elway was ranked #15 on ESPN's Top 25 Players In College Football History list. Thomas Davids, an assistant football coach, said that Elway was the "best looking ball player he had ever seen."{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A consensus All-American at Stanford,he passed for over 200 yards in 30 of his 42 collegiate games. Elway was the nations most highly recruited prep athlete in 1984.

Elway also excelled as a baseball player. He was drafted by the [[New York Yankees]] in the second round of the [[1981 MLB Draft]] (52nd overall, six spots ahead of future Hall of Famer [[Tony Gwynn]]), and received $150,000 for playing for the Yankees' [[short season]] affiliate [[Oneonta Tigers]] in the summer of 1982. Yankees scout [[Gary Hughes (baseball)|Gary Hughes]] believed that had Elway concentrated on baseball "the sky was the limit ... he would've been off the charts". Yankees owner [[George Steinbrenner]]&mdash;who aggressively sought Elway's services&mdash;reportedly planned to make him the Yankees' starting [[right fielder]] by {{mlby|1985}}, which Elway&mdash;aware of Steinbrenner's opinion&mdash;later described as "a tremendous [and] exciting thought".<ref name="30for30">{{cite episode | title=Elway to Marino | series=30 for 30 | network=ESPN | airdate=2013-04-23 | season=2}}</ref> He played right field and pitched for Stanford, finishing his senior year hitting .361 with nine home runs and 50 RBIs in 49 games and a 5<U+2013>4 record with a 4.51 ERA.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Elway graduated with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]], and he is a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] Fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Delta Tau Delta: Beta Rho Chapter - Stanford University|url=http://web.me.com/alexoppenheimer/Delta_Tau_Delta/Members.html|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref> Already age 19 when he entered as a freshman, Elway did not use a [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] year at Stanford.

==Professional career==

===1983 NFL Draft===
In the [[1983 NFL Draft]] Elway was selected as the first overall pick by the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]]. (He is one of three quarterbacks in the history of the draft to be chosen first and later be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The other two are [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Troy Aikman]].<ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/draft/draft_query.cgi?year_1=1936&year_2=2008&tm=all&pos=QB&round_1=1&round_2=1&slot_1=1&slot_2=1&conference=any&show=all&lg=ANY&type= "Customizable draft querier"], Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref>) Elway was wary of playing for the Colts, then among the worst teams in the league, and his father advised him against playing for head coach [[Frank Kush]], who had a reputation as a harsh taskmaster. While Elway preferred football his agent Marvin Demoff later stated that baseball was "a true option" for him at the time. More importantly, the possibility gave Elway leverage in negotiations with the Colts.{{r|30for30}}

After unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate an private agreement with the Colts in which Elway would cite his alleged desire to remain on the West coast to explain the team trading him, Elway publicly threatened to join the Yankees full-time if the Colts did not trade him; Demoff wrote in his journal, published three decades later, that "he would be a garbage collector before he'd play for Baltimore." Elway's refusal to join the Colts was controversial&mdash; Bradshaw denounced him, stating "you should play baseball ... he's not the kind of guy you win championships with"&mdash;but many other NFL teams began negotiations with the Colts for the quarterback. One possibility was trading Elway for the [[San Francisco 49ers]]' [[Joe Montana]], whose team had had a poor 1982 season. Another was a trade with the [[San Diego Chargers]], which was negotiating a new contract with its star quarterback [[Dan Fouts]]. The [[New England Patriots]] were interested, but the Colts did not wish to trade Elway to a team in the same division.{{r|30for30}}

The Colts' general manager [[Ernie Accorsi]] badly wanted Elway as, Accorsi later said, he (correctly) did not foresee the [[1984 NFL Draft|1984 draft]] as producing any first-round quarterbacks, and announced Elway as the team's choice as soon as possible during the 15-minute window on draft day, surprising observers. Elway that day reiterated his wish to not play for the Colts at a press conference, saying "As I stand here right now, I'm playing baseball". (When a reporter pointed out that the Yankees were not based on the West coast, Elway replied "They play baseball during the summertime".) The Colts, however, were interested in offensive lineman [[Chris Hinton]], which the [[Denver Broncos]] had chosen as the fourth pick in the first round. On 2 May Colts owner [[Robert Irsay]] and Accorsi agreed to trade Elway for Hinton, backup quarterback [[Mark Herrmann]], and a first-round pick in the [[1984 NFL Draft|1984 draft]].{{r|30for30}}

===Denver Broncos===
Elway joined Denver as one of the most highly anticipated athletes in the history of the NFL. The local newspapers ran a section that was called "The Elway Watch".<ref>{{cite news |author=Looney, Douglas S. |title=In Denver, Delirium Is Spelled E-l-w-a-y |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121123/index.htm |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=August 15, 1983 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> Elway debuted for the Broncos in the 1983 season opener against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. He was sacked for the first time in his NFL career at the hands of [[linebacker]] and fellow [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. Although the Broncos were playoff contenders for his early years, Elway went through the normal growing pains of a young NFL quarterback.

In the 1986 season, Elway led the Broncos to [[Super Bowl XXI]], after defeating the [[Cleveland Browns]] on a famous possession at the end of the fourth quarter that became known as "[[The Drive]]". (In a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, Elway led his team 98 yards to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. The Broncos went on to win the game in overtime). Elway and the Broncos started out the Super Bowl against the [[New York Giants]] very well, building a 10&ndash;7 lead and then driving to the Giants 1-yard line in the second quarter. However, the Broncos lost five yards on their next three plays and came up empty after kicker [[Rich Karlis]] missed the field goal attempt. From that point on, the rest of the game went downhill for the Broncos. Elway was sacked in the end zone for a safety on the Broncos ensuing possession, cutting their lead to 10<U+2013>9. Then in the second half, the Giants scored 30 points and ended up winning the game 39<U+2013>20. Still, Elway had an impressive performance, throwing for 304 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, while also leading Denver in rushing with 27 yards and a touchdown on the ground.

In 1987, Elway was selected to start in the [[American Football Conference]]'s (AFC) [[Pro Bowl]] team and won the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]]. He went on to once again lead the Broncos to a victory over the Browns in the AFC title game, earning their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, this one against the [[Washington Redskins]]. The game started out very well for Denver, and they built up a 10<U+2013>0 lead by the end of the first quarter. At the time, no team had ever overcome a 10<U+2013>0 deficit in the Super Bowl. But in the second quarter, the Redskins suddenly stormed back with a record 35 points, and ended up winning [[Super Bowl XXII]] 42<U+2013>10. Elway did have a few highlights. His 56-yard touchdown pass to [[Ricky Nattiel]] after just 1:57 had elapsed in the game set a record for the fastest touchdown in Super Bowl history, at the time. He also became the first quarterback ever to catch a pass in the Super Bowl, recording a 23-yard reception from halfback [[Steve Sewell]] on a [[halfback option play]]. With a porous defense unable to stop the Redskins offense, Elway was forced to take more risks on the offensive end. As a result, Elway's performance was rather disappointing: just 14 out of 38 completions for 257 yards and one touchdown, with three interceptions.

After recording an 8<U+2013>8 record in 1988, Elway once again led his team to the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Super Bowl XXIV]]. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55<U+2013>10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try to hide from the media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if he wanted to go back to the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.

It took Elway another eight years, but he eventually led his team back to the Super Bowl in 1998. During the 1997 preseason [[American Bowl]] game in Mexico City, Elway ruptured his right (throwing arm) [[biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] [[tendon]]. It was treated non-surgically, and he returned to play 19 days later, going on that season to play in his fourth [[Super Bowl]]. In [[Super Bowl XXXII]], the Broncos faced the defending Super Bowl champions [[Green Bay Packers]]. Despite Elway completing only 11 of 22 passes, throwing no TDs, but one interception, they went on to defeat the Packers 31<U+2013>24, finally winning a Super Bowl after three failed attempts for Elway (and four for the team). In 1999, the Broncos repeated this feat and Elway was awarded the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], throwing for 336 yards and one touchdown with one interception, while also scoring a rushing touchdown in Denver's 34<U+2013>19 win over the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. It was his last game, other than the [[1999 Pro Bowl]].

===Legacy===

On May 2, 1999, at the age of 38, Elway announced his retirement from pro football. Elway is regarded as one of the top quarterbacks ever to play the game. He has one of the best winning percentages in league history (148<U+2013>82<U+2013>1), and is tied for second most [[Pro Bowl]] selections for a quarterback (nine). He is fourth to [[Brett Favre]], [[Dan Marino]] and [[Peyton Manning]] in career passing attempts, passing yards and completions. His four total rushing touchdowns in his Super Bowl games are the most ever by a quarterback. As of 2012, Elway and [[Tom Brady]] are the only quarterbacks to start in 5 Super Bowls. He is also the second player ever to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (running back [[Thurman Thomas]] was the first). 

On September 13, 1999, Elway's number 7 jersey was retired by the [[Denver Broncos]] during halftime of a [[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]] game against the [[Miami Dolphins]]; that same night he was inducted into the Denver Broncos Ring of Fame. ([[Craig Morton]], his direct predecessor in Denver, also wore number 7 and is in the Ring of Fame alongside Elway). He was the first Broncos player to have the five-year waiting period waived. Also in 1999 he was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame.

Also in 1999, Elway was ranked number 16 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players,<ref>{{cite web|title=Football's 100 Greatest Players|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]|accessdate=September 22, 2009|url=http://archive.sportingnews.com/nfl/100/list-complete.html}}</ref> the only player to have spent the majority of his career with the Broncos to make the list ([[Willie Brown (football player)|Willie Brown]], who began his career with the Broncos but spent more of it with the [[Oakland Raiders]], also made the list). In 2005, ''TSN'' published another special feature honoring the 50 Greatest Quarterbacks. Elway was ranked third behind [[Johnny Unitas]] and [[Joe Montana]].

Elway was named the greatest athlete wearing the #7 by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. Current [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]' quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]], who grew up idolizing Elway and Joe Montana, wears number 7 in honor of Elway.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/22/AR2006012201255.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Big Ben, Already Like Clockwork | first=Michael | last=Wilbon | date=January 23, 2006 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> 

Elway is the oldest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, winning his last at the age of 38.

===Notable statistics===
Elway ended his career with a record 148 victories, since surpassed by [[Brett Favre]] for [[most wins by a starting quarterback (NFL)|most wins by a starting quarterback]]. He finished his career with 774 rushing attempts, one shy of NFL record-holder [[Randall Cunningham]] (775) for rushes by a quarterback. Elway's 3,417 rushing yards ranks sixth all-time among NFL QB's behind Cunningham, [[Michael Vick]], [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]], [[Fran Tarkenton]], and [[Steve McNair]].

Elway threw for 1,128 yards in his five Super Bowls, fourth most behind [[Tom Brady]], [[Kurt Warner]] and [[Joe Montana]]. His 76 Super Bowl pass completions rank fifth, and his 152 attempts were a Super Bowl record before being broken by [[Tom Brady]]. He is one of only two players ever to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being [[Thurman Thomas]]) and the only quarterback to do so. (156 attempts) <ref>[http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/records/superbowls/player/passing "Super Bowl Records: Individual Passing"], NFL.com</ref><ref>[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/leaders.htm "Super Bowl Leaders"], Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref>
