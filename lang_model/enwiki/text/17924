Avascular necrosis deprives the bone of blood, and without blood the bone dies and begins to be reabsorbed (lost).  As subchondral bone is lost, the articular cartilage above it becomes separated from the bone and prone to damage.  The result is fragmentation ([[dissection]]) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these [[Wiktionary:osteocartilaginous|osteochondral]] fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage.<ref name="pmid7273527">{{cite journal|author=Pappas AM|title=Osteochondrosis dissecans|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=158|pages=59<U+2013>69|year=1981|pmid=7273527}}</ref><ref name="pmid1157398">{{cite journal|author=Woodward AH, Bianco AJ|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=110|pages=35<U+2013>41|year=1975|pmid=1157398}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pettrone|first=FA|year=1986|title=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Symposium on Upper Extremity Injuries in Athletes|location=St. Louis, MO|publisher=CV Mosby|isbn=978-0801600265|pages=193<U+2013>232}}</ref>

In humans OCD is a [[rare disease]], occurring in only 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year.<ref name="pmid9012566"/> Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active [[adolescent]]s. Fortunately, because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD.  Recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases.

OCD usually causes pain and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the affected joint, catching and locking upon movement and a restriction in the [[range of motion]]. [[Physical examination]] typically reveals an [[effusion]], tenderness, and [[crepitus]]. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by [[Radiography|X-rays]], [[Computed tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scans. OCD is classified by these imaging techniques, or by [[arthroscopy]] of the joint, and represented in stages (I, II, III and IV) of disease progression. Following diagnosis the problem may be treated, depending on its severity, by [[articular cartilage repair|repairing the cartilage]].<ref name="pmid3886172">{{cite journal|author=Cahill B|title=Treatment of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans and osteochondritis dissecans of the knee|journal=Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=4|issue=2|pages=367<U+2013>84|year=1985|month=April|pmid=3886172}}</ref><ref name="pmid9397273">{{cite journal|author=Anderson AF, Pagnani MJ|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles. Long-term results of excision of the fragment|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=25|issue=6|pages=830<U+2013>4|year=1997|pmid=9397273}}</ref> Non-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the capacity for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing) and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment varies widely and includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, [[Stem cell transplantation for articular cartilage repair|stem cell transplantation]], and joint replacement. 

Post-operative rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of [[Lying (position)|immobilization]] and [[physical therapy]]. Most rehabilitation programs combine protection of the joint's cartilage surface and underlying subchondral bone with maintenance of muscle strength and range of motion. During the immobilization period, [[isometric exercise]]s, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle lost to [[atrophy]] without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. Post-operative [[analgesics|pain killers]], namely a mix of [[opioids]] and [[NSAIDs]], are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling during recovery.<!--this sentence needs work; strictly speaking, pain killers do not control inflammation and swelling-->

[[Franz K<U+00F6>nig (surgeon)|Franz K<U+00F6>nig]] coined the term in 1887, describing it as an [[inflammation]] of the bone<U+2013>[[cartilage]] interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, [[osteonecrosis]], accessory ossification center, [[osteochondrosis]], and hereditary epiphyseal [[dysplasia]]. Some authors have used the terms ''osteochondrosis dissecans'' and ''osteochondral fragments'' as [[synonym]]s for OCD. It has been studied in other species of animals<U+2014>mainly dogs, especially the [[German Shepherd Dog|German Shepherd]]<U+2014>in which this problem also occurs.<ref name="Ch.84OCD"/>

==Signs and symptoms==
In Osteochondritis dissecans, fragments of [[cartilage]] or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and [[inflammation]]. These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice.<ref name="pmid10643956-patient information handout">{{cite journal|author=Hixon AL, Gibbs LM|title=What Should I Know About Osteochondritis Dissecans?|journal=American Family Physician|volume=61|issue=1|pages=158|year=2000|month=January|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000101/20000101d.html}}</ref> OCD is a type of [[osteochondrosis]] in which a [[lesion]] has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.<ref name="pmid6807595"/>

People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, and giving way; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement.<ref name="pmid10643956">{{cite journal|author=Hixon AL, Gibbs LM|title=Osteochondritis dissecans: a diagnosis not to miss|journal=American Family Physician|volume=61|issue=1|pages=151<U+2013>6, 158|year=2000|month=January|pmid=10643956|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000101/151.html}}</ref> Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage&nbsp;I; however, the onset of stage&nbsp;II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage&nbsp;II, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as [[sprain]]s and [[strain (injury)|strains]], can delay a definitive diagnosis.<ref name="urlOCDofKNEE">{{cite web|url=http://www.eorthopod.com/public/files/Osteochondritis_Dissecans_of_the_Knee.pdf|title=Adolescent Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee|accessdate=2008-09-21|first=Matt<!--lastname missing-->|format=PDF|publisher=Medical Multimedia Group, LLC}}</ref>

Physical examination typically reveals an [[wiktionary: effusion|effusion]], tenderness, and [[crepitus]]. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty [[hemarthrosis]]. Although there is no significant [[pathologic]] gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid [[tibia]]l spine impingement on the [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] aspect of the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial condyle of the femur]].<ref name="pmid8613454">{{cite journal|author=Schenck RC Jr, Goodnight JM|title=Osteochondritis dissecans |journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American)|volume=78|issue=3|pages=439<U+2013>56|year=1996|month=March|pmid=8613454|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/content/full/78/3/439}}</ref>

==Causes==

Despite much research, the [[etiology|cause]]s remain unclear but include repetitive [[physical trauma]], [[ischemia]] (restriction of blood flow), [[hereditary]] and [[endocrine]] factors, [[avascular necrosis]] (loss of blood flow), rapid growth, deficiencies and imbalances in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus, and [[anomalies]] of [[ossification|bone formation]].<ref name="pmid2206181">{{cite journal|author=Federico DJ, Lynch JK, Jokl P|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: a historical review of etiology and treatment|journal=Arthroscopy|volume=6|issue=3|pages=190<U+2013>7|year=1990 |pmid=2206181}}</ref><ref name="pmid10513356">{{cite journal|author=Hefti F, Beguiristain J, Krauspe R, M<U+00F6>ller-Madsen B, Riccio V, Tschauner C, Wetzel R, Zeller R|title=Osteochondritis dissecans: a multicenter study of the European Pediatric Orthopedic Society|journal=Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics B|volume=8|issue=4|pages=231<U+2013>45|year=1999|month=October|pmid=2206181}}</ref><ref name="pmid4996078">{{cite journal|author=Langer F, Percy EC|title=Osteochondritis dissecans and anomalous centres of ossification: a review of 80 lesions in 61 patients|journal=Canadian Journal of Surgery|volume=14|issue=3|pages=208<U+2013>15|year=1971|month=May|pmid=4996078}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Geor|first=RJ|coauthors=Kobluk CN, Ames TR|year=1995|title=The Horse: Diseases and Clinical Management|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=W.B.

==Pathophysiology==
[[Image:Osteochondritis dissecans diagram.JPEG|thumb|left|Tunnel or notch view X-ray of the right knee from a patient with Osteochondritis dissecans<U+2014>note the cystic changes and irregular border (indicated by arrows) on the [[Anatomical terms of location|medial]] side compared to the [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] side]]
Osteochondritis dissecans differs from "wear and tear" degenerative [[osteoarthritis|arthritis]], which is primarily an articular surface problem. Instead, OCD is a problem of the underlying [[Wiktionary:subchondral|subchondral]] bone, which may secondarily affect the articular cartilage. Left untreated, OCD can lead to the development of degenerative arthritis secondary to joint incongruity and abnormal wear patterns.<ref name="pmid18500061">{{cite journal|author=Detterline AJ, Goldstein JL, Rue JP, Bach BR Jr|title=Evaluation and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee.|journal=Journal of Knee Surgery|volume=21|issue=2|pages=106<U+2013>15|year=2008|pmid=18500061}}</ref>

OCD occurs when a loose piece of bone or cartilage partially (or fully) separates from the end of the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply ([[osteonecrosis]]) and decalcification of the [[Trabecular bone|trabecular bone matrix]]. The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the [[joint]] stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees,<ref name="pmid6807595">{{cite journal|author=Clanton TO, DeLee JC |title=Osteochondritis dissecans. History, pathophysiology and current treatment concepts|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=167 |pages=50<U+2013>64|year=1982|month=July|pmid=6807595}}</ref> ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.<ref name="pmid17980849">{{cite journal|author=Kadakia AP, Sarkar J|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the talus involving the subtalar joint: a case report|journal=Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery|volume=46|issue=6|pages=488<U+2013>92|year=2007|pmid=17980849|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

In skeletally immature individuals, the blood supply to the [[epiphyseal plate|epiphyseal bone]] is good, supporting both [[osteogenesis]] and [[chondrogenesis]]. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of [[necrosis]] occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both [[osteocytes]] and [[chondrocytes]]. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral [[avascular necrosis]] and consequently OCD.<ref name="topic57webmd"> {{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/sports/TOPIC57.HTM|title=Knee Osteochondritis Dissecans|accessdate=2008-10-02|author=Jacobs B, Ertl JP, Kovacs G, Jacobs JA|work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape }}</ref>

Four minor stages of OCD have been identified after trauma. These include [[revascularization]] and formation of granulation (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive  [[arthritis|arthritic]] deterioration.<ref name="topic57webmd"/>

To diagnose Osteochondritis dissecans, an [[X-ray]], [[CT scan]] or [[MRI scan]] can be performed to show necrosis of subchondral bone and/or formation of loose fragments.<ref name="pmid12591666">{{cite journal|author=Boutin RD, Januario JA, Newberg AH, Gundry CR, Newman JS|title=MR imaging features of osteochondritis dissecans of the femoral sulcus|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=180|issue=3|pages=641<U+2013>5|year=2003|month=March|pmid=12591666|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/180/3/641.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Occasionally a [[nuclear medicine]] [[bone scan]] is used to assess the degree of loosening within the joint.<ref name="Mesgarzadeh">{{cite journal|author=Mesgarzadeh M, Sapega AA, Bonakdarpour A, Revesz G, Moyer RA, Maurer AH, Alburger PD|title=Osteochondritis dissecans: analysis of mechanical stability with radiography, scintigraphy, and MR imaging|journal=Radiology|volume=165|issue=3|pages=775<U+2013>80|year=1987|month=December|pmid=3685359|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/reprint/165/3/775}}</ref>

===Physical examination===
Physical examination often begins with examination of the patient's [[Gait (human)|gait]]. In OCD of the knee, people may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid [[tibia]]l spine impingement on the [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] aspect of the [[Medial condyle of femur|medial condyle of the femur]].<ref name="pmid8613454"/>

Next, the examining physician may check for weakness of the [[quadriceps]]. This examination may reveal an [[wiktionary: effusion|effusion]], tenderness, and crepitus. The [[Wilson test]] is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the [[Lower extremity of femur|femoral condyle]].<ref name="pmid6022357">{{cite journal|author=Wilson JN|title=A diagnostic sign in osteochondritis dissecans of the knee|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American)|volume=49|issue=3|pages=477<U+2013>80|year=1967|month=April|pmid=6022357|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/49/3/477.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of [[flexion]] and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.<ref name="pmid12975201">{{cite journal|author=Conrad JM, Stanitski CL|title=Osteochondritis dissecans: Wilson's sign revisited|journal=Am J Sports Med|volume=31|issue=5 |pages=777<U+2013>8|year=2003|pmid=12975201|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>

Physical examination of a patient with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, [[crepitus]], and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching and/or locking.<ref name="cooperwebmd"/>The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are [[extrinsic]] and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.<ref name="OCDPatella-IO">{{cite journal|author=Livesley PJ, Milligan GF|year=2004|month=November|day=29|title=Osteochondritis dissecans patellae|journal=International Orthopaedics|volume=16|issue=2|pages=126<U+2013>129|publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg|location= |issn=0341-2695|accessdate=2009-02-16}}</ref>

===Diagnostic imaging===
X-rays show lucency of the [[ossification]] front in juveniles. In older people, the lesion typically appears as an area of [[Osteosclerosis|osteosclerotic]] bone with a [[radiolucent]] line between the osteochondral defect and the [[epiphysis]]. The visibility of the lesion depends on its location and on the amount of knee [[flexion]] used. Harding described the lateral X-ray as a method to identify the most common site of an OCD lesion.<!--identify the most common site? does not make sense--><ref name="pmid852179">{{cite journal|author=Harding WG 3rd.|title=Diagnosis of ostechondritis dissecans of the femoral condyles: the value of the lateral x-ray view|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|volume=123|pages=25<U+2013>6|year=1977|month=March<U+2013>April|pmid=852179}}</ref>

[[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is useful for staging OCD lesions, evaluating the integrity of the joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants<!--variants of what?--> from OCD by showing bone and cartilage [[edema]] in the area of the irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the [[wikt:Articular Cartilage|articular cartilage]] and underlying [[Wiktionary:subchondral|subchondral]] bone, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, [[Articular cartilage damage|articular]] surface integrity, and fragment displacement.<ref name="pmid2117355">{{cite journal|author=De Smet AA, Fisher DR, Graf BK, Lange RH|title=Characterizing osteochondral lesions by magnetic resonance imaging|journal=Arthoscopy|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101<U+2013>4|year=1991|pmid=2117355|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/reprint/155/3/549.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="pmid2009106">{{cite journal|author=Dipaola JD, Nelson DW, Colville MR|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: value of MR imaging in determining lesion stability and the presence of articular cartilage defects|journal=American Journal of Roentgenology|volume=155|issue=2|pages=549<U+2013>53|year=1990|month=September|pmid=2009106}}</ref> A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions.

[[Computed tomography|CT]] (computed tomography) scans and [[Technetium-99m]] [[bone scan]]s are also sometimes used to monitor the progress of treatment.

OCD is classified by the progression of the disease in stages. 
There are two main staging classifications used; one is determined by MRI diagnostic imaging while the other is determined [[Arthroscope|arthroscopically]]. However, both stagings represent the pathological conditions associated with OCD's natural progression.<ref name="pmid10643956"/> 

While the arthroscopic classification of [[Wiktionary:osteocartilaginous|osteochondral]] lesions is considered standard, the Anderson MRI staging is the main form of staging used in this article.<ref name="pmid10887249">{{cite journal|author=Takahara M, Ogino T, Takagi M, Tsuchida H, Orui H, Nambu T|title=Natural progression of osteochondritis dissecans of the humeral capitellum: initial observations|journal=Radiology|volume=216|issue=1 |pages=207<U+2013>12|year=2000|month=July|pmid=10887249|url=http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/216/1/207?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=1&andorexacttitle=and&titleabstract=osteochondritis+dissecans&andorexacttitleabs=and&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&resourcetype=HWCIT}}</ref> Stages I and II are stable lesions. Stages III and IV describe unstable lesions in which a lesion of the cartilage has allowed [[synovial fluid]] between the fragment and bone.

===Non-surgical treatment===
Candidates for non-operative treatment are limited to skeletally immature teenagers with an relatively small, intact lesion and the absence of loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.<ref name="pmid13438964"/>

Once candidates for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds according to the lesions location. For example, those with OCD of the knee are immobilized for four to six weeks in [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] to remove shear stress from the involved area;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sofop.org/data/Upload/Images/file/POSNA%20Curriculum/2.8.5%20osteochondritisDissecansLower.pdf|title=Osteochondritis Dissecans|accessdate=2008-11-21|format=PDF|publisher=Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Fran<U+00E7>aise d'Orthop<U+00E9>die P<U+00E9>diatrique}}</ref> however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy and, if they reveal that the lesion has healed, then a gradual return to activities is instituted.<ref name="orthogateKNEEOCD"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedars-sinai.edu/12907.html|title=Treating Osteochondritis Dissecans|accessdate=2008-11-22|publisher=Cedars-Sinai Health}}</ref> Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.<ref name="pmid17980849"/>

===Surgical treatment===
[[Image:OATS-Arthroscopic Scan1.jpg|thumb|Arthroscopic image of OATs surgery on the [[medial condyle of femur|medial femoral condyle]] of the knee]]

The choice of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is still controversial.<ref name="pmid18509814">{{cite journal|author=Nobuta S, Ogawa K, Sato K, Nakagawa T, Hatori M, Itoi E|title=Clinical outcome of fragment fixation for osteochondritis dissecans of the elbow|journal=Upsala Journal of Medical Sciences|volume=113|issue=2|pages=201<U+2013>8|year=2008|pmid=18509814|url=http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_pub_diva-232-2__fulltext.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> Consequently, the type and extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon<U+2014>entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. Thus, a variety of surgical options exist for the treatment of persistently symptomatic, intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Unfortunately, post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in both [[glycosaminoglycan]] concentration, [[Histology|histological]], and [[Immunohistochemistry|immunohistochemical]] appearance.<ref name="pmid18006675">{{cite journal|author=LaPrade RF, Bursch LS, Olson EJ, Havlas V, Carlson CS|title=Histologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of failed articular cartilage resurfacing procedures for osteochondritis of the knee: a case series|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=36|issue=2|pages=360<U+2013>8|year=2008|month=February|pmid=18006675|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref> As a result, surgery is often avoided if  non-operative treatment is viable.

====Intact lesions====
If non-surgical measures are unsuccessful, drilling may be considered to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. [[Arthroscopic]] drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD,<ref name="pmid2768313">{{cite journal|author=Bradley J, Dandy DJ|title=Results of drilling osteochondritis dissecans before skeletal maturity|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (British)|volume=71|issue=4|pages=642<U+2013>4|year=1989|month=August|pmid=2768313|url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/71-B/4/642.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.<ref name="pmid9195028">{{cite journal|author=Anderson AF, Richards DB, Pagnani MJ, Hovis WD|title=Antegrade drilling for osteochondritis dissecans of the knee|journal=Arthroscopy|volume=13|issue=3|pages=319<U+2013>24|year=1997|month=June|pmid=9195028}}</ref>

====Hinged lesions====
Pins and screws can be used to secure flap (sometimes referred to as hinged) lesions.<ref name="pmid2206180">{{cite journal|author=Johnson LL, Uitvlugt G, Austin MD, Detrisac DA, Johnson C|title=Osteochondritis dissecans of the knee: arthroscopic compression screw fixation |journal=Arthroscopy|volume=6|issue=3|pages=179<U+2013>89|year=1990|pmid=2206180}}</ref> Bone pegs, metallic pins and screws, and other bioresorbable screws are all used to secure these types of lesions.<ref name="pmid3665256">{{cite journal|author=Thomson NL|title=Osteochondritis dissecans and osteochondral fragments managed by Herbert compression screw fixation|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=224|pages=71<U+2013>8|year=1987|month=November|pmid=3665256}}</ref>

====Full thickness lesions====

The three methods most commonly used in treating full thickness lesions are arthroscopic drilling, abrasion, and microfracturing.

In 1946, Magnusson established the use of stem cells from [[bone marrow]] with the first surgical [[debridement]] of an OCD lesion. These cells typically differentiate into [[fibrocartilage]] and rarely form hyaline cartilage. While small lesions can be resurfaced using this form of surgery, the repair tissue tends to have less strength than normal [[Hyaline cartilage|hyaline]] [[wikt:Articular Cartilage|cartilage]] and must be protected for 6 to 12 months. Results for large lesions tend to diminish over time; this can be attributed to the decreased resilience and poor wear-characteristics of the fibrocartilage.<ref name="pmid9850792">{{cite journal|author=Mandelbaum BR, Browne JE, Fu F, ''et al''|title=Articular cartilage lesions of the knee|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=26|issue=6|pages=853<U+2013>61|year=1998|pmid=9850792|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> 

In attempts to address the weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques have been designed to fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is [[autologous]] [[chondrocyte]] implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are [[arthroscopic]]ally extracted from the [[Intercondylar fossa of femur|intercondylar notch]] of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations.<ref name="pmid8078550">{{cite journal|author=Brittberg M, Lindahl A, Nilsson A, Ohlsson C, Isaksson O, Peterson L|title=Treatment of deep cartilage defects in the knee with autologous chondrocyte transplantation|journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=331|issue=14|pages=889<U+2013>95|year=1994|month=October|pmid=8078550|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/331/14/889|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref><ref name="pmid10818982">{{cite journal|author=Peterson L, Minas T, Brittberg M, Nilsson A, Sj<U+00F6>gren-Jansson E, Lindahl A|title=Two to Nine-year outcome after autologous chondrocyte transplantation of the knee|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|issue=374|pages=212<U+2013>34|year=2000|month=May|pmid=10818982|accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref> However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.<ref name="pmid9875939">{{cite journal|author=O'Driscoll SW|title=The healing and regeneration of articular cartilage|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American)|volume=80|issue=12|pages=1795<U+2013>1812|year=1998|month=December|pmid=9875939|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/reprint/80/12/1795.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Another method used to promote normal articular cartilage replacement is the technique of transplanting autologous osteochondral plugs. The [[Autologous|autografts]] are taken from a relatively "non-weight-bearing region" of the knee, such as the area just above the intercondylar notch or the edge of the [[patellar groove]], and inserted in the defect. OATS has reported good clinical results with plugs taken from the lateral facet of the patella when treating ten cases with large [[Femur|femoral]] OCD lesions.<ref name="pmid7822357">{{cite journal|author=Outerbridge HK, Outerbridge AR, Outerbridge RE|title=The use of a lateral patellar autologous graft for the repair of a large osteochondral defect in the knee|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (American)|volume=77|issue=1|pages=65<U+2013>72|year=1995|month=January|pmid=7822357}}</ref><ref name="pmid15346108">{{cite journal|author=Chow JC, Hantes ME, Houle JB, Zalavras CG|title=Arthroscopic autogenous osteochondral transplantation for treating knee cartilage defects: a 2- to 5-year follow-up study|journal=Arthroscopy|volume=20|issue=7|pages=681<U+2013>90|year=2004|month=September|pmid=15346108|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> OATs is limitated by donor site morbidity, plug damage from insertion, and the challenge of placing the plug edges flush with adjacent cartilage.<ref name="pmid16125942">{{cite journal|author=Karataglis D, Green MA, Learmonth DJ|title=Autologous osteochondral transplantation for the treatment of chondral defects of the knee|journal=Knee|volume=13|issue=1|pages=32<U+2013>5|year=2006|month=January|pmid=16125942|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> Fresh osteocartilaginous [[allografts]] have also been used for the treatment of OCD defects. In a study of 126 people with OCD of the knee, Ghazavi et al. reported an 85% success rate 7.5 years after OATs surgery with allografts. This procedure may be an option when other treatments have failed and symptoms persist.<ref name="pmid9393922">{{cite journal|author=Ghazavi MT, Pritzker KP, Davis AM, Gross AE|title=Fresh osteochondral allografts for post-traumatic osteochondral defects of the knee|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (British)|volume=79|issue=6|pages=1008<U+2013>13|year=1997|month=November|pmid=9393922|url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/reprint/79-B/6/1008}}</ref>

Similar to OATS, arthroscopic articular cartilage paste grafting is a relatively new surgical procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. An [[Wiktionary:osteocartilaginous|osteocartilaginous]] paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.<ref name="pmid16517314">{{cite journal|author=Stone KR, Walgenbach AW, Freyer A, Turek TJ, Speer DP|title=Articular cartilage paste grafting to full-thickness articular cartilage knee joint lesions: a 2- to 12-year follow-up|journal=Arthroscopy|volume=22|issue=3|pages=291<U+2013>9|year=2006|month=March|pmid=16517314|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>

====Unstable lesions====
Some methods of fixation for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and [[Timothy Herbert|Herbert screws]] or pins made of stainless steel or [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bioabsorption bioabsorbable] materials.<ref name="pmid17337729">{{cite journal|author=Kocher MS, Czarnecki JJ, Andersen JS, Micheli LJ|title=Internal fixation of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans lesions of the knee|journal=American Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=35|issue=5|pages=712<U+2013>8|year=2007|month=May|pmid=17337729|accessdate=2008-11-16}}</ref> Unstable lesions usually undergo fixation by stainless steel or bioresorbable pins, counter sunk compression screws or Herbert screws. If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.

====Rehabilitation====
Continuous passive motion (CPM) has been used to improve healing of the articular surface during postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (< 3&nbsp;mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits.<ref name="pmid7440603">{{cite journal|author=Salter RB, Simmonds DF, Malcolm BW, Rumble EJ, MacMichael D, Clements ND|title=The biological effect of continuous passive motion on the healing of full-thickness defects in articular cartilage.

Nevertheless, there is often a rehabilitation program that combines protection of the compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative [[analgesics]], namely a mix of [[opioids]] and [[NSAIDs]], are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/89718-treatment|title=Knee Osteochondritis Dissecans: Treatment & Medication |accessdate=2009-02-14|last=Jacobs B, Ertl JP, Kovacs G, Jacobs JA |date=2006-7-28|work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape}}</ref> Straight leg raising and other [[isometric exercise]]s are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period.   A six to eight-week home or formal [[physical therapy]] program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.<ref name="orthogateKNEEOCD">{{cite web|url=http://www.orthogate.org/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=185|title=Osteochondritis Dissecans of the Knee|accessdate=2008-11-16|date=2006-07-28|format=PDF|publisher=Orthogate}}</ref>

==Prognosis==
The prognosis after different treatments varies and is based on several factors which include the age of the patient, joint affected, stage of the lesion and, most importantly, the state of the growth plate.<ref name="cooperwebmd">{{cite web|url=http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic639.htm|title=Definition of osteochondritis dissecans|accessdate=2008-09-18|author=Cooper G, Russell W|work=eMedicine|publisher=Medscape}}</ref> It follows that the two main forms of osteochondritis dissecans are defined by skeletal maturity.

==Veterinary aspects==

In animals, OCD is considered a developmental and metabolic disorder related to cartilage growth and endochondral [[ossification]]. Osteochondritis itself signifies the disturbance of the usual growth process of cartilage, and OCD is the term used when this affects joint cartilage causing a fragment to become loose.<ref name="Pubmed1">{{cite journal|author=Berzon JL |title=Osteochondritis dissecans in the dog: diagnosis and therapy|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=175|issue=8|pages=796<U+2013>9|year=1979|pmid=393676}}</ref>

According to the Columbia Animal Hospital the frequency of affected animals is "Dogs, humans, pigs, horses, cattle, chickens, and turkeys", and in dogs
"The most commonly affected breeds include the German Shepherd, Golden and Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler, Great Dane, Bernese Mountain Dog, and Saint Bernard."<ref name="CAH">{{cite web|title=Osteochondrosis, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)|url=http://www.petshealthrx.com/encycEntry.cfm?ENTRY=8&COLLECTION=EncycIllness&MODE=full|work=Category: Canine |publisher=Columbia Animal Hospital|date=undated|accessdate=2008-09-13}}</ref> Although any joint may be affected, those commonly affected by OCD in the dog are: shoulder (often bilaterally), elbow, knee and [[Hock (zoology)|tarsal]].<ref name="CAH"/>

The problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on [[X-ray]]s, [[arthroscopy]], or [[MRI]] scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.<ref name="Ch.84OCD">{{cite book |author=Lenehan TM, Van Sickle DC|editor=Nunamaker DM, Newton CD (eds.)|chapter=Chapter 84: Canine osteochondrosis|chapterurl=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/chapter_84/84mast.htm|title=Textbook of small animal orthopaedics|url=http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/saortho/index.html|publisher=Lippincott|location=Philadelphia|year=1985|isbn=0-397-52098-0}}</ref>

Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].<ref name="Ch.84OCD"/>

==History==
In 1870, [[James Paget]] described the disease process for the first time, but it was not until 1887 that [[Franz K<U+00F6>nig (surgeon)|Franz K<U+00F6>nig]] published a paper on the cause of loose bodies in the joint.<ref name="pmid1868560">{{cite journal|author=Garrett JC|title=Osteochondritis dissecans|journal=Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine|volume=10|issue=3|pages=569<U+2013>93|year=1991|month=July|pmid=1868560}}</ref> In his paper, K<U+00F6>nig concluded that:<ref name="konig">{{cite journal|author=K<U+00F6>nig F|title=Uber freie Korper in den gelenken|journal=Deutsche Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Chirurgie |volume=27|issue=1<U+2013>2|pages=90<U+2013>109|year=1888|month=December|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m57696053j598h56/fulltext.pdf?page=1|language=German}}</ref>
# Trauma had to be very severe to break off parts of the joint surface.
# Less severe trauma might contuse the bone to cause an area of necrosis which might then separate.
# In some cases, the absence of notable trauma made it likely that there existed some spontaneous cause of separation.
