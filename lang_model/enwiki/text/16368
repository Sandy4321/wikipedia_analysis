The '''Taras Shevchenko Memorial''' is a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze statue]] and stone [[relief]]-adorned wall located on the 2200 block of [[P Street (Washington, D.C.)|P Street]] NW in the [[Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], United States.  It is one of many monuments in Washington, D.C. which honor foreign heroes who symbolize freedom in their native countries.  The memorial honors [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814&ndash;1861), a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] poet and artist who influenced the development of modern [[Ukrainian literature]].  The committee to build the memorial included former U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as the honorary head.  Opposition to the memorial's installation was led by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  It was dedicated in 1964, the 150th anniversary of Shevchenko's birth.  Dignitaries at the dedication ceremony included prominent [[Ukrainian American]]s, former U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], members of the U.S. Congress, and [[Hollywood]] actors.  Sculpted by [[Leo Mol]], the statue is one of two Ukrainian monuments in the nation's capital.  The second, a memorial to the Ukrainian victims of the [[Holodomor|1932&ndash;1933 famine]], is under construction.  The Taras Shevchenko Memorial and surrounding park are maintained by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].

===Background===
[[File:Taras Shevchenko - portrait by Ivan Kramskoi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Taras Shevchenko by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]]]
In addition to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes. Examples in [[Dupont Circle]] include memorials honoring [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] of India, [[Tom<U+00E1><U+0161> Garrigue Masaryk]] of Czechoslovakia, and [[Lajos Kossuth]] of Hungary.<ref name=slavic>{{cite web | url = http://www.loc.gov/rr/european/slavdc/aaass.html | title = Slavic and Central European Sights of Interest: Washington, DC and Vicinity | |last1 = Cannon | first1 = Angela | last2 = Leich | first2 = Harry | date = June 9, 2009 | work = European Reading Room | publisher = The Library of Congress | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=sweet>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/24/AR2005112400771.html | title = Sweet Land of Giving | last = Krauthammer | first = Charles | date = November 25, 2005 | work = The Washington Post | pages = A37 | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=nytimes>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/us/30memorial.html | title = A City of Memorials Finds Itself Filling Up | last = Barringer | first = Felicity | date = December 30, 2006 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898.  Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal.  A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in ''[[Svoboda (newspaper)|Svoboda]]'' titled "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] and [[Ukrainian Congress Committee of America]] (UCCA).  Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while [[Lev Dobriansky]], a Ukrainian American economist and [[anti-communism]] activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko.<ref name=sydoruk>{{cite news | url=http://ukrainianweek.com/Culture/19194 | title=Shevchenko in Washington | work=The Ukrainian Week | date=March 12, 2011 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 | author=Sydoruk, Arkadii | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UPklQQBg | archivedate=November 25, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=dobriansky>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/05/AR2008020503179_pf.html | title = Lev E.

Javits]] of [[New York]] and Representative [[Alvin Morell Bentley]] of [[Michigan]].<ref name=sydoruk/>  Javits said "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand in the capital of the U.S." and Bentley stated, "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people."<ref name=jovits>{{cite book | title=United States Congressional serial set, Volume 12269 | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | year=1960 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=41 | OCLC=191710879 }}</ref>

In April 1960, while a bill authorizing the erection of the statue was circulating through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], officials from the [[National Park Service]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] lodged a complaint to the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Administration]] committee about the number of monuments being built in Washington, D.C.  The bill was subsequently postponed.<ref name=shelved>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19600413&id=dgswAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_QAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7263,593677 | title=Bids For Monuments Grow Into Monumental Problem | work=The Blade | date=April 13, 1960 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  The resolution was later unanimously approved by the House of Representatives in June followed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in August.  On September 13, 1960, U.S. President [[Dwight D.

<blockquote>
Whereas throughout Eastern Europe, in the last century and this, the name and works of Taras Shevchenko brilliantly reflected the aspirations of man for personal liberty and national independence; and<br>
Whereas Shevchenko, the poet laureate of Ukraine, was greatly inspired by our great American tradition to fight against the imperialist and colonial occupation of his native land; and<br>
Whereas in many parts of the free world observances of the Shevchenko centennial will be held during 1961 in honor of this immortal champion of liberty; and<br>
Whereas in our moral capacity as free men in an independent Nation it behooves us to symbolize tangibly the inseparable spiritual ties bound in the writings of Shevchenko between our country and the forty million Ukraine nation:...<br>
</blockquote> 
In September 1960, UCCA president Dobriansky assisted with establishing the Taras Shevchenko Memorial Committee of America, Inc.  It was headed by Dobriansky, president of the General Council of Shevchenko societies Roman Smal-Stocky, and Ukrainian Free Academy of Sciences in the U.S.A. president [[George Shevelov]], with former U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] serving as an honorary head.  Later that year a design competition was announced with one of the requirements being "the public at large to see the poet depicted in his youth."  Seventeen sculpture designs were submitted and on July 14, 1962, the committee unanimously chose the one by Leonid Molozhanyn ([[Leo Mol]]), a [[Ukrainian Canadian]] who would go on to sculpt works in several countries depicting Shevchenko.<ref name=sydoruk/><ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=mayes>{{cite news | url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/accomplished-artist-leo-mol-was-manitobas-best-known-and-most-honoured-sculptor-50117947.html | title=Accomplished Artist: Leo Mol was Manitoba's best-known and most honoured sculptor | work=Winnipeg Free Press | date=July 7, 2009 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 | author=Mayes, Alison | pages=A4 }}</ref>  Mol was paid $1,500 for winning the competition while two second place artists were each paid $1,000, and two third place artists paid $750 each.<ref name=sydoruk/>  The total cost of the memorial was around $250,000, which was paid for by the UCCA and donations made by over 50,000 people, mostly Ukrainian-Americans.<ref name=lauded>{{cite news | title=Ukrainian Poet Lauded At Ceremony | work=The Washington Post | date=September 22, 1963 | pages=B4 }}</ref><ref name=theblade>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat=19640107&id=bQJPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SwEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7301,2241941 | title=19th Century Poet Gets Into Cold War | work=The Blade | date=January 8, 1964 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 | pages=32 }}</ref><ref name=haluszczak>{{cite book | title=Ukrainians of Western Pennsylvania | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Haluszczak, Stephen P. | year=2009 | location=Charleston | pages=34 | isbn=9781439637401 }}</ref><ref name=sydoruk/>  The design and layout of the memorial site was approved by the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts|U.S. Commission of Fine Arts]] in April 1963.<ref name=sydoruk/>  The site was designed by architect Radoslav Zuk and the contractor was the M. Cain Company.  The stonework was provided by the Jones Brother Company while the carving was completed by Vincent Illuzzi.<ref name=smithsonian/>

====Opposition====
The choice of Shevchenko as the subject for a statue was not without controversy.  Opponents, such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' editorial board, argued "the Ukrainian poet is known to only a few Americans, he is the idol of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]], he is [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]]."<ref name=sydoruk/><ref name=goode>{{cite book | title=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | author=Goode, James M. | year=1974 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=298 | isbn=9780874741384 }}</ref>  Following the strongly worded editorial's publication, there was a deluge of angry responses, including from members of Congress like Representatives [[Thaddeus J. Dulski]] of New York and [[Ed Derwinski]] of [[Illinois]].  Derwinski said erecting a memorial to Shevchenko seemed appropriate when compared with some of the other statues in the city, such as those honoring [[Dante Alighieri (Ximenes)|Dante]], [[Edmund Burke (Thomas)|Edmund Burke]], and [[General Jose de San Martin Memorial|Jose de San Martin]].<ref name=theblade/>  After more than 2,000 people gathered at the memorial site for the groundbreaking ceremony on September 21, 1963, there were repeated calls during the next several months for the memorial plans to be scrapped.<ref name=sydoruk/><ref name=lauded/>  In November, a member of the [[National Capital Planning Commission]], which was required to approve the statue according to the congressional resolution, called for the cancellation of the memorial.<ref name=theblade/><ref name=renewed>{{cite news | title=Statue to Ukrainian Meets Renewed Opposition | work=The Washington Post | date=November 8, 1963 | pages=B5 }}</ref>  The next month Secretary of the Interior [[Stewart Udall]] said he wanted to review plans to construct the memorial.<ref name=review>{{cite news | title=Udall Urges Review of Shevchenko | work=The Washington Post | date=December 6, 1963 }}</ref>  Attempts to derail the project ultimately failed when capital planners said they lacked the authority to stop the erection of the statue.<ref name=block>{{cite news | title=Planners Bypass Shevchenko | work=The Washington Post | date=January 10, 1964 | pages=C1 }}</ref>

Initially [[Soviet Union]] officials, including the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C.|Soviet embassy]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] representatives at the [[United Nations]], were opposed to the memorial and demanded the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] cancel the plans.<ref name=sydoruk/>  They eventually accepted the idea and the Soviet embassy requested to be involved with the memorial's dedication.<ref name=theblade/>  This did not occur though because the memorial's inscription was "carefully worded by the statue's sponsors to embarrass the Soviet Union and to discourage Soviet delegations from laying wreaths at the memorial."<ref name=milwaukee>{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19640627&id=fHskAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4439,3209063 | title=Washington Statue of Ukrainian Hero Dedicated By Ike | work=The Milwaukee Journal | date=June 27, 1964 | accessdate=November 28, 2014 }}</ref>

===Dedication===
[[File:Taras Shevchenko statue unveiling.jpg|thumb|Former U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] unveiling the statue.]]
The statue, [[Foundry|founded]] by the Bedi-Rassy Art Foundry, was placed on its pedestal on June 3, 1964.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=placed>{{cite news | title=Controversial Statue Placed on Its Pedestal | work=The Washington Post | date=June 4, 1964 | pages=A2 }}</ref>  The memorial dedication ceremony took place a few weeks later on June 27.<ref name=smithsonian/>  The day-long festivities included concerts at [[DAR Constitution Hall]] and a procession of around 35,000 people of Ukrainian descent, many wearing native clothing, marching from the [[The Ellipse|Ellipse]] to the memorial site.<ref name=milwaukee/><ref name=weekly>{{cite news | url=http://ukrweekly.com/archive/pdf2/1964/The_Ukrainian_Weekly_1964-25.pdf | title=Shevchenko Monument - A "New Statue of Liberty" - Unveiled In Washington By General Eisenhower In Solemn Ceremonies | work=The Ukrainian Weekly | date=July 3, 1964 | accessdate=November 28, 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UNrHr208 | archivedate=November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  The parade marchers, arriving by buses and cars decorated with stickers, flags, and [[Flag of Ukraine|blue and yellow]] signs, had been gathering since early in the morning.  Led by Colonel William Ryback, it took four hours for all the participants to march past the [[White House]], west on [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], and north on 23rd Street to the memorial site.<ref name=weekly/>  There were approximately 100,000 people in attendance at the ceremony, including delegations from [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[West Germany|Germany]], and the [[United Kingdom]], as well as U.S. government representatives and foreign ambassadors.<ref name=sydoruk/><ref name=weekly/>  In addition to Leo Mol, dignitaries in attendance included the following: [[Stepan Vytvytskyi]], president of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile; UCCA president Dobriansky and other leaders of Ukrainian American organizations like [[Ukrainian National Association]] president Joseph Sawyer, Archbishops [[Ambrose Senyshyn]] and [[Mstyslav (Skrypnyk)|Mstyslav Skrypnyk]]; U.S. Representatives Derwinksi, Dulski, [[Michael A. Feighan]] of [[Ohio]], and [[Daniel J. Flood]] of [[Pennsylvania]]; actors [[Jack Palance]] and [[Mike Mazurki]]; and Miss World United States [[Michele Rollins|Michele Metrinko]].<ref name=weekly/>

The ceremony was opened by Dobriansky followed by a rendition of the U.S. national anthem, "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]".  Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke about the significance of the monument.<ref name=weekly/>  Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower, who was chosen to unveil the statue.<ref name=nytimes/>  Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted "We Like Ike!"  Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: "For my hope is that your magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument to the foot of the statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world."<ref name=sydoruk/>  He also said the statue represented "millions of oppressed" in [[Eastern Europe]] and "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be."<ref name=milwaukee/>  Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem ''[[Taras Shevchenko#Example of poetry: .22Testament.22 .28Zapovit.29|Testament]]''.  Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych gave the benediction.  The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, ''[[Shche ne vmerla Ukraina]]'' (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).<ref name=weekly/>

===Later history===
A stainless steel [[urn]] containing soil from Shevchenko's grave was installed at the base of the memorial in May 1965.  A commemorative book which includes a brief history of the monument, a list of the memorial fund donors, and other documents related to the site were also installed in the base.<ref name=sydoruk/>  The memorial was the site of protest rallies held by Ukrainian Americans who objected to the Soviet Union's policies.  It has been described as "a symbol of Ukrainian independence and a rallying point of the Ukrainian-American community."<ref name=toledo>{{cite news | title = Soviet U.S. Embassy is Scene of Protest | date = May 22, 1983 | work = The Blade | publisher = Associated Press | pages = A2 }}</ref><ref name=miller>{{cite news | url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2943/Head_of_Ukrainian_GreekCatholic_Church_made_official_visit_to_the_United_States.aspx | title=Head of Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church made official visit to the United States | work=The Catholic World Report | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 | author=Miller, Michael J. }}</ref>  Ukrainian dignitaries still visit the memorial, such as President [[Viktor Yushchenko]], who laid a wreath at the statue in April 2005.<ref name=wreath>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53139-2005Apr14.html | title = Instating the Draft | last = Hahn | first = Fritz | date = April 15, 2005 | work = The Washington Post | pages = WE05 | accessdate = November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  [[Sviatoslav Shevchuk]], head of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], and [[Olexander Motsyk]], Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, each visited the site in 2014.<ref name=miller/><ref name=embassy>{{cite web | url=http://usa.mfa.gov.ua/en/press-center/news/19174-posolystvo-ukrajini-v-ssha-poklalo-kviti-do-pamjatniku-tarasu-shevchenku-v-vashingtoni | title=Embassy of Ukraine to the USA laid flowers to Taras Shevchenko Monument in Washington DC | publisher=Embassy of Ukraine to the United States | date=March 8, 2014 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 }}</ref>  The memorial site is administered by the National Park Service, a federal agency of the Interior Department.<ref name=smithsonian/>

===Second Ukrainian monument===
In 2006, the U.S. Congress approved a monument to honor the millions of Ukrainians who died as a result of the 1932&ndash;1933 [[Holodomor]], a [[famine]]-[[genocide]] caused by the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=famine>{{cite book | title = The Nature of Hate | last1 = Sternberg | first1 = Robert | last2 = Sternberg | first2 = Karin | year=2008 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0521896983 | page = 67 }}</ref><ref name=soviet>{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/26/AR2008042602039.html?sub=new | title = Aftermath of a Soviet Famine | last = Finn | first = Peter | date = April 27, 2008 | work = The Washington Post | page = A14 | accessdate = November 26, 2014 }}</ref>  The memorial site is located on a triangular lot on [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenue]] NW near [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]].<ref name=dietsch>{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/local-architect-designs-washington-memorial-to-victims-of-genocidal-famine-in-ukraine/2014/07/22/a7315c0a-fbe9-11e3-8176-f2c941cf35f1_story.html | title=Local architect designs Washington memorial to victims of genocidal famine in Ukraine | work=The Washington Post | date=July 24, 2014 | accessdate=November 27, 2014 | author=Dietsch, Deborah K. | pages=A23 }}</ref>  When completed, it will be the second memorial in Washington, D.C. to honor victims of Communism; the other being the [[Victims of Communism Memorial]], also located near Union Station.<ref name=nytimes/>

==Design and location==
[[File:Taras Shevchenko Memorial - Prometheus relief.JPG|thumb|The granite wall and relief of [[Prometheus]].]]
The memorial is located in the middle of a triangular park, bounded by P Street (south) and 22nd Street (east and west) NW, across the street from the [[Church of the Pilgrims]] and one block from [[Rock Creek Park]].{{ref|a}}  It consists of a bronze statue on a [[Vermont]] granite base next to a Vermont granite wall with relief.  The statue is approximately {{convert|14|ft|sp=uk}} tall, {{convert|4.7|ft|sp=uk}} wide, and {{convert|4.6|ft|sp=uk}} long while the base is approximately {{convert|7|ft|sp=uk}} tall.  The statue, which faces south, depicts Shevchenko wearing a long suit coat and stepping forward as his left hand holds his jacket lapel.  His slightly opened right hand is pointed downwards and hangs by his side.  Shevchenko is also depicted as a young-to-middle age adult with short wavy hair and a moustache.  The relief depicts the martyred [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god [[Prometheus]].  The statue and wall are on a four-stepped platform surrounded by a stone plaza.<ref name=smithsonian/>
