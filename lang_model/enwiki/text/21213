'''Al-Azhar Mosque''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0623><U+0632><U+0647><U+0631>}} {{lang|ar-Latn|''G<U+0101>ma` al-Azhar''}}, "mosque of the most resplendent") is a [[mosque]] in [[Islamic Cairo]] in [[Egypt]]. The mosque was commissioned in 970 by [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah|al-Mu<U+2018>izz li-D<U+012B>n All<U+0101>h]] of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] for the newly established capital city. Its name is usually thought to allude to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad|Muhammad's]] daughter [[Fatimah|Fatimah]], a revered figure in Islam who was given the title ''az-Zahra'' (the shining one). It was the first mosque established in [[Cairo]], a city that has since gained the nickname "the city of a thousand minarets."{{ref label|oldest|i|}}<ref name=islamic_arch_58 /><ref name=rivoira_153>{{Harvnb|Rivoira|Rushforth|1918|p=153}}</ref><ref name=siddiqi_4>{{Harvnb|Siddiqi|2007|p=4}}</ref> 

After its dedication in 972, and with the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 scholars in 989, the mosque slowly developed into what was to become the second oldest continuously run university in the world.<ref name=univ_hist_9>{{Harvnb|Summerfield|Devine|Levy|1998|p=9}}</ref> [[Al-Azhar University]] has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world for the study of Sunni theology and [[Sharia]] law.<ref name=yeomans_51>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=51}}</ref> The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque-school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961 following the Egyptian revolution.<ref name=univ_hist_9 /> 

The mosque has been alternately neglected and highly regarded over the course of its over a millennia long history. Initially founded as an [[Ismailism|Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li]] institution, Saladin and the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Ayyubid dynasty that he founded shunned the institution, removing its status as a congregational mosque and denying stipends to students and teachers at its school. These moves were reversed under the Mamluk Sultanate, under whose rule numerous expansions and renovations took place. Later rulers of Egypt showed differing degrees of deference to the mosque, and provide widely varying levels of financial assistance both to the school and to the upkeep of the mosque.

Given its history, al-Azhar remains a deeply influential institution in Egyptian society and a symbol of of Islamic Egypt.<ref name=islamic_monuments_151>{{Harvnb|Williams|Parker|Sabin|Dobrowolski|2002|p=151}}</ref><ref name=binder_340>{{Harvnb|Binder|1988|p=340}}</ref>

==Name==
[[File:Binte Muhammad.jpg|thumb|Arabic calligraphy reading ''Fatima az-Zahra'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0641><U+0627><U+0637><U+0645><U+0629>&nbsp;<U+0627><U+0644><U+0632><U+0647><U+0631><U+0627><U+0621>}})]]
The city of Cairo was established by [[Gawhar al-Siqilli|Gawhar al-<U+1E62>iqill<U+012B>]], the Fatimid general, who originally named it ''al-Mansuriyya'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0646><U+0635><U+0648><U+0631><U+064A><U+0647>}}) after the prior seat of the Fatimid caliphate, [[al-Mansuriya]], in modern [[Tunisia]]. The mosque may have initially been named ''J<U+0101>mi' al-Mansuriyya'' ({{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0646><U+0635><U+0648><U+0631><U+064A><U+0647>}}, "the mosque of Mansuriyya"), as was the common practice of the time.<ref name=rabbat_53>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=53}}</ref> It was the Caliph li-D<U+012B>n All<U+0101>h who renamed the city ''al-Q<U+0101>hira'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+0642><U+0627><U+0647><U+0631><U+0629><U+200E>}}, "Cairo", meaning, "the Victorious"). The name of the mosque thus became ''J<U+0101>mi' al-Q<U+0101>hira'' ({{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0627><U+0645><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0642><U+0627><U+0647><U+0631><U+0629><U+200E>}}, "the mosque of Cairo"), the first name of the mosque transcribed in Arabic sources.<ref name=rabbat_53 /> 

The mosque acquired its current name, ''al-Azhar'', during the reign of the second Fatimid caliph in Egypt, [[Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah|al-Aziz Billah]].<ref name=rabbat_53 /> ''Azhar'' is the masculine form for ''zahra'', meaning "splendid" or "most resplendent." ''Zahra'' is an [[epithet]] applied to [[Fatimah]], Muhammad's daughter by his first wife [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]].<ref name=bennison_104>{{Harvnb|Bennison|Gascoigne|2007|p=104}}</ref> Fatimah, the wife of caliph [[Ali|Al<U+012B> ibn Ab<U+012B> <U+1E6C><U+0101>lib's]], was claimed as the ancestress of al-Mu'izz li-Din All<U+0101>h and the [[imam]]s of the Fatimid dynasty; the name of the mosque is generally thought to reference her.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tracy|2000|p=507}}</ref><ref name=Hitti_114>{{Harvnb|Hitti|1973|p=114}}</ref>

Another theory for the choice of ''al-Azhar'' is that it is derived from the names the Fatimid caliphs had given to their palaces. The palaces near al-Azhar were given the name, collectively, of ''al-Qusur al-Zahira'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0627><U+0644><U+0642><U+0635><U+0648><U+0631> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0632><U+0627><U+0647><U+0631><U+0629>}}, "the Brilliant Palaces") by al-Aziz Billah. The palaces had been completed and named prior to ''al-Azhar'' changing its name from ''J<U+0101>mi' al-Q<U+0101>hira''.<ref name=rabbat_53 />

The word ''J<U+0101>mi''' is derived from the Arabic root word ''j<U+0101>ma<U+0295>a'', meaning "to gather". The word is used for large congregational mosques. While in [[classical Arabic]] the name for al-Azhar remains ''J<U+0101>mi' al-Azhar'', the pronunciation of the word <i>J<U+0101>mi'</i> changes to <i>G<U+0101>ma'</i> in [[Egyptian Arabic]]. One of the main identifying characteristics of Egyptian Arabic is the hard ''g'' in place of ''j'' in the pronunciation of the letter ''[[Gimel#Arabic <U+01E7><U+012B>m|<U+01E7><U+012B>m]].'' This modification dates to some time between the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Izre'el|Raz|1996|p=153}}</ref>

==History==
Throughout its thousand-year history, al-Azhar has held a special status in Egyptian society, both as a religious institution and as a place for higher learning. Initially founded by the Fatimids as the base of Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li theology, al-Azhar has played an important role in both the state and the country of Egypt for most of its history. Following the defeat of the Fatimids at the hands of the Sunni [[Saladin]], al-Azhar temporarily lost its status as the center of the religious establishments, though it did continue to function as a university. The [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] saw the restoration and enhancement of of al-Azhar, both in prestige and in the additions to the mosque itself. Under Ottoman rule al-Azhar continued to serve as the seat of the ''ulema'' of Egypt, and, despite efforts to subject it to government oversight, it retained its independence. The French occupation of Egypt began a series of events that saw the educational system of al-Azhar modernized, with courses outside of the traditional areas of study, such as ''[[fiqh]]'' and ''[[sharia]]'', being offered. These reforms continued under the rule of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] and the British occupation. Following the Egyptian Revolution, al-Azhar was further transformed and placed under direct government control. Although its independence has been hindered by recent governments in Egypt, al-Azhar still retains a status within Egypt and throughout the Arab and Muslim world as the leading authority on Sunni jurisprudence.

===Fatimid Caliphate===

The minaret in the far background was built by Katkhuda]]

Caliph al-Mu<U+2019>izz li-Din All<U+0101>h, the fourth [[List of Ismaili Imams|Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li Imam]] (through his general, al-<U+1E62>iqill<U+012B>), conquered Egypt, wresting it from the Sunni [[Ikhshidid dynasty]].<ref name=univ_hist_9 /><ref name=islamic_monuments_151/> By order of the Caliph, al-<U+1E62>iqill<U+012B> then oversaw the construction of the royal enclosure of the Fatimid Caliphate and its army, and had al-Azhar built as a base to spread Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li [[Shia Islam]].<ref name=univ_hist_9 /> Located near the densely populated Sunni city of [[Fustat]], Cairo became the center of the Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li sect of Shia Islam, and seat of the Fatimid empire.<ref name=petry_139>{{Harvnb|Petry|1998|p=139}}</ref> 

Built to serve as the congregational mosque of Cairo, al-Azhar soon became a center of learning in the Islamic world.<ref name=univ_hist_9 /> Official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there.<ref name=univ_hist_9 /> Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li ''[[madhab]]'' ("school of law") were made available to the general public.<ref name=yeomans_52>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=52}}</ref> [[Qadi al-Nu'man|Al-Nu<U+2018>man ibn Muhammad]] was appointed ''[[qadi]]'' under li-Din All<U+0101>h and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li ''madhab''.<ref name=yeomans_52 /> Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women.<ref name=yeomans_53 /><ref name=daftary_96>{{Harvnb|Daftary|1998|p=96}}</ref> 

Fatimid efforts to establish Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li practice among the population were largely unsuccessful, and al-Azhar became a Sunni institution shortly after the fall of that empire.<ref name=petry_139 /> In 988 CE, Ibn Killis, a polymath, jurist and the first official vizier of the Fatimids, made al-Azhar a key center for instruction in Islamic law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Daftary|1998|p=95}}</ref> In 989, 45 scholars were hired to give lessons, laying the foundation for what would become the leading university in the Muslim world.<ref name=islamic_arch_58 /> Initially lacking a library, al-Azhar was endowed by the Fatimid caliph in 1005 with thousands of manuscripts that formed the basis of its collection. Much of that collection was dispersed in the chaos that ensued after the dynasty's collapse.<ref name=univ_hist_10 />

===Ayyubid dynasty===
Saladin, who overthrew the Fatimids in 1171, was hostile to the Shi<U+2019>ite principles of learning propounded at al-Azhar, and under his [[Ayyubid dynasty]] the teaching center at the mosque suffered from neglect. Student funding was withdrawn and congregational prayers were banned by Sadr al-Din ibn Dirbass, appointed ''qadi'' by Saladin.<ref name=rabbat_56 /> This is attributed variously to [[Shafi`i|Sh<U+0101>fi<U+2018><U+012B>]] teachings that proscribe congregational prayers in a community to only one mosque, or to mistrust of the former Shia institution by the new Sunni ruler.<ref name=islamic_arch_60>{{Harvnb|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|p=60}}</ref><ref name=univ_hist_10>{{Harvnb|Summerfield|Devine|Levy|1998|p=10}}</ref> 

By this time, the much larger [[al-Hakim Mosque]] was completed; congregational prayers in Cairo were held there. Al-Azhar nevertheless remained the seat of Arabic philology throughout this period. While the Ayyubid dynasty neglected al-Azhar as a mosque and promoted the teaching of Sunni theology in subsidized ''[[madrasa]]s'' built throughout Cairo, al-Azhar remained a place of learning, though it was denied financial assistance from the government.<ref name=rabbat_56>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=56}}</ref> It eventually adopted Saladin's educational reforms modeled on the college system he instituted, and its fortunes improved under the [[Mamluk]]s, who restored student stipends and salaries for the teaching staff (''[[sheikh]]s'').<ref name=univ_hist_10 />

===Mamluk Sultanate===
[[File:Murad Bey by Dutertre in Description de l Egypte 1809.jpg|thumb|left|A Mamluk ''bey'']]

Congregational prayers were reestablished during the Mamluk Sultanate by [[Baibars|Sultan Baibars]] in 1266. Followers of the [[Hanafi]] ''madhab'', no restriction on the number of congregational mosques applied.<ref name=islamic_arch_60 /> Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and the Ism<U+0101><U+02BF><U+012B>li doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque that had been neglected for nearly 100 years.<ref name=lulat_77>{{Harvnb|Lulat|2005|p=77}}</ref>

An earthquake in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar and a number of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the ''[[amir]]s'' ("princes") of the Sultanate and the head of the army, [[Amir Salar]], who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars.<ref name=rabbat_57 /> Shortly after the earthquake two new ''madrasas'' were built to complement the space in al-Azhar, the ''Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya'' and the ''Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya''. Each building was originally intended to be a stand-alone mosque before eventually being absorbed into al-Azhar, though they have remained physically separate from the mosque.<ref name=rabbat_57 />

Repairs and additional work were carried out by those in positions lower than sultan, though the mosque had regained its standing within Cairo under the Mamluks. This changed under the rule of [[Barquq|al-Zahir Barquq]], the first sultan of the [[Burji dynasty]]. The resumption of direct patronage by those in the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans [[Qaytbay]] and [[Qansuh al-Ghuri]], each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets.<ref name=rabbat_58>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=58}}</ref> As the preeminent learning center in the Islamic world, the sultans wished to have a noticeable association with al-Azhar. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape.<ref name=rabbat_58 />

Although the mosque-school was the leading university in the Islamic world and had regained royal patronage, it did not overtake the ''madrasas'' as the favored place of education among Cairo's elite. Al-Azhar maintained its reputation as an independent place of learning, whereas the ''madrasas'' that had first been constructed during Saladin's rule were fully integrated into the state educational system. Al-Azhar did continue to attract students from other areas in Egypt and the Middle East, far surpassing the numbers attending the ''madrasas''.<ref name=rabbat_59>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=59}}</ref> The student body was organized in ''riwaqs'', or fraternities, along national lines, and the branches of Islamic law were studied. The average degree required six years of study.<ref name=univ_hist_10 /> 

By the 14th century, al-Azhar had achieved a preeminent place as the center for studies in law, theology, and Arabic, becoming a cynosure for students all around the Islamic world.<ref name=univ_hist_10 /> However, among the ''ulema'' of Egypt, only one third were reported to have either attended or taught at al-Azhar.<ref name=rabbat_59 /> One account, by [[Muhammad ibn Iyas]], reports that the ''[[Madrasa as-Salihiya]]'', and not al-Azhar, was viewed as the "citadel of the ''ulema''" at the end of the Mamluk Sultanate.<ref name=winter_115 />

===Province of the Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Al-Azhar bab al-muzaynin.jpg|thumb|''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'', built by Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda during Ottoman rule. The minaret on the left, atop the ''Madrasa Aqbaghawiyya'', was also remodeled by Katkhuda]]

With the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] annexation of 1517, despite the mayhem their fight to control the city engendered, the Turks showed great deference to the mosque and its college, though direct royal patronage ceased.<ref name=univ_hist_10 /><ref name=rabbat_59 /> Sultan [[Selim I]], the first Ottoman ruler of Egypt, attended al-Azhar for the congregational [[Jumu'ah|Friday prayer]] during his last week in Egypt, but did not donate anything to the upkeep of the mosque. Later Ottoman ''emirs'' likewise regularly attended Friday prayers at al-Azhar but rarely provided subsidies for the maintenance of the mosque, though they did on occasion provide stipends for students and teachers. In contrast to the expansions and additions under the Mamluk Sultanate, only two Ottoman ''wal<U+012B>s'' ("governors") restored al-Azhar during the early Ottoman period.<ref name=rabbat_59 /> 

Despite having been defeated by the Selim I and the Ottomans in 1517, the Mamluks remained an influential sector of Egyptian society, becoming ''[[bey]]s'', or chieftains, nominally under the control of the Ottoman governors instead of ''emirs'' at the head of an empire.<ref name=rabbat_59 /> The first governor of Egypt under Selim I was a Mamluk ''emir'', [[Khai'r Bey]], who had defected to the Ottomans during the [[Battle of Marj Dabiq]].<ref name=winter_12>{{Harvnb|Winter|2004|p=12}}</ref> Despite multiple revolts to reinstate the Mamluk Sultanate, including twice in 1523,<ref name=winter_14>{{Harvnb|Winter|2004|p=14}}</ref> the Ottomans did not completely destroy the Mamluk hold over the power structure of Egypt. The Mamluks did suffer losses<U+2014>both economic and military<U+2014>in the immediate aftermath of the Ottoman victory and this can be seen in the lack of financial assistance provided to al-Azhar in the first hundred years of Ottoman rule. By the 18th century the Mamluk elite had regained much of its influence and began to sponsor numerous renovations throughout Cairo and at al-Azhar specifically.<ref name=rabbat_59 />

Al-Qazdughli, a powerful Mamluk ''bey'', sponsored several additions and renovations in the early 18th century. Under his direction, a ''riwaq'' for blind students was added in 1735. He also sponsored the rebuilding of the Turkish and Syrian ''riwaqs'', both of which had originally been built by Qaytbay.<ref name=rabbat_59_60>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|pp=59-60}}</ref> This began the largest set of renovations since the expansions under the Mamluk Sultanate. Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda was appointed ''katkhuda'' (head of the [[Janissary|Janissaries]]) in 1749 and embarked on several projects throughout Cairo and within al-Azhar. Under his direction, three new gates were built: the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'', which eventually became the main entrance to the mosque; the ''Bab al-Sa'ayida''; and, several years later, the ''Bab al-Shurba''. A prayer hall was added south of the original one, doubling the size of the available prayer space. Katkhuda also refurbished or rebuilt several of the ''riwaqs'' that surrounded the mosque. Katkhuda was buried in a mausoleum he himself had built in Al-Azhar; in 1776, he became the first person (and the last) to be interred within the mosque since Nafissa al-Bakriyya, a female mystic who had died around 1588.<ref name=rabbat_49_50 /><ref name=rabbat_60_61>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|pp=60-61}}</ref>

During the Ottoman period al-Azhar regained its status as a favored institution of learning in Egypt itself, overtaking the ''madrasas'' that had been originally instituted by Saladin and greatly expanded by the Mamluks. By the end of the 18th century al-Azhar had become inextricably linked with the ''ulema'' of Egypt, compared to the end of the Mamluk Sultanate where only one third either were educated or taught at al-Azhar.<ref name=winter_115>{{Harvnb|Winter|2004|p=115}}</ref> The ''ulema'' also were able to influence the government in an official capacity, with several ''sheikhs'' appointed to advisory councils that reported to the ''[[pasha]]'', who in turn was appointed for only one year.<ref name=abu_zayd_36>{{Harvnb|Abu Zayd|Amirpur|Setiawan|2006|p=36}}</ref>

Al-Azhar also served as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman occupation of Egypt, both from within the ''ulema'' and from the general public. Protests by students were common and often shops in the vicinity of the mosque would close out of solidarity with the students.<ref name=winter_120>{{Harvnb|Winter|2004|p=120}}</ref> The ''ulema'' was also on occasion able to force its will over the government. In one instance, in 1730-31, Ottoman ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]s'' harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the ''aghas'' to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the ''wal<U+012B>'' harassed the people near the [[al-Hussein Mosque]], who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The ''wal<U+012B>'' was dismissed from his post.<ref name=winter_121>{{Harvnb|Winter|2004|p=121}}</ref>

Napoleon, who had been well-respected in Egypt and had earned himself the nickname ''Sultan el-Kebir'' (the Great Sultan) among the people of Cairo, lost their admiration and was no longer so addressed.<ref name=flower_27>{{Harvnb|Flower|1976|p=27}}</ref> In March 1800, French General [[Jean Baptiste Kl<U+00E9>ber]] was assassinated by an al-Azhar student, [[Suleiman al-Halabi]]. Following the assassination, Napoleon ordered the closing of the mosque; the doors remained bolted until Ottoman and British assistance arrived in August of 1801.<ref name=rabbat_61 />

The conservative tradition of the mosque, with its lack of attention to science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930.<ref name=univ_hist_11>{{Harvnb|Summerfield|Devine|Levy|1998|p=11}}</ref> Upon the withdrawal of the French, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] encouraged the establishment of secular learning; history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum.<ref name=univ_hist_11 /> By 1872, under the direction of [[Jamal-al-Din Afghani|Jam<U+0101>l al-D<U+012B>n al-Afgh<U+0101>n<U+012B>]], [[European philosophy]] was also added to the study program.<ref name=univ_hist_11 />

===Muhammad Ali Dynasty and British occupation===
[[File:ModernEgypt, Muhammad Ali by Auguste Couder, BAP 17996.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali, founder of the Alawiyya Dynasty which ruled Egypt from 1805 until the Egyptian Revolution in 1952]]

Following the French withdrawal from Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] sought to consolidate his newly found power in Egypt. To achieve this goal he made a series of moves designed to limit, and eventually subjugate, the ability of the al-Azhar ''ulema'' to influence the government. He imposed taxes on ''rizqa'' lands, tax-free property owned by mosques and ''madrasas'', from which al-Azhar drew a major portion of its income.<ref name=rabbat_61 /> In June 1809, he ordered that the deeds to all ''rizqa'' lands be forfeited to the state in a move that provoked outrage among the ''ulema''. Umar Makram, the ''naqib al-ashraf'', a prestigious Islamic post, led a revolt in July 1809. The revolt failed and Makram, an influential ally of the ''ulema'', was exiled to [[Damietta]].<ref name=petry_148>{{Harvnb|Petry|1998|p=148}}</ref> Ali also sought to limit the influence of the al-Azhar ''sheikhs'' by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system based on that model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.<ref name=rabbat_61 />

The reign of [[Isma'il Pasha]], Ali's grandson, brought the return of royal patronage to al-Azhar. Isma'il Pasha, as ''[[khedive]]'' of Egypt, restored the ''Bab al-Sa'yida'', first built by Katkhuda, and the ''Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya''. [[Tewfik Pasha]], Isma'il's son, who became ''khedive'' when his father was deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, also aligning the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it, and remodeled several other areas of the mosque. [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi]] succeeded his father Tewfik as ''khedive'' of Egypt in 1892 and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new ''riwaq''. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (initially formed under French occupation), also restored the original Fatimid ''sahn''. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what was becoming a metropolis.<ref name=rabbat_62>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=62}}</ref> Under Isma'il Pasha, major public works projects were started with the aim of transforming Cairo into a European styled city.<ref name=raymond_312>{{Harvnb|Raymond|2000|p=312}}</ref> These projects, initially funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.<ref name=raymond_312 /><ref name=shillington_199>{{Harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=199}}</ref> Muhammad Mahdi al-'Abbasi, ''sheikh al-Azhar'', had instituted a set of reforms in 1872 intended to provide structure to the hiring practices of the university as well as to standardize the examinations taken by students. Further efforts to modernize the educational system were made during Hilmi's rule during the British occupation.<ref name=rabbat_63 /> 

A major set of reforms began under the rule of Isma'il Pasha and continued with the British occupation.<ref name=univ_hist_12>{{Harvnb|Summerfield|Devine|Levy|1998|p=12}}</ref> The mosque<U+2019>s manuscripts were gathered into a centralized library, sanitation for students improved, a regular system of exams instituted and from 1885, other colleges in Egypt were placed directly under the administration of the al-Azhar Mosque. While a bastion of conservatism in many regards, the mosque was opposed to Islamic fundamentalism, especially as espoused by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], founded in 1928.<ref name=univ_hist_12 /> The school also attracted students from throughout the world, providing a counterbalance to the influence of the [[Wahabbis]] in Saudi Arabia, attracting students from [[Southeast Asia]], particularly from [[Indonesia]].<ref name=abu_zayd_19>{{Harvnb|Abu Zayd|Amirpur|Setiawan|2006|p=19}}</ref> While [[Saad Zaghloul|Sa'ad Zaghloul]], who would later lead the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first Egyptian revolution]], was minister of education, further efforts were made to modify the educational policy of al-Azhar. Under [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]], two laws were passed that reorganized the educational structure at al-Azhar. The first of these, in 1930, split the school into three departments: Arabic language, sharia, and theology, with each department located in buildings outside of the mosque throughout Cairo. Six years later, a second law was passed that moved the main office for the school to a newly constructed building across the street from the mosque. Additional structures were later added to supplement the three departmental buildings.<ref name=rabbat_63>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=63}}</ref>

===Post-revolution===
[[File:Gamal Nasser.jpg|thumb|left|Gamal Abdel Nasser, who led the Egyptian Revolution, instituted several reforms of al-Azhar]]

Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|coup]] led by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the [[Free Officers Movement]] that overthrew the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Egyptian monarchy]] in 1952, the university began to be separated from the mosque.<ref name=univ_hist_13>{{Harvnb|Summerfield|Devine|Levy|1998|p=13}}</ref><ref name=univ_hist_11 /> A number of properties that surrounded the mosque were acquired and demolished to provide space for a modern campus by 1955. The mosque itself would no longer serve as a school and the college itself was officially designated a university in 1961.<ref name=univ_hist_13 /><ref name=rabbat_63 /> The 1961 law separated the dual roles of the educational institution and the religious institution which made judgments heeded throughout the Muslim world.<ref name=abdo_50_51>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|pp=50-51}}</ref> The law also created secular departments within al-Azhar, such as colleges of medicine, engineering, and economics, furthering the efforts at modernization first seen following the French occupation.<ref name=zaman_60>{{Harvnb|Zaman|2002|p=60}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Harrison|Berger|2006|p=173}}</ref> The reforms of the curriculum have led to a massive growth in the number of Egyptian students attending al-Azhar run schools, specifically youths attending primary and secondary schools within the al-Azhar system. The number of students reported to attend al-Azhar primary and secondary schools has increased from under 90,000 in 1970 to 300,000 in the early in 1980s, up to nearly one million in the early 1990s, and exceeding 1.3 million students in 2001.<ref name=zaman_86>{{Harvnb|Zaman|2002|p=86}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hefner|Zaman|2007|p=110}}</ref>

Nasser continued the efforts to limit the power of the ''ulema'' of al-Azhar and to use its influence to his advantage. He abolished the ''sharia'' courts, merging religious courts with the state judicial system in 1955, severely limiting the independence of the ''ulema''. He also ordered that all mosques be placed under the newly created [[Ministry of Religious Endowments]], cutting off the ability of the mosque to control its financial affairs.<ref name=abdo_49_50>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|pp=49-50}}</ref> The 1961 reform law, which invalidated an earlier law passed in 1936 that had guaranteed the independence of al-Azhar, gave the President of Egypt the authority to appoint the ''sheikh al-Azhar'', a position first created during Ottoman rule and chosen from and by the ''ulema'' since its inception.<ref name=choueiri_79>{{Harvnb|Choueiri|2005|p=79}}</ref><ref name=lulat_79>{{Harvnb|Lulat|2005|p=79}}</ref> Al-Azhar, which remained a symbol of the Islamic character of both the nation and the state, continued to influence the population while being unable to exert its will over the state. Al-Azhar became increasingly co-opted into the state bureaucracy after the revolution <U+2014> independence of its curriculum and its function as a mosque ceased.<ref name=binder_340 /> The authority of the ''ulema'' was further weakened by the creation of government agencies responsible for providing interpretations of religious laws.<ref name=abdo_51>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|p=51}}</ref>

Al-Azhar, now fully integrated as an arm of the government, was then used to justify actions of the government. Although the ''ulema'' had in the past issued rulings that [[socialism]] is irreconcilable with Islam, following the revolution and Nasser's land reforms new rulings were supplied giving Nasser a religious justification for what he termed an "Islamic" socialism.<ref name=abdo_52>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|p=52}}</ref> The ''ulema'' would also serve as a counterweight to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and to Saudi Arabia's Wahabbi influence.<ref name=aburish_200>{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=200}}</ref> An assassination attempt on Nasser was blamed on the Brotherhood and the organization was outlawed. Nasser, needing support from the ''ulema'' as he initiated mass arrests of Brotherhood members, relaxed some of the restrictions placed on al-Azhar. The ''ulema'' of al-Azhar in turn consistently supported him in his attempts to dismantle the Brotherhood, and continued to do so in subsequent regimes.<ref name=abdo_51 /><ref name=shillington_478>{{Harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=478}}</ref> Despite the efforts of Nasser and al-Azhar to discredit the Brotherhood, the organization continued to function, and in recent years flourish.<ref name=aburish_88>{{Harvnb|Aburish|2004|p=88}}</ref> Al-Azhar also provided legitimacy for [[Six-Day War|war with Israel]] in 1967, declaring the conflict against Israel a "holy struggle."<ref name=abdo_31>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|p=31}}</ref>

Following Nasser's death in 1970, [[Anwar Sadat]] became President of Egypt. Sadat wished to restore al-Azhar as a symbol of Egyptian leadership throughout the Arab world, saying that "the Arab world cannot function without Egypt and its Azhar."<ref name=abdo_54>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|p=54}}</ref> Recognizing the growing influence of the Brotherhood, Sadat relaxed several restrictions on the organization and the ''ulema'' as a whole. However, in an abrupt about-face, a crackdown on journalists and organizations that the President felt were undermining or attacking his positions was launched in September 1971. As part of this effort to silence criticism of his policies, Sadat instituted sanctions against any of the ''ulema'' who criticized or contradicted official state policies. The ''ulema'' of al-Azhar continued to be used as a tool of the government, sparking criticism among several groups, including [[Islamism|Islamist]] and other more moderate groups.<ref name=abdo_31 /> [[Shukri Mustafa]], an influential Islamist figure, accused the ''ulema'' of providing religious judgments for the sole purpose of government convenience.<ref name=abdo_54 /> When Sadat needed support for making peace with Israel while the vast majority of the Egyptian population regarded that country as the enemy, al-Azhar provided a decree stating that the time had come to make peace.<ref name=abdo_31 />

Al-Azhar continues to hold a status above other Sunni religious authorities throughout the world, and as Sunnis form a large majority of the total Muslim population al-Azhar exerts considerable influence on the Islamic world as a whole. In addition to being the default authority within Egypt, al-Azhar has been looked to outside of Egypt for religious judgments. Prior to the [[Gulf War]], Saudi Arabia's [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] asked for a fatwa from authorizing the stationing of foreign troops within the kingdom, and despite Islam's two holiest sites being located within [[Saudi Arabia]], he asked the the head ''sheikh'' of al-Azhar instead of the [[grand mufti]] of Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Harrison|Berger|2006|p=165}}</ref> In 2003, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], at the time [[Minister of the Interior (France)|French Minister of the Interior]], requested a judgment from al-Azhar allowing Muslim girls to not wear the [[hijab]] in French public schools, despite the existence of the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|French Council of Islam]]. The ''sheikh'' of al-Azhar provided the ruling, saying that while wearing the hijab is an "Islamic duty" the Muslim women of [[France]] are obligated to respect and follow French laws. The ruling drew much criticism within Egypt as compromising Islamic principles to convenience the French government, and in turn the Egyptian government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hefner|Zaman|2007|p=123}}</ref>

==Architecture==
The architecture of al-Azhar is closely tied to the history of Cairo. Materials taken from multiple periods of Egyptian history, from the Ancient Egyptians through Greek and Roman rule to Coptic domination, were used in the early mosque structure, which drew on other Fatimid structures in [[Ifriqiya]].<ref name=rabbat_50 /> Later additions from the different rulers of Egypt likewise show influences from both within and outside of Egypt. Sections of the mosque show many of these influences blended together while others show a single inspiration, such as domes from the Ottoman period and minarets built by the Mamluks.<ref name=rabbat_45>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=45}}</ref> Initially built with a prayer hall with five aisles and a modest central courtyard, the mosque has since been expanded multiple times with additional installations completely surrounding the original structure.<ref name=rabbat_46 /> Many of Egypt's rulers have shaped the art and architecture of al-Azhar, from the minarets added by the Mamluks and the gates added during Ottoman rule to more recent renovations such as the installation of a new ''mihrab''.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 /> None of the original minarets or domes have survived, with some of the current minarets having been rebuilt several times.<ref name=islamic_arch_58>{{Harvnb|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|pp=58}}</ref><ref name=rabbat_51 />

===Current layout and structure===
[[Image:Al-Azhar Mihrab.jpg|thumb|Current ''mihrab'' and ''[[minbar]]'' in the main prayer hall]]
The present main entrance to the mosque is the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'', which opens into the the white marble-paved courtyard on the opposite end of the main prayer hall.<ref name=rabbat_46 /><ref name=beattie_103>{{Harvnb|Beattie|2005|p=103}}</ref> Northeast from the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'', the courtyard is flanked by the facade of the ''Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya''; the southwestern end of the courtyard leads to the ''Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya''.<ref name=rabbat_57 /> Directly across the courtyard from the entrance to the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'' is the ''Bab al-Gindi'' (Gate of Qaytbay), built in 1495, above which stands the minaret of Qaytbay.<ref name=rabbat_46 /> Through this gate is the court of the prayer hall.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 />

The ''mihrab'' has recently been changed to a plain marble facing with gold patterns.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 />

[[Image:Al-Azhar Interior.jpg|thumb||left|Prayer hall with columns used from various periods in Egyptian history]]
Ultimately a total of three domes were built, a common trait among early north African mosques, although none of them have survived Al-Azhar's many renovations.<ref name=behrens_59>{{Harvnb|Behrens-Abouseif|1992|p=59}}</ref><ref name=petersen_45>{{Harvnb|Petersen|2002|p=45}}</ref> The original ''[[mihrab]]'', uncovered in 1933, has a semi-dome above it with a marble column on either side.<ref name=rabbat_64 /> Intricate stucco decorations were a prominent feature of the mosque, with the ''mihrab'' and the walls ornately decorated.<ref name=yeomans_53>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=53}}</ref> The ''mihrab'' had two sets of verses from the [[Quran]] inscribed in the [[Conch (architecture)|conch]], which is still intact.

[[Image:Interior wall Azhar.JPG|thumb|Keel shaped arches along the courtyard wall with stucco ornaments inscribed]] 
The marble paved central courtyard was added between 1009 and 1010.<ref name=triumph_45>{{Harvnb|Abdo|2002|p=45}}</ref> The arcades that surround the courtyard have keel shaped arches with stucco inscriptions. The arches were built during the reign of [[Al-Hafiz|al-Hafiz li-Din Allah]].<ref name=rabbat_47>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=47}}</ref> The stucco ornaments also date to his rule and were redone in 1891.<ref name=rabbat_47 /> Two types of ornaments are used. The first appears above the center of the arch and consists of a sunken roundel and twenty-four lobes. A circular band of vegetal motifs was added in 1893. The second ornament used, which alternates with the first appearing in between each arch, consists of shallow niches below a fluted hood. The hood rests on [[engaged column]]s which are surronded by band of Qu'ranic writing in [[Kufic|Kufic script]]. The Qu'ranic script was added after the rule of al-Hafiz but during the Fatimid period.<ref name=rabbat_47 /> The walls are topped by a a star shaped band with tiered triangular [[crenellation]]s.<ref name=rabbat_47 />  The southeastern arcade of the courtyard contains the main entrance to the prayer hall. A Persian framing gate, in which the central arch of the arcade is further in with a higher rectangular pattern above it, opens into the prayer hall.<ref name=rabbat_47 />

A new wooden door was installed by al-Hakim in 1009; in 1125 al-Amir installed a new wooden ''mihrab''. Al-Hafiz li-Din Allah added a fourth arcade around the courtyard, as well as an additional dome.<ref name=behrens_59 />

===Mamluk additions===
[[Image:Cairo al-Azhar 1.jpg|thumb|Minaret above the ''Madrassa Aqbaghawiyya''. Originally built during Mamluk rule as part of a stand-alone mosque, the minaret was remodeled by Katkhuda during the Ottoman period]]
The Fatimid dynasty was succeeded by the rule of Saladin and his [[Ayyubid dynasty]]. Initially appointed [[vizier]] by the last Fatimid Caliph [[Al-'<U+0100><U+1E0D>id]] (who incorrectly thought he could be easily manipulated), Saladin consolidated power in Egypt, allying that country with the Sunni [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in Baghdad.<ref name=african_hist_438>{{Harvnb|Shillington|2005|p=438}}</ref> Distrusting al-Azhar for its Shia history, the mosque lost prestige during his rule.<ref name=univ_hist_10 /> However, the succeeding Mamluk dynasty made restorations and additions to the mosque, overseeing a rapid expansion of its educational programs.<ref name=petry_312>{{Harvnb|Petry|1998|p=312}}</ref> Among the restorations was a modification of the ''mihrab'', with the installation of a polychrome marble facing.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 />

The ''Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya'', which contains the tomb of Amir Taybars, was built in 1309.<ref name=yeomans_56>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=56}}</ref><ref name=cambridge_hist_731>{{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|p=731}}</ref> Originally intended to function as complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated with the rest of the mosque.<ref name=rabbat_57>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=57}}</ref> The [[Maliki]] and [[Sh<U+0101>fi<U+2018><U+012B>]] [[madh'hab]] were studied in this ''madrasa'', though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving piece from the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome ''mihrab''.<ref name=yeomans_56 />

A dome and minaret cover the ''Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya'', which contains the tomb of [[Amir Aqbugha]], which was built in 1339.<ref name=yeomans_56 /> Intended by its founder, Aqbugha 'Abd al-Wahid, to be a stand-alone mosque and school, the ''madrasa'' has since become integrated with the rest of the mosque.<ref name=rabbat_46 /> The  entrance, qibla wall, and glass mosaic in the ''mihrab'' are all original with the dome dating to the Ottoman period.<ref name=yeomans_56 />

Built in 1440,<ref name=cambridge_hist_731 /> the ''Madrasa Gawhariyya'' contains the tomb of Gawhar al-Qanaqba'i, a Sudanese [[eunuch]] who became treasurer to the sultan.<ref name=yeomans_56 /> The floor of the ''madrasa'' is marble, the walls lined with cupboards, decoratively inlaid with ebony, ivory, and [[nacre]]. The tomb chamber is covered by small arabesque dome.<ref name=yeomans_56 />

====Minaret of Qaytbay====
[[File:Minaret of Qaytbay.jpg|thumb|left|Minaret of Qaytbay]]
Built in 1483 with two octagonal and one cylindrical shafts, the Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by ''[[muqarnas]]'',<ref name=yeomans_55>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=55}}</ref> a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one<ref name=petersen_208>{{Harvnb|Petersen|2002|p=208}}</ref> (first recorded to have been used in Egypt in 1085),<ref name=bloom_21>{{Harvnb|Bloom|1988|p=21}}</ref> that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel.<ref name=yeomans_55 /> Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting.<ref name=yeomans_55 /> A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the [[finial]] top of the minaret.<ref name=yeomans_55 />

The minaret is believed to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times,<ref name=rabbat_51>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=51}}</ref> including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the ''qadi al-qudat'' (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars.<ref name=rabbat_50>{{Harvnb|Rabbat|1996|p=50}}</ref> Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began to lean at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the ''[[wali|wal<U+012B>]]'' and ''[[muhtasib]]'' of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.<ref name=rabbat_51 />

=====Bab al-Gindi=====
Directly across the courtyard from the entrance from the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'' is the ''Bab al-Gindi'' (Gate of Qaytbay). Built in 1495, this gate leads to the court of the prayer hall.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 />

====Ghuri minaret====
[[File:Ghuri Minaret.jpg|right|Double finial minaret of Qansah al-Ghuri|thumb|left|Double finial minaret of Qansah al-Ghuri]]
The double finial minaret was built in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri.<ref name=rabbat_47_48 /> Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a decorative keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns.<ref name=yeomans_55 /> The second shaft, separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas, is also octagonal and decorated with blue [[faience]]. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level is made up of two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.<ref name=yeomans_55 />

===Ottoman renovations and additions===
Several additions and restorations were made during Ottoman reign in Egypt, many of which were completed under the direction of Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda who nearly doubled the size of the mosque.<ref name=yeomans_54 /> Three gates were added by Katkhuda, the ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'' (Gate of the Barbers), which became the main entrance to the mosque, the ''Bab al-Shurba'' (the Soup Gate), from which food, often rice soup, would be served to the students, and the ''Bab al-Sa'ayida'' (Gate of the [[Sa'idi]]s), named for the people of [[Upper Egypt]].<ref name=rabbat_49_50 /> Several ''riwaqs'' were added, including one for the blind students of al-Azhar, as well as refurbished during the Ottoman period.<ref name=rabbat_60_61 /> Katkhuda also added an additional prayer hall south of the original Fatimid hall, with an additional ''mihrab'', doubling the total prayer area.<ref name=yeomans_54>{{Harvnb|Yeomans|2006|p=54}}</ref><ref name=rabbat_60_61 />

=====Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n=====
[[Image:Bab al-Muzaynin.jpg|thumb|left|''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'' (Gate of the Barbers)]]
The ''Bab al-Muzayin<U+012B>n'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0628><U+0627><U+0628> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0632><U+064A><U+0646><U+064A><U+0646>}}, "Gate of the Barbers"), so named because students would have their heads shaved outside of the gate, was built in 1753.<ref name=medievel_cairo_185>{{Harvnb|Russell|1962|p=185}}</ref><ref name=gottheil>{{Harvnb|Gottheil|1907|p=503}}</ref> Credited to Katkhuda the gate has two doors, each surrounded by recessed arches. Two moulded semi-circular arches with tumpanums decorated with trefoils are above the doors. Above the arches is a frieze with panels of cypress trees, a common trait of Ottoman work.<ref name=rabbat_46 />

A free-standing minaret, built by Katkhuda, originally stood outside the gate. The minaret was demolished prior to the opening of al-Azhar street by Tewfik Pasha during modernization efforts which took place throughout Cairo.<ref name=rabbat_62 />

|{{note|oldest}}The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] is the oldest mosque in modern Cairo (as well as the oldest mosque in Africa), built in 642 CE. However, this mosque, as well as several others in modern Cairo that are older than al-Azhar, was built in the city of [[Fustat]]. Cairo has expanded and now includes Fustat within its borders.
