'''Battery Park''' is a 25-acre (10 hectare) public park located at the Battery, the southern tip of [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]], facing [[New York Harbor]]. The Battery is named for the [[artillery battery]] that was stationed there at various times by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] in order to protect the settlements behind it.  At the north end of the park is Pier A, formerly a fireboat station and [[Hope Garden]], a memorial to [[AIDS]] victims.  At the other end is Battery Gardens restaurant, next to the United States Coast Guard Battery Building.  Along the waterfront, [[ferry|ferries]] depart for the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Ellis Island]].  There is also a stop on the [[New York Water Taxi]] route between the Statue of Liberty Ferry and Pier A.

To the northwest of the park lies [[Battery Park City]], a planned community built on landfill in the 1970s and 80s, which includes Robert F. Wagner Park and the Battery Park City Promenade.  Together with [[Hudson River Park]], a system of greenspaces, bikeways and promenades now extend up the [[Hudson River|Hudson shoreline]]. A bikeway is being built through the park that will connect the Hudson River and East River parts of the [[Manhattan Waterfront Greenway]].  Across State Street to the northeast stands the old [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House|U.S. Customs House]], now used as a branch of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and the district U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Peter Minuit Plaza abuts the southeast end of the park, directly in front of the [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]] Terminal of the [[Staten Island Ferry]].

==History==
The southern shoreline of [[Manhattan Island]] had long been known as the Battery, and was a popular [[promenade]] since at least the 17th century. At the time, it served as protection to the town.<ref>http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Wonder-Book-Of-Knowledge/Why-Is-It-Called-Battery-Park.html</ref> The Battery was the center of [[Evacuation Day (New York)|Evacuation Day]] celebrations commemorating the departure of the last British troops in the United States after the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The relatively modern [[park]] was created by [[land reclamation|landfill]] during the 19th century, resulting in a landscaped open space at the foot of the heavily developed mainland of downtown. [[Skyscraper]]s now occupy most of the original land, stopping abruptly where the park begins. On State Street, the former harbor front and the northern boundary of the park, a single Federal mansion survives (''illustration, right'') as the Shrine of Saint [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]]. Until the 1820s, the city's stylish residential district lay north of this house, between Broadway and the "[[North River (Hudson River)|North River]]" (now known as the Hudson River).

Within the park lies [[Castle Clinton]], an American fort built on a small artificial off-shore [[island]] immediately prior to the [[War of 1812]] and named for mayor [[DeWitt Clinton]]. When the land of Battery Park was created, it enclosed the island.

The fort became property of the city after the war and was renamed [[Castle Garden]]. Leased by the city it became a popular [[promenade]] and [[beer garden]].  Later roofed-over, it became one of the premier [[American theater|theatrical]] venues in the United States and contributed greatly to the development of New York City as the theater capital of the nation.  The migration of the city's elite uptown increased concurrently with the mass European emigration of the middle 19th century.  As [[immigrants]] settled the Battery area, the location was less favorable to theater patrons and Castle Garden was closed.  The structure was then made into the world's first immigration depot, processing millions of immigrants beginning in 1855 - almost 40 years before its successor, [[Ellis Island]], opened its doors.  This period coincided with immigration waves resulting from the [[Great Hunger]] in [[Ireland]] (a.k.a., "The Irish Famine") and other pivotal European events. The structure then housed the [[New York Aquarium]] until the 1940s, when it was threatened with destruction.  It is currently a [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]] known again by its original name, and managed by the [[National Park Service]].  In addition to a small history exhibit and occasional concerts, the fort is the site where ferry tickets are sold to visit Liberty and Ellis islands.

The Battery is featured in the famous [[show tune]] from the musical ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'', "[[New York, New York (On The Town)|New York, New York]]," which includes the line "<U+2026> the Bronx is up and the Battery's down" for its southerly location.  It is also mentioned in [[John Mayer|John Mayer's]] song "City Love," which includes the lyric "From the Battery to the Gallery" in reference to the entirety of [[Manhattan Island]] as well as the lyric "<U+2026> from the Battery to the top of Manhattan" in The Beastie Boys anthem "Open Letter to NYC".

Five months after being damaged but not destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], [[Fritz Koenig]]'s ''[[The Sphere]]'', which once stood at the center of the plaza of the [[World Trade Center]] a few blocks away, was reinstalled in a temporary location along Eisenhower Mall in the northern section of the park. There, along with an [[eternal flame]], it serves to memorialize the victims of 9/11. Following the completion of the [[National September 11 Memorial]], ''The Sphere'' will be returned to its original location.

==Under Battery Park==

Battery Park, due to its key location, has played an important role in the construction of transportation infrastructure.  Under the park, there is the following active infrastructure:

* [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]], carrying vehicular traffic to [[Brooklyn]]
* [[Battery Park Underpass]], carrying vehicular traffic from [[West Street]] to the [[FDR Drive]]
* [[IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line]] and [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]] with a [[balloon loop]] to enable trains to turn around and switch between the two [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] lines
* [[South Ferry<U+2013>Whitehall Street (IRT Broadway<U+2013>Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] subway complex.

===The discovered wall===

On December 8, 2005, New York City authorities announced that builders working on a new [[South Ferry<U+2013>Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry Subway Station]] in Battery Park had found the remains of a 200-year-old stone wall.<ref>http://www.archaeologydaily.com/news/201002263403/Unearthing-colonial-New-York-South-Ferry-project-yields-65K-artifacts.html</ref>

"This wall most likely is a portion of the [[artillery battery|gun batteries]] that once protected the city in the late 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to the modern park name," said Robert Tierney, chairman of the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]. The city and the [[New York City Transit Authority]] plan to work together to preserve the remains, which were described as "an important remnant of the history of New York City."

A total of four distinct walls and over 250,000 individual artifacts were found in the excavation of the [[South Ferry<U+2013>Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry Station and Tunnel]].  A portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside [[Castle Clinton]].
