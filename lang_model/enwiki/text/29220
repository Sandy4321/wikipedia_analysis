{{nihongo|'''''Sonic X'''''|<U+30BD><U+30CB><U+30C3><U+30AF>X|Sonikku Ekkusu}} is a [[Japan|Japanese]] [[anime]] that is adapted from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] video game series. It was produced in [[Japan]] by [[Tokyo Movie Shinsha|TMS Entertainment]] with the partnership of [[Sonic Team]]. It was the longest running Sonic series at 3 years.

== Plot synopsis ==
=== Series 1 (Seasons 1-2) ===
During a mission to rescue [[Cream the Rabbit]] and [[Cheese the Chao]] from [[Dr. Eggman]]'s headquarters, Sonic and his friends are caught in [[Chaos Control|an explosion]] that transports them to what seems to be another dimension. Sonic's life is eventually saved from drowning by a twelve year old boy named [[Chris Thorndyke|Christopher Thorndyke]]. Chris lives in a mansion owned by his two celebrity parents with his inventor grandfather. Chris aids Sonic in locating his friends, and it is not long before Dr. Eggman reappears. Sonic and Eggman race to collect all the [[Chaos Emeralds]] in the first 26 episodes and eventually, all of the Chaos Emeralds are retrieved and [[Chaos Control]] warped parts of their home to Earth (like [[Angel Island]]). The rest of the season features plots based on the ''Sonic'' games. In the end, Chris' grandfather invents a portal to send Sonic and everything else from his world. Before he leaves, Chris kidnaps him because he does not want Sonic to abandon him like his parents did. Eventually, Chris comes to terms with his feelings and Sonic returns to his own dimension.

=== Series 2 (Season 3) ===
[[Image:Season3pan.jpg|thumb|right|Left to right: Tails, Amy, Knuckles, Sonic, Cosmo, Cream and Cheese.]]It has been years since Sonic and friends returned to their dimension. Chris is now eighteen and has been working on repairing his grandfather's dimensional portal. A plant being named Cosmo arrives on Sonic's planet, looking for the one who can wield the powers of the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic, having been nearly defeated by a new enemy called [[List of Sonic X characters#Metarex|Dark Oak]], scatters the Chaos Emeralds across the galaxy to prevent Dark Oak from using their power. When Chris uses the portal, he suddenly finds himself in Sonic's world. His age has reversed back to the age when he met Sonic. However, Chris still has all his memories of the years since. To Sonic, only six months had passed. During their reunion, Dark Oak and his [[List of Sonic X characters#Metarex|Metarex]] army (similar to the Black Arms from the ''Sonic'' games) attack steal the "Planet Egg" from Sonic's planet. Without the Egg, all the plants on the planet wither. Once again, Sonic and friends venture into space to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds. After many run-ins with Dr. Eggman and the pursuing Metarex, Cosmo is eventually unveiled as an unwilling spy for the Metarex, who are part of the same race of anthropomorphic plants that Cosmo from. When the Metarex enact a plan that could destroy the universe, Cosmo sacrifices herself with the help of Super Sonic and Super Shadow, and her essence is manifested in the form of a seed. With Metarex destroyed, Eggman helps Chris to be sent back home. Soon thereafter, Dr. Eggman revives his previous rivalry with Sonic, albeit a light-hearted one.

== American version ==
{{see|4Kids_Entertainment#Editorial_practices.2C_criticism.2C_and_controversy}}
In 2003, [[4Kids Entertainment]] and [[VIZ Media]] co-licensed ''Sonic X'' for the United States, with the series being distributed by [[FUNimation]]. The episodes were then localized for the intended demographic, including the complete replacement of the score, as well as removing suggestive content and changing the fate of several characters. For example, [[Other characters in Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Maria Robotnik|Maria Robotnik]] is originally killed aboard the Space Colony ARK, while in the edited version, she is merely captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteanime.com/sonic_x/maria.htm|title=Character Profile: Maria Robotnik|publisher=Absolute Anime|accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref> Her death remains intact in the video games where the series was adapted from.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowshq.org/main.php?id=ps_geraldbio.htm|title=Gerald's Bio|publisher=Shadows HQ|accessdate=2008-01-27}}</ref> Other continuity errors include mislabelling "[[Chaos Control]]" as [[Doctor Eggman]]'s base. While both English and Japanese characters were digitally removed or replaced with incoherent symbols, Chinese characters were unedited in ''The Adventures of Knuckles and Hawk'', in coherence with the episode's setting.

4Kids did not cast the voice actors from the ''Sonic'' games and went with their in-house VAs. [[Mike Pollock]], the current voice actor for Doctor Eggman, stated during an interview that he was provided samples of the game's voiceovers as a reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fireball20xl.com/wha-chow/pollock.mp3|title=Episode 42 - The Doctor Is In|publisher=Wha-CHOW!|accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> However, when a producer for the series was asked about any prior experience with the ''Sonic'' franchise, he replied, "I've never played the game, seen the series or read the comics."<ref name="AnimeBoredom ScriptInter">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeboredom.co.uk/anime-articles/80/|title=Mr. Michael Haigney Interview (4Kids)|publisher=Anime Boredom|date=[[2006-02-12]]|accessdate=2008-01-30|last=Rasmussen|first=David}}</ref> After the passing of [[Deem Bristow]], the voice actor for Eggman in the previous games, the 4Kids VAs were recast for ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'' and subsequent ''Sonic'' games.

== Theme songs ==
For the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Latin America]], much of [[Europe]], and [[Brazil]], the opening song was performed by a female singer repeating the show's title numerous times, the U.S. ending theme was kept, however, and all of the inserts were edited out of the English version.
