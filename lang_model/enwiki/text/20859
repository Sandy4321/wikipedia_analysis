== Setting ==
===Series 1: FushigiBoshi===
[[Image:Fushigiboshi.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The structure of ''Fushigi-boshi'']]
''Fushigi-boshi'' is a hollow planet that has all of its inhabitants living in its interior. The story is set within the ''Ohisama no Kuni'' (<U+304A><U+3072><U+3055><U+307E><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of the sun) that governs the floating sun at the center of the planet called ''Ohisama no Megumi'' (the blessing of the sun). Periodical rotations of ''Ohisama no Kuni'' bring to the inhabitants of the planet days and nights as it shines on one side only. 

On the surface of the interior of the planet, there are other six kingdoms. These kingdoms each share a duty:

* ''Tsuki no Kuni'' (<U+6708><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of the moon) controls nights and watches ''Hoshi no Izumi'' (Spring of Stars) which is a gateway to outer space.
* ''Mera-Mera no Kuni'' (<U+30E1><U+30E9><U+30E1><U+30E9><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of flames) changes "Ohisama no Megumi" into heat and keeps the temperature constant.
* ''Shizuku no Kuni'' (<U+3057><U+305A><U+304F><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of water drops) makes clouds and rain with heat.
* ''Tane-Tane no Kuni'' (<U+30BF><U+30CD><U+30BF><U+30CD><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of seeds) produces plants from rain from the Mother Tree.
* ''Kazaguruma no Kuni'' (<U+304B><U+3056><U+3050><U+308B><U+307E><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of windmills) transports other kingdoms' products by using the wind.
* ''Hoseki no Kuni'' (<U+5B9D><U+77F3><U+306E><U+56FD><U+3000>the kingdom of jewels) makes ornaments for morale.

Fushigiboshi only takes place during the 1st season. Futago Hime Gyu! (2nd season) takes place in another world called Gakkouboshi, meaning school star.

===Series 2: Royal Wonder Academy===

''The Royal Wonder Academy'' is a specialized prestigious institution for princesses and princes from all over the universe. If they complete the school and earn their diploma, they can gain rights to become king and queen of their planet. This school happens to be a boarding school, much like Hogwarts Castle from [[Harry Potter]]. This school also has very strict rules and tough guidelines that all students must follow. Lastly, evaluation is based on the point scale. If the student's point value reaches 100, the person is allowed to promote to the next level. On the contrary, if the student's point value reaches -100, the person is expelled from school. Point records are kept in little notebooks. First Years start at 10.

==Story==
===Futago Hime (Series 1)===
Seven royal families reign over each of the seven kingdoms, and they have continued prospering inside the planet for a long time. However, ''Ohisama no Megumi'' or the internal [[star]] is beginning to die, and it was forecasted that it will disappear in one year. If it disappears, all of the planet will be ruined. Twin princesses Fine and Rein receive a secret mission from Grace to investigate the reason of this degrading of the star. Using the power of the Prominence, they can have hope to rescue the ''Ohisama no Megumi''. Later on their investigation, an evil chancellor named Roman becomes too interested in the power of the Prominence that he steals the Prominence for his own good. After he unleashes the ultimate enemy, the entire storyline changes.

Later in the series, Prince Bright becomes evil under the powers of the darkness and Boomo. His attempt is to rule the entire FushigiBoshi under the powers of evil. During this period, Fine and Rein, along with other people investigate the causes of evil and Boomo.

===Futago Hime Gyu! (Series 2)===
Fine and Rein as well as the other princesses leave FushigiBoshi to attend the Royal Wonder Academy of Education. This prestigious institution is the school where Princes and Princesses from all of the planets come to receive their certification to become Kings and Queens. Upon arrival to school, Fine and Rein's unprincess-like actions cause them to violate school regulations. As a punishment, Fine and Rein lose points for their wrongdoing. During the orientation of 1st-Year students, the vice-principal presents a legendary bell that will only ring when a certain person touches it. If the bell rings, the person is classified to be the "Universal Princess". No princess has ever rang the before until this very day. 

Toma, the new president of the student advisory, opposes friendship and happiness in the school. When something happy approaches, he sends in monsters to enforce his thought.

* '''Grand Universal Princess!''' - This transformation is similar to Universal Princess except that PyuPyu and KyuKyu touch their rods instead of their necklace. Fine and Rein's dresses have more details than Univeral Princess.

==Princess Levels==
In Futago Hime, there are Princess Levels for Fine and Rein. These levels measure the amount of experience Fine and Rein has with their Prominence. Their main goal is to earn Level Ups so that they can get Level 5: Eternal Solar Princess, the highest Level. Princess Grace awards a Level Up to Fine and Rein when the Star Vial fills to the top and turns gold (Princess Levels 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4). Fine and Rein got Princess Level 4-5 from Princess Grace directly.

In Futago Hime Gyu! Fine and Rein are Universal Princesses from episode 1-26 and are Grand Universal Princessess from episode 27 and on.

===Futago Hime (Series 1 - Only)===
* '''Level 1: Shobotto Princess''' - This is the 1st level. Fine and Rein only have 10% of the Princesses' power with this Level. It is featured from Episode 1 to 5.
* '''Level 2: Chika-Chika Princess''' - This is the 2nd level. Fine and Rein did not stay at this level too long. This Princess Level is featured from Episode 6 to 9.
* '''Level 3: Kira-Kira Princess''' (Shiny Princess) - This is the 3rd level. For most of the episodes, Fine and Rein stayed at this level. This is also the level when the power of the Prominence was stolen. This Level is featured from Episode 10-27.
* '''Level 4: Fortune Princess''' - This is the 4th level. This level is when many procedures change. Fine and Rein earn the Crystal Fortulatte and lose the Star Vial. Also, their Transformation Procedures and Attacks become different from the previous three. This Level is featured from Episode 28-36.
* '''Level 5: Eternal Solar Princess''' - This is the 5th and final level. At this level, Fine and Rein wear different dresses at the end of their Transformation. The Transformation Procedures and Attacks are also different. At this level, Fine and Rein have completed their training and are working towards their main mission. This level is featured from Episode 38 and on.

==Attacks==
In the beginning, most of the these attacks are intended to help other people and themselves. That was a task that Princess Grace had Fine and Rein do. Later attacks can be classified as direct attacks to defeat enemies.

===Futago Hime (Series 1)===
* '''Twinkle Bloomish''' - This is the only single-person Prominence attack, also called "Hitori Prominence". Fine or Rein says "Daruma-san ga Koronda" to freeze objects or "Kakurenbo Shimashou" to turn invisible. This prominence can be used single but has a lighter effect than the other prominences. Time is limited with this prominence.
* '''Twin Twinkle Bloomish''' (Princess Levels 1,2, and 3) - This attack releases many stars. The stars would form together to make something that relates to the problem. Fine and Rein have to brainstorm what to do with the item to solve the problem. 
* '''Twinkle Fortune Bloomish''' (Princess Level 4) - This is the 2nd attack. This attack is more direct than the previous Prominence; however, it stands short against Bright's Dark Prominence.
* '''Twinkle Eternal Solar Bloomish''' (Princess Level 5) - This is the 3rd and most powerful attack. This attack is stronger than Twinkle Fortune Bloomish and sends an ultimate deal of damage at Bright's evil use of the Dark Prominence.
* '''Final Prominence'''- This attack is simply Twinkle Eternal Solar Bloomish used in conjunction with powerful Grace Stones.
* '''Myuugram de dancing''' - This attack is not done by transformation. Instead, Fine or Rein presses one of the three buttons on the Myuugram to make it play music. Anyone standing in front of the Muugram will be forced to dance depending on the music the Myuugram plays. There is one secret music hidden inside the Feather Myuugram.

===Futago Hime Gyu! (Series 2)===
*'''Fararira!'''-This is Fine's single-person attack with Happy Bellun. It can wipe out small enemies at a time. Fine's Happy Bellun rings with a different sound from Rein's.
*'''Rararira!'''-This is Rein's single-person attack with Happy Bellun. It can wipe out small enemies at a time. Rein's Happy Bellun rings with a different sound from Fine's.

===Futago Hime (Series 1)===
* '''Decor Maker''' - This family heirloom of the Sunny Kingdom allows Fine and Rein to make the prettiest decorations.
* '''Sunny Luche''' - This round device lets Fine and Rein transform into their Prominence form. In the beginning, they spin the dial and call out their names. In the later episodes, they call out the Crystal Fortulatte to transform. They can also call out the Crystal Fortulatte for other purposes.
