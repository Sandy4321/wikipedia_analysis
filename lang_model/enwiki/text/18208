'''Andrew Johnson''' (December 29, 1808 &ndash; July 31, 1875) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|17th]] [[President of the United States]] (1865&ndash;1869). Following the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|assassination of President Lincoln]], Johnson presided over the immediate [[Reconstruction Era|aftermath of the American Civil War]].

At the time of the [[Ordinance of Secession|secession of the Southern states]], Johnson was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] in [[East Tennessee|East]] [[Tennessee]]. As a Unionist, he was the only southern senator not to quit his post upon secession. He became the most prominent [[War Democrat]] from the South and supported the military policies of U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]] of 1861&ndash;1865. In 1862, Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee, where he proved to be energetic and effective in fighting the rebellion and beginning transition to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].<ref name="Britanica1">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9043849/Andrew-Johnson 'Andrew Johnson'], [[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]</ref>

Johnson was nominated for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] position in 1864 on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] ticket. He and Lincoln were [[United States presidential election, 1864|elected in November 1864]]. Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.

As president, he took charge of Presidential Reconstruction{{ndash}} the first phase of Reconstruction {{ndash}} which lasted until the [[Radical Republicans]] gained control of Congress in the 1866 elections. His conciliatory policies towards the South, his hurry to reincorporate the former Confederate states back into the union, and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with some Republicans.<ref>{{cite book |title=American Legal History |last=Hall |first=Kermit |coauthors=Paul Finkelman, James W. Ely |year=2005 |edition=3rd |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-516225-0 |pages=259<U+2013>260 }}</ref> The Radicals in the [[History of the United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] impeached him in 1868, charging him with violating the [[Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, but he was acquitted by a single vote in the [[History of the United States Senate|Senate]].

While Johnson is the most recent president to represent a party other than the Republican or Democratic parties, having represented both the Democrats and the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]], his party status was ambiguous during his presidency. As president, he did not identify with the two main parties&mdash;though he did try for the Democratic nomination in 1868&mdash;and so while President he attempted to build a party of loyalists under the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] label. Asked in 1868 why he did not become a Democrat, he said, "It is true I am asked why don't I join the Democratic Party. Why don't they join me ... if I have administered the office of president so well?" His failure to make the National Union brand an actual party made Johnson effectively an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] during his presidency, though he was supported by Democrats and later rejoined the party as a Democratic Senator from Tennessee from 1875 until his death of a stroke at 66.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/anjo/forteachers/curriculummaterials.htm National Park Service Questionnaire ]</ref> For these reasons he is usually counted as a Democrat when identifying presidents by their political parties.<ref>Trefousse, Hans Louis. ''Andrew Johnson: A Biography'' (1997), p. 338<U+2013>339.</ref>

Johnson was the first [[Impeachment in the United States|U.S. President to be impeached]]. He is commonly ranked by historians as being [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|among the worst U.S. presidents]].

==Early life==
[[File:Andrew Johnsons First Home 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Johnson's boyhood home in [[North Carolina]], located at the [[Mordecai House|Mordecai Square Historic Park]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].]]
Johnson was born on December 29, 1808, in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], to [[Jacob Johnson (father of Andrew Johnson)|Jacob Johnson]] (1778<U+2013>1812) and Mary McDonough (1783<U+2013>1856). Jacob died when Andrew was around three years old, leaving his family in poverty. Johnson's mother then took in work [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[weaving]] to support her family, and she later remarried. She bound Andrew as an apprentice tailor when he was 10 or 14 years old.<ref>14 according to ''Britannica'', 10 according to Karin L Zipf</ref>  In the 1820s, he worked as a tailor in [[Laurens, South Carolina]].<ref>[http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?MarkerID=10133 Laurens Historic District historical marker]</ref> Johnson had no formal education and taught himself how to read and write.<ref name="Britanica1"/>

At age 16 or 17, Johnson left his [[apprenticeship]] and ran away with his brother to [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], where he found work as a tailor.<ref name="Britanica1"/><ref>Karin L Zipf. ''Labor Of Innocents: Forced Apprenticeship in North Carolina, 1715<U+2013>1919'' (2005) pp 8<U+2013>9</ref> At the age of 18, Johnson married [[Eliza McCardle Johnson|Eliza McCardle]] in 1827. Between 1828 and 1852, the couple had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852).<ref name="timeline"/>  Eliza taught Johnson arithmetic up to basic algebra and tutored him to improve his literacy and writing skills.<ref name="Britanica1"/><br clear="left"/><!-- for boyhood home photo -->

==Early political career==
Johnson participated in debates at the local academy at Greeneville, Tennessee<ref name="whitehouse1">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/aj17.html Biography of Andrew Johnson]{{ndash}} www.whitehouse.gov</ref> and later organized a worker's party that elected him as [[alderman]] in 1829. He served in this position until he was elected mayor in 1833.<ref name="Britanica1"/> In 1835, he was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] where, after serving a single term, he was defeated for re-election.<ref name="timeline">{{cite web |url=http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/?page_id=6|title=The Andrew Johnson Collection|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070607123406/http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/ajcollect.html |archivedate=2007-06-07}} [http://www2.tusculum.edu/ajmuseum/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/timeline_master.pdf Timeline of President Andrew Johnson's Life (PDF)] from the Web site of the president [http://ajmuseum.tusculum.edu/ Andrew Johnson Museum and Library] at [[Tusculum College]]</ref>

Johnson was attracted to the states' rights Democratic Party of [[Andrew Jackson]]. He became a spokesman for the more numerous yeomen farmers and mountaineers against the wealthier, but fewer, planter elite families that had held political control both in the state and nationally.<ref name="Britanica1"/><ref name="whitehouse1"/> In 1839, Johnson was elected to a second, non-consecutive term in the Tennessee House, and was elected to the [[Tennessee Senate]] in 1841, where he served one two-year term.<ref name="timeline"/><ref name="CongBio">{{CongBio|J000116}}</ref> In 1843, he became the first Democrat to win election as the U.S. representative from [[Tennessee's 1st congressional district]]. Among his activities for the common man's interests as a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Johnson advocated 'a free farm for the poor' bill, in which farms would be given to landless farmers.<ref name="whitehouse1"/> Johnson was a U.S. representative for five terms until 1853, when he was elected governor of Tennessee.<ref name="timeline"/>

==Political ascendancy==
[[File:Younger Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] photo of Johnson.]]
Johnson was elected governor of Tennessee, serving from 1853 to 1857. He was then elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving from October 8, 1857&nbsp;<U+2013> March 4, 1862. He was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense ([[36th United States Congress|Thirty-sixth Congress]]). As a U.S. senator, he continued to push for the [[Homestead Act]]. It finally passed in 1862, after the Civil War had begun and Southerners had resigned from Congress.

As the slavery question became more critical, Johnson continued to take a middle course. He opposed the antislavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] guaranteed the right to own slaves. He supported President Buchanan's administration. He also approved the [[Lecompton Constitution]] proposed by proslavery settlers in Kansas. At the same time, he made it clear that his devotion to the Union exceeded his devotion to right to own slaves.

Johnson's stand in favor of both the Union and the right to own slaves might have made him a logical compromise candidate for president. However, he was not nominated in 1856 because of a split within the Tennessee delegation. In 1860, the Tennessee delegation nominated Johnson for president at the Democratic National Convention, but when the convention and the party broke up, he withdrew from the race. In the election, Johnson supported Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, the candidate of most Southern Democrats.<ref>[[World Book]]</ref>

Before Tennessee voted on secession, Johnson, who lived in Unionist East Tennessee, toured the state speaking in opposition to the act, which he said was unconstitutional. Johnson was an aggressive stump speaker and often responded to hecklers, even those in the Senate. At the time of the [[secession]] of [[Tennessee]], Johnson was the only Senator from the seceded states to continue participation in Congress. His explanation for this decision was "Damn the negroes, I am fighting those traitorous aristocrats, their masters."<ref name="Britanica1"/>

Lincoln appointed Johnson military governor of occupied Tennessee in March 1862 with the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].<ref name="Britanica1"/> During his three years in this office, he "moved resolutely to eradicate all pro-Confederate influences in the state." This "unwavering commitment to the Union" was a significant factor in his choice as vice president by Lincoln.<ref>Sledge pg. 1071<U+2013>1072</ref>  Johnson vigorously suppressed the Confederates and later spoke out for black suffrage, arguing, "The better class of them will go to work and sustain themselves, and that class ought to be allowed to vote, on the ground that a loyal [[negro]] is more worthy than a disloyal white man."<ref>Patton p 126</ref> According to tradition and local lore, on August 8, 1863, Johnson freed his personal slaves.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12586299 "Tennessee Recalls Emancipation, Segregation"], National Public Radio</ref>

==Vice presidency==
[[File:Republican presidential ticket 1864b.jpg|thumb|[[Currier and Ives]] print of the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] presidential and vice presidential candidates, 1864.  Lithograph and watercolor.]]
As a leading [[War Democrat]] and pro-Union southerner, Johnson was an ideal candidate for the Republicans in 1864 as they enlarged their base to include War Democrats. They changed the party name to the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] to reflect this expansion. During the election, Johnson replaced [[Hannibal Hamlin]] as Lincoln's running mate. He was elected [[vice president of the United States]] and was inaugurated March 4, 1865. At the ceremony, Johnson, who had been drinking to offset the pain of [[typhoid fever]] (as he explained later), gave a rambling speech and appeared intoxicated to many. According to Senator [[Zachariah Chandler]], he "disgraced himself and the Senate by making a drunken foolish speech."<ref>[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/andrew_johnson.pdf]</ref> In early 1865, Johnson talked harshly of hanging traitors like [[Jefferson Davis]], which endeared him to radicals.<ref>Trefousse p. 198</ref>

On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was  [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|shot and mortally wounded]] by [[John Wilkes Booth]], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer, while the president was attending a play at [[Ford's Theater]]. Booth's plan was to destroy the administration by ordering conspirators to assassinate Johnson, lieutenant general of the Union army Ulysses S. Grant, and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] that night. Grant survived when he failed to attend the theater with Lincoln as planned, Seward narrowly survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, [[George Atzerodt]], failed to go through with the plan.

On April 15, 1865, the morning after Lincoln's assassination, Johnson was sworn in as President of the United States by the newly appointed [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Salmon P. Chase]]. Johnson was the first vice president to succeed to the presidency upon the [[assassination]] of a president and the third vice president to become a president upon the death of a sitting president.<ref name="whitehouse1"/><ref>[http://australianpolitics.com/usa/president/presidents-list.shtml Complete list of U.S. presidents]</ref>

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era of the United States}}
[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|thumb|A political cartoon of Andrew Johnson and Abraham Lincoln, 1865. The caption reads (Johnson to the former rail-splitter): ''Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever!!'' (Lincoln to the former tailor): ''A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended!'']]
Northern anger over the assassination of Lincoln and the immense human cost of the war led to demands for harsh policies. Vice President Andrew Johnson had taken a hard line and spoke of hanging rebel Confederates. In late April, 1865, he was noted telling an Indiana delegation that, "Treason must be made odious ... traitors must be punished and impoverished ... their social power must be destroyed." However, when he succeeded Lincoln as president, Johnson took a much softer line, commenting, "I say, as to the leaders, punishment. I also say leniency, reconciliation and amnesty to the thousands whom they have misled and deceived,"<ref>Milton 183</ref> and ended up pardoning many Confederate leaders.<ref>Trefousse, Hans L. Andrew Johnson: A Biography (1989)</ref>

His class-based resentment of the rich appeared in a May 1865 statement to W.H. Holden, the man he appointed governor of North Carolina: "I intend to confiscate the lands of these rich men whom I have excluded from pardon by my proclamation, and divide the proceeds thereof among the families of the wool hat boys, the Confederate soldiers, whom these men forced into battle to protect their property in slaves."<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/holden/holden.html "Memoirs of W.W. Holden: Electronic Edition".]</ref> In practice, Johnson was seemingly not harsh toward the Confederate leaders. He allowed the Southern states to hold elections in 1865. Subsequently, prominent former Confederate leaders were elected to the U.S. Congress, which however refused to seat them. Congress and Johnson argued in an increasingly public way about [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the manner in which the Southern secessionist states would be readmitted to the Union. Johnson favored a very quick restoration, similar to the plan of leniency that Lincoln advocated before his death.

===Break with the Republicans: 1866===
Johnson-appointed governments all passed [[Black Codes in the USA|Black Codes]] that gave the [[freedmen]] second class status. In response to the Black Codes and worrisome signs of Southern recalcitrance, the Republicans blocked the readmission of the secessionist states to the Congress in fall 1865. Congress also renewed the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedman's Bureau]], but Johnson vetoed it. Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois, leader of the moderate Republicans, took affront at the Black Codes. Trumbull proposed the first Civil Rights bill.

Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the Civil Rights bill, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. His veto message objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when eleven out of thirty-six states were unrepresented and attempted to fix, by federal law, "a perfect equality of the white and black races in every State of the Union." Johnson said it was an invasion by federal authority of the rights of the states; it had no warrant in the Constitution and was contrary to all precedents. It was a "stride toward centralization and the concentration of all legislative power in the national government."<ref>Rhodes, ''History'' 6:68</ref> Johnson, in a letter to Gov. Thomas C. Fletcher of Missouri, wrote, "This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, it shall be a government for white men."<ref>Trefousse pg. 236. Online reference to the quote available at http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/grant/peopleevents/e_impeach.html</ref>

The Democratic Party, proclaiming itself the party of white men, North and South, aligned with Johnson.<ref>Trefousse 1999</ref> However, the Republicans in Congress overrode his veto (the Senate by the vote of 33:15, the House by 182:41) and the Civil Rights measure became law.

The last moderate proposal was the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], also written by Trumbull. It was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went further. It extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the federal war debt and voided all Confederate war debts. Johnson unsuccessfully sought to block ratification of the amendment.

The moderates' effort to compromise with Johnson had failed and an all-out political war broke out between the Republicans (both radical and moderate) on one side, and on the other Johnson and his allies in the Democratic party in the North, and the conservative groupings in the South. The decisive battle was the [[United States House election, 1866|election of 1866]], in which the Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour of the north that was known as the "[[Swing Around the Circle]]"; the tour proved politically disastrous, with Johnson widely ridiculed and occasionally engaging in hostile arguments with his audiences.<ref>[http://www.usa-presidents.info/speeches/cleveland-speech.html Andrew Johnson Cleveland Speech (September 3, 1866)]</ref> The Republicans won by a landslide and took full control of Reconstruction.

Historian [[James Ford Rhodes]] explained Johnson's inability to engage in serious negotiations:<blockquote>
As Senator [[Charles Sumner]] shrewdly said, "the President himself is his own worst counselor, as he is his own worst defender." Johnson acted according to his nature. He had intellectual force, but it worked in a groove. Obstinate, rather than firm, it undoubtedly seemed to him that following counsel and making concessions were a display of weakness. At all events from his December message to the veto of the Civil Rights bill, he did not yield to Congress. The moderate senators and representatives, who constituted a majority of the Union party, asked him for only a slight compromise. Their action was really an entreaty that he would unite with them to preserve Congress and the country from the policy of the radicals.

The two projects which Johnson had most at heart were the speedy admission of the Southern senators and representatives to Congress and the relegation of the question of 'negro suffrage' to the States themselves. Johnson, shrinking from the imposition on these communities of the franchise for the colored people, took an  unyielding position regarding matters involving no vital principle and did much to bring it about. His quarrel with Congress prevented the readmission into the Union on generous terms of the members of the late Confederacy.  For the quarrel and its unhappy results, Johnson's lack of imagination and his inordinate sensitiveness to political gadflies were largely responsible.

Johnson sacrificed two important objects to petty considerations. His pride of opinion and his desire to win, blinded him to the real welfare of the South and of the whole country.<ref>Rhodes, ''History'' 6:74</ref></blockquote>

===Impeachment===
====First attempt====
[[File:Andew Johnson impeachment trial.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore R. Davis]]' illustration of Johnson's impeachment trial in the [[United States Senate]], published in ''Harper's Weekly''.]]
There were two attempts to remove President Andrew Johnson from office. The first occurred in the fall of 1867. On November 21, 1867, the House Judiciary committee produced a bill of impeachment that consisted of a vast collection of complaints against him. After a furious debate, a formal vote was held in the House of Representatives on December 5, 1867, which failed 57<U+2013>108.<ref>Trefousse, 1989 pages 302<U+2013>3</ref>

====Second attempt====
{{Main|Impeachment of Andrew Johnson}}
[[File:AJohnsonimpeach.jpg|thumb|The 1868 Impeachment Resolution]]
Johnson notified Congress that he had removed [[Edwin Stanton]] as Secretary of War and was replacing him in the interim with Adjutant-General [[Lorenzo Thomas]]. Johnson had wanted to replace Stanton with former general [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who refused to accept the position. This violated the [[Tenure of Office Act]], a law enacted by Congress in March 1867 over Johnson's veto, specifically designed to protect Stanton.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9071723/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act{{ndash}} Britannica Online Encyclopedia]</ref> Johnson had vetoed the act, claiming it was unconstitutional. The act said, "...every person holding any civil office, to which he has been appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate ... shall be entitled to hold such office until a successor shall have been in like manner appointed and duly qualified," thus removing the president's previous unlimited power to remove any of his cabinet members at will. Years later in the case ''[[Myers v. United States]]'' in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that such laws were indeed unconstitutional.<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9380467/Tenure-of-Office-Act Tenure of office act{{ndash}} Britannica Concise]</ref>

The Senate and House entered into debate. Thomas attempted to move into the war office, for which Stanton had Thomas arrested. Three days after Stanton's removal, the House [[impeachment|impeached]] Johnson for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act.

On March 5, 1868, a court of impeachment was constituted in the Senate to hear charges against the president. [[William M. Evarts]] served as his counsel. Eleven articles were set out in the resolution, and the trial before the Senate lasted almost three months. Johnson's defense was based on a clause in the Tenure of Office Act stating that the then-current secretaries would hold their posts throughout the term of the president who appointed them. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, it was claimed, the applicability of the act had already run its course.
[[File:The situation.jpg|thumb|''The Situation''<br/>A ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' cartoon gives a humorous breakdown of "the situation". [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin Stanton]] aims a cannon labeled "Congress" on the side at [[President of the United States|President]] Johnson and [[Lorenzo Thomas]] to show how Stanton was using congress to defeat the president and his unsuccessful replacement. He also holds a rammer marked "Tenure of Office Bill" and cannon balls on the floor are marked "Justice". [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and an unidentified man stand to Stanton's left.]]

There were three votes in the Senate. One came on May 16 for the 11th article of impeachment, which included many of the charges contained in the other articles, and two on May 26 for the second and third articles, after which the trial adjourned. On all three occasions, 35 senators voted "guilty" and 19 "not guilty", thus falling short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction in impeachment trials by a single vote. A decisive role was played by seven Republican senators - [[William Pitt Fessenden]], [[Joseph S. Fowler]], [[James W. Grimes]], [[John B. Henderson]], [[Lyman Trumbull]], [[Peter G. Van Winkle]] and [[Edmund G. Ross]] of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote,<ref>[http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/john.htm "The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868".]</ref> - who were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence, in defiance of their party and public opinion, voted against conviction.<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/13490/Andrew-Johnson-Trial.html "Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson".]</ref>

===Christmas Day amnesty for Confederates===
One of Johnson's last significant acts was granting unconditional [[amnesty]] to all Confederates on Christmas Day, December 25, 1868, after the election of U.S. Grant to succeed him, but before Grant took office in March 1869. Earlier amnesties, requiring signed oaths and excluding certain classes of people, had been issued by Lincoln and by Johnson.

Andrew Johnson is one of only four presidents<ref>The other three presidents are [[William Henry Harrison]], [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Jimmy Carter]].</ref> who did not have an opportunity to appoint a judge to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In April, 1866 he nominated [[Henry Stanbery]] to fill the vacancy left with the death of [[John Catron]], but the Republican Congress eliminated the seat.

===States admitted to the Union===
*[[Nebraska]] <U+2013> March 1, 1867

===Foreign policy===
Johnson forced the [[France|French]] out of [[Mexico]] by sending an army to the border and issuing an ultimatum. The French withdrew in 1867, and the government they supported quickly collapsed. Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska purchase|purchase of Alaska]] from Russia on April 9, 1867 for $7.2 million. This is equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|7200000|1867}}}} in present day terms.{{inflation-fn|US}} Critics sneered at "[[Seward's Folly]]" and "Seward's Icebox" and "Icebergia." Seward also negotiated to purchase the [[Danish West Indies]], but the Senate refused to approve the purchase in 1867 (it eventually happened in 1917). The Senate likewise rejected Seward's arrangement with the United Kingdom to arbitrate the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]].

The U.S. experienced tense relations with the United Kingdom and its colonial government in Canada in the aftermath of the war. Lingering resentment over the perception of British sympathy toward the Confederacy resulted in Johnson initially turning a blind eye towards a series of armed incursions by Irish-American civil war veterans into British territory in Canada, named the [[Fenian Raids]].<ref name="fenian">[http://www.doyle.com.au/fenian_raids.htm The Fenian Raids]</ref> Eventually, Johnson ordered the Fenians disarmed and barred from crossing the border, but his hesitant reaction to the crisis helped motivate the movement toward [[Canadian Confederation]].<ref name="fenian"/>

Johnson's [[purchase of Alaska]] from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1867 is believed to be his most important foreign policy action. The idea and implementation is credited to Seward as Secretary of State, but Johnson approved the plan. Gold was not discovered in Alaska until 1880, thirteen years after the purchase and five years after Johnson's death, and oil was not discovered until 1968.

==Post-presidency==
[[File:Andrew Johnson House Greeneville year1886 153142pu.png|thumb|The Johnson home in [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], 1886, today restored and known as the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].]]
Johnson was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States Senate from Tennessee in 1868 and to the House of Representatives in 1872. However, in 1874 the Tennessee legislature did elect him to the U.S. Senate. Johnson served from March 4, 1875, until his death from a stroke near [[Elizabethton, Tennessee]], on July 31 that year. In his first speech since returning to the Senate, which was also his last, Johnson spoke about political turmoil in Louisiana.<ref name="senate">[http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Death_of_Andrew_Johnson.htm United States Senate: Death of Andrew Johnson]</ref>  His passion aroused a standing ovation from many of his fellow senators who had once voted to remove him from the presidency.<ref>[http://www.american-presidents.com/andrew-johnson Andrew Johnson]. American-Presidents.com. Accessed November 1, 2009.</ref> He is the only former president to serve in the Senate.<ref name="senate"/>
[[File:Andrew Johnson, 1875.jpg|thumb|left|Andrew Johnson in 1875. (age 66)]]
Johnson was buried in the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery, [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The cemetery is now part of the [[Andrew Johnson National Historic Site]].

==Historians' changing views on Andrew Johnson==

Views on President Johnson changed over time, depending on historians' perception of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The widespread denunciation of Reconstruction following the [[compromise of 1877]] resulted in Johnson being portrayed in a favorable light. By the 1930s a series of favorable biographies enhanced his prestige.<ref>Highly favorable were Winston (1928), Stryker (1929), Milton (1930), and Claude Bowers, ''The Tragic Era'' (1929).</ref>. Furthermore, a Beardian School (named after [[Charles Beard]] and typified by [[Howard K. Beale]]) argued that the Republican Party in the 1860s was a tool of corrupt business interests, and that Johnson stood for the people. They rated Johnson "near great", but have later changed their minds{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}, rating Johnson "a flat failure".<ref name=WpostWorst/> 

The [[Civil Rights movement]] of the 1960s brought a new perspective on Reconstruction, which was increasingly seen as a noble effort to build an [[interracial]] nation.<ref name=WpostWorst/><ref name=US/> Beginning with W. E. B. Du Bois'  ''Black Reconstruction,'' first published in 1935, historians noted African American efforts to establish public education and welfare institutions, gave muted praise for Republican efforts to extend suffrage and provide other social institutions, and excoriated Johnson for siding with the opposition to extending basic rights to former slaves.<ref name="WpostWorst"/> In this vein, [[Eric Foner]] denounced Johnson as a "fervent [[white supremacist]]" who foiled [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]<ref name=WpostWorst>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101509.html He's The Worst Ever], [[Eric Foner]], ''[[Washington Post]]'', December 3, 2006; accessed December 15, 2008.</ref>, whereas [[Sean Wilentz]] wrote that Johnson "actively sided with former Confederates" in his attempts to derail it.<ref name=Wilentz>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/9961300/the_worst_president_in_history/print The Worst President in History?], [[Sean Wilentz]], ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', April 21, 2006; accessed December 15, 2008.</ref> Accordingly, Johnson is nowadays among those commonly mentioned among the worst presidents in U.S. history.<ref name=US>[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070216/16president.johnson.htm The 10 Worst Presidents: No. 3 Andrew Johnson (1865-1869)], [[Jay Tolson]], ''[[U.S. News & World Report]], February 16, 2007; accessed December 15, 2008.</ref>
