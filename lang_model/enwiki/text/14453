Its size is {{Convert|750|km2}} and the highest point in the country is [[Morne Diablotins]], which has an elevation of {{Convert|1447|m}}. The Commonwealth of Dominica had a population of 71,293 at the 2011 Census. The capital is [[Roseau]] which is located on the [[leeward]] side of the island.

Dominica has been nicknamed the "Nature Isle of the Caribbean" <ref>[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dominica-Nature-Island-Caribbean-Hansib/dp/1870518179], P.C. Evans & L. Honeychurch - Dominica: Nature Island of the Caribbean. Hansib (1989)</ref> for its unspoiled natural beauty. It is the youngest island in the Lesser Antilles, still being formed by [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]]-[[volcano|volcanic]] activity, as evidenced by the world's second-largest [[hot spring]], [[Boiling Lake]]. The island features lush mountainous [[rainforests]], home of many rare plant, animal, and bird species. There are [[xeric]] areas in some of the western coastal regions, but heavy rainfall can be expected inland. The [[Imperial Amazon|Sisserou Parrot]] (also known as the Imperial Amazon), the island's national bird, is featured on the [[Flag of Dominica|national flag]]. Dominica's economy is heavily dependent on both tourism and agriculture.

[[Christopher Columbus]] named the island after the day of the week on which he spotted it, a Sunday (''dominica'' in Latin), 3 November 1493. In the hundred years after Columbus's landing, Dominica remained isolated, and even more [[Caribs]] settled there after being driven from surrounding islands as European powers entered the region. France formally ceded possession of Dominica to Great Britain in 1763. Great Britain then established a small colony on the island in 1805.

The [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|emancipation]] of African slaves occurred throughout the [[British Empire]] in 1834, and, in 1838, Dominica became the first British Caribbean colony to have a legislature controlled by an African majority. In 1896, the United Kingdom reassumed governmental control of Dominica, turning it into a [[Crown colony]]. Half a century later, from 1958 to 1962, Dominica became a province of the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]]. On 3 November 1978, Dominica became an independent nation.

== Etymology == <!--linked-->
The name Dominica comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for Sunday, which was the day on which it was spotted by [[Christopher Columbus]]. Its [[pre-Columbian]] name was "Wai<U+2018>tu kubuli", which means "Tall is her body".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/dominica.cfm |title=Discover Dominica: an introduction to our Caribbean island at www.dominica.dm |publisher=Dominica.dm |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> The indigenous people of the island, the [[Carib people|Caribs]], have the [[Carib Territory]], a territory similar to the [[Indian reserve]]s of Canada or the US. The official language is English in consequence of its history as a British [[colony]], [[British overseas territory|territory]], and [[Sovereign state|state]], though a [[Antillean Creole|French creole]] is spoken by many, especially people of older generations. The [[demonym]] or adjective is "Dominican" in English, with the syllable [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] being on the second "i" serving to distinguish it from same word used in reference to [[Dominican Republic]], in which case the stress is on the first "i".

== History ==
{{main|History of Dominica}}

===Early European contacts===
In 1635, France claimed Dominica along with all the other 'Petite Antilles' but no settlement was attempted. Between 1642 and 1650 a French missionary [[Raymond Breton]] became the first regular European visitor to the island. In 1660 the French and English agreed that both Dominica and [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] should not be settled, but instead left to the Caribs as neutral territory. Dominica was officially neutral for the next century, but the attraction of its resources remained; rival expeditions of English and French foresters were harvesting timber by the start of the 18th century.<ref name=bn>"Background note: Dominica". [[U.S. Department of State]] (July 2008). {{PD-notice}}</ref>

===French colony===
In 1715, the French established their first permanent settlements in Dominica following a revolt of "poor white" smallholders in the north of [[Martinique]], known as La Gaoul<U+00E9>,<ref>P.C. Emmer & BW Highman, (1999) General History of the Caribbean:Methodology and historiography of the Caribbean, volume 6 pp 637 [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E12cpltazYgC&lpg=PA637&ots=rEdDkFYI4I&dq=smallholders%20in%20Martinque%20la%20gaoule&pg=PA637#v=onepage&q=smallholders%20in%20Martinque%20la%20gaoule&f=false]</ref> which caused an exodus of them to southern Dominica. In 1727 the first French commander, M. Le Grand, took charge of the island with a basic French government thus making Dominica formally a colony of France and the island was divided into districts or "quarters".<ref>http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?Id=394</ref> Already installed in Martinique and [[Guadeloupe]], the French gradually implanted in Dominica by introducing the cultivation of coffee. They imported African slaves to fill the labor they needed. As part of the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[Seven Years' War]], the island became a British possession. In 1778, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], the French [[Invasion of Dominica|mounted a successful invasion]] with the active cooperation of the population. The [[1783 Treaty of Paris]], which ended the war, returned the island to Britain. French invasions in 1795 and 1805 ended in failure.<ref name=bn/>

[[File:Agostino Brunias - Linen Market, Dominica - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|A linen market in 1770s Dominica.]]

===British colony===
In 1763, the British established a [[Legislative Assembly|legislative assembly]], representing only the [[white people|white]] population. In 1831, reflecting a liberalization of official British racial attitudes, the Brown Privilege Bill<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L0cXAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA211 |title=Anti-Slavery Monthly Reporter volume 3|author=London Society for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Dominions}}</ref> conferred political and social rights on [[Free black|free non-whites]]. Slavery was abolished in Dominica in 1834. Three people of African descent were elected to the legislative assembly the following year. In 1838,  Dominica became the only [[British West Indies|British Caribbean colony]] to have an African-controlled legislature in the 19th century. Following the [[abolition of slavery]], many slaves fled from the neighboring islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, using makeshift boats, trying to find refuge in Dominica. Most African legislators were smallholders or merchants who held economic and social views diametrically opposed to the interests of the small, wealthy English planter class. Reacting to a perceived threat, the planters lobbied for more direct British rule.<ref name=bn/>

In 1865, after much agitation and tension, the colonial office replaced the elective assembly with one that had one-half of members who were elected and one-half who were appointed. Planters allied with colonial administrators outmaneuvered the elected legislators on numerous occasions. In 1871, Dominica became part of the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Island Federation]]. The power of the African population progressively eroded. [[Crown Colony]] government was re-established in 1896. All political rights for the vast majority of the population were effectively curtailed. Development aid, offered as compensation for disenfranchisement, proved to have a negligible effect.<ref name=bn/>

===History post-1900===
Following [[World War I]], an upsurge of political consciousness throughout the Caribbean led to the formation of the [[List of historical autonomist and secessionist movements#British West Indies|Representative Government Association]]. Marshalling public frustration with the lack of a voice in the governing of Dominica, this group won one-third of the popularly elected seats of the legislative assembly in 1924 and one-half in 1936. Shortly thereafter, Dominica was transferred from the [[British Leeward Islands|Leeward Island Administration]] and was governed as part of the [[British Windward Islands|Windwards]] until 1958, when it joined the short-lived [[West Indies Federation]].<ref name=bn/>

After the federation dissolved, Dominica became an associated state of the United Kingdom in 1967 and formally took responsibility for its internal affairs. On 3 November 1978, the Commonwealth of Dominica was granted independence by the United Kingdom.<ref name=bn/>

Independence did little to solve Dominica's problems, and in mid-1979, political discontent led to the formation of an interim government. It was replaced after the 1980 elections by a government led by the [[Dominica Freedom Party]] under Prime Minister [[Eugenia Charles]], the Caribbean's first female prime minister. Chronic economic problems were compounded by the severe impact of hurricanes in [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season|1979]] and in 1980.

In 1981, Dominica was threatened with a takeover by mercenaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-3376.html |title=Caribbean Islands <U+2013> Regional Security Threats, 1970<U+2013>81 |publisher=Country-data.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> In 1981, a group of "[[mercenary|mercenaries]]" led by Mike Perdue of [[Houston]] and [[Wolfgang Droege]] of [[Toronto]], attempted to overthrow the government of Eugenia Charles. The North America mercenary group was to aid ex-Prime Minister [[Patrick John]] and his Dominica Defence Force in regaining control of the island in exchange for control over the island's future development. The entire plan failed and the ship hired to transport the men of [[Operation Red Dog]] never even made it off the dock as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was tipped off. The self-titled mercenaries lacked any formal military experience and/or training and the majority of the crew had been misled into joining the armed coup by the con-man ringleader Mike Perdue. "White" nationalist [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] was also jailed for his part in the attempt, which violated US [[Neutrality Act|neutrality]] laws.<ref>The book ''[http://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Pigs-Audacious-Tropical-Criminal/dp/0470153822 Bayou of Pigs]'', written by Stewart Bell, details the story of this misguided attempt to turn Dominica into a criminal paradise.</ref>

By the end of the 1980s, the economy recovered, but weakened again in the 1990s because of a decrease in [[banana]] prices.<ref name=bn/>

In the January 2000 elections, the Edison James [[United Workers' Party (Dominica)|United Workers Party]] (UWP) was defeated by the [[Dominica Labour Party|Dominican Labour Party]] (DLP), led by [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt P. "Rosie" Douglas]]. Douglas died after only a few months in office and was replaced by Pierre Charles, who died in office in January 2004. [[Roosevelt Skerrit]], also of the DLP, replaced Charles as Prime Minister. Under Prime Minister Skerrit's leadership, the DLP won elections in May 2005 that gave the party 12 seats in the 21-member Parliament to the UWP's 8 seats. An independent candidate affiliated with the DLP won a seat as well. Later, the independent candidate joined the government and one UWP member crossed the aisle, making the total 14 seats for the DLP and 7 for the UWP.<ref name=bn/>

The DLP won a crushing victory in elections in December 2009, winning 18 of 21 seats. The UWP claimed campaign improprieties and boycotted Parliament; by-elections were conducted for two of its seats in July 2010, and the UWP once again won the seats.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm U.S. Department of State Background Note on Dominica, retrieved June 12, 2012]</ref> On 17 September 2012 [[Eliud Thaddeus Williams]] was sworn in as President, replacing Dr Nicholas Liverpool who was reportedly removed from office due to ill health.

Dominica is an [[island nation]] and [[borderless country]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], the northernmost of the [[Windward Islands]] (though it is sometimes considered the southernmost of the [[Leeward Islands]]). The size of the country is about {{convert|289.5|sqmi|km<U+00B2>}}. The capital is [[Roseau]].

Dominica is largely covered by [[rainforest]] and is home to the world's second-largest [[hot spring]], [[Boiling Lake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dominica.gov.dm/cms/index.php?q=node/520 |title=Between Two Reunions: Boiling Lake, 1988 to 2008 &#124; dominica.gov.dm: The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica's Official Website |publisher=dominica.gov.dm |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> Dominica has many waterfalls, springs, and rivers.

Baptiste (Forestry, Wildlife and Parks Division).</ref> The volcanic nature of the island has attracted [[scuba diving|scuba divers]]. The island has several [[protected area]]s, including [[List of national parks of Dominica|Cabrits National Park]], as well as 365 rivers.

On his second voyage to the Caribbean, Dominica was the first [[New World]] country that Christopher Columbus discovered. It is said that when his royal sponsors asked [[Christopher Columbus]] to describe this island, he crumpled a piece of parchment roughly and threw it on the table. "This", Columbus explained, "is what Dominica looks like<U+2014>completely covered with mountains with nary a flat spot."{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Morne Trois Pitons National Park]] is a tropical forest blended with scenic volcanic features.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/814 |title=Morne Trois Pitons National Park by World Heritage Sites |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=7 December 1997 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> It was recognised as a [[World Heritage Site]] on 4 April 1995, a distinction it shares with four other Caribbean islands.<ref>[[Pitons|St. Lucia]] (2004), [[Brimstone Hill|Saint Kitts]] (1999), Hispaniola (Dominican Republic [1990]/Haiti [1982]) and Cuba (multiple)</ref>

There are two primary population centres: Roseau (with 14,725 inhabitants in 2011) and [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]] (with 4,167 inhabitants in 2011).

Dominica, known as "The Nature Island of the Caribbean" due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system; the most mountainous of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest, thermally active lake in the world possesses the most pristine wilderness in the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Keith |title=Life in the Caribbean |year=2010 |publisher=New Africa Press |isbn=978-9987160150 |pages=288 |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-The-Caribbean-Keith-Thompson/dp/9987160158/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1349629504&sr=8-2}} p.173.</ref> Originally, it was protected by sheer mountains which led the European powers to build ports and agricultural settlements on other islands. More recently, the citizens of this island have sought to preserve its spectacular natural beauty by discouraging the type of high-impact tourism which has damaged nature in most of the Caribbean.

Visitors can find large tropical forests, including one which is on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites, hundreds of streams, coastlines and coral reefs.

The [[Imperial Parrot|Sisserou parrot]] (''Amazona imperialis'') is Dominica's national bird and is [[endemism|endemic]] to its mountain forests. A related species, the Jaco or [[Red-necked Parrot]] (''A. arausiaca''),. is also a Dominican endemic. Both birds are rare and protected nowadays, though some forest is still threatened by logging in addition to the long-standing threat of hurricanes.

The Caribbean Sea offshore of the island of Dominica is home to many [[cetacean]]s. Most notably a group of [[sperm whale]]s live in this area year round. Other cetaceans commonly seen in the area include [[spinner dolphin]]s, [[pantropical spotted dolphin]]s and [[bottlenose dolphin]]s. Less commonly seen animals include [[killer whales]], [[false killer whale]]s, [[pygmy sperm whale]]s, [[dwarf sperm whale]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[common dolphin]]s, [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]]s, [[humpback whales]] and [[Bryde's whale]]s. This makes Dominica a destination for tourists interested in [[whale-watching]].

Dominica is especially vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s as the island is located in what is referred to as the hurricane region. In 1979, Dominica was hit directly by category 5 [[Hurricane David]], causing widespread and extreme damage. On 17 August 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]], a category 1 at the time, hit the island. A mother and her seven-year-old son died when a [[landslide]] caused by the heavy rains crushed their house.<ref name="Forbes Haiti preps">{{cite news | title =  Hurricane Dean Gains Caribbean Strength | author = Jonathan Katz | agency = Associated Press | url = http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/08/18/ap4033014.html | date = 18 August 2007 | accessdate = 2007-08-18 | work=Forbes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In another incident two people were injured when a tree fell on their house.<ref name="cbc_2007-08-17">{{cite web |date=17 August 2007|title=Hurricane claims one life in St. Lucia and possibly two in Dominica|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 August 2007}}</ref> [[Prime Minister of Dominica|Prime Minister]] [[Roosevelt Skerrit]] estimated that 100 to 125 homes were damaged, and that the agricultural sector was extensively damaged, in particular the banana crop.<ref name="cbc_2007-08-17_02">{{cite web |date=17 August 2007|title=Dominica Badly Affected|publisher=CBC|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070828065016/http://www.cbc.bb/content/view/12195/45/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 August 2007}}</ref>

Dominica is a [[parliamentary democracy]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and, since 1979, a member of [[La Francophonie]]. The Commonwealth of Dominica is one of the Caribbean's few [[republic]]s. The president is the [[head of state]], while executive power rests with the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], headed by the [[prime minister]]. The [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] consists of the thirty-member [[House of Assembly of Dominica|House of Assembly]], which consists of twenty-one directly elected members and nine senators, who may either be appointed by the president or elected by the other members of the House of Assembly.

Unlike other former British colonies in the region, Dominica was never a [[Commonwealth realm]], instead becoming a republic on independence. Dominica is a full and participating member of the [[Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM)]] and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).

Dominica is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the US military, as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]. In January 2008 Dominica joined the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]].

Dominica is divided into ten [[parishes of Dominica|parishes]], given below with their 2011 Census populations:

In 2008, Dominica had one of the lowest [[per capita]] [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) rates of Eastern Caribbean states.<ref>{{cite web |title=(Dominica 07/08, U.S. State Dept.)|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2295.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=(World Bank 'At A Glance')|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOECS/Resources/Dominica.AAG.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The country nearly had a financial crisis in 2003 and 2004, but Dominica's economy grew by 3.5% in 2005 and 4.0% in 2006, following a decade of poor performance. Growth in 2006 was attributed to gains in tourism, construction, offshore and other services, and some sub-sectors of the banana industry. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) recently praised the Government of Dominica for its successful macroeconomic reforms. The IMF also pointed out remaining challenges, including the need for further reductions in public debt, increased financial sector regulation, and market diversification.<ref name=bn/>

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Dominica.jpeg|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Dominica's product exports in 28 color-coded categories.]]
Bananas and other agriculture dominate Dominica's economy, and nearly one-third of the labour force works in agriculture. This sector, however, is highly vulnerable to weather conditions and to external events affecting commodity prices. In 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]] caused significant damage to the agricultural sector as well as the country's infrastructure, especially roads. In response to reduced [[European Union]] (EU) banana [[trade preference]]s, the government has diversified the agricultural sector by promoting the production of coffee, [[patchouli]], [[aloe vera]], cut flowers, and exotic fruits such as mango, guava, and papaya. Dominica has also had some success in increasing its manufactured exports, primarily soap.<ref name=bn/>

Dominica is mostly volcanic and has few beaches; therefore, [[Tourism in Dominica|tourism]] has developed more slowly than on neighboring islands. Nevertheless, Dominica's mountains, rainforests, freshwater lakes, hot springs, waterfalls, and diving spots make it an attractive [[eco-tourism]] destination. Cruise ship stopovers have increased following the development of modern docking and waterfront facilities in Roseau, the capital.<ref name=bn/> Out of 22 Caribbean islands tracked, Dominica had the fewest visitors in 2008 (55,800 or 0.3% of the total). This was about half as many as visited Haiti.<ref>{{cite book | author = DeLollis, Barbara and Hansen, Barbara |title = Bookings started to fall along with stock market | publisher = USA Today | date = 19 January 2009}}</ref>

Dominica's currency is the [[East Caribbean Dollar]].

Dominica is a beneficiary of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] (CBI) that grants duty-free entry into the United States for many goods. Dominica also belongs to the predominantly English-speaking [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS).<ref name=bn/>

Dominica supposedly offers tax-free status to companies locating from abroad. It is not known how many companies benefit from the tax-free status because of the strict confidentiality the government enforces, although it is known many [[Internet]] businesses utilise Dominica for this reason. However, on 12 July 2012 Dominica signed an agreement with Poland to exchange tax information.<ref>http://www.mf.gov.pl/dokument.php?const=1&dzial=153&id=304841&typ=news</ref>

The Commonwealth of Dominica offers an official and legally mandated [[economic citizenship]] to those seeking a valid second passport. The nationality law of Dominica authorizes the government to waive the normal requirement of seven years of legal residence to acquire citizenship in exchange for a cash contribution. Total costs including all fees for a single applicant come to about $105,000, with an additional $25,000 specified for a spouse and up to two children under 18. The Dominican passport holders can travel without a visa, or obtain a visa upon entry, to nearly 90 countries and territories. Applying for Dominica citizenship requires interacting with official Government Approved Economic Citizenship Agents.

== Infrastructure ==
{{main|Transport in Dominica}}

===Air===
There are two small airports on the island. The primary airport, [[Melville Hall Airport]] (DOM), is on the northeast coast and is about a 45-minute drive from Portsmouth. The second is [[Canefield Airport]] (DCF), about 15 minutes from Roseau on the southwest coast. Melville Hall Airport is suitable for limited use of commercial jets because of runway length. Melville Hall currently has regular service by [[BVI Airways]], [[Winair]], and [[LIAT]] using twin turboprop aircraft like the [[De Havilland Dash 8]], as well as [[Conviasa]] and [[Amerijet]], which, using [[Boeing 727|Boeing 727 Freighters]], is the only airline with jet service to the republic. A runway extension and service upgrade project began at Melville Hall around 2006 and was finished in 2010. In March 2013, airline American Eagle halted flights to the island citing high labor costs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/business/american-eagle-worries/}}</ref>

===Roads===
The only major [[highway]] on the island is the road between [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]] and [[Roseau]]. It takes about one hour to drive from Portsmouth to Roseau. Private minibuses form the major public transport system. However, this "highway" was under major reconstruction via help from the Chinese and was completed in April 2012.<ref>[http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/economy-development/completion-ceremony-of-edward-oliver-leblanc-highway-today/ highway completed]</ref> The other roads on the island are generally in deplorable condition with little prospect for improvement.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of Dominica}}

The vast majority of Dominicans are of African descent. There is a significant mixed population, along with Indo-Caribbean or East Indian groups, a small European origin minority (descendants of French, British, and Irish colonists) and there are small numbers of Lebanese, Syrians and Asians. Dominica is also the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native [[Caribs]], who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. There are only about 3,000 Caribs remaining. They live in eight villages on the east coast of Dominica. This special [[Carib Territory]] was granted by the British Crown in 1903.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/caribs.htm |title=The Carib Indians |publisher=Avirtualdominica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> There are also about 1,000 medical students from the United States and Canada who study at the [[Ross University]] School of Medicine in Portsmouth.

The population growth rate of Dominica is very low, due primarily to emigration to other countries. In the early 21st century, emigrant numbers for the most popular countries are as follows: the United States (8,560), the United Kingdom (6,739), [[Canada]] (605) and France (394).

It has recently been noted that Dominica has a relatively large number of [[centenarian]]s. As of March 2007, there are 22 centenarians out of the island's 70,000 inhabitants<U+2014>three times the average incidence of centenarianism in developed countries.<ref name=FOOC>Pickford, John ''From Our Own Correspondent'' BBC Radio 4. First broadcast 31 March 2007. Dominica report 17'49" <U+2013> 22'55"</ref> The reasons for this are the subject of current research being undertaken at Ross University School of Medicine.

About 80% of the population is [[Roman Catholic]], though in recent years a number of [[Protestant]] churches have been established. There is also a small [[Muslim]] community in Dominica, and the nation's first [[mosque]] was built recently near Ross University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arabwashingtonian.org/english/article.php?articleID=547&issue=19 |title=Tropical Islam |publisher=Arabwashingtonian.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>

English is the official language of Dominica and is universally spoken and understood. However, because of historic French occupation during different times in history, and the island's location between the two French-speaking departments of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], [[Antillean Creole]], based on French, is spoken by many people on the island, especially from the older generation. Because of a decline in its usage by the younger generation, initiatives have been set up in an effort to increase usage and promote this unique part of the nation's history and culture. The dialect of Dominica also includes Kokoy, along with [[Creole (language)|Creole]]<U+2014>French-based patois. Cocoy, or Kokoy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0521710162/ref=sib_dp_pt#reader-link |author=Schreier, D et al |title=Lesser-known varieties of English |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010}}</ref> is a mix of Leeward Island English-Creole and Dominican Creole. It is mainly spoken in the north-eastern villages of Marigot and Wesley.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avirtualdominica.com/creole.htm |title=Creole for Beginners |publisher=Avirtualdominica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> As a result of this admixture of languages and heritage, Dominica is a member of both the English-speaking [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the French-speaking [[La Francophonie]].

At the beginning of the twentieth century the Rose's Company, which produced [[Rose's lime juice]], saw demand for its product outgrow its ability to supply the product from [[Montserrat]]. Their response to the situation was to buy land on Dominica and encourage Montserrat farm labourers to relocate. As a result there came to be two linguistic communities in Dominica. Over time there has been much intermarrying, but there are still traces of difference in origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lennoxhonychurch.com/article.cfm?id=402 |title=Migration from Montserrat to Dominica |publisher=Lennoxhonychurch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Dominica|Music of Dominica}}
[[File:Carib Territory.svg|thumb|left|Dominica's east coast territory of the [[Carib people|Kalinago people]]]]

Dominica is home to a wide range of people. Although it was historically occupied by several native tribes, the [[Arawak peoples|Arawaks]] and Kalinago [[Carib people|Carib]] tribes remained by the time European settlers reached the island. "Massacre" is a name of a river dedicated to the murders of the Native villagers by French and British settlers, because the river ran red with blood for days. Each (French and British) claimed the island and imported [[slaves]] from Africa. The remaining Caribs now live on a {{convert|3700|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} territory on the east coast of the island. They elect their own chief. This mix of cultures is important to Dominica.

Music and dance are important facets of Dominica's culture. The annual independence celebrations show an outburst of traditional song and dance preceded since 1997 by weeks of Creole expressions such as "Creole in the Park" and the "[[World Creole Music Festival]]".
Dominica gained prominence on the international music stage when in 1973, Gordon Henderson founded the group [[Exile One]] and an original musical genre which he coined "[[Cadence-lypso]]" which paved the way for modern Creole music. Other musical genres include "Jing ping" and "[[Kadans|Cadence]]". [[Jing ping]] heavily features the accordion and is native to the island. Dominica's music is an intoxicating melange of Afro-Cuban, African and European traditions. Popular artists over the years include Chubby and the Midnight Groovers, Bells Combo, the Gaylords, [[Windward Caribbean Kulture|WCK]], and Triple Kay.

[[File:Dominica Carnival - trunk.jpg|thumb|right|Dominica's annual Carnival, locally referred to as "Mas"]]
The 11th annual World [[creole music|Creole Music]] Festival was the first activity held there since its completion on 27 October 2007, part of the island's celebration of independence from Great Britain on 3 November. A year-long reunion celebration began in January 2008 marking 30 years of independence.

[[File:Dominica world creole festival.jpg|thumb|left|Dominica's World Creole Music Festival attracts thousands of visitors.]]
Dominica is often seen as a society that is migrating from collectivism to that of individualism. The economy is a developing one that previously depended on agriculture. Signs of collectivism are evident in the small towns and villages which are spread across the island.

The famed novelist [[Jean Rhys]] was born and raised in Dominica. The island is obliquely depicted in her best-known book, [[Wide Sargasso Sea]]. Rhys's friend, the political activist and writer [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]], set her 1954 novel, ''The Orchid House'' (ISBN 0-8135-2332-X), in Dominica.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Dominica cuisine}}

Dominica's cuisine is similar to many other Caribbean islands including that of Trinidad and St Lucia. Though separated by water Dominica like many other [[Commonwealth Caribbean]] islands have their distinct twist to their meals. Breakfast is an important meal in Dominica and is eaten everyday, typically eaten meals include saltfish which are dried and salted codfish and Bakes made by making a dough and frying in oil prove popular before a long days at work. Saltfish and bakes are also doubled up as a fast food snack that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors on Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passersby alongside fried chicken, fish and tasty smoothies. Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten, more British influenced meals like eggs, bacon and toast are also popular alongside fried fish and plantains.

[[File:Dominica bakes.jpg|thumb|left|Bakes is typically eaten for breakfast or as a snack]]
Common vegetables include [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]], Tania (a root vegetable), [[Yam (vegetable)|Yam]], [[Potato]], [[rice and peas]]. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, fish which are normally stewed down with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme and using the browning method to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, [[Brown Stew chicken]], stew beef, fried and stewed fish and many different types of hearty fish broths and soups which are packed full with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.

== Education ==
The island has its own [[Dominica State College|state college]], formerly named Clifton Dupigny Community College. Some Dominicans get scholarships from the [[Cuba]]n government to attend universities in Cuba. Others go to the [[University of the West Indies]] or to schools in the United Kingdom, the United States, or other countries for higher education. [[Ross University]],<ref>[http://www.rossu.edu/medical-school/ Ross University School of Medicine, Dominica]</ref> a medical school, is located at [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]]. The Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center (ATREC),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/public/rec/archbold/|title=Clemson University ATREC |year=2012 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> a biological field station owned by [[Clemson University]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu |title=Clemson University |publisher=Clemson.edu |date=8 January 2010 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> is located at Springfield Estate between Canefield and Pond Cass<U+00E9>. In 2006, another medical school called All Saints University School of Medicine <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allsaintsuniversity.org/|title=All Saints University School of Medicine,Dominica|accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> opened in temporary facilities in Loubiere, with a permanent campus being constructed in [[Grand Bay, Dominica|Grand Bay]]. Currently All Saints is located in Roseau, Dominica. Until 2009 there was also a marine biology institute in Mahaut, I.T.M.E (Institute for Tropical Marine Ecology), 15 minutes north of Roseau.

== Sports ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}
[[Cricket]] is a popular sport on the island, and Dominica competes in [[test cricket]] as part of the [[West Indies cricket team]]. On 24 October 2007, the 8,000-seat [[Windsor Park (Dominica)|Windsor cricket stadium]] was completed with a donation of [[EC$]]33&nbsp;million ([[US$]]17&nbsp;million, [[euro|<U+20AC>]]12&nbsp;million) from the [[government of the People's Republic of China]].

== Media ==
Dominica has two major newspapers, ''The Sun'' and ''The Chronicle''. There are two national television stations and a few radio stations, including Stations include: ZBC-AM 590, ZGBC-AM 740, ZGBC-FM 90.7 (Portsmouth), ZGBC-FM 102.1 (Roseau) and ZGBC-FM 106.1 (Marigot), Q95 FM,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiceqfm.com/index.html |title=Q95 FM |publisher=Wiceqfm.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> the [[Dominica Broadcasting Corporation]], and Kairi FM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kairifm.com/ |title=Kairi FM |publisher=Kairi FM |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}</ref> Before 2004, there was one telecommunication company [[Cable and Wireless (Caribbean)|Cable and Wireless]].
