'''HMS ''Abdiel''''' was a {{sclass-|Marksman|flotilla leader}} of the [[Royal Navy]], built by [[Cammell Laird]] during the [[First World War]]. She was converted to a [[minelayer]] during construction, commissioning during 1916, and served at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Following the end of the war, ''Abdiel'' served in the Baltic during the [[Russian Civil War]]. She was sold for scrap in 1936.

==Construction and design==
In November 1914, as part of the Emergency War Programme of shipbuilding, the British [[Admiralty]] ordered three {{sclass-|Marksman|flotilla leader}}s (i.e. large destroyers intended to lead flotillas of smaller destroyers in action) from the [[Birkenhead]] shipyard [[Cammell Laird]].<ref name="Fried p136-7">Freidman 2009, pp. 136<U+2013>137.</ref><ref name="Fried p307">Friedman 2009, p. 307.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The first two ships of the class, {{HMS|Marksman|1915|2}} and {{HMS|Lightfoot|1915|2}}, were ordered as part of the 1913<U+2013>1914 shipbuilding programme, with two more ships, {{HMS|Kempenfelt|1915|2}} and {{HMS|Nimrod|1915|2}} as part of the 1914<U+2013>1915 programme.<ref name="Fried p136-7"/>|group=lower-alpha}}  The third of these three ships, HMS ''Abdiel'' (originally to be named ''Ithuriel''<ref name="Conways06 p77">Gardiner and Gray 1985, p. 77.</ref>) was laid down on 6 May 1915 and was launched on 12 October 1915.<ref name="Fried p307"/>

The ''Marksman''-class ships were {{convert|324|ft|10|in|m}} [[overall length|long overall]], {{convert|324|ft|0|m}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]] and {{convert|315|ft|0|in|m}} [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]].<ref name="Friedman p296-7">Friedman 2009, pp. 296<U+2013>297.</ref> They had a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|31|ft|9|in|m}} and a [[Draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|0|in|m}}.<ref name="Conways06 p77"/> The design [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|1440|LT|t|lk=on}} normal and {{convert|1700|LT|t}} full load.<ref name="Conways06 p77"/> ''Abdiel'' was propelled by three sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s, fed by four [[Yarrow boiler|Yarrow three-drum boilers]], rated at {{convert|36000|shp}}, which gave a speed of {{convert|34|kn}}. Four funnels were fitted.<ref name="Fried p136-7"/><ref name="Conways06 p77"/> Up to 515 tons of oil fuel could be carried, giving a range of {{convert|4290|nmi}} at {{convert|15|kn}}.<ref name="Friedman p296-7"/> The ship's crew was 104 officers and men.<ref name="Conways06 p77"/>{{#tag:ref|''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War I'' gives a crew of 110,<ref>Moore 1990, p. 67.</ref> while ''Jane's Fighting Ships 1931'' gives a crew of 128.<ref>Parkes 1931, p. 60.</ref>|group=lower-alpha}}

The armament of the ''Marksman''-class was planned to be four [[QF 4 inch naval gun Mk IV, XII, XXII|QF {{convert|4|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk IV guns]] mounted on the ships centreline, with two [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder (40-mm) "pom-pom"]] anti-aircraft guns and four 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.<ref name="Conways06 p77"/> In September 1915 it was decided to convert ''Abdiel'' to allow her to operate as a fast minelayer.{{#tag:ref|Both ''Kempenfelt'' and {{HMS|Gabriel|1915|2}} were considered for the prototype minelayer conversion, but ''Abdiel'' was chosen owing to the progress of her construction.<ref name="into p16-9">Smith 2005, pp. 16<U+2013>19.</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} The conversion involved removing the ship's torpedo tubes and the aft two 4-inch guns to allow the fitting of rails to carry [[Naval mine|mines]]. ''Abdiel''{{'}}s initial mine payload was 66 mines.<ref name="Friedman p153">Friedman 2009, p. 153.</ref> [[Canvas]] screens were fitted to hide the ship's mine rails from neutral observers. Silhouettes of guns and torpedo tubes were later painted on the canvas screens to further disguise the ship's role and equipment, particularly and long ranges and poor visibility.<ref name="into p18,fig1">Smith 2005, pp. 18, facing p. 86.</ref> When fully laden with mines, the ship's speed was reduced to {{convert|30|kn}} with a range of {{convert|800|nmi}} at {{convert|25|kn}}, sufficient for the ship's intended operational area of the [[Heligoland Bight]].<ref name="into p16-7">Smith 2005, pp. 16<U+2013>17.</ref> 

In 1917, ''Abdiel'' was fitted with a modified superstructure, while in 1918, her mine rails were modified to allow 80 mines to be carried, and a third 4-inch gun fitted.<ref name="into p24-5">Smith 2005, pp. 24<U+2013>25.</ref>

==Service==
===First World War===
On commissioning on 26 March 1916,<ref name="Fried p307"/> ''Abdiel'' joined the [[Grand Fleet]], based at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkneys]].<ref name="into p19">Smith 2005, p. 19.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Supplement to the Navy List Showing Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officers' Commands &c.: Destroyer Flotillas of the Grand Fleet|journal=The Navy List|date=March 1917|page=p. 10|url=http://digital.nls.uk/british-military-lists/pageturner.cfm?id=92030218|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> ''Abdiel'', under the command of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] [[Berwick Curtis]] was employed carrying out night-time minelaying missions in the Heliogoland Bight and off [[Horns Rev|Horns Reef]].<ref name="into p19"/> ''Abdiel'' accompanied the Grand Fleet at the [[Battle of Jutland]] on 31 May/1 June 1916.<ref name="into p20-1">Smith 2005, pp. 20<U+2013>21.</ref>  During the main fleet engagement, ''Abdiel'' was on the disengaged side of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe's]] battleships,<ref name="Cl p150">Campbell 1998, p. 150.</ref> After nightfall, Jellicoe ordered ''Abdiel'' to lay a minefield in the expected path of the retreating German fleet, to the northwest of [[Sylt]]. ''Abdiel'' successfully laid her mines between 01:24 and 02:04. Later that morning, the German battleship {{SMS|Ostfriesland||2}} struck a mine laid by ''Abdiel'' on 4 May, blowing a hole {{convert|40|x|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}}, and causing damage that kept ''Ostfriesland'' in dock until 26 July.<ref name="into p20-1"/><ref name="Cl p274,314-5,336">Campbell 1998, pp. 274, 314<U+2013>315, 336.</ref>

''Abdiel'' continued her minelaying operations through 1917 and into 1918, with her earlier solo missions being superseded by more complex operations involving more ships which resulted in larger minefields being laid.<ref name="into p27,31,33-5,36-7">Smith 2005, pp. 27, 31, 33<U+2013>35, 36<U+2013>37.</ref> In February 1918, the 20th Destroyer Flotilla, a specialist minelaying flotilla based at [[Immingham]] on the [[Humber]], was formed, with Curtis in command and ''Abdiel'' as his flagship, tasked with mining the swept channels that German minesweepers made in existing minefields.<ref name="into p38-9">Smith 2005, pp. 38<U+2013>39.</ref><ref name="Fried p155">Friedman 2009, p. 155.</ref> On 27 March 1918, while laying minefield A34 {{convert|70|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Heligoland]], ''Abdiel'', together with {{HMS|Legion|1914|2}}, {{HMS|Telemachus|1917|2}}, {{HMS|Vanquisher|D54|2}}, {{HMS|Ariel|1911|2}} and {{HMS|Ferret|1911|2}} encountered three armed German trawlers, ''Polarstern'', ''Mars'' and ''Scharbentz''. All three trawlers were sunk and 72 prisoners were captured.<ref name="EB12 p954">Dewar "Minesweeping and Minelaying" ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica'' Twelfth Edition, Vol. XXXI, p. 954.</ref><ref name="into p44-9">Smith 2005, pp. 44<U+2013>49.</ref>

During July 1918, ''Abdiel'' underwent a much needed refit.<ref name="into p68-2">Smith 2005, pp. 68<U+2013>72.</ref> On 1 August 1918, ''Abdiel'' was leading the 20th Flotilla on its way to lay minefield A67 when the flotilla ran into a German minefield, with the destroyers {{HMS|Vehement|1917|2}} and ''Ariel'' striking mines. ''Ariel'' sank quickly with the loss of 49 of her crew, but ''Abdiel'' took the remains of ''Vehement'' in tow. (''Vehement''{{'}}s bow had been blown off by the explosion, which killed 48 of her crew). The attempt proved unsuccessful, however, with the tow having to be abandoned and ''Vehement'' was scuttled.<ref name="into p74-85">Smith 2005, pp. 74<U+2013>85.</ref> The Flotilla continued its minelaying operations until the end of the war,<ref name="into p89">Smith 2005, p. 89.</ref> with ''Abdiel'' laying 6293 mines during the war.<ref name="into p95">Smith 2005, p. 95.</ref>

===Post war-operations===
''Abdiel'' continued as leader of the 20th Flotilla following the end of the war,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Supplement to the Navy List Showing Organisation of the Fleet, Flag Officers' Commands &c.: Destroyer Flotillas of the Grand Fleet|journal=The Navy List|date=January 1919|page=p. 15|url=http://digital.nls.uk/british-military-lists/pageturner.cfm?id=92370954|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> and when the 20th Flotilla was sent to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to provide minelaying support to [[British campaign in the Baltic (1918<U+2013>19)|the British intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]], ''Abdiel'' with Curtiss still in command, went at its head.<ref name="Baltic p122">Bennett 2002, p. 122.</ref> The 20th Flotilla arrived in the Baltic at the end of June 1919, but on 12 July ''Abdiel'' and five destroyers were sent back to England in order to escort a flotilla of eight [[Coastal Motor Boat]]s (CMBs) from their base at [[Osea Island]], [[Essex]] to [[Bolshoy Beryozovy Island|Biorko]], Finland. While one of the CMBs sank under tow, the other seven boats successfully reached their destination. The 20th Flotilla, supported by the minelayer {{HMS|Princess Margaret||2}}, then reverted to its main role of laying minefields to contain the Bolshevik Baltic Fleet.<ref name="Baltic p131">Bennett 2002, p. 131.</ref> On 31 August, ''Abdiel'' and {{HMS|Vittoria|1917|2}} had anchored near [[Seskar|Seskar Island]] while on patrol and were spotted by the [[Bolshevik]] [[submarine]] [[Bars-class submarine (1915)|''Pantera'']], which fired two torpedoes, which sunk ''Vittoria''. ''Abdiel'' rescued all but eight of ''Vittoria''{{'}}s crew, while ''Pantera'' returned to [[Kronstadt]].<ref name="Baltic p162">Bennett 2002, p. 162.</ref> Minelaying operations were completed by the middle of September, but ''Abdiel'' and part of the 20th Flotilla remained in the Baltic.<ref name="Baltic p163">Bennett 2002, p. 163.</ref> On 8 October 1919, pro-[[Baltic German]] forces under the command of [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] attempted to seize the Latvian capital [[Riga]]. ''Abdiel'', anchored on the [[Daugava (river)|Dvina river]] in Riga came under heavy fire on 10 October, being forced to move out of range of the shelling by Bermondt's forces.<ref name="Baltic p171-4">Bennett 2002, pp. 171<U+2013>174.</ref> Bermondt's attack was repelled by the Latvians following a bombardment by British and French warships, and on 26 October, the 20th Flotilla was relieved and set out on its journey back to the United Kingdom.<ref name="Baltic p176-0">Bennett 2002, pp. 176<U+2013>180.</ref>

In August 1920, ''Abdiel'' was reduced to reserve at the [[Nore]],<ref name="nmm">{{cite web| url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_iv.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 379236| work=Warship Histories, Vol. IV| publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> and in 1926, underwent a refit, refubishing her machinery and retubing her boilers. She was also fitted to carry larger mines during this period. On completing this refit, ''Abdiel'' reached a speed of {{convert|31|kn}} during [[sea trials]].<ref name="nmm"/><ref name="into p99">Smith p. 99.</ref> In 1928, ''Abdiel'' returned to the reserve, where she remained until 1936.<ref name="nmm"/> In July that year ''Abdiel'' was sold for scrap to Rees of [[Llanelly]].<ref name="Ditt p69">Dittmar and Colledge 1972, p. 69.</ref>
