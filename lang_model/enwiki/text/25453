'''Tupac Amaru Shakur''' (June 16, 1971 &ndash; September 13, 1996), also known by his [[stage name]]s '''2Pac''' (or simply '''Pac''') and '''Makaveli''', was an American [[Rapping|rapper]]. He has sold 75 million albums to date and is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists in the world]].<ref>http://www.forbes.com/2007/10/26/top-dead-celebrity-biz-media-deadcelebs07-cz_lg_1029celeb_slide_9.html</ref> In addition to his status as a top-selling recording artist, Shakur was a promising actor<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6067116 Growing Tupac's Legacy, 10 Years After His Death : NPR Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a social activist. Most of Shakur's songs are about growing up amid violence and hardship in ghettos, racism, problems in society and conflicts with other rappers. Shakur's work is known<ref>[http://www.helium.com/items/210365-musicians-tupac-shakur Musicians: Tupac Shakur - by Monica Leftwich - Helium<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for advocating political, economic, social and racial equality. Shakur was initially a [[Road crew|roadie]] and [[backup dancer]] for the [[alternative hip hop]] group [[Digital Underground]].<ref name="TSTA">{{cite video|title=Tupac Shakur - Thug Angel (The Life of an Outlaw)|year=2002}}</ref><ref name="TSHSD">[http://www.hotshotdigital.com/tribute/TupacShakur.html Tupac Shakur - hotshotdigital.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

Shakur became the target of lawsuits and experienced other legal problems. He was later shot five times and robbed in the lobby of a [[recording studio]] in [[New York City]]. Following the event, Shakur grew suspicious that other figures in the rap industry had prior knowledge of the incident and did not warn him; the controversy helped spark the [[East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry]]. Shakur was later convicted as a sex offender,<ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tupacshakur/articles/story/5938593/tupac_shakur_19711996</ref><ref>http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/091496pacdied.html</ref> guilty of [[sexual abuse]] for forcefully touching a woman's buttocks. After serving eleven months of his sentence he was released from prison on an appeal financed by [[Suge Knight|Marion "Suge" Knight]], the CEO of [[Death Row Records]]. In exchange for Suge's assistance, Shakur agreed to release three albums under the Death Row label.

On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a [[drive-by shooting]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He died six days later of [[respiratory failure]] and [[cardiac arrest]] at the [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada|University Medical Center]].<ref name="TSDCD">[http://www.numberonestars.com/tupacshakur/tupacdeathcertificatedetails.htm Tupac Shakur's death certificate details] reported by [[Cathy Scott]].

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
<!-- Please do not change the location of birth without discussing it on the talk page first -->
Tupac Amaru Shakur was born in the [[Spanish Harlem|East Harlem]] section of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.<ref>{{harv|Hoye|2006|p=30}}</ref> He was named after [[T<U+00FA>pac Amaru II]], a Peruvian revolutionary who led an indigenous uprising against Spain and was subsequently executed. His mother, [[Afeni Shakur]], was an active member of the [[Black Panther Party]] in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s; Shakur was born just one month after her acquittal on more than 150 charges of ''"Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks"'' in the New York [[Panther 21]] court case.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.2paclegacy.com/images/assets/bio_afeni_shakur/afeni_shakur_biography.pdf|format=PDF|title=Afeni Shakur|publisher=2Pac Legacy}}</ref> Although officially unconfirmed by the Shakur family, several sources list his birth name as either "Parish Lesane Crooks" or "Lesane Parish Crooks".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tupac Coroner's Report|url=http://www.cathyscott.com/artcls/Tupac%20Coroners%20Report.html|publisher=[[Cathy Scott]]|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref> Afeni feared her enemies would attack her son, and disguised their relation using a different last name, only to change it three months or a year later, following her marriage to [[Mutulu Shakur]].

Struggle and incarceration surrounded Shakur from an early age. His godfather, [[Geronimo Pratt|Elmer "Geronimo" Pratt]], a high ranking [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]], was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, Mutulu, spent four years at large on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list beginning in 1982, when Shakur was a pre-teen. Mutulu was wanted in part for having helped his sister [[Assata Shakur]] (also known as Joanne Chesimard) to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey, where she had been incarcerated for allegedly shooting a [[State police|state trooper]] to death in 1973. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and imprisoned for the [[Brinks robbery (1981)|robbery of a Brinks armored truck]] in which two police officers and a guard were killed.<ref name="labyrinth">{{cite book|title=LAbyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal |author=Sullivan, Randall|publisher=Grove Press|date=[[2003-01-03]]|isbn=080213971X}}</ref> Shakur had a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior, and an older stepbrother, [[Mopreme Shakur|Mopreme "Komani" Shakur]], who appeared on many of his recordings.

At the age of twelve, Shakur enrolled in [[Harlem]]'s [[127th Street Ensemble]] and was cast as the Travis Younger character in the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', which was performed at the famous [[Apollo Theater]].<!--expand if possible--> In 1986, the family relocated to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]],<ref name="vibe">{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |month=October |title=Back 2 the Essence: Friends and Families Reminisce over Hip-hop's Fallen Sons |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=100<U+2013>116 |page=103 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MSgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA103&dq=Tupac+moved+Baltimore+Marin-City&ei=i9OfSrySCo_-ygTJ1q3rDg#v=onepage&q=Tupac%20moved%20Baltimore%20Marin-City&f=false |accessdate=2009-09-03}}</ref> After completing his second year at [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]] he transferred to the [[Baltimore School for the Arts]], where he studied [[acting]], [[poetry]], [[jazz]], and [[ballet]]. He performed in [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare plays]], and in the role of the Mouse King in ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.<ref name="labyrinth"/> Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana "Mouse" Smith, as his [[beatbox]], won most of the many rap competitions that he participated in and was considered to be the best rapper in his school.<ref>{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=5}}</ref> Although he lacked trendy clothing, he was one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix in with all crowds.<ref>{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=3}}</ref> He developed a close friendship with a young [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until Shakur's death. In the documentary ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'', Shakur says, "Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life," and Pinkett Smith calls Shakur "one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime." A poem written by Shakur titled "Jada" appears in his book, ''The Rose That Grew From Concrete'', which also includes a poem dedicated to Pinkett Smith called "The Tears in Cupid's Eyes".

In June 1988, Shakur and his family moved once again, this time to [[Marin City, California|Marin City]], California,<ref name="vibe"/> where he attended [[Tamalpais High School]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/shots-silence-angry-voice-sharpened-by-the-streets.html|title=Shots Silence Angry Voice Sharpened by the Streets|last=Marriott|first=Michel|coauthors=James Brooke, Charlie LeDuff and Donatella Lorch|date=September 16, 1996|work=The New York Times|pages=A-1|accessdate=August 21, 2009}}</ref> Shakur began attending  the poetry classes of [[Leila Steinberg]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|title=Leila Steinberg|date=Assemblies in Motion|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref> In 1989, Steinberg organized a concert with Shakur's former group, Strictly Dope. The concert led to him being signed with Atron Gregory who set him up with the up-and-coming rap group [[Digital Underground]]. In 1990, he was hired as the band's backup dancer and roadie.<ref name="TSTA"/><ref name="TSHSD"/>

=== Rapping career ===
Shakur's professional entertainment career began in the early 1990s, when he debuted his rapping skills in a vocal turn in Digital Underground's "Same Song" from the [[Nothing but Trouble (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the 1991 film ''Nothing but Trouble'']] and also appeared with the group in [[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|the film]].  The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[This is an EP Release]]'', the follow-up to their debut hit album ''[[Sex Packets]]''.   Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video.  After his rap debut, Shakur performed with Digital Underground again on the album ''[[Sons of the P]]''. Later, he released his first solo album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''. Initially he had trouble marketing his solo debut, but [[Interscope Records]]' executives [[Ted Field]] and Tom Whalley eventually agreed to distribute the record.

''[[2Pacalypse Now]]'' did not do as well on the charts as future albums, spawning no top ten hits. His second record, ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]]'', was released in 1993. The album, mostly produced by [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy "Stretch" Walker]] (Shakur's closest friend and associate at the time) and the [[Live Squad]], generated two hits, "[[Keep Ya Head Up]]" and "[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]", the latter featuring guest appearances by [[Shock G]] and [[Money-B]] of the Digital Underground.

=== Thug Life ===
In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a number of his friends, including [[Big Syke]], [[Macadoshis (rapper)|Macadoshis]], his stepbrother [[Mopreme Shakur]], and Rated R. The group released their first and only record album ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'' on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single "[[Pour Out a Little Liquor]]" produced by [[Johnny "J"|Johnny "J" Jackson]], who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur.<ref>{{cite video|title=Thug Life: Vol. 1|year=1994|medium=[[CD]]}}</ref>

The concept of "Thug Life", at the time, was viewed as a philosophy of life by Shakur.

=== Legal issues ===
Even as he garnered attention as a rapper and actor, Shakur gained notoriety for his conflicts with the law. In October 1991, he filed a $10 million civil suit against the law enforcement of the Oakland Police Department, alleging they brutally beat him for [[jaywalking]].<ref name="nytimes.com">http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2</ref>

In 1992, a Texas state trooper was killed by a teenager who was listening to ''2Pacalypse Now'' which included songs about killing police. This caused a swirl of media controversy. [[Dan Quayle]], the Vice President at the time, demanded that the album be withdrawn from music stores and media across the country; Interscope refused.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> Shakur claimed his first album was aimed at the problems facing young black males, but it was criticized for its graphic language and images of violence by and against law enforcement. Quayle publicly denounced the album as having "no place in our society".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.tupac-online.com/News/0-257861-00.html|title=Tupacs Music Was A Reminder To America|publisher=Tupac Online}}</ref> 

In October 1993, in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's recent passing of the state bar examination. As they crossed the street, a car passed by them or "almost struck them", after which the Whitwells began an altercation with the driver and passengers, which was then joined by a second passing car. One officer was shot in the buttocks, and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. There were no other injuries, but Mark was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation, and Shakur with the shooting, until prosecutors decided to drop all charges against all parties.<ref>Smothers, R.

In December 1993, Shakur and others were charged with sexually abusing a woman in a hotel room. According to the complaint, Shakur [[Sodomy|sodomized]] the woman and then encouraged his friends to sexually abuse her. Shakur vehemently denied the charges. He had prior relations days earlier with the woman who was pressing the charges against him. She performed [[oral sex]] on him on a club dance floor and the two later had [[Informed consent#Sex|consensual sex]] in his hotel room. The allegations were made after she revisited his hotel room for the second time where she engaged in sexual activity with his friends and alleged that Shakur and his entourage had [[Types of rape#Gang rape|mass raped]] her, saying to him while leaving, "Why you let them do this to me?"<ref>[http://www.thuglifearmy.com/news/?id=19 ThugLifeArmy.com - A Total News Source for Hip-Hop Culture<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://jj_productions.tripod.com/rape1.htm Sex was the Case<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n21118324]{{Dead link|date=March 2009}}</ref> Shakur stated he had fallen asleep shortly after she arrived and later awoke to her accusations and legal threats. He later said he felt guilty for leaving her alone and did not want anyone else to go to jail, but at the same time he did not want to go to jail for a crime he didn't commit. Shakur was convicted of sexual abuse. In sentencing Shakur to one-and-a-half years in a correctional facility, the judge described the crime as "an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman".<ref>James, George, "Rapper Faces Prison Term For Sex Abuse", New York Times, B1 (February 8, 1995); ''also'' Olen, Helaine, "Rapper Shakur Gets Prison for Assault", Los Angeles Times, A4 (February 8, 1995); Romano, Lois, "The Reliable Source", Washington Post, B3 (February 8, 1995)</ref>

In 1994, he was convicted of attacking a former employer while on a music video set. He was sentenced to 15 days in jail with additional days on a highway work crew, [[community service]], and a $2,000 fine. Later that year he began dating [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who wanted to have his child; the two would continue to date until friends of Shakur encouraged him to end the relationship.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/bwiddicombe/2007/10/30/2007-10-30_madonna__tupac_shakurs_love_child_almost.html Madonna & Tupac Shakur's love child? Almost happened<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1995, a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] was brought against Shakur for a 1992 shooting that killed Qa'id Walker-Teal, a six-year old of Marin City. The child had been the victim of a stray bullet in a shootout between Shakur's entourage and a rival group, though the [[ballistics]] tests proved the bullet was not from Shakur or any members of his entourage's guns. Criminal charges were not sought, and Shakur settled with the family for an amount estimated between $300,000 and $500,000.<ref>"Marin slaying case against rapper opens", San Francisco Chronicle, November 3, 1995</ref><ref>"Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death". San Francisco Chronicle. November 8, 1995.</ref> After serving part of his sentence upon a conviction, he was released on bail pending his appeal.

=== November 1994 shooting ===
On the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was shot five times and robbed after entering the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan by two armed men in army fatigues. He would later accuse [[Sean Combs]],<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88461862 What Did Sean 'Puffy' Combs Know? : NPR Music<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Andre Harrell]], and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]]<U+2014>whom he saw after the shooting<U+2014>of setting him up. Shakur also suspected his close friend and associate, [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy "Stretch" Walker]], of being involved in the attempt. According to the doctors at Bellevue Hospital, where he was admitted immediately following the incident, Shakur had received five bullet wounds; twice in the head, twice in the groin and once through the arm and thigh. He checked out of the hospital, against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, Shakur entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation, but innocent of six others, including sodomy. On February 6, 1995, he was sentenced to one-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years in prison on a [[sexual assault]] charge.<ref>[http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article.aspx?storyid=118215&catid=176 Today In Entertainment History February 6 | digtriad.com | Triad, NC | Watercooler News Article<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On November 30, 1995, exactly one year to the day of the shooting, Stretch was killed in an [[execution-style murder]] in [[Queens]].

On March 27, 2008, the ''[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]'' issued an apology to Combs for blaming him for having a role in the '94 attack on Shakur. The article stated that Shakur was led to the studio by Biggie's associates to gun him down to make favor with Biggie. The newspaper relied on forged documents that [[The Smoking Gun]] proved to be faked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0325081sabatino1.html|title=Big Phat Liar|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref> Combs stated that he is disgusted with the ''LA Times'' for printing the story.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/18/people.combs.shakur.ap/index.html Diddy: 'The story is a lie' - CNN.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/26/people.combs.shakur.ap/index.html?iref=newssearch L.A.

=== Prison sentence ===
[[Image:Tupac-mugshot.jpg|thumb|Shakur in a police mug shot (March 8, 1995)]]
Shakur began serving his prison sentence at [[Clinton Correctional Facility]] on February 14, 1995. Shortly afterwards, he released his multi-platinum album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. Shakur is the only artist ever to have an album at number one on the [[Billboard 200]] while serving a prison sentence. The album made its debut on the Billboard 200 and stayed at the top of the charts for five weeks. The record album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a record for highest first week sales for a solo male rap artist at the time.<ref>"Timeline: 25 Years of Rap Records". BBC News. October 11, 2004.

In October 1995, Shakur's case was on appeal but due to all of his legal fees he could not raise the $1.4 million bail. After serving eleven months of his one-and-a-half year to four-and-a-half year sentence,<ref>Info from StreetGangs.com, from http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/091496passes.html</ref> Shakur was released from the penitentiary due in large part to the help and influence of [[Suge Knight]], the CEO of Death Row Records. Knight posted $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for which Shakur was obligated to release three albums for the Death Row label.<ref>"Biography: Suge Knight". AOL Music. nd. Retrieved on April 10, 2006, from http://music.aol.com/artist/main.adp?tab=bio&artistid=279843&albumid=0</ref>

=== Death Row Records ===
Upon his release from Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur immediately went back to song recording. He began a new group called [[Outlawz|Outlaw Immortalz]]. Shakur began recording his first album with Death Row and released the single "[[California Love]]" soon after.

[[Image:Pacsnoopsuge.jpg|thumb|Shakur, [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop "Doggy" Dogg]], and [[Suge Knight]] during Shakur's tenure on [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] (1995)]]

On February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold over nine million copies.<ref>[http://www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best_sold_albums.html The Top Selling Record Albums of All Time]</ref> The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of ''Me Against the World'', being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[R U Still Down? (Remember Me)]]'', ''[[Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'', and ''[[Pac's Life]]''. He also began the process of recording an album with the [[Boot Camp Clik]] and their label Duck Down Records, both New York-based, entitled ''One Nation''.

On June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", a scathing lyrical assault on Biggie and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with [[Faith Evans]], Biggie's wife at the time, and attacks [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Though no hard evidence suggests so, Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the shooting beforehand due to their behavior that night and what his sources told him. Shakur aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs and his successful Bad Boy label; this added fuel to building an East Coast-West Coast conflict. Both sides remained bitter enemies until Shakur's death.

On July 4, 1996, he performed live at the [[House of Blues]] with Outlawz, [[Tha Dogg Pound]], and [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop "Doggy" Dogg]] also headlining. This was Shakur's very last live performance.<ref>[http://rapaholic.blogspot.com/2006/09/2pac-live-at-house-of-blues-july-1996.html In the Name of Allah: 2pac - Live At The House Of Blues (July 1996)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

While incarcerated in [[Clinton Correctional Facility]], Shakur read and studied [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]] and other published works, which inspired his pseudonym "Makaveli" under which he released the record album ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career. Shakur wrote and recorded all the lyrics in only three days and the production took another four days, combining for a total of seven days to complete the album (hence the name). The album was completely finished before Shakur died and Shakur had complete creative input on the album from the name of the album to the cover, which Shakur chose to symbolize how the media had crucified him. Shakur had plans of starting Makaveli Records which would have included Outlawz, [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Big Syke]], and [[Gang Starr]].

=== September 1996 shooting and death ===
[[Image:Tupac4.jpg|thumb|The famous photograph of Shakur taken just twenty minutes before the [[drive-by shooting]], from the cover of the book ''The Killing of Tupac Shakur'' by [[Cathy Scott]]]]
On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the [[Mike Tyson]] - [[Bruce Seldon]] boxing match at the [[MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas. After leaving the match, one of Suge's associates spotted 21 year-old [[Orlando Anderson|Orlando "Baby Lane" Anderson]], a member of the [[Crips|Southside Crips]], in the MGM Grand lobby and informed Shakur. Shakur then attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Suge and his followers assisted in assaulting Anderson. The fight was captured on the hotel's [[Closed-circuit television|video surveillance]]. A few weeks earlier, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a [[Foot Locker]] store, precipitating Shakur's attack. After the brawl, Shakur went to [[rendezvous]] with Suge to go to Death Row-owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). He rode in Suge's 1996 black [[BMW E38|BMW 750iL]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] as part of a larger [[convoy]] including many in Shakur's entourage.

At 10:55 p.m., while paused at a red light, Shakur rolled down his window and a photographer took his photograph.<ref name="Thugs Network">[http://www.thugz-network.com/Tupac~Shakur~LV~Shooting.php Tupac Shakur LV Shooting - Thugz-Network.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At around 11:00-11:05 p.m., they were halted on Las Vegas Blvd. by Metro bicycle cops for playing the car stereo too loud and not having license plates. The plates were then found in the trunk of Suge's car; they were released without being fined a few minutes later.<ref name="Thugs Network"/><ref>[http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/s/tupacshakur/tupacshakur.htm The Murder of Tupac Shakur<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At about 11:10 p.m., while stopped at a red light at Flamingo Road near the intersection of Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their right side. Shakur, who was standing up through the [[sunroof]], exchanged words with the two women, and invited them to go to Club 662.<ref name="Thugs Network"/> At approximately 11:15 p.m., a white, four-door, late-model [[Cadillac]] with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down one of the windows, and rapidly fired twelve to thirteen shots at Shakur. He was struck by four rounds, with bullets hitting him in the chest, the [[pelvis]], and his right hand and thigh.<ref name="TSDCD"/><ref name="Thugs Network"/> One of the rounds apparently ricocheted into Shakur's right [[lung]].<ref name="AEOM">[http://www.alleyezonme.com/info/96shooting.html Detailed information on the fatal shooting] at http://www.alleyesonme.com/</ref> Suge was hit in the head by [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]], though it is thought that a bullet grazed him.<ref>[http://www.donkilluminati.com/archivedarticles.htm Don Killuminati |<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> According to Suge, a bullet from the gunfire had been lodged in his skull, but medical reports later contradicted this statement.<ref>[http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/sugeknightInfo.html 2PACWORLD.CO.UK - MARION 'SUGE' KNIGHT BIOGRAPHY, CEO OF DEATHROW RECORDS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

At the time of the drive-by Shakur's bodyguard was following behind in a vehicle belonging to [[Kidada Jones]], Shakur's then-fianc<U+00E9>e. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Suge's car, Shakur asked him to drive Kidada Jones' car instead just in case they were too drunk and needed additional vehicles from Club 662 back to the hotel. Shortly after the assault, the bodyguard reported in his documentary, ''Before I Wake'', that one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but he never heard back from the occupants.

After arriving on the scene, police and paramedics took Suge and a fatally wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center. According to an interview with one of Shakur's closest friends the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, he received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record label and were sending death threats aimed at Shakur, claiming that they were going there to "finish him off".<ref name="Gobi">[http://www.hitemup.com/interviews/gobi-feb04.html Interview with Gobi] at http://www.hitemup.com/</ref> Upon hearing this, Gobi immediately alerted the Las Vegas police, but the police claimed they were understaffed and no one could be sent.<ref name="Gobi"/> Nonetheless, the shooters never arrived.<ref name="Gobi"/> At the hospital, Shakur was in and out of [[consciousness]], was heavily [[Sedative|sedated]], was breathing through a [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]] and [[respirator]], was placed on [[life support]] machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-[[induced coma]] after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.<ref name="TSDCD"/><ref name="Gobi"/><ref name="T96SLV">[http://www.hitemup.com/tupac/96shooting2.html Tupac shooting in Las Vegas] at http://www.hitemup.com/</ref>

Despite having been resuscitated in a [[trauma center]] and surviving a multitude of surgeries (as well as the removal of a failed right lung), Shakur had gotten through the critical phase of the medical therapy and was given a 50% chance of pulling through.<ref name="AEOM"/> Gobi left the medical center after being informed that Shakur made a 13% recovery on the sixth night.<ref name="Gobi"/> While in [[Intensive Care Unit|Critical Care Unit]] on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died of [[internal bleeding]]; doctors attempted to revive him but could not impede his hemorrhaging.<ref name="TSDCD"/><ref name="T96SLV"/> His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop.<ref name="AEOM"/><ref name="T96SLV"/> He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]])<ref name="TSDCD"/> The official cause of death was noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.<ref name="TSDCD"/> Shakur's body was cremated.<ref>[http://personal.fimnet.fi/cool/rekku/bio.html Tupac Amaru Shakur<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Some of his ashes were later mixed with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and smoked by members of Outlawz.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/his-life-after-death/2006/09/12/1157826940955.html Tupac's life after death]</ref> 

==== Murder case ====
{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2009}}
Due largely to the perceived lack of progress on the case by law enforcement, many independent investigations and theories of the murder have emerged. Because of the acrimony between him and Biggie, there was speculation from the outset about the possibility of Biggie's collaboration in the murder. He, as well as his family, relatives, and associates, have vehemently denied the accusation.<ref>BBC News. September 9, 2002. Retrieved on April 10, 2006, from [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2246862.stm Rapper's family denies murder theory]</ref> In 2002, the ''LA Times'' writer [[Chuck Phillips]] claimed to have uncovered evidence implicating Biggie, in addition to Anderson and the Southside Crips, in the attack.<ref>[[BBC News]]. September 6, 2002. Retrieved on April 10, 2006, from [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/2240857.stm Paper investigates rapper murder]</ref> In the article, Phillips quoted unnamed gang-member sources who claimed Biggie had ties to the Crips, often hiring them for security during [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] appearances. However, in 2008, the ''LA Times'' printed an official front-page retraction of Phillips' story.<ref name=bs>[http://www.latimes.com/la-naw-quad17mar17,0,7227999.story Los Angeles Times Writer Chuck Philips, Author of Retracted Tupac/Diddy Story, Let Go During Layoffs].</ref> The documents Phillips used was discovered by The Smoking Gun to be completely fraudulent.<ref name=bs/> Phillips was consequently laid off less than five months later.<ref name=bs/> Biggie was murdered in March 1997.<ref>"Fresh probe over rapper's murder". BBC News. March 18, 2006. Retrieved on April 10, 2006, from http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4820224.stm</ref> 

In support of their claims, Biggie's family submitted documentation to [[MTV]] insinuating that he was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper [[Lil' Cease|James "Lil' Cease" Lloyd]] made public announcements denying Biggie's partaking in the crime and claimed further that they were both with him in the recording studio during the night of the event.

The high profile nature of the killing and ensuing gang violence caught the attention of English filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]], who made the documentary film ''[[Biggie & Tupac]]'' which examines the lack of progress in the case by speaking to those close to the two slain rappers and the investigation. Shakur's close childhood friend and member of Outlawz, Yafeu "Yaki Kadafi" Fula, was in the [[convoy]] when the drive-by occurred and indicated to police that he might be able to identify the assailants, however, he was shot and killed shortly thereafter in a housing project in [[Irvington, New Jersey|Irvington]].<ref>Jones, S. "The Truth is Being Covered Up". Philadelphia Weekly. September 18, 2002.</ref>

A DVD titled ''[[Tupac: Assassination]]'' was released on October 23, 2007, more than eleven years after Shakur's murder. It explores aspects circulating the event and provides new insight about the [[cold case]] with details of the environment.

== Influences ==
Shakur's music and philosophy is rooted in many American, African-American, and World entities, including the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Black nationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], and [[liberty]]. His debut album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]],'' revealed the socially conscious side of Shakur. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty and police brutality on songs "Brenda's Got a Baby", "Trapped" and "Part Time Mutha". His style on this album was highly influenced by the social consciousness and [[Afrocentrism]] pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[X-Clan]], and [[Grandmaster Flash]], as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.

On his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like "The Streetz R Deathrow" and "Last Wordz." He also showed his compassionate side with the inspirational anthem "Keep Ya Head Up", while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]]'' he added a salute to his former group [[Digital Underground]] by including them on the playful track "[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]". Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur's subsequent albums.

The contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. In 1996, Shakur released ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Many of these tracks are considered by many critics to be classics, including "[[Ambitionz Az a Ridah]]", "[[I Ain't Mad at Cha]]", "[[California Love]]", "[[Life Goes On (song)|Life Goes On]]" and "Picture Me Rollin'".; ''All Eyez on Me'' was a change of style from his earlier works. While still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more "feel good" vibe than his first albums. Shakur described it as a celebration of life, and the record was critically and commercially successful.

Shakur was a voracious reader. He was inspired by a wide variety of writers, including [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]], [[Donald Goines]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[Khalil Gibran]]. In his book, Dyson describes the experience of visiting the home of Shakur's friend and promoter Leila Steinberg to find "the sea of books" once owned by Shakur.<ref name="m dyson holler"/>

== Legacy ==
At a [[Mobb Deep]] concert following the death of the famed icon and release of ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]'', [[Cormega]] recalled in an interview that the fans were all shouting "Makaveli",<ref>[http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1532 Tupac Shakur: A Roundtable Discussion]{{Dead link|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1532|date=March 2009|date=September 2009}}</ref> and emphasized the influence of the ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory'' and of Shakur himself even in New York at the height of the media-dubbed 'intercoastal rivalry'. 

[[About.com]] named Shakur the most influential rapper ever.<ref>[http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_9.htm 50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987 - 2007)]</ref>

To preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later re-named the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to "provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents."  The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a [[performing arts]] day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the [[Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts]] (TASCA) in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'' was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] in the [[77th Academy Awards|2005 Academy Awards]]. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, [[Harvard University]] co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled "All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero."  The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.<ref>Gewertz, K. "Symposium analyzes, celebrates 'Thug'". Harvard University Gazette. April 24, 2003. Retrieved from [http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/04.24/11-hiphop.html news.harvard.edu/] on April 16, 2006.</ref>

Many of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including [[State University of New York]] English professor Mark Anthony Neal who gave the talk "Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the "organic intellectual" expressing the concerns of a larger group.<ref>Neal, M. "Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.</ref> Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a "leadership void amongst hip-hop artists."<ref>Neal, M. "New Black Man". Retrieved on April 16, 2006, from [http://newblackman.blogspot.com/2005/09/race-ing-katrina.html newblackman.com]</ref> Neal further describes him as a "walking contradiction", a status that allowed him to "make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people".

Professor of Communications Murray Forman, of [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], spoke of the [[mythical]] status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the [[symbolism]] and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled "Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)". Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have "succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force".<ref>Forman, M. "Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.</ref> In "From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster-figures of [[African-American folklore]] which gave rise to the urban "bad-man" persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a "prolific artist" who was "driven by a terrible sense of urgency" in a quest to "unify mind, body, and spirit".<ref>Price, E. "From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.</ref> 

[[Michael Dyson]], University of Pennsylvania Avalon Professor of Humanities and African American Studies and author of the book ''Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur''<ref name="m dyson holler">Dyson, M. ''Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur''. BasicCivitas Books. 2001.</ref> indicated that Shakur "spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity."<ref name=autogenerated1>Dyson, M. "Holler If You Hear Me". [[Harvard University]]. 2003.</ref> At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, [[race relations]], politics and the "hero/martyr".<ref>[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/04.24/11-hiphop.html  Harvard Gazette] May 1, 2003, edition, writer Ken Gewertz</ref> In late 1997, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered a student-led course entitled "History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur."<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1171/09101997/2pac.jhtml Berkeley University Offers Class On Tupac] at [[VH1]] (September 10, 1997). Retrieved on July 26, 2006.</ref>

In late 2003, the [[Makaveli Branded Clothing]] line was launched by Afeni. In 2005, Death Row released ''[[Tupac: Live at the House of Blues]]''. The DVD was the final recorded performance of Shakur's career, which took place on July 4, 1996, and features a plethora of Death Row artists. In August 2006, ''[[Tupac Shakur Legacy]]'' was released. The interactive biography was written by [[Jamal Joseph]]. It features unseen family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 removable reproductions of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other personal papers. Shakur's sixth posthumous studio album, ''[[Pac's Life]]'', was released on November 21, 2006. It commemorates the 10th anniversary of Shakur's death. He is still considered one of the most popular artists in the music industry {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.<ref>[http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20070206005852&newsLang=en Top Musical Artists for 2006]</ref>

According to ''[[Forbes]]'', in 2008 Shakur's estate made $15 million.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/2008/08/15/music-media-hiphop-biz-media-cz_zog_0818cashkings.html</ref> In 2002, they recognize him as a Top Earning Dead celebrity coming in on number ten on their list.<ref>http://www.forbes.com/2002/08/12/0812deadintro.html</ref>
