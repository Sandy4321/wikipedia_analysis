'''Thomas Gisborne''' (31 October 1758 &ndash; 24 March 1846) was an [[Anglican]] divine, priest and poet. He was a member of the [[Clapham Sect]], who fought for the [[abolitionism|abolition]] of the [[slave trade]] in England. 

==Life==
Gisborne was born at Bridge Gate, Derbyshire, the son of [[John Gisborne]] of Yoxhall Lodge in [[Needwood Forest]], [[Staffordshire]] and his wife Anne Bateman. He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and entered [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1776, where he established life-long friendships with [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Babington]]. At Cambridge, he became the first Chancellor's medallist in 1780.<ref>{{Venn|id=GSBN776T|name=Gisborne, Thomas}}</ref> He became curate of [[Barton-under-Needwood]] in 1783, and prebendary of [[Durham Cathedral|Durham]], 1823 and 1826. In 1784 he married Thomas Babington's sister Mary Babington and they lived at Yoxall Lodge, which Gisborne had inherited along with a considerable amount of money. The house provided an ideal retreat from which Wilberforce and Thomas Babington could work on the abolition of the slave trade. Wilberforce treated it as his summer residence from about 1794.<ref>[http://www.bluebellwoodsofyoxalllodge.com/history.html Bluebell Woods of Yoxall Lodge - History]</ref> Gisborne was also a close friend of [[Hannah More]]. 

Gisborne himself produced a range of religious and social works. He also wrote poetry and a number of [[hymn]]s<ref>[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/g/i/gisborne_t.htm Cyber Hymnal]</ref> and he was a member of the [[Derby Philosophical Society]].

Reverend Thomas and Mary Gisborne were portrayed by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] in 1786.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/874459 The Burlington Magazine No. 743 Vol 107 February 1965]</ref> They had eight children. His son [[Thomas Gisborne the Younger|Thomas]] was a Member of Parliament, and his daughter Mary married [[William Evans (politician)|William Evans]] who succeeded him in parliament. The youngest daughter Lydia married the Reverend Edmund Robinson but created a scandal by conducting an affair with [[Branwell Bront<U+00EB>]].

He wrote about the role of women, particularly in ''An Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex'', (1797), where he argued that women's subordinate nature is innate. Whilst he shared the view that women should not conceal their intellectual abilities, and that parents should never force their daughters into marriage, he commended the traditional feminine virtues and the domestic role for women. Law, politics and government, scholarship, philosophy, navigation and war all "demand the efforts of a mind endued with the powers of close and comprehensive reasoning, and of intense and continued application" and are thus best left to men. The concomitant duties of men are set out in his companion volume, ''An Enquiry Into the Duties of Men in the Higher and Middle Classes of Society in Great Britain'' (1794). <U+2018>The master of the house<U+2019> should <U+2018>not attend the savage spectacle of cockpits and boxing matches; nor engage in the ruinous occupations and infamous society of race-courses and gaming tables<U+2019>. Instead, he has a responsibility for the moral health and education of wife and children and should <U+2018>join the family circle in the winter<U+2019>s evening<U+2019>s perusal of selected portions of history, poetry or other improving and elegant branch of literature<U+2019>. 
===Scriptural geologist===
As a [[Scriptural geologists|scriptural geologist]], Gisborne wrote two books which criticized the trend of geology away from a basis in the Bible-''Testimony of Natural Theology to Christianity'' (1818) and ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'' (1837).  Though a clergyman and not a geologist, Gisborne was not totally ignorant in natural history and geology due to his extensive reading and own observations in his rural parish.<ref>Gisborne had carefully read:
* [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier's]] ''Theory of the Earth'' (1813)
* Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'' (1835 edition)
* [[William Buckland|Buckland's]] ''Bridgewater Treatise'' (1836)
* [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt's]] ''Voyage aux Regions Equinoxiales'' (1814)
* Lamarck's ''Systeme des Animaux sans Vertebres'' (1801)
* La Place's ''Exposition of the System of the Universe''
* [[William Daniel Conybeare|Conybeare]] and Phillips's ''Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales'' (1822) 
* [[Richard Kirwan|Kirwan"s]] ''Geological Essays'' (1799)
* Pennant's ''British Zoology'' (1818)
* Brydone's ''A Tour Through Sicily and Malta''
* Joseph Townsend's ''Character of Moses Established'' (1813-15)
* James Parkinson's ''Organic Remains'' (1804-11)
* [[Horace-B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>dict de Saussure|Horace-B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>dict de Saussure's]] ''Voyages dans les Alpes'' (1779-96)

====Attitude toward Geology====
He was not opposed to geological study or facts.  What he sought to do was to evaluate the logic of the inferences drawn from the geological facts.<ref>Geologic facts: observed characteristics of rock and fossil, i.e. type of rock, mineral content, types of fossils, etc..</ref>  Though he acknowledged geological facts he argued against certain theoretical interpretations.<ref>Theoretical Interpretations:  proposed explanations for how and why the rocks and fossil were formed.</ref>

In his criticisms of these old-earth geologic arguments he did not resort to ''ad hominem'' attacks against the leading geologists. He frequently expressed his respect for their scientific and intellectual attainments.  In particular, he described [[William Buckland]]<ref>Buckland said that Gisborne's ''Natural Theology'' contained many geological errors referring readers to a review of Gisborne by clergyman Thomas Whitaker.  Though a geologist, Buckland, relied on non-geologist Whitaker, to assert that Gisborne did not have his geological facts straight.  Whitaker vociferously opposed Gisborne's interpretations of geological facts, but failed to give any specific examples of error regarding the facts.   (Buckland, ''Vindiciae Geologicae'' (1820), 35, referred readers to a critical review in the ''Quarterly Review'', Vol. XXI (1819), 41-63, which was written by Whitaker (See Page, "Diluvialism and its critics," ''Towards a History of Geology'' (1969), edited by Cecil J. Schneer, 265, footnote 33.))</ref> as a "deservedly celebrated" and "eminent" writer. He expressed appreciation for Buckland's "luminous development" of the proofs of natural theology in his [[Natural theology|Bridgewater Treatise]] saying that Buckland "has not only given to the world a lasting memorial of his industry, knowledge, and discernment, but has rendered permanent aid to the interests of religion, whatever may be the ultimate opinion of men respecting the geological theory which he advocates.<U+201D> Of [[Georges Cuvier]] he said that his "unequalled skill and acuteness as a comparative anatomist will contribute far more to the enduring establishment of his fame than his hypotheses as a geological theorist." And though he rejected the interpretations of leading geologists, he was emphatic that he was not in any way calling into question their professed belief in Christianity.<ref>Gisborne, Thomas, (1837), ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'', 23, 40, 59,10</ref><ref>Mortenson, T. J., 1996, ''British Scriptural Geologists in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century'', Coventry University/Wycliff Hall, Oxford, p 202</ref>
====Attitude toward science====
Nor was he opposed to science in general. The leading geologists at the time were saying that their geological theories only appeared to contradict Genesis. To this Gisborne replied:

<blockquote>
Thus it is asserted, and many attestations from commanding authorities are accumulated in the closing chapter of the first volume of Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Treatise, that discoveries in science always tend to the establishment of truth, and researches into the works of God to the confirmation of his word. The assertions are true. They justify and they recommend sedulous and sober investigation of facts. But they do not prove any given theory in explanation of the facts, nor obviate any peculiar errors ascribed to it.<ref>Gisborne, Thomas, (1837), ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'', 23.</ref>
</blockquote>
====Relationship between faith and science====
Gisborne believed that the Christian geologist had a duty not to forget his faith when doing geological study and interpretation. He was free to interpret all he wanted, but must continually bring those interpretations to the Scriptural record to see "whether that record can be shown to be capable of a fair and reasonable interpretation consistent with his theory. If the theory cannot be reconciled to such an interpretation, then the Christian geologist "must ultimately relinquish his theory or his Bible. He will not doubt where the error lies."<ref>Gisborne, Thomas, (1837), ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'', 10-11.</ref>

However, Gisborne reasoned that superficial treatment of the Scriptural passages related to creation and the Flood were in opposition to Scripture and undermined its authority and reliability, irrespective of the motives and intentions of the authors of those geological interpretations. He was not convinced by old-earth geological arguments that he should abandon what to him was the clear teaching of Scripture: a recent (cir. 6000 years) six 24-hour day creation and a global catastrophic Noachian Deluge, which by its nature would have produced most of the strata of the Earth's crust.<ref>{{harvnb|Mortenson|1996|p=211}}</ref>
