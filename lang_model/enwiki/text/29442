Dietary patterns, foods, nutrients, and other dietary constituents are closely associated with the risk for several types of [[cancer]]. And while it is not yet possible to provide quantitative estimates of the overall risks, it has been estimated that 35 percent of [[cancer]] deaths may be related to dietary factors<ref>Doll R and Peto R: The causes of cancer: Quantitative estimates of avoidable risks of cancer in the United States today.'' J Natl Cancer Inst'' (1981) 66:1191-1308</ref>.

==Reducing-risk factors==
Increasing evidence suggests that diets high in foods containing [[fibre]] (or fiber) are associated with a reduced risk for [[cancer]], especially [[cancer]] of the colon<ref>Trock B, Lanza E and Greenwald P: [[Dietary fiber]], vegetables and colon cancer: Critical review and meta-analysis of the epidemiologic evidence. J Natl Cancer Inst (1990) 82:650-661</ref>.

A few studies have also shown a reduced risk for [[cancers]] of the breast, [[rectum]], oral cavity, [[pharynx]], stomach, and other sites with diets rich in fruits, vegetables and grain products <ref>Lanza E, Shankar S and Trock B: Dietary fiber. In Macronutrients: Investigating their role in cancer. (1992) (Micozzi MS, Moon TE, eds). New York: Marcell Dekker, Inc., 293-319</ref>. Numerous studies have found evidence that [[carotenoid]]s reduce the risk of some [[cancers]]. The evidence is particularly strong for lung [[cancer]]<ref>Ziegler RG: A review of [[epidemiologic]] evidence that [[carotenoids]] reduce the risk of [[cancer]]. (1989)J Nutr 119:116-122</ref>, even after taking smoking into account. [[Vitamin C]] is found in fruits, particularly citrus fruits and juices, and in green vegetables, as well as in some fortified foods. Of a group of [[epidemiologic]] studies investigating the role of [[vitamin C]], three-fourths found that [[vitamin C]], or fruit rich in [[vitamin C]], provides significant protection<ref>Block G: Vitamin C and cancer prevention: The epidemiologic evidence. Am J Clin Nutr (1991) 53:270S-282S</ref>.

A leaner diet is believed to lower cancer risk. [[Tomato]]es, [[calcium]], other minerals, [[saponin]]s, [[sausage tree]], [[sea mat]], [[cat's claw]], and [[licorice]] are believed to prevent or suppress different kinds of cancerous tumors{{Fact|date=October 2008}}. [[Fast food]]s are said to raise cancer risk. Large amounts of alcohol increase risk for liver cancer.

==Contrary Evidence==
More recent studies have cast doubt on the claim that dietary fiber reduces the risk of colon cancer.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/12/14/doubts_cast_on_fibers_effect_on_cancer/?rss_id=Boston+Globe+--+National+News The Boston Globe, "Doubts cast on fiber's effect on cancer" By Liz Kowalczyk, December 14,2005]</ref><ref>[http://www.intelihealth.com/IH/ihtIH/WSIHW000/333/7228/300409.html  Associated Press, "Study: Fiber Doesn't Prevent Cancer" October 13, 2000]</ref>  Regarding prostate cancer, a major 2002 study concluded that "A low-fat, high-fiber diet heavy in fruits and vegetables has no impact on PSA levels in men over a four-year period, and does not affect the incidence of prostate cancer."<ref>[http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/A/2002984.html  Science Blog, August 2002,From American Society of Clinical Oncology ]</ref>

The belief that dietary fiber prevents these cancers was based on epidemiological evidence showing a very low incidence in the developing world.  Dr. [[Denis Burkitt]] was the main proponent of this theory, and his 1979 best-selling book, "Don't Forget Fibre in Your Diet," was translated into nine languages.  Less well-known is his theory, mentioned in the book, that the [[squatting defecation posture]] used in the developing world where [[Ottoman toilet]]s are more widespread than the Western world is also a preventative factor, especially for colon diseases.  Now that his fiber theory has failed numerous attempts to confirm it, his other theory is gaining more attention as a new direction for research.

==Methionine metabolism==
Although numerous cellular mechanisms are involved in food intake, many investigations over the past decades have pointed out defections in the [[methionine]] metabolic pathway as cause of cancerogenesis<ref>Mikol, Y.B., Hoover, K.L., Creasia, D., Poirier, L.A. 1983. [[Carcinogenesis]]. 4: 1619-29</ref><ref>Ghoshal, A.K., Farber, E. 1984. [[Carcinogenesis]]. 5: 1367-70</ref>. For instance, deficiencies of the main dietary sources of [[methyl]] donors, [[methionine]] and [[choline]], lead to the formation of liver [[cancer]] in rodents<ref>Newmark, H.L., Yang, K., Lipkin, M., Kopelovich, L., Liu, Y., Fan, K., Shinozaki, H. 2001 [[Carcinogenesis]]. 11: 1871-5</ref><ref>Henning, S.M., Swendseid, M.E., Coulson, W.F. 1997. J. Nutr. 127: 30-6</ref>. [[Methionine]] is an essential [[amino acid]] that must be provided by dietary intake of [[proteins]] (meat) or [[methyl]] donors ([[choline]] and [[betaine]] found in beef, eggs and some vegetables). Assimilated methionine is transformed in [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) which is a key [[metabolite]] for [[polyamine]] synthesis, e.g. [[spermidine]], and [[cysteine]] formation (see the figure on the right). [[Methionine]] breakdown products are also recycled back into [[methionine]] by [[homocysteine]] remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). Vitamins B6, B12, [[folic acid]] and [[choline]] are essential cofactors for these reactions. SAM is the substrate for [[methylation]] reactions catalyzed by DNA, RNA and protein [[methyltransferase]]s. 

[[Image:PRMTpathway.jpg|left|thumb|500px|Growth factor (GF) and steroid/retinoid activation of PRMT4.]]

The products of these reactions are [[methylated]] [[DNA]], [[RNA]] or [[proteins]] and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase [[enzymes]]. Therefore SAM:SAH ratio directly regulates cellular methylation, whereas levels of vitamins B6, B12, folic acid and [[choline]] regulates indirectly the [[methylation]] state via the [[methionine]] metabolism cycle<ref>Caudill, M.A., Wang, J.C., Melnyk, S., Pogribny, I.P., Jernigan, S., Collins, M.D., Santos-Guzman, J., Swendseid, M.E., Cogger, E.A., James, S.J. 2001.  J. Nutr. 131(11): 2811-8</ref><ref>Poirier, L.A., Wise, C.K., Delongchamp, R.R., Sinha, R. 2001. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 10: 649-55</ref>. A near ubiquitous feature of [[cancer]] is a maladaption of the [[methionine]] [[metabolic pathway]] in response to genetic or environmental conditions resulting in depletion of SAM and/or SAM-dependent [[methylation]]. Whether it is deficiency in [[enzymes]] such as methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, [[methionine]]-dependency of [[cancer]] cells, high levels of [[polyamine]] synthesis in [[cancer]], or induction of [[cancer]] through a diet deprived of extrinsic [[methyl]] donors or enhanced in [[methylation]] inhibitors, [[tumor]] formation is strongly correlated with a decrease in levels of SAM in mice, rats and humans<ref>Prinz-Langenohl, R., Fohr, I., Pietrzik, K. 2001.  Eur. J. Nut. 40: 98-105</ref><ref>Van de Veyver, I.B. 2002. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 22: 2555-82</ref>. Many indirect and thinly circumstantial theories have been put forth related to [[methylation]] status of DNA or attacks upon the capacity for DNA mutation and repair. The discovery that [[methyltransferases]] whose activity would be directly influenced by SAM levels also act as [[tumor suppressor]]s potentially provides a more direct bridge. This has important ramifications for chemoprevention strategies as well as [[chemotherapy]]<ref>McBride, A.E., Silver, P.A. 2001. Cell. 106: 5-8</ref><ref>Huang, S. 2002. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2: 469-76</ref><ref>Rea, S., Eisenbaber, F., O<U+2019>Carroll, D., Strahl, B.D., Sun, Z.W., Schmid, M. Opravil, S., Mechtler, K.  Ponting, C.P., Allis, C.D., Jenuwein, T. 2000.

== Arginine methyltransferase ==
Protein [[arginine]] N-[[methyltransferase]]-4 (PRMT4) [[methylation]] of [[arginine]] residues within [[proteins]] plays a critical key role in [[transcriptional]] regulation (see the PRMT4 pathway on the left). PRMT4 binds to the classes of [[transcriptional]] activators known as p160 and CBP/p300<ref>Zika E, et al., Interplay among coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1, CBP, and CIITA in IFN-gamma-inducible MHC-II gene expression. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Nov 8;102(45):16321-6</ref>. The modi<U+FB01>ed forms of these [[proteins]] are involved in stimulation of [[gene expression]] via steroid [[hormone receptor]]s. Signi<U+FB01>cantly, PRMT4 methylates core [[histone]]s H3 and H4, which are also targets of the [[histone]] acetylase activity of CBP/p300 coactivators. PRMT4 recruitment [[chromatin]] by binding to coactivators increases [[histone]] [[methylation]] and enhances the accessibility of [[promoter]] regions for [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. [[Methylation]] of the [[transcriptional]] coactivator CBP by PRMT4 inhibits binding to CREB and thereby partitions the limited cellular pool of CBP for [[steroid hormone]] receptor interaction.
