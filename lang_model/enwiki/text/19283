The '''Bay of Gibraltar''' (also known as '''Gibraltar Bay''' or '''Bay of Algeciras''' or '''Algeciras Bay''', direct translation of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Bah<U+00ED>a de Algeciras'', the usual name in Spain) is a [[headlands and bays|bay]] at the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide, covering an area of some {{convert|75|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with a depth of up to {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the centre of the bay. It opens to the south into the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The shoreline is densely settled. From west to east, the shore is divided between the [[Municipalities of Spain|Spanish municipalities]] of [[Algeciras]], [[Los Barrios]], [[San Roque, C<U+00E1>diz|San Roque]], [[La L<U+00ED>nea de la Concepci<U+00F3>n]] and the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. The larger part of the shoreline is Spanish territory, with part of the eastern half of the bay claimed by Gibraltar.<ref>http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb7-1_oreilly.pdf</ref>

The east and west entrances to the bay are marked respectively by the [[Europa Point Lighthouse]] at [[Europa Point]], Gibraltar and the [[Punta Carnero, Spain|Punta Carnero]] lighthouse to the west of Algeciras.

==Ecology==
The bay is a breeding area for several [[dolphin]] species, notably the [[Common Dolphin]], [[Striped Dolphin]] and [[Bottlenose Dolphin]], and is also visited by migratory [[whale]]s. It is a popular destination for tourist [[whale-watching]] trips from Algeciras or Gibraltar.

The other major draw for tourists is [[scuba diving]]: the area is rich with wrecks and historical artifacts such as crashed [[Avro Shackleton]] aircraft and [[Sherman tank]]s from the [[Second World War]], and ancient anchors from [[Phoenicia]]n and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] ships.

==Industrialisation==
[[Image:CEPSA Refinery Gibraltar-San Roque.jpg|thumb|left|200px|CEPSA oil refinery at [[San Roque, C<U+00E1>diz|San Roque]].]]

The area around the bay in Spain is heavily industrialised with extensive [[petrochemical]] installations near [[San Roque, C<U+00E1>diz|San Roque]] (such as the [[CEPSA]] [[oil refinery]] and [[Acerinox]] [[stainless steel]] manufacturing plant) and working [[port]]s in both [[port of Algeciras|Algeciras]] and Gibraltar. The bay's waters are used by a considerable number of large and medium sized ships, notably [[oil tankers]] and [[cargo ship|freighters]]. [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|Oil bunkering]] activities are also heavily carried out.

===Pollution===
[[Image:New flame sinking.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The ''New Flame'' sinking off Europa Point, 13 August 2007]]

Due to all these facts and the heavy industries along the shoreline, airborne and marine pollution are serious problems in the area. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the risks of oil spills and other types of pollution, particularly in the light of the bay's ecological importance. In May 1998, an [[Acerinox accident|accident at the Acerinox plant]] in [[Los Barrios]], caused the release of a radioactive cloud. The radiation was not detected on site, but was eventually detected in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Austria]]. The radioactive levels measured were up to 142 times higher than normal.<ref>[http://www10.antenna.nl/wise/495/4895.html Acerinox accident - Cesium-137 contamination in Europe]</ref> Due to the large number of ships that transit the strait, there is always a danger of accidents and in recent years there have been a small number of sinkings, groundings and collisions in both Gibraltar and Spain resulting in oil spills (''[[New Flame]]'', ''Spa Bunker IV'' ''Samothraki'', ''Sierra Nava'', ''Tawe'' or ''[[MV Fedra|Fedra]]'').

Last report of [[Greenpeace]] on the pollution in Spain targets the Bay of Gibraltar as suffering from "chronic pollution" due to hydrocarbons, not only as a result of accidents, but also as a consequence of regular unballast, ship-to-ship bunkering or tank cleaning operations.<ref>[http://www.esg-gib.net/hpage/database/documents/conesp1.pdf Informe Contaminaci<U+00F3>n en Espa<U+00F1>a], Greenpeace, May 2008.</ref> During 2009, environmental organizations, both Spanish and Gibraltarian, have called the Tripartite Forum to implement measures to protect the Bay of Gibraltar.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/espana/news/091112 Ecologistas de Espa<U+00F1>a y Gibraltar piden al Foro Tripartito un plan de acci<U+00F3>n para salvar la bah<U+00ED>a], Greenpeace, November 12, 2009 (Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/espana/reports/090619.pdf Crisis ambiental y de salud en la bah<U+00ED>a de Algeciras/bah<U+00ED>a de Gibraltar.

A joint statement was issued by concerned environmental groups on both sides of the frontier in relation to the trilateral forum meeting held in 2009.<ref>[http://www.gibnews.net/cgi-bin/gn_view.pl/?ESGX091116_1.xml Joint statement by groups]</ref>

===CEPSA Refinery===
The refinery continues to cause concern with close co-operation between various groups monitoring its activities. 

In 2007 a particularly serious sulphur incident happened as well as intermittent flaring episodes. The impacts of such upsets on surrounding neighbourhoods had provoked outrage and public protest which led to the Consejer<U+00ED>a de Medio Ambiente of the [[Junta de Andaluc<U+00ED>a]] to order an independent audit aimed at investigating such incidents.<ref>[http://www.esg-gib.net/hpage/database/documents/CEPSA%20AUDIT.pdf The CEPSA audit report] (in Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://www.esg-gib.net/hpage/database/documents/SP%20CEPSA%20AUDIT%20ANALYSIS%20&%20QUESTIONS.doc The CEPSA refinery audit analysis by the ESG] (in Spanish)</ref><ref>[http://www.gibnews.net/cgi-bin/gn_view.pl/?ESGX091120_1.xml ESG Statement on audit]</ref>

===Bunkering===
Fuel on ships is known as [[Bunker fuel|bunkers]], and the process of fueling termed bunkering.

Due to its geographical position on a major shipping route, Gibraltar is one of the largest bunkering ports in the Mediterranean, followed by neighbour [[Algeciras]] in Spain. The ports in the Straits <U+2014> Algeciras, [[Ceuta]] and Gibraltar <U+2014> are the second bunker market in Europe, behind the so-called Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area.<ref name="bunkerworld">[http://i.pmcdn.net/p/bw/magazine/2009/05/2009-05-Algeciras-on-the-ascent.pdf Algeciras on the ascent], bunkerworld, May/June 2009.</ref>

In Gibraltar {{convert|4300000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of bunkers were delivered in 2007 compared with just {{convert|840000|t|ST|abbr=on}} in 1990 and bunkering is now the main activity within the Port of Gibraltar. Of a total of 8,351 deep-sea vessels which called at Gibraltar in 2007, 5,640 were supplied with bunkers.<ref>[http://www.gibraltarport.com/bunkering.cfm Bunkering in Gibraltar]</ref>

Algeciras recorded bunker sales of about {{convert|2400000|t|ST|abbr=on}} in 2008. From the 24,535 vessels called at the Port of Algeciras Bay, 2,173 took bunkers.<ref name="bunkerworld"/>

==History==
[[Image:Gibraltar and Bay map 1750.jpg|thumb|260px|Map of the promotory of [[Gibraltar]] and the Bay of Gibraltar (circa 1750).]]

The area around the Bay of Gibraltar has been inhabited for millennia and the bay itself has been used by merchant shipping for at least 3,000 years. The Phoenicians are believed to have had a settlement near Gibraltar and the Romans established the town of ''Portus Alba'' ("White Port") on the site of modern Algeciras. Later peoples, notably the [[Moors]] and the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], also established settlements on the shoreline during the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern period, including the heavily fortified and highly strategic port at Gibraltar, which fell to [[England]] in 1704.

The bay's strategic position at the mouth of the Mediterranean has made it a much-contested body of water over the centuries. It has been the site of several major sea battles, notably the [[Battle of Gibraltar]] (1607) and the [[Battle of Algeciras Bay]] (1801). During the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Italy]] launched [[human torpedo]]es from Algeciras on several occasions in attempts to sink British ships moored in the Gibraltar harbour, with mixed success due to the work of [[Lionel Crabb|Commander Crabbe]].

More recently, there has been (and remains) a persistent dispute between Spain and Gibraltar over British sovereignty in the Bay of Gibraltar. Spain claims not to recognise British sovereignty in the area save for a small portion around the Port of Gibraltar, but the UK has asserts a normal {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} limit around Gibraltar, with a demarcation in the middle of the bay. This has caused tensions between the two sides, especially over the issue of Spanish fishermen operating in alleged Gibraltar territorial waters.<ref>[http://www.hydrographicsociety.org/Articles/journal/2000/95-2.htm Gerry O'Reilly, "Gibraltar: Sovereignty Disputes and Territorial Waters", in ''The Hydrographic Journal'' No 95, January 2000]</ref> Both have signed, and are bound, by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] which specifies territorial waters.<ref>[http://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm UN Law of the Seas website]</ref> After the arrest of a Spanish fishing vessel by the [[Royal Gibraltar Police]] in 1998, the problem largely subsided, although the operation of [[Odyssey Marine Exploration]] in the area is currently being contested in the Florida Court.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN2046348920080820 Peru joins in Spanish claim]</ref>
