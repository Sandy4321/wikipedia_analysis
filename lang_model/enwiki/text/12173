==Plot==
<!--As per [[WP:PLOT]], the plot should not contain more than 700 words-->

Charlie and Guddu are twins who were raised in [[Mumbai]]. Charlie [[lisp]]s while Guddu [[stuttering|stutters]]. Charlie likes to take shortcuts to fulfil his dream of becoming a [[bookmaker]] at the racecourse where he works for three criminal brothers who [[match fixing|fix races]]. He is closer to the youngest brother Mikhail than to Guddu, to whom he is hostile. A jockey deceives Charlie when he bets {{INRConvert|100|k|nolink=yes}} on a horse during a fixed race, losing all of his savings. Seeking revenge, Charlie locates the jockey in an upmarket city hotel.

At the same hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three drug dealers and collect a guitar case containing cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie and his men invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van to escape from the jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.

Meanwhile, Guddu's lover Sweety, sister of the politician Sunil Bhope, reveals that she is pregnant with Guddu's child and expresses her wish to marry Guddu. They marry later that night. Bhope hears about his sister's actions and sends his men to apprehend the lovers. Bhope's men [[gate crashing|gatecrash]] Guddu's wedding and beat him, then realise that he is a migrant from [[Uttar Pradesh]]. This enrages Bhope, who orders his men to kill Guddu and return Sweety to his house so he can [[arranged marriage|arrange a marriage]] for her. Sweety fights off her brother's henchmen and escapes with Guddu.

Charlie tells Mikhail about the cocaine, who is delighted. When Charlie returns to retrieve the case, Bhope and his men are waiting inside the van. One of Bhope's men recognises Guddu as Charlie's twin and Bhope demands that Charlie reveal Guddu's whereabouts. An inebriated Mikhail interrupts their conversation and is killed by Bhope.

On the way to the airport, Guddu realises that Sweety has faked her identity. At a petrol station, Lobo and Lele notice the pair. Mistaking Guddu for Charlie, they arrest him. They assault Guddu, refusing to believe that he is Charlie's twin brother until Guddu's mobile phone rings; the caller is revealed to be Bhope. Lobo and Lele agree to exchange Charlie for Guddu and Sweety on a train. The policemen take Guddu and Sweety to Bhope's house, where Bhope reveals that a local builder will pay him {{INRConvert|50|m|nolink=yes}} to marry Sweety to the builder's son. Guddu bargains with Bhope{{mdash}}if he retrieves the cocaine-filled guitar case for Bhope, he will get Sweety. Bhope sends his henchmen with Guddu to retrieve the guitar case from Charlie's house.

The policemen assault Charlie, who refuses to negotiate, realising that the policemen are in as much trouble as himself. Charlie outwits the policemen, takes them hostage and negotiates with Tashi to exchange the guitar case for {{INRConvert|1|m|nolink=yes}}. Charlie sends the policemen to deliver the details to Tashi and returns to his house to retrieve the cocaine. At Charlie's house, Guddu arrives with Bhope's men. Sweety hears about Bhope's plans to kill Guddu and shoots at the members of her household. Guddu finds the case and fights Charlie, who lets Guddu go. Guddu takes the cocaine to the police, who [[Covert listening device|bug]] him. Guddu arrives at Bhope's house the same time as Tashi and his gang, with Charlie as their hostage. Bhope and Tashi negotiate to trade the drugs, but Charlie snatches the guitar case and threatens to destroy it if Guddu and Sweety are not released. The lovers escape as the police arrive, leading to a shooting spree in which the cocaine is destroyed. Charlie's bosses arrive to avenge Mikhail's death, but are killed along with Bhope, Tashi and their henchmen. Charlie is shot and wounded.

Sweety gives birth to Guddu's twins and Charlie opens a bookmaking counter at the racecourse. Charlie is engaged to Sophia, a woman earlier featured in his dream.

The media showed concern over the film's title, deeming it "odd", and some people were shocked because of the title, which can be translated into English as "mean".<ref name="title">{{cite web|title=Kaminey not an abuse, it's an endearment: Gulzar|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Kaminey-not-an-abuse-it-s-an-endearment-Gulzar/Article1-445941.aspx|author=Jha, Subhash K.|work=Hindustan Times|date=22 August 2009|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="title2">{{cite web|title='The person behind the camera is the most kamina'|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/aug/17/slide-show-1-vishal-bharadwaj-on-kaminey.htm?print=true|author=N., Patcy|publisher=Rediff.com|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> However, the makers said that "kaminey" is not a negative term and is actually a term of endearment.<ref name="title"/> According to Bhardwaj, the idea for the title came from a scene from [[Gulzar]]'s ''[[Ijaazat]]'' (1987), in which the lead actor ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) refers to the actress in a loving manner; it was the first time that he heard the word used that way.<ref name="title2"/> Bhardwaj told [[Rediff]], "when the script of this film was written, it was like discovering your own mean side. The format of the film is of a caper and all the characters in this film, excluding one, has an agenda. So I thought it was an apt title for the film".<ref name="title2"/>

===Casting===
Shahid Kapoor was cast in the film's lead role. Several media outlets reported that Bhardwaj considered many actors before casting Kapoor in the role, which he refused.<ref name="script"/> Bhardwaj refuted the claims, saying, "There is a huge difference between discussing and narrating and offering someone a film and I would like to clear up the rumour by saying that Kaminey was never offered to anyone else and so no one rejected it."<ref name="script"/> Kapoor said that he accepted the role after reading the script. Priyanka Chopra was cast to play Sweety, the lead female role. She initially turned down the role, saying she felt it was a boys' film and her eight-scene part did not seem good enough.

Bhardwaj instructed the film's entire cast and crew to watch caper classics such as ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' (1998), ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]'' (2000), ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994) and ''[[True Romance]]'' (1993) to study the nuances and become familiar with the genre.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kaminey team studied to get it right!|url=http://www.bollywood.com/kaminey-team-studied-guy-ritchie-and-tarantinos-caper-classics|author=Tuteja, Joginder|publisher=Bollywood.com|date=17 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141120071852/http://www.bollywood.com/kaminey-team-studied-guy-ritchie-and-tarantinos-caper-classics|archivedate=20 November 2014}}</ref> Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had its own challenges. Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.<ref name="two">{{cite web|title=Two in one|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090813/jsp/entertainment/story_11353178.jsp|author=Gupta, Pratim D.|work=The Telegraph|date=13 August 2009|accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>

Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him." Chopra described both her character and herself as being "outspoken and fun loving" as well as honest and unable to "hide something that is wrong".

==Themes and influences==
According to the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', ''Kaminey'' "is the first attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner."<ref name="ht" /> Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is [[Sita]], the protagonist is [[Rama]] and the antagonist is [[Ravana]], the characters in ''Kaminey'' are nuanced humans in "layered and complex" situations.<ref name="ht">{{cite web|title=Review: Kaminey|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Reviews/Review-Kaminey/Article1-445201.aspx|author=Chaturvedi, Keshav|work=Hindustan Times|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=25 June 2013}}</ref> Namrata Joshi from ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' wrote that ''Kaminey'' reflects Bhardwaj's "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters on the margins of society and the morally compromised".<ref name="outlook"/> Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with "themes that affect our lives directly", and "is a reminder that we all have a dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side".<ref name="rediff"/> Rakesh Bedi from ''[[The Economic Times]]'' wrote, "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands.

When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage.

Vishal Bhardwaj composed the music soundtrack for '' Kaminey'' and Gulzar wrote the lyrics. The album contains five original songs, two remixes and one theme song; it was released on 6 July 2009. Vishal Bhardwaj stated that the song "Dhan Te Nan" was not originally composed for the film, but for an episode of the television series ''Gubbare'' titled ''Dhan Te Nan''. The soundtrack album was commercially successful after its release, especially "Dhan Te Nan", which topped the charts across various platforms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is it the R.D hangover?|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/08/21/stories/2009082150220100.htm|author=Dundoo, Sangeetha Devi|work=The Hindu|date=21 August 2009|accessdate=30 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Singing a new tune|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/singinganewtune/524619/|author=Singh, Ayesha Dominica-Mishra, Arunima|work=The Financial Express|date=4 October 2009|accessdate=30 May 2013}}</ref>

The soundtrack album received positive reviews from music critics. [[Rediff.com]] rated the album 4.5 out of 5, labelled it a "masterpiece" and wrote, "Bhardwaj has delivered a soundtrack that is lethally explosive. Not that we expected anything less.

The makers of the film were disappointed by the [[Central Board of Film Certification|Censor Board for Film Certification]]'s decision to grant the film an "[[Central Board of Film Certification#Rating System|A]]" certificate{{mdash}}meant for viewers 18 years or older{{mdash}}instead of a "[[Central Board of Film Certification#Rating System|U/A]]" certificate that they had expected. Bhardwaj said, "It was injustice to us. There is no abusive language used in the film and the violence is of 'comic book kind'." The Censor Board asked him to replace dialogue which mentioned the city of [[Pilibhit]]{{mdash}}which they said was a sensitive constituency{{mdash}}with a fictitious city name.

A [[First Information Report]] was filed by Jagannath Sena Sangathan at a police station in [[Puri]] against the film for allegedly denigrating [[Lord Jagannath]].

''Kaminey'' received unanimously positive reviews from critics who praised every aspect of the film.

And yet Kaminey is so original and inventive in the manner in which it takes Bollywood's favorite formula{{mdash}}twin brothers{{mdash}}and turns it on its head." He praised the writing{{mdash}}which he said was the film's real strength, the non-linear screenplay and the dialogue, and wrote that the film has "the best performance you will see by an ensemble cast in a long time".<ref name="cnn"/> [[Nikhat Kazmi]] from ''[[The Times of India]]'' rated the film 4 out of 5, and said it is "Bollywood's first film which is full of brains, brawn and belligerence besides being a bravura attempt to rewrite the tried and tested idiom of desi movielore.

[[Anupama Chopra]] gave a rating of 4 out of 5 and wrote "Kaminey is the best Bollywood film I've seen this year. It's an audacious, original rollercoaster ride.
