This is a list of [[Marines (One Piece)|naval marine]] characters in the anime and manga series [[One Piece]].

<!--Please add some info on Navy characters that appear or are named only in the Red / Blue data books. Info on filler Marines should go on the Filler Characters page.-->

===Fleet Admiral===
The rank of Fleet Admiral is carried by only one Marine in the Navy, and is the highest rank within the organization. He oversees Naval operations from Naval Headquarters on the Grand Line.

====Sengoku====

[[Image:Sengoku.png|right|thumb|Fleet Admiral Sengoku]]

{{nihongo|'''Fleet Admiral Sengoku'''|<U+30BB><U+30F3><U+30B4><U+30AF><U+5143><U+5E25>|Sengoku Gensui}}, nicknamed {{nihongo|"'''the Buddha'''"|<U+4ECF>|Hotoke}}, is the supreme commander of all Naval forces in the One Piece world, his status apparent by the life-size seagull attached to his hat. He oversees the workings of the Navy from his base in the Sanctuary of ''Marie Joie'', and is subordinate only to the leaders of the World Government, the [[Five Elder Stars#Gor<U+014D>sei|Gor<U+014D>sei]] (<U+4E94><U+8001><U+661F>). He also has a pet goat. Note that "Sengoku" can be written in kanji as <U+6226><U+56FD>, meaning  "warring states," which is a [[Sengoku period|period of Japanese history]]. He was the one who, twenty years ago, as an admiral entrusted the [[Golden Den Den Mushi]] to [[Cipher Pol#Spandine|Spandine]], allowing him to order the Buster Call on Ohara. He also seems to dislike the [[Shichibukai]] like [[Commodore Smoker]].

Sengoku is considered by Whitebeard as one of the few people that know the seas from the time of Gold Roger.

===Admiral===
There are only three Marines with the title of Admiral in the Navy of One Piece. They are known by their aliases, "Blue Pheasant" (Aokiji), "Red Dog" (Akainu), and "Yellow Monkey" (Kizaru). Aokiji and Akainu, who both appeared in Robin's flashback to the Buster Call that wiped out her home island of Ohara, have been referred to by their real names, while Kizaru remains unseen and anonymous. The three admirals and the Fleet Admiral are the only Marines within the Navy who are capable of issuing Buster Calls, which dispatch 10 warships commanded by 5 Vice-Admirals to obliterate a specific target.

====Aokiji====
{{main|Aokiji}}

====Akainu====
* '''[[Seiyu]]:''' [[Michio Nakao]]
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?
'''Akainu, the "Red Dog"''' (<U+8D64><U+30A4><U+30CC> <U+5927><U+5C06> Akainu Taish<U+014D>) , Known as Vice Admiral Sakazuki before his promotion, was present at the Ohara incident. He ordered the destruction of a ship of civilians, claiming it needed to be destroyed in case any scholars snuck on board. His entire face is not seen during his appearance, as it is hidden by his marine cap and the hood of his jacket. He believes in "absolute justice", and eliminating all "evil", which is against Aokiji's way of thinking. In the G8 anime filler arc, Commander Jonathan claims to be friends with Akainu.
<br style="clear:both">

====Kizaru====
* '''[[Seiyu]]: ?'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?
'''Kizaru, the "Yellow Monkey"<!-- Yes, this is an ethnic slur, but it's also the literal translation of the name. Keep it. -->,''' is the third of the three Admirals. Nothing is known about him aside from his alias, as his only appearance in the series so far has been a silhouette. He has also been seen with a hat on his head.

===Vice-Admiral===
A Vice-Admiral is the Navy Rank under Admirals, they may often act as assistants to Admirals, or act independently under the command of the World Government. One of the official duties of Vice Admirals is to participate and lead Buster Calls.

====The vice-admirals of the Buster Call on Enies Lobby====
[[Image:ViceAdmirals.jpg|frame|right||The five Vice-Admirals leading the '''Buster Call''' on Enies Lobby.  They are (from left to right) Strawberry, Yamakaji, Doberman, Onigumo, and Momongo.]]
These are the five vice-admirals that attacked Enies Lobby.  Four of their faces were grim on approach, and the fifth one appeared to always smile.  It is unknown if any of them will be introduced.  

Three of them have been unofficially introduced, and were named in the One Piece: Yellow data book. 

* Strawberry, (<U+30B9><U+30C8><U+30ED><U+30D9><U+30EA>, ''Sutoroberi'')  seems to have a level of comradeship, saving every sailor trapped on Enies Lobby, and refused to attack the Franky Family before the sailors were evacuated.It was he who ordered the atack on Oimo,Kaashi,the shipwrights from Galley-La and Franky Family members.  

* Yamakaji (<U+30E4><U+30DE><U+30AB><U+30B8>, ''Yamakaji''), the jolly one, has only been seen once since the panel above.In the anime,he appeared on a few more panles to fill up space.

* Doberman (<U+30C9><U+30FC><U+30D9><U+30EB><U+30DE><U+30F3>, ''D<U+014D>beruman''), who is covered in scars, was the one to reveal [[Rob Lucci|Rob Lucci's]] past to the readers, and seems to respect his lower-ranking sailors. He also appears to be level-headed as he maintained his grim face after seeing Lucci's defeat by Luffy. He also seem to bear some level of insight for when Spandam ordered the marines to continue their assault, he merely remained indifferent. But nevertheless focused his eyes over to Spandam, suggesting that he saw through his lie that the latter was "given" a direct order from Aokiji to obliterate the Straw Hats.
In the anime he is seen in advance before the others,wearing his red cape,however this version was only seen once and at the end of episode 301 he was given an all new look.

*Onigumo (<U+30AA><U+30CB><U+30B0><U+30E2>, ''Onigumo''), the smoking one in the helmet, seems to have morals similar to those of Axe-Hand Morgan and Akainu, having ordered the attack force to fire upon the ship that Luffy and Rob Lucci were fighting over. This resulted in the deaths of up to 1000 sailors, as well as a sailor that argued against the Vice Admiral's orders.He is last seen yellign isnults at the personel of the gate of justice for closing it down (in reality it was closed up by [[Sanji]]) .

*Momongo (<U+30E2><U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30B4>, ''Momongo''), the one with the mohawk has been seen in a few other panels, but has so far proven to only fill up extra space in panels.In the Anime,he is seen in a few panels more.

====Monkey D. Garp====
[[Image:Monkey D. Garp.png|thumb|right|Vice Admiral Garp]]

'''Vice-Admiral Monkey D. Garp''' (<U+30E2><U+30F3><U+30AD><U+30FC><U+30FB>D<U+30FB><U+30AC><U+30FC><U+30D7><U+4E2D><U+5C06>, ''Monk<U+012B> D. G<U+0101>pu Ch<U+016B>j<U+014D>'') , nicknamed '''Garp the Fist''', is the commanding officer of the Navy's 153rd Branch, and captain of a ship easily the size of a Buster Call warship. He is famous for his pursuit of Pirate King, Gol D. Roger, which suggested he is very powerful. It seems that he and Admiral Aokiji know each other very well (Garp even shouted at Aokiji after Fleet Admiral Sengoku ordered him to attack Luffy and his friends) He is the man in charge of both [[Navy (One Piece)#Koby|Koby]] and [[Navy (One Piece)#Helmeppo|Helmeppo]], whom he took under his wing in Koby's mini-arc, where Garp made his first appearance. Garp was supposed to oversee the final transfer of ex-captain [[Axe-Hand Morgan]] to prison, but Morgan escaped by taking his own son hostage. Garp stopped his ship from blasting Morgan and Helmeppo out of the water, and allowed Koby and Helmeppo to stay, impressed that Helmeppo stood up to his father, and that Koby was willing to sacrifice himself for his friend. He is something of a father figure to the two of them, and helps keep their unorthodox behavior in check so that they can achieve their dreams. Garp also displays a fondness for eating [[doughnuts]], as well as a tendency to fall asleep, and stay asleep at inappropriate moments; he even slept while being slashed by Axe-hand Morgan (this trait is also seen in [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]] and [[Monkey D. Luffy|Luffy]], who also tend to fall asleep and stay asleep at strange times, even during the heat of fighting). His flagship is notable for possessing a dog head shaped bow and the cabins and crow's nests being shaped as dog houses.

He is the sixth character to possess the initial of [[The Will of D|D]], and shows many of the characteristic traits.

'''Trivia'''

*While unnamed Garp was introduced in [[Romance Dawn#"Romance Dawn", Version 2|Romance Dawn: version 2]], the precursor to One Piece (featured in '''[[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine''' itself) as [[Monkey D. Luffy|Luffy's]] Grandfather, here he is a pirate captain, a complete opposite of his current occupation.

====Tsuru====
* '''[[Seiyu]]: ?'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?
[[Image:Tsuru.png|right|thumb|Vice-Admiral Tsuru the Great Tactician]]

'''Vice-Admiral Tsuru''' (<U+3064><U+308B><U+4E2D><U+5C06> ''Tsuru Ch<U+016B>j<U+014D>'') the "'''Great Tactician'''" (<U+5927><U+53C2><U+8B00> ''Dai-Sanb<U+014D>'') is one of Sengoku's direct subordinates at the base in the Sanctuary of ''Marie Joie''. Tsuru seems to act as an information supplier to Sengoku, as seen when Lafitte appears at the gathering at Marie Joie (Tsuru informing Sengoku was only in the original manga. In the anime, she has not spoken yet, and Sengoku was informed about Lafitte by another officer.) . She was present for the gathering of the [[Shichibukai]] to choose a replacement for [[Sir Crocodile]].

Eiichiro Oda seems to enjoy naming women after birds. The tradition continues with Tsuru, whose name means "Crane."
<br style="clear:both">

====Komir====
'''Vice-Admiral Komir''' (<U+30B3><U+30FC><U+30DF><U+30EB><U+4E2D><U+5C06> ''K<U+014D>miru Ch<U+016B>j<U+014D>'') is the commander of Naval Base G2 in [[Portgas D. Ace|Ace]]'s [[One Piece#Chapter Title Page .22Mini-Arcs.22|chapter title-page mini-story.]] Komir's administrative meetings are plagued by bitter [[coffee]], as Ace witnesses firsthand when he infiltrates the base posing as a Naval officer. Though Ace's cover is blown, he ends up saving the day by reuniting the milkmaiden Moda with her parents on the Naval Grocery Ship. This ensures a steady supply of milk to Base G2, as well as pleasant meetings with tasty coffee for the Vice-Admiral.

====Jaguar D. Saulo====
* '''Seiyuu: [[Takeshi Kusao]]'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?

[[Image:Vice-Admiral Jaguar D. Saulo.jpg|thumb|right|Vice-Admiral Jaguar D. Saulo]]
'''Vice-Admiral Jaguar D. Saulo''' (<U+30CF><U+30B0><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30EB><U+30FB>D<U+30FB><U+30B5><U+30A6><U+30ED><U+4E2D><U+5C06> ''Haguw<U+0101>ru D. Sauro Ch<U+016B>j<U+014D>'') is a former Naval officer introduced in [[Nico Robin|Nico Robin's]] flashback during the Enies Lobby arc. Saulo is a [[One Piece terms#Giants|giant]], but unlike previously introduced giants in the One Piece manga, Saulo did not originate from the [[viking]]-inspired warrior's paradise, Elbaf. Saulo is also characterized as having a unique, but awkward laugh ("Dereshi") that he finds somewhat embarrassing.

Saulo is the fifth character in the series <!-- After Roger, Luffy, Ace, and Blackbeard --> to possess a "D" as his middle initial, and was the first to explain that the "D" is in fact a family or clan-name. This is used as a basis for the theory that he and/or Gol D. Roger are related to Monkey D. Luffy 

While on duty, Saulo's vessel encountered a wanted ship run by the Archaeologists of Ohara, who left West Blue to locate and decipher the mysterious Poneglyphs that bear an ancient, forgotten history of the One Piece world. Despite ordering his men to take the archaeologists alive, Saulo's crew slaughtered all but one; Nico Olvia, the mother of future Straw Hat crew member Nico Robin. After her capture, Saulo was informed by Sengoku that he would be one of the five chosen Vice Admirals to lead a Buster Call against the Ohara for its crimes of deciphering the Poneglyphs. Rejecting the study of history as a justification for the order, Saulo, like Smoker, would begin to doubt the Naval doctrine of "[[Navy (One Piece)#"Absolute Justice" vs. "Moral Justice"|Absolute Justice]]". 

After interrogating Olvia, Saulo grew disgusted with the military's brutal intentions and defected against the World Government by releasing her. Shortly thereafter, he was shipwrecked in a storm, then sent adrift in the ocean until fatefully landing on Ohara itself. There, he met and befriended Nico Robin and was reunited with Nico Olvia. After promising Olvia to ensure Robin's safety, Saulo was frozen by Vice Admiral Kuzan (Aokiji). As he was being frozen, Saulo smiled and laughed.  Because Saulo had been good friends with Aokiji, Aokiji let Robin go according to Saulo's wishes.

====John Giant====
* '''[[Seiyu]]: ?'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?
'''Vice-Admiral John Giant''' (<U+30B8><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+30FB><U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30A4><U+30A2><U+30F3><U+30C8><U+4E2D><U+5C06> ''Jon Jaianto Ch<U+016B>j<U+014D>'') is one of the naval officers shown in the Naval Headquarters during the announcement of Luffy's first bounty. At that time he was giving a speech regarding the doctrine of "Absolute Justice". His name and rank are revealed in One Piece Blue.<ref name="opblue1">''One Piece Blue: Grand Data File'' - Chapter 2, Characters Directory.</ref>
He has been recently seen directing the preparation of the [[Buster Call]] on [[Enies Lobby]] .

===Commodore===
====Purin-Purin====
* '''[[Seiyu]]: [[Tetsu Inada]]'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?
'''Commodore Purin-Purin''' (<U+30D7><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+30D7><U+30EA><U+30F3><U+51C6><U+5C06> ''Purinpurin Junsh<U+014D>'') is a Naval officer in the Navy's 77th Branch, who is dispatched to Arlong Park to evacuate the survivors of [[Arlong|Arlong's]] tyrannical reign. He never arrives. When Purin-Purin sees the fish-man's base, [[Hubris#Hubris in modern times|hubris]] gets the better of the Commodore, and he orders an attack. This provokes Arlong's ire, and the fish-man crew makes quick work of Purin-Purin and his ship, sending it to the bottom of the sea in an artificial [[maelstrom]].

*Note: "Purin" means "pudding".

====Smoker====
{{For|info on this character|Smoker (One Piece)}}

===Captain===
====Morgan====
[[Image:Axe Hand Morgan.jpg|right|thumb|Axe Hand Morgan]]Axe-Hand Morgan is called "Axe-Hand" as he literally has an axe for a right arm. Axe-Hand Morgan is one of the first major enemies [[Monkey D. Luffy]] has to face.  He is [[Navy (One Piece)#Helmeppo|Helmeppo's]] father and was a captain in the Marines.  

Morgan was the soldier that survived an attack by [[Captain Kuro|Kuro]] on a Navy ship, which left him with a broken jaw, and was hypnotized by Jango into believing that he had captured Kuro (which was in reality nothing but a lookalike pirate), setting off his road to his Navy status.<ref name="SBS1"> [[One Piece terms#SBS|SBS questions:]] ''One Piece Manga'' - Vol.6 Chapter 50, Kuro and Morgan's story explained </ref>

Early in the storyline, Morgan acted as a [[Navy (One Piece)|Marine]] Captain, governing over the small marine base island of Shell Town. Contrary to his duty, Morgan instead ruled the town by fear by abusing his rank and position to levy high taxes over the people, and even personally executing his own men if they dared question his orders. His spoiled little son, [[Navy (One Piece)#Helmeppo|Helmeppo]], was just as bad at using his father's rank to get what he wished from the island's inhabitants, acting however he saw fit to abuse the townsfolk. This all changes however when Luffy comes to town to help [[Navy (One Piece)#Koby|Koby]] fulfil his dream and possibly recruit [[Roronoa Zoro]] into his crew. After Luffy accidentally breaks a newly finished statue of Morgan, Axe-Hand immediately sets after him, confronting Luffy in the courtyard of the marine base. Morgan was easily defeated by Luffy without even landing a single blow against the Straw Hat, and was promptly finished off by Zoro as Luffy had to do with Helmeppo who was holding Koby hostage.

Last seen of Morgan in the series was in a chapter cover mini-arc (single panels that often show what later happens to previous characters), where the deposed captain was about to face his execution. During this story, starring Koby, Morgan manages to escape the Navy ship by using his own son as a hostage. Helmeppo disowns him shortly after and returns to the Navy, leaving Morgan alone and drifting the ocean. He was later seen passing past Jango's ship in Jango's mini-arc, but they were both asleep. His current whereabouts are unknown.

'''Trivia'''

*Helmeppo was drawn before his father and early drawings of Morgan greatly resembled Helmeppo's own appearance.  One example had him almost identical to Helmeppo, with just a crazier hairstyle.  He was given his final design after the editor told Oda he looked lame. Morgan's original name was going to be 'Captain Chop'.  Oda explained that he didn't have the nerve to actually use this name. (His name also apparently was similar to a wrestling move by a famous Japanese wrestler called [[Shohei Baba|Giant Baba]]).
*Morgan's mouthpiece has the word "M<U+00F6>we" written on it. M<U+00F6>we means "[[sea gull]]" in [[German language|German]].<ref name="SBS2"> [[One Piece terms#SBS|SBS questions:]] ''One Piece Manga'' - Vol.5 Chapter 43, Fan Question: What does the word on Morgan's chin "M<U+00F6>we" mean? </ref>
*Oda admitted that Morgan was based on a real-life pirate, most likely [[Henry Morgan]], who also began his career as a law-abiding seafarer.

====Nezumi====
* '''[[Seiyuu]]:'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[4Kids Entertainment]]): [[Dan Green]]'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?

'''Captain Nezumi''' (<U+30CD><U+30BA><U+30DF><U+5927><U+4F50> ''Nezumi Taisa'') is a Naval Officer of the Navy's 16th Branch, in the East Blue. His appearance and manner are rodent-like (as "''nezumi''" is Japanese for both "[[mouse]]" and "[[rat]]"), and he is arrogant and decidedly corrupt. Nezumi takes bribes from [[Arlong]], so the fish-man pirate can keep a low profile. Acting on a tip from Arlong, he uncovers the treasure that [[Nami (One Piece)|Nami]] had been hoarding in order to buy back Cocoyashi Village (Coco Village in the English dub), and confiscates it from her. After Arlong is defeated, Nezumi attempts to intervene against the [[Straw Hat Pirates]], but he is quickly defeated. His report back to his superiors is what prompts the Navy to assign Luffy with his first bounty. Like several characters in One Piece, Nezumi has a unique laugh ("Hyik hyki hyik"!).
<br style="clear:both">

====Hina====
[[Image:Th hina.jpg |thumb|right|Captain Hina]] 
* '''[[Seiyuu]]: [[Tomoko Naka]]'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[4Kids Entertainment]]): [[Kathleen Delaney]]'''
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):''' ?

'''Captain Hina''' (<U+30D2><U+30CA><U+5927><U+4F50> ''Hina Taisa'') is an officer in the Navy, and the object of both [[#Jango|Jango]] and [[Navy (One Piece)#Fullbody 2|Fullbody's]] affections. She has received the nickname "Hina the Black Cage" (<U+9ED2><U+6ABB><U+306E><U+30D2><U+30CA> ''Kuro-Ori no Hina'') because of her Ori Ori no Mi (<U+30AA><U+30EA><U+30AA><U+30EA><U+306E><U+5B9F>) ability, which allows her to form restraints on people by swiping her limbs through them. Hina has a tendency to speak in the third person, though this only seems to add to her attractiveness for her subordinates. It is usual for young children in Japan to refer to themselves by using their own name. This is seen as "cute". For her part, however, she coldly spurns any advances made towards her.  She treats Jango and Fullbody very well, giving them their own two ships, allowing them to wear their own clothes, and assigning them special assassination tasks. 

She is a long-time friend of Captain/Commodore Smoker, joining the Navy at the same time as him, and helping him getting out of situations where Smoker could have been fired.

She is 32 years old.  <ref name="SBS1"> [[One Piece terms#SBS|SBS questions:]] ''One Piece Manga'' - Vol.27 - Chapter 248, Fan question: What are the profiles of Smoker and Hina? </ref>

In a recent Japanese Fan Poll, Hina is currently ranked the 36th most popular character in One Piece.

====T-Bone====
* '''[[Seiyuu]]:'''[[Tomomichi Nishimura]]
* '''Voice Actor ([[FUNimation]]):'''

[[Image:Captain T-Bone2.jpg|thumb|right|Captain T-Bone]]
'''Captain T-Bone''' (<U+FF34><U+30DC><U+30FC><U+30F3><U+5927><U+4F50> ''T<U+012B>-B<U+014D>n Taisa'') is a Naval officer working with the Government-employed agency CP9.Before becoming a marine, he was a knight of a kingdom. 
He was assigned to help escort the CP9 agents to Enies Lobby, the Judicial Heaquarters of the World Government on the Grand Line, where T-Bone is usually stationed. T-Bone is also known as the "'''Ship-Cutter'''" (<U+8239><U+5207><U+308A> ''Funegiri''), for his mastery of swordsmanship allows him to slice open large objects (like ships or [[List of One Piece animals#Sea King|Sea Kings]]). This skill is similar to something that Hawk-Eye Mihawk can do.  T-Bone has a hideous face, but he is a very honorable and considerate person, and absolutely abhors needless violence. When he sees an injured comrade, he will always tear a piece of fabric off his own cloak to use as a bandage for each of his men's wounds, and will protect them from harm. His attacks are composed of creating a blue line of energy which acts as a blade. This is powerful enough to cut through trains, boats, and sea kings.

After his car is detached from The Sea Train, Puffing Tom, T-Bone sets out on the tracks by himself, seeking help. He is defeated and knocked into the sea by Roronoa Zoro as Rocketman, the prototype Sea Train, speeds down the tracks.

In a recent Japanese Fan Poll, T-Bone is currently ranked the 40th most popular character in One Piece.
<br style="clear:both">

===Commander===
====Ripper====
'''Commander Ripper''' was one of [[Axe-Hand Morgan|Axe-Hand Morgan's]] officers at his base in the [[East Blue]]. After Morgan's defeat, he takes control of the base's operations. He allows [[Luffy]] and [[Zoro]] to escape for ending Morgan's tyranny, and later puts himself on food restrictions for doing so. He is the one who also allows Koby, and forces Helmeppo, to join the Navy.

===Lieutenant-Commander===
====Brandnew====
Brandnew is a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, who appears at a base while Luffy and crew are en route to Logue Town. He is the officer who announces Luffy's first bounty of 30 million Belis.

===Lieutenant===
====Fullbody====
:''See [[Navy (One Piece)#Fullbody 2|below]].''

===Lieutenant Junior Grade===
====Hexagon====
{{nihongo|'''Lieutenant Junior Grade Hexagon'''|<U+30ED><U+30C3><U+30AB><U+30AF><U+4E2D><U+5C09>|Rokkaku Ch<U+016B>i}} was one of Axe-Hand Morgan's officers at his [[East Blue]] base. When Hexagon refused Morgan's order to kill [[One Piece minor characters#Rika|Rika]], Morgan killed Hexagon with his axe-hand (he was knocked into a coma in the English anime, with Morgan using the blunt end of his axe-hand). His name apparently comes from a villain in Romance Dawn v.2, a prototypical One Piece manga. This is the only resemblance between the characters. Interestingly, Hexagon has a face shaped like his namesake.

===Ensign===
====Tashigi====

* '''Birthday:''' October 6th <ref name="Tashigi1"> [[One Piece terms#SBS|SBS questions:]] ''One Piece Manga'' Vol.33 Chapter 311, Fan question: Tashigi's birthdate suggestion? </ref> 
[[Image:Tashigi.jpg<U+200E>|right|thumb|Then-Master CPO Tashigi.]]
{{nihongo|'''Ensign Tashigi'''|<U+305F><U+3057><U+304E><U+5C11><U+5C09>|Tashigi Sh<U+014D>i}} is a Naval officer serving under Commodore Smoker. She was first introduced, at the rank of Master CPO, when the Straw Hat Pirates docked in Loguetown. Smoker, her commanding officer, seems to regard her as a prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>; the two work very well together and share what appears to be almost a father-daughter relationship. While adept at sword fighting, she is unusually clumsy (almost killing herself with her own sword on one occasion), as pointed out by a swords shop owner when she ran into a stack of swords ("HEY were you born clumsy or did you practice"), which tends to gets on Smoker's nerves. She is also very well-versed in famous katana, knowing their names and origins. Tashigi wields the [[Swords in One Piece#Shigure|Shigure]], a Wazamono sword (sharp sword), Smoker hints that she has a habit of talking to her own swords.

Tashigi's stated goal is to remove all ''Meit<U+014D>'' (named swords with prestigious histories) from the hands of those who would use them for their own ends. After meeting [[Roronoa Zoro]] (whom she had inadvertently helped pick new swords before she learned his name), she set out to sea with Smoker, chasing after him and the rest of the Straw Hat crew. So far the sword she is known to have collected is [[Swords in One Piece#Kash.C5.AB|Kash<U+016B>]].

Like Smoker, Tashigi has her own view of "Justice" which differs from the Navy's own definition, and will fight for what she sees as the right thing to do. During the battle for Alabasta, Tashigi is badly wounded while fighting against [[Nico Robin]], and bears witness to the triumph of Luffy and his crew in the name of their friends. Though association with pirates is a serious offense, neither she nor Smoker feel the need to pursue any charges against the Royal Family of Alabasta, opting instead to continue sailing the Grand Line.

When he first saw Tashigi, Zoro was instantly struck by how much Tashigi looks like his deceased childhood friend Kuina (so shocked that, in the anime, he accidentally crushed Tashigi's glasses in his hand and leaves her money to pay for them but ironically she already had new glasses). It is a promise made with Kuina that motivates Zoro to be the greatest swordsman in the world, and Kuina left him the [[Swords in One Piece#Wad.C5.8D Ichimonji|Wad<U+014D> Ichimonji]], his greatest treasure. It remains to be seen if there is a more than coincidental connection between Kuina and Tashigi.  

[[Image:Tashigi as she appeared in 439.JPG|right|thumb|Tashigi as she appeared in 439]]Tashigi's most recent appearance is in chapter 439, receiving word of the Straw Hats after their fight against the Buster Call.  While trying to relay the news to Smoker, she ends up telling another sailor, since she wasn't wearing her glasses. This event also marks the full debut (after a single image on the cover of chapter 432) of a markedly different "look" for her. Despite her change in artwork she hasn't changed one bit since her last appearance as she is still the timid bumbling and clumsy assistant to Smoker. However, it is not clear whether this is an intentional redesign, or simply a result of the author's continually evolving art style and the length of time she had been out of the spotlight.
 
=====Trivia=====
* Tashigi is 170cm tall and 21 years old, the same age that [[Kuina]] would be if she were alive today.
* Since Tashigi is clumsy (''toroi'' in Japanese), her birthday is October 6. In Japanese, the numbers 10 and 6 can be pronounced "to" and "ro" respectively.
* In Japanese Fan Polls, Tashigi is currently the 20th most popular character.
* Tashigi is a playable character in  ''[[One Piece Grand Adventure]]'' {US exclusive} and "[[One Piece Grand Battle: 2]]" {Japan exclusive}

{{nihongo|'''Master Chief Petty Officer Koby'''|<U+30B3><U+30D3><U+30FC><U+66F9><U+9577>|Kob<U+012B> S<U+014D>ch<U+014D>}} is the first person Luffy meets on his haphazard journey. A small, timid, bespectacled boy, Koby had intended to board a ship for a fishing trip one day, but by accident, instead found himself amid the dangerous crew of Lady Alvida. To stay alive, he 'volunteered' to become a lowly cabin boy for this band of pirates, but fostered a desire to escape one day, and even join the Navy. His fear of Alvida prevented him from leaving, but Luffy's arrival and triumph over the 'ugly old hag' (as Koby summoned the courage to call her) finally brought him hope. After helping Luffy and Zoro free a nearby Naval base from the grip of the tyrannical [[Axe-Hand Morgan|Captain Morgan]], Koby is admitted to join the Navy and become a Marine as a {{nihongo|Chore Boy|<U+96D1><U+7528>|Zatsuy<U+014D>|lit. "various tasks"}}, alongside the Captain's disgraced son Helmeppo.

In his and Helmeppo's [[One Piece Story Arcs#Chapter Title Page .22Mini-Arcs.22|title page mini-arc]], the two become unwillingly involved in an escape attempt by Morgan the prisoner (Morgan takes his son hostage and steals a ship). Though Morgan escapes, the bravery shown by the two earns them the respect of their superiors, and the attention of Vice-Admiral Garp. He and Helmeppo are currently serving under the Vice-Admiral Garp, at Marine HQ. Koby reappears with Garp and Helmeppo in Chapter 431 at Water 7, looking significantly stronger and more mature.  It appears that Koby has also learned [[Cipher Pol#Soru|Soru]], similar to that of CP9 members, and with it was able to kick Luffy. Soon after, Luffy slammed him to the ground and only after that he admitted defeat.

His dream is to become an officer so he can catch criminals such as Alvida. In addition, he also wants to become strong and earn the rank of Admiral, and fight one-on-one with the person he sees will become Pirate King <U+2014> [[Monkey D. Luffy]].

It has not been explained by Oda how he changed so drastically in the facial part (nose, hair, forehead scar, etc).

{{nihongo|'''Chief Petty Officer Helmeppo'''|<U+30D8><U+30EB><U+30E1><U+30C3><U+30DD><U+8ECD><U+66F9>|Herumeppo Guns<U+014D>}} is Axe-Hand Morgan's bratty son. After Morgan is defeated, he does petty work for the Naval Base in Shell Town along with Koby. This changes when they meet Vice-Admiral Garp, who takes them to his own base on the Grand Line to watch over and help guide their progress.  His dream is to become an officer so he can regain the life of luxury he had before he was defeated by Luffy. He also wants to surpass his father, and capture him, as well as be able to fight one-on-one with Zoro.

Helmeppo reappeared in chapter 431 at Water 7, along with Koby and Garp, looking significantly stronger and more mature, both physically and mentally. He has grown his hair out, replacing his old onion-shaped haircut and seems to be skilled with [[kukri]] swords. Interestingly, this gives him a similar appearance to Sarquiss of the Bellamy Pirates, with the exception that the latter wields one large kukri. Helmeppo attempted to fight Zoro in chapter 432, but he was defeated. He was also upset when Luffy and Zoro did not recognize him, because he wanted them to forgive him from the Morgan fiasco. This appears to be a running gag, as Luffy never seems to notice Helmeppo whenever he's with Koby.

* It is possible that Helmeppo's surname is Morgan, as Rika refers to Helmeppo and his father as "the Morgans" in chapter 3 of the manga.

===Seaman Recruit===

[[Image:JangoMarine.JPG|thumb|Jango as a Recruit]]

'''Seaman Recruit Jango''' (<U+30B8><U+30E3><U+30F3><U+30B4><U+4E09><U+7B49><U+5175> ''Jango Santohei'', romanized in English adaptations as ''Django'', possibly to avoid comparison to [[Jango Fett]]) is the first mate and hypnotist of [[Captain Kuro]]. He uses disks that double as [[chakram]]s to [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] people to his advantage in battle.

Jango wears strange clothes, including a long coat covered in the disks he uses to fight and hypnotize, and red-lensed heart-shaped glasses. (Later, his eyes were revealed to actually be heart-shaped) It can be assumed that his character was based on [[Michael Jackson]], as when he travels he usually moonwalks, and he uses flashy gestures similar to his dance moves. Other notable similarities include his trench coat and his heart-shaped sunglasses; not to mention the socks, gloves, and Jackson-like facial features (the thin nose, etc.). 

Jango possesses the power of hypnosis, which he uses to put people to sleep, to make [[Captain Kuro|Captain Kuro's]] crew far more powerful and fierce and to serve other purposes necessary to help fulfil his plans. He is not, however, perfect with his hypnosis - when he puts people to sleep, he usually falls asleep as well. And when he hypnotizes the crew to make them stronger, he also accidentally hypnotizes [[Monkey D. Luffy]] - with unpleasant results. In combat he can use his throwing disks to cut through trees effortlessly, though he acts cowardly most of the time.

Jango is ordered by [[Captain Kuro|Kuro]] to kill [[One Piece minor characters#Kaya|Kaya]], but before he can kill her, [[Usopp]] hits him with his exploding stars. Jango is thought dead, but secretly survives. Through many adventures and lots of hypnosis, he ends up a Navy recruit, working alongside the disgraced Ironfist [[Navy (One Piece)#Fullbody 2|Fullbody]], under the command of [[Navy (One Piece)#Hina|Hina]] (whom they both adore).

He and Fullbody don't wear the official uniform that naval marines of their rank should, something that Hina allows them to do (Fullbody is shown wearing the full uniform before joining Hina's crew.) Hina treats the two of them as if they were higher ranking officers, like allowing them wear their own clothes, and giving them command of their own two ships when they went up against the Straw-hats. It all stands to reason, given that both men are much more skilled than their rank would imply, both having been in command of a ship prior to meeting Hina. He and Fullbody are never far from each other, and appear to act as assassins; possibly why Hina treats them so well.  Despite not wearing the uniform, Jango has his special variation of the blue scarf; a blue tie.

According to the answer to some fan mail Eichir<U+014D> Oda received, Jango gained his powers after eating a mushroom that had grown on his chin while he was sleeping.  He only ate the cap and the trunk of the mushroom still resides on his chin (whether or not this is a joke from Oda or not is yet to be proven).  <ref name="Jango1"> [[One Piece terms#SBS|SBS questions:]] ''One Piece Manga'' - Vol.6 Chapter 45 and ''One Piece Manga'' - Vol.14 Chapter 124
, Fan question: What is that thing growing on Jango's chin? </ref> 

Jango also makes an appearance in the featurette of the 2nd One Piece Movie called 'Jango's Dance Carnival'.

[[Image:FullbodyRecruit.JPG|thumb|right|Fullbody as a Recruit.]]

'''Fullbody''' (<U+30D5><U+30EB><U+30DC><U+30C7><U+30A3> ''Furubodi'', reference to the wine quality, as according to Eichiro Oda in the SBS section.) is a Seaman Recruit (<U+4E09><U+7B49><U+5175> ''Sant<U+014D>hei''), serving under captain Hina along with his friend Jango. He was once a Lieutenant (<U+5927><U+5C09> ''Tai'i'') with the nickname "'''Ironfist Fullbody'''" (<U+9244><U+62F3><U+306E><U+30D5><U+30EB><U+30DC><U+30C7><U+30A3> ''Tekken no Furubodi''), and a suave ladies' man. [[Sanji]] ruins his date with a woman by humiliating the arrogant man, and completely thrashes him when he ruins Sanji's soup. Fullbody, his ego in tatters, flees the oceangoing restaurant Baratie once the pirate [[One Piece minor characters#Gin|Gin]] breaks out of his cell on Fullbody's ship.

The next time Fullbody is seen, he is competing in a dance contest on Mirrorball Island. After coming in 2nd place behind Jango (who is in disguise so as not to be caught by the authorities), the two become fast friends while remaining oblivious to the other's identity. This is not to last long though, as Fullbody's men find Jango's trademark clothes in an alleyway. As a pirate crew invades the island, Jango takes the opportunity to escape while Fullbody attempts to fight them off. He is thwarted when their leader takes a woman hostage, and Fullbody surrenders to keep her safe. Suddenly, Jango bursts back onto the scene to save his friend. Putting aside their allegiances, Jango and Fullbody wipe out the pirates.

Fullbody still has his duties, however, and arrests Jango. But, as Jango is tried in court, Fullbody returns the favor and offers an objection dance which gets the whole courtroom caught up in a huge emotional dance-fest. Unable to deny the power of the men's friendship, the court acquits Jango on the condition that Fullbody be demoted to the rank of Seaman Recruit. Afterwards, Jango is about to hypnotize Fullbody into forgetting their friendship ever occurred (so that neither of their careers would be jeopardized in the future), when they both spot the beautiful Captain Hina. Inspired, they both become members of her crew.

Fullbody later appears in Alabasta, sporting two iron plates, chin stubble, and the new nickname "'''Double-Ironfist Fullbody'''" (<U+4E21><U+9244><U+62F3><U+306E><U+30D5><U+30EB><U+30DC><U+30C7><U+30A3> ''Ry<U+014D>tekken no Furubodi''). Like his friend Jango, he is completely enamored of Hina and will do anything to please her. He and Jango attempt to prevent the [[Straw Hat Pirates]] from escaping Alabasta, but are soundly defeated.

Fullbody appears much later in the story, tracking down remaining members of Baroque Works with Jango and Hina on Ky<U+016B>ka Island. He and Jango assist Hina in capturing [[Miss Valentine]], and are hunting down [[Mr. 5]], [[Miss Goldenweek]], and [[Mr. 2 Bon Clay]] (disguised as [[Mr. 3]]).

He and Jango don't wear the official uniform that naval marines of their rank should, something that Hina allows them to do (Fullbody is shown wearing the uniform before joining Hina's crew, this is proof that it is indeed Hina who allows them to wear their own clothes).  Hina treats the two of them as if they were higher ranking officers, like allowing them wear their own clothes, and giving them command of their own two ships when they went up against the Straw-hats.  He and Jango are never far from each other and appear to act as assassins.

Since working with Jango, his personality turned from a high-society gentleman to a bruiser, though he still loves to dance with Jango.  He and Jango serve as comic relief characters.

[[Image:Mbellemere.png|thumb|right|Bellemere as a Marine during a flashback]]

'''Bellemere''' (<U+30D9><U+30EB><U+30E1><U+30FC><U+30EB> ''Berum<U+0113>ru''; ''belle-m<U+00E8>re'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[stepmother]]" while both words separated would mean "beautiful mother") was [[Nami (One Piece)|Nami]] and [[Nojiko]]'s adoptive mother, seen in a flashback during the [[Arlong arc]]. It is said that in her youth she was as rambunctious and mischievous as Nami was as a child. Bellemere raised the two girls after they found her near death after a fight between naval marines (of which Bellemere was one) and pirates that left their home island in ruins.  

It is unknown what post or rank she held in the Navy before adopting Nami and [[Nojiko]] and getting shot by [[Arlong]], however, due to her uniform and blue scarf, it can be easily deduced that she was a seaman recruit.

While Bellemere had very little income, she gave everything to her girls and survived by eating the [[mikan]] she grew. One day Bellemere scolded Nami when she got caught stealing (Nami stole a book because she knew they were poor). Nami wouldn't acknowledge the three of them as a real family, and ran off, saying that she wished she were adopted by rich people.

That same day [[Arlong]] invaded the island and found her home, Bellemere tried to fend them off but was quickly subdued. When asked for the fee needed to stay alive, it turned out all the money Bellemere had would either save herself or her two daughters. Things would've been okay, as [[Arlong]] was unaware of the two girls' existence, but Bellemere gave it to her two girls as she would rather have died than not call herself a mother. To that end, [[Arlong]] shot her right in front of the eyes of her two adopted daughters, but not before Bellemere apologized to Nami for not being richer, and not being able to buy the girls whatever they wanted. With that, she said her final words to the girls: "I love you." Bellemere is hardly ever seen without a cigarette. She has the word "Mace," on her shirt. Both the word and the cigarette are edited out in the [[4Kids]] dub.  Also in the 4Kids version of the anime, she is sent to the dungeon for not paying her fee and is killed off screen.

In a recent Japanese Fan Poll, Bellemere is currently ranked the 32nd most popular character in One Piece.
