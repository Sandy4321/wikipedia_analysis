'''Amador Valley High School''' is a public high school in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], [[California]], USA, a city east of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Amador Valley is one of four high schools in the Pleasanton Unified School District, which includes [[Foothill High School (Pleasanton, California)|Foothill High School]], [[Village High School]], and [[Horizon High School (Pleasanton, California)|Horizon High School]]. The school was founded as Amador Valley Joint Union High School, from which its first class graduated in 1923. The school has been named a [[California Distinguished School]], a [[Character Education Partnership|National School of Character]], and a [[National Blue Ribbon School]].

As of 2009, Amador Valley offers its 2,500&nbsp;students 23&nbsp;[[varsity team|varsity sports]], 20&nbsp;[[Advanced Placement]] courses, a program to study local aquatic wildlife, and vocational training. A monthly school publication, the ''Amadon'', reports on athletics, academic and extracurricular issues, and news of the school and community. Amador's location allows it to be the launching point for parades and to host the site of the Amador Theater, Pleasanton's central performing arts facility for more than 60 years. The Amador Theater has remained a part of the Amador Valley campus since the 1930s, despite major school construction in 1968, 1997, and 2004. 

Student groups, including the Marching Band and Math Team, have toured out-of-state after achieving high rankings in Californian competitions. In national competitions such as [[We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution]], the Amador Valley team has ranked in the top four places from 2006 to 2009. Similarly, the Amador Valley Robotics Team is recognized nationally as the only high school team in the [[autonomous underwater vehicle]] (AUV) competition hosted by [[Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI)|Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International]] (AUVSI).

==History==
===Region and districts===
Amador Valley High School, originally Amador Valley Joint Union High School,<ref name="pw 2007b"/> was named for its location in the Amador Valley (part of the [[Tri-Valley]] area of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Francisco East Bay]]). The valley's namesake was a wealthy [[California]] rancher, Don Jos<U+00E9> Mar<U+00ED>a Amador.<ref name="wainwright p77"/> The school was founded on March 14, 1922, as part of the Amador Valley Joint Union High School District (AVJUHSD), out of concerns of overcrowding and transportation for students travelling to other schools;<ref name="long pp30-31"/> its first class graduated in 1923. For four decades, Amador Valley was the only high school in the Amador-Livermore Valley Region.<ref name="wainwright p124"/>

From 1922 to 1988, the school was part of the AVJUHSD.<ref name="pw 2007b"/><ref name="pw 2007a"/> Originally this district also taught students from nearby [[Dublin, California|Dublin]] and served the local rural community.<ref name="wainwright pp15, 92"/> In the late 1930s, the Amador Theater was built as part of the Amador Valley High School campus. The theater hosted school plays, band concerts, performances, lectures, and assemblies, and was the former home of the successful community theatre group Cask and Mask, now known as The Masquers.<ref name="pleasantonci">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.pleasanton.ca.us/community/arts/at-about.html |title=City of Pleasanton - About Amador Theater |publisher=Ci.pleasanton.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref> The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]] led to the building of a series of freeways in the region, which in turn coincided with increaded population and an increase in student enrollment.<ref name="pw 2007c"/><ref name="wainwright p109"/>  

In 1988, voters approved the unification of several school districts in the region. On July 1, 1988, the AVJUHSD merged with the Pleasanton Joint School District to form the Pleasanton Unified School District.<ref name="long p2"/><ref name="pw 2005b"/> As of 2009, the district contains two comprehensive high schools (Amador Valley and Foothill), two [[continuation high school]]s (Horizon and Village), three middle schools, seven elementary schools, and an adult education program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ppie.org/about.html |title=PPIE - Pleasanton Partnerships in Education Foundation |publisher=Pleasanton Partnerships in Education Foundation |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>

The school grounds are bordered on the east and southeast by Santa Rita Road, the [[Altamont Commuter Express]] rail line, and [[Arroyo del Valle]].<ref name="wainwright p92"/> To the north are several businesses and residential districts lie on the western border. Because of the school's proximity to Main Street and downtown, Amador Valley High School is the launch point for the annual Pleasanton Hometown Holidays Celebration Parade and the annual Fall Festival Parade, a part of the [[Alameda County Fairgrounds|Alameda County Fair]] since the 1940s. The Fall Festival parade, which features bands, floats, balloons, horses, and antique cars, starts on the Amador Valley parking lot, travels down Main Street, and ends near the fairgrounds.<ref name="vt 2007"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Parade Participant Dropoff Instructions |url=http://www.ci.pleasanton.ca.us/pdf/hhc-dropoff.pdf |publisher=The City of Pleasanton |accessdate=2009-06-30|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Court battle===
In 1978, the AVJUHSD challenged the constitutionality of [[California Proposition 13 (1978)|California Proposition&nbsp;13]], which placed a cap on county real estate taxes. The proposition limited property tax assessments to the 1975 standard, eliminating $7 billion of the $11.4 billion in property tax revenue collected each year. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the "severe" limitations this imposed on state funding forced local governments and most school districts in California to make "drastic cutbacks".<ref name="budget cutbacks"/> The district held that the measure was "so drastic and far-reaching that it was 'a revision' of the state Constitution and not a mere amendment". Ultimately, the district was unsuccessful in its suit. In their ruling, the judges distinguished between "[[Constitutional amendment|amendment]]" and "[[Constitutional revision|revision]]." The court confirmed that an initiative cannot "revise" the constitution; Proposition&nbsp;13, however, was an amendment to the [[California Constitution]] and not a "revision".<ref name="court ruling"/> In 2009, ''Amador Valley'' was cited by dissenting Justice [[Carlos R. Moreno]] in arguing the non-constitutionality of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|California Proposition&nbsp;8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwlc.org/files/docs/S168047_Prop8-Opinion_5-26-09.pdf|title=In the Supreme Court of California|date=2009-05-26|publisher=California Women's Law Center|page=152|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>

===Development===

[[File:Amador Valley and Pleasanton Ridge.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Beige building with red roof. Grassy field in front and tree-covered hill in the back. A group of students sits on a bench facing the building.|School campus with the Pleasanton Ridge in the background]]

The first class of eight students graduated in 1923, and the school quickly became known for its municipal bands and sports teams.<ref name="wainwright p93"/> The school selected the [[Don (honorific)|Don]] as its mascot, in honor of the title used by Amador;<ref name="wainwright p77"/> ''Don'' is a Spanish term used as a mark of high esteem for a distinguished nobleman or gentleman.

Parents of Amador Valley students became involved with student activities. In 1927, Pleasanton mothers decided to start a school lunch program to provide students with a better environment for learning. Parents donated pots and pans, and a newly hired cook prepared lunches, to be eaten at new tables and benches. The tables and benches were constructed by the custodian and the music teacher from wood of horse stalls formerly on the campus. This project led to the formation of a [[Parent-Teacher Association]] (PTA) chapter at Amador Valley in the late 1920s.<ref name="long p66"/>

Much of the original Amador Valley High School building was reconstructed in 1968. The following year, the school reached its maximum capacity, about 1,895&nbsp;students.  To accommodate the larger student population, [[Dublin High School (Dublin, California)|Dublin High School]] was founded. Both schools held classes on the Amador Valley campus during the 1968&ndash;69 school year.<ref name="long p96"/>  A continued influx of families to the Pleasanton region prompted the foundation of another high school, [[Foothill High School (Pleasanton, California)|Foothill]], in 1973.<ref name="wainwright p124"/>

On the right, a smaller beige building and a large tree|The library and media center is the tallest building on the Amador Valley campus.<ref name="pw 2002a"/> According to former Amador Valley librarian Ellen Bell, the building was designed to be "open, spacious and exciting."<ref name="pw 2002a"/>]]

From November 3 to November 5 in 1986, Amador Valley teachers went on a three-day strike to "protest a breakdown in negotiations for a new contract."<ref name="strike" /> The school brought in [[substitute teacher|substitutes]] to replace the picketing teachers.<ref name="strike">{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB72997392F69CD&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Pleasanton Teachers Begin 3-day Walkout |work=Mercury News |publisher=San Jose Mercury News |date=1986-11-03 |accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> Amador Valley teachers are [[Trade Union|unionized]] under the [[California Teachers Association]] and the [[National Education Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perb.ca.gov/decisionbank/pdfs/0024E.pdf |title=Pleasanton Joint Elementary School District and Amador Valley Teachers Association, CTA/NEA |publisher=State of California Decision of the Educational Employment Relations Board |date=1977-09-12 |accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>

In March 1997, the city passed Measure B, which granted the school district $69 million dollars to replace old and crowded facilities and modernize the school campus.<ref name="pw 2002a"/> The renovations revived one of the school's last original structures: the Amador Theater, the city's most popular performing arts facility.<ref name="pleasantonci" /><ref name="wainwright p124"/> The measure enabled the addition of renovated science classrooms, a multipurpose room, a library and media center, and a sound-proofed music building. The parking lot and central quad were expanded, and classrooms were equipped to be more energy efficient.<ref name="2005 sarc"/>

In 1999, responding to a directive from the [[Superintendent (education)|California Superintendent of Education]], the district identified character education as one of its goals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/AMADOR/taw/TAW.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050208184759/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/AMADOR/taw/TAW.htm |archivedate=2005-02-08 |title=Character Education Plan |publisher=Pleasanton Unified School District |date=2003-06-18 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}</ref> As selected by the community, six character traits (responsibility, compassion, self-discipline, honesty, respect, and integrity) were listed as "expected behaviors" for Pleasanton. In 2004, Amador Valley and the school district won national recognition ([[Character Education Partnership|National School of Character]]) for its program emphasizing the Community of Character.<ref name="pw 2005b"/>

In 2004, a new two-story building was completed, containing twenty-four new classrooms. The following year, the Charles <U+201C>Chuck<U+201D> Volonte Aquatic Center was built for Amador Valley's swimming, diving, and water polo teams. Lighting retrofits were added in December 2004 for improved energy efficiency and illumination.<ref name="2005 sarc"/> In 2005, Amador Valley High School was the first high school to join the worldwide [[Go Green Initiative]]. In the same year, Pleasanton was selected as the "Go Green City of the Year."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gogreeninitiative.org/content/About/History.html |title=Helping the World Go Green |publisher=Go Green Initiative |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>

"The goal is to let kids realize there are a number of different physical and biological components that allow these organisms (in the creek) to coexist," said Eric Thiel, an Amador Valley Biology teacher and a co-founder of the project. "I hope they walk away able to see how complex ecosystems are."<ref name="pw 2000"/> In 1999, the project received a Golden Bell Award for excellence in education from the California School Boards Association. Research projects about the creek and other topics have won first place awards at the Tri-Valley Science and Engineering Fair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://education.llnl.gov/sos/2001/lecture5/bios.html |title=STEP Science on Saturday: Lecture Five |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National lab |date= |accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref><ref name="ot 2009a"/><ref name="intel">{{cite web|first=Bob |last=Hirschfeld |url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2008/NR-08-06-01.html |title=Lab-sponsored science fair winners take home awards at international and state competitions |publisher=Publicaffairs.llnl.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref> In 2001, Thiel and the school received a [[National Semiconductor]] "Internet Innovator Award" for the Project Creek Watch website.<ref name="pw 2001b"/>

The Amador Valley Robotics Team, founded in 1999, is the first and only high school team to compete in the [[Autonomous underwater vehicle|Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)]] Competition hosted by the [[Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI)]].<ref name="sdut 2005"/><ref name="pw 2001a"/><ref name="sfc 2000"/> Each year, with a minimal amount of outside technical assistance, the team develops an AUV to maneuver an underwater obstacle course.<ref name="pw 2001a"/>

The team first entered the competition in 2000 with its ''Hammerhead'' AUV, weighing 98&nbsp;kg (220&nbsp;pounds).<ref name="2000 robotics paper"/> They placed seventh in the field of twelve.<ref name="sfc 2000"/> According to Daryl Davidson, the executive director of AUVSI, "The Amador group really broke the ice by being the first high school team at the competition... It caught everybody off-guard and their enthusiasm was very infectious."<ref name="pw 2001a"/>

At the 2001 competition, Amador Valley placed second to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] with its ''Manta Ray'' AUV.<ref name="pw 2008a"/><ref name="2001 robotics paper"/> The ''Manta Ray'' weighed less than 100&nbsp;kg (220&nbsp;pounds) and featured a modular design.<ref name="2001 robotics paper"/> According to Jim Bales, technical director of the competition, the technical details of the ''Manta Ray'' impressed many judges and its performance surpassed a number of university teams.<ref name="pw 2001a"/>

The Amador Valley ''Barracuda'' line, started in 2002, "is propelled by two laterally mounted SeaBotix thrusters controlling speed and heading and two auxiliary thrusters aligned vertically controlling pitch and depth." To guide the AUV autonomously, a [[pressure sensor]], compass, camera, and [[hydrophone|hydrophone array]] return navigation input data to the software. The AUV uses an [[OQO]] Model&nbsp;+01 that runs [[Windows XP]].<ref name="2002 robotics paper"/><ref name="2008 robotics paper"/>

In 2008, several fundamental changes were made to the robot. The [[control system]] was reorganized and the mission control software was revamped to improve communication and to limit overhead. A low-level [[microcontroller]]-based control system was added to free up system resources. This extra processing capability will be used for mission control and [[image processing]] tasks.<ref name="2008 robotics paper"/>

Amador Valley's [[UNICEF]] Club was founded to partner with the organization's [[Tap Project]], which raises money "to improve access to safe
water and sanitation facilities in schools and communities, as well as promote safe hygiene."<ref name="pw 2009c"/> Club members raised money for the project by asking local restaurants to ask their patrons to consider donating one dollar for a glass of tap water that would otherwise be free. The club's idea originated after four members of the school traveled to [[Japan]] to represent the [[United States]] at the Junior 8 Summit. Amador Valley's [[UNICEF]] Club has been praised for its efforts to "educate, advocate and fundraise for UNICEF programs."<ref name="pw 2009c"/>

The Human Rights Club is a similar sort of outreach group, affiliated with [[Amnesty International]] and [[STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition|STAND]].
