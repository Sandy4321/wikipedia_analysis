The '''Shanghai Cultural Plaza''' precinct ({{zh-tsp|s=<U+6587><U+5316><U+5E7F><U+573A>|t=<U+6587><U+5316><U+5EE3><U+5834>|p=W<U+00E9>nhu<U+00E0> Gu<U+0103>ngch<U+0103>ng}}) is an area in Shanghai's [[Luwan District]], in the former French Concession of [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. The area began as the '''Canidrome''' ({{zh-tsp|s=<U+9038><U+56ED><U+8DD1><U+72D7><U+573A>|t=<U+9038><U+5712><U+8DD1><U+72D7><U+5834>|p=Y<U+00ED>yu<U+00E1>n P<U+0103>og<U+014F>uch<U+0103>ng}}), a stadium structure originally built for [[greyhound racing]] in [[1928]]<ref>Brown, James Dale.  [2002] (2002).  Frommer's Shanghai.  Frommer's Publishing.  ISBN 0764566997</ref>. The clubhouse and racetrack became a multi-purpose entertainment venue, but became a place for political rallies after the founding of the [[People's Republic of China]] and a mass execution facility.  Later it became a theatre and exhibition space before it was demolished in [[2006]].  The original Canidrome grandstand was demolished as part of the reconstruction of the precinct to become a park incorporating various cultural venues<ref name="BBB">Beyer Blinder Belle China.

==Name==
[[Image:CanidromePerform.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Inside of the Canidrome 1930s with [[Buck Clayton]] performing]]
The English name "Canidrome" is a composition of ''[[Canis|cani-]]'', dog, and ''drome'', race course. The Chinese name, ''Yiyuan Paigouchang'', means "Yi Garden dog racing track", where "''Yi''" literally means leisure. The Canidrome has also been labeled the Rendezvous for Shanghai's Elite.

After [[1949]], greyhound racing, like other forms of gambling, was banned by the Communist party, and the precinct's name was changed to the Shanghai Cultural Plaza.

==History==
===Pre-1949===
The stadium was built in [[1928]]. It could seat 50,000 spectators.  It was the largest of the three stadiums built at the time to house animal racing<ref name="Jackson">Jackson, Beverley.  [2005] (2005).  Shanghai Girl Gets All dressed up.  Ten Speed Press.  ISBN 1580083676</ref>.

In the 1920s and 30s, the canidrome was mostly a facility limited to Westerners and Europeans. The Canidrome ballroom was where the [[United States|American]] [[Buck Clayton]] and his band performed<ref name="Jones">Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music - CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. ISBN 0822326949</ref>.  The Chinese discrimination mostly came about from the effects of the [[Treaty of the Bogue]].

The Canidrome also served as a sporting venue. On March 15, 1941 a soccer game between the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Chinese team turned into a riot in the Canidrome, and cause 20,000 Chinese spectators to flood the field.  As many as 30 people were injured in the game riot<ref name="Wakeman">Wakeman, Frederic E.  [1996] (1996).  The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941.

===1949-1976===
====Mass execution facility====
The [[People's Liberation Army]] marched into Shanghai in May 1949<ref name=Bellucci>Bellucci, Lucille.  [2005] (2005).  Journey from Shanghai.  iUniverse Publishing.  ISBN 0595343732</ref>.  Public trial meetings held in the Canidrome was referred to as "The Shanghai Enlarged Joint Meeting of People's Representatives' Conference"<ref>Karanjia, Rustom Khurshedji.  [1952] (1952).  China Stands up and wolves of the wild west.  People's Publishing House.  No ISBN digitized</ref>.  The Canidrome and the separate Shanghai Race Course were places where mass executions took place in the hands of the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], killing hundreds each day<ref name=Bellucci />.  
The city police, helped by Communist political police, in a single night arrested an estimated 24,000 Chinese, and dragged them off to concentration camps in Shanghai's outskirts. Among the arrested were former [[Kuomintang]] officials, school-teachers, [[Christian]] churchmen, non-Communist union leaders, property owners, newspaper workers, factory managers, and students<ref name="Time">"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859181,00.html "''Kill nice!''"] Time magazine, May 21, 1951, Retrieved on [[2007-05-08]].</ref>. The executions were selected by a committee of 24 Communist-appointed "civic leaders".  The [[Xinhua News Agency]] reported that Shanghai high-school students marched beside the prisoners on their way to execution beating gongs and drums, and chanting: "Kill nice! Kill them well! Kill all of them!". At the time 10,000 people gathered and demanded the death of the accused in a unanimous roar<ref name="Time" />.

====Reconstruction====
After banning greyhound racing and other forms of gambling, the Communist government re-constructed the Canidrome. Additional buildings gradually turned the entire race-course into an indoor venue. The existing grandstand, including its auditorium, was retained. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], the Cultural Plaza became a venue for public meetings, where [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guards]] and other agitators denounced "class enemies" and figures of authority.

===1976-1980s===
For the 20 years after the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Cultural Plaza served a number of purposes. Its auditorium was used as performance space for films and theatre. It was also used as a conference venue, often housing political conferences and meetings. Beginning from the [[1980s]], the Shanghai Municipal Government began discussing the redevelopment of the Cultural Plaza precinct. Decades of neglect had left the buildings in the precinct in need of repair. Construction in the precinct since [[1949]] had lacked overall planning. Its former role as a space for political meetings had diminished in significance, while its role as a performance space had been superseded by newer or better facilities.

===1990s-2000s===
====Redevelopment====
The large, covered space built over the former Canidrome also served as a versatile exhibition space. In [[1997]], this area became the location of the Shanghai Flower Market.

In [[2003]], a series of international design competitions were held<ref name="BBB"/>. A plan was adopted to rebuild the precinct as a park. Certain elements of the original structures will be retained, including the long-span space frame structure over the auditorium, which was, at the time of its construction, the longest such span in the [[Far East]]<ref name="BBB"/>.

The original grandstand, along with most of the other structures in the precinct, was demolished in [[2005]].<ref>Sina News. "[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/p/2005-12-01/06118454097.shtml Landmark of yesteryear, Shanghai Cultural Plaza demolished]". [[2005-12-01]]. Retried [[2007-05-19]].</ref>
