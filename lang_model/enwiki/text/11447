'''Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester''' is a [[light rail]] route operated by [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA).   The Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester route is one of three existing VTA light rail routes.  The other two light rail routes are the [[Alum Rock<U+2013>Santa Teresa (VTA)|Alum Rock<U+2013>Santa Teresa]] line and [[Ohlone/Chynoweth<U+2013>Almaden (VTA)|Ohlone/Chynoweth<U+2013>Almaden]] line.  On system maps, the line is represented as the '''Green Line,''' however, unlike many other transit systems, VTA personnel do not refer to the line by its color, much less refer to it as '''Line 902''' on official documents.

==Route description==
The Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester line starts from the [[Downtown Mountain View station]] ([[Mountain View, California]]), travels toward the east, passing under [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] at Ellis Avenue, following Mathilda Avenue to Java Drive, crossing [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] and turning east on Tasman Drive.  At First Street,  it turns south and shares tracks of the [[Alum Rock<U+2013>Santa Teresa (VTA)|Alum Rock<U+2013>Santa Teresa]] line to [[downtown]] San Jose.  After the [[Convention Center (VTA)|Convention Center]] stop, it leaves the shared portion of the tracks and heads south west to the [[Winchester Transit Center|Winchester]] station in southern [[Campbell, California|Campbell]], with a stop at [[Caltrain]] and [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Diridon Station]].  The whole route takes approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.

==Owl service==
From February 2000 to April 14, 2003, VTA operated all night train service with light rail vehicles (commonly known as "owl service") on a 70 minute frequency between [[Downtown Mountain View station|Mountain View]] and [[Baypointe (VTA)|Baypointe]]. VTA light rail was the only light rail service in the United States to operate 24 hours a day. The owl service was curtailed in 2003 as a result of mounting deficits.

==Construction history==
The route that the Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester line now runs on is constructed in three different expansion projects: the original '''Guadelup<U+00E9> line''', the '''Tasman West extension''', and the '''Vasona extension'''.

===Guadelup<U+00E9> line===
The trackway between Woz Way in Downtown San Jose and [[Old Ironsides (VTA)|Old Ironsides]] station is part of Guadelup<U+00E9> line, the first light rail line constructed in Santa Clara county.  Guadalup<U+00E9> line opened for revenue service on December 10, 1987 originally running from Old Ironsides station to [[Civic Center (VTA)|Civic Center]] station in San Jose.  [[Champion (VTA)|Champion]] station was not part of the original line; it was added as intermediate stop as part of the Tasman West project.

<ref>Grant, Joanne. "Mishap Won't Delay Light Rail." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. 6 November 1987. Sec B:3.</ref>

Service on this line was gradually expanded south from Civic Center station as follows:
*Service through the downtown mall and onward to the [[Convention Center (VTA)|Convention Center]] station began on July 17, 1988.<ref>Sweeney, Frank. "Downtown S.J. Trollys Start Friday." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. 13 July 1988. Sec B:1.</ref>
*Service between Convention Center and [[Tamien station|Tamien]] stations began on August 17, 1990.<ref>_______.  "Light Rail to Willow Glen Opening Friday." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. 16 August 1990. Sec B:3.</ref>
*Service between Tamien and [[Santa Teresa (VTA)|Santa Teresa]] stations began on April 25, 1991.<ref>Guido, Michelle. "The Trolly Finally Makes its Way South in Debut Today." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''.  25 April 1991. Sec A:1.</ref>

===Tasman West extension===
The Tasman West extension project added to the line as follows:
*[[Champion (VTA)|Champion]] station added as an intermediate stop along existing Guadelupe line trackway (Station opened March 24, 1997).<ref>Barnacle, Betty. "Light Rail Opens New Stop; First Station on Tasman Line to Serve North S.J. High-Tech Firms." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. 24 March 1997. Sec B:1.</ref>
*7.6 miles (12.2&nbsp;km) of trackway and 12 new light rail stations added between the existing [[Old Ironsides (VTA)|Old Ironsides station]] and the new [[Downtown Mountain View station]]. (Opened December 17, 1999.)
*[[Baypointe (VTA)|Baypointe]] station added just east of the intersection of 1st and Tasman.  (Opened December 17, 1999.)  
:''Baypointe station is no longer served by this line due to a line reconfiguration implemented in August 2005.''
*After the completion of Tasman West extension and before the completion of Tasman East/Capitol and Vasona extensions, VTA split the light rail system into two main lines: one line running between Baypointe and Downtown Mountain View, the other between Baypointe and [[Santa Teresa (VTA)|Santa Teresa]].  Passengers transferred between the two lines at the new Baypointe station.<ref>Diaz, Sam. "Ready for a Rail Good Time: Major Link for Transit Takes its First Step." ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''. 18 December 1999. Sec B:1.</ref> [[Tasman (VTA)|Tasman]] is now the transfer station.

Tasman West extension was constructed with funds from 1996 Measure B sales tax measure.

===Vasona extension===
Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester contains the entire Vasona extension from [[San Fernando (VTA)|San Fernando station]] to the southern line terminal, [[Winchester (VTA)|Winchester station]]. Vasona extension opened for revenue service on October 1, 2005. It was originally scheduled to open two months earlier on August 1 but delayed due to a dispute between [[Federal Railroad Administration]] and VTA.  At issue was whether a waiver was needed from FRA, since the [[Union Pacific]] branchline that parallels most of Vasona extension is still actively used on a tri-weekly basis.  A waiver was finally obtained on the condition that all light rail vehicles sound their horns at crossings until "Quiet Zone" improvements are implemented (freight trains are still required to sound their horns). Vasona extension was also constructed with funds from 1996 Measure B sales tax measure.

===Possible future expansion===
A '''Vasona extension Phase 2''' was designed but not constructed because a funding source can not be identified. Phase 2 would extend the light rail line westwards to Vasona Junction in eastern Los Gatos. It is expected that Mountain View<U+2013>Winchester would extend to terminate at Vasona Junction if Phase 2 is built.

===Supplementary service===
During peak periods and late nights, many trains operate as [[short turn]] trips, meaning they operate portions of the route. Late night supplementary services are also provided northbound from [[Baypointe (VTA)|Baypointe]] to Downtown Mountain View.
