The '''red ruffed lemur''' (''Varecia rubra'') is one of two species in the genus ''Varecia'', the [[ruffed lemur]]s; the other is the [[black-and-white ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia variegata''). Like all [[lemur]]s, it is native to [[Madagascar]] and occurs only in the [[rainforest]]s of [[Masoala National Park|Masoala]], in the northeast of the island.<ref name=iucn/>  It is one of the largest primates of Madagascar with a body length of 53&nbsp;cm, a tail length of 60&nbsp;cm and a weight of 3.3<U+2013>3.6&nbsp;kg. Its soft, thick fur is red and black in colour and sports a buff or cream colored spot at the nape, but a few are known to have a white or pink patch on the back of the limbs or digits and a ring on the base of the tail in a similar color.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vasey|year=1997}}</ref>

There is also another species of ruffed lemur that is similar to the red ruffed lemur; the black-and-white ruffed lemur. They both live in the rainforest along the east coast of Madagascar, but they do not associate with each other.

==Physical characteristics==
Ruffed lemurs are the largest members of the family Lemuridae,<ref>http://www.zoo.org/page.aspx?pid=1896</ref> with this species being the larger of the two. It weighs {{convert|3.3|-|3.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=LoM3>{{LoM3|pages=303<U+2013>323}}</ref> It is about {{convert|53|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} tail.<ref name="duke">{{cite web | url = http://lemur.duke.edu/category/diurnal-lemurs/red-ruffed-lemur/ | title = Duke Primate Center red ruffed lemur | accessdate = 2006-04-05}}</ref> Females are slightly larger than males.<ref name="zooFactsheet">{{cite web | url = http://www.zoo.org/factsheets/red_lemur/redRuffedLemur.html | title = red ruffed lemur factsheet | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}{{Dead link|date=December 2011}}</ref> They have slender bodies and long legs. Red ruffed lemurs have a narrow snout with small back ears that are sometimes hidden by their long fur. They groom themselves using their toothcomb.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

As its name would suggest, it has a rust-coloured ruff and body. Its head, stomach, tail, feet, and the insides of its legs are black. It has a white patch on the back of its neck, and may also have white markings on its feet or mouth.<ref name="zooFactsheet"/>

==Behavior==
The red ruffed lemur is a very clean animal and spends a lot of time grooming itself and [[Social grooming|each other]]. The lower incisors (front teeth) and the claw on the second toe of the hind foot are specially adapted for this behavior. The lower incisors grow forward in line with each other and are slightly spaced. This creates a [[toothcomb]] which can be used to groom its long, soft fur. The claw is also used for grooming.

The red ruffed lemur lives 15<U+2013>20 years in the wild. In captivity, 25 years is not uncommon, and one lived to be about 33 years old. It is a [[diurnal animal]], and most active in the morning and evening.<ref name="animalInfo">{{cite web | url = http://www.animalinfo.org/species/primate/varevari.htm | title = Animal Info - Ruffed Lemur | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}</ref>

===Social systems===
[[File:Red Ruffed Lemurs drinking.JPG|thumb|A pair of red ruffed lemurs drinking]]
This [[prosimian]] typically lives in small, [[matriarchal]] groups of 2-16 individuals, but group sizes of up to 32 have been recorded. Its diet consists primarily of fruit, nectar, and pollen. Leaves and seeds may be eaten when fruit becomes scarce.<ref name="duke"/> Red ruffed lemurs will sometimes form large groups during the wet season when food is plentiful. .They will all find one food source and forage together as a group. During the dry season they will often separate and find food on their own when the fruit is hard to find. This is very odd because most other diurnal lemurs will stay together and forage in large groups even during the dry season. <ref name="duke"/> Field studies suggest that red ruffed lemurs, like black-and-white ruffed lemurs, may be found in monogamous pairs or in small, organized groups. Individuals out in forest communicate through loud booming calls, which can be heard for miles. <ref>http://www.cougarmountainzoo.org/The%20Animals/redruffedlemurfact.aspx</ref>

===Breeding and reproduction===
Red ruffed lemurs reach sexual maturity at about 2 years of age, and start reproducing at about 3 years of age.<ref>http://www.zoo.org/page.aspx?pid=1896</ref> Unlike all other diurnal [[primates]],<ref name="duke"/> females build nests 10<U+2013>20 meters above the forest floor, made with twigs, leaves, vines, and fur. Like all [[lemurs]], and many Madagascan [[mammals]], it has a fixed breeding season which takes place towards the end of the dry season (May to July). This is so the young can be born in the wet season when more food is available. Ruffed lemurs are also the only primates with litters of young, and, after a [[gestation]] period of 102 days, the female may give birth to up to six, although two or three is more typical. Newborns have fur and can see, but as they cannot move, the female leaves them in the nest until they are seven weeks old. Females can nurse up to six infants at the same time. Infant red ruffed lemurs are not as well developed at birth as other lemurs. This is not surprising because red ruffed lemurs have extremely short gestation periods. At birth, infants are not able to hold onto the mother. When she moves the infants she picks them up one by one. Mothers usually move their infants away from the nest after a week or two. When she forages leaves her infants in a nearby tree. In the few days after she gives birth, if the mother needs to leave the nest, the father will stand guard.<ref>http://lemur.duke.edu/red-ruffed-lemur-reproduction/</ref> [[Weaning]] occurs at four months.<ref name="zooFactsheet"/> It is estimated that 65% of young do not reach three months of age, and often die by falling from the trees.<ref name="duke"/>

===Diet===
The red ruffed lemur is mainly a [[Frugivore|fruit-eater]], though it is known to eat leaves and shoots. They especially like figs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/learning/animals/mammals/red-lemur |title= Bristol Zoo gardens: red ruffed lemur| accessdate=June 24, 2009}}</ref>

===Communication===
The [[Duke Lemur Center]] has recorded about twelve different calls. The red ruffed lemur and Black-and-White Ruffed Lemur understand each other's calls, despite living in different parts of Madagascar. [[Scent marking]] is also an important means of communication.<ref name='duke'/>

==Conservation status==
The IUCN Red List states that the red ruffed lemur is endangered. Logging, burning of habitat, mining, hunting, and the illegal pet trade are primary threats. They also have natural predators such as boa constrictors, eagles, and the fossa. <ref>http://www.theanimalfiles.com/mammals/primates/lemur_red_ruffed.html</ref><ref name=iucn/> The creation of the [[Masoala National Park]] in 1997 has helped protect this species, but many red ruffed lemurs do not live within the park's boundaries, and are still at high risk.<ref name="duke"/>

The exact status of the red ruffed lemur in the wild is not fully known, but recent studies show that they are endangered with a declining wild population. The captive population of red ruffed lemurs stands at 591 animals. The population of red ruffed lemurs is directed by a Species Survival Plan.<ref>http://lemur.duke.edu/red-ruffed-lemur-habitat-conservation/</ref> Several of these zoos work with each other in [[breeding program|breeding]] and caring for the captive population. To prevent inbreeding, wild caught animals have been introduced to the captive breeding program.
