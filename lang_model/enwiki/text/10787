In the [[World War II]] naval '''Battle of the North Cape''', ships of the British [[Royal Navy]] sank the German light [[battleship]] [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] off [[Norway]]'s [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]] on [[December 26]] [[1943]]. It may be the northernmost naval battle in history.

==Background==
[[Operation Ostfront|Operation ''Ostfront'']] was an attempt by the Kriegsmarine to intercept the [[Soviet Union|Russia]]-bound [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoy]] JW 55B. The convoy, sighted three days before by a [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft, consisted of nineteen cargo vessels, escorted by the destroyers [[HMS Onslow (G17)|HMS ''Onslow'']], [[HMS Onslaught (G04)|HMS ''Onslaught'']], [[HMS Orwell (G98)|HMS ''Orwell'']], [[HMS Scourage|HMS ''Scourage'']], [[HMS Impulse|HMS ''Impulse'']], [[HMCS Haida (G63)|HMCS ''Haida'']], [[HMCS Huron (G24),|HMCS ''Huron'']], and [[HMCS Iroquois (G89)|HMCS ''Iroquois'']], and the minesweeper [[HMS Gleaner|HMS ''Gleaner'']].

On [[25 December]] 1943, the German [[battleship]] ''Scharnhorst'' (Captain [[Fritz Hintze]]) with the [[Narvik class destroyer|''Narvik'' class]] [[destroyers]] [[German Destroyer Z-29|''Z 29'']], [[German Destroyer Z-30|''Z 30'']], [[German Destroyer Z-33|''Z 33'']], [[German Destroyer Z-34|''Z 34'']], and [[German Destroyer Z-38|''Z 38'']] left Norway's [[Alta, Norway|Alta Fjord]] under the overall command of [[Konteradmiral]] (Rear Admiral) [[Erich Bey]].

Also in the area was convoy RA 55A, returning to the [[United Kingdom]] from Russia. RA 55A consisted of 22 cargo ships, escorted by the destroyers [[HMS Musketeer|HMS ''Musketeer'']], [[HMS Opportune|HMS ''Opportune'']], [[HMS Virago|HMS ''Virago'']], [[HMS Matchless|HMS ''Matchless'']], [[HMS Milne|HMS ''Milne'']], [[HMS Meteor|HMS ''Meteor'']], [[HMS Ashanti (F51)|HMS ''Ashanti'']], [[HMCS Athabaskan (G07)|HMCS ''Athabascan'']], and the minesweeper [[HMS Seagull|HMS ''Seagull'']].

Unknown to the Germans was the presence in the area of major [[Royal Navy]] forces. Force 1, under [[Rear Admiral]] [[Robert Burnett]], comprising the [[cruiser]]s [[HMS Norfolk (78)|HMS ''Norfolk'']], [[HMS Belfast (C35)|HMS ''Belfast'']], and [[HMS Sheffield (C24)|HMS ''Sheffield'']], was nearby. Force 2 commanded by [[Admiral]] [[Bruce Fraser|Sir Bruce Fraser]], consisting of the modern [[battleship]] [[HMS Duke of York (17)|''Duke of York'']], the cruiser [[HMS Jamaica (C44)|HMS ''Jamaica'']], and the [[S and T class destroyer|S-class destroyers]] [[HMS Savage|HMS ''Savage'']], [[HMS Scorpion|HMS ''Scorpion'']], [[HMS Saumarez (G12)|HMS ''Saumarez'']], [[HMS Sword|HMS ''Sword'']] and [[HMS Success (G26)|H.Nor.MS ''Stord'']] of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]], was trailing the convoy at a considerable distance.

==Battle==
The following day, in poor weather and heavy seas and with only minimal [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance to aid him, Rear Admiral Bey was unable to locate the convoy. Thinking he had overshot the enemy, he detached his destroyers and sent them southward in an attempt to increase the effective search area. Admiral Fraser, anticipating a German attack, had diverted the convoy northward, out of the area in which it was expected.

The now unescorted ''Scharnhorst'' encountered Burnett's cruisers shortly after 09:00 hours. At a distance of nearly 13,000 yards, the British cruisers opened fire and ''Scharnhorst'' responded with her own salvoes. While no hits were scored on the cruisers, the German battleship was struck twice, one shell destroying the [[radar]] controls, leaving ''Scharnhorst'' virtually blind in a mounting snowstorm. Without radar, gunners aboard the battleship were forced to aim at the enemy's muzzle flashes. This was made more difficult because two of the British cruisers were using a new flashless powder, leaving ''Norfolk'' the relatively easier target. Bey, now outgunned and believing he had engaged a battleship, turned south in an attempt to distance himself from the pursuers.

Once he believed he had shaken off his pursuers, Bey turned north-east in an attempt to circle round them. Shortly after noon, the cruisers were encountered once again. As the opposing forces exchanged fire, ''Scharnhorst'' scored hits on ''Norfolk'', disabling a turret and her radar. Following this exchange, Bey decided to return to port in ''Scharnhorst'', while he ordered the destroyers to attack the convoy at a position reported by a U-Boat. The reported position was out of date and the destroyers missed the convoy.

''Scharnhorst'' ran south for several hours. Burnett pursued, but both ''Sheffield'' and ''Norfolk'' suffered engine problems and dropped back. The lack of working radar aboard ''Scharnhorst'' prevented the Germans from taking advantage of the situation. Meanwhile, the ''Duke of York'', with her four destroyers already pressing ahead to try and get into torpedo launching positions, had picked up ''Scharnhorst'' on radar at 16:15 and was manoevering to bring her full broadside to bear.

At 16:48, ''Belfast'' fired starshell to illuminate ''Scharnhorst''. The battlecruiser was clearly visible from ''Duke of York'', with her turrets trained fore and aft. ''Duke of York'' opened fire at a range of 11,920 yards. ''Scharnhort's'' foremost turret ("Anton") was almost immediately disabled, and another salvo destroyed the ship's aeroplane hangar. Bey turned north, but was engaged by the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Belfast'', and turned east at full speed.

Although Bey was able to put some more distance between ''Scharnhorst'' and the British ships and scored two hits on the ''Duke of York'', his ship's fortunes turned at 18:20 hours when a shell pierced her armour belt and destroyed the number 1 boiler room. ''Scharnhorst'''s speed dropped to only 22 knots, and she was now vulnerable to the attacks of the destroyers. Five minutes later, Bey sent his final radio message to the German naval command: "We will fight on until the last shell is fired" (Claasen, 232).

At 18:50 hours, Scharnhorst turned to starboard to engage the destroyers ''Savage'' and ''Saumarez'', but this allowed ''Scorpion'' and the Norwegian destroyer ''Stord'' to attack, scoring one hit on the starboard side. As ''Scharnhorst'' continued to turn to avoid the torpedoes, ''Savage'' and ''Saumarez'' scored three hits on her port side. ''Saumarez'' was hit several times by ''Scharnhorst's'' secondary artillery and had eleven killed and eleven wounded.

Despite the torpedo hits, the battlecruiser still maintained a speed of 20 knots. Now however, with ''Scharnhorst'' illuminated by starshells "hanging over her like a chandelier", ''Duke of York'' and ''Jamaica'' resumed fire, at a range of only 10,400 yards. At 19:15, ''Belfast'' joined in from the north. The British vessels subjected the German ship to a deluge of shells, and the cruisers ''Jamaica'' and ''Belfast'' fired their remaining torpedoes at the slowing target. ''Scharnhorst'''s end came when the British destroyers ''Opportune'', ''Virago'', ''Musketeer'' and ''Matchless'' fired a further nineteen torpedoes at her. Wracked with hits and unable to flee, ''Scharnhorst'' finally capsized and sank at 19:45 hours on 26 December, her propellers still turning, at an estimated position of 72 degrees 16 minutes north latitude, 28 degrees 41 minutes east longitude. She was actually identified and filmed at N72 31, E28 15. Of her total complement of 1,968, only 36 were pulled from the frigid waters, 30 by ''Scorpion'' and 6 by ''Matchless''. Neither Rear Admiral Bey nor Captain Hintze were among those rescued, although they both were reported seen in the water after the ship sank.

==Aftermath==
Later in the evening of December 26 Admiral Fraser briefed his officers on board ''Duke of York'': "Gentlemen, the battle against [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] has ended in victory for us. I hope that if any of you are ever called upon to lead a ship into action against an opponent many times superior, you will command your ship as gallantly as ''Scharnhorst'' was commanded today".

The loss of ''Scharnhorst'' demonstrated the vital importance of radar in modern naval warfare. While the battleship should have been able to outgun all of her opponents (save the ''Duke of York''), the early loss of radar-assisted fire control combined with the problem of inclement weather left her at a significant disadvantage. In the aftermath of the battle, the Kriegsmarine commander [[Grossadmiral|Gro<U+00DF>admiral]] [[Karl D<U+00F6>nitz|D<U+00F6>nitz]] remarked, "Surface ships are no longer able to fight without effective radar equipment" (Claasen, 233).

''Stord'' and ''Scorpion'' fired their torpedoes from an easterly direction. ''Stord'' fired her eight torpedoes as she was about 1,500 yards from ''Scharnhorst'', while also firing with her guns and scoring hits. After the battle Admiral Fraser sent the following message to the Admiralty: "... Please convey to the C-in-C Norwegian Navy. ''Stord'' played a very daring role in the fight and I am very proud of her...".  In an interview in The Evening News on [[5 February]] 1944 the commanding officer of HMS ''Duke of York'' (Captain Guy Russell) said: "... the Norwegian destroyer ''Stord'' carried out the most daring attack of the whole action...".
