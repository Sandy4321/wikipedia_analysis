'''Pasir Panjang''' is an area in the south-western part of [[Singapore]]. It is located at the southern part of the [[Queenstown Planning Area]], an [[urban planning]] zone under the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. [[Kent Ridge]] is a topographical feature which runs through Pasir Panjang. 

==Etymology==
The name '''''Pasir Panjang''''' appears as "Passir Panjang" in 1851. The [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''pasir panjang'' literally means "long sand", a reference to the long sandy beach that stretched along the coast in this area. 

Pasir Panjang is known as ''hong heng sua'' in [[Min Nan|Hokkien]], meaning "Hong Heng's [[plantation]]".

==History==
Pasir Panjang Road, which once hugged the [[coastline]], was laid down as far as the Jurong River by [[John Turnbull Thomson]] by 1850. Thomson was Government [[Surveyor]] of Singapore from 1841 to 1853. 

In 1910, the Government took over the [[opium]] industry and a state-owned [[factory]] was established at Pasir Panjang. In the 1920s, many of the wealthy [[China|Chinese]] built holiday and residential [[bungalow]]s along the coast, some of which are still visible today in this area. In 1930, some of the [[Malay people|Malay]] families from the [[Kallang Basin|Kallang River Basin]] area were resettled here when [[Kallang Airport]] was constructed. In 1957, the Malay settlement here became known as the West Coast Malay Settlement. Right up till the early 1960s, this area contained many Malay [[fishing]] [[village]]s. 

Since the late 1960s, the whole length of the coast, from the [[Singapore River]] to [[Jurong]], has been [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] for [[wharves]], almost entirely devoted to [[Containerization|containerisation]]. The coastal area at Pasir Panjang has also been extensively reclaimed for the [[Pasir Panjang#Pasir Panjang Terminal|Pasir Panjang Terminal]] of the [[Port of Singapore]]. 

===Battle of Pasir Panjang===
[[Image:Lt_Adnan_Saidi.jpg|thumb|right|158px|Lieutenant Adnan bin Saidi]]
From [[13 February|13]] to [[15 February]] [[1942]], a decisive [[Battle of Singapore|battle for Singapore]] in [[World War II]] was fought on the slopes of Pasir Panjang, now [[Kent Ridge Park]]. 

The [[Japan|Japanese]] 18th Division, well-armed and heavily supported from the air, descended upon the ridge, determined to capture it from the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. Defending the [[ridge]] were the First and Second [[Royal Malay Regiment|Malay Regiments]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] Second Loyals Regiment, the [[Australia]]n Ben-Gun Carriers and the 44th [[India]]n Brigade. Although the Allied defences on Pasir Panjang Ridge outnumbered the Japanese, the attackers had more [[ammunition]] and were far more ruthless fighters.

The Allied forces put up a heroic show, especially [[Second Lieutenant]] [[Adnan bin Saidi]] of the Malay Regiment who led the combined Allied forces in battle. The Allied forces fought the Japanese to the bitter end. When ammunition ran out, they took on the Japanese in [[unarmed combat|hand-to-hand combat]] and did not give up even when they were down to their last few men.

The Japanese did everything they could to force a surrender, including creating a lethal [[oil]] fire in a [[drain]] that the soldiers had to cross to clear the ridge. Despite this, the brave Allied soldiers refused to abandon the ridge, preferably to die honourably than surrender. Two soldiers were burnt alive when they tried to cross the drain, while four others collapsed before they even got there.

Second Lieutenant Adnan, like a true hero, was one of the last defenders on the ridge. He was captured by the Japanese and [[bayonet]]ed to death. On [[14 February]] [[1942]], the Japanese won Pasir Panjang Ridge. The following day, the British surrendered.

==Highlights==
===Pasir Panjang Road===
Starting at Alexandra Road, Pasir Panjang Road continues to Clementi Road where it becomes West Coast Road. Since the building of the [[West Coast Highway (Singapore)|West Coast Highway]], Pasir Panjang Road has become a secondary road which now has less traffic.

The road passes through many developments built over a long period, ranging from some intact Malay [[kampong]] houses which were displaced from the Kallang Basin area in the 1930s (many of which have since been demolished), numerous villas, modern apartment and condominiums, Tiger Balm Gardens (now [[Haw Par Villa]]), The Haven (now the [[Salvation Army]] Pasir Panjang Corps) and Pasir Panjang Park. Pasir Panjang Park, established before [[World War II]] and about 11,800 square metres in area, is situated between Pasir Panjang Road and the [[wharves]] just past Pepys Road. At the end of Pepys Road is a small group of black and white [[colonial]] houses of the 1920s era which command a good view of the sea. 

Alexandra Road was not laid out until 1864. It connected Pasir Panjang Road to River Valley Road. In the past, the road "''in addition to being a useful line of [[communication]], the side [[ditch]]es improved the [[drainage]] of the neighbouring country''".

===Pasir Panjang Pillbox===
Concrete [[pillbox]]es were built along Singapore's eastern and western coasts as part of the British [[World War II]] defence. Installed in the pillboxes were [[machine gun]]s which could fire in any direction although they were usually oriented seawards. They were positioned at strategic intervals so that their [[field of fire|fields of fire]] would overlap, thereby reinforcing each other and covering almost the entire southern coastline. Together with [[land mine]]s and [[barbed wire]] on the beaches, the pillboxes and their guns comprised an important part of the [[coastal defence]] of Singapore.

The machine gun pillbox at Pasir Panjang is one of the few World War II [[relic]]s that has survived to the present day. It lies within the area defended by the First Malaya Brigade, and may have been used by the [[Royal Malay Regiment|Malay Regiment]] in their fierce battle against the 18th Japanese Division on Pasir Panjang Ridge in February 1942.

===Pasir Panjang Terminal===
In 1993,  the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), now [[Corporatization|corporatise]]d as [[PSA International]], started constructing a new [[container terminal]] at Pasir Panjang, the Pasir Panjang Terminal. The terminal is located approximately 7 [[Kilometre|km]] west of the company's other container terminals at [[Keppel Harbour]]. This new, [[S$]]7 billion terminal, represents an immense expansion of PSA's container port. When fully completed in 2009, it is expected to raise PSA's container handling capacity by a further 18 million [[TEU]]s (twenty-foot equivalent units) per year. The terminal's first four [[berth]]s, of the planned 26, opened in 1998, with two more berths becoming operational by the time of the terminal's official opening in March 2000.
