In 1880, the site of the Le Rosey campus was chosen by the school's founder, Paul-Emile Carnal, "a lover of nature, history and the countryside". The Le Rosey campus at Rolle is situated adjacent to the famous Lake Geneva. In 1911, the founder passed the ownership of Le Rosey to his son, Henri-Paul Carnal. In 1917, the school began to go to Gstaad in the [[German language|German]]-speaking Canton of Berne for the winter months to escape the dense fog that settles in on Lake Geneva.<ref>{{cite web

Under the same ownership, in 1967, Le Rosey admitted girls for the first time and opened a separate girls' campus. In 1980, the current owners, Philippe and Anne Gudin de la Sablonni<U+00E8>re, became the fourth generation of [[Executive director|Directors]] at Le Rosey. Louis Johannot, in an interview with [[Life Magazine]] in 1965, made a comment that received considerable attention: "The only reason I always try to meet and know the parents better is because it helps me to forgive their children."<ref>{{cite web

Carnal Hall, a planned CHF 45 million (estimated $43 million USD) Arts and Performance Centre, will be situated on Le Rosey's main campus at Rolle. Carnal Hall, named in honor of the founder Paul Carnal, his wife Marguerite, and their son Henri-Paul, will serve as a day-to-day arts centre for the students of Le Rosey and also serve as a cultural link between the students and the people of the La C<U+00F4>te region.<ref name="Carnal Hall">{{cite web

Separating ownership of Carnal Hall from Institut Le Rosey and granting it to the Rosey Foundation allows the public to contribute to the financing of the project. Institut Le Rosey will be the principal donor of the project. At the center of Carnal Hall there will be a performance hall seating up to 800 people with a modular balcony capable of seating an additional 800 people. The surrounding buildings will be composed of Carnal Hall's "Learning Centre", which will include 15 [[soundproofing|sound-proofed]] music classrooms, an additional 50-seat theatre, and 2 large art studios. Carnal Hall will also feature a conference room seating between 150 and 200 people, a professional kitchen for [[culinary]] instruction, and a 100-seat restaurant with an outdoor [[Terrace (stadium)|terrace]] for an additional 200 people. According to the Vaud regional newspaper, ''[[24 Heures (Switzerland)|24 Heures]]'', construction of the Carnal Hall project will begin in 2010 and will be completed in 2012.<ref name="Le Rosey plans massive art center"/><ref name="Carnal Hall"/>

=== The Rosey-Abantara Project ===
In 2004, Institut Le Rosey's Charity Committee undertook a [[humanitarian]] program to construct and maintain a [[private school]], the Rosey-Abantara School, in the suburbs of [[Bamako]], the [[capital city]] of [[Mali]], in [[Saharan Africa]].<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Rosey-Abantara is considered the most important charity project in Le Rosey's history. The project is entirely financed by the Le Rosey Charity Committee, with costs amounting to CHF 1,200,000 (approximately $1 million USD). An additional CHF 200,000 (approximately $167,000 USD) will be needed to purchase additional land for sports fields. By summer of 2007, primary construction work on the school was completed. By autumn of 2007, an estimated 1,500 [[Malian]] children will attend Rosey-Abantara. An independent construction report, by Alfrique Expertises, was published in May 2007, with the report finding the Rosey-Abantara school's structure to be solid. Le Rosey students and teachers undertake humanitarian missions throughout the year to the Rosey-Abantara project to teach Malian students.<ref>{{cite web

== Plans to leave Gstaad ==
In January 2008, Swiss economics magazine ''Bilanz'', a subsidiary of [[Edipresse|Groupe Edipresse]], published an interview with Le Rosey Director-General Philippe Gudin that revealed the school is currently seeking the sale of its Gstaad winter campus and the construction of a new campus in another location.<ref name="Le Rosey songe <U+00E0> quitter Gstaad"/> Gudin is currently in negotiations with the local authorities in Sch<U+00F6>nried, a ski resort village adjacent to Gstaad, to construct a new main campus on an undeveloped piece of land, but has run into difficulties due to zoning restrictions.<ref name="Le Rosey songe <U+00E0> quitter Gstaad"/> Reasons for moving to a new campus, according to the Director-General, include the fact that the school's personnel, who typically live on campus, are at maximum capacity, and that the student body can no longer increase in size due to the lack of space.<ref name="Le Rosey songe <U+00E0> quitter Gstaad"/> Gudin stated that for the moment the new winter campus location will be in Switzerland, but he has not ruled out the [[French Alps]].<ref name="Le Rosey songe <U+00E0> quitter Gstaad"/> The 100,000m<U+00B2> (approximately 25 acres) of prime real estate that the school occupies on Ried Hill in the centre of Gstaad is estimated to be worth several hundreds of millions of [[USD]], considering the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' reports that the price per square meter in Gstaad starts at 20,000 [[CHF]] (19,000 US$) and can rise to 45,000 CHF (43,000 US$).<ref>{{cite web
