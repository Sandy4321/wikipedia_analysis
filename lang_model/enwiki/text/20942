'''Shahrbaraz''', also known as '''Shahrvaraz''' ({{lang-fa|<U+0634><U+0647><U+0631><U+0628><U+0631><U+0627><U+0632>}}, {{lang-pal|<U+00010B67><U+00010B71><U+00010B68><U+00010B65><U+00010B65><U+00010B65><U+00010B70>}} <U+0160>ahrwar<U+0101>z, died 17 June 629), was king of the [[Sasanian Empire]] from 27 April 629 to 17 June 629. He usurped the throne from [[Ardashir III]], and was killed by Sasanian nobles after forty days. Before usurping the Sasanian throne he was a general (''[[spahbed]]'') under [[Khosrau II]] (590&ndash;628).  His name Shahrbaraz is actually an honorific title, and means "the Boar of the Empire", attesting to his dexterity in military command and his warlike person, as the boar was the animal associated with the Zoroastrian [[Yazata|Izad]] [[Verethragna|Vahram]], the epitome of victory.

==Early life==
Shahrbaraz belonged to the [[House of Mihran]],<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=181}}</ref> one of the [[Seven Parthian clans]]; he was the son of a certain Ardashir. During Shahrbaraz's later life, he joined the [[Sasanian army]] where he became ''[[spahbed]]'' of [[<U+0160>ahrest<U+0101>n<U+012B>h<U+0101> <U+012B> <U+0112>r<U+0101>n<U+0161>ahr#Kusts of Eranshahr|N<U+0113>mr<U+014D>z]]. He was married to the sister of the Sasanian king [[Khosrau II]], Mirhran, whom Shahrbaraz had one boy with named [[Shapur-i Shahrvaraz]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=205}}</ref> Shahrbaraz also had another son named [[Niketas the Persian]], who may be from the same woman or from another.

==War against the Byzantine Empire==
{{see also|Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian War of 602<U+2013>628}}
Shahrbaraz is first mentioned when Khosrau II started the last and most devastating of the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian wars]], which was going to last 26 years. Khosrau II, along with Shahrbaraz and his other best generals, conquered [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]] and [[Edessa]] in 604, and in the north, the Byzantines were driven back to the old, [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian War of 572<U+2013>591#Aftermath|pre-591 frontier]] before Khosrau II gave them most of Persian Armenia, parts of Mesopotamia and western half of Iberia. After reconquering lost territory,  Khosrau II withdrew from the battlefield and handed military operations to his best generals. Shahrbaraz was one of them. In 610, [[Heraclius]], an [[Armenian people|Armenian]]<ref name="Treadgold p. 287">{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=287}}</ref> of probable [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] descent,<ref name = "A. Shapur Shahbazi">{{harvnb|Shapur Shahbazi|2005}}, "Sasanian Dynasty"</ref> revolted against the Byzantine Emperor [[Phocas]] and killed him, crowning himself as Emperor of the Byzantine Empire.<ref name="Olster p. 133">[[#refOlster1993|Olster 1993]], p. 133.</ref> After becoming [[Byzantine Emperor]], he prepared a major counter-attack against the Sasanians outside [[Antioch]] in 613, but was decisively defeated by Shahrbaraz, who [[Battle of Antioch (613)|inflicted heavy losses]] on the Byzantine army and then captured the city,<ref name="PLRE271">{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=1278}}</ref>{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|pp=70<U+2013>71}} giving the Sasanians naval access to the [[Mediterranean sea]].

After the Byzantine defeat outside Antioch, Heraclius and his brother [[Theodore (brother of Heraclius)|Theodore]], along with [[Nicetas (cousin of Heraclius)|General Nicetas]], combined their armies in [[Syria]], but were defeated by Shahrbaraz and his forces who besieged [[Damascus]] and captured it along with a large number of Byzantine troops as prisoners.{{sfn|Kaegi|2003|pp=75<U+2013>77}}

One of most important events during his career was when he led the Sasanian army towards [[Palaestina Prima|Palaestina]], and after a bloody siege captured [[Jerusalem]], a city sacred to the [[Christianity|Christians]]. After his conquest of Jerusalem the [[True Cross|Holy Cross]] was carried away in triumph. In 618, Shahrbaraz was ordered by Khosrau II to invade [[Egypt]], and by 619, [[Alexandria]], the capital of [[Diocese of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]], was in [[Sasanian]] hands.<ref>{{harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002a|pp=196, 235}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Howard-Johnston|2006|pp=10, 90}}</ref>

After the fall of Alexandria, Shahrbaraz and his forces extended Sasanian rule southwards along the [[Nile]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002a|p=196}}</ref> By 621, the province was securely in Sasanian hands. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the [[Sasanian Empire]] in [[Anatolia]]. Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&pg=PA112 114]}}</ref>

After Heraclius' victory, he marched towards [[Caucasian Albania]] and wintered there.<ref name = "Kaegi128">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=128}}</ref> Shahrbaraz, along with [[Shahin Vahmanzadegan|Shahin]] and [[Shahraplakan]] were later sent by the orders of Khosrau II to trap the forces of Heraclius.<ref name = "Kaegi129">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=129}}</ref> Shahin managed to rout the Byzantine army. Due to jealousy between the Sasanian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army to take part in the glory of the victory. Heraclius met them at [[Tigranakert (Silvan)|Tigranakert]] and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the remnants of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down.<ref name = "Kaegi130" /><ref name="frontier175">{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002b|p=204}}</ref> At [[Aliovit]], Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius launched a surprise night attack on the Persian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his [[harem]], baggage, and men.<ref name = "Kaegi130">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=130}}</ref>

Heraclius spent the rest of winter to the north of [[Lake Van]]. In 625, his forces attempted to push back towards the Euphrates. In a mere seven days, he bypassed [[Mount Ararat]] and the 200 miles along the [[Murat River|Arsanias River]] to capture [[Diyarbakr|Amida]] and [[Martyropolis]], important fortresses on the upper [[Tigris]].<ref name = "Oman210">{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA210 210]}}</ref><ref name = "Kaegi131">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=131}}</ref> Heraclius then carried on towards the Euphrates, pursued by Shahrbaraz. According to Arab sources, he was stopped at the Satidama or Batman Su River and defeated; Byzantine sources, however, do not mention this incident.<ref name = "Kaegi131" /> Another minor skirmish between Heraclius and Shahrbaraz took place at the [[Seyhan River|Sarus river]] near [[Adana]].<ref name="Kaegi132">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=132}}</ref> Shahrbaraz stationed his forces across the river from the Byzantines.<ref name = "Norwich91">{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=91}}</ref> A bridge spanned the river, and the Byzantines immediately charged across. Shahrbaraz feigned retreat to lead the Byzantines into an ambush, and the vanguard of Heraclius' army was destroyed within minutes. The Persians, however, had neglected to cover the bridge, and Heraclius charged across with the rearguard, unafraid of the arrows that the Persians fired, turning the tide of battle against the Persians.<ref name = "Norwich92">{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=92}}</ref> Shahrbaraz expressed his admiration at Heraclius to a renegade Greek: "See your Emperor! He fears these arrows and spears no more than would an anvil!"<ref name="Norwich92"/> The [[Battle of Sarus]] was a successful retreat for the Byzantines that [[panegyrists]] magnified.<ref name="Kaegi132" /> In the aftermath of the battle, the Byzantine army wintered at [[Trebizond]].<ref name="Norwich92"/>

===Siege of Constantinople===
{{main|Siege of Constantinople (626)}}
Shahrbaraz, along with a smaller army, later managed to slip through Heraclius' flanks and bee-lined for [[Chalcedon]], the Sasanian base across the [[Bosphorus]] from [[Constantinople]]. Khosrau II coordinated with the [[Khagan]] of the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] so as to launch a coordinated attack on Constantinople from both European and Asiatic sides.<ref name = "Oman210" /> The army of Shahrbaraz stationed themselves at Chalcedon, while the Avars placed themselves on the European side of Constantinople and destroyed the [[Valens Aqueduct|Aqueduct of Valens]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=nYbnr5XVbzUC&pg=PA297 297]}}</ref> Because of the [[Byzantine navy]]'s control of the Bosphorus strait, however, the Sasanians could not send troops to the European side to aid their ally.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=133}}</ref><ref name ="Kaegi140">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=140}}</ref> This reduced the effectiveness of the siege, because the Sasanians were experts in siege warfare.<ref name="frontier179">{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002b|pp=179<U+2013>181}}</ref> Furthermore, the [[Sasanians]] and Avars had difficulties communicating across the guarded Bosphorus<U+2014>though undoubtedly, there was some communication between the two forces.<ref name = "Oman210" /><ref name ="Kaegi140" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=134}}</ref>

On 7 August, a fleet of Sasanian rafts ferrying troops across the Bosphorus was surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the [[Golden Horn]], while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from 6 to 7 August also failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=137}}</ref> With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to threaten Constantinople seriously again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople was over.<ref name = "Oman211">{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211 211]}}</ref><ref name="Norwich93">{{Harvnb|Norwich|1997|p=93}}</ref>

Disappointed by Shahrbaraz's failure, Khosrau II sent a messenger bearing a letter to [[Kardarigan (7th century)|Kardarigan]], who was the second-in-command of the Sasanian army. The letter said that Kardarigan should kill Shahrbaraz and take his army back to [[Ctesiphon]], but the bearers of the letter were intercepted in [[Galatia]] by Byzantine soldiers, who gave the letter to [[Constantine III (Byzantine emperor)|Constantine III]] who in turn gave it to Heraclius. After reading the letter, he offered to show the letter to Shahrbaraz in a meeting at Constantinople. Shahrbaraz accepted his proposal and met Heraclius at Constantinople, where he read the letter and switched over to Heraclius' side.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=148}}</ref> Shahrbaraz then changed the contents of the letter, making it state that Khosrau II wanted 400 officers killed, ensuring that Kardarigan and the rest of the army remained loyal to him.<ref name="frontier171">{{Harvnb|Dodgeon|Greatrex|Lieu|2002b|p=205}}</ref> Shahrbaraz then moved his army to northern Syria, where he could easily decide to support either Khosrau or Heraclius at a moment's notice. Still, with the neutralization of Khosrau's most skilled general, Heraclius deprived his enemy of some of his best and most experienced troops, while securing his flanks prior to his invasion of Persia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|p=151}}</ref>

==Overthrow of Khosrau II==
In 627, Khosrau sent Shahrbaraz a letter, which said that he should send his army to Ctesiphon. Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, and moved to [[Asuristan]], where he set up a camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrau then sent [[Farrukhzad]] to negotiate with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrau and joined Shahrbaraz.<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=147}}</ref>

One year later, the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, who were tired of war against the Byzantines and Khosrau's oppressive policies, freed Khosrau's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the [[House of Ispahbudhan]] represented by ''spahbed'' [[Farrukh Hormizd]] and his two sons [[Rostam Farrokhzad]] and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by [[Varaztirots II Bagratuni]]; and finally the [[Kanarang]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=173}}</ref> In February, Kavadh, along with [[Aspad Gushnasp]], captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrau II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and with the aid of [[Piruz Khosrow]], executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrau II's favorite son [[Mardanshah (Sasanian prince)|Mardanshah]]. Three days later, he ordered [[Mihr Hormozd]] to execute his father. With the agreement of the Persian nobles, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, which made the Byzantines regain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a [[war indemnity]], along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.<ref name = "Oman212">{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA212 212]}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[http://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&pg=PA178 178], [http://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&pg=PA189 189<U+2013>190]}}</ref>

Following the loss of territory required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire. This divided the resources of the country. Furthermore, dams and canals became derelict, and a devastating plague erupted in the western provinces of [[Persia]], killing half of the population along with [[Kavadh II]], who was succeeded by [[Ardashir III]].<ref name = "A. Shapur Shahbazi" />

==Usurping the throne==
After the death of Kavadh II, Heraclius sent Shahrbaraz a letter saying: {{Cquote|''Now that the Iranian king is dead, the throne and the kingdom has come to you. I bestow it on you, and on your offspring after you. If an army is necessary, I shall send to your assistance as many [troops] as you may need.''<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=177}}</ref>}}

On 27 April 629 (or 630)<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=182}}</ref> Shahrbaraz [[Siege of Ctesiphon (629)|besieged Ctesiphon]] with a force of 6,000 men.<ref name="Pourshariati 2008 180">{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=180}}</ref> He was, however, unable to capture the city, and then made an alliance with Piruz Khosrow, the leader of the Parsig (Persian) faction, and the previous minister of the Empire during the reign of Ardashir's father, Kavadh II. He also made an alliance with Namdar Jushnas, who had succeeded him as the ''spahbed'' of N<U+0113>mr<U+014D>z in 626.<ref name="Pourshariati 2008 180"/> Shahrbaraz, with the aid of these two powerful figures, captured Ctesiphon, and executed Ardashir III along with many Sasanian nobles, including Ardashir's minister [[Mah-Adhur Gushnasp]]. Shahrbaraz then became the new ''[[shah]]'' (king) of the Sasanian Empire,<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|pages=181, 183}}</ref> and killed Kardarigan, who opposed Shahrbaraz after his usurpation of the Sasanian throne.<ref name="PLRE271">{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=271}}</ref> Heraclius also acknowledged Shahrbaraz's Christian son [[Niketas the Persian|Niketas]], as his heir. An Iranian Christian as the heir of the Sasanian Empire opened the chances of the Christianization of Persia.<ref name="Kaegi1911">{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=188<U+2013>189, 206}}</ref> After forty days, Shahrbaraz was murdered by Farrukh Hormizd, who then helped [[Borandukht]], the daughter of Khosrau II, to ascend the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|p=184}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Shahrbaraz had played an important role in the [[Byzantine<U+2013>Sasanian War of 602<U+2013>628]], and the events that occurred after the war; his mutiny against Khosrau II resulted in a Byzantine [[Pyrrhic]] victory and caused the Sasanian Empire to fall into a civil war. After the death of Shahrbaraz, his son [[Shapur-i Shahrvaraz]] deposed Borandukht and became king of the Sasanian Empire. His reign, however, did not last long, and he was shortly deposed by the Sasanian nobles.<ref>{{harvnb|Pourshariati|2008|pages=204, 205}}</ref> During the same period, Niketas entered in the service of the Byzantines, and would later appear as one of the Byzantine generals at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] during the [[Arab<U+2013>Byzantine wars]].<ref name="PLRE911">{{harvnb|Martindale|Jones|Morris|1992|p=943}}</ref>
