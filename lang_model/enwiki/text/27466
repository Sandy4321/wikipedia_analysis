==History==
{{main article|History of Duke University}}
===Beginnings===
[[Image:Wdukebuild.jpg|right|thumb|One of the first buildings on the original Durham campus (East Campus), the Washington Duke Building ("Old Main") was destroyed by a fire in 1911.]]

Duke University started as Brown's Schoolhouse, a private subscription school founded in 1838 in [[Randolph County, North Carolina|Randolph County]] in the present-day town of [[Trinity, North Carolina|Trinity]].<ref name="Chron"> [http://www.lib.duke.edu/archives/history/chronology.html A Chronology of Significant Events in Duke University's History.]  ''Duke University Archives.'' Retrieved on [[January 12]], [[2007]].</ref> The school was organized by the Union Institute Society, a group of [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], and in 1841 North Carolina issued a charter for Union Institute Academy. The academy was renamed Normal College in 1851 and then Trinity College in 1859 because of support from the Methodist Church. In 1892, Trinity moved to Durham, largely due to generosity from [[Washington Duke]] and [[Julian Carr (industrialist)|Julian S. Carr]], powerful and respected Methodists who had grown wealthy through the tobacco industry.<ref name="Narra">King, William E. [http://www.lib.duke.edu/archives/history/narrativehistory.html A Brief Narrative History]. ''Duke University Libraries'', 2002. Retrieved on [[January 12]], [[2007]].</ref>  Washington Duke gave what was then known as Trinity College a $100,000 endowment in [[1896]], with the stipulation that the college "open its doors to women, placing them on an equal footing with men."<ref name="dukemag">{{cite web |url= http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111206/depret.html|title= Retrospective|accessdate=2007-07-30 |publisher= ''Duke Magazine''|date= 2006-11}}</ref>

In 1924, Washington Duke's son, [[James Buchanan Duke|James B. Duke]], established [[The Duke Endowment]] with a $40 million ($434 million in [[inflation|2005 dollars]]) trust fund. The annual income of the fund was to be distributed to hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, three colleges, and Trinity College. [[William Preston Few]], the president of Trinity College, insisted that the university be named Duke University, and James B. Duke agreed that it would be a memorial to his father. Money from the endowment allowed the university to grow quickly. Duke's original campus (East Campus) was rebuilt from 1925 to 1927 with Georgian-style buildings. By 1930, the majority of the Gothic style buildings on the campus one mile west were completed, and construction on West Campus culminated with the completion of Duke Chapel in 1935.<ref name="Narra">King, William E.

===Expansion and growth===
Engineering, which had been taught since 1903, became a [[Pratt School of Engineering|separate school]] in 1939. In athletics, Duke hosted and competed in the only [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] ever played outside of California in [[Wallace Wade Stadium]] in [[1942 in sports|1942]]. Increased [[student activism|activism]] on campus during the 1960s prompted [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] to speak at the university on the civil rights movement's progress on [[November 14]] [[1964]].<ref name="Chron">[http://www.lib.duke.edu/archives/history/chronology.html#University A Chronology of Significant Events].

The separate Woman's College merged back with Trinity as the [[liberal arts]] college for both men and women in 1972. Beginning in the 1970s, Duke administrators began a long-term effort to strengthen Duke's reputation both nationally and internationally. Interdisciplinary work was emphasized, as was recruiting minority faculty and students.<ref>[http://www.duke.edu/web/annualreport/interdisc.htm Duke Annual Report 2000/2001-Interdisciplinary].

{{main article|Duke Blue Devils men's basketball}}

Duke men's basketball, a traditional powerhouse, is the fourth most victorious program of all-time.  The team has captured three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|National Championships]], while attending 14 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Final Four|Final Fours]] and nine Championship games.  Additionally, the Blue Devils are tied with the [[University of North Carolina]] for the most [[List of Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball tournament champions|ACC Championships]] with 16 and have had the most National Players of the Year in the nation with 11. Seventy-one players have been drafted in the [[NBA Draft]], while 55 players have been honored as [[All-America]]ns. Duke's program is one of only two to have been to at least one Final Four and one National Championship game in each of the last five decades.
