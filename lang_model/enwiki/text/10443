Captain '''Edward''' "'''Ned'''" '''Low''' (also spelled '''Lowe''' or '''Loe'''; ca. 1690 <U+2013> ca. 1724) was a notorious English [[pirate]] during the latter days of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], in the early 18th century. He was born around 1690 into poverty in [[Westminster]], [[London]], and was a thief from a young age. Low moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], as a young man. His wife died in childbirth in late 1719. Two years later, he became a pirate, operating off the coasts of [[New England]] and the [[Azores]], and in the [[Caribbean]].

He captained a number of ships, usually maintaining a small fleet of three or four. Low and his pirate crews captured at least a hundred ships during his short career, burning most of them.<ref name="guide"/> Although he was active for only three years, Low remains notorious as one of the most vicious pirates of the age, with a reputation for violently torturing his victims before killing them.<ref name="portcities">{{cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.57/chapterId/1004/London-and-the-pirates.html|title=London and the Pirates|accessdate=2007-09-25|publisher=PortCities|year=2004}}</ref>

As a young man, he was said to be a [[pickpocket]] and gambler, playing games of chance with the footmen of the nearby [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref name="pyrates"/>

Most of his family appear to have been thieves. While young, his brother, Richard, was small for his age and is said to have been carried around in a basket on a friend's back; in a crowd, Richard would snatch the hats and [[wig]]s of passers-by. Richard Low later took to other forms of criminal activity and ended up [[hanging|hanged]] at [[Tyburn]] in 1707 for the [[burglary]] of a house in [[Stepney]].<ref name="pyrates" /><ref name="new1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?path=sessionsPapers%2F17071210.xml|title=Old Bailey Proceedings Online (www.oldbaileyonline.org, version 6.0), trial of Richard Low (t17071210-24)|date=10 December 1707|accessdate=7 September 2011|publisher=[[Old Bailey]]}}</ref>

==Life in Boston==
As he grew older, Low tired of pickpocketing and thievery and turned to [[burglary]]. Eventually, he left England, and travelled alone to the [[New World]] around 1710. He spent three to four years in various locations, before settling in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="new1"/> On 12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of Boston.<ref name="eliza">{{cite web|title=Boston, MA Marriages 1646<U+2013>1751, from Record Commissioner's Reports 9 (1649<U+2013>1699) and 150 (1700<U+2013>1751)|year=1898|url=http://bos-gw.rays-place.com/bos/bos-mar-14.htm|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref> They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719.<ref name="new1"/>

Eliza died in childbirth, leaving Low with his daughter.<ref name="pyrates"/> The loss of his wife had a profound effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to [[press-gang]] married men into joining his crews.<ref name="new1"/> He would also allow women to return to port safely.<ref name="annals">{{Cite book| url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/philadelphia/areahistory/watson0208.txt|title=Watson's Annals of Philadelphia And Pennsylvania|year=1857|chapter=4<U+2013>5, Vol II|first=John Fanning|last=Watson|authorlink=John F.

Low was employed as a patron, supervising the loading and carrying of the logs. One day, he returned to the ship when hungry, but was told by the captain he would have to wait to eat, and that he and his men would have to be satisfied with a ration of [[rum]]. At this, Low "took up a loaded musket and fired at the captain but missed him, [and] shot another poor fellow through the throat".<ref name="bay">{{cite web|title=When Pirates Ruled...|url=http://www.bayislandsvoice.com/issue-v3-3.htm|author=Harper, Matthew|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=Bay Islands Voice|date=March 2005}}</ref>

Following this failed [[mutiny]], Low and his friends were forced to leave the boat. A day later, Low led the twelve-man gang<U+2014>which included [[Francis Spriggs|Francis Farrington Spriggs]], who went on to become a notorious pirate in his own right<U+2014>in taking over a small sloop off the coast of Rhode Island.

==Piracy==

===Lieutenant===
Low, using his newly captured ship, lay in wait on the popular shipping route between Boston and New York. Within a few days, he and his crew seized a sloop out of Rhode Island, and plundered it. His crew cut the rigging away to prevent the sloop returning too quickly to port to raise the alarm.<ref name="own"/> He then captured a number of unarmed [[cargo ship|merchantmen]] near Port Rosemary.<ref name="bucc">{{cite book |last=Stockton |first=Frank Richard|title=Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts|publisher=Macmillan Books|isbn=0-02-788520-8|pages=263<U+2013>277|chapter=XXIX<U+2014>A Pirate from Boyhood|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17188/17188-h/17188-h.htm| year=1897}}</ref>

Low headed south and began operating in the waters of [[Cayman Islands|Grand Cayman]], with a period as [[lieutenant]] to the established pirate [[George Lowther (pirate)|George Lowther]], who captained the ''Happy Delivery'',<ref name="guide"/><ref name="bucc"/> a 100-[[long ton|ton]] Rhode Island sloop with eight [[cannon]] and ten swivel guns.

Following a number of successful raids, Lowther eventually captured a large 6-gun [[brigantine]] (named ''Rebecca'') on 28 May 1722.<ref name="pyrates"/> He gave it to Low to captain. With a crew of 44, Low amicably dissolved his partnership with Lowther.<ref name="bucc"/>

===Pirate captain===
In one notable raid in June 1722, Low and his crew attacked thirteen New England fishing vessels sheltering at anchor in Port Roseway, [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. Although outnumbered, Low hoisted his [[Jolly Roger]] flag and declared that no mercy would be given to the fishermen if any resisted. The fleet submitted and Low's men robbed every vessel. Low chose the largest, an 80-ton [[schooner]] which he renamed ''The Fancy'' and armed with 10 guns, to become his [[flagship]].<ref name="guide">{{cite web|url=http://www.chronofus.net/wargames/piracy/captains/low.htm|title=Guide to Edward Low|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=chronofus.net|year=2004}} Bibliography for data: [http://www.chronofus.net/wargames/piracy/bibliography.htm]</ref>

Low's tactics consisted primarily of hoisting [[false colours]] and approaching an unsuspecting vessel.<ref name="bay"/> Off the coast of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St John's]], [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], Low mistook a fully armed [[man-of-war]] for a fishing boat, and barely escaped.<ref name="drake"/> He moved on to [[Conception Bay]], capturing a number of boats around the [[Grand Banks]] southeast of Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic to the [[Azores]].

He also captured an English vessel with two Portuguese passengers aboard.

Low abandoned his plans for plundering the rich shipping trade off the coast of Brazil, and moved on to the Caribbean. George Roberts, a mate on the British ship ''King Sagamore'', recounted a meeting with Low aboard the ''Pink''.

===Capsizing of the ''Rose Pink''===
Forty [[League (unit)|leagues]] (120&nbsp;nautical miles or around 220&nbsp;km) to the east of [[Surinam]], Low and his fleet of two ships (the ''Rose Pink'' and the ''Fancy'', captained by a young [[Charles Harris (pirate)|Charles Harris]]) dropped anchor to remove growth such as [[seaweed]] and [[barnacles]] from the outside of the boats, in a process known as [[careening]], necessary because no [[dry dock]] was available to pirates.<ref name="new3">{{cite book |author=Dow, George Francis; Edmonds, John Henry|title= The Pirates of the New England Coast, 1630<U+2014>1730 |origyear= 1923|publisher= Courier Dover|isbn=0-486-29064-6|pages=200<U+2013>217|chapter=XII<U+2014> The Brutal Career and Miserable End of Ned Low |year=1996 |oclc=33246073}} Some content available on [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.com/books?id=0kEftr23bFAC&pg=RA1-PA141&lpg=RA1-PA141&dq=%22ned+low%22+pirate&source=web&ots=OtXQ11XSW8&sig=ho73o8LCuDnIVzJGhb39Lr9M56s#PPR8,M1].</ref>

Still relatively inexperienced, Low ordered too many men to the outside of the boat to work on the buildup, and the ''Rose Pink'' tipped over too far. The [[porthole]]s had been left open, and the vessel took on water and sank, with the death of two men. The ''Pink'' had been carrying most of the provisions, and Low<U+2014>by now captaining a captured [[schooner]], the ''Squirrel''<U+2014>and his crew were forced to strictly ration their fresh water to half a [[pint]] (around 275&nbsp;[[litre|ml]]) per man, per day.<ref name="new3"/>

Failing to reach their initial destination of [[Tobago]] due to light winds and strong [[Ocean current|currents]], Low's depleted fleet made it to [[Grenada]], a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men came out from hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the ''Ranger''), gave the schooner ''Squirrel'' to his [[quartermaster]], [[Francis Spriggs|Spriggs]], who renamed it the ''Delight'' before sailing away in the middle of the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.<ref name="spriggs">{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/spriggs_francis.htm|title=Francis Spriggs|first=Rob|last=Ossian|accessdate=2007-09-27|publisher=thepirateking.com}}</ref>

The new fleet captured many more sloops, including one Low kept, naming it the ''Fortune''. During a trial on 10 July 1723 for a number of Low's crew, a sailor on board the ''Fortune'' named John Welland recalled how Low stripped his boat, including gold to the value of <U+00A3>150, then beat him and cut off his ear with a [[cutlass]].<ref name="memo">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_mcBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA267&dq=%22Edward+Low%22|author=Updike, Wilkins|title=Memoirs of the Rhode Island Bar|chapter=Appendix|pages=260<U+2013>294|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|year=1833}} <U+2013> recount of the trial of many of Low's men, including verdict and witness statements, and Low's articles.</ref>

Following this, Low's fleet captured a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship called the ''Nostra Signiora de Victoria'' on 25 January 1723.

Low, like other pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into surrendering, by threatening to kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted ship would hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals.<ref name="rediker">{{cite book|author=Rediker, Marcus|title=Villains of all Nations: Atlantic Pirates in the Golden Age|publisher=Beacon Publishing|chapter=1<U+2014>A Tale of Two Terrors|pages=14<U+2013>15|origyear=2004|isbn=1-84467-008-2|year=2004|oclc=55884381}} Some content available at [[Google Books]]: [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jQyoDRbGgucC]</ref> One failed [[torture]] session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth.

===A defeat===

[[Image:Low presenting a Pistol and Bowl of Punch.jpg|thumb|250px|''Low presenting a Pistol and Bowl of Punch'', from ''A Pirate's Own Book'' (1837).]]

Low, Harris and their ships left the Azores for the [[Carolinas]]. On 10 June 1723, they suffered a resounding defeat in a [[Action of 10 June 1723|battle]] with {{HMS|Greyhound}}, a heavily armed man of war.<ref name="bucc"/> The ''Greyhound'' had been dispatched under the command of Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet.

Twenty-five of the crew of the ''Ranger'', including the ship's doctor, were tried between 10 July and 12 July, with Solgard giving evidence and recounting the battle.<ref name="memo"/> The men were hanged for felony, piracy and robbery, near [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]], on 19 July 1723.<ref name="guide"/><ref name="bucc"/> Harris was sent back to England and hanged at [[Execution Dock]] in [[Wapping]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gosse|first=P|title=The Pirates' Who's Who, Giving Particulars Of The Lives and Deaths Of The Pirates And Buccaneers|publisher=Lenox Hill|page=155|year=1968}}</ref> When Solgard returned to New York, he was presented with the [[freedom of the city]] and a gold [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuffbox]] for his part in bringing some of Low's crew to justice.<ref name="annals"/>

===End of Low's career===
Low, still captaining the ''Fancy'', sailed north. He captured a whaling vessel 80&nbsp;miles (130&nbsp;km) out at sea, and in a foul mood following the encounter with the ''Greyhound'' and the loss of his right-hand man, Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death (they were lucky, and reached Nantucket after a difficult journey).<ref name="nyt"/>

Remaining off the coast of North America, his crew took a fishing boat near [[Block Island]]. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused to carry out his orders to torture the fishermen.<ref name="nyt"/>

Heading south again, Low captured a 22-gun French ship and a large [[Virginia]]n merchant vessel, the ''Merry Christmas'', in late June 1723. Following the defeat by the ''Greyhound'', Low became "peculiarly cruel" to his English victims.<ref name="annals"/> His fleet of three ships rejoined forces with [[George Lowther (pirate)|George Lowther]] in July. In late 1723, Low and Lowther's fleet captured the ''Delight'' off the coast of [[Guinea]], mounting fourteen guns on her, with command being given to Spriggs. Two days later, Spriggs and Lowther both abandoned Low, leaving him the ''Merry Christmas'', by now mounted with 34 guns, as his sole ship.<ref name="pyrates"/>

=== Fate ===
There are conflicting reports on the circumstances of Edward Low's death. [[Charles Johnson (pirate biographer)|Charles Johnson]]<U+2014>considered by some to be [[Daniel Defoe]] writing under a [[pseudonym]]<ref name="flag">{{cite book|authorlink=David Cordingly|last=Cordingly|first=David|title=Under the Black Flag|origyear=1996|publisher=[[Random House]]|isbn=0-15-600549-2|year=1997|oclc=36969645|nopp=true|page=xix}}</ref><U+2014>stated in his ''[[A General History of the Pyrates]]'', at odds with other sources, that Edward Low and the ''Fancy'' were last sighted near the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]] and [[Guinea]] but at the time of his 1724 book, no further reports had surfaced. He noted one rumour that Low was sailing for Brazil and another that Low's ship sank in a storm with the loss of all hands.<ref name="pyrates"/> The [[National Maritime Museum]] in London states that he was never caught, ending his days in [[Brazil]].<ref name="portcities"/>

''The Pirates Own Book'' and Ossian both suggest that Low was set adrift without provisions by the crew of the ''Merry Christmas'', in a [[mutiny]] brought about by Low's murdering of a sleeping subordinate following an argument.<ref name="ossian"/> Low was subsequently rescued by a French ship; when the French authorities learned of his identity he was brought to trial, and was hanged in [[Martinique]], in 1724.<ref name="own"/>

==Flags==
[[Image:Edward Low Flag.svg|thumb|The [[pirate flag]] used by Edward Low]]
Initially, Low used the same [[pirate flag|flag]] as [[Edward Teach]] ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red [[skeleton|skeletal figure]] on a black background, which became notorious.<ref name="psite">{{cite web|url=http://www.piratesinfo.com/main.php|accessdate=2007-09-27|title=piratesinfo.com}}</ref> He first flew his own flag in late July 1723.<ref name="pyrates"/>

Low also used a green silk flag with a yellow figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this ''Green Trumpeter'' was hoisted on the [[mizzen]] peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.<ref name="guide"/>

==Articles==
Low had a set of [[Pirate code of the Brethren|Articles]], a [[code of conduct]] and an ironic reference to the Royal Navy's own [[Articles of War (Royal Navy)|Articles of War]].<ref name="memo"/> The Articles listed below are attributed to Low by the ''[[Boston News-Letter]]''. The first eight of these articles are essentially identical to those attributed to [[George Lowther (pirate)|Lowther]] by Charles Johnson.<ref name="pyrates"/>

It is likely that both reports are correct and that Low and Lowther shared the same articles, with Low's two extra articles being an ''[[ordonnance]]'', or amendment, adopted after the two crews separated.

Edward Low's acts, along with those of other pirates of the period such as [[Blackbeard|Edward Teach]], [[Bartholomew Roberts]] ("Black Bart"), and [[William Fly]], led to a great increase in the military presence to protect shipping lanes, resulting in the effective end of the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].<ref name="rediker"/>

By 1700, the European states had enough troops and ships at their disposal, following the end of a number of wars, to begin better protecting their important colonies in the West Indies and in the Americas, without relying on the aid of [[privateer]]s. [[Piracy in the Caribbean|Pirates based in the Caribbean]] were chased from the seas by a new British [[Royal Navy]] squadron based at [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], and a smaller group of Spanish privateers, sailing from the [[Spanish Main]], known as the ''Guarda de Costa'' (Coast Guard in English), or simply the ''Guarda''.<ref name="own"/><ref name="rediker"/>

Less is recorded of Low than of other equally prolific pirates such as Teach and [[Stede Bonnet]]. [[Howard Pyle]], in an 1880 children's book on pirates, said: "No one stood higher in the trade than [Low], and no one mounted to more lofty altitudes of bloodthirsty and unscrupulous wickedness. 'Tis strange that so little has been written and sung of this man of might, for he was as worthy of story and of song as was Blackbeard."<ref name="pyle">{{cite book|title=Howard Pyle's Book of Pirates|authorlink=Howard Pyle|last=Pyle|first=Howard|publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/973/973-h/973-h.htm|year=1903}}</ref> Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], in his work ''The Green Flag'', described Low as "savage and desperate", and a man of "amazing and grotesque brutality".<ref name="acd"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' said "Low and his crew became the terror of the Atlantic, and his depredations were committed on every part of the ocean, from the coast of Brazil to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland".<ref name="nyt"/>

Low has featured on stamps and commemorative currency around the Caribbean. A [[postage stamp]] featuring Low was [[List of people on stamps of the Cayman Islands|commissioned]] by the [[Cayman Islands]] in 1975,<ref name="scott">[[Scott catalogue]], volume II</ref> and in 1994 the government of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] featured Edward Low and his brigantine, ''Rebecca'', on a legal tender one hundred-[[East Caribbean dollar|dollar]] bill made of [[gold leaf]].<ref name="100dollar">{{cite web|url=http://www.larryvoyer.com/Piratical/pirate%20pages/banknotes-antiqua.htm|title=Pirates, Buccaneers & Privateers<U+2014>An English Graphical Biography|last=Voyer|first=J.

"Ned Low" is one of the pirates featured on the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean ride]] at the [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] theme park in [[California]].

Some of Low's haunts, such as the waters around the [[Isles of Shoals]] off New Hampshire and Isle Haute in [[Nova Scotia]], attract [[treasure hunter]]s who seek artifacts in the ships he sank.<ref name="haute">{{cite news|work=The Register|date=1997-07-23|url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~canbrnep/sarakeddywork.htm|last=Keddy|first=Sarah|title=Elusive Isle Haute captures scientists' imaginations|accessdate=2007-10-04}}</ref>
