The '''Lesser Antillean Macaw''' or '''Guadeloupe Macaw''' (''Ara guadeloupensis'') is a [[hypothetical extinct species]] of [[macaw]], which may have been [[endemic]] to the [[Lesser Antillean]] island of [[Guadeloupe]]. In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean Macaw are known from several contemporary accounts. In addition, a few contemporary illustrations are thought to depict the bird. It is therefore one of the best documented species of hypothetical extinct bird. [[Austin Hobart Clark]] named the species based on these accounts in 1905. A parrot ulna from the island of [[Marie-Galante]] was assigned to the species in 2001, but this identification has since been disputed. 

According to contemporary descriptions, the body was red, and the wings were red, blue and yellow. The tail feathers were 18 or 15<U+2013>20 in (45.7 or 38.1<U+2013>50.1 cm) long. Apart from the smaller size and all red colouration of the tail feathers, it resembled the [[Scarlet Macaw]] of tropical South America. It may therefore either have been a close relative of that species, or possibly captive specimens of it which had escaped on the island. The diet was fruit, including those of the poisonous [[Manchineel tree]]. It was monogamous, nested in trees, and laid two eggs twice a year. It was described as being abundant on Guadeloupe by early writers, but was becoming rare by 1760, and only survived in uninhabited areas. It is thought to have been eradicated due to hunting by humans, and perhaps by disease, shortly after.

The Lesser Antillean Macaw is one of thirteen extinct macaw species at times thought to have lived in the [[Caribbean islands]]. Many of these species are now considered dubious, only two are known from physical remains, and there are no extant endemic macaws there today. Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the mainland in both prehistoric and historic times, so it is impossible to know whether contemporary reports refer to imported or native species.

The Lesser Antillean Macaw is well-documented, in spite of the lack of any existing specimens, since it was mentioned and described by several contemporary writers.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> Parrots thought to be the Lesser Antillean Macaw were first mentioned by the Spanish historian [[Gonzalo Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Oviedo y Vald<U+00E9>s]] in 1553, referring to a 1496 account by [[Ferdinand Columbus]], who mentioned parrots as big as chickens on Guadeloupe.<ref name =Greenway>Greenway, J. C. 1967. Extinct and vanishing birds of the world. American Committee for International Wild Life Protection 13, New York.</ref> In 1774, [[Comte de Buffon]] also stated that [[Christopher Columbus]] himself had found macaws on Guadeloupe, which he called "Guacamayas". The first detailed description was by [[Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre]] in 1654 and 1676, who also illustrated the bird alongside other animals on Guadeloupe, and later in 1742 by [[Jean Baptiste Labat]].<ref name="Clark name"/> 

[[Austin Hobart Clark]] gave the Lesser Antillean Macaw its scientific name, ''Ara guadeloupensis'', in 1905, based on the contemporary accounts, but also cited a 1765 colour plate as perhaps showing this species. He noted that it was different from the superficially similar [[Scarlet Macaw]] (''Ara macao'') in several features, as well as from the [[Green-winged Macaw]] (''Ara chloropterus'') and the [[Cuban Macaw]] (''Ara tricolor'').<ref name="Clark name">{{Cite doi|10.2307/4070159}}</ref> The [[ornithologist]] [[James Greenway]] suggested the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could had been imported to the island from elsewhere by the natives, but this is impossible to prove.<ref name = Woods/> According to the [[palaeontologist]] [[Julian Hume]], its similarity to the Scarlet Macaw indicates that they are close relatives, and possibly that the Guadeloupe species was descended from the mainland macaw.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> 

A small parrot [[ulna]] found in the Folle Anse [[archaeological site]] on the adjacent island of [[Marie-Galante]] was assigned to the Lesser Antillean Macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and [[David Steadman]] in 2001.<ref name = Woods>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=M.

Its size and robustness was similar to ulnae of that species, and though it was worn, they identified what appeared to be a notch which is also present on ulnae of the ''[[Amazon parrot|Amazona]]'' genus, but not in ''[[Ara (genus)|Ara]]''. In the same paper, they doubted the validity of another hypothetical [[sympatric]] parrot, the [[Guadeloupe Amazon]] (''Amazona violacea''), arguing it was also probably identical to the Imperial Amazon.<ref name = Olson>{{cite journal|last= Olson|first= S.

===Extinct Caribbean macaws===
[[File:Edward's Dodo.jpg|thumb|left|"Edwards' Dodo", a 1626 painting by [[Roelant Savery]], possibly showing this macaw on the left, and a [[Martinique Macaw]] on the right]] 
Macaws are known to have been transported between the [[Caribbean islands]] and from mainland South America both in historic times by [[Europeans]] and natives, and prehistoric times by [[Paleoamericans]]. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the [[Bahamas]] in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether or not the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands mention distinct, endemic species, since they could had been escaped individuals or [[feral]] populations of foreign macaws of known species, that had been transported there.<ref name = Olson/> As many as thirteen extinct macaws have at times been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.3366/anh.2010.0016}}</ref> Only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban Macaw, is known from about nine museum skins and [[subfossils]], and the [[Saint Croix Macaw]] (''Ara autochthones''), is only known from subfossils.<ref name = Olson/> No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today, and they were likely all driven to extinction by humans, some in historic, and others in prehistoric times.<ref name = Woods/>

In addition to the two species known from remains, several hypothetical extinct macaws were only based on contemporary accounts, but are considered dubious today. Many of these were named by [[Walter Rothschild]] in the early 20th century, who had a tendency to name species based on little tangible evidence.<ref name = Fuller1987>{{cite book |title = Extinct Birds |pages = 233<U+2013>236 |first = E. |last = Fuller | year = 1987| publisher = Penguin Books (England) |isbn = 0-670-81787-2}}</ref> Apart from the Lesser Antillean Macaw, the [[Violet Macaw]] (''Anodorhynchus purpurascens'') was named for accounts of blue parrots also reported from Guadeloupe, the [[Red-headed Macaw]] (''Ara erythrocephala'') and the [[Jamaican Red Macaw]] (''Ara gossei'') were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, the [[Martinique Macaw]] (''Ara martinica'') was from [[Martinique island]], and the [[Dominican Green-and-yellow Macaw]] (''Ara atwoodi'') was supposed to come from [[Dominica island]].<ref name="Rothschild">{{Cite book

They suggested such a species could had been driven to extinction prior to the arrival of Europeans.<ref name = Olson/>

==Description==
This Lesser Antillean Macaw was described as being similar in colouration to the Scarlet Macaw, but with shorter tail feathers, as these were 18 or 15<U+2013>20 in (45.7 or 38.1<U+2013>50.1 cm) long.<ref>{{Cite doi|10.1111/j.1474-919X.1906.tb07813.x}}</ref> The tail feathers of the Scarlet Macaw are 2 ft (70 cm) long, and also differ by having blue tips, with the outer feathers being almost entirely blue. In spite of the tail feathers being shorter, it is not certain to determine whether the Lesser Antillean Macaw was smaller than the Scarlet Macaw overall, as the relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species.<ref name="Clark name"/> The tail feathers were longer than those of the Cuban Macaw, which were 12 in (290<U+2013>305 mm) long.<ref name = Woods/> 
[[File:Ara Rouge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Variety of the 1765 plate]] 
Du Tetre described the Lesser Antillean Macaw as follows in 1654:
{{Quotation|The Macaw is the largest of all the parrot tribe; for although the parrots of Guadeloupe are larger than all other parrots, both of the islands and of the main land, the Macaws are a third larger than they... The head, neck, underparts, and back are flame color. The wings are a mixture of yellow, azure, and scarlet. The tail is wholly red, and a foot and a half long.<ref name="Clark name"/>}}
[[File:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Scarlet Macaws, note the blue tail feathers]] 
Labat described the macaw in much the same way in 1742:
{{Quotation|The feathers of the head, neck, back and underparts are flame colour; the wings are of a mixture of blue, yellow and red; the tail, which is from fifteen to twenty inches in length is wholly red. The head and the beak are very large, and it walks gravely; it talks very well, if it is taught when young; its voice is strong and distinct; it is amiable and kind, and allows itself to be caressed...<ref name="Clark name"/>}}
Both authors noted the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and stressed that the parrot species of each Caribbean island was distinct, and could be distinguished from each other visually and vocally.<ref name="Clark name"/> According to Hume, this means that the birds described could not simply had been escaped South American macaws. Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tetre and Labat does not match the behaviour of macaws from South America.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/>

Apart from Du Tetre's crude 1667 drawing and Labat's 1722 derivative, a few contemporary paintings depict red macaws that may be this species. A colour plate from a 1765 book of natural history (no. 12, entitled "L'Ara Rouge") shows a red macaw that may be the Lesser Antillean Macaw. All the tail feathers are entirely red, and it has more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the Scarlet Macaw.<ref name="Clark name"/> Different copies of the plate differ in the nuances used, but are identical in pattern. The painting suggests that a specimen may have been present in Europe at the time. [[Linnaeus]] cited the plate in his 1766 description of the Scarlet Macaw, but his description does not match the bird shown. A 1626 painting by [[Roelant Savery]], which also includes a [[Dodo]], shows a red macaw that agrees with the Lesser Antillean Macaw in appearance. A second macaw on the painting has been identified as being the likewise hypothetical Martinique Macaw, but though many parrots were imported to Europe at the time from all over the world, it is impossible to determine the accuracy of such paintings today.<ref name="Extinct Birds">{{cite book

==Behaviour and ecology==
[[File:Guadeloupe Psittaciformes.Labat.jpg|thumb|upright|Labat's 1722 illustration of a Guadeloupe Amazon, a [[Guadeloupe Parakeet]], and a Lesser Antillean Macaw]] 
Du Tetre gave a detailed account of the behaviour of the Lesser Antillean Macaw in 1654:
{{Quotation|This bird lives on berries, and on the fruit of certain trees, but principally on the apples of the manchioneel (!), which is a powerful and caustic poison to other animals. It is the prettiest sight in the world to see ten or a dozen Macaws in a green tree. Their voice is loud and piercing, and they always cry when flying. If one imitates their cry, they stop short. They have a grave and dignified demeanor, and so far from being alarmed by many shots fired under a tree where they are perched, they gaze at their companions who fall dead to the ground without being disturbed at all, so that one may fire five or six times into the same tree without their appearing to be frightened.<ref name="Clark name"/>}}
[[File:Hippomane mancinella (fruit).jpg|thumb|left|Manchineel fruit]] 
In a 1667 work, Du Tetre gave a similar account, but also mentioned that the macaw only ate the [[poisonous]] [[Manchineel]] fruits in times of necessary, and went on to describe its reproductive behaviour:
{{Quotation|The male and the female are inseparable companions and it is rare that one is seen singly. When they wish to breed (which they do once or twice a year) they make a hole with their beaks in the stump of a large tree, and construct a nest with feathers from their own bodies. They lay two eggs, the size of those of a partridge (''Perdix cinerea''). The others of the parrot kind make their nests in the same way, but lay green eggs... The Macaws are much larger than the large parrots of Guadeloupe or Grenada, and live longer than a man; but they are almost all subject to a falling sickness.<ref name="Clark name"/>}}
The twice yearly breeding may actually have been staggered breeding, which is practised by some tropical birds.<ref name="Extinct Birds"/> Clark suggested that the Lesser Antillean Macaw also occurred on Dominica and Martinique, but there is no evidence for this. It may instead have existed on other islands that were closer to Guadeloupe.<ref name = Woods/>

==Extinction==
[[File:Ara guadeloupensis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Variety of the 1765 plate]] 
In 1534, the writer Johann Huttich mentioned that the forests were full of this macaw, which  was apparently as abundant as [[grasshoppers]], and was cooked together with [[Cannibalism|human flesh]] and that of other birds by the natives of Guadeloupe.<ref name="Huttich">{{Citation  | last =  Clark | first =  A. H. | author-link =   | title = Note on the Guadeloupe Macaw (''Ara Guadeloupensis'')  | journal = The Auk  | volume = 51  | issue = 3 | pages =   | date =   | year = 1934 }}</ref> In 1654, Du Tetre stated the flesh was tough, and that it was considered unpalatable by some, and even poisonous. He claimed he and the other inhabitants of the island often consumed it, and that he did not get ill effects from it. He also stated the natives wore the feathers as head decoration, and as moustaches through the [[septum]] of the nose. He described how it was hunted by the natives as follows:
{{Quotation|The natives make use of a stratagem to take them alive; they watch for a chance to find them on the ground, eating the fruit which has fallen from the trees, when they approach quietly under cover of the trees, then all at once run forward, clapping their hands and filling the air with cries capable not only of astounding the birds, but of terrifying the boldest. Then the poor birds, surprised and distracted, as if struck with thunderbolt, lose the use of their wings, and, making a virtue of necessity, throw themselves on their backs and assume defensive with the weapons nature has given them - their beaks and claws -  with which they defend themselves so bravely that not one of the natives dares to put his hand on them. One of the natives bring a big stick which he lays across the belly of the bird, who seizes it with beak and claws; but while he is occupied in biting it, the native ties him so adroitly to the stick that he can do with him anything he wishes...<ref name="Clark name"/>}}
Since Du Tetre mentioned the macaws were prone to sickness, an outbreak of a disease may have contributed to its demise, along with hunting.<ref name = Woods/> In 1760, [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] quoted a letter by M. de la Borde, which stated that macaws had become very rare in all the Antillean islands, because they were hunted for food. They could by then only be found in areas not frequented by man, and were probably extinct soon after. Parrots are often the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.<ref name="Clark name"/>
