'''Robert Foliot''' (died 1186) was a medieval [[Bishop of Hereford]] in England. He was a relative of a number of English ecclesiastics, including [[Gilbert Foliot]], one of his predecessors at Hereford. After serving [[Alexander of Lincoln|Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln]] as a clerk, he became a clerk of [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] and brother of King [[Stephen of England]]. He attended the [[Council of Reims]] in 1148, where another relative, [[Robert de Chesney]], was elected as Bishop of Hereford. Chesney then secured the office of [[Archdeacon of Oxford]] for Foliot. 

During the early 1160s, Foliot also served as a clerk for [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], but left the archbishop's service as Becket's dispute with the king began to intensify. He was elected to Hereford in 1173, and served as a royal and papal judge while bishop. Archeological evidence links the building of the Bishop's Palace at Hereford to his episcopate. After his death, Foliot was buried in [[Hereford Cathedral]].

==Early life==

Robert Foliot  was a relative of both [[Gilbert Foliot]], Bishop of Hereford and [[Bishop of London]], and of [[Robert de Chesney]], [[Bishop of Lincoln]].<ref name=BHOArchDOxford/ Another relative was Ralph Foliot, a royal justice.<ref name=Turner91>Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 91</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some sources name him the nephew of Gilbert,<ref name=Henryii535>Warren ''Henry II'' p. 525</ref> but others are unsure of the exact relationship.<ref name=BHOHereford/><ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} Robert Foliot's family appears to have been the branch of the [[Foliot family]] that owned the manor of [[Warpsgrove]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. This is made likely by Foliot's confirmation of a gift of land from Ralph Foliot of Warpsgrove to Ralph's son, and it is possible that Foliot was the brother or uncle of Ralph Foliot.<ref name=DNB>Barrow "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9793 Foliot, Robert (d. 1186)]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>

There is no evidence of Foliot's education, but he likely received an education in order to fit him for his career in the church. Bibliographers have frequently confused him with his predecessor as bishop, [[Robert of Melun]], so he has mistakenly been given as the author of a number of documents.<ref name=DNB/>

==Clerical career==

Foliot was a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] by 1147,<ref name=BHOLincPrebend>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33600 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Prebendaries: Langford Ecclesia]''</ref> and an official of [[Alexander of Lincoln]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]], who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot was sent to the [[Council of Reims]] in 1148 by the Lincoln [[cathedral chapter]] in order to learn [[Pope Eugene III]]'s wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. [[Henry of Blois]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]], was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope agreed with the chapter and appointed [[Robert de Chesney]] as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk.<ref name=DNB/> 

Foliot was later named [[Archdeacon of Oxford]] in the Lincoln diocese, sometime before 1 October 1151,<ref name=BHOArchDOxford/> owing the appointment to Chesney.<ref name=DNB/> He was also a canon of [[Hereford Cathedral]],<ref name=BHOArchDOxford>Greenway ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=33570 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 3: Lincoln: Archdeacons: Oxford]</ref> appearing in that capacity in 1173, but it is unclear when exactly he acquired the position. It is also unclear whether he owed this position to his relative Gilbert Foliot, who was bishop of Hereford from 1148 to 1163, or if he received the canonry after 1163 through royal influence.<ref name=DNB/> Foliot served as a clerk for [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]],<ref name=Becket78>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 78</ref> witnessing three documents for Becket during the period 1162<U+2013>1164.<ref name=Becket81>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' p. 81</ref>

During early days of Becket's dispute with the king, Foliot helped mediate between Becket and Gilbert Foliot, who was supporting the king.<ref name=DNB/> Robert Foliot was one of the first of Becket's clerks to leave the archbishop's service, asking permission to leave Becket's household shortly after the council at [[Clarendon]] in January 1164, which ratified the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]].<ref name=Becket100>Barlow ''Thomas Becket'' pp.98<U+2013>100</ref>

==Bishop of Hereford==

Foliot was elected to the [[see of Hereford]] in late April 1173 and consecrated on 6 October 1174<ref name=Handbook250>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 250</ref> at [[Canterbury]] by Archbishop [[Richard of Dover]].<ref name=BHOHereford/> Hereford had been vacant since the death of [[Robert of Melun]] in 1167, due to the Becket's exile and then death. Foliot was either elected by the cathedral chapter without guidance from the king,<ref name=HenryII534>Warren ''Henry II'' pp. 534<U+2013>535</ref> or was nominated to the cathedral chapter by King Henry at the urging of his relative Gilbert Foliot.<ref name=DNB/> Robert Foliot later attended the [[Third Lateran Council]] in 1179.<ref name=BHOHereford>Barrow ''[http://british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=34422 Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066<U+2013>1300: volume 8: Hereford: Bishops]</ref> While bishop, he became involved in a disupte with [[Hugh Parvus]], a local baron, over the power of appointment to two churches.<ref name=Roger95>Cheney ''Roger of Worcester'' p. 95</ref> He also served as a [[papal judge-delegate|judge-delegate]] for the papacy, serving with [[Roger of Worcester|Roger]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] on cases including one between a [[Norman people|Norman]] monastery and an English [[priory]].<ref name=Roger129>Cheney ''Roger of Worcester'' p. 129</ref> He judged a number of other cases for the papacy during his time as bishop.<ref name=Roger131>Cheney ''Roger of Worcester'' p. 131</ref><ref name=Roger142>Cheney ''Roger of Worcester'' p. 142</ref> He received over 40 surviving papal commissions and communications, some of which dealt with the problems of married clergy in his diocese. From his ecclesiastical documents, almost 40 survive.<ref name=DNB/>

While bishop, he gave books, altar furnishings, and land to his cathedral chapter, as well as a purple and gold cape to [[Wigmore Abbey]]. Although no documentary evidence links him to the timbered hall in the bishop's palace at Hereford, tree-ring dating of the timbers has dated its construction to 1179, during his time as bishop.<ref name=DNB/> He also gave money to the Bishop's Chapel in Hereford Cathedral.<ref name=Boker48>B<U+00F6>ker "Bishop's Chapel" ''Gesta'' p. 48</ref>

==Death and legacy==

Foliot died on 9 May 1186,<ref name=Handbook250/> and was buried in [[Hereford Cathedral]]. Copies of his correspondence survive at the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]].<ref name=DNB/>
