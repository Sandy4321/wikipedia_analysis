'''William "Red" Holzman''' ([[August 10]] [[1920]]&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;[[November 13]]  [[1998]]) was an [[NBA]] [[basketball]] player and [[coach (sport)|coach]] probably best known as the [[head coach]] of the [[New York Knicks]] from [[1967]] to [[1982]]. Holzman helped lead the Knicks to two [[NBA Finals|NBA Championship]]s in [[1970]] and [[1973]], and was elected into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[1985]].

== Early career ==
Born in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], [[New York]] in [[1920]], Holzman played basketball for Franklin K. Lane [[secondary school|High School]] in the mid-[[1930]]s. He attended the [[University of Baltimore]] and later the [[City College of New York]], where he played for two years until graduation in [[1942]]. Holzman joined the [[United States Navy]] in the same year, and played on the [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]] [[Naval Station Norfolk|Naval Base]] team for two years.

== Professional career ==
Holzman was discharged from the Navy in [[1945]] and subsequently joined the [[National Basketball League (United States)|NBL]] [[Rochester Royals]], which won the NBL championship in Holzman's first season. Holzman stayed with the team through their move to the NBA and subsequent NBA championship in [[1951]]. In [[1953]], Holzman left the Royals and joined the [[Milwaukee Hawks]] as a player-coach, eventually retiring as a player in [[1954]] but continuing as the team's head coach. During the [[1956]]&ndash;[[1957]] season, Holzman led the Hawks (then in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]) to 19 losses during their first 33 games, and was subsequently fired.

In 1957, Holzman became assistant coach of the [[New York Knicks]] for a stretch of ten years ending in [[1967]], whereupon he became the team's head coach for the most part until [[1982]]. (Holzman's former player, [[Willis Reed]], replaced him as Knick's head coach in [[1977]], but Holzman returned near the start of the [[1978]]&ndash;[[1979]] season.) During this 15-year span as Knicks' coach, Holzman won a total of 613 games, including two NBA championships in [[1970]] and [[1973]].

For his efforts leading up to the Knicks' 1970 championship win, Holzman was named the [[NBA Coach of the Year Award|NBA Coach of the Year]] for that year. He was one of very few players and coaches to have won an NBA championship as both player and coach. As a coach, his final record was 696 wins and 604 losses. In [[1985]], he was elected into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].

Following his lengthy NBA coaching career, Holzman was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] and died in [[New Hyde Park, New York]] in [[1998]].
