'''Joni Mitchell, [[Order of Canada|CC]]''' (born '''Roberta Joan Anderson''' on [[November 7]] [[1943]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[musician]], [[songwriter]], and [[painter]].[http://www.jonimitchell.com/biography/bio.cfm?id=230]

Mitchell's singing began in small nightclubs and [[busking]] on the streets of [[Toronto]] and in her native [[Western Canada]]. She subsequently became associated with the burgeoning [[folk music]] scene of the mid-1960s in [[New York City]]. Mitchell achieved fame in the late [[1960s]] and was considered a key part of the [[Southern California]] [[folk rock]] scene. Throughout the 1970s, she explored and combined the [[Pop music|pop]] and [[jazz]] genres. Mitchell has amassed a body of work that is highly respected by both critics and fellow musicians.<ref>In 2002, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine called Mitchell  "one of the greatest songwriters ever".  See: {{cite news |last=Wild |first=David |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=935 |title=Joni Mitchell |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>

Mitchell is also an accomplished [[Visual arts|visual artist]]. She has, through [[photography]] or [[painting]], created the artwork for each of her albums and, in 2000, in an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail, described herself as a "painter derailed by circumstance". A blunt critic of the music industry, Mitchell had stopped recording over the last several years, focusing mainly on her visual art, but in 2007 released ''[[Shine (Joni Mitchell album)|Shine]]'', her first album of new songs in nine years.

==Early life==
Joni Mitchell was born Roberta Joan Anderson on [[November 7]] [[1943]], in [[Fort Macleod]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], to Bill Anderson and Myrtle Anderson (n<U+00E9>e McKee). Her mother was a teacher, and her father a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] airman. During the war years, she moved with her parents to a number of bases in western Canada. After the war, her father began working as a grocer, and his work took the family to Saskatchewan to the towns of Maidstone and [[North Battleford]]. When she was 11, the family settled in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], which Mitchell considers her hometown.

At the age of nine, Mitchell contracted [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] during a Canadian [[epidemic]], but recovered after a stay in the hospital, during which she first became interested in singing.  She was hospitalized during the long Canadian winter, and remembered: <blockquote>"They said I might no[t] walk again, and that I would not be able to go home for Christmas.  I wouldn't go for it.  So I started to sing [[Christmas carols]] and I used to sing them real loud....The boy in the bed next to me, you know, used to complain. And I discovered I was a ham." <ref name= "crowe">{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Cameron |url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/eyes_ears/articles/crowe_jrl_joni_mitchell.html |title=Joni Mitchell |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1979-07-26 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref> </blockquote>  Mitchell also took up [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] at the same age, which may explain the unique texture to her voice. 

She began taking [[piano]] lessons at age seven, and immediately felt the creative instinct to write her own music. Meanwhile, she excelled at art in school. In grade 7 her English teacher, Mr. Kratzman, told her: "If you can paint with a brush, you can paint with words." As a teenager, she taught herself [[guitar]] and [[ukulele]] and began performing at parties. This eventually led to busking and gigs playing in [[coffeehouse]]s and other venues in Saskatoon. After finishing high school, she attended the [[Alberta College of Art and Design]] in [[Calgary]] for a year, but then left and returned to the coffeehouse scene.

As Mitchell prepared to leave her home in Saskatoon to relocate to Toronto, she became [[pregnancy|pregnant]]. Seeing no other alternatives, she gave her daughter, Kelly Dale Anderson (born [[February 19]] [[1965]]), up for [[adoption]]. The experience remained private for most of her career, but she made allusions to it in several songs, most notably the song "[[Little Green (song)|Little Green]]" (from ''Blue''), and, years later, the song "Chinese Cafe" from "Wild Things Run Fast" ("Your kids are coming up straight/My child's a stranger/I bore her/But I could not raise her"). Her daughter, renamed Kilauren Gibb, began a search for her as an adult, and the two were reunited in 1997. <ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Brian D |url=http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011323 |title=Joni Mitchell's Secret |publisher=Maclean's |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== 1960s folk singer ===
Mitchell took her surname from a brief marriage to folksinger Chuck Mitchell in 1965. She performed frequently in coffeehouses and [[folk clubs]] and, by this time creating her own material, became well known for her unique songwriting and her innovative guitar style. Personal and often self-consciously poetic, her songs were strengthened by her extraordinarily wide-ranging voice (with a range in pitch at one time covering over four [[octave]]s {{Fact|date=October 2007}}) and her striking [[guitar]] technique, which makes extensive use of alternative tunings.

While she was playing one night in "The Gaslight South" [http://www.jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1357], a club in [[Florida]], [[David Crosby]] walked in and was immediately struck by her ability and her appeal as an artist. He took her back to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where he set about introducing her and her music to his friends.

Much of her initial acclaim was as a result of other artists covering her songs. Her first songwriting credit to hit the charts, "Urge for Going," was a success for country singer [[George Hamilton IV]] and for folk singer [[Tom Rush]]; it also appeared many years later as a [[B-side]] by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] band [[Travis (band)|Travis]]. [[Ireland|Irish]] singer [[Luka Bloom]] also recorded the song to great effect, as has classical violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] with a gentle, lilting instrumental version.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}
Mitchell's own 1967 recording of the song was released on the flip side of the 1972 single "You Turn Me On I'm A Radio", but was not released on an album until the ''Hits'' compilation in 1996. In any version, "Urge for Going" was an audacious piece of songwriting, painting an extremely evocative picture of the oncoming of dread winter. Not surprisingly for someone from the Canadian prairies, Mitchell had a finely developed sense for the passings of seasons and comings of age, themes that would appear on her "The Circle Game", which [[Tom Rush]] recorded in 1968.

Mitchell's songwriting reached its highest visibility when [[Judy Collins]] had a top-ten hit in early 1968 with "[[Both Sides Now (song)|Both Sides Now]]". British [[folk rock]] group [[Fairport Convention]] included "Chelsea Morning" and "I Don't Know Where I Stand" on their debut album, recorded in late 1967, and the otherwise unreleased "Eastern Rain" on their second album the following year.

The songs on Mitchell's first two solo albums, ''[[Song to a Seagull]]'' (1968) and ''[[Clouds (album)|Clouds]]'' (1969), were archetypes of the nascent [[singer-songwriter]] movement of the time.

=== Early and mid-1970s chart success ===
Mitchell moved to [[California]] in late 1967. By the time of her third album, ''[[Ladies of the Canyon]]'' (1970), maturity brought a record infused with the spirit of California life (the canyon of the title refers to perhaps both Topanga Canyon and [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]) as well as containing her first major hit single, the environmentalist "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]", and "[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]", about the [[Woodstock Festival|music festival]], which was later a hit for both [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] and [[Matthews Southern Comfort]]. Mitchell wrote the song after missing and then hearing about [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]. She had cancelled her appearance at the festival on the advice of her manager for fear that she would miss a scheduled appearance on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' (and the fact that the only way she could get to Woodstock was by helicopter, the roads being impassible), and has since said the decision to miss the concert was one of the biggest regrets of her life. "For Free" is the first of Mitchell's many songs that underscore the dichotomy between the benefits of her stardom and its costs, both in terms of its pressure and of the loss of privacy and freedom it entails.
[[Image:Bluealbumcover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Blue (1971)]]
Mitchell's confessional approach deepened on ''[[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]]'' (1971), widely considered the best of this period, as well as a template for confessional songwriting.  Mitchell later said of the album, "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong."<ref name= "crowe">{{cite news |last=Crowe |first=Cameron |url=http://www.cameroncrowe.com/eyes_ears/articles/crowe_jrl_joni_mitchell.html |title=Joni Mitchell |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1979-07-26 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>  Exploring the various facets of relationships, from infatuation on "[[A Case of You]]" to insecurity on "This Flight Tonight", the songs featured an increasing use of [[Appalachian dulcimer]] on "[[Carey (song)|Carey]]" , "California", "All I Want", and "[[A Case of You]]" and piano (due in part to her admiration for [[Laura Nyro]]'s work).

Some of the piano-led songs featured the rhythms associated with [[Rock and roll|rock music]]. However, her Canadian past was not left behind: "[[River (song)|River]]" found her in warm climes at Christmastime, only to say, "I wish I had a river / I could skate away on."  In the 2000s "River" would be rediscovered by the plethora of all-Christmas-music holiday programming radio stations. Remakes of this song have been recorded by numerous artists including [[Aimee Mann]], [[Indigo Girls]], [[Robert Downey Jr.]], [[Allison Crowe]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Rachael Yamagata]], [[James Taylor]], and a duet by [[Madeleine Peyroux]] and [[k.d. lang]].

The more straightforward rock influence was still strong on her next two albums, recorded for new label Asylum. ''[[For the Roses]]'' (1972), whose title track continued her exploration of the themes of "For Free", sold well, supported by the country-influenced hit single "You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio". 

However, it was ''[[Court and Spark]]'' (1974), a hybrid of pop, rock, and folk with a jazzy sheen, that proved to be a huge success, producing such classic songs as "[[Free Man in Paris]]" (inspired by stories told by her manager, label founder and then-friend [[David Geffen]]), "[[Car On A Hill]]" and, most notably, "[[Help Me]]", which, to this day, remains her best selling single (it reached the top ten).''Court and Spark'' was also notable for the first echoes of the influence of jazz on Mitchell's work, and despite the commercial success of that album and the subsequent live record ''[[Miles of Aisles]]'', backed by the 70s pop-jazz outfit [[L.A. Express]], she spent the rest of the decade following that muse and creating more free-form, jazz-inflected music.

=== Mid to late 1970s jazz experimentation ===
Mitchell's 1975 album ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]'' was the first album to stylistically depart from the folk/pop foundation Mitchell had developed. It was also a lyrical departure, with the confessional style replaced by a series of vignettes, from mobsters and nightclub dancers ("Edith and the Kingpin") to the bored wives of the wealthy ("The Hissing of Summer Lawns" and "Harry's House/Centerpiece"). The album was stylistically diverse, with complex vocal harmonies set with African drumming (the [[Drum|Warrior Drums]] of [[Burundi]] making up the foundation of "The Jungle Line"). Although many fans and other artists often cite ''Hissing'' as their favourite Mitchell work, it was not well received at the time of its release. A common legend holds that ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine declared it the "Worst Album of the Year"; in truth it was called only the year's worst album ''title''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morrissey |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=309 |title=Melancholy Meets the Infinite Sadness |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1997-03-06 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>  (Mitchell and ''Rolling Stone'' have had a contentious relationship, initiated years earlier when RS featured a "tree" illustrating all of Mitchell's alleged romantic partners, primarily other musicians, which the singer said "hurt my feelings terribly at the time.")<ref name= "wild">{{cite news |last=Wild |first=David |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=935 |title=Joni Mitchell |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>

<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Hejira.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Hejira (1976)]] -->
During 1975 Mitchell also participated in several concerts in the [[Rolling Thunder Revue tours]] featuring [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joan Baez]], and in 1976, she performed as part of "[[The Last Waltz]]" by [[The Band]].

''[[Hejira (album)|Hejira]]'' (1976) continued Mitchell's trend toward jazz. The instrumentation is very intimate, usually consisting only of Mitchell's acoustic guitar, the electric guitar of [[Larry Carlton]], and [[Jaco Pastorius]]'s fretless [[bass guitar]] (on one track, Mitchell and Carlton reverse roles). The songs themselves, however, featured densely metaphorical lyrics and swooping vocal melodies providing contrast and counterpoint to the jazz rhythms of the arrangements. This album also highlighted as never before the unusual "open" guitar tunings that Mitchell used.  While ''Hejira'' "did not sell as briskly as [Mitchell's earlier] more accessible albums," its stature in her catalogue has grown over the years.<ref name= "ottawa">{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Doug |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=c5551bd3-2dea-4fc5-b5b8-81115aab7836&k=4978 |title=The trouble she's seen: Doug Fischer talks to Joni Mitchell about her seminal album, Hejira |publisher=The Ottawa Citizen |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>  Joni herself believes the album to be unique; in 2006, she said, "I suppose a lot of people could have written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on ''Hejira'' could only have come from me."<ref name= "ottawa">{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Doug |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=c5551bd3-2dea-4fc5-b5b8-81115aab7836&k=4978 |title=The trouble she's seen: Doug Fischer talks to Joni Mitchell about her seminal album, Hejira |publisher=The Ottawa Citizen |date=2006-10-08 |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

''[[Don Juan's Reckless Daughter]]'' (1977) was a further move towards the freedom and abstraction of jazz, a double album dominated by the lengthy part-improvised "Paprika Plains". The album received mixed reviews - its experimentation and originality were not generally expected of such a celebrated music star. The cover of the album created its own controversy; Mitchell was featured in several photographs on the cover, including one where she was disguised as a black man. 

Mitchell's next work was to be a collaboration with legendary bassist [[Charles Mingus]], who died before the project was completed in 1979. Mitchell finished the tracks with a band featuring Pastorius, [[Wayne Shorter]] and [[Herbie Hancock]] and the resulting free-form, sometimes [[arhythmic]] music was daring and eclectic. ''[[Mingus (album)|Mingus]]'' was poorly received; rock audiences were not receptive, and jazz purists were unimpressed. However, appreciation for this work has grown considerably over the years.

Mitchell released ''[[Shadows and Light]],'' a second live album that documented her recent tours, in 1980. The album contained some earlier hits, but focused on the late 1970s songs.

===1980s: the "Geffen era"===
The 1980s saw a reduced output of recordings compared to the previous decades. Only three albums of new material appeared on her new label (Geffen Records). 1982's ''[[Wild Things Run Fast]]'' marked a return to pop songwriting, including "Chinese Cafe/Unchained Melody" which incorporated the chorus and parts of the melody of the famous Righteous Brothers hit, and "(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care" - which charted higher than any Mitchell single since her 70s sales peak.

For ''[[Dog Eat Dog (album)|Dog Eat Dog]]'' (1985), British [[synth-pop]] performer and producer [[Thomas Dolby]] was brought on board.  Mitchell employed a host of modern sounds, courtesy of the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesizer.  Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented, "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record (by Geffen), and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems...He may be able to do it faster. He may be able to do it better, but the fact is that it then wouldn't really be my music."{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'' (1988) saw Mitchell collaborating with artists including [[Willie Nelson]], [[Billy Idol]], [[Wendy and Lisa]], [[Tom Petty]] and [[Don Henley]]. The songs spanned several genres, including a duet with [[Peter Gabriel]] on "My Secret Place".

After the release of ''Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm'', Mitchell participated in [[Roger Waters]]' [[The Wall Concert in Berlin]].

=== Turbulence and resurgence in the 1990s ===
[[Image:Joni Turbulent.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Turbulent Indigo (1994)]]
For her final Geffen album, 1991's ''[[Night Ride Home]]'', Mitchell presented what she described as a batch of "middle-aged love songs." Critically, it was better received than her 80s work and seemed to signal a move closer to her acoustic beginnings. But to many, the real return to form came with the [[Grammy]]-winning ''[[Turbulent Indigo]]'' (1994). "Indigo" was Mitchell's most simple, straightforward set of songs in years, mixing politics ("Sex Kills") with romance ("Sunny Sunday") to create "a startling comeback"<ref name= "Toronto">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=Alexandra |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=1575 |title=Joni Mitchell in person |publisher=Toronto Globe and Mail |date=2007-02-17 |accessdate=2007-03-11 |format = reprint}}</ref> that won two Grammy awards, including Best Pop Album. The recording of ''Turbulent Indigo'' saw the divorce of Mitchell and [[Larry Klein]], whose musical collaboration had lasted four albums (Mitchell has not since remarried).

Mitchell released her most recent set of 'original' new work with ''[[Taming the Tiger]]'' (1998).  She promoted "Tiger" with a return to regular concert appearances, most notably a co-headlining tour with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Van Morrison]].

It was around this time that critics began to notice a change in Mitchell's voice; the singer later admitted to feeling the same way, explaining that "I'd go to hit a note and there was nothing there."<ref name= "renai">{{cite news |last=Eggar |first=Robin |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=1569 |title=The Renaissance Woman |publisher=Sunday Times |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>  While her more limited range and huskier vocals have sometimes been attributed to her smoking (she has been described as "one of the world's last great smokers"), Mitchell believes the changes in her voice that became noticeable in the nineties were due to other problems, including vocal nodules, a compressed larynx, and the lingering effects of having had polio.<ref name= "renai">{{cite news |last=Eggar |first=Robin |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=1569 |title=The Renaissance Woman |publisher=Sunday Times |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>

=== "I hate music": the early 2000s ===
The singer's next two albums featured no new songs and, Mitchell has said, were recorded to "fulfill contractual obligations."<ref name= "Toronto">{{cite news |last=Gill |first=Alexandra |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=1575 |title=Joni Mitchell in person |publisher=Toronto Globe and Mail |date=2007-02-17 |accessdate=2007-03-11 |format = reprint}}</ref>  ''[[Both Sides Now]]'' (2000) was an album composed mostly of covers of [[jazz standard]]s, performed with an orchestra. It received mostly strong reviews and featured orchestral arrangements by [[Vince Mendoza]], who would collaborate with her again on ''[[Travelogue (Joni Mitchell album)|Travelogue]]'' and remains a strong seller.  The album contained reappraisals of "[[A Case of You]]" and the title track "Both Sides Now", two early hits transposed down to Mitchell's now-dusky, soulful alto range. Its success led to 2002's ''Travelogue'', a collection of re-workings of her previous songs with lush orchestral accompaniments. Mitchell had stated that this would be her final album.

[[Image:Joni-Mitchell Dreamland.png|thumb|200px|left|Dreamland (2004)]]
In a 2002 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Mitchell voiced her discontent with the current state of the music industry, describing it as a "cesspool."<ref name= "wild">{{cite news |last=Wild |first=David |url=http://jmdl.com/library/view.cfm?id=935 |title=Joni Mitchell |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |format = reprint}}</ref>  She expressed her dislike of the [[record industry]]'s dominance and her desire to control her own destiny, possibly through releasing her own music over the [[Internet]].

During the next few years, the only albums Mitchell released were compilations of her earlier work.  In 2003, Mitchell's Geffen recordings were collected in a four-disc box set, ''The Complete Geffen Recordings''. Included were remastered versions of all four albums, personal notes by Mitchell herself and three bonus tracks: a wordless vocal demo of what would become "Two Grey Rooms" (from ''[[Night Ride Home]]''), the basic piano demo for "Good Friends" (from ''[[Dog Eat Dog]]''), and an unreleased cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue."
A series of themed compilations of songs from earlier albums were also released: ''The Beginning of Survival'' (2004), ''[[Dreamland (Joni Mitchell album)|Dreamland]]'' (2004), and ''Songs of a Prairie Girl'' (2005), the last of which collected the threads of her Canadian upbringing and which she released after accepting an invitation to the [[Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Centennial]] concert in Saskatoon. The concert, which featured a tribute to Mitchell, was also attended by [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. In ''Prairie Girl'' liner notes, she writes that the collection is "my contribution to Saskatchewan's Centennial celebrations."

Although Mitchell stated that she would no longer tour or give concerts, she has made occasional public appearances to speak (for example) on environmental issues.[http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/05/05-04mitchell-audio.html]  Mitchell divides her time between her long-time home in [[Los Angeles]], and the 80-acre property in [[Sechelt]], British Columbia she's owned since the early '70s. "L.A. is my workplace", she said in 2006. "B.C. is my heartbeat."[http://jonimitchell.com/library/view.cfm?id=1460]. She focuses mainly on her visual art, which she does not sell and which she displays only on rare occasions.[http://jonimitchell.com/contact.cfm]

In summer 2007, Mitchell's official fan-run site confirmed speculation that she had signed a 2-record deal with [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] label.

Among the album's contributors were [[Norah Jones]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and Mitchell herself, who contributed a vocal to the re-recording of "The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)" (originally on her album ''[[Chalk Mark in a Rainstorm]]'').<ref>[http://www.herbiehancock.com/news/story.php?sid=59]</ref>

== Musical legacy ==
=== Unique guitar style ===
Almost every song she composed on the guitar uses an [[open tuning|open]], or non-standard, tuning; she has written songs in some 50 different tunings, which she has referred to as "Joni's weird chords". The use of alternative tunings allows more varied and complex harmonies to be produced on the guitar, without the need for difficult chord shapes. Indeed, many of Joni's guitar songs use very simple chord shapes, but her use of alternative tunings and a highly rhythmic picking/strumming style creates a rich and unique guitar sound. Her right-hand picking/strumming technique has evolved over the years from an initially intricate picking style, typified by the guitar songs on her first album, to a looser and more rhythmic style, sometimes incorporating percussive "slaps", that have been featured on later albums.

In 2003 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named her the 72nd greatest guitarist of all time; she was the highest-ranked woman on the list. [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time]

=== Influences on other artists ===
Mitchell could be labelled a "musician's musician"; her work has had an enormous influence on artists as disparate as [[Annie Lennox]], [[Jeff Buckley]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Tori Amos]], [[Maynard James Keenan]], [[Clannad]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], [[George Michael]], [[Conor Oberst]], [[Morrissey]], and [[KT Tunstall]].

For instance, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s song "The Ballad of [[Dorothy Parker]]" off the album ''[[Sign 'O' the Times (album)|Sign 'O' the Times]]'', pays tribute to Mitchell, both through his evocative Mitchell-like harmonies and through the use of one of Mitchell's own techniques: as in Mitchell's song "This Flight Tonight", Prince references a song in his lyrics (Joni's own "Help Me") as the music begins to emulate the chords and melody of that song. Another Joni reference left by Prince can also be seen on the back cover of his [[1981 in music|1981]] ''[[Controversy (album)|Controversy]]'' record - one of the headlines reads "<U+2605>JONI<U+2605>". [[Mandy Moore]] also expressed a huge admiration for Mitchell upon the release of her 2003 album ''[[Coverage (album)|Coverage]]'' on which she covered Mitchell's classic "Help Me".

A number of artists have had hits covering Mitchell's songs; most recently [[Sarah McLachlan]], who included her version of "River" on her 2006 Christmas album, ''[[Wintersong]]'' (a year after [[Aimee Mann]] covered the same song on her own 2005 Christmas EP). McLachlan also did a version of "Blue" years before. [[Amy Grant]] scored a hit in 1995 with a cover of "Big Yellow Taxi", as did The [[Counting Crows]] in 2002. Further to this, [[Janet Jackson]] used a sample of "Big Yellow Taxi" as the centerpiece of her 1997 single "[[Got 'Til It's Gone]]". Rap artists [[Kanye West]] and [[Mac Dre]] have also sampled Mitchell's vocals in their music. In 2004 singer [[George Michael]] covered her song "Edith And The Kingpin" for a radio show. [[Annie Lennox]] has covered "Ladies Of The Canyon" for the B-side of her 1995 hit "No More I Love You's". Other famous Mitchell covers include "Woodstock" by both [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] and [[Matthews Southern Comfort]], "This Flight Tonight" by [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], "Both Sides Now" by [[Judy Collins]], [[Clannad]], [[Paul Young]] and [[Roger Whittaker]], "Woodstock" by [[Eva Cassidy]] and "A Case Of You" by [[Tori Amos]], [[Jane Monheit]], [[Prince]], and [[Diana Krall]].

Although Mitchell usually refrains from commenting on other artists, particularly ones that she influences, she has expressed satisfaction with the work of two jazz-based artists who have interpreted her songs, [[Cassandra Wilson]] and [[Diana Krall]]. Although most listeners tend to remember Mitchell's earlier, more commercially popular work, many musicians have found inspiration in her more experimental work, particularly ''[[The Hissing of Summer Lawns]]'' and ''[[Hejira (song)|Hejira]]''. 

[[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Going to California]]" was said to be written about [[Robert Plant]] and [[Jimmy Page]]'s infatuation with Mitchell, a claim that seems to be borne out by the fact that, in live performances, Plant often says "Joni" after the line "To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries and sings".  Jimmy Page uses a double drop D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. 

[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] has cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell.  I knew every word to [[Court and Spark]]; I worshiped her when I was in high school.  [[Blue (Joni Mitchell album)|Blue]] is amazing.  I would have to say of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hirshey |first=Gerri |title=The Women In Rock Interviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1997-11-13}}</ref>

In 2007, [[Nonesuch Records]] released ''[[A Tribute to Joni Mitchell]]'', a CD featuring [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Brad Mehldau]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[k.d. Lang]] and [[James Taylor]]. Some of the recordings were made in the late 1990s when a project entitled 'A Case Of Joni' was developed, although never released. Among those who recorded tracks for the first tribute album, and remain unreleased were [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Sheryl Crow]].

==Awards and honours==
Mitchell was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997.  In 1995, she received Billboard's Century Award. In 1996 she was awarded the [[Polar Music Prize]]. 

She has received five regular [[Grammy Award]]s during her career, with the first coming in 1969 and the most recent in 2000. She received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2002, with the citation describing her as "one of the most important female recording artists of the rock era" and "a powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity."

Her home country Canada has bestowed a number of honours on Mitchell. She was inducted into the [[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]] in 1981, and into  [http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_joni_mitchell.xml.htm Canada's Walk of Fame] in 2001. In 2002 she became only the third popular Canadian singer/songwriter ([[Gordon Lightfoot]] and [[Leonard Cohen]] being the other two), to be appointed a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]]. She received an [[honorary doctorate]] in music from [[McGill University]] in 2004, and, in January 2007, she was inducted into the [[Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. On June 29, 2007, [[Canada Post]] featured Mitchell on a postage stamp. <ref> [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/06/12/stamps-stars.html Stamps honour iconic Canadian music stars] </ref>

In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked her #60 on their list of the [http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty/ 100 Greatest Artists of All Time]. The album ''Blue'' was listed by ''Time'' magazine as among the "All-Time 100 Albums" in November 2006.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |url=http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/0,27693,Blue,00.html |title=The All-TIME 100 Albums: Blue |publisher=Time |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>
