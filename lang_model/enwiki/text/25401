'''Domnall mac Taidc U<U+00ED> Briain''' (died 1115), also known as '''Domnall Ua Briain''', '''Domhnall Ua Briain''', and '''Domhnall mac Taidhg''', was the ruler of the [[Kingdom of the Isles]], the [[Kingdom of Thomond]], and perhaps [[Kingdom of Dublin]] as well. His father was Tadc, son of [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster]], which meant that Domnall was an a member of the Meic Taidc, a branch of the [[U<U+00ED> Briain]]. Domnall's mother was M<U+00F3>r, daughter of [[Echmarcach mac Ragnaill|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles]], which may have given Domnall a stake in Meic Ragnaill claims to the [[Kingdom of the Isles]].

In 1094, Domnall's uncle, [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland]], drove [[Godred Crovan|Gofraid Crob<U+00E1>n, King of Dublin and the Isles]] from Dublin, and may have replaced him with Domnall himself. Certainly at some point following Gofraid's death in 1095, Muirchertach installed Domnall as [[Rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Isles]]. The latter's reign was short-lived however, and Domnall appears to have been forced from the Isles prior to its subsequent conquest by the [[King of Norway]].

In 1111, Domnall evidently seized the kingship of the Isles by force. It is uncertain whether he enjoyed U<U+00ED> Briain support in this venture. Several years later, at a time when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Whilst he may have openly left to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]]. It is possible that he was survived by two sons.

Domnall was a son of Tadc, son of [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster]] (died 1086).<ref>[[#C2|Candon (2006)]] p. 117; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 104&ndash;105, 105 n. 59.</ref> Domnall was, therefore, a member of the Meic Taidc.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 104&ndash;105, 105 n. 59.</ref> According to ''[[Banshenchas]]'', Domnall's father married M<U+00F3>r, daughter of [[Echmarcach mac Ragnaill|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles]] (died 1064 or 1065), a member of the Meic Ragnaill. This source specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter: Amla<U+00ED>b (died 1096), B<U+00E9> Binn, Donnchad (died 1113), and Domnall himself.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 105, 105 n. 59; [[#D3|Dobbs (1931)]] p. 196.</ref>

==U<U+00ED> Briain intervention in Dublin==

Toirdelbach Ua Briain died in 1086, and the Kingdom of Munster was partitioned between his three surviving sons: Muirchertach (died 1119), Diarmait (died 1118), and Tadc (died 1086). The latter expired only a month after his father, after which Muirchertach drove Diarmait from Munster altogether, seizing the kingship for himself. Muirchertach then embarked upon extending his authority throughout Ireland.<ref>[[#D6|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> During this period, Muirchertach not only had to contend with the opposing forces of his surviving brother,<ref>[[#D6|Duffy (2005)]]; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 104&ndash;105.</ref> but also those of the Meic Taidc, the sons of his deceased brother. In 1091, however, the Meic Taidc appear to have come to terms with Muirchertach&mdash;at least temporarily&mdash;as the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]'' reports that a peace was agreed between him and the Meic Taidc. That being said, however, the annal-entry also notes that the latter acted treacherously towards Muirchertach's men.<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1091.10; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1091.10; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 105, 105 n. 58.</ref> Although Muirchertach appears to have regained control of the Kingdom of Dublin by 1090,<ref>[[#D6|Duffy (2005)]].</ref> he soon after lost it to [[Godred Crovan|Gofraid Crob<U+00E1>n, King of the Isles]] (died 1095), until he forced the latter from [[King of Dublin|kingship of Dublin]] once and for all in 1094.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 106&ndash;108.</ref> It may have been at this point that Muirchertach installed his son, [[Domnall Gerrl<U+00E1>mhach]] (died 1135), to the kingship.<ref>[[#F1|Flanagan (2008)]] p. 907.</ref> Another possibility, however, is that Muirchertach instead appointed Domnall himself after Gofraid's expulsion.<ref>[[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]].</ref>

==Meic Taidc interference in the Isles==

The year after Gofraid's expulsion from Dublin he died in the Hebrides.<ref>[[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 63; [[#D5|Duffy (2004b)]].</ref> Whether this is evidence that he had been driven from Mann is uncertain.<ref>[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 235; [[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 20; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16.</ref> According to the ''[[Chronicle of Mann]]'', Gofraid was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Lagmann mac Gofraid|Lagmann]],<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 116; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 98; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref> who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#D2|Duffy (2004b)]].</ref> At some point, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach, and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann's younger brother, [[Olafr Godredsson|Amla<U+00ED>b mac Gofraid]] (died 1153), was old enough to assume control.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#D10|Duffy (2009)]] p. 296; [[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] pp. 62&ndash;63; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 235&ndash;236; [[#P2|Power (2005)]] pp. 11&ndash;12; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]]; [[#O4|<U+00D3> Cu<U+00ED>v (1994)]] p. 116; [[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 108&ndash;110; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 115; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 100; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref> The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself, it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amla<U+00ED>b mac Gofraid upon the throne.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 235&ndash;236.</ref> Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Connacht|Connacht]], Leinster, [[Kingdom of Meath|Mide]], and Dublin.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#F1|Flanagan (2008)]] p. 909; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 235; [[#B1|Bracken (2004)]].</ref> In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chronicle&mdash;that Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kin&mdash;may well have been a condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves.<ref>[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 235&ndash;236; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 100&ndash;101; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref> Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 48; [[#D10|Duffy (2009)]] p. 296; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#P2|Power (2005)]] pp. 11&ndash;12; [[#B1|Bracken (2004a)]]; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 108&ndash;110; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 100&ndash;101; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref>

Although Domnall had earlier opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal Meic Ragnaill descent from Echmarcach.<ref name="echmarcach1">[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 109.</ref> In fact, the ''Annals of Ulster'' reveal that at least two apparent members of the Meic Ragnaill were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann.<ref>[[#T5|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2012)]] <U+00A7> 1087.7; [[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 32; [[#T4|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1087.7; [[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 62; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] pp. 233, 236; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 105, 109.</ref> As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading representative of Meic Ragnaill claims in the region.<ref name="echmarcach1"/> In 1096, the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' reveals that Domnall's brother, Amla<U+00ED>b, lost his life on Mann,<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1096.8; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1096.8; [[#O5|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2010)]] p. 225; [[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 64; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#P2|Power (2005)]] pp. 11&ndash;12; [[#D1|Duffy (1992)]] p. 109; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 99.</ref> apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles.<ref>[[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 64.</ref> This source not only corroborates U<U+00ED> Briain intervention in the Isles,<ref>[[#D3|Duffy (1993)]] p. 16.</ref> but suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents.<ref>[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236.</ref> The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.<ref>[[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 62; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#P2|Power (2005)]] pp. 11&ndash;12; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 115; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 101; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref>

==Norwegian ascendancy in Dublin and the Isles==

[[File:Kong-magnus-berrfott-menn.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Nineteenth-century depiction of Magn<U+00FA>s' forces in Ireland.]]

The extent of Domnall's rule in the kingdom is unknown, and it is questionable whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann.<ref name="F91-236">[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236.</ref> In about 1097, [[Magnus Barefoot|Magn<U+00FA>s <U+00D3>l<U+00E1>fsson, King of Norway]] (died 1105) sent a delegate named [[Ingemund|Ingimundr]] into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself on [[Lewis]], Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship.<ref name="ingimundr">[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] pp. 115&ndash;116.</ref> Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon [[Lewis and Harris|an island]] on the edge of the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself.<ref>[[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 116.</ref> In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year,<ref>[[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 236; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] pp. 118&ndash;119; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] pp. 101&ndash;102; [[#M3|Munch; Goss (1874)]] pp. 56&ndash;57.</ref> and the twelfth-century chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magn<U+00FA>s appeared on the scene.<ref>[[#P2|Power (2005)]] p. 13; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 119; [[#F2|Forester (1854)]] p. 217; [[#L1|Le Prevost (1852)]] p. 29.</ref> The warring itself may have been related to the struggles between Gofraid's sons,<ref>[[#P1|Power (1986)]] pp. 118&ndash;119.</ref> and the fact that the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during this conflict may be evidence that he had lost control of Mann by then.<ref name="F91-236"/>

==Restoration in the Isles; death in Ireland==

In 1111, according to the ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]'', Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force.<ref>[[#A5|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1111.5; [[#O5|<U+00D3> Corr<U+00E1>in (2010)]] p. 225; [[#D10|Duffy (2009)]] p. 296; [[#A4|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1111.5; [[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 64; [[#H1|Hudson (2005b)]] p. 5; [[#M1|McLeod (2002)]] p. 30; [[#E1|Etchingham (2001)]] p. 151; [[#O4|<U+00D3> Cu<U+00ED>v (1994)]] p. 116; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 116; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 143.</ref>{{#tag:ref|A seemingly unlikely claim, preserved by ''[[An Leabhar Muimhneach]]'', alleges that Domnall not only conquered the Isles during his career but also [[Lordship of Galloway|Galloway]].<ref>[[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 64; [[#D9|Duffy (1999)]] p. 355, 355 n. 62.</ref>|group=note}} In fact, this annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, the fact that the chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found U<U+00ED> Briain dominance in the region, before Magn<U+00FA>s' arrival in the Isles, and at about the same time as Amla<U+00ED>b's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 109 n. 78.</ref>

There is uncertainty as to whether Domnall was supported in his venture by the rest of the U<U+00ED> Briain. Although it is possible that he had backing from Muirchertach himself,<ref>[[#H1|Hudson (2005b)]] p. 5; [[#C1|Candon (2000)]].</ref> the fact that the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach's consent.<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1107.9; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1107.9; [[#E1|Etchingham (2001)]] p. 151; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref> The aforesaid annal-entry concerning Domnall's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland,<ref>[[#A5|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1111.5; [[#A4|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1111.5; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 143.</ref> and a further entry preserved by the same sources shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach within a year of Domnall's campaign.<ref>[[#A5|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1111.8; [[#A4|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1111.8; [[#E1|Etchingham (2001)]] p. 151; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref> These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach's northern opponents, and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall's campaign, and deny him any support from the Dubliners.<ref>[[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref> In fact, Domnall may well have been supported in the Isles by [[Domnall Ua Lochlainn|Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cen<U+00E9>l nE<U+00F3>gain]] (died 1121),<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 51.</ref> not only Muirchertach's principal rival, but the representative of [[Cen<U+00E9>l nE<U+00F3>gain|a family]] with a long history of involvement in the region.<ref>[[#O1|Oram (2011)]] p. 51; [[#F91|Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005)]] p. 239.</ref>

Not long after his intrusion into the Isles&mdash;perhaps in 1113<ref name="H1-5">[[#H1|Hudson (2005b)]] p. 5.</ref> or 1114<ref>[[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53.</ref>&mdash;Domnall appears to have been either driven out by force,<ref name="H1-5"/> or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health.<ref>[[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] pp. 114&ndash;115.</ref> In fact, this would appear to have been about the point when Amla<U+00ED>b mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles.<ref>[[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 191 n. 20.</ref> The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of [[Henry I of England|Henry I, King of England]] (died 1135),<ref>[[#D7|Duffy (2006b)]] p. 64; [[#H1|Hudson (2005b)]] p. 202; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 115.</ref> may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles,<ref>[[#H1|Hudson (2005b)]] p. 5; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 115.</ref> and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure.<ref name="H1-5"/> Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair|Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht]] (died 1156), as the ''Annals of Inisfallen'', the ''[[Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>]]'', the ''Annals of the Four Masters'', and the ''Annals of Ulster'', all report Domnall's death at the hands of the [[Connachta]] in 1115.<ref>[[#A2|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013a)]] <U+00A7> 1115.6; [[#A3|''Annals of the Four Masters'' (2013b)]] <U+00A7> 1115.6; [[#A8|''Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1115.5; [[#T5|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2012)]] <U+00A7> 1115.5; [[#A5|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1115.9; [[#A4|''Annals of Inisfallen'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1115.9; [[#T4|''The Annals of Ulster'' (2008)]] <U+00A7> 1115.5; [[#A7|''Annals of Loch C<U+00E9>'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1115.9; [[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53; [[#D2|Duffy (1992)]] p. 115; [[#P1|Power (1986)]] p. 116; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 143, 143 n. 2.</ref> In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year,<ref>[[#D8|Duffy (2006a)]] p. 72; [[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53.</ref> and the ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' elaborates that he installed Domnall as [[King of Thomond]] at this point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who had him eliminated.<ref>[[#T3|''The Annals of Tigernach'' (2010)]] <U+00A7> 1115.2; [[#A6|''Annals of Tigernach'' (2005)]] <U+00A7> 1115.2; [[#O2|Oram (2000)]] p. 53; [[#A1|Anderson (1922)]] p. 143, 143 n. 2.</ref>

Although two later members of the U<U+00ED> Briain&mdash;Conchobar mac Domnaill U<U+00ED> Briain, King of Ormond (blinded 1128), and Lughaid mac Domnaill U<U+00ED> Briain (died 1151)&mdash;appear to have been sons of Domnall's aforesaid first cousin, Domnall Gerrl<U+00E1>mhach, it is possible they were instead descendants of Domnall himself.<ref>[[#K1|Kelleher (1988)]] p. 23 n. 4.</ref>
