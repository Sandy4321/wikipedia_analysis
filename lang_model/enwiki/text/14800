==Design and development==
The TAI H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> Development Program started with an agreement signed between Turkish Undersecretariat for Defense Industries (Savunma Sanayii M<U+00FC>ste<U+015F>arl<U+0131><U+011F><U+0131> (SSM)) and TAI in March 2006. Under the agreement the company will design, manufacture and complete the civil certification the aircraft to [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] CS 23 standards.<ref name="TAIProg">{{cite web|url = http://www.tai.com.tr/prog.aspx?contentDefID=6|title = Turkish Primary and Basic Trainer Aircraft - Hurkis|accessdate = 22 August 2010|last = [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>

By June 2012 the H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> program had consumed one million man-hours with the work of 140 engineers. About a quarter of the Turkish engineers who have worked on H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> are female, as well as two of the three project heads.<ref name="youtube1">{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wyKmAnVTLo&feature=player_embedded#! |title=H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F>'un kad<U+0131>n m<U+00FC>hendisleri |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-07-15 |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref><ref name="milliyet1">{{cite web|url=http://ekonomi.milliyet.com.tr/ilk-yerli-ucak-hurkus-1-milyon-saatte-tasarlandi/ekonomi/ekonomidetay/27.06.2012/1559652/default.htm |title=Milliyet - <U+0130>lk yerli u<U+00E7>ak H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> 1 milyon saatte tasarland<U+0131> |publisher=Ekonomi.milliyet.com.tr |date=2012-06-27 |accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kokpit.aero/H%C3%BCrku%C5%9Fun%20kad%C4%B1n%20m%C3%BChendisleri?filter_name=h%C3%BCrku%C5%9F |title=H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F>'un kad<U+0131>n m<U+00FC>hendisleri |publisher=Kokpit.aero |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

The H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> will be equipped for day and night flying as well as basic pilot training, instrument flying, navigation training, weapons and formation training. The aircraft will have good visibility from both cockpits with a 50 degree down-view angle from the rear cockpit, [[cabin pressurization]] (nominal 4.16 psid), [[Martin-Baker]] Mk T-16 N 0/0 [[ejection seat]]s, an on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), an Environmental Control System (Vapor Cycle Cooling), an anti-G system, high shock absorbing [[landing gear]] for training missions, and Hands On Throttle and Stick (HOTAS).<ref name="TAIparis" /><ref name="TAIProg" /> [[Microtecnica]] of [[Turin, Italy]] has been selected to provide the aircraft's environmental control system.<ref name="FlightGlobal040610">{{cite web|url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/06/04/342815/microtecnica-selected-to-equip-turkeys-hurkus-trainer.html|title = Microtecnica selected to equip Turkey's Hurkus trainer|accessdate = 22 August 2010|last = Hoyle|first = Craig|authorlink = |date=June 2010}}</ref> The H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> has been designed for a 35-year [[service life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=tS-kl61663s |title=T<U+00FC>rkiye'nin u<U+00E7>a<U+011F><U+0131> H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>
  
The H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> development program has been subject to delays. In 2007 it was forecast that the first prototype would fly in late-2009 with first delivery, upon completion of the certification process, forecast for 2011. On 27 June 2012, the H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F> was officially rolled out at a ceremony held at TAI's Kazan premises. The forecast date for the first flight was then delayed until later in 2012<ref name="TAIparis" /> and actually occurred on 29 August 2013 when the aircraft flew from the Ankara Ak<U+0131>nc<U+0131> Air Base on a 33-minute flight.<ref name="autogenerated1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tai.com.tr/en/basin-bultenleri/turkish-primary-and-basic-trainer-hurkus-was-rolled-out |title=Turkish Primary and Basic Trainer "H<U+00FC>rku<U+015F>" Rolls Out - Turkish Aerospace Industries, Inc |publisher=Tai.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/gundem_hurkus-ilk-ucusunu-yapti_2126251.html |title=H<U+00DC>RKU<U+015E>, ilk u<U+00E7>u<U+015F>unu yapt<U+0131> |publisher=ZAMAN |date= |accessdate=2013-08-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Niles |first=Russ |url=http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/Turkish-Hurkus-Military-Trainer-Flies220521-1.html |title=Turkish Hurkus Military Trainer Flies - AVweb flash Article |publisher=Avweb |date=2013-08-29 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>
