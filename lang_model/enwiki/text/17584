[[FBI Special Agent]] '''Fox William Mulder''' is a [[fictional character]] and one of the two [[protagonist]]s of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. Mulder's peers consider his (often correct) theories on extraterrestrial activity as spooky and far-fetched. He also has a [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]]. With his FBI partner [[Dana Scully]], he works in the [[x-file|X-Files]] office, which is concerned with cases with particularly mysterious or possibly paranormal circumstances that were left unsolved and shelved by the FBI. Fox Mulder is played by [[David Duchovny]]. Mulder was a main character for the first [[The X-Files (season 7)|seven seasons]], but was limited to a [[recurring character]] for the last two seasons.

Mulder made his first appearance in the [[The X-Files (season 1)|first season]] [[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot episode]], broadcast in 1993. Mulder believes in extraterrestrial [[unidentified flying objects]] (UFOs) and a [[conspiracy theory|government conspiracy]] to hide or deny the truth of their existence. Mulder considers the [[X-File]]s and the truth behind the supposed conspiracy so important that he has made them the main focus of his life.

==Character arc==

The mysterious disappearance of Mulder's [[Samantha Mulder|sister]] and his ensuing search for her became the consuming drive of his life.<ref name="Dreamland">{{cite episode| episodelink=Dreamland (The X-Files) | title=Dreamland | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] & [[Michael Watkins]] | writers = [[Vince Gilligan]], John Shiban & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 4 & 5}}</ref> In 1982, Mulder graduated with first class honours from [[University of Oxford]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[psychology]].

In 1988, the FBI assigned Mulder to the Violent Crimes Unit.<ref name="Kill_Switch"/> Around this time, Mulder first came across the [[X-File]]s, an obscure FBI section dealing with cases relating to the paranormal; he pored over these cases in his spare time, becoming obsessed with them.<ref name="Pilot"/> In 1991, Mulder re-opened the X-Files with [[Special Agent]] [[Diana Fowley]], but Fowley left shortly thereafter.<ref name="The_End">{{cite episode| episodelink=The End (The X-Files) | title=The End | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.

Mulder's ultimate goal was to uncover what he believed to be a [[conspiracy (political)|government conspiracy]] to hide the truth about alien life, and to find out what had happened to his sister.<ref name="Pilot"/> His quest and belief in the existence of aliens was, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or [[Story arc|mytharc]]. However, during a period of time after Scully's cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by [[List of The X-Files characters#Michael Kritschgau|Michael Kritschgau]] that aliens did not in fact exist, and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a smokescreen, to justify military activities and toy with him.<ref name="Gethsemane">{{cite episode| episodelink= Gethsemane (The X-Files) | title= Gethsemane | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.

During the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season]], Mulder eventually discovers the truth about his sister. Samantha was abducted (either by the alien colonists or the government conspirators), and various tests were performed on her. She was then returned to [[The Smoking Man]] to live out her life under his supervision, all the while undergoing additional tests. She was unable to bear the testing any longer so she ran away from her home and was eventually admitted to a nearby hospital, where she disappeared from her locked room. It is revealed that Samantha was taken by "spiritual intervention", with the help of beings called "[[Walk-ins]]". Mulder is briefly reunited with Samantha's spirit.<ref name="Closure">{{cite episode| episodelink=Closure (The X-Files) | title=Closure | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 7 | number = 11}}</ref>

Mulder was also abducted by the aliens himself in 2000, and returned to Earth, almost dead, a few months later.<ref name="Requiem">{{cite episode| episodelink=Requiem (The X-Files) | title=Requiem | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 7 | number = 22}}</ref> He had been infected by an [[Black oil|alien virus]] (for the second time), but Scully found a way to rescue him.<ref name="Deadalive">{{cite episode| episodelink=Deadalive | title=Deadalive | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Tony Wharmby]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 8  | number = 15}}</ref> After Mulder returned home to his apartment, an application was submitted to the FBI for his reinstatement to the X-files but this was declined by [[Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|Deputy Director]] [[Alvin Kersh]], who had been promoted in charge of the X-Files shortly after Mulder had been abducted.

After about a year in hiding, Mulder obtains crucial information from [[Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center|a secret facility]] about the date of the planned alien colonization effort, but is caught and put on trial for the murder of [[List of The X-Files characters#Knowle Rohrer|Knowle Rohrer]]. Despite a defense organized by [[Walter Skinner]] with numerous witnesses, the judges sentence Mulder to [[death penalty|death]]. With help from several people, including a reformed Kersh and the ghost of [[Alex Krycek]], Mulder breaks out of prison and escapes with Scully. As of the [[The Truth (The X-Files)|series finale]], Mulder and Scully were on the run.<ref name="The_Truth">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Truth (The X-Files) | title=The Truth | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 9  | number = 19 & 20}}</ref> Six years after the events of the ninth season, Fox Mulder's fugitive status is clear. Scully mentions that he is wanted by the FBI and dialogue also shows that the FBI does not really want to find him and is simply happy to have him "out of their hair". He is called to assist with the investigation of a missing FBI agent. In exchange for his help, all charges against him are dropped.<ref name="I_Want_to_Believe">{{cite episode| episodelink=The X-Files: I Want to Believe | title=I Want to Believe | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season =  | number = 2}}</ref>

Despite his aloofness and cynical sense of humor, Mulder displays unbridled enthusiasm and interest when it comes to the paranormal, especially because of his personal involvement after his [[Samantha Mulder|sister's abduction]].<ref name="Pilot"/> [[Walter Skinner]] and other FBI officials have become concerned by his unprofessional behavior. This only proves true as Mulder makes a habit of letting his personal feelings cloud his judgment; his emotional attachment to UFO cases becomes more severe throughout the series, because of [[Dana Scully]]'s eventual abduction and resultant [[cancer]] as well as his sister's abduction.<ref name="Closure"/> Mulder can lose his temper when Scully is involved; on multiple occasions, he has become violent in his grief and unreserved in threatening physical force.<ref name="Emily">{{cite episode| episodelink=Emily (The X-Files) | title=Emily | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Vince Gilligan]], John Shiban & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 5  | number = 7}}</ref> Mulder's overprotectiveness of Scully stems not only from his obvious devotion and love for her, but also a long-harbored guilt; Mulder has admitted feeling indirectly responsible for the ordeals and tragedies Scully had gone through because of their investigations.

In the episode "[[Drive (The X-Files)|Drive]]", Mulder facetiously apologizes on behalf of the "international Jewish conspiracy" in response to the abusive and [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] tirades of a suspect, to which Mulder appears to take offense; the suspect also guesses Mulder's ethnicity is Jewish based on [[Mulder|his last name]].<ref name="Drive">{{cite episode| episodelink=Drive (The X-Files) | title=Drive | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] | writers = [[Vince Gilligan]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6  | number = 2}}</ref> Despite this, in the episode "Kaddish", Mulder is unable to identify a [[Talmud]]ic book, states that he does not know [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and quips that [[Jesus]] returned from the dead.<ref name="Kaddish">{{cite episode| episodelink=Kaddish (The X-Files) | title=Kaddish | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Howard Gordon]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 4  | number = 15}}</ref> Also, Mulder, as his father before him,<ref name="The_Blessing_Way">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Blessing Way (The X-Files) | title=The Blessing Way | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W.

[[David Duchovny]] suggested Mulder is [[Jew]]ish when interviewed during production of the second season.<ref>''"The Truth Is Out There: The Official Guide to the X-Files Vol. 1"'', by Brian Lowry, Chris Carter. Harper Paperbacks, 1995.</ref> In the episode "The Field Where I Died", Mulder went into a hypnotic trance and recalls a past life, where he is in a concentration camp during the Holocaust.

Mulder is almost never seen sleeping in a bed. The bedroom in his apartment (which appeared as late as the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the show's run) is apparently used for storage and is filled floor to ceiling with junk, including a couple of boxes of [[Porn|pornographic magazines]].<ref name="Dreamland"/> Instead, Mulder sleeps on his couch, often falling asleep to a blaring television. Mulder can seem to go through manic periods when worried or working on a case, contributing to or exacerbating his [[insomnia|insomniac tendencies]].<ref name="Tooms">{{cite episode| episodelink=Tooms | title=Tooms | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[David Nutter]] | writers = [[Glen Morgan]] & [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 1 | number = 21}}</ref> Since "[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland II]]" where a 'man In Black' body-swaps with Mulder and takes over his life, Mulder gets his bedroom renovated and equipped with a waterbed.<ref name="Dreamland"/> In "[[Monday (The X-Files)|Monday]]" he finds himself soaked through when his waterbed (which he can't remember getting, it is implied he thinks it was a present from Scully) is leaking.<ref name="Monday">{{cite episode| episodelink=Monday (The X-Files) | title=Monday | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Vince Gilligan]] & John Shiban | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 14}}</ref>

Mulder had a rather strained relationship with his parents [[List of The X-Files characters#Bill Mulder|Bill]] and [[List of The X-Files characters#Teena Mulder|Teena Mulder]], not least thanks to [[X-File|the X-Files]]. Initially, he had no idea his father was involved in the conspiracy and [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]]'s disappearance. Bill, who became disenchanted with the [[Shadow government (conspiracy)|shadow government]] and his own role in the conspiracy, eventually approached Fox about his past deeds, but was shot and killed by [[Alex Krycek]] - working as an assassin for the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] - before he could reveal any great amount of information.<ref name="Anasazi">{{cite episode| episodelink=Anasazi (The X-Files) | title=Anasazi | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[R.W. Goodwin]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 2 | number = 25}}</ref> Over the next few years, Mulder got into several conflicts with his mother while trying to discover the extent of her own knowledge of his father's precise involvement. Teena dies of an apparent suicide, when the stress of Samantha's abduction finally becomes too painful.<ref name="Sein_Und_Zeit">{{cite episode| episodelink=Sein Und Zeit (The X-Files) | title=Sein Und Zeit | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W.

During the last years of his work on the X-Files, Mulder was even forced to doubt that Bill was his true father. He is led to consider the possibility that his mother had had an affair with the [[Smoking Man]], a connection which may have resulted in the birth of either [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]] or Mulder himself.<ref name="Talitha_Cumi">{{cite episode| episodelink=Talitha Cumi (The X-Files) | title=Talitha Cumi | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits = [[R.W. Goodwin]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[David Duchovny]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 3 | number = 24 }}</ref> The possibility was hinted at later in the series, and [[Jeffrey Spender]], who certainly was the Smoking Man's son, said that Mulder was his [[half-brother]]. In the [[The X-Files (season 9)|ninth season]], "[[William (The X-Files)|William]]" explains that Spender and Mulder have very similar [[DNA]], providing strong evidence that they do have the same father.<ref name="William">{{cite episode| episodelink=William (The X-Files) | title=William | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[David Duchovny]] | writers =[[David Duchovny]], [[Frank Spotnitz]] & [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 9 | number = 16}}</ref><ref name="Two_Fathers">{{cite episode| episodelink=Two Fathers | title=Two Fathers | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Kim Manners]] | writers = [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] & [[Frank Spotnitz]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 6 | number = 11}}</ref>

Mulder's closest friend was [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|partner]] [[Dana Scully]], who was assigned to "debunk [his] work" by the conspirators and the FBI brass. But against their intentions, her loyalties quickly became affixed to Mulder's quest and Mulder himself, a connection which seemed to pull Mulder's work out of obscurity, as Scully's scientific bent afforded them a certain amount of credibility.<ref name="Pilot"/> Their intense professional and personal relationship continued to strengthen through the years. While the relationship was platonic for the greater part of the series, there are clues that it developed into a romantic one by the [[List of The X-Files episodes|last few seasons]].<ref name="Existence"/> Mulder and Scully almost always called each other by their [[surname]]s - Mulder purportedly hated his first name, but Scully had no such aversion.<ref name="Tooms"/> At the end of [[The X-Files (season 8)|season eight]], the romantic undertones were confirmed when the two shared a kiss.<ref name="Existence"/> In the [[The Truth (The X-Files)|series finale]], the very last scene depicted Mulder and Scully in bed together, contemplating what the future held.<ref name="The_Truth"/>

Mulder's greatest nemesis was [[The Smoking Man]], who, despite his obvious ill-intent, seemed to hold Mulder in special regard. Though he mocked Mulder to his face for his foolishness and the futility of his quest, in "[[Two Fathers]]" he told his son [[Jeffrey Spender]], "You pale to Fox Mulder."<ref name="Two_Fathers"/> Mulder also developed an intense enmity for [[Alex Krycek]], a double agent who briefly worked with Mulder in the FBI as an [[infiltrator]],<ref name="Sleepless">{{cite episode| episodelink=Sleepless (The X-Files) | title=Sleepless | series=The X-Files | serieslink=The X-Files |credits =[[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]] | writers = [[Howard Gordon]] | network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] | season = 2 | number = 4}}</ref> and who continued to serve as a recurring adversary, acting as an assassin for the Syndicate in the murders of [[List of The X-Files characters#Bill Mulder|Bill Mulder]] and [[List of The X-Files characters#Melissa Scully|Melissa Scully]].<ref name="The_Blessing_Way"/><ref name="Anasazi"/>

===Appearance===

Duchovny portrays Mulder as a series regular for the first seven seasons of the show. Duchovny left the show following the [[The X-Files (season 7)|seventh season finale]] "Requiem", wherein he was abducted by aliens. Although he makes a handful of cameos in the first part of season eight<U+2014>most notably in the episodes "Within", "Without", "The Gift", and "Per Manum"<U+2014>Mulder is returned by the aliens and the latter part of the season deals with his death, subsequent resurrection, and his departure from the FBI. After the conclusion of the eighth season, Duchovny left the show, and only appeared in four ninth season episodes: "Trust No 1", "Jump the Shark", "William", and "The Truth". Duchovny's appearances in "Trust No 1" and "Jump the Shark" were via archival footage, and he only made a small cameo in the third. However, his appearance in "The Truth", the program's series finale, was substantial, and Duchovny was once again listed in the credits as starring.

[[File:David Duchovny Golden Globe 2009 afterparty.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Duchovny portrayed Mulder, the [[main character]] in the first seven seasons of the series, and a [[recurring character]] in the last two.]]
[[David Duchovny]] had worked in [[Los Angeles]] three years prior to ''[[The X-Files]]''. At first he wanted to base his [[Acting|acting career]] around films, but in 1993 his [[Talent manager|manager]] Melanie Green gave him a script of the "[[The X-Files (pilot episode)|pilot episode]]" of ''The X-Files''. Green and Duchovny were both convinced it was a good script, so Duchovny auditioned for the lead.<ref name="Youtube">{{cite web |author=|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKpscCCG-nA |title=Inside the actor's studio - David Duchovny (part 1) |work=Youtube |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> When Duchovny was [[audition]]ing for the part of Fox Mulder, he made a "terrific" audition, but talked rather slowly. [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] thought that he was a "good judge of character", and thought that Duchovny wasn't too "bright". So he talked to Duchovny and asked him if he could "please" imagine himself as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI agent]] for the "future" weeks. The casting director of the show was very positive about him, while according to Carter, Duchovny turned out to be one of the best-read people he knew.<ref>{{cite web |author=Carter, Chris |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/xfiles/interviews/carter/clip0.shtml |title=Casting Mulder |work=BBC News |date= |accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> After getting the role, Duchovny thought the show wouldn't last for long or that it wouldn't make as much impact as it did.<ref name="Youtube"/>

Carter has said that he named Mulder after his mother's [[maiden name]]. His first name, Fox, was actually not a tribute to the Fox network which aired ''The X-Files'', as often assumed.
