'''Edmund Hobhouse''' (1817 <U+2013> 1904) was the English-born bishop of [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[New Zealand]], and an antiquary.

==Biography==
Edmund Hobhouse, born in [[London]] on 17 April 1817, was elder brother of [[Arthur Hobhouse, 1st Baron Hobhouse]], and was second son of [[Henry Hobhouse (archivist)|Henry Hobhouse]], under-secretary of state for the home department ([[Home Office]]). He entered [[Eton College|Eton]] in 1824, but left it in 1830 from ill-health and read with tutors. He matriculated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], on 16 December 1834, and graduated B.A. in 1838, proceeding M.A. in 1842, B.D. in 1851, and D.D. in 1858. He rowed in the Balliol boat for four years (1835<U+2013>8), and was stroke in 1836<U+2013>7. Oxford giving no facilities for theological study, Hobhouse went to [[Durham University]], where he graduated L.Th. in 1840. At his father's wish, he entered for a fellowship at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]], and was elected at his third trial in 1841. He was ordained deacon in the same year and priest in 1842. In 1843 he became vicar of the college living of St. Peter in the East, Oxford, which he held with his fellowship till 1858.<ref name="dnb">{{cite web  | last=Buckland  | first =A.

Hobhouse worked his parish with zeal and declined offers of better preferment. Bishop [[Samuel Wilberforce]] made him rural dean, and as secretary of the diocesan board of education he did much for the church schools, and helped to found the [[Culham]] training college for schoolmasters. On his father's death in 1854 he devoted part of his patrimony to providing at [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St. Edmund Hall]] and [[Merton College, Oxford#St Alban Hall|St. Alban Hall]], Oxford, help for necessitous students. On the subdivision of the diocese of New Zealand, Bishop [[George Augustus Selwyn]] obtained the appointment of Hobhouse to the new [[Diocese of Nelson|see of Nelson]], for which he was consecrated in 1858. The diocese, extending over {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}, had a sparse and scattered population, with few roads. Its difficulties were increased by the outbreak of the [[New Zealand land wars]] and by the discovery of gold. Hobhouse was diligent in ministering to his scattered flock, was generous in hospitality, provided a residence for the holder of the see, and founded the Bishop's School. But the work broke down his health; he resigned the see in 1865 and returned home in 1866.<ref name="dnb"/> 

In 1867 he became incumbent of [[Beech Hill, England|Beech Hill]], near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. On Bishop Selwyn's translation to [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]] he made Hobhouse, in 1869, his assistant bishop, and in 1871 gave him the rectory of [[Edlaston]], [[Derbyshire]]. During 1874<U+2013>5 he was chancellor of the diocese, though he had no legal training. On the death of Selwyn in 1878, the new bishop, W. D. Maclagan, retained him as assistant; but ill-health led him to resign in 1881. He retired to [[Wells]], lending aid to clergy around him but refusing office. The Somerset Arch<U+00E6>ological Society gained in him an active member, and he helped to found the Somerset Record Society. He died at Wells on 20 April 1904.<ref name="dnb"/> 

Hobhouse was twice married: (1) in 1858 to Mary Elizabeth, daughter of General the Hon. John Brodrick (d 1864), by whom he had two sons; and (2) in 1868 to Anna Maria, daughter of [[David Williams (New College)|David Williams]], [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of [[New College, Oxford]], who survived him.<ref name="dnb"/> 

Hobhouse, who was from his Oxford days a zealous student of English medi<U+00E6>val history, more especially on its ecclesiastical side, published ''A Sketch of the Life of Walter de Merton'' (1859), and edited the ''Register of Robert de Norbury, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry'' (in ''Collections for a History of Staffordshire'', vol. i. 1880). For the Somerset Record Society he edited ''Calendar of the Register of John de Drokensford, 1309<U+2013>1329'' (1887); ''Churchwardens' Accounts of Croscombe, &c.'' (1890); ''Rentalia et Custumaria Michaelis de Ambresbury'' (1891); and (with other members of the council) ''Two Cartularies of the Augustinian Priory of Bruton and the Cluniac Priory of Montacute'' (1894). A volume of sermons and addresses was printed in 1905.<ref name="dnb"/>
