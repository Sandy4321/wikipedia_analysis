'''''Spider-Man''''' is a [[2002 in film|2002]] [[United States|American]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Spider-Man]].  The film is the first in the [[Spider-Man film series|''Spider-Man'' film series]].  The film was written by [[David Koepp]], and directed by [[Sam Raimi]]. It stars [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Willem Dafoe]]. 

The film begins with Peter Parker, a high school student, being bitten by a genetically altered spider. After misusing his newly given abilities, which indirectly caused the death of his [[Benjamin Parker|Uncle Ben]], he becomes the heroic Spider-Man. Peter hopes to win the heart of [[Mary Jane Watson]], the girl he has loved since he was a boy, and battles the villainous [[Green Goblin]], who is the father of Peter's best friend, [[Harry Osborn]]. 

After being stuck in [[development hell]] for nearly 25 years, the film was released on [[May 3]], [[2002]] to good reviews from critics, went on to break box office records, and became the highest grossing film of 2002. The success of the film led to two sequels, ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''.

==Plot==
[[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], his best friend [[Harry Osborn]], and secret crush [[Mary Jane Watson]] visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] "super spider", and arrives home and passes out with the bite wound considerably swollen. Meanwhile, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], Harry's father, attempts to preserve his company's military contract from a rival firm, personally experimenting with his company's new but unstable performance-enhancing chemical vapor to increase his speed, strength, and stamina. Afterward, he goes into an uncontrollable rage and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter finds that his previously impaired vision has improved to 20/20 and that his body has [[metamorphosis|metamorphosized]] into a more muscular physique. When Peter goes to school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with [[Flash Thompson]]. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. Peter quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists.

Lying to his aunt and uncle about where he is going, Peter decides to enter a wrestling tournament to get money to buy a car and impress Mary Jane. During an argument, [[Benjamin Parker|Uncle Ben]] advises Peter, "With great power comes great responsibility." Peter lashes out at his uncle and leaves for the tournament. Peter wins, but is cheated out of the contest money. In retaliation he allows a thief to escape with the promoter's gate money. Afterward, Peter finds his uncle has been carjacked and killed. Peter tracks down the carjacker only to find out it was the same thief he allowed to escape earlier. During the struggle, the carjacker falls out of a window and dies. Upon graduating, Peter decides to use his abilities to fight injustice, and dons a new costume and the persona of Spider-Man. Peter is hired as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] [[photographer]] when he arrives in newspaper editor [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s office with the only clear images of Spider-Man. 
[[Image:SpideyandGoblin.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Spider-Man fights with the Green Goblin]]
Norman, upon finding out that Oscorp's board members plan to sell the company, attacks them at the World Unity Fair. Although he successfully murders them, Peter engages him as Spider-Man and drives him off as he threatens Mary Jane Watson. Jameson quickly dubs Norman as the [[Green Goblin]]. The Goblin offers Spider-Man a place at his side as he sees how the authorities mistrust him, but Spider-Man refuses, knowing that it is the right thing to do. The Goblin commits [[arson]] to engage him with a final offer, which Spider-Man refuses, and the Goblin becomes set on killing him. At the Osborn and Parkers' [[Thanksgiving]] dinner, Norman notices Peter's wound from the masked confrontation and leaves shortly thereafter. Feeling betrayed by Peter, and having found a personal annoyance with Aunt May, he attacks her. Whilst she recovers in the hospital, Mary Jane admits she has a crush on Spider-Man, who rescued her on numerous occasions, and asks Peter whether he ever asked about her. Peter reflects on his own feelings, during which Harry Osborn enters. Feeling betrayed by his girlfriend, Harry becomes fully loyal to his father, and tells him whom Peter loves the most.

The Goblin strikes, holding Mary Jane and a [[tram]] car full of children hostage on top the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. The Goblin tells Spider-Man to choose who he wants to save, and when Spider-Man refuses to choose, the Goblin drops his hostages. Spider-Man manages to save both Mary Jane and the tram car, whilst the Goblin is pelted at by civilians, showing loyalty to Spider-Man and proving him wrong by telling the Goblin that if "you mess with him, you mess with New York." The Goblin then grabs Spider-Man and throws him into an abandoned building and begins to beat him. The tables turn as the Goblin boasts of how he will later kill Mary Jane, and an enraged Spider-Man forces him into being unmasked. Norman begs for forgiveness, but his Goblin persona attempts to remote-control his glider to impale Spider-Man. The superhero evades the attack, causing the glider to impale Norman instead, and he dies asking Peter not to reveal his secret to Harry. At Norman<U+2019>s funeral, Harry swears vengeance toward Spider-Man, who he believes is responsible for killing his father, and asserts that Peter is all he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she<U+2019>s in love with him, but Peter, feeling that he must protect her, hides his true feelings. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Uncle Ben's words, "With great power comes great responsibility."

===Filming===
With ''Spider-Man'' cast, filming was set to begin the following November in [[New York City]] and on Sony [[soundstage]]s. The film was set for release a year later,<ref name="spins" /> but when the film was postponed to be released on [[May 3]], [[2002]],<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034459p1.html | title=''Spider-Man'' Crawls Into 2002 | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2000-09-14]] | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}</ref> the shoot began on [[January 8]] [[2001]]<ref name="greg"/> in [[Culver City]]. Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw ([[Randy Savage]]). Stage 27 was also used for the complex [[Times Square]] sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in [[Downey, California]].<ref name="booklet">DVD Booklet (2002), p.2-3</ref> On March 6,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20010307/ai_n10685510 | title = Noteworthy | publisher = Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | date = [[2001-03-07]] | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in.

In [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], locations included the Natural History Museum (for the [[Columbia University]] lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the [[Daily Bugle]] offices) and the Greystone Mansion for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home. In April, some of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward, although they were never returned.<ref>{{cite news | title = They Took Spidey's Clothes! | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date=[[2001-04-05]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2001-04-05#film3 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> Production moved to [[New York City]] for two weeks, taking in locations such as the [[Queensboro Bridge]], the exterior of Columbia University's Law Library and a rooftop garden in the [[Rockefeller Center]].<ref name="booklet"/>  The crew returned to L.A. where production was finished in June.<ref name="greg"/>

===Effects===
To create the costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape.<ref>{{cite news | author=Josh Tyrangiel | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997713,00.html?promoid=googlep | title=He has radioactive blood, now about those pecs | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=[[2000-08-14]] | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}</ref> It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask.

Visual effects supervisor [[John Dykstra]] was hired to produce the visual effects for ''Spider-Man'' in May 2000.<ref>{{cite news | author=Scott Chitwood | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034448p1.html | title=Dykstra to animate Spider-Man | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=[[2000-05-10]] | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}</ref> He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts [[computer generated]], as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.<ref name="HBO"/> Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, "[[ballet]] in the sky." The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70 million to around $100 million.<ref name="empire"/>

Dykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of being Spider-Man, being, "the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero." Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.<ref>{{cite news | author=Phillip Zonkel | url= | title=SPINNING `SPIDER-MAN'S' VISUAL EFFECTS WEB -

==Release==
[[Image:Bannedposter.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Unused ''Spider-Man'' teaser poster]]
After the [[9/11|terrorist attacks]] on the United States of [[September 11]], [[2001]], Sony recalled teaser posters which showed a close-up of Spider-Man's face with the New York skyline (including, prominently, the [[World Trade Center]] towers) reflected in his eyes. The movie's original trailer, released in 2001, featured a group of bank robbers on their getaway in a helicopter, which Spider-Man catches in a giant spider-web between the two towers of the World Trade Center. The trailer was pulled after the events of [[September 11, 2001, attacks]] and can be found on the internet.<ref>{{cite news | author = KJB | title = Sony Pulls Spider-Man Teaser Trailer & Poster | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2001-09-13]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/305/305861p1.html | accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref>

Before ''Spider-Man'''s [[United Kingdom|British]] theatrical release in June 2002, the [[BBFC]] gave the film a '12' certificate. Due to Spider-Man's popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended their decision, arguing that the film could have been given a '15'. Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a 'PG', and Tameside council, [[Manchester]], denoted it a 'PG-12'.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parents warned of Spider-Man violence|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2002-06-13]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2042729.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref> In late August, the BBFC relaxed their policy to '12A', leading Sony to re-release the film.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film ratings for children relaxed|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=[[2002-08-29]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2222009.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction to the film was mostly positive. Film review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] calculated a 90% overall approval based on 200 reviews, and it scored an 84% Cream of the Crop rating from major news outlets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman/?critic=creamcrop | title=Spider-Man Rotten Tomatoes view | publisher=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, is often cited as one of the high points of the film. Eric Harrison, of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', was initially skeptical of the casting of Tobey Maguire, but, after seeing the film, he stated, "within seconds, however, it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role."<ref name="Harrison">{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1394713.html | title=Harrison review | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of 1978's ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''.<ref name="Mike Clark">{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-05-03-spider-man.htm#more | title=Mike Clark review | publisher=[[USA Today]] | date=[[2002-05-03]] | accessdate=2007-01-23}}</ref> Owen Gleiberman, of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. "Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey -- the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger -- together."<ref name="Gleiberman">{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,234775~1~0~spider-man,00.html | title=Entertainment Weekly review | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=[[2002-05-01]] | accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''s Kirk Honeycutt thought, "the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss -- after one of his many rescues of her -- to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures."<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1468913 | title=Hollywood Reporter review | publisher=Hollywood Report | date=[[2002-04-19]] | accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> 

Not all of the criticism was good, as ''[[LA Weekly]]'''s Manohla Dargis wrote, "It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film/i-bug/3951/ | title=I, Bug | publisher=LA Weekly | date= | accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> Giving it 2.5/4 stars, [[Roger Ebert]] felt the film lacked a decent action element; "Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea."<ref name="Ebert">{{cite web | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020503/REVIEWS/205030303/1023 | title=Roger Ebert review | publisher=Chicago Sun-Times | date=[[2002-05-03]] | accessdate=2007-01-26}}</ref> Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the [[Green Goblin]]'s costume, which led Richard George of ''[[IGN]]'' to comment years later, "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from ''Spider-Man'' is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression."<ref>{{cite news | author = Richard George | title = Spider-Man in Film: Volume One | publisher = [[IGN]] | date=[[2007-04-19]]|url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>
