The game first appeared on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], then was ported by [[TOSE]] with minor differences to [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]]. It was first released in [[North America]] as "''Final Fantasy III''", although the original title has been restored in later releases.

The game's story focuses on a group of [[rebellion|rebels]] as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. ''Final Fantasy VI'' was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]]; the role was filled instead by [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Hiroyuki It<U+014D>]].<ref name="directors">{{cite web | author=Coxon, Sachi | date=1998 | title=Interview with Hironobu Sakaguchi | url=http://members.tripod.com/PlayStationJapan/Sakaguchi.html | publisher=PlayStation Japan | accessdate=2006-07-15}}</ref><ref name="directors2">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=55 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref> Released to critical acclaim,<ref name="oldschoolegm">{{cite web | date=2004-10-01 | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-13232831_ITM | title=Old School Electronic Gaming Monthly | publisher=AccessMyLibrary; originally published in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' | accessdate=2008-03-03}}</ref><ref name="nintendopower">{{cite book|title=Game Reviews: Final Fantasy III | publisher=[[Nintendo Power]] | date=October , 2004}}</ref><ref name="magazines">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy III for SNES Reviews<U+2014>SNES Final Fantasy III Reviews | url=http://www.gamespot.com/snes/rpg/finalfantasy3/review.html?mode=web | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> the game is regarded as a landmark of the series and of the role-playing genre.<ref name="gamespotanthology">{{cite web | author=Vestal, Andrew | title=Final Fantasy Anthology Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/rpg/finalfantasyanthology/review.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

''Final Fantasy VI'' has more battle customization options than its predecessors and has the largest playable cast in the ''Final Fantasy'' series to date, excluding spin-off titles. It remains widely praised for its storyline and characters.<ref name="gamespotanthology"/><ref name="ign">{{cite web | author=Reyes, Francesca | title=Final Fantasy Anthology | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161674p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:FFVITown.PNG|thumb|left|Navigation on a town's field map]]
Like previous ''Final Fantasy'' installments, ''Final Fantasy VI'' consists of four basic modes of [[gameplay]]: an [[overworld]] map, town and [[Dungeon (games)|dungeon]] field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a scaled-down version of the game's [[fictional universe|fictional world]], which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, [[chocobo]], and [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Airships|airship]]. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are [[random encounter|randomly encountered]] on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot.

The game's plot develops as the player progresses through towns and dungeons. Town citizens will offer helpful information and some residents own item or equipment shops. Later in the game, visiting certain towns will activate [[quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side-quests]]. Dungeons appear as a variety of areas, including caves, sewers, forests, and buildings. These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Some dungeons feature puzzles and mazes, which require the player to divide the characters into multiple parties.<ref name="basicinfo">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=39 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>

The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters will be in the travelling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track [[experience point|experience points and levels]].

===Combat===
Combat in ''Final Fantasy VI'' is [[Menu (computing)|menu]]-based, in which the player selects an action from a list of such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four characters may be used in battles, which uses the series' traditional [[Final Fantasy battle systems#Active Time Battle|Active Time Battle]] system, or ATB, which was designed by Hiroyuki It<U+014D> and first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate dependent on their speed [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistic]]. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' ''Runic'' ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with [[experience point]]s and money, called [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Currency|gil]] ([[Gold Piece|GP]] in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, which increases their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://na.square-enix.com/games/anthology/FFVI/battle.html | title=Final Fantasy VI<U+2014>Battle Systems | date=2002 | publisher=[[Square Enix]] | accessdate=2006-07-21}}</ref>

[[Image:WikibattleFF6.PNG|thumb|left|175px|A battle in ''Final Fantasy VI'']]

In contrast to previous versions of the ''Active Time Battle'' system, the player is able to pick from any character that has a filled action bar and has not yet received any commands, rather than being forced to issue commands to whichever character had his or her action bar filled first. Another new element is [[Common elements of Final Fantasy#Battle systems and Limit Breaks|a powerful attack substitution]] that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later ''Final Fantasy'' titles under a variety of different names, including Limit Breaks, Trances, and Overdrives.

===Customization===
Characters in ''Final Fantasy VI'' can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons, armor and accessories (known as "Relics") to increase their statistics and obtain special abilities. Most of this equipment can be used by several different characters, and each character may equip up to two Relics. Relics have a variety of uses and effects, some of which alter basic battle commands, allow characters to use multiple weapons, provide permanent status changes during battle or use protective [[Final Fantasy magic|magical spells]] in response to being near death.<ref name="basicinfo2">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=49 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>

Although only two characters start the game with the ability to use magic, almost every character can learn to do so. Characters may equip [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Espers|magicite]], which enables the [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|summoning]] of [[esper]]s, this game's incarnation of summoned monsters (including several recurring summons such as Ifrit, Shiva, Bahamut and Odin, along with many new summons exclusive to ''Final Fantasy VI''), as well as that of specific magic spells. If a character has a piece of magicite equipped, he or she will gain "Magic Acquisition Points" after most battles. As a character gains magic AP, he or she gradually learns spells from the magicite equipped and will gain additional statistic bonuses when leveling up, depending on the magicite.<ref name="basicinfo3">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=47 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>

===Setting===
[[Image:WoBFFVI.JPG|thumb|A map of the World of Balance]]
''Final Fantasy VI'' takes place on a large, unnamed world. During the course of the game, its geography and landscape change due to various developments in the game's plot. During the first half of the game, the world is divided into two major continents and referred to as the World of Balance. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player. Halfway through the game, the world's geographical layout is altered, resulting in its two large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center. This altered layout of the game's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.

In contrast to the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] settings featured in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, ''Final Fantasy VI'' is set in a [[steampunk]] environment. The structure of society parallels that of the latter half of the 19th century, with [[opera]] and the [[fine art]]s serving as recurring motifs throughout the game,<ref name="NPC in Jidor">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English |quote='''(NPC in Jidoor)''' You like art? No? Philistines!}}</ref> and a level of technology comparable to that of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] are in place and a [[coal mining]] operation is run in the northern town of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Narshe]]. Additionally, several examples of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a [[chainsaw]], [[Drill#Cordless drills|power drill]] and automatic [[crossbow]]) have been developed in the kingdom of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Figaro]]. However, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, with letters sent by way of [[carrier pigeon]] serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.

The in-game historical context of the story is mysterious to the player at the beginning of the game, but over the course of the first half of the game (particularly towards the end of this segment), the characters come to understand the situation as follows. One thousand years before the events of the game, three gods who served as the source of all magic in the world were at war with one another. This quarrel released magical energy into the world, transforming any human touched by it into an [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Espers|esper]], each under the control of the gods. The gods, known as the Warring Triad, then used the espers as soldiers in their war against one another in a conflict known as the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#War of the Magi|War of the Magi]]. Eventually, the gods realized their war had disgraced them, and in order to repent, they returned free will to the espers and turned themselves to stone. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain sealed so that it could not be misused again.<ref name="Statues">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English |quote='''Left statue:''' The birth of magic... three goddesses were banished here. In time they began quarreling, which led to all-out war. Those unlucky humans who got in the way were transformed to Espers, and used as living war machines. / '''Right Statue:''' The goddesses finally realized that they were being laughed at by those who had banished them here. In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to seal themselves away from the world. With their last ounce of energy they gave the Espers back their own free will, and then transformed themselves... ...into stone. Their only request was that the Espers keep them sealed away from all eternity. / '''Center Statue:''' The Espers created these statues as a symbol of their vow to let the goddesses sleep in peace. The Espers have sworn to keep the goddesses' power from being abused.}}</ref> When the war ended, the remaining humans and espers were burdened with differences in lifestyle, appearance, and beliefs. As a result, the espers departed to a hidden land, taking the statues of the gods with them and sealing the entrance to their world.

Gradually, the human race built a society based on technology while the War of the Magi passed into legend.<ref name="Game opening">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English |quote='''(Game opening)''' Long ago, the War of the Magi reduced the world to a scorched wasteland, and magic simply ceased to exist. 1000 years have passed... Iron, gunpowder and steam engines have been rediscovered, and high technology reigns...}}</ref> In the present day, the most powerful technology is in the hands of the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Gestahlian Empire|Empire]], a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Emperor Gestahl|Emperor Gestahl]] and his top generals, [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Kefka|Kefka]], [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Leo Cristophe|Leo]] and [[Celes Chere]]. Approximately eighteen years before the events of the game begin, the barrier between the esper's land and the rest of the world weakens and a human woman passes through. Though most of the espers are untrusting of her and believe that humans cannot co-exist with espers, one named [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Maduin and Madeline|Maduin]] believes that they should at least try before passing judgment.<ref name="Coexistence">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English |quote='''Madonna:''' But humans and Espers can never coexist...! '''Maduin:''' How do we know for sure unless we observe for ourselves?}}</ref> The woman stays in the espers' world, and soon she and Maduin have a child named Terra. At this time, driven by greed to wield the legendary power of the espers, Gestahl takes advantage of the weakened barrier and launches a strike on the espers' land in an attempt to capture as many espers as possible. Despite the esper elder casting a spell to send Gestahl's forces back through the gateway and to seal the gate once again, many espers are captured, and Maduin, his wife, and infant Terra are also caught in the spell. Maduin and his child are captured, while his wife dies.

Using the espers as a power source, Gestahl initiated a research program to combine magic with machinery and infuse humans with magical powers, the result being a technology known as [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Magitek|Magitek]]. The Empire allocated this concept of Magitek into large mechanical vehicles known as Magitek Armor, allowing a soldier to use the power of magic. Additionally, Kefka was infused with magic, becoming one of the prototypes in a line of soldiers called Magitek Knights that would later include [[Celes Chere]]. The process was still experimental in the prototype phase and as a result, Kefka's sanity was impaired.<ref name="NPC in Vector">{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English |quote='''(NPC in Vector)''' That guy Kefka?

Though the potency of Magitek is less than that of natural magic, as of the beginning of the game, the Empire is on the verge of rediscovering the full potential of magic by reopening the gateway to the world of the espers. However, the Empire's rule is opposed by the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Resistance|Returners]], a group of rebels seeking to overthrow the Empire and free its territories.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Final Fantasy VI}}

''Final Fantasy VI'' features fourteen permanent [[player character|playable characters]], the most of any game in the main series, as well as several secondary characters who are only briefly controlled by the player. Primary characters include [[Terra Branford]], a reserved half-human, half-esper girl who spent most of her life as a slave to the Empire and is unfamiliar with love; [[Locke Cole]], a treasure hunter and rebel sympathizer with a powerful impulse to protect women; [[Celes Chere]], a former general of the Empire, who joined the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Resistance|Returners]] after being jailed for questioning imperial practices; [[Edgar Roni Figaro]], a consummate womanizer and the king of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Figaro]], who claims allegiance to the Empire while secretly supplying aid to the Returners;<ref name=Edgar>'''Locke:''' On the surface, Edgar pretends to support the Empire. The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire. I am his contact with that group... The old man you met in Narshe is one of us. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English}}</ref> [[Sabin Rene Figaro]], Edgar's brother, who fled the royal court in order to pursue his own path and hone his [[martial arts]] skills; [[Cyan Garamonde]], a loyal knight to the kingdom of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Doma]] who lost his family and friends as a result of [[Kefka]] poisoning the kingdom's water supply; [[Setzer Gabbiani]], a habitual gambler and thrill seeker; [[Shadow (Final Fantasy VI)|Shadow]], a [[ninja]] [[mercenary]], who offers his services to both the Empire and the Returners at various stages throughout the game; [[Relm Arrowny]], a young but tough artistic girl with magical powers; [[Strago Magus]], Relm's elderly grandfather and a [[Blue Mage]]; [[Gau (Final Fantasy VI)|Gau]], a [[feral child]] surviving since infancy in the harsh wilderness known as the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Veldt]]; [[Mog (Final Fantasy VI)|Mog]], a [[Moogle]] from the mines of Narshe; [[Umaro]], a savage but loyal [[Bigfoot|sasquatch]] also from Narshe, talked into joining the Returners through Mog's persuasion; and [[Gogo (Final Fantasy)|Gogo]], a mysterious, fully shrouded master of the art of [[mimic]]ry.

Most of the main characters in the game hold a significant grudge against the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Gestahlian Empire|Empire]] and, in particular, Kefka, who serves as one of the game's main [[antagonist]]s along with [[Emperor Gestahl]]. The supporting character [[Ultros]] serves as a recurring [[villain]] and [[comic relief]] throughout the game. A handful of ''Final Fantasy VI'' characters have reappeared in later games, such as ''[[Secret of Evermore]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. Additionally, ''[[#Interactive CG Game|Final Fantasy SGI]]'', a short [[technology demo]] produced for the [[Silicon Graphics]] [[SGI Onyx|Onyx]] workstation, featured [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]] based [[3D computer graphics|3D]] renderings of Locke, Terra and Shadow.<ref name="development6">{{cite web | author=Sutherland, Kenny | date=2003 | title=Elusions: Final Fantasy 64 | url=http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ | publisher=LostLevels | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref><ref name="development7">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy SGI Demo | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/affw/ffsgi.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>

===Story===

''Final Fantasy VI'' begins with Terra Branford participating in an Imperial raid on [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Narshe]] in search of a recently unearthed frozen [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Espers|esper]] (later identified as Tritoch; Valigarmanda in the GBA retranslation) found in the city's mines. However, during the raid, her controllers are killed and the Imperial control over her is broken, but she is unable to remember anything about her past.<ref>'''Terra:''' You... saved me? / '''Locke:''' Save your thanks for the Moogles! / '''Terra:''' Uhh... I can't remember anything... past or present... / '''Locke:''' You have amnesia!? {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English}}</ref> Locke Cole, a thief, promises to protect her until she can regain her memories and helps her escape to the hideout of the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Resistance|Returners]], a group of militants opposing the Empire. Along the way, they pass through the Kingdom of Figaro and meet Edgar Roni Figaro, the king, and his estranged brother, Sabin Rene Figaro, who join them. [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Banon|Banon]], the leader of the Returners, asks for Terra's help in their struggle against the Empire, and she agrees.<ref>'''Banon:''' Have you made a decision? Will you become our last ray of hope? ... / '''Terra:''' I'll do it! {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English}}</ref> Just as the resistance is preparing to return to Narshe to investigate the frozen esper, the Empire attacks [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|South Figaro]]. Locke heads to the besieged town to slow the Empire's advance, while the rest of the group makes their way via [[rafting]] down the nearby Lethe River. However, they become separated after a battle with [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Ultros|Ultros]], self-proclaimed "octopus royalty" and a recurring antagonist, forcing the various members of the Returners to find their own ways to Narshe in three different scenarios controlled by the player.

Eventually, the original party reunites in Narshe. Locke brings with him Celes Chere, one of the Empire's own generals, whom he saved from execution for defying the Empire's ruthless practices. Sabin brings with him Cyan Garamonde, whose family was killed during the Empire's siege of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Doma Castle]] when Kefka ordered the water supply poisoned, and Gau, a feral child he befriended on the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Veldt]]. In Narshe, the Returners prepare to defend the frozen esper from the Empire. After the player successfully thwarts the Imperial invasion, Terra approaches the frozen esper, prompting her to transform into an esper-like form herself. She flies away, confused and horrified by her own transformation.<ref>'''Locke:''' ...Where's Terra? / '''Celes:''' She changed into a...something, and...took off. She looked like... She looked like...an Esper... {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English}}</ref>

The Returners set out to search for Terra and eventually trace her to the city of [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Zozo]], though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper. There, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Magitek|Magitek Research Facility]] in the Empire's capital, [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Geography|Vector]], they may find one who can help Terra.<ref>'''(Unidentified character)''' Terra looks like she's in pain. / '''Ramuh:''' Her very existence strikes fear into her own heart. / '''(Unidentified character)''' How can we help her? / '''Ramuh:''' When she accepts this aspect of herself, I think she'll be all right. / '''(Unidentified character)''' We have to help her! / '''Ramuh:''' Then free those of my kind imprisoned in Gestahl's Magitek Research Facility. One of them can surely help her. {{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy III |developer=Square Co |publisher=Square Soft |date=1994-10-11 |platform=Super Nintendo Entertainment System |language=English}}</ref> Vector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who is believed to be the owner of the [[List of Final Fantasy airships#Final Fantasy VI|Blackjack]], the only [[airship]] in the world. They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Maduin and Madeline|Maduin]], who is revealed to be Terra's father. However, the espers choose instead to give their lives to transform into [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Espers|magicite]]<U+2014>the crystallized remains of their essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers<ref>'''Ramuh:''' Gestahl's method is incorrect.

After reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide that it is time to launch an all-out attack on the Empire, and Banon asks Terra to attempt contacting the espers' land in order to gain their support.<ref>'''Arvis:''' I see... Your plan would combine Narshe's money with Figaro's machinery to storm the Empire... not enough manpower, though... / '''Banon:''' We have to open the sealed gate... Terra!? / '''Terra:''' To the Esper World...? / '''Arvis:''' We'll never beat the Empire without them. / '''Banon:''' When the gate has been opened, the Espers can attack from the east. We'll storm in at the same time, from the north. No way around it. We MUST get the Espers to understand. We have to establish a bond of trust between humans and Espers. Only one person can do this...

When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace. Gestahl asks Terra to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees.<ref>'''Gestahl:''' I've lost my will to fight... ... / '''Gestahl:''' I've ordered this war to be over!

Soon, they find the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and capturing the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware that the peace was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land.<ref>'''Kefka:''' G'ha, ha, ha!

The Returners attempt to stop them from causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.

One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on a deserted island and learns that the world has been devastated by Kefka. Much of its human population has died and its plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness to punctuate humanity's despair.<ref>'''Cid:''' Celes... at last...!

One by one, in a series of mostly optional [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side-quests]], the gamer has the opportunity to reunite the group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Each character has a side-quest that dramatically increases their power. Together, the reunited Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka, using the [[List of Final Fantasy airships#Final Fantasy VI|Falcon]]<U+2014>an airship that belonged to a deceased friend of Setzer's<U+2014>to reach Kefka's Tower and infiltrate it. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.

Making a final stand against Kefka, the characters successfully destroy him, but since the gods' power had come to reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka's magically-maintained tower begins to crumble. Terra leads the characters out as she begins to weaken due to her half-esper heritage.<ref>'''Celes:''' Terra! What's wrong? The Magicite...

In the end, the party escapes Kefka's Tower aboard the Falcon. Terra survives, and the group observes the world's communities rejuvenating themselves.

===Soundtrack===
{{main|Music of Final Fantasy VI}}

The soundtrack for ''Final Fantasy VI'' is the work of long-time series contributor [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The score consists of themes for each major character and location, as well as music for standard battles, fights with [[boss (video games)|boss]] enemies and for special cutscenes. The extensive use of [[leitmotif]] is one of the defining points of the audio tracks. The "[[Aria di Mezzo Carattere]]" is one of the latter tracks, played during a cutscene involving an [[opera]] performance. This track features an unintelligible synthesized "voice" that harmonizes with the melody, as technical limitations for the [[SPC700]] [[sound format]] chip prevented the use of an actual [[vocal music|vocal track]] (although some developers eventually figured out how to overcome the limitation a few years later). The orchestral album ''[[Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale]]'' features an arranged version of the [[aria]], using [[Italian language|Italian]] [[lyrics]] performed by Svetla Krasteva with an orchestral accompaniment. This version is also found in the ending [[full motion video]] of the game's [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation]] re-release, with the same lyrics but a different musical [[arrangement]]. In addition, the [[album]] ''[[Orchestral Game Concert 4]]'' includes an extended version of the opera arranged and conducted by K<U+014D>suke Onozaki and performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra, featuring Wakako Aokimi, Tetsuya <U+014C>no, and Hiroshi Kuroda on vocals.<ref name="extaria">{{cite web | author=Farand, Eric | title=Original Game Concert 4 | url=http://rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ogc4/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2006-08-10}}</ref>  It was also performed at the "More Friends" concert<ref name="daetrin">{{cite web| title=Uematsu's Music<U+2014>More Friends | url=http://www.square-enix-usa.com/uematsu/concert/more_friends.html | publisher=Square Enix USA | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]] in 2005 using a new English translation of the lyrics, an album of which is now available.<ref name="daetrin2">{{cite web | author=Gann, Patrick | title=More Friends music from Final Fantasy ~Los Angeles Live 2005~ | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ffmorela/index.html | publisher=[[RPGFan]] | accessdate=2007-06-20}}</ref> "[[Dancing Mad]]," accompanying the game's final battle with [[Kefka]], is 17 minutes long and contains an [[Organ (music)|organ]] [[cadenza]], with variations on Kefka's theme.

===Graphics===
[[Yoshitaka Amano]], another long-time contributor to the ''Final Fantasy'' series, returned as the image and character designer. Amano provided concept sketches to the programmers, who converted them into the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s featured in the game due to technical limitations of the time.<ref name="amanodesigns">{{cite web | author=Mat | title=Interview with Yoshitaka Amano, Concept Illustrator for Final Fantasy IX | url=http://eboredom.20m.com/features/interviews/amano.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041013155809/http://www.eboredom.20m.com/features/interviews/amano.html | archivedate=2004-10-13 | publisher=E Boredom | accessdate=2006-07-22}}</ref> Liberties were taken during the conversion, such as changing Terra Branford's hair from [[blonde]] to [[green]], and changing Celes Chere's [[outfit]] entirely. Amano also designed the title logo. The graphics were directed by [[Tetsuya Takahashi]] (graphic chief)<ref name="ffx"/>, Hideo Minaba (background graphics)<ref name="ffx"/>, Kazuko Shibuya (object graphic)<ref name="ffx"/> and [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (designer for some characters)<ref name="ffx"/>. In the [[full motion video]]s produced for the game's PlayStation re-release, the character designs featured are based on Amano's designs. 

While character sprites in the earlier installments were less detailed on the map than they were in battle, ''Final Fantasy VI'''s sprites had an equally high resolution regardless of the screen. This enabled the use of animations depicting a variety of movements and facial expressions.<ref name="Retro">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Retrospective Part IV | url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/23185.html | publisher=Gametrailers.com | accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>

Though it was not the first game to utilize the Super Nintendo's [[Mode 7]] graphics, ''Final Fantasy VI'' made more extensive use of them than its predecessors. For instance, unlike both ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'', the world map is rendered in Mode 7, which lends a somewhat [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] perspective to an otherwise [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional game]].<ref name="mode7">{{cite web | author=Otterland | title=Final Fantasy VI<U+2014>Retroview | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6rdrev14.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="mode7II">{{cite web | author=Tom | title=Final Fantasy Anthology<U+2014>Playstation Game Review | url=http://www.absolute-playstation.com/api_review/rffanthology.htm | publisher=Absolute-Playstation | accessdate=2006-07-22}}</ref><ref name="mode7III">{{cite web | author=Djibriel | title=Final Fantasy VI Review 4 | url=http://www.cavesofnarshe.com/reviews/review.php?game=6;num=4 | publisher=Caves of Narshe | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>

==Localization==
[[Image:FFVI_Siren_Censorship.png|thumb|Graphics for the North American releases were edited to cover up minor instances of nudity. From left to right: Original Japanese, North American SNES and North American GBA releases.]]
The original North American [[software localization|localization]] and release of ''Final Fantasy VI'' by [[Square Co.|Square]] for the Super Nintendo featured several changes from the original Japanese version. The most obvious of these is the change of the game's title from ''Final Fantasy VI'' to ''Final Fantasy III''; because only two games of the series had been localized in [[North America]] at the time, ''Final Fantasy VI'' was distributed as ''Final Fantasy III'' to maintain naming continuity. Unlike ''Final Fantasy IV'' (which was first released in North America as ''Final Fantasy II''), there are no major changes to gameplay, though certain editorial adjustments exist in the English script. In a January 1995 interview with ''[[Super PLAY|Super POWER]]'' magazine, translator [[Ted Woolsey]] explained that "there's a certain level of playfulness and ... sexuality in Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically because of [[Nintendo of America]]'s rules and guidelines".<ref>{{cite web | author=West, Neil | date=1994 | title=SUPER PLAY-Fantasy Quest: Interview with Ted Woolsey | publisher=Shadow Madness Classic | url=http://smc.smallcave.net/woolsey/superplay.php | accessdate=2005-02-01}}</ref> Consequently, objectionable graphics (e.g. nudity) were [[censorship|censored]] and building signs in towns were changed, as well as religious allusions (e.g. the spell [[Final Fantasy magic#White Magic|''Holy'']] was renamed ''Pearl'').

The localization also featured changes to several names, though some of these<U+2014>in the case of characters<U+2014>were necessitated by technical restrictions of only six letters per name (e.g. "Stragus" was shortened to "Strago").<ref name="woolsey">{{cite web | date=1997 | url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/wiki/index.php?title=Bob_Rork_Woolsey_Interview | title=Bob Rork Woolsey Interview | publisher=Chrono Compendium | accessdate=2006-07-16}}</ref> Other changes were made for the game to meet Nintendo's aforementioned content guidelines (which Nintendo of America did to most games before the founding of the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and its rating system)<ref>{{cite web | date=2007 | title=Nintendo Censorship | url=http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> and simply due to differences between [[Asia]]n and North American cultures. For example, Terra's Japanese name, Tina, sounds exotic to Japanese people, but is a common [[anglophone]] name.<ref name="woolsey"/> Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge's [[read-only memory]].<ref name="woolsey"/> As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.<ref>{{cite web | author=Chris | date=2007 | title=Transcript of Ted Woolsey Interview<U+2014>Player One Podcast | url=http://www.playeronepodcast.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=145 | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref> This translation was done in only 30 days by Woolsey alone.<ref>{{cite web | author=Parkin, Simon | date=2007 | title=Eurogamer: Final Fantasy VI advance review | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=73728 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

The PlayStation re-release featured only minor changes to the English localization. The title of the game was reverted back to ''Final Fantasy VI'' from ''Final Fantasy III'', to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of "Fenix Down" to "Phoenix Down." Unlike the PlayStation re-release of ''Final Fantasy IV'' included in the later ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged. Finally, while many fans continued to refer to the first "world" as the "World Of Balance" and the destroyed world as the "World Of Ruin", Square had begun to refer to the destruction event (that turns the Balance World to the Ruin World) as the "[[cataclysm]]" event, and in the bestiary unlockable, the game sorts the monsters as "Pre-C" (monsters that appear before the cataclysm) and Post-C (those that appear afterwards). This would continue throughout future translations, with the word being used more frequently to refer to the "world ending".

The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery.<ref>{{cite web | date=2007 | title=Final Fantasy VI advance info|publisher=[[GameFAQs]]| url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/data/930370.html | accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series. The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the original translation.<ref>{{cite web | author=Schreier, Jason | date=2007 | title=Final Fantasy VI Advance Staff Review |publisher=[[RPGamer]]| url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6gba/reviews/ff6gbastrev2.html | accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>

Moreover, they praised its gameplay and storyline, claiming that these aspects took "all ... preceding RPG concepts and either came up with something completely new or refined them enough to make them its own", creating an atmosphere in which "[players] won't find it difficult to get past the simplistic graphics or seemingly out-dated gameplay conventions and become involved ..."<ref name="ign">{{cite web | author=Reyes, Francesca | title=Final Fantasy Anthology | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/161/161674p1.html | publisher=[[IGN]]  | accessdate=2006-06-19}}</ref>

Alternatively, they describe the game's sound effects as limited and the game itself as lacking in replay value due to having "one ending, one [fundamental] path through the plot, and ... [mandatory] sidequests". Additionally, they regarded the game's English translation as "unremarkable", being "better than some but worse than others", and offered similar comments for its gameplay difficulty. However, they referred to the game's storyline as its "...&nbsp;most unique aspect", citing its large cast of characters, "nearly all of whom receive a great deal of development", and the "surprisingly large number of real world issues, the vast majority of which have not been addressed by any RPG before or since, ranging from teen pregnancy to suicide." Overall, RPGamer regarded the game as an "epic masterpiece" and "truly one of the greatest games ever created."<ref name="rpgamer">{{cite web | author=Alley, Jake| title=Final Fantasy VI<U+2014>Review | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev2.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref><ref name="rpgamer2">{{cite web | author=Lewis, Zachary | title=Final Fantasy VI<U+2014>Retroview | url= http://www.rpgamer.com/games/ff/ff6/reviews/ff6strev1.html | publisher=[[RPGamer]] | accessdate=2006-07-01}}</ref>

===Interactive CG Game===

'''''Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game''''' (also known as the ''Final Fantasy SGI demo'', or ''Final Fantasy x'' (not related to the actual 10th game in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'') was a short [[Game demo|demonstration]] produced by [[Square Co.|Square]] using characters and settings from ''Final Fantasy VI''. Produced using new [[Silicon Graphics|Silicon Graphics, Inc.]] (SGI) Onyx [[workstation]]s acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' title for the [[Nintendo 64]] [[video game console]], which also used SGI hardware.<ref>Lost Levels Online "[http://www.lostlevels.org/200510/ Elusions: ''Final Fantasy 64'']"</ref> Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console at the time of the demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of [[full motion video]] sequences for ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and subsequent games for the [[PlayStation]]. The demo itself featured [[Terra Branford]], [[Locke Cole]], and [[Shadow (Final Fantasy VI)|Shadow]] in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through [[mouse gesture]]s: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would [[Final Fantasy magic#Summoning Magic|summon]] a dragon to attack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasyanime.com/finalfantasy/ff6/ff6ff7.htm|title=The REAL Final Fantasy VII?|publisher=FantasyAnime|accessdate= 2005-08-26}}</ref>

==Re-releases==
===PlayStation===
''Final Fantasy VI'' was [[porting|ported]] to the Sony [[PlayStation]] by [[TOSE]] and re-released by [[Square Co.|Square]] in [[Japan]] and [[North America]] during {{vgy|1999}}. In Japan, it was available both individually and as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Collection]]'', while it was only available as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Anthology]]'' in North America. Fifty-thousand limited edition copies of the Japanese version were also released in Japan and included a ''Final Fantasy''-themed alarm clock.<ref name="Prerelease">{{cite web | title=Final Fantasy Collection Coming | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/066/066337p1.html | work=[http://ign.com/ IGN.com] | accessdate=27 July | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In {{vgy|2002}}, the standard edition became available in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories, and it was the first time that the game had seen an official release in those countries.

''Final Fantasy VI'''s PlayStation re-release is very similar to the original Japanese release as seen on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]]. With the exception of the addition of two full motion video opening and ending sequences and new effects used for the start and end of battles, the graphics, music and sound are left unchanged from the original version, though some have noted that the sound quality isn't as good as in the original.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaming-age.com/reviews/archive/old_reviews/psx/ffa/|title=Gaming Age review|accessdate=2007-08-15|author=Makar, Alex|publisher=Gaming Age}}</ref> The only notable changes to gameplay  (in addition to loading times not present in the cartridge versions) involve the correction of a few [[software bug]]s from the original, the creation or oversight of other bugs,<ref name="bugs">{{cite web | author=AWJ | date=2001 | title=Final Fantasy VI Evade Bug | url=http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1184905 | publisher=Everything2 | accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref><ref name="bugs2">{{cite web | author=Master ZED | date=2004 | title=Final Fantasy 3us/6j Glitches & Bugs guide | url=http://masterzed.cavesofnarshe.com/GameDocs/ff3bug.txt | publisher=Caves of Narshe | accessdate=2006-07-27}}</ref> and the addition of a new "memo save" feature, allowing players to quickly save their progress to the PlayStation's [[Random access memory|RAM]].<ref name="memo">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix staff | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=30 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref> The re-release included other special features, such as a [[bestiary]] and an artwork gallery.<ref name="bonuses">{{cite book | year=1999 | editor=Square Enix | title=Final Fantasy Anthology instruction manual | pages=50<U+2013>53 | publisher=Square Enix | language=English | id=SLUS-00900GH}}</ref>

===Game Boy Advance===
''Final Fantasy VI'' was ported a second time by [[TOSE]] and re-released as {{nihongo|'''''Final Fantasy VI Advance'''''|<U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30A4><U+30CA><U+30EB><U+30D5><U+30A1><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30B8><U+30FC>VI<U+30A2><U+30C9><U+30D0><U+30F3><U+30B9>|Fainaru Fantaj<U+012B> Shikkusu Adobansu}} by [[Square Enix]] in Japan on [[November 30]], [[2006]], by [[Nintendo]] in North America on [[February 5]], [[2007]] and in [[Europe]] on [[June 29]], [[2007]]<ref name="gbaeuro"/> for the [[Nintendo]] [[Game Boy Advance]]. It includes additional gameplay features and enhanced visuals, as well as a re-translated script that follows Japanese naming conventions for the spells and monsters, but it does not feature the full motion videos from the PlayStation release of the game. Four new [[World of Final Fantasy VI#Espers|espers]] appear in this re-release ([[Leviathan]], [[Gilgamesh (Final Fantasy)|Gilgamesh]], [[Monsters of Final Fantasy#Cactuar|Cactuar]], and Diabolos), along with a new dungeon called the Dragons' Den (which includes the CzarDragon, here known as Kaiser Dragon, coded but not included in the original) and a "Soul Shrine", a place where the player can fight monsters continuously. Three new spells also appear: Flood, Valor, and Gravija, and several bugs from the original (such as the Vanish/Doom glitch and the Evade Bug) are fixed. In addition, similarly to the other handheld ''Final Fantasy'' re-releases, a bestiary and a music player are included. Interestingly, even in the Japanese version, the music player is in English and uses the American names, e.g. ''Strago'' over ''Stragus''. The package features new artwork by series veteran and original character and image designer [[Yoshitaka Amano]]. While most of the edits and [[censorship]]s from the original "''Final Fantasy III''" version are also edited in the GBA port, and while a scene involving Celes being punched by a soldier was completely removed (specific to this version), many of the edited and mature themes prevalent in the game's dialogue have been expressed more clearly in this version.
