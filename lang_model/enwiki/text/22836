'''William Morgan DeBeck''' (April 15, 1890 <U+2013> November 11, 1942), better known as '''Billy DeBeck''', was an American [[cartoonist]].  He is most famous as the creator of the [[comic strip]] ''Barney Google'' (later retitled ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith]]'').  The strip was especially popular in the 1920s and 1930s, and featured a number of well-known characters, including the title character, Bunky, Snuffy Smith and Spark Plug the race horse.  Spark Plug was a merchandising phenomenon, and has been called the [[Snoopy]] of the 1920s.

DeBeck drew with a scratchy line, and his characters had giant feet and bulbous noses<U+2014>what is traditionally called a "big-foot" style.  His strips often reflected his love of sports.  The first awards of the [[National Cartoonists Society]], beginning in 1946, were the Billy DeBeck Memorial Awards (or the Barney Awards).

==Personal history==
DeBeck was born and grew up on the south side of [[Chicago]], where his father, Louis DeBeck, was a former newspaperman employed by the Swift Company.  His father was French, and the name DeBeck evolved from DeBecque.  His [[Irish people|Irish]]-[[Welsh people|Welsh]] mother, Jessie Lee Morgan, had lived on a farm and was a former schoolteacher.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}

===Early career===
DeBeck attended [[Hyde Park Career Academy|Hyde Park High School]], after which he went to the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]].  During this time, he sold [[cartoon]]s to finance himself,{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}} starting in 1908 at the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''.{{sfn|Beech|1935}}  Though he had intended to become a painter in the [[Flemish painting|Flemish tradition]], he gave it up after he landed a cartooning job with the weekly paper ''Show World'' in 1910.  His cartoons showed the influence of [[John T. McCutcheon]] and [[Clare Briggs]], whom he had admired in his youth, although he had the skill to draw in the more fastidiously [[Hatching|cross-hatched]] style of a [[Charles Dana Gibson]],{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}} and had sold drawings as originals that he had copied from Gibson.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=36}}

[[File:Billy DeBeck with Jack Dempsey 1919.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of Billy DeBeck with Jack Dempsey|Sports fan DeBeck with boxing heavyweight champion [[Jack Dempsey]] in 1919.]]
He soon left ''Show World'' for better opportunities at ''Youngstown Telegram'' in [[Ohio]] as a [[Editorial cartoonist|political cartoonist]], then again at the ''Pittsburgh Gazette-Time''{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=36}} in late August 1912, and later again he began doing cartoons for the [[New York City]] magazines ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Judge (magazine)|Judge]]''.   While in Pittsburgh, he went to a Hearst newspaper in New York and showed comic strip samples to [[Arthur Brisbane]], who rejected the work. DeBeck later admitted, "They were terrible. I had been doing political cartoons for the ''Pittsburgh Gazette'', and the comics were new to me".{{sfn|Beech|1935}}   He returned to Youngstown and married Marian Louise Shields there in 1914.  Some time later they divorced, remarried in 1921, and eventually divorced again.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=37}}  In May 1915, he and a partner, Carter, launched a newspaper syndicate and [[Distance education|correspondence]] cartooning course.  When that did not pan out, DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the ''[[Chicago American|Chicago Herald]]'' in December 1915.  He worked on a strip called ''Finn an' Haddie'' for the [[George Matthew Adams#George Matthew Adams Service|Adams Newspaper Service]] on the side.  On 9 December, immediately after starting at the ''Herald'', he began a strip called ''Married Life'' that so caught the attention of newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] that legend says he bought the ''Herald'' (merging it with the ''[[Chicago American|Chicago Examiner]]'') in order to get his hands on DeBeck,{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}} who had refused to join the Hearst empire after the ''Examiner'' raised his monthly salary from $35 to $200.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=37}}  He created a number of other features, especially for the sports section, while his antics made him something of a local celebrity.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}

===Barney Google===
[[File:Barney Google 1922-07-17.jpg|thumb|alt=''Barney Google'' comic strip featuring the first appearance of the racehorse Spark Plug|DeBeck introduced the popular race horse Spark Plug on July 17, 1922.]]
On July 17, 1919, DeBeck created a new comic strip on the sports page in the same vein as ''Married Life''.  ''Take Barney Google, For Instance'' differed in that it was about a henpecked, sports-obsessed husband and his travails defying the opposition of his wife.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}  He was interested in non-fictional sports stories, such as the current heavyweight championship between [[Jess Willard]] and [[Jack Dempsey]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=37}}  The title was soon shortened to ''[[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google]]'', but the strip was not terribly popular until DeBeck had Google acquire a race horse named Spark Plug (or "Sparky"{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=39}}) in a strip dated July 17, 1922. The dilapidated, blanket-covered horse was a huge hit with readers, a marketing and merchandising phenomenon that has been called the [[Snoopy]] of the 1920s<U+2014>toys, balloons and games were among the popular items adorned with Sparky's image.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=39}}  When DeBeck introduced the horse, he also introduced a little-used technique into the strip<U+2014>continuity. ''Barney Google'' went from being a gag-a-day strip to one in which both humor and suspense kept readers coming back every day, as Google desperately tried to get his horse to win a race.  The sequence in which Spark Plug was introduced into the strip was republished in the October 1922 issue of ''Comic Monthly'', what is likely the earliest newsstand comics periodical.  Barney had been as tall as his wife when the strip began, but by the early 1920s, DeBeck had made him quite short.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}

[[File:Bughousebook22.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Book cover|Billy DeBeck used Barney Google as a byline on the earliest ''Bughouse Fables'' panels.]]
DeBeck kept readers on the edge of their seats with his uncertain suspense<U+2014>sometimes Spark Plug actually won a race.  In 1923, [[Billy Rose]] penned a smash pop hit called ''Barney Google'' with the catchy refrain: "Barney Google, with the goo-goo-gooly eyes".  While DeBeck initially resisted, Hearst demanded a pretty girl be introduced into the strip.  DeBeck brought in Sweet Mama, which initially created a stir, with papers dropping the strip, but after the phrase swept the nation, the strip's popularity only increased.  Over the years, DeBeck was credited with introducing more [[neologism]]s and [[catchphrase]]s, such as "[[heebie-jeebies (idiom)|heebie-jeebies]]", "[[wikt:horsefeathers|horsefeathers]]", "hotsy totsy", "osky wow wow", "bughouse fables",{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}} "balls of fire" and "time's a-wastin'".{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}}

DeBeck had included a [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] called ''Bughouse Fables'' (signed "Barney Google"{{sfn|Waugh|1947|p=54}}) with his main strip since 1921, though he soon handed off to assistant [[Paul Fung]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=37}}  On May 16, 1926, he replaced ''Bughouse Fables'' with ''Parlor, Bedroom & Sink Starring Bunky'', a strip that was popular enough on its own to survive until 1948.{{sfn|Markstein|, "Bunky"}}

According to later ''Barney Google and Snuffy Smith'' scripter Brian Walker, DeBeck had become "one of the highest-paid cartoonists in America" at this point.{{sfn|Hartzell|2000}}  In the early 1920s, DeBeck moved to Riverside Drive in New York City, and in 1927 he would remarry to Mary Louise Dunne.  He and his new wife spent the next two years in Europe, after which they settled down again in New York.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=37}} DeBeck's active lifestyle sometimes caused him to miss deadlines. He enjoyed traveling, deep sea fishing, [[golf]] and playing [[bridge (card game)|bridge]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}} As a golfer since 1916, DeBeck spent time on courses with such notables as [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Rube Goldberg]], [[Fontaine Fox]], [[Clarence Budington Kelland]] and bridge authority [[P. Hal Sims]]. He was also acquainted with such celebrities as [[Babe Ruth]], [[Lowell Thomas]] and [[Damon Runyon]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}} His best friend was the cartoonist [[Frank Willard]], who also attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.{{sfn|Beech|1935}}

===Snuffy Smith===
In the spring of 1934, DeBeck hired 17-year-old Fred Lasswell as an assistant after seeing his work on a poster. He wanted a letterer for ''Barney Google'', and Lasswell's lettering impressed him. Lasswell started by doing chores for DeBeck, as well as taking on lettering and other duties on the strip. DeBeck undertook educating Lasswell in cartooning, having him attend schools, copy the works of masters like [[Charles Dana Gibson|Gibson]] and [[Phil May (caricaturist)|May]], and copy line-for-line the artwork from DeBeck's own comics. Lasswell moved in with the DeBecks, and would tag along with them wherever they moved. He would take over his mentor's strip after his death and continue it into the 21st century.{{sfnm|1a1=Davison Reynolds|1y=2003|1p=38|2a1=Harvey|2y=2012|2loc=part 1}}

DeBeck gained a growing interest into the culture of [[Appalachia]] in the 1930s and amassed a library on the subject that he would later donate to [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. The character Snuffy Smith grew from his talking with and sketching the Appalachian [[hillbilly]] locals. Just as the strip's circulation was starting to flag,{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}} Snuffy was introduced in a storyline in which Barney had inherited an estate in the mountains of [[North Carolina]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=40}}  After dodging the ornery hillbilly's bullets, the two became fast friends. The strip would eventually be renamed ''Barney Google and Snuffy Smith'', and Snuffy would take over from Barney Google as the central character.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}} Lasswell, with his own country roots, provided much of the inspriration for Snuffy and his Appalachian environment. Especially, he provided a source for the locals' dialect.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}

===Later life and death===
DeBeck had a [[studio apartment]] on [[Park Avenue]] in New York, and homes in [[Great Neck, Long Island]] and [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}} In the early 1940s, he developed cancer, and found it increasingly difficult to work. Sensing the end was near, he made a special trip to see Marian Shields.{{sfn|Hartzell|2000}}  His last signed [[daily comic strip|daily strip]] appeared 4 July 1942, and his last [[Sunday strip|Sunday]] the following 2 August. With Lasswell contributing to the [[World War II|war effort]], the strip was continued by assistant Joe Musial.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 2}} On 11 November 1942, DeBeck died at the age of 52 in New York City, with his wife at his bedside.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}}  He had no children.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}  ''Barney Google'' was continued by Musial until Lasswell took it on full-time in 1945.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=38}}  Eventually Barney faded from the strip, and the title shrank to ''Snuffy Smith''.{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=40}}

In 1943, Mary DeBeck donated to the [[Ringling College of Art and Design|Ringling School of Art]] all of her late husband's art supplies, including [[drawing table]]s, reams of drawing paper, hundreds of colored pencils, lamps, drawing boards, inks, drawing pens, artist smocks, etching plates and an etching press.{{sfn|Sarasota Herald-Tribune staff|1943}}  Mary remarried, and she died 14 February 1953, aboard a [[National Airlines (NA)|National Airlines]] [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]] which went down in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] during a thunderstorm on a flight from [[Tampa, Florida]] to [[New Orleans]].{{sfn|St. Petersburg Times staff|1953}}

==Style==
[[File:Billy DeBeck - Married Life 1918-05-06.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Early DeBeck comic strip|''Married Life'' an early hit for DeBeck, landed him in the [[William Randolf Hearst|Hearst]] empire.]]
DeBeck's art style falls in the "big-foot" tradition of American comic strips such as ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'', ''[[H<U+00E4>gar the Horrible]]'' and [[Robert Crumb]].  He had a scratchy line, and drew characters with bulbous noses and giant feet.  Though he often procrastinated, he could work fast and make it just in time for his deadlines.{{sfn|Harvey|2012|loc=part 1}}

==Legacy==
DeBeck's main strip, in the hands of Fred Lasswell, continued long after its creator's death. In 1989, the strip was still running in 900 newspapers in 21 countries,{{sfn|Davison Reynolds|2003|p=39}} and it continues to this day in different hands since Lasswell's 2001 death. [[Charles M. Schulz]], creator of the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, is famously nicknamed "Sparky" after DeBeck's racehorse character,{{sfn|Markstein|, "Barney Google"}} and DeBeck's drawing style has been an influence on such cartoonists as [[Robert Crumb]]{{sfnm|1a1=Estren|1y=1993|1p=60|2a1=Heer|2y=2010}} and [[Bobby London]].{{sfn|Grandinetti|2004|p=16}}

The ''Barney Google'' [[Sunday strip|Sunday page]] for September 18, 1938 was placed in the [[time capsule]] at the [[1939 World's Fair]].{{sfnm|1a1=Szondy|2a1=New York Times Magazine staff|2y=1953}}

===Billy DeBeck Memorial Award===
The [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s annual award was originally named the Billy DeBeck Memorial Award. Created by Mary DeBeck Bergman in 1946, these were known as the Barney Awards. She also made the annual presentation of engraved silver cigarette cases, with DeBeck's characters etched on the cover, to the winners ([[Milton Caniff]], [[Al Capp]], [[Chic Young]], [[Alex Raymond]], [[Roy Crane]], [[Walt Kelly]], [[Hank Ketcham]] and [[Mort Walker]]). In 1954, after her death, the DeBeck Award was renamed the [[Reuben Award]] (after [[Rube Goldberg]]'s first name), and all of the prior winners were given Reuben statuettes.{{sfnm|1a1=Davison Reynolds|1y=2003|2p=38|2a1=Harvey|2y=, The History of the NCS}}
