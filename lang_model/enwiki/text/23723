Opened in 1925, '''Meeth Halt''' was a small railway station on the [[North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway]], a private line until it became part of the  [[Southern Region of British Railways]] in 1948<ref> '''Branch Lines to Torrington''' Mitchell,V & Smith,K: Midhurst, Middleton Press,1994 ISBN 1873793375</ref>. The line was built in part over narrow gauge line that was used from 1881 to take [[Ball clay|ball clay]] from claypits at Marland and Meeth to [[Torrington railway station|Torrington]], which was until 1925 the terminus of a branch from [[Barnstaple railway station|Barnstaple]].  

The line was closed to passenger traffic in 1965 as part of the [[Beeching]] proposals, but remained open for freight from the Meeth clay workings north of Meeth Halt through Torrington to Barnstaple up to 1982<ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/c1147820.html Freight details]</ref>. Occasionally, railway memorabilia connected with the station surfaces, <ref>[http://www.paddingtonticketauctions.co.uk/t33/cat.html See  Lot 102]</ref>. 

The station consisted of a simple short concrete platform and a stone shelter and remains as a recognisable landmark on the Tarka Trail, a very popular destination for long distance walkers and cyclists<ref>[http://www.discoverdevon.com/dbimgs/Tarka%20Trail%20Cycleway%20Braunton%20to%20Meeth.pdf Local authority details]</ref>. As a result, it is in the process of a major renovation<ref>[http://www.westdevon.gov.uk/planningapp/ApplicationDetails.aspx?planningid=10530/2007/OKE Planning application]</ref>.
