'''Atum'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}, sometimes rendered as '''Atem''' or '''Tem''', is an important [[deity]] in [[Egyptian mythology]].

== Name ==

Atum's name is thought to be derived from the word 'tem' which means to complete or finish.  Thus he has been interpreted as being the 'complete one' and also the finisher of the world, which he returns to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle.  As creator he was seen as the underlying substance of the world, the deities and all things being made of his flesh or alternatively being his [[Egyptian soul#Ka (life force)|ka]].

== Origins ==

Atum is one of the most important and frequently mentioned deities from earliest times, as evidenced by his prominence in the [[Pyramid Texts]], where he is portrayed as both a creator and father to the king.  He is usually depicted as a man wearing either the royal head-cloth or the dual white and red crown of [[Upper Egypt]], and [[Lower Egypt]], reinforcing his connection with kingship.  Sometimes he also is shown as a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], the form which he returns to at the end of the creative cycle and also occasionally as a [[mongoose]], [[lion]], [[Bull (mythology)|bull]], [[lizard]], or [[ape]].

== Role ==

In the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|Heliopolitan creation myth]], Atum was considered to be the first god, having created  himself, sitting on a mound ([[benben]]) (or identified with the mound itself), from the primordial waters ([[Naunet|Nu]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=The British Museum|title=Picture List|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/1.1.4-PICTURE.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>  Early myths state that Atum created the god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and [[goddess]] [[Tefnut]] from spitting her out of his mouth.<ref>[http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html#Atum Egyptian gods Atum] URL accessed December 30, 2006.</ref>

In the [[Old Kingdom]] the Egyptians believed that Atum lifted the dead king's soul from his pyramid to the starry heavens.<ref>http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html#Atum retrieved November 9, 2006</ref> He was also a [[solar deity]], associated with the primary sun god [[Ra]]. Atum was linked specifically with the evening sun, while Ra was associated more with the morning sun.<ref>Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames & Hudson. p. 205</ref>

== Relationship to other gods ==

Atum was a self-created deity, the first being to emerge from the darkness and endless watery abyss that girdled the world before creation. A product of the energy and matter contained in this chaos, he created divine and human beings through loneliness: alone in the universe, he produced from his own sneeze, or in some accounts, semen, Shu, the god of air, and Tefnut, the goddess of moisture. The brother and sister, curious about the primeval waters that surrounded them went to explore the waters and disappeared into the darkness. Unable to bear his loss, Atum sent a fiery messenger to find his children. The tears of joy he shed on their return were the first human beings.

== Iconography ==

He is generally represented in human form, and as the source of the Pharaoh's power he wears the double crown of Egypt- red for Lower Egypt, White for Upper Egypt and he also carries a tall cross, the symbol of eternal life.

== Worship ==

Atum's [[cult]] centered on the city of [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]] ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: ''Annu'').

==Iusaaset, the grandmother of deities==

Another belief held that Shu and Tefnut were created by Atum having [[sexual intercourse]] with a goddess, referred to as [[Iusaaset]] (also spelt Juesaes, Ausaas, Iusas, and Jusas, and in Greek as Saosis), meaning ''the great one who comes forth''. She was described as his [[shadow]] or his hand. Consequently, Iusaaset was seen as the mother and grandmother of the gods. The strength, [[Hardiness (plants)|hardiness]], [[Pharmaceutical chemistry|medical properties]], and [[edible|edibility]], led the [[acacia]] tree to be considered the ''[[tree of life]]'', and thus the oldest, which was situated close to, and north of, [[Heliopolis (ancient)|Heliopolis]], was said to be the birthplace of the deities. Thus, as the mother and grandmother, of the deities, Iusaaset was said to own this tree.
