'''Spoo''' is a fictional food product that served as a running joke within the ''[[Babylon 5]]'' [[science fiction]] television series.  In the series' [[fictional universe]], spoo is made from worm-like creatures of the same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious food in the galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species.<ref name=lane />{{rp|87}} Despite appearing in only a few episodes, fans embraced spoo and it became part of the series' [[Expanded Universe|extended mythology]].<ref name=lane />{{rp|86-88}}

Straczynski's usage of the word "spoo" to denote a food item predates ''Babylon 5''.

==''Babylon 5''==
===Origins===
Spoo appeared in the first episode of the science fiction television series ''Babylon 5'', where it was briefly mentioned by the [[Narn]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|Ambassador]], [[G'Kar]].<ref name=lane />{{rp|86-88}} [[J. Michael Straczynski]], the show's creator, executive producer, and writer of the episode in question, was asked about spoo by fans on various internet message boards on which he frequently [[Internet marketing and fan influence on Babylon 5|participated]].<ref>Straczynski's use of internet forums is well known. See, for instance: {{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/j.-michael-straczynski/person/19536/biography.html |title= J. Michael Straczynski Biography|work=[[tv.com]]|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]  |accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> At first, Straczynski's responses were terse: "Spoo is."<ref name=SpooIs>{{cite web|date=1994-01-27|url=http://www.jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-13771|title="Questions for JMS (some spoile"|publisher=JMSNews.com (archived from rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.moderated)|accessdate=2008-12-07|last=Straczynski|first=J.

Michael}}</ref>

After years of speculation from ''Babylon 5'' [[fandom|fans]], Straczynski finally offered an extensive explanation of the origins and nature of spoo. He said spoo are tiny, pasty, [[mealworm]]-like creatures that travel slowly in herds. Their main behavior is sighing, which "can reportedly induce unparalleled bouts of depression"<ref name=lane />{{rp|87}} in other creatures. They are raised on ranches and harvested through "whacking." Spoo are regarded with contempt by most [[Civilizations in Babylon 5|species in ''Babylon 5'']]; they "are the only creatures of which the Interstellar Animal Rights Protection League says, simply, 'Kill 'em.'"<ref name=lane />{{rp|87}} Despite this, they are "generally considered the most delicious food in all of known space."<ref name=lane />{{rp|87}}

Although mostly relegated to a background role, spoo was a key plot point in the season 5 episode "[[A Tragedy of Telepaths]]". The fact that Narn prefer fresh spoo while the [[Centauri]] prefer it aged was the clue that [[G'Kar]] used to figure out that there was another Narn in the Centauri Royal Palace.<ref name=lane2 />{{rp|148}}  Spoo is referenced in the Straczynski-authored [[open gaming license]]d ''Babylon 5: The Roleplaying Game''.<ref>{{cite book|first=J.
