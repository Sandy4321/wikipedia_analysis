'''Oak Island Yard''' is a [[rail yard]] located north of [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]] and [[Newark International Airport]] in an industrial area of [[Ironbound]] [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. At its western end near [[Hunter Connection]] the [[Raritan Valley Line]] joins the [[Northeast Corridor]]. At its eastern end it becomes the [[Lehigh Line (Conrail)|Lehigh Line]]. To the east is the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad Bridge]] which spans [[Newark Bay]] as the part of the [[National Docks Secondary]]. The yard was built by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] in 1903, becoming part of the [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]]'s [[North Jersey Shared Assets Area]] in 1976. Currently it's shared by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]].
