'''Fran<U+00E7>ois "Francis" Xavier Matthieu''' (1818-1914) was a [[French Canadian]] settler of the [[Oregon Country]] who was one of the people involved in forming the [[Provisional Government of Oregon|provisional government]] of what would become the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]]. Later he served in the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] and was the last surviving participant of the [[Champoeg Meetings]].

==Biography==
===Early life===

Fran<U+00E7>ois Xavier Matthieu was born on April 2, 1818 in [[Terrebonne, Quebec]], [[Canada]], to Fran<U+00E7>ois and Louise Matthieu (''[[n<U+00E9>e]]'' Daufin).<ref name=Oregon>Howard M. Corning, ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.</ref> In Canada he was educated under a tutor named Velade.<ref name=Oregon/>

In 1835 Matthieu became involved with the [[Sons of Liberty]], who waged an armed uprising remembered to history as [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Papineau<U+2019>s Rebellion]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] rule.<ref name=Oregon/> The youth was engaged making musket shot and transporting arms to the scene of the fighting.<ref name=Dead /> His efforts, seen as treasonous by the British, were discovered and Matthieu was ultimately forced to flee Canada for refuge in the United States,<ref name=Dead /> crossing the border there by means of  a forged passport.<ref name=Oregon/> 

Upon arrival in the United States, Matthieu worked for a time as a carpenter in [[Albany, New York]].<ref name=OPA>"Francis Xavier Matthieu," ''Transactions of the Forty-Second Annual Reunion of the Oregon Pioneer Association, Portland, June 25, 1914; pg. 96.</ref> He moved to Chicago in 1839 and then to St. Louis.<ref name=OPA /> It was in the latter city that Matthieu met [[Jean Pierre Chouteau]], a representative of the [[American Fur Company]]. Chouteau hired Matthieu as a frontier clerk in charge of trappers and traders working among Native American tribes in the Midwest.<ref name=Himes>{{cite news | last =Himes | first =George H. | title =New Year's Day With F. X. Matthieu | newspaper =The Oregonian | location =Portland | pages =26 | publisher =Henry Pittock | date =January 5, 1908 | url =http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn83045782/1908-01-05/ed-1/seq-26/ | accessdate = February 15, 2015}}</ref> 

Matthieu subsequently spent three years in the fur trade on the [[Platte River]] and its tributaries.<ref name=OPA /> He would ultimately leave for Oregon as a result of disaffection with the company's policy of supplying alcohol to the Native American population<ref name=Dead /> <U+2014> sales which would sometimes lead to catastrophic drunken situations from which multiple murders would result.<ref name=Clarke />

===Oregon pioneer===

Matthieu came to the Oregon Country with the [[Elijah White]] party September 25, 1842, spending his first winter with fellow pioneer [[<U+00C9>tienne Lucier]] and discussing politics and government.<ref name="CN">Philip Cogswell, Jr., ''Capitol Names: Individuals Woven Into Oregon's History.'' Portland, OR: [[Oregon Historical Society]], 1977; pg. 57.</ref> In Oregon he once again returned to practice the carpenter's trade.<ref name=Clarke>S.A. Clarke, [http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2251383/pioneer_days_a_life_sketch_of/ "Pioneer Days: A Life Sketch of F.X. Matthieu, of Marion, a Pioneer of 1842,"] ''The Morning Oregonian,'' vol. 5, no. 39 (Aug. 29, 1886), pg. 2.</ref>

On May 2, 1843, a [[Champoeg Meetings|meeting]] of the settlers in the region was held on [[French Prairie]] at [[Champoeg, Oregon|Champoeg]], and a decision was to be made as to whether the pioneers would form a government to rule over themselves.<ref name=Oregon/> Some 102 people were present<ref>"Pioneers Will Meet Again at Champoeg," ''Oregon Daily Journal,'' April 23, 1913, pg. 6.</ref> <U+2014> a majority of the European population of the Oregon Territory at that time. These were initially evenly divided, 51-51, over the question.<ref name=Dead>[http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2251555/francis_xavier_matthieu_dead_pioneer/""Francis Xavier Matthieu Dead: Pioneer Last Champoeg Patriot: His Vote Save Oregon to Union,"] ''Oregon Daily Journal,'' vol. 12, no. 285 (Feb. 4, 1914), pp. 1, 4.</ref>

As tension over the standoff mounted, Matthieu was one of two individuals to break ranks with backers of British rule, voting instead for formation of an independent [[Provisional Government of Oregon]].<ref name=Dead /> Matthieu's vote therefore proved decisive,<ref name=GatherAgain>"Oregon Pioneers Gather Again at Champoeg Shrine: F.X. Matthieu, 93 Years Old, Sole Survivor of Historic Meeting 68 Years Ago, Hopes to Be Present," ''Oregon Sunday Journal,'' April 30, 1911, pg. 14.</ref> and he would be celebrated in his twilight years as the man "whose vote saved Oregon" for the United States.<ref name=Dead />

Matthieu settled on French Prairie and owned a [[general store|general merchandising business]] in [[Butteville, Oregon|Butteville]], a small town which he founded located in rural [[Marion County, Oregon|Marion County]].<ref name="CN"/> On April 12, 1844, he married Rosalie Aussant, and the couple would have 15 children.<ref name=Oregon/> In 1846 Matthieu filed a [[Provisional Government of Oregon#Laws|provisional land claim]] on 640 acres nearby, later refiling as a [[Donation Land Claim]] in 1850.<ref name=Himes/> Butteville post office was established in 1850 with name of Champoeg, and with Matthieu as the first postmaster.<ref name="OGN">Lewis A. McArthur and [[Lewis L. McArthur]], ''Oregon Geographic Names.'' [1928]. Seventh Edition. Portland, OR: Oregon Historical Society Press, 2003.</ref>

During the [[California Gold Rush]] Matthieu attempted to make his fortune transporting provisions and mercantile goods to the mines.<ref name=Clarke /> Matthieu unfortunately fell ill on the way and wound up losing all 14 mules and the goods they were packing during his sickness, thereby dealing him a heavy financial blow.<ref name=Clarke /> He also schemed on making use of Native Americans as mineworkers, but scurvy and diarrhea lead to massive deaths among the first party accompanying him to California and the plan fell to nothing.<ref name=Clarke />

In 1873 Matthieu was elected the first president of the newly reorganized [[Oregon Pioneer Association]].<ref name=OPA /> He would remain a stalwart member of that organization, attending virtually every one of the group's annual meetings up to the time of his death.<ref name=OPA /> He was also a [[Free mason|Mason]] from 1855,<ref name=OPA /> helping to organize the first Masonic lodge in Oregon.<ref>June MacMillan Ordway, [http://www.newspapers.com/clip/2251465/pioneer_could_not_eat_dog_meat/ "Pioneer Could Not Eat Dog Meat,"] ''Oregon Sunday Journal,'' April 2, 1911, pg. 61.</ref>

===Political career===

In 1874, he was elected as a Democrat to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] to represent Marion County.<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1874reg.html Oregon Legislative Assembly (8th) 1874 Regular Session.] Oregon State Archives, accessed September 30, 2007.</ref> Matthieu returned to the legislature in 1878, again representing Marion County.<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1878reg.html Oregon Legislative Assembly (10th) 1878 Regular Session.] Oregon State Archives, accessed September 30, 2007.</ref>

===Death and legacy===

In his later years, Matthieu made his home in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in a house located at 351 NE Eugene Street on the city's East side.<ref name=GatherAgain />

Matthieu died on February 4, 1914, at a daughter's home in Butteville.<ref name=Dead /> He was the longest-surviving member of the 102 participants at the 1843 Champoeg Meetings.<ref name="CN"/>
