==Early life==
Demaine was born at [[Bradford]], [[Yorkshire]], to parents Joseph Demaine, cabinetmaker,<ref name=adb>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/demaine-william-halliwell-5948 Demaine, William Halliwell (1859<U+2013>1939)] &mdash; [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]. Retrieved 7 April 2015.</ref> and Elizabeth (n<U+00E9>e Halliwell).<ref name=qp/> At around age 15, he went with his family to Uruguay and Argentina where he worked as a [[Printer (publishing)|printer]], returning to England in 1879.<ref name=adb/> He landed in  [[Queensland]] in March of 1880 and began work as a [[joiner]] for Fairlie & Sons and within two years had formed a Eight Hour Association and participated in a campaign to remove black labour from the sugar industry.<ref name=adb/>

Leaving Fairlie & Sons in 1890, he set about forming the General Labourers' Union, which was later absorbed into the [[Australian Workers' Union]] and as Secretary of the Wide Bay and Burnett Branch of the Australian Labor Federation, he helped organize support for the shearers in the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|1891 strike]].<ref name=adb/>

In 1892, Demaine represented the Maryborough Workers' Political Organization at the first Labor-in-Politics convention before being elected to the central political executive in 1892-94. Along with [[Charles McGhie]], he founded the weekly newspaper ''Alert''<ref name=qp/> which he edited until his death. In 1901 he once again attended the Labor-in-Politics convention and until 1938, every convention thereafter. Elected president of the central political executive  in 1916, he held the role unopposed for the next 22 years.<ref name=adb/>
 
==Political career==
When the Labour Party starting forming governments in Queensland, it found much of its legislation being blocked by a hostile Council, where members had been appointed for life by successive conservative governments. After a failed [[referendum]] in May 1917,<ref name=1917referendum>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article20143466 |title=TWO HOUSES, NOT ONE. |newspaper=[[Courier-Mail|The Brisbane Courier (Qld. : 1864<U+2013>1933)]] |location=Qld. |date=7 May 1917 |accessdate=7 April 2015 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Premier [[T.J.

Demaine was one of the thirteen new members, and went on to serve for four and a half years until the Council was abolished in March, 1922.<ref name=qp/> He was also an alderman on the Maryborough Council on two separate occasions - 1896 to 1900 and 1924-1939, serving as mayor for the final six years.<ref name=qp/>
