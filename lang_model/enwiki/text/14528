"'''Mothers of the Disappeared'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''. The song was inspired by lead singer [[Bono]]'s experiences in Nicaragua and El Salvador in July 1986, following U2's involvement on Amnesty International's [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. While in Central America, he met members of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo|Madres de Plaza de Mayo]], whose children had been [[forced disappearances|forcibly disappeared]] by the Argentinean and Chilean governments.<ref name="McGee98" /> Bono sympathized with the Madres and wanted to pay tribute to their cause.

The song was written on a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]], and the melody lifted from a piece Bono composed to help teach children basic forms of hygiene while in Ethiopia in 1985. The lyrics contain an implicit criticism of the Reagan Administration for backing the regimes who seized power during two coup d'<U+00E9>tats and caused the disappearances.

U2 have rarely performed the song live. It was played seven times on the 1987 [[Joshua Tree Tour]], and some recordings were considered for the ending sequence of the 1988 film ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''. It was revived for four concerts on the 1998 [[PopMart Tour]] in South America, and the Madres joined the band onstage for the performance on two of those occasions. The track was favourably received by critics, who variously described it as "a simple lament",<ref name="WP" /> "powerful",<ref name="Morse" /> and "stunning beauty and sadness".<ref name="Thrills" />

==Background and inspiration==
{{Quote box|quote="'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government."|source=<U+2014>Adam Clayton<ref name="album notes2007" /> |width=25% |align=left |style=padding:8px;}}

Recording sessions for ''The Joshua Tree'' began in January 1986 in [[Danesmoate House]] in Dublin, Ireland, and continued throughout the year.<ref name="McGee93" /> U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] tour. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer [[Bono]] met Ren<U+00E9> Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the fascist Chilean government because his artwork criticised the [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a [[1973 Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coup d'<U+00E9>tat]].<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 76</ref><ref>Herrera (1988), p. 36</ref> Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the [[Mission District, San Francisco|Mission District]] that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina.<ref name="Film" />

[[File:Que digan d<U+00F3>nde estan.jpg|image|thumb|200px|Many of the disappeared were students who opposed the government during the Dirty War.]]

Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, travelling to [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]] to see firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. During the trip, he met the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo|Madres de Plaza de Mayo]], a group of women whose children were [[forced disappearances|forcibly disappeared]] by the Argentinian government.<ref name="McGee98">McGee (2008), p. 98</ref> The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the [[Dirty War]], and the coup d'<U+00E9>tat that brought [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] into power.<ref name="Graham">Graham (2004), p. 35</ref> The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.<ref>Stokes (2005), p. 77</ref><ref name="U2byU2" /> 

In 2006, Bono recounted an experience in Salvador when he had seen a body in the road, remarking, "People would just disappear. If you were part of the opposition, you might find an SUV with the windows blacked out parked outside your house... If that didn't stop you, occasionally they would come in and take you and murder you; there would be no trial."<ref name="U2byU2">McCormick (2006), p. 184</ref> Bono understood the cause of the Madres and wanted to pay tribute to it.<ref name="U2byU2" /> His experiences in Central America inspired the lyrics of "Mothers of the Disappeared" and another track from ''The Joshua Tree'', "[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]".<ref name="westwon">{{cite journal |title=How the West Was Won |magazine=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |date=8 September 2003}}</ref><ref>Cogan (2008), p. 125</ref>

==Writing, recording, and composition==
{{Quote box|quote="...&nbsp;I was singing about how 'in the rain we see their tears,' the tears of those who have been disappeared.

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was created and [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] at guitarist The Edge's newly-bought home, Melbeach, which U2 used as a recording studio.<ref name="McGee93">McGee (2008), p. 93</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' (Part 1) |magazine=[[Hot Press]] |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |date=21 November 2007}}</ref> Bono wrote the song on his mother-in-law's [[Spanish guitar]], and drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] created a drum loop that was sampled by producer [[Brian Eno]]. He used a piano as a percussive instrument and mixed the result with the drum loop through a [[Lexicon (company)|PCM70]] [[effects unit]] to create a sound which was "eerie and foreign and scary".<ref name="U2byU2" /><ref name="Secret2">{{cite journal |title=The Secret History of 'The Joshua Tree' (Part 2) |magazine=Hot Press |first=Colm |last=O'Hare |date=21 November 2007}}</ref><ref name="ClassicAlbum" /> Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] stated that the melody came from a song that Bono wrote in Ethiopia in 1985 to teach children about basic methods of hygiene.<ref name="U2byU2" /> 

In December 1986, Bono stated that he had a love-hate relationship with America, and that this was influencing his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with the Madres in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, "There's no question in my mind of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]'s involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make."<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Enduring Chill: Bono and the Two Americas |date=December 1986 |journal=Propaganda |issue=4}}</ref> Clayton called Bono's singing "prehistoric", saying "it connects with something very primitive."<ref name="U2byU2" />

Producer [[Daniel Lanois]] was the principal mixer of the song.<ref name="ClassicAlbum" /> Bono described Lanois's mix as a performance, recalling that he had used the studio as an instrument to achieve the end result. Lanois stated that the [[audio signal processing|processing]] of Mullen's beat, which resulted in a drone-like sound, became the song's backbone and personality.<ref name="ClassicAlbum" /> Clayton described it as "evocative of that sinister death squad darkness".<ref name="westwon" /><ref name="ClassicAlbum">{{cite video |people=King, Philip, and Nuala O'Connor (directors) |title=[[Classic Albums]]: U2 - The Joshua Tree |medium=Television documentary |publisher=Isis Productions |date=1999}}</ref> Colm O'Hare of ''[[Hot Press]]'' felt it was "the key sonic element" because it "[evokes] an abstract sense of evil and dread".<ref name="Secret2" />

At the conclusion of the lyrics sheet for the song in the liner notes of ''The Joshua Tree'', U2 listed addresses for several branches of Amnesty International.<ref name="album notes" /><ref name="WP">{{cite news |title=U2 Can Be Famous; Breaking Into the Big Time With 'Joshua Tree' |first=Richard |last=Harrington |newspaper=Washington Post |date=22 March 1987}}</ref> In 1998, Bono re-recorded the song [[a cappella]] in English and Spanish for the album ''<U+00A1>Ni Un Paso Atras!''

==Live performances==
U2 have rarely performed "Mothers of the Disappeared" live. They debuted the song on 14 April 1987 in San Diego, California, on the first leg of the [[Joshua Tree Tour]], where it closed the concert in place of the band's long-time finale "[[40 (song)|40]]".<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 97</ref> It was performed three more times on the leg; twice to open the encore and once to conclude the main set.<ref>de la Parra (2003), pp. 99<U+2013>100, 102</ref> U2 revived the song seven months later on the third leg, playing it in the encore at three of the final four concerts on the tour.<ref name="Film">de la Parra (2003), pp. 119<U+2013>121</ref> 

The final two performances, in Tempe, Arizona on 19 and 20 December 1987, were filmed for the 1988 film ''[[Rattle and Hum#Film|Rattle and Hum]]''.<ref name="Film" /> U2 decided to sing the refrain "el pueblo vencera", which means "a people united will overcome" in Spanish, at the conclusion of the song. Bono noted that the Madres use the phrase for motivation. The Edge said "we're so close to a Spanish speaking part of the world, we felt that maybe people at the concert might pick up on this lyric."<ref name="Film" /> Bono added that they had closed every concert since 1983 with the song "40", and so they were looking to replace it with "Mothers of the Disappeared" from that point on. He explained, "If the people of Arizona sing this, and if it goes into the film and onto the record, wherever we go in a way for the next few years, that will be taken up again. It'll be an interesting experiment...".<ref name="Film" /> The footage was considered for the closing sequence of the film, but the band eventually decided against including it.<ref name="Film" /> "[[Pride (In the Name of Love)]]" was used as the final live song, and "[[All I Want Is You (song)|All I Want Is You]]" was chosen to play over the credits.<ref>{{cite video |people=U2, [[Phil Joanou]] (Director) |title=[[Rattle and Hum]] |medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |date=27 October 1988}}</ref>

[[File:Desaparecidosu2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Madres de Plaza de Mayo join U2 on stage during a performance in Santiago, Chile on the PopMart Tour in 1998.]]

Following the seven performances on the Joshua Tree Tour, U2 did not perform "Mothers of the Disappeared" until 1998, on the fourth leg of the [[PopMart Tour]]. It was played at three concerts in Argentina and once in Chile, concluding all four shows. Bono sang "el pueblo vencera" at the end of each performance.<ref name="PopMart" /> The first rendition was on 5 February 1998 in Buenos Aires, where it was performed with the Madres accompanying them on stage.<ref name="PopMart">de la Parra (2003), pp. 218<U+2013>219</ref> The song was played by just Bono and The Edge and was set against footage of the Madres on the video screen. At the conclusion of the song, the band members faced the Madres and applauded, an act in which the rest of the audience joined them. Part of the performance was later included on the television documentary ''Classic Albums: The Joshua Tree''.<ref name="ClassicAlbum" />

The cost of the tickets was too expensive for many fans in South America, so the band decided to broadcast the 11 February concert in Chile live on television.<ref name="ChilePOP">McCormick (2006), p. 282</ref> Knowing that many people in the country would be watching, they elected to play "Mothers of the Disappeared" in place of "Wake Up Dead Man".<ref name="PopMart" /><ref name="ChilePOP" /> The rendition carried extra poignancy, as the stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet's regime following the coup d'<U+00E9>tat.<ref name="Global">{{cite news |title=U2: Local Act, Global Horizon (Part II) |first=Justin |last=Kavanagh |newspaper=[[The Globalist]]|date=12 September 2009}}</ref> Again it was performed solely by Bono and The Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them on stage a second time. The Madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance, an act which received a mixed reception from the audience. Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to "tell these women where are the bones of their children."<ref name="ChilePOP" /><ref name="Global" />

"Mothers of the Disappeared" was not performed for a further eight years until the fourth leg of the [[Vertigo Tour]]. It was performed on two occasions, on 26 February 2006 in Santiago and 2 March in Buenos Aires.<ref name="Vertigo">{{cite web |url=http://www.u2gigs.com/show1461.html |title=2006-02-26: Estadio Nacional - Santiago, Chile |publisher=U2Gigs |first1=Matthias |last1=M<U+00FC>hlbradt |first2=Andr<U+00E9> |last2=Axver |accessdate=22 September 2010}}<br>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2gigs.com/show1460.html |title=2006-03-02: River Plate Stadium - Buenos Aires, Argentina |publisher=U2Gigs |first1=Matthias |last1=M<U+00FC>hlbradt |first2=Andr<U+00E9> |last2=Axver |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="Willie1">{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/news/article/5334 |title=Willie's Diary: Show Day, Santiago |work=U2.com |publisher=LiveNation |first=Willie |last=Williams |date=26 February 2006 |accessdate=25 September 2010}} Note: Content only available to subscriber's.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jonathon |title=From Joshua Trees to Palm Trees |date=6 January 2007 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |pages=16<U+2013>17}}</ref> Although it was rehearsed by the full band, it was played only by Bono and The Edge in a arrangement similar to the one from the PopMart Tour, with The Edge performing the song on a [[charango]].<ref name="Vertigo" /><ref name="Willie1" /> It was played on several occasions on the third leg of the [[U2 360<U+00B0> Tour]] in place of "[[MLK (song)|MLK]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/discography/lyrics/lyric/song/89/ |title=Mothers of the Disappeared |work=U2.com |publisher=Live Nation |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/tour/article/title/absolutely-torrential/willies_diary/73/20 |title=Willie's Diary: Absolutely Torrential |work=U2.com |publisher=Live Nation |first=Willie |last=Williams |date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010}} Note: Subscription only content.</ref> One performance in Istanbul, Turkey, was dedicated to Fehmi Tosun,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/tour/date/id/4478 |title=Istanbul, TR |work=U2.com |publisher=Live Nation |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> an ethnic Kurd who was kidnapped in October 1995 and subsequently disappeared.

==Reception==
"Mothers of the Disappeared" was favourably received by critics. Steve Morse of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' called the song "powerful", describing the backing vocals as tender and choirlike.<ref name="Morse">{{cite news |title=The Joshua Tree |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |last=Morse |first=Steve |date=1 March 1987}}</ref> Adrian Thrills of ''[[NME]]'' called it "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness".<ref name="Thrills">{{cite journal |last=Thrills |first=Adrian |title=Cactus World View |work=[[NME]] |date=14 March 1987}}</ref> Nicholas Jennings of ''[[Maclean's]]'' felt that it was ''The Joshua Tree''{{'}}s "most topical song".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Joshua Tree |first=Nicholas |last=Harrington |journal=[[Maclean's|Maclean's Magazine]] |date=30 March 1987}}</ref> Richard Harrington of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' described the song as "a simple lament of great beauty and sadness pleading for the realization that ideological battles about right and left obscure the more important issue of right and wrong."<ref name="WP" /> Rating it three stars out of five, music journalist [[Andrew Mueller]] felt the track was a "wilfully downbeat finale".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mueller |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Mueller |date=April 2009 |title=The Joshua Tree |journal=The Ultimate Music Guide |issue=U2 |page=59 |publisher=''Uncut''}}</ref>

Greg Garrett, an English professor at [[Baylor University]], saw the song as an effort to "[respond] to growing interests in doing justice<U+2014>and calling to attention American failures in that regard", noting that the regimes in Latin and South America had been supported by the United States because of their anti-communist positions, even though their tactics were in opposition to the democratic values that "America claims to champion around the world".<ref>Garrett (2009), p. 97</ref> Lisa Hand of the ''[[Sunday Independent]]'' noted the influence of America on the track, remarking, "[it] does not confine itself simply to the music, but also extends to some of the lyrics. However, far from being a tribute to the star-spangled banner, the words highlight the political untruths and ambiguities which exist within the U.S. 'Mothers of the Disappeared' and 'Bullet the Blue Sky' both take a hard look at the American involvement in South America".<ref>{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Hand |newspaper=[[Sunday Independent]] |title='Joshua Tree' Blooms |date=8 March 1987}}</ref> Bono described it as "a beautiful end to the album", saying, "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me."<ref name="U2byU2" /> 

Ryan Jones of the ''Bergen Record'' felt that U2's 2000 song "[[Peace on Earth (U2 song)|Peace on Earth]]" contained echoes of "Mothers of the Disappeared" in its lyrics and the tone of the instrumental prelude.<ref>{{cite news |title=Guitar-driven U2 Gets Reacquainted With an Old Friend |first=Ryan |last=Jones |newspaper=Bergen Record |date=29 October 2000}}</ref> In reviewing the group's 2009 album ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]'', Mueller said the closing "Cedars of Lebanon" "maintains this essentially optimistic group's counter-intuitive tradition of ending their albums with rueful comedowns", likening it to "Mothers of the Disappeared".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rock juggernaut's 12th studio album is a grower |first=Andrew |last=Mueller |magazine=Uncut |date=25 February 2009}}</ref> Miranda Greer, a staffer for the fan website atU2.com, rated the song U2's fifth most political composition, calling it "a heartfelt expression of the suffering experienced by the mothers and grandmothers of the thousands of children abducted during the conflict in Central America".<ref name="Top10Political">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/news/u2-lists-top-10-political-u2-songs.html |title=U2 Lists: Top 10 Political U2 Songs |first=Miranda |last=Greer |publisher=atU2.com |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> She described the piece as "a plea for governments and their citizens to uphold human rights."<ref name="Top10Political" /> Another staff member, Lisa Zeitlinger, compared the loss of the Madres to the pain she felt when her second son was delivered stillborn, recounting how the song helped her to deal with the grief and inspired her to become more active in causes for children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/news/like-a-song-mothers-of-the-disappeared.html |title=Like a Song: Mothers of the Disappeared |first=Lisa |last=Zeitlinger |publisher=atU2.com |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

Reflecting on the applause given to the Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 magazine ''Propaganda'' called the result "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It was one of those ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment."<ref>{{cite journal |title='Click.' Inside PopMart. 'Click.'|date=July 1998 |journal=Propaganda |issue=28/29}}</ref> Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, [[1997 U2 concert in Sarajevo|Sarajevo]], Tel Aviv...&nbsp;anywhere music meant more than entertainment".<ref>{{cite journal |title=The World Put Its Arms Around Us |author=Bono |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=February 1999|issue=149}}</ref> When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings... If they don't agree with you, they will let you know <U+2014> but that doesn't mean they're not fans... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us."<ref name="ChilePOP" /> U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who was in the process of becoming a [[Senator for life]] after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.<ref name="Andora" /><ref name="ChilePOP" />
